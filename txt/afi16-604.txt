Opening paragraph: This publication implements AFPD 16-6, Arms Control Agreements, and
Department of Defense (DOD) Directive (DODD) 2060.1, Implementation of, and Compliance
with, Arms Control Agreements, by providing guidance directly associated with Air Force
implementation of, and compliance with, the Treaty on Open Skies. It applies to all Air Force
organizations responsible for implementing and complying with arms control agreements,
specifically those organizations involved with the acquisition, operation and maintenance of the
U.S. Air Force Open Skies observation aircraft and media processing facility, those
organizations that provide logistics support to the U.S. and foreign Open Skies observation
aircraft and teams, and those organizations responsible for protecting U.S. Air Force equities
against the vulnerabilities associated with the Open Skies observation regime, including Air
National Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) Units. The authorities to
waive wing/unit-level requirements in this publication are identified with a Tier (“T-0, T-1, T-2,
T-3”) number following the compliance statement. See AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms
Management, Table 1.1, for a description of the authorities associated with the Tier numbers.
Submit requests for waivers through the chain of command to the appropriate Tier waiver
approval authority, or alternately, to the Publication OPR for non-tiered compliance items. This
AFI may be supplemented at any level, but all supplements must be routed to AF/A5XP for
coordination prior to certification and approval. Refer recommended changes and questions
about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847,

                                             Chapter 2

                                           OVERVIEW

2.1. General
     2.1.1. This guidance articulates USAF processes, provides procedural guidance, and
     specifies Headquarters USAF, MAJCOMs, and unit responsibilities for implementation of
     and compliance with the OST. It also provides direction and planning factors for
     implementing the OST.
     2.1.2. This guidance provides implementation direction for USAF activities in support of the
     OST mission, including coordination and scheduling of missions; initiative development and
     coordination; training; financial oversight; Service representation in OST working groups;,
     utilization of USAF assets and personnel; and input into the U.S. Open Skies platform and
     related hardware choices. It also spells out U.S. Government (USG) and USAF
     organizational responsibilities.
     2.1.3. All U.S. forces within the territory of an OST signatory (includes all U.S. territory and
     many European countries, reference paragraph 2.3.1.) are vulnerable to overflight during
     OST observation missions in accordance with the OST. The Presidential Policy Directive
     (PPD) 15, Implementation of the Treaty on Open Skies, governs USG implementation of and
     compliance with the OST. PPD 15 is a classified document and may be obtained from
     AF/A5XP.
     2.1.4. This guidance is designed to be a basic reference and information resource to Air
     Force personnel involved with OST implementation.
     2.1.5. USAF facilities/forces directly impacted by the OST include those designated as Open
     Skies Points of Entry/Exit (POE/POX), Open Skies Airfields (OSA), Open Skies Refueling
     Airfields (OSRA), Open Skies Gateways, transit airfields, and the Open Skies Media
     Processing Facilities (OSMPF). The OST also directly impacts the base and maintenance
     facilities for the OC-135B aircraft fleet.
     2.1.6. Affected MAJCOMs (see Paragraph 4.1.5.) will develop implementation plans and
     procedures to execute this guidance.
2.2. Introduction
     2.2.1. The Eisenhower Administration originally proposed an Open Skies regime in 1955.
     Eisenhower's Open Skies regime, presented to the Soviets during the Geneva Summit in
     Switzerland, was a bilateral initiative that sought to protect against a nuclear attack by
     superior forces. At the height of the Cold War, the Soviets found this initiative unacceptable.
     2.2.2. With a decline in superpower tensions, President George H. W. Bush revived the
     Open Skies concept in 1989. Negotiations between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
     (NATO) and former Warsaw Pact nations to formulate a treaty began in Ottawa, Canada, in
     February 1990, and continued in Budapest, Hungary, in April 1990. However, these talks
     reached no conclusive agreement. With the failed Soviet coup in Moscow, Russian
     Federation, and the subsequent changes it brought, the collapsing Soviet Union agreed to
     open its territory to aerial observation. Negotiations resumed in Vienna, Austria, in
AFI16-604 28 MARCH 2012                                                                          7


   November 1991, and the multi-national OST was signed in Helsinki, Finland, on 24 March
   1992.
   2.2.3. Within the framework of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
   (OSCE), the goal of the OST is to strengthen peace, stability, and cooperative security by
   promoting openness and transparency of military forces and activities. The Treaty
   establishes a regime of aerial observations of the signatories' territory in order to gather
   information about military forces and activities. By establishing this regime of observation
   flights, the Treaty seeks to increase confidence and security among its signatories, facilitate
   verification of other arms control agreements, and provide information for crisis management
   and conflict prevention.
   2.2.4. Overflight of OST states by observing Party aircraft equipped with Treaty-compliant
   sensors will occur as the focal point of the Treaty’s confidence and security building regime.
   As a result, the entire U.S. sovereign territory and U.S. assets in any OST State Party are
   susceptible to imaging from Open Skies aircraft during observation flights.
   2.2.5. Six months after entry-into-force (EIF) the treaty was opened to accession by any
   interested State, subject to consensus by the current signatories in the Open Skies
   Consultative Commission (OSCC). The OST is not restricted geographically.
   2.2.6. Observation and demonstration flights may be flown over the entire territory of all
   signatories and take priority over regular air traffic. For the U.S. this scenario is covered in
   Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Order 7110.65T, Air Traffic Control, paragraph 9-2-
   22. Transit flights are not covered by this FAA Order. Once the flight plan is agreed upon,
   only flight safety considerations may restrict the conduct of observation flights.
   2.2.7. The OST entered-into-force on 1 January 2002.         Three years of phased
   implementation followed during which no more than 75% of the quota allocation could be
   conducted (see paragraph 2.4). The OST entered into full implementation on 1 January
   2006.
2.3. Participating States Parties
   2.3.1. States party to the OST as of 1 January 2012:

                                          Chapter 4

                   TREATY COMPLIANCE OFFICE RESPONSIBILITIES

4.1. Major Command (MAJCOM) Treaty Office Responsibilities
   4.1.1. MAJCOM arms control duties and responsibilities are derived from AF Policy
   Directive 16-6, AFI 16-601, and AFI 16-603.
   4.1.2. Each MAJCOM will ensure its subordinate installations fulfill their arms control
   implementation and compliance requirements. Specifically, AFIs 16-601 and 16-603 require
   MAJCOMs to:
      4.1.2.1. Establish an arms control office or point of contact to address applicable treaties
      and agreements;
      4.1.2.2. Ensure that personnel involved with arms control activities receive education
      and training; and
      4.1.2.3. Conduct overall arms control implementation in their command.
   4.1.3. MAJCOM Treaty Officers play a crucial role ensuring the Air Force meets its arms
   control obligations. They provide a critical link between subordinate installations, the
   MAJCOM, and the Air Staff. Their responsibilities include compliance with guidance,
   compliance planning, liaison, training, and resource management. Information on these
   specific responsibilities is provided in the paragraphs below.
   4.1.4. Duties
      4.1.4.1. Compliance Guidance.       Develop and coordinate compliance guidance for
      subordinate Wings and Units.
      4.1.4.2. Review and coordinate on higher headquarters Directives and Instructions.
      MAJCOM Treaty Officers will participate in the review and coordination of arms control
      implementation, compliance, and guidance. They will staff higher headquarters taskers to
      all pertinent organizations and will provide a consolidated MAJCOM response when
      requested.
      4.1.4.3. Implement Arms Control Guidance. MAJCOM Treaty Officers are responsible
      for ensuring subordinate installations implement DoD, Higher Headquarters, and
      MAJCOM policies to ensure compliance with arms control treaties and agreements, thus
      ensuring consistent application of guidance across MAJCOMs and at the base level.
   4.1.5. MAJCOM Open Skies Treaty Compliance Plans
      4.1.5.1. MAJCOM Treaty Officers will develop a MAJCOM-level Open Skies Treaty
      Compliance Plan to ensure standardized compliance procedures throughout their
      MAJCOM. The MAJCOM Open Skies Compliance Plan must comply with and
      complement guidance issued by higher headquarters, the DoD, and the USG. The
      MAJCOM Open Skies Compliance Plan will define procedures for adherence to the OST
      and will articulate overall MAJCOM guidance in order to ensure compliance with the
      OST. (Note: this requirement to develop a MAJCOM OST Compliance Plan is only
AFI16-604 28 MARCH 2012                                                                      27


     applicable to those MAJCOMs having within their infrastructure, installations designated
     to support OST activities (i.e., AFMC, ACC, AMC, PACAF and USAFE).
     4.1.5.2. Plans must address all subordinate installations that are affected by OST
     operations and observation activities.
     4.1.5.3. MAJCOM plans will define applicable rules/directives and task affected
     installations to support treaty requirements. In addition, MAJCOM Treaty Officers are
     responsible for maintaining and reviewing subordinate installation compliance plans.
  4.1.6. MAJCOM Treaty Officer Roles and Responsibilities
     4.1.6.1. MAJCOM Treaty Officers are responsible for coordination with MAJCOM
     programs that may impact treaty obligations.
     4.1.6.2. Some treaty obligations, like modifications to mission equipment and sensors,
     are accomplished by contractors. Affected MAJCOM Treaty Officers will coordinate
     requirements and monitor contractual agreements to ensure work is completed according
     to treaty specifications.
     4.1.6.3. MAJCOM Treaty Officers are responsible for training and guidance for
     installation personnel.
     4.1.6.4. MAJCOM Treaty Officers’ primary role, if present during an OST mission when
     the installation TCO is also present, is to observe treaty activities to improve their
     understanding of how bases support and execute their plan to comply with treaty
     protocols.
        4.1.6.4.1. While MAJCOM Treaty Officers are in an observer’s role, they may help
        the base meet OST requirements by interfacing through the installation TCO.
        4.1.6.4.2. By directing all MAJCOM Treaty Officer inputs to the installation TCO,
        the treaty team is ensured of having one consistent base point of contact for working
        issues and requesting support.
        4.1.6.4.3. The installation TCO will be the mission interface with the DTRA Escort
        Team Chief. Installation TCO responsibilities are detailed in Paragraph 4.2. (T-2)
        4.1.6.4.4. MAJCOM Treaty Officers shall not interfere with the DTRA Escort
        Team’s role in the treaty compliance process and shall not interact with the foreign
        team representatives unless they are specifically filling in for the installation TCO or
        specifically requested to do so by the DTRA Escort Team Chief.
     4.1.6.5. MAJCOM Treaty Officers, if present at a host airfield during an OST mission,
     shall not directly represent USG, DoD, or Air Force positions to either the DTRA Escort
     Team or to foreign team representatives during the execution of the OST mission. This
     includes during crew rest and cultural activities, unless the MAJCOM Treaty Officer is
     acting in the capacity of the installation TCO or asked to do so by the DTRA Escort
     Team Chief.
        4.1.6.5.1. MAJCOM Treaty Officers must have a current understanding of existing
        USG, DoD, and Air Force positions/guidance relating to the hosting of OST activities
        on U.S. territory and/or USAF bases.
28                                                                AFI16-604 28 MARCH 2012


         4.1.6.5.2. If questions arise, the MAJCOM Treaty Officer should coordinate with
         their chain of command and/or AF/A5XP for clarification. The MAJCOM Treaty
         Officer will advise the installation TCO with responses to communicate to the DTRA
         Escort Team.
     4.1.6.6. Identification and prevention of any alleged prohibited activity when the DTRA
     Escort Team and foreign team representatives are at a host airfield during an OST
     mission shall be in accordance with USG, DoD, and/or Air Force guidance and shall be
     the responsibility of the DTRA Escort Team, supported by the installation TCO, in direct
     support of treaty compliance.
         4.1.6.6.1. The MAJCOM Treaty Officer has the responsibility to promptly notify
         their chain of command, including AF/A5XP, of any alleged prohibited activity
         reported by their installation TCOs during OST activities at hosted airfields, the
         circumstances of those activities, and the resultant actions taken.
  4.1.7. Command and Control
     4.1.7.1. Effective command and control is critical for treaty implementation, especially
     during observation activities.
     4.1.7.2. Timely and accurate treaty notifications are essential to facilitate proper facility
     preparations. MAJCOM Treaty Officers are responsible for ensuring MAJCOM
     Command Post Controllers have current notification formats and use proper reporting
     procedures to notify subordinate Wings/Units and tenant organizations of upcoming OST
     events. These notification formats and reporting procedures can be obtained from
     AF/A5XP (usaf.pentagon.af-a3-5.mbx.open-skies@mail.mil) or DSN (312) 224-0676).
         4.1.7.2.1. Each MAJCOM and subordinate units must have a 24-hour point of
         contact, typically the Command Post or Operations Center, for OST notifications. It
         is vital all organizations that may be impacted receive proper and timely notifications.
         Notifications of intent to conduct observation activities over the U.S., or over nations
         hosting U.S. Air Force personnel and equipment, affect all U.S. Air Force Units on
         the territory of Open Skies participating states. However, notification of the
         observation flight route may only affect those activities along the specific flight route.
         (T-2)
  4.1.8. Liaison between Installation, MAJCOM, and AF/A5XP
     4.1.8.1. Command Focal Point. MAJCOM Treaty Officers are the focal point for OST
     matters as they affect the MAJCOM.
     4.1.8.2. Communications. MAJCOM Treaty Officers are a vital communications link
     between subordinate installations and AF/A5XP and combatant commands. They are a
     key player in sharing information across the Open Skies community. In particular,
     MAJCOM Treaty Officers keep AF/A5XP informed of any activity at designated Open
     Skies airfields that could impact OST activities (e.g., runway closures, air shows, major
     exercises/operations that impact ramp space or billeting challenges, etc.).
  4.1.9. Training
     4.1.9.1. Arms Control Training and Awareness. MAJCOM Treaty Officers are
     responsible for ensuring subordinate installation TCOs and MAJCOM personnel receive
AFI16-604 28 MARCH 2012                                                                       29


     appropriate OST training. Training can be accomplished by attending the AF Arms
     Control Overview Course, AF-level OST workshops, MAJCOM-level arms control
     workshops, or by participating in JTFs and/or U.S.-only Blue-on-Blue training activities.
     4.1.9.2. Arms Control Courses. DTRA offers annual OST courses in the Washington,
     DC, area. MAJCOM Treaty Officers and installation TCOs are highly encouraged to
     participate. Course dates are announced in advance to all MAJCOMs.
     4.1.9.3. JTFs and Blue-on-Blue training flights. Joint and U.S.-only training flights are
     valuable training activities for the aircrews, mission teams, and airfield logistics support
     personnel. These flights also exercise the notification process while validating
     operational procedures and airfield OST compliance plans. Finally, they validate
     logistics support capabilities, security procedures, and hosting responsibilities, and
     provide opportunities for TCOs and base facilities to operationally train in a near “real-
     world” environment. TCOs should strive to make these exercises as realistic as possible
     by taking time, manpower, cost, and mission team requests/desires into consideration.
     During these training activities artificial scenarios are introduced and after-hours support
     may be necessary. Logistic support to include fleet service for the expected aircraft type
     must be exercised regardless of type of aircraft used for simulation or the necessity of
     service requirements.
  4.1.10. Resource Management
     4.1.10.1. MAJCOM Treaty Officers function as resource managers monitoring arms
     control (including OST) funding and manpower. Successful execution requires close
     coordination between MAJCOM Treaty Officers, installation TCOs, and appropriate
     financial management (FM) counterparts. Budgeting and manpower requirements differ
     from base to base and MAJCOM to MAJCOM. Effective resource management is
     necessary to ensure sufficient funding and proper program execution.
     4.1.10.2. Budget. MAJCOM Treaty Officers typically act as command Program Element
     Manager (PEM) for PE 35145F. If they are not the PEM, they work closely with the
     individual filling that role.
        4.1.10.2.1. PEMs are responsible for managing resources and budgeting funds for
        MAJCOM arms control activities and ensuring MAJCOM installation requirements
        are included in budget submissions. The MAJCOM treaty office and FM work with
        the field installations to build an Execution Plan.
        4.1.10.2.2. AF/A5XP validates the MAJCOM Execution Plan by rationalizing the
        OST requirements within the Air Force arms control budget.
        4.1.10.2.3. The installation Treaty Officers provide their requirements to the
        MAJCOM Treaty Officers, which consolidate these requirements and submit them to
        AF/A5XP. MAJCOM Treaty Officers must ensure that all subordinate installation
        requirements are identified and defended, when necessary.
            4.1.10.2.3.1. MAJCOM Treaty Officers must also ensure that all requirements
            comply with fiscal requirements in the DoD FMR Vol. 5, AFI 65-601VI, Budget
            Guidance and Procedures, and AFI 65-603, Official Representation Funds.
 30                                                                 AFI16-604 28 MARCH 2012


          4.1.10.2.4. MAJCOM and subordinate installation TCOs must work closely together
          to ensure funding requests and distributions are received in a timely manner.
      4.1.10.3. Manpower. MAJCOM Treaty Officers are responsible for monitoring
      manpower authorizations and identifying and defending manpower requirements. Most
      Wings, some MAJCOMs, and other arms control billet authorizations are centrally
      managed by AF/A5XP. These billets are not under the control of MAJCOM planners.
      Moving or reclassifying a billet requires coordination and concurrence from AF/A5XP.
      In accordance with AFPD 16-6 and AFI 16-601, MAJCOM planners must ensure they
      have the appropriate billet authorizations assigned to support MAJCOM headquarters and
      subordinate Wing/Unit arms control requirements.
4.2. Installation Treaty Compliance Officer (TCO) Responsibilities
   4.2.1. Duties, Roles, and Responsibilities
      4.2.1.1. Compliance Plans. Each installation designated as an Open Skies airfield will
      have an OST compliance plan applicable to that airfield. (T-1) Those airfields not
      designated to host OST operations must have provisions to ensure appropriate support for
      OST aircraft that may divert to their airfield (for weather, emergency, or other special
      circumstance). (T-2)
          4.2.1.1.1. Because of the requirement in AFI 16-603 for installation TCOs to
          maintain installation Implementation and Compliance Plans for applicable treaties,
          even those airfields not designated to directly support OST observation activities or
          those that are potentially alternate airfields must have a plan (i.e., installation Protocol
          Plan) ready to execute if it becomes necessary. (T-3)
          4.2.1.1.2. Note: This requirement to develop an installation OST Compliance Plan is
          only applicable to those installations designated to support OST activities, i.e., Joint
          Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, HI; Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, AK; McConnell
          AFB, KS; Robins AFB, GA; Travis AFB, CA; Ellsworth AFB, SD; Wright-Patterson
          AFB, OH; and RAF Mildenhall, UK.
          4.2.1.1.3. The installation OST compliance plan will detail the logistics support to
          facilitate OST activities to ensure all OST timelines are met. These installation
          compliance plans will be coordinated with their parent MAJCOM. Provide
          completed plans to AF/A5XP through normal distribution. (T-2)
          4.2.1.1.4. The installation OST compliance plan will include, but is not limited to,
          base support procedures, escort requirements, notifications and reports, procedures to
          notify local personnel and affected organizations, security provisions, photography
          policy, weather support provisions, billeting and transportation requirements,
          protocol, and public affairs procedures. (T-3)
          4.2.1.1.5. Base activity checklists are important components of the compliance plan.
          The OST compliance plan identifies offices/organizations responsible for providing
          logistics support to the visiting observation aircraft and mission teams. The final plan
          must include a list showing all organizations tasked by the plan including other tenant
          organizations. (T-3)
          4.2.1.1.6. Suggested components of a Compliance Plan:
AFI16-604 28 MARCH 2012                                                                      31


           4.2.1.1.6.1. Services. This includes lodging, dining, and mortuary services.
           Lodging and dining arrangements must be planned in advance. Consult with the
           DTRA Open Skies Division for lodging preferences and requirements.
           4.2.1.1.6.2. Security. This section will include high and low threat security
           procedures for escorts, guards, inspector entry into controlled areas, operations
           security (OPSEC), and communications security (COMSEC). NOTE: Foreign
           inspectors must not have visibility of all of our normal security procedures. (T-2)
           Make every effort to safeguard our security procedures from foreign inspectors to
           the maximum extent practical.
              4.2.1.1.6.2.1. High threat options would be imposed if a known threat to the
              inspection is recognized. It could include measures such as posting guards
              and implementing entry control points requiring Entry Access Lists (EAL)
              granting the mission teams and local escorts authorized access to inspection
              sites and support facilities.
              4.2.1.1.6.2.2. Low threat options may require implementation of normal
              distinguished visitor procedures.
              4.2.1.1.6.2.3. OPSEC procedures such as limiting photography and access,
              and controlling travel routes will be included. The flight line and other areas
              of sensitive operations must be protected. (Reference Air Force policy on the
              use of personal cameras in paragraph 7.12.) (T-2)
              4.2.1.1.6.2.4. COMSEC concerns (e.g., how inspectors are allowed to
              communicate with their Embassy/consulate), must be included in your
              preparations. Example: If using government phone lines, have local escorts
              establish the link prior to foreign inspectors’ use. (T-2)
              4.2.1.1.6.2.5. U.S. escorts must be vigilant in observing foreign team member
              use of personal communications devices (e.g., cell phones, smart phones, etc.)
              when they are on federal property and report unusual observations to the
              DTRA Team Chief. (T-2)
           4.2.1.1.6.3. Medical.       Arrangements for emergency/non-elective medical
           treatment of mission team members must be included. The DTRA is responsible
           for the cost of all medical treatments and is billed accordingly. (T-2)
           4.2.1.1.6.4. Communications. This section must include public address systems
           for ceremonies/briefings, contact between local escorts, methods for inspectors to
           contact their embassies or sponsoring activities, or other treaty-specific items. (T-
           3)
           4.2.1.1.6.5. Transportation. All personnel transportation requirements, arrival
           through departure (covering both primary and alternate locations), and
           equipment/baggage handling to include special handling instructions for
           inspection equipment are included in this section. The TCO will attempt to
           accommodate the DTRA Team Chief’s requests for support of transportation for
           off-base and cultural activities for the foreign teams as much as practical, within
           existing guidelines/restrictions. In cases where Wing Commander approval is
32                                                       AFI16-604 28 MARCH 2012


     required for the type of activity or location, the TCO will facilitate that request.
     Procedures for facilitating movement of the foreign observation team through the
     security checkpoint/gate and onto the base must be covered in the Compliance
     Plan. (T-2)
     4.2.1.1.6.6. Funding. Considerations include specific billing and payment
     procedures. Ensure the DTRA Team Chief, or his/her designated liaison, knows
     what is required in advance. Coordinate with base activities for items DTRA
     requests to accomplish their responsibilities. Coordinate with your MAJCOM
     Treaty Officer and PEM, preferably in advance of incurring expenses, for
     reimbursement of expenses not paid by DTRA, or that DTRA will not pay. If
     DTRA is not able to fund a TCO request, O&M dollars can be pursued at the
     discretion of the local installation Commander as long as the requirement is
     authorized IAW financial regulations. (T-3)
     4.2.1.1.6.7. Public Affairs. Clearly-established ground rules on control of media
     movement and actions are necessary to prevent interference with inspections. The
     USG and DOD posture for OST flights is “response to query (RTQ).” (T-0) This
     means Open Skies Treaty personnel can respond to inquiries but not actively
     promote activities. There are no restrictions placed on articles for the base
     newspaper or website that reflect that an OST mission or activity is taking place
     or was recently completed. (T-3)
     4.2.1.1.6.8. Personnel. Personnel include base escorts, facility managers,
     baggage details, technical equipment inspection teams, and inspection support
     staff. Support staffs are individuals working real-time contingencies while the
     treaty office is busy with inspectors. Support staff must have a representative
     from each key support and inspection organization. (T-3)
     4.2.1.1.6.9. Training. Commanders are responsible for creating and maintaining
     a training program in concert with utilizing the installation TCO's expertise to
     prepare all base players in an OST activity to perform their duties. Not everyone
     is suited to perform escort duties—maturity is a key ingredient in selecting local
     escorts. While no specific certification is required, Commanders must ensure
     mature individuals are selected. Commanders may use exceptional junior
     personnel (E-4 and below) only under exceptional circumstances. Commander
     support in maintaining the required number of trained escorts is very important.
     In most cases, periodic refresher training is desirable and necessary. At other
     times, just-in-time training of local personnel may be all a base can complete due
     to limited availability of personnel. Installations must have a goal of maintaining
     a pool of trained personnel, as continuity promotes a high level of efficiency and
     support for complying with treaty protocols. (T-3)
     4.2.1.1.6.10. Safety/Security Briefing. Upon arrival at a host airfield the TCO
     must present a safety/security briefing to the visiting mission teams. These
     briefings are adapted to the local environment and provide a perspective of the
     base and facilities to be used by the mission teams. The briefing will also cover
     the weather conditions the teams should expect, installation security policies,
     escort procedures and photography policy, and whom to contact if any visitor
AFI16-604 28 MARCH 2012                                                                         33


             needs assistance. These briefings must be developed in advance and coordinated
             with the DTRA Open Skies Division for translation into Russian. NOTE:
             Whatever safety/security rules the TCO levies on the foreign mission teams must
             also be followed by the U.S. mission teams and the local base escorts. Foreign
             Teams may not always abide by our flight line safety rules and procedures, so
             vigilance by the U.S. and installation escorts is mandatory. However, we must
             continue to inform them of our rules and available safety equipment. (T-2)
             4.2.1.1.6.11. Identification of any alleged prohibited activity when the DTRA
             Escort Team and foreign team representatives are at a host airfield during an OST
             mission shall be reported to the DTRA Escort Team Chief immediately. The
             installation TCO shall provide support to the DTRA Escort Team Chief as
             requested to facilitate resolution of any prohibited activity. (T-0)
             4.2.1.1.6.12. Protocol. Protocol activity includes arrangements for distinguished
             visitor (DV), arranging off-base meals, reception and departure functions, closing
             ceremonies, and memento exchanges. Per the Treaty, the foreign OST mission
             team members are afforded diplomatic rights and privileges under the Vienna
             Convention on Diplomatic Relations.
             4.2.1.1.6.13. Cultural Activities. At the DTRA Team Chief’s request, pre-
             coordinate and facilitate leisure activities such as tours, shopping, and recreational
             opportunities. Work with affected services: Transportation, Base Exchange,
             Commissary, Recreational Services, and affected civilian establishments as
             necessary. (T-3)
     4.2.1.2. Reports. Submit reports consistent with the guidance in Chapter 6. (T-3)
     4.2.1.3. Open Skies TCO positions are a scarce manning resource. Frequently ,TCOs
     have a minimally-trained backup, if they have a backup. As such, at installations with an
     Arms Control PE35145F-funded Open Skies TCO, duties not directly related to treaty
     activities will not be assigned by the installation when they directly interfere with TCO
     duties. (T-2)
  4.2.2. Installation Expert. As the installation expert on the OST, TCOs are required to
  perform dynamic, comprehensive analysis of the impact of Open Skies activities on the
  installation, tenant Units, separately located facilities, and associated missions. This requires
  all TCOs have a general knowledge of the OST. In this role, TCOs answer questions
  regarding the OST as well as identify and explain the effect this Treaty will or may have on
  the installation’s military and commercial activities.
     4.2.2.1. The inspection process is associated with the observation aircraft and flight
     operations, but the TCOs are responsible for logistics support to aircraft operations and
     mission teams.
     4.2.2.2. TCOs host observation aircraft for Open Skies missions and training flights.
     This involves coordination from a variety of supporting activities such as: Base Ops,
     weather support, transportation, dining and billeting, force protection, security and
     OPSEC, aircraft services (fuel, water, air, de-icing, lavatory, flight meals, and parking),
     protocol and public affairs, medical and recreational services, meeting/conference rooms
     and communications availability, and escorting.
34                                                                 AFI16-604 28 MARCH 2012


     4.2.2.3. For bases that host aircraft inspection procedures, particular attention must be
     paid to facilitating flight line activities, including photography and access requirements.
     4.2.2.4. TCOs must work closely with their base counterparts to identify possible
     problems and recommend solutions.
     4.2.2.5. Open Skies missions are conducted against a strict timeline directed by the
     Treaty. There is flexibility in the timelines, but TCO inability to facilitate ground support
     actions that cause the mission to deviate from those timelines can result in violations of
     the Treaty and create a diplomatic challenge. OST timelines are identified in OST,
     Article VI.
     4.2.2.6. Routine airfield maintenance, such as runway/taxiway construction and
     renovation or modifications to the navigation aids associated with landing/take-off
     procedures can pose a potential implementation challenge. For instance, if a runway is to
     be closed for a period of time to undergo resurfacing, etc., AF/A5XP must be notified so
     the USG can notify all other Open Skies States Parties of the non-availability of that
     airfield. This requires TCOs maintain a working relationship with installation
     organizations to ensure they are well aware of base projects that may impact Open Skies
     activities. (T-2)
     4.2.2.7. Major installation/community events that could impact Open Skies operations
     must be afforded the same attention. Air shows, marathons, exercises, inspections,
     weather events (e.g., hurricane staging support), etc., may limit ramp space,
     transportation, or billeting availability and can affect the ability to host Open Skies
     activities. Installation TCOs will notify AF/A5XP as soon as possible once they identify
     major installation/community events that could impact Open Skies operations. (T-3)
  4.2.3. Education, Training, and Exercises. Education, training, and exercise activities are
  not expected to be an in-depth study on OST. They must focus on the timeline for the event,
  installation and escort responsibilities, OPSEC, and impacts/vulnerabilities of observation
  collection flights. (T-3)
     4.2.3.1. Installation TCOs develop and maintain installation training programs.
     Information can be obtained from other bases, MAJCOMs, Air Force Office of Special
     Investigations (AFOSI), DTRA, Defense Treaty Inspection Readiness Program (DTIRP),
     and AF/A5XP. TCOs will participate in and conduct training appropriate to their
     responsibility. (T-3)
  4.2.4. Logistics Support
     4.2.4.1. Aircraft Support. TCOs at airfields supporting Open Skies activities will
     facilitate aircraft servicing and maintenance as required and/or as requested by the 55th
     Wing or the DTRA Escort Team Chief. This includes, but is not limited to: refueling,
     gaseous oxygen, nitrogen, de-icing, ground equipment, power carts, air stairs, water,
     latrine servicing, weather support, and flight meals. (T-1)
         4.2.4.1.1. Standard Air Force safety procedures apply for aircraft servicing activities.
         4.2.4.1.2. Bills for fuel and other aircraft services for foreign observation aircraft will
         be submitted to the DTRA Escort Team Chief or financial agent. (T-3)
AFI16-604 28 MARCH 2012                                                                      35


        4.2.4.1.3. U.S. personnel will not enter foreign-owned, operated, or registered aircraft
        without permission from the DTRA Escort Team Chief following consultation with a
        member of the foreign observation team. (T-0)
        4.2.4.1.4. U.S. personnel will not conduct maintenance on foreign-owned, operated,
        or registered aircraft without the express permission of the DTRA Escort Team Chief
        and the Aircraft Commander. (T-0)
     4.2.4.2. In the event the designated OST airfield is unusable for any period of time,
     notify AF/A5XP (through the MAJCOM) of that fact, and coordinate logistics support at
     the nearest commercial airport capable of supporting OST operations. In addition,
     coordinate with DTRA as appropriate to facilitate OST operations at an alternate airport
     in the vicinity. (T-2)
        4.2.4.2.1. If the alternate airport is reasonably close to, and accessible from, the
        designated OST airfield, the TCO must make every effort to support the OST activity
        with organic support and services. If the alternate airfield is outside that area or the
        installation is unable to support OST activities at the alternate airfield, the TCO will
        attempt to assist the DTRA Escort Team in facilitating airfield logistics support. (T-2)
 36                                                            AFI16-604 28 MARCH 2012


                                         Chapter 5

                 MISSION TASKING, PLANNING, AND EXECUTION

5.1. Mission Tasking
   5.1.1. Active and passive mission quotas are determined and deconflicted in accordance with
   the OST. AOMs are determined by the governing NSPD and the USG Interagency; tasked
   by OSD(Policy) and SECDEF/CJCS EXORDS, and IMPORDS; and flown to fulfill national
   collection objectives generated by USG entities. The NGA is responsible for collection
   objectives. JTFs with partner country participants are approved by both the USG Interagency
   Backstopping Group and the DoD OSIWG. JTFs are tasked by OUSD(AT&L)/PSA/TC.
   OCONUS JTF’s are included in SECDEF/CJCS IMPORDS. U.S.-only training flights in the
   CONUS are coordinated between DTRA and the Air Force and are approved by the OSIWG.
      5.1.1.1. The schedule approved by the USG Interagency and OSIWG constitutes tasking
      to support the Open Skies schedule. The schedule forwarded from AF/A5XP to the Air
      Force MAJCOMs and other affected agencies/offices constitutes tasking to Air Force
      components to support the USG Open Skies schedule. In addition, any OCONUS
      activities are tasked by SECDEF/CJCS IMPORDS.
      5.1.1.2. AOM scheduling is determined by time of year and areas of interest, is
      deconflicted with allies who also want observation quotas over the same State Party, is
      approved by the USG Interagency Backstopping Group, is tasked by OSD(Policy), and is
      further tasked by SECDEF/CJCS IMPORDS.
          5.1.1.2.1. SECDEF, through CJCS, tasks the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) to
          deploy the U.S. Open Skies aircraft to the EUCOM AOR to conduct Treaty-quota
          AOMs and OCONUS JTFs via quarterly IMPORDS. TRANSCOM and PACOM are
          tasked to support the deployments, as required.
          5.1.1.2.2. Commander, ACC deploys the U.S. Open Skies aircraft via follow-on
          DEPORD. Note: Per AFI 10-401, Commander, ACC, is authorized to deploy assets
          to meet OST requirements.
          5.1.1.2.3. ACC tasks the 55th Wing (55WG) to support the Open Skies deployment
          with dedicated organic assets, including an OC-135B Open Skies aircraft, air and
          maintenance crews, and Aeronautical Systems Engineers (ASE)/ Sensor Maintenance
          Technicians (SMTs).
          5.1.1.2.4. The 55th Wing tasks the 55th Operations Group, who in turn tasks the 45th
          Reconnaissance Squadron (45RS) to deploy assets to support the Open Skies tasking.
      5.1.1.3. JTFs are approved by the USG Interagency Backstopping Group and
      deconflicted by the OSIWG.
          5.1.1.3.1. OUSD(AT&L)/PSA/TC, Chair of the OSIWG, then distributes the JTF
          schedule to OSIWG members for approval.
             5.1.1.3.1.1. For OCONUS JTFs in the U.S. Open Skies aircraft, the aircraft
             deployment is tasked via IMPORD/DEPORD following procedures similar to
             taskings for AOMs.
AFI16-604 28 MARCH 2012                                                                        37


             5.1.1.3.1.2. For CONUS JTFs in the U.S. Open Skies aircraft, the events are
             reflected on the schedule distributed by the OSIWG and forwarded to ACC by
             AF/A5XP.
      5.1.1.4. U.S.-only training activities (e.g., Blue-on-Blue flights) are coordinated with and
      approved by the OSIWG, and reflected in the schedule distributed by the OSIWG. This
      schedule is forwarded by AF/A5XP to affected Air Force MAJCOMs and other affected
      agencies/offices.
      5.1.1.5. AF/A5XP represents Air Force equities and interests at the OSIWG. The
      OSMPF and MAJCOMs make inputs into the OSIWG process thru AF/A5XP. ACC will
      make AF/A5XP aware of any/all issues associated with aircraft and crew availability in
      order to avoid tasking those assets when not available. If ACC cannot support a tasked
      activity, they must provide rationale to AF/A5XP as soon as practical, with an estimate of
      next availability.
5.2. Mission Planning
   5.2.1. A Mission Planning Cell (MPC) consisting of representatives from NGA, DTRA/OP-
   OSO, and 45RS will develop mission plans for all tasked missions a minimum of three (3)
   weeks prior to any tasked mission. The MPC will submit completed mission plans to the
   OSIWG no later than 14 days prior to the planned aircraft movement for a tasked mission.
      5.2.1.1. For active missions, general responsibilities are as follows:
          5.2.1.1.1. NGA chairs the MPC, provides collection objectives, and certifies the
          mission plan meets collection objectives.
          5.2.1.1.2. DTRA provides Treaty expertise and certifies the mission plan meets
          Treaty guidelines.
          5.2.1.1.3. 45RS representatives provide aviation expertise and certify the mission
          plan is flyable and OC-135B safety of flight and operating parameters are met. If
          required, the 45RS will request operating waivers, with justification, from the
          appropriate authority. When aircraft is operating in the EUCOM AOR, the 45RS or
          the 95RS will request and obtain OG/CC operating waiver approval when required,
          through 100 OG/CC.
   5.2.2. Mission planning for overseas Open Skies missions will be conducted at DTRA
   headquarters at Fort Belvoir, VA.
      5.2.2.1. For CONUS JTF missions, planning may be scheduled at the beginning of the
      JTF mission.
   5.2.3. All mission planning and execution will be done based on a 16-hour crew day. (T-2)
      5.2.3.1. If the flight crew is augmented, this will be for duty not involving flying (DNIF)
      coverage only and will not extend the crew duty day. (T-3)
   5.2.4. Missions will be planned to provide 12 hours of crew rest between the last official
   duty of the previous duty period and the first official duty of the subsequent flight duty
   period. (T-2)
 38                                                                AFI16-604 28 MARCH 2012


   5.2.5. DTRA/OP-OSO will distribute a Deployment Memorandum (DM) as soon as possible
   following each MPC, identifying parameters of the event, timeline/itinerary, and names of
   individuals involved. 45RS and the OSMPF are responsible for providing names of their
   personnel involved in the activity to DTRA at the MPC or as soon as practicable. (T-2)
   5.2.6. Mission plans for other tasked missions will be developed on an ad hoc basis and
   submitted as soon as practicable.
   5.2.7. All passport and visa requirements for 55WG personnel will be coordinated directly
   with DTRA/OP-OSAX. DTRA/OP-OSAX will track and submit required forms for final
   processing. (T-3)
5.3. Mission Execution
   5.3.1. The DTRA Team Chief is the Mission Commander and senior USG representative
   responsible for the conduct of the observation mission itself.

   the operation of the U.S. Open Skies aircraft. (T-1)
   5.3.3. Mission execution will be coordinated between the DTRA Mission Commander and
   the Aircraft Commander. (T-2)
      5.3.3.1. All issues related to the aircraft and aircraft safety will be brought to the Mission
      Commander’s attention via the Aircraft Commander. (T-3)
      5.3.3.2. The Aircraft Commander is responsible for aircrew and aircraft operations, flight
      safety, and keeping the Mission Commander informed. (T-1)
      5.3.3.3. The Maintenance Supervisor is responsible for the maintenance team and all
      aircraft maintenance issues and shall keep both the Aircraft Commander and Mission
      Commander informed. (T-2)
      5.3.3.4. The Production Supervisor will report to the Aircraft Commander for all
      administrative and operational matters. (T-3)
   5.3.4. All fees associated with a Treaty-quota AOM will be paid in accordance with OSCC
   Decision 01. (T-0)
      5.3.4.1. “Fees shall not be charged either to a transiting State Party or to an observing
      State Party for the use of navigational aids and for air traffic control services, airport
      landing, takeoff, ground handling, parking and security for all Open Skies transit,
      transport, and observation flights.” (OSCC Decision 01)
5.4. Aircraft Commander Responsibilities
   5.4.1. The Aircraft Commander:
      5.4.1.1. Is responsible for safe conduct of the flight mission. (T-1)
      5.4.1.2. Coordinates with the Mission Commander to ensure U.S. observation mission
      plans are executable, do not compromise safety of flight, and are not hindered by safety
      of flight restrictions. (T-2)
          5.4.1.2.1. The final decision to delay a mission, when conditions are not safe to
          start/continue the mission, will be made by the Aircraft Commander. (T-1)
AFI16-604 28 MARCH 2012                                                                        39


      5.4.1.3. Will ensure all observation team representatives are briefed on safety
      precautions prior to preflight inspection of the aircraft/sensors and prior to observation
      missions. (T-2)
      5.4.1.4. Will observe national flight rules and airspace restrictions of the observed State
      Party and of any transited states. (T-1)
          5.4.1.4.1. If flight plan deviations are required, the Aircraft Commander will
          coordinate with the Mission Commander prior to deviating (if possible) and take
          appropriate action in accordance with published observed Party national flight
          regulations and instructions from appropriate aviation authorities. (T-2)
      5.4.1.5. Will provide the Mission Commander timely information on mission progress.
      (T-3)
      5.4.1.6. Will comply with the flight operations manual and Procedures for Air
      Navigation Services - Rules of the Air and Air Traffic Services, ICAO Document No.
      4444-RAC/50/12, as revised or amended. (T-1)
5.5. Aircrew Management
   5.5.1. Flight Duty Period (FDP)
      5.5.1.1. The FDP is defined by AFI 11-202 Volume 3 (Including ACC Supplements) and
      AFI 11-2RC-135 Volume 3.
      5.5.1.2. Due to the unique nature and political sensitivity of Open Skies Treaty missions,
      the flight duty period for Active Missions will begin at the transportation show time
      commencing that day’s FDP. (T-2)
   5.5.2. Crew Rest
      5.5.2.1. Crew rest is defined by AFI 11-202 Volume 3 (Including ACC Supplements),
      Flying Operations: General Flight Rules, and AFI 11-2RC-135 Volume 3, Flying
      Operations: RC/OC/WC/TC-135 Operations Procedures.
      5.5.2.2. Due to the unique nature and political sensitivity of Open Skies Treaty missions,
      crew rest for OC-135B aircrews will not begin until the completion of the last official
      duty event, to include transportation from the event to aircrew lodging. (T-2)
5.6. Aircrew Training and Qualifications
   5.6.1. The U.S. Open Skies mission involves operating specially-equipped U.S. Air Force
   OC-135B aircraft on observation flights over foreign countries, primarily the Russian
   Federation, Belarus, and Ukraine. Observation missions may entail low-altitude flights in
   austere locations with limited infrastructure support and diplomatically-sensitive
   environments with a degree of mission uncertainty. Aircrews and maintenance crews must
   be appropriately trained and certified for these challenging and highly visible missions. (T-1)
   5.6.2. Aircraft Commanders will not be mission qualified for Open Skies deployments until
   they have participated in at least two Open Skies missions. An Aircraft Commander on a
   second Open Skies mission may be the pilot-in-command if accompanied by a qualified
   Open Skies Aircraft Commander. (T-2)
 40                                                             AFI16-604 28 MARCH 2012


   5.6.3. Basic OC-135B aircrew training, evaluation criteria, and operations procedures are
   listed in AFIs 11-2RC-135, Volumes 1 Flying Operations: RC/OC/WC/TC-135 Aircrew

5.7. Aircraft and Sensor Maintenance
   5.7.1. The OC-135B must be capable of operating independently of unique support
   equipment for periods of approximately two weeks. (T-2)
      5.7.1.1. Logistics support during an Open Skies mission will primarily consist of
      organizational-level maintenance provided by dedicated crew chief(s) and additional
      aircraft and sensor maintenance personnel aboard the aircraft.
      5.7.1.2. Maintenance planning and scheduling for organizational, intermediate, and
      depot-level maintenance of on-equipment and off-equipment sustainment activities will
      be coordinated through HQ ACC functional managers and managed by HQ AFMC. (T-2)
      5.7.1.3. Specific maintenance crew requirements for deployment will be determined by
      the 55WG. (T-3)
   5.7.2. Mission Suite Maintenance
      5.7.2.1. Prior to deployment for an AOM, the Sensor Maintenance Technicians (SMT)
      will verify the proper configuration and operation of the mission equipment including the
      sensors’ data annotation and recording system, the sensor control stations, and the main
      and spare mission equipment feeds. They will also confirm the sensor covers are firmly
      attached prior to take-off, as required. (T-2)
      5.7.2.2. If any item of equipment had been replaced, modified, or upgraded prior to use
      on an AOM, it may require operational testing to ensure it is functioning as designed and
      advertised to partner countries.
          5.7.2.2.1. Any sensor that requires confirmation that modifications, maintenance, or
          upgrades did not affect the certified altitude above ground to which the sensor can
          achieve no better than Treaty allowed resolution (Hmin) must be tested over an
          approved target at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH. (T-1)
          5.7.2.2.2. Any item of mission equipment that requires confirmation that
          maintenance did not affect the operation of that equipment, by collection of sample
          imagery, must be tested in accordance with AFI 14-104, Oversight of Intelligence
          Activities, to ensure compliance with domestic imagery collection regulations. (T-0)
          Coordination between the NASIC OSMPF and ACC/A2XX is necessary to obtain the
          required Proper Use Memorandum (PUM) IAW AFI 14-104 and DOD 5240.1-R,

                COMMUNICATIONS, NOTIFICATIONS, AND REPORTS

6.1. General. This section details communication and notification responsibilities for
compliance with the OST. Voice, fax, and electronic notification reports will be passed to Units
to alert them of impending overflight events and mission status. Notifications include: intent to
conduct an observation; arrivals at and departures from POEs/POXs, OSAs, and OSRAs;
proposed/approved mission plans; delay/termination of observation flights; and other
miscellaneous reports.
   6.1.1. Notifications associated with Passive Observation Missions are identified in the
   OSIWG SOP 05-01: Open Skies Passive Notification Procedures and in SOP 05-03: Open
   Skies Training Coordination Process and Notification Procedures for Training Flights over
   the United States. Contact the AF/A5XP POC (usaf.pentagon.af-a3-5.mbx.open-
   skies@mail.mil) for copies.
6.2. Types of Notifications. The following paragraphs address the notification processes in
CONUS, Alaska, and Hawaii. Note: The notification process in Europe is very different and is
detailed in the HQ USAFE Open Skies Compliance Plan.
   6.2.1. Voice Format (VF) Notifications. Open Skies VF notifications are transmitted from
   the DTRA Operations Center to the Headquarters Air Force Operations Center. From the AF
   Operations Center they are automatically distributed to the Air Force MAJCOM Operations
   Centers/Command Posts and additional offices, including AF/A5XP. MAJCOMs then re-
   distribute these VF notifications to their Units, tenant organizations, and TCOs.
       6.2.1.1. The following is a list of current OST VF Notifications:
                VF#1: Notification of Intent to conduct an Observation Flight over the U.S.
                (Inside the U.S.)

                VF#2: Notification of Intent to Conduct an Observation Flight (Outside the
                U.S.)

                VF#5: Observing Party’s Initial Arrival at the POE

                VF#6: Departure of Observation Teams from the POE for the OSA

                VF#7: Arrival of Observation Teams at OSA

                VF#8: Completion of Pre-flight Inspection

                VF#9: Completion of Demonstration Flight

                VF#12: Observation Aircraft Take-off

                VF#13: Observation Aircraft Landing

                VF#15: Observation Team Departure from the OSA for the POX

                VF#16: Observation Team Arrival at POX from the OSA

                VF#17: Observation Party’s Final Departure from the POX

                VF#19: Miscellaneous Report
   6.2.2. Telephone Notification System (TNS).
       6.2.2.1. DTRA is tasked with making early notification of Open Skies missions over the
       U.S to USG Departments/Agencies, the FAA, and related industry sites/facilities
       throughout the U.S. To accomplish this, DTRA developed two computer systems: the
       Passive Overflight Module (POM) and the TNS. Both systems are a part of the Open
       Skies Management and Planning System (OSMAPS) which provides DTRA with
       computerized mission analysis, planning, flight following, and assessment capabilities.
           6.2.2.1.1. The POM performs analysis of Open Skies overflight by foreign observers.
           It generates notification messages to sites requesting overflight information.
           Messages are sent using the TNS.
           6.2.2.1.2. The POM/TNS is an automated notification system, utilizing both
           telephone and facsimile networks, providing timely OST information to a designated
           list of sites. All USAF components should take advantage of the POM/TNS.
              6.2.2.1.2.1. There are two distribution lists associated with the POM: Standard
              Call List and Affected Call List.
                  6.2.2.1.2.1.1. The Standard Call List includes telephone and fax numbers of
                  Service and MAJCOM Headquarters and others as requested.
                  6.2.2.1.2.1.2. The Affected Call List includes telephone and/or fax numbers
                  of those locations in the direct path of an expected observation overflight in
                  addition to those on the Standard Call List.
              6.2.2.1.2.2. Units not receiving POM/TNS notifications that wish to be added to
              the distribution lists, or desire a change, should contact AF/A5XP
              (usaf.pentagon.af-a3-5.mbx.open-skies@mail.mil or DSN (312) 224-0676).
   6.2.3. Electronic Notifications. At this time, these are informal notifications from DTRA.
       6.2.3.1. AF/A5XP retransmits these electronic notifications to a wide distribution list.
       This distribution is a back-up to the official notification process. Units that wish to be
       added to this distribution list should contact AF/A5XP (usaf.pentagon.af-a3-
       5.mbx.open-skies@mail.mil) or DSN (312) 224-0676.
6.3. High Value Activity (HVA) Reporting. The following paragraphs address the HVA
reporting processes in CONUS, Alaska, and Hawaii. Note: Commands in Europe have little
opportunity to impact overflight of host nations but can affect U.S. activities that could impact
AFI16-604 28 MARCH 2012                                                                             43


the overflight or be impacted by the overflight. The process for reporting significant events in
Europe and for protecting U.S. activities from any adverse impact of the OST overflight is
detailed in the HQ USAFE Open Skies Compliance Plan.
   6.3.1. Upon Receipt of a Notification of Intent to Conduct an Observation Flight over the
   U.S. (VF#1), MAJCOMs will initiate the collection of HVA from their subordinate/tenant
   Units/facilities to determine any activities within their purview that could impact or be
   impacted by an observation overflight. MAJCOMs will report their HVA, or a Negative
   Report, to AF/A5XP at DSN (312) 224-0676, Commercial (703) 614-0676,
   usaf.pentagon.af-a3-5.mbx.open-skies@mail.mil or open.skies@af.pentagon.smil.mil as
   soon as possible after receipt of a VF#1, but no later than 48 hours after its receipt.
   AF/A5XP must deliver these HVA Reports to the DOD HVA Group (HVAG) no later than
   24 hours prior to arrival of the observation aircraft at the designated POE.
       6.3.1.1. The HVAG (reference Paragraph 3.1.5.) receives submissions of HVA Reports
       from the Services and DoD Agencies and provides guidance to the DTRA U.S. Escort
       Team with respect to mission plan negotiations. If an Observing Party’s proposed
       mission plan is impacted by an identified HVA, or if an HVA impacts the flight, the U.S.
       Escort Team may receive guidance to attempt to negotiate with the Observing Party to
       adjust the flight route to avoid the HVA.
       6.3.1.2. HVA procedures are detailed in OSIWG SOP 05-02: High Value Activities
       (HVA) Notification Procedures. Contact AF/A5XP (usaf.pentagon.af-a3-5.mbx.open-
       skies@mail.mil) for the SOP and the HVA report format template.
   6.3.2. In general, an HVA is an activity that:
       6.3.2.1. Will incur substantial monetary cost if postponed or cancelled,
       6.3.2.2. Cannot be concealed and reveals national security information if observed,
       6.3.2.3. Takes advantage of a unique set of chronological or meteorological
       circumstances which cannot be duplicated, or
       6.3.2.4. The command/agency believes special circumstances apply.
   6.3.3. The criteria for an HVA are dynamic and subject to change and interpretation.
   Typical examples of HVA that might be reported by the Air Force include space/missile
   launches. Other examples of HVA that may be reported are weapons movements, operations
   or major exercises, and equipment testing.
       6.3.3.1. It is the responsibility of the reporting installation to report those events they feel
       may meet the requirements of an HVA. It is also their responsibility to protect their
       HVA from observation, as they would from satellite vulnerability. Various protective
       measures are available, such as: cancelling or postponing the HVA, shrouding or moving
       the sensitive equipment indoors during the period of vulnerability, or relocating the
       sensitive equipment to another location that may not be vulnerable to observation. Note:
       When an observation aircraft is eventually fielded with infrared (IR) sensors and
       synthetic aperture radars (SAR), these protective measures may be more challenging and
       complicated.
       6.3.3.2. AF/A5XP is responsible for evaluating Air Force HVA Reports and for
       presenting them to the DoD HVAG. Subsequently, the Treaty Manager will give
 44                                                                AFI16-604 28 MARCH 2012


      guidance to the DTRA Escort Team Chief in the event the proposed observation flight
      impacts an HVA.
   6.3.4. Before reporting an HVA, installation personnel and MAJCOMs need to evaluate the
   following:
      6.3.4.1. Can the activity be deconflicted with the observation overflight window of
      vulnerability?
      6.3.4.2. Can the activity be delayed?
      6.3.4.3. What is the cost to cancel or delay the activity?
   6.3.5. With each HVA Report, the installation and the MAJCOM must indicate their
   recommendations associated with this HVA.
      6.3.5.1. If the HVA can be deconflicted, the recommendation would likely be to report
      the HVA for information only.
      6.3.5.2. If the installation’s preference is relief from the observing Party, the installation
      TCO, through the MAJCOM TCO, will provide recommendations for the negotiating
      guidance that will be given to the DTRA Escort Team Chief. (T-2)
      6.3.5.3. If the recommendation is to avoid the HVA, then the reporting installation will
      provide the name and immediate contact information for the senior flag officer
      supporting the HVA. This recommendation may be viewed by treaty partners as an
      infringement of their treaty rights. This scenario is serious and will generate guidance
      from the HVAG or higher. (T-2)
   6.3.6. The OST contains criteria for mission flight route negotiations and flight route
   changes. For further information see: OST Article VI, Section II, paragraphs 2, 4, and 6;
   and Article VIII, Section I, paragraphs 4 and 5.
6.4. Treaty Compliance Officer (TCO) Reports
   6.4.1. If requested by the DTRA Escort Team Chief, the TCO will make aircraft departure
   reports to the DTRA Operations Center as soon as practical after the observation aircraft
   takes off. (T-3)
   6.4.2. The TCO will pass After Action Reports (AAR) to the MAJCOM following any OST
   observation activity that the installation hosts. The MAJCOM will pass these AARs to
   AF/A5XP. (T-3)
   6.4.3. TCOs will report security incidents, such as unauthorized photography, to the local
   AFOSI/security forces, their MAJCOM, and the DTRA Escort Team Chief. These incidents
   will be reflected in any AARs. (T-2)
AFI16-604 28 MARCH 2012                                                                         45


                                           Chapter 7

                                     MISCELLANEOUS

7.1. Financial Management (FM)
   7.1.1. Funding. AF/A5XP is the Air Force PEM for all USAF arms control treaties and
   agreements’ related costs, including Open Skies. The Arms Control PE is 35145F.
      7.1.1.1. Observation aircraft expenses to include maintenance, operations, and flying
      hours are funded thru PE 35145F.
      7.1.1.2. Periodic depot maintenance, technical order updates, and engineering
      sustainment costs are typically 3400 money and are programmed by AFMC.
      7.1.1.3. Programming for modification of the OC-135B airframe using appropriation
      3010 depends on who “owns” the requirement. ACC may program for an OC-135B-only
      modification and program for those modification funds separately. Typically, the
      modification takes place at the AFMC depot/modification center and the customer will
      request the modification be made to accommodate modernization to the mission
      equipment. ACC and AFMC must remain vigilant to the modification requirements and
      program accordingly.
      7.1.1.4. The flying Unit’s Open Skies manpower authorizations are also funded from the
      Arms Control PE.
      7.1.1.5. Infrastructure-related costs to support Treaty Compliance Offices and the
      OSMPF, including associated manpower, are funded thru PE 35145F.
   7.1.2. MAJCOM Treaty Officers submit annual requests for funding under the Arms Control
   PE in accordance with instructions provided separately.
      7.1.2.1. ACC: Budget for and reimburse DTRA for aircraft and aircrew-related expenses
      the DTRA mission team pays for during an AOM. Note: During AOM’s all mission-
      related expenses (accommodations and meals for the entire deployed crew, fuel, and
      aircraft services) are paid by DTRA.
7.2. Manpower, Personnel, and Training
   7.2.1. Working through the AF Corporate Structure, AF/A5XP in conjunction with AF/A1M
   determines and allocates manpower resources to MAJCOMs to support AF implementation
   of, and compliance with, arms control treaties and agreements.
   7.2.2. In accordance with AFI 16-601, all MAJCOMs will establish an office of primary
   responsibility and specific points of contact for arms control.
   7.2.3. HQ ACC maintains responsibility for manpower associated with the flying Unit
   supporting the observation aircraft to include filling all authorized billets and the
   qualifications of flying personnel. Of primary concern is the consistent availability of trained
   and qualified air and maintenance crews who are deployable to support all OST tasked
   missions.
   7.2.4. HQ AFISRA/NASIC maintains responsibility for manpower associated with the
   OSMPF, including fulfillment of all authorized billets. Of primary concern is the capability
 46                                                               AFI16-604 28 MARCH 2012


   to support the processing of media products from both U.S. and foreign OST missions,
   including the capability to handle materials used in processing of products. Members of the
   OSMPF must be deployable for OST activities overseas.
   7.2.5. All personnel having OST responsibilities must take advantage of appropriate training
   opportunities (DTRA training courses, Air Force workshops, etc.). In addition, host
   installations must maintain a cadre of trained escorts to support incoming foreign OST teams.
   (T-2)
7.3. Legal
   7.3.1. SAF/GCI will provide legal support on matters involving the interpretation and
   implementation of the OST. The servicing Staff Judge Advocate to the Combatant
   Commander or its Air Component will provide legal advice on questions arising from
   mission planning and operations management and the review of any related documents.
7.4. Observation Team Arrival Procedures
   7.4.1. The Wing Commander, or designated representative, will meet the visiting team upon
   arrival of an observation aircraft to a host installation. (T-3) Particular attention should be
   paid to foreign aircraft/team members.
   7.4.2. Notification of the incoming team will list the manifest of personnel, including
   positions within the team and the last six digits of the Social Security numbers for all U.S.
   personnel. The DTRA Escort Team Chief and the foreign Team Chief(s) should be readily
   identifiable by their name tags.
   7.4.3. The observation aircraft must be parked in an area close to Base Operations, in a
   hangar (if weather prevents required aircraft maintenance outdoors), or at another location as
   dictated by the security situation. The aircraft must be positioned in such a way to allow
   start-up and taxi to the runway without towing. (T-3)
      7.4.3.1. Towing of the foreign observation aircraft is discouraged unless absolutely
      necessary for security or maintenance. Towing or hangaring the foreign aircraft should
      be conducted as a last resort and only if requested by the foreign Team Chief. If
      required, and appropriate support equipment is available, the foreign maintenance
      personnel should complete the task using their personnel.
   7.4.4. Local base escorts and appropriate security forces, if necessary, will be immediately
   available to support the arriving teams. Provisions must be made to expedite transportation
   of personnel to the next event (Welcome/Arrival briefings, billeting, etc.), and movement of
   luggage/gear from the aircraft to the appropriate location. (T-3)
   7.4.5. The host installation TCO will present an arrival and local safety briefing as soon as
   practicable after arrival of the observation teams. These briefings will be pre-coordinated
   with DTRA because of the requirement for translation. (T-2)
7.5. Defector Procedures
   7.5.1. If any foreign OST team member indicates their desire to defect to an Air Force
   representative, the escort will immediately inform the DTRA Team Chief. The DTRA Team
   Chief, as the senior U.S. Government representative, will take actions as appropriate. (T-2)
AFI16-604 28 MARCH 2012                                                                       47


       7.5.1.1. If the indication happens when on U.S. soil (or on a U.S. base in a host nation),
       the Air Force hosting unit will take no actions unless requested by the DTRA Escort
       Team Chief. If the DTRA Escort Team Chief requests assistance, the TCO will
       immediately inform installation leadership, base security, and the local AFOSI
       representative. (T-2)
       7.5.1.2. If the indication happens outside of the U.S. while onboard the U.S. observation
       aircraft, the DTRA Team Chief will be notified immediately and will take full
       responsibility for follow-on actions. When appropriate, and as soon as possible, situation
       reports will be made to the OPCON Commander.
7.6. Public Affairs (PA)
   7.6.1. In accordance with standing OASD(PA) guidance, the DoD PA posture is: response to
   inquiry only.
   7.6.2. Hosting units will accommodate media coverage of Open Skies activities IAW DOD
   "Principles of Information," SAF/PA, DTRA/PA, OASD(PA), and installation PA guidance.
   Requests by news media to cover these activities will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
   (T-3)
       7.6.2.1. Unit PA offices will comply with established higher-level PA guidance (T-0),
       and will develop an internal information plan to accommodate this guidance. (T-3)
       7.6.2.2. Local media interest may be accommodated on a not-to-interfere basis with
       Open Skies activities, and only with the DTRA Escort Team Chief’s concurrence.
       7.6.2.3. The installation PA office will keep the community aware of OST activities via
       routine meetings between key civic leaders and base officials. (T-3)
       7.6.2.4. Prepared news releases will be used whenever possible using coordinated and
       approved language from PA guidance for Open Skies treaty authored by DTRA. (T-3)
   7.6.3. The Defense Media Activity will coordinate all Armed Forces Radio and Television
   Service support activities to ensure continuity.
   7.6.4. In the event of a defection or death of a foreign Open Skies team member, all queries
   will be referred to the Department of State. No local comments, confirmations, etc., will be
   made. (T-2)
7.7. Protocol
   7.7.1. Hosting foreign OST observation missions is a national, legal obligation. The foreign
   team must be afforded the opportunity to exercise their rights under the OST. The host
   installations must facilitate the conduct of the event. (T-1)
   7.7.2. Reception of the visiting OST teams must be polite, courteous, and accommodating.
   7.7.3. Observation team members typically travel under Diplomatic passports. In any event,
   observation team members must be accorded the rights, privileges, and immunities outlined
   in the OST, Article XIII, and in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 18 April
   1961. (T-0)
 48                                                                AFI16-604 28 MARCH 2012


   7.7.4. In the event a dignitary, VIP, or flag officer accompanies the observation activity,
   appropriate protocol accommodations must be afforded them. Coordinate these procedures
   with the DTRA Escort Team Chief. (T-3)
   7.7.5. Nearly all OST activities include a formal dinner or function outside of Treaty
   requirements. These will be coordinated by the TCO and the host Unit Protocol Office.
   Appropriate host installation representation, at a level commensurate with the visibility of the
   activity, must be provided. These events will not be open to the media. (T-3)
       7.7.5.1. Gifts and/or mementoes, if exchanged at these events, should be purchased and
       accounted for using Official Representation Funds (ORF) and identified in the
       installation’s annual budget submission in coordination with the Wing/Unit Commander.
       ORF expenditures must adhere to AFI 65-603.
       7.7.5.2. Escort personnel on a meal card must follow guidance in the Air Force Manual
       65-116. Meals consumed by Treaty escorts while TDY are already covered by per diem
       entitlement. Local escort personnel who are required to consume meals with OST team
       will be reimbursed as per the Defense Travel System Joint Travel Regulation. (T-0)
       7.7.5.3. Authorized local travel will be reimbursed IAW Wing/Unit local travel
       instructions. (T-3)
7.8. Installation Local Activities
   7.8.1. Units hosting OST activities may be called upon to support or facilitate leisure time
   activities for members of the observation teams during periods when they are not required to
   support OST functions. Creativity, ingenuity, and flexibility on the part of the TCO are
   encouraged. Leisure activities are part of hosting, particularly if there are significant delays
   in resuming a mission due to aircraft repairs, weather constraints, etc.
   7.8.2. On-base activities may include, but are not limited to, visits to the Base Exchange
   and/or Commissary, Class Six store, clothing sales, Officer and/or Enlisted Clubs, cafeterias
   and fast-food establishments, museums or displays, athletic center, or other recreational
   facilities. If the Base Exchange and/or Commissary are visited, the TCO will be responsible
   for crowd control and will coordinate with the facility manager to provide a separate check-
   out lane. If requested, cash register tapes/receipts for foreign OST team members will be
   provided to a DTRA escort. (T-3)
       7.8.2.1. As guests of the U.S., observation team members will be authorized the use of
       the Base Exchange and Commissary, Class Six store, convenience stores, and Officer
       and/or Enlisted Clubs. At the clothing sales store, only non-military-issue clothing/items
       may be purchased. The host installation TCO will notify any of these facilities prior to
       the arrival of the observation team. (T-3)
       7.8.2.2. For bases outside the U.S., access to these facilities will be in accordance with
       host nation rules, regulations, and standing Status of Forces Agreements (SOFA). (T-0)
   7.8.3. Off-base activities include shopping, tourist and recreational activities, etc. Any off-
   base activity, including when the teams are housed off-base, will require notification to
   AFOSI and base security to ensure appropriate coordination with local, state, or federal
   authorities. (T-2) Off-base security falls under the jurisdiction of the local, state, or federal
   authorities and will not be provided by base security forces. (T-0)
AFI16-604 28 MARCH 2012                                                                          49


       7.8.3.1. The DTRA Escort Team has sole responsibility for all visiting OST personnel
       during on- and off-base activities.
       7.8.3.2. If requested by the DTRA Escort Team Chief, the TCO may provide, as
       available, local base escorts and drivers to facilitate movement off-base. This does not
       relieve the base of the responsibility to provide transportation for the observation teams,
       but allows them flexibility if the DTRA Escort Team Chief does not require this type of
       assistance.
7.9. Installation Escort Procedures
   7.9.1. Local escorts are required to assist the DTRA Escort Team and to facilitate OST
   activities/events when foreign observation teams and/or aircraft and crews are operating from
   their installation.
   7.9.2. Local escorts are site-knowledgeable base representatives designated as points of
   contact for the DTRA Escort Team. They will be in the grades of E-4 and above and will be
   supervised by senior NCOs (E-7 or above), officers, or civilians. While no specific
   certification is required, Commanders must select mature individuals. (T-3)
   7.9.3. Host units will provide local escorts to support OST activities/events as follows:
       7.9.3.1. Wing Commanders at U.S. Air Force bases hosting OST activities/events will
       assign local escorts to assist the TCO and DTRA Escort and foreign observation teams in
       their movement on and off the property under the responsibility of the Wing Commander.
       (T-2)
       7.9.3.2. Local escorts will report to the TCO and be relieved of all other assigned
       responsibilities while performing escort duties associated with OST activities/events.
       Units will have a qualified medical escort assigned throughout the OST activity. (T-2)
       7.9.3.3. The TCO will maintain a current list of local escorts, and designate and train
       replacements as necessary to ensure continuous availability of escorts for short-notice
       OST activities. (T-2)
       7.9.3.4. Local escorts must have, as a minimum, a Secret security clearance and access to
       restricted areas where OS aircraft may be parked. A sufficient number of local escorts
       must have restricted-area (i.e., flight line, etc.) driving privileges. (T-2)
       7.9.3.5. Local escorts are not expected to be trained as security specialists; however, they
       will be trained to recognize and react to anticipated elicitation and human intelligence
       (HUMINT) gathering techniques. OPSEC procedures still apply. (T-3)
       7.9.3.6. Local escorts are not expected to be conversant about OST information, U.S.
       Government policies concerning OST issues, or the conduct of OST activities at other
       USAF OST airfields.
       7.9.3.7. Local escorts have two responsibilities while on base: (1) the protection and
       safety of visiting OST personnel, and (2) the security of site facilities. Local escorts must
       limit access of personnel not needed to support the OST mission from areas supporting
       OST activities/events. (T-3)
 50                                                                  AFI16-604 28 MARCH 2012


      7.9.3.8. Local escorts will wear visible, distinctive badges when in the company of
      visiting OST personnel. These badges are for identification as treaty escorts only, and
      shall not include the escort’s name. (T-3)
      7.9.3.9. Local escorts/drivers will never be left alone with foreign OST personnel. (T-3)
      7.9.3.10. Local escorts will not accept DTRA Escort responsibilities. (T-3)
      7.9.3.11. Local escorts shall be knowledgeable enough to facilitate movement of the
      visiting OST teams to and from scheduled activities, the flight line, medical facilities,
      dining facilities, billeting, and to on- and off-base shopping locations. (T-3)
      7.9.3.12. Local escorts will be knowledgeable in base security procedures, access
      requirements to the base, and flight line. (T-3)
      7.9.3.13. Local escorts must be flexible and patient, as plans often change. They will
      have constant communications capability with the TCO to report unexpected situations
      and to seek guidance. (T-3)
      7.9.3.14. Local escorts may volunteer for off base/cultural events if requested by the
      DTRA Escort Team Chief and approved by the installation TCO.
7.10. Medical and Dental Support / Mortuary Services
   7.10.1. Host installations are expected to provide or arrange for emergency/non-elective
   medical/dental care as necessary and as requested by the DTRA Escort Team Chief. Medical
   support may be required to enable team members to accomplish their duties, save lives or
   stabilize injuries. Military treatment facilities will be used to the maximum extent possible
   unless the severity of the illness/injury and/or military medical authorities deem otherwise.
   (T-2)
   7.10.2. If transportation to a local civilian medical facility is required, the host installation’s
   medical escort will accompany the member and the DTRA Escort and will stay with them at
   the local facility until care is rendered. The military medical staff will coordinate care with
   the civilian facility as required. The DTRA Escort Team Chief will be kept apprised of the
   patient’s condition and treatment at all times. (T-2)
   7.10.3. If the member requiring medical/dental care is an aircrew member, the host
   installation’s Flight Surgeon’s office will be notified. (T-2)
   7.10.4. Transportation to an appropriate POX, if required, will be accomplished via usual air
   evacuation procedures after coordination with the DTRA Escort Team Chief and foreign
   Team Chief. (T-2)
   7.10.5. In the event of the death of an observation team member, the DTRA Escort Team
   Chief will provide any and all guidance. The death will not be reported through any channels
   until cleared by the DTRA Escort Team Chief. Before making arrangements for mortuary
   services, consult applicable U.S. Air Force regulations, local and state laws, U.S.-host nation
   arrangements, foreign preferences, the DTRA Escort Team Chief, and the servicing staff
   judge advocate (SJA). (T-1)
      7.10.5.1. The TCO will, after being cleared by the DTRA Escort Team Chief, report any
      death to the MAJCOM Treaty Office and to AF/A5XP (DSN (312) 224-0676 or
AFI16-604 28 MARCH 2012                                                                            51


       usaf.pentagon.af-a3-5.mbx.open-skies@mail.mil) as soon as practicable, along with
       circumstances of the death. (T-1)
       7.10.5.2. OPREPs/SITREPs detailing the serious injuries or death of an observation team
       member will be initiated as soon as practicable by the installation, in coordination with
       the DTRA Escort Team Chief, and will include AF/A5XP as an addressee. (T-1)
   7.10.6. All medical care provided to a non-U.S. member will be billed according to any host
   nation agreements. (T-0) All civilian medical care provided to a non-U.S. member will be
   billed by the civilian health care facility to the nearest consulate office of the country that the
   member is from or to DTRA.
7.11. Installation Security
   7.11.1. Foreign observation team members typically travel under Diplomatic passports. In
   any event, observation team members must be accorded the rights, privileges, and
   immunities outlined in the OST, Article XIII. As such, they and their accommodations,
   personal gear, and baggage are immune from search and seizure while they are on U.S.
   territory. Additionally, no foreign team member may be arrested or detained.
   7.11.2. The foreign observation team is identified by the DTRA Escort Team Chief at the
   POE. Their luggage and equipment are searched at the POE by DTRA and U.S. Customs
   personnel. Further searches are prohibited and any questions concerning searching should be
   directed to the DTRA Escort Team Chief. Note: This does not exempt the aircraft, air
   crews, and mission teams from the Hawaii agricultural inspection requirement.
   7.11.3. DTRA team members, their luggage, and hand-carried items are exempt from
   searches unless dictated by a specific base security situation. Note: This does not exempt
   the aircraft, air crews, and mission teams from the Hawaii agricultural inspection
   requirement.
   7.11.4. It is Air Force policy that if no specific threat exists against the observation team or
   the host installation before or during their visit, additional security requirements are neither
   warranted nor appropriate. Treatment of the observation team as distinguished visitors
   should be sufficient.
   7.11.5. It is Air Force policy that the local base escort team has the primary responsibility for
   ensuring the protection and safety of observation team members and for limiting access to
   them by non-essential personnel while on the host installation.
   7.11.6. If a threat arises before or during the visit of an observation team, the host
   installation will react appropriately, inform the DTRA Escort Team Chief (prior to arrival if
   possible), and brief the arriving team of the situation, the precautions they should take, and
   the protective measures being taken by the base. (T-2)
   7.11.7. If a threat exists during an OST activity at a host installation, consider billeting the
   observation team on-base and, depending on the threat, limiting/restricting their movement as
   much as possible. If a credible threat exists to OST activities and movement is required to
   off-base locations, base Security Forces will advise AFOSI and local law enforcement
   agencies. (T2)
   7.11.8. If a credible threat exists, treaty activities may be restricted to on-base and Security
   Forces personnel posted on the boundaries of areas used for lodging, dining, and other treaty
 52                                                                 AFI16-604 28 MARCH 2012


   activities. Off-base activities require coordination with local law enforcement. If the threat
   warrants, this information must be passed expeditiously to AF/A5XP. If required, a
   recommendation to consider terminating the visit and removing the visitors from the area
   will be passed by the Air Staff to the USG Interagency. (T-2)
   7.11.9. Foreign observation aircraft do not carry an assigned physical security protection
   level in accordance with AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense (classified FOUO); however, they
   must be protected as any foreign state aircraft. If the aircraft is to remain on station for a
   period of time, it must receive appropriate security protection measures. (T-2)
7.12. Photography
   7.12.1. The Air Force photography policy for OST activities on host installation facilities is
   identified in the following subparagraphs. This policy is designed to address photography
   primarily during aircraft inspections at U.S. Air Force airfields hosting OST observation
   missions. Specifically, it covers the foreign teams taking photography of the U.S. inspection
   of their aircraft and for the U.S. team (from DTRA) to record the inspection process for the
   foreign teams, if so requested by the foreign team.
      7.12.1.1. The public affairs office is responsible for all visual information activities at the
      installation and must be coordinated with prior to all OST activities. (T-2)
   7.12.2. Under the OST, the observed (i.e., hosting) State Party has the right to conduct a pre-
   flight inspection of the foreign observation aircraft and sensors to ensure that they conform to
   the aircraft and sensors that were previously certified for observation flights and have been
   notified for use for observation activities.
      7.12.2.1. It has become the practice of the parties to allow the observing (i.e., hosted)
      State Party to record the inspection process as it is being conducted by observed party
      inspectors. However, all photography must be coordinated with the installation TCO and
      the DTRA Escort Team Chief prior to use. (T-2)
      7.12.2.2. Equipment capable of recording images for this purpose has historically
      included cameras. Video cameras will not be used to record the aircraft inspection
      process for the hosted State Party. (T-1)
      7.12.2.3. Recording of the aircraft inspection by base Public Affairs and/or local media
      activities must be pre-coordinated with the Wing Commander, the installation TCO, and
      the DTRA Escort Team Chief. (T-2)
   7.12.3. While this photography policy does not override other Air Force photography
   policies, it does allow the U.S. Escort Team, foreign team members, and U.S. Technical
   Equipment Inspection (TEI) personnel to take photographs of the observation aircraft during
   the aircraft inspection and, if desired, to document via photography the status of the sensor
   covers upon arrival at a POE, after a transit flight to an OSA, and prior to departure from a
   POX. As this is an official Treaty activity, all photography equipment should be declared
   and state owned.
      7.12.3.1. At all times, other than aircraft inspection and recording condition of sensor
      covers, photography must be coordinated between the DTRA Escort Team Chief and the
      installation TCO who will request approval from appropriate base agencies. (T-2)
AFI16-604 28 MARCH 2012                                                                        53


     7.12.3.2. Requests for other mission-related or treaty-related photography must be
     submitted as soon as the need is known. TCOs will have pre-established coordination
     procedures to expeditiously process requests and must be able to advise on expected
     response time from base agencies. (T-3)
     7.12.3.3. Past experience indicates that the foreign observation team might attempt to
     take pictures, which—except during the recording of the aircraft inspection process—
     might contradict current base policies. Photographs are likely to be taken, upon
     arrival/landing at an airfield and on the ground during various arrival activities. TCOs
     must review the latest HQ USAF photography guidance for clarification of appropriate
     procedures for managing and reporting photography violations. (T-1)
  7.12.4. This photography policy does not give a third party (i.e., installation or other
  observers) authorization to photograph the aircraft inspection process or other mission-
  related activity on the flight line unless pre-coordinated with the DTRA Escort and the
  foreign Team Chiefs.
     7.12.4.1. Installation or MAJCOM personnel may take photographs of OST activities
     after satisfying the local approval process and after coordination between the installation
     TCO and the DTRA Escort Team Chief, who will coordinate with the foreign Team
     Chief. The group photo must also be coordinated and approved by the foreign Team
     Chief.
         7.12.4.1.1. It is routine practice of the States Parties to take a posed group
         photograph of the observation teams with installation hosts and local escorts in front
         of the observation aircraft while at the base, if practicable and weather permitting.
         This must be pre-coordinated with installation PA, local media processing facilities,
         and with the DTRA liaison prior to arrival of the aircraft. (T-3)
     7.12.4.2. Uncoordinated or unapproved photography of the foreign team and aircraft may
     become a diplomatic issue the USG will have to address.
  7.12.5. As any deviation from established treaty practices can have undesirable diplomatic
  effects, photography of the aircraft inspection process, to include documenting sensor cover
  status before/after transit flights, will be considered as exceptional circumstances and will be
  allowed to continue to the extent possible within the constraints of standing Air Force
  security guidance and installation policies.
     7.12.5.1. Local Commanders often authorize instances of flight line photography to
     support USG activities. DTRA Escort Teams receive this authorization specifically to
     support only Open Skies pre-flight inspection requirements. For any additional
     photography, pre-coordinate with the installation TCO who can advise of requirements
     and, when necessary, forward the request for consideration by appropriate authority.
     7.12.5.2. Installation Commanders should normally support these activities while making
     prudent efforts to protect security concerns.
     7.12.5.3. When unexpected circumstances occur for which Commanders may be
     expected to further limit photography, installation TCOs will expeditiously report to
     MAJCOMs, who will also expeditiously report to AF/A5XP, the circumstances,
     rationale, and results. (T-2)
 54                                                               AFI16-604 28 MARCH 2012


      7.12.5.4. Since prohibiting customary photography may be viewed by treaty partners as
      an infringement of their treaty rights, AF/A5XP will rapidly report the circumstances to
      AF A3/5, SAF/GCI, the Joint Staff, OSD Policy, and the OUSD(AT&L) Treaty Manager.
      AF/A5XP will also prepare responses to USG Interagency questions as appropriate.
   7.12.6. The use of portable equipment capable of recording images will be monitored by the
   U.S. Escort Team and observed by the base escort team.
      7.12.6.1. To facilitate understanding between all parties, the TCO will explicitly inform
      the DTRA Escort Team Chief of the policies applicable to that airfield. The TCO will
      specifically brief the arriving U.S. and foreign observation teams on the local
      photography policies and procedures applicable to the airfield, and will be responsible for
      ensuring compliance with these policies. (T-2)
      7.12.6.2. Photography will be carefully managed.
          7.12.6.2.1. Photographs will be oriented or framed to ensure only the intended image
          is taken. (T-3)
      7.12.6.3. The installation TCO must attempt to limit unwanted imagery collection by
      parking the Open Skies aircraft to avoid photography of other assets in the vicinity. (T-3)
          7.12.6.3.1. The observation aircraft can be placed in an isolated area away from other
          aircraft/buildings or shrouded by innocuous structures. In addition, other more
          sensitive aircraft can be placed in a secure hangar, in an isolated area away from other
          aircraft/buildings, or shrouded by innocuous structures.
   7.12.7. If there are any violations of this photography policy, they will be brought to the
   attention of the DTRA Escort Team Chief, who will address them immediately with the
   foreign Team Chief (if the violation is by the foreign team) or the individual involved (if the
   violation is by a member of the U.S. Escort Team).
      7.12.7.1. The observing party has a duty to respect the laws and regulations of the
      observed party.
      7.12.7.2. Such incidents will be briefed to the base security forces, raised in the After
      Action Report (AAR), and provided to the MAJCOM and Air Force Treaty Offices. (T-2)
   7.12.8. The OST, Article XIII, Section II, Paragraph 1, gives foreign inspectors diplomatic
   privileges and immunities, including the inviolability of their person and personal property.
   This means that to touch them or their property may violate their Treaty rights.
      7.12.8.1. At no time should personal property be confiscated or involuntarily taken from
      the foreign inspectors.
   7.12.9. Nothing in this policy authorizes or encourages overt intelligence collection or the
   allowance of intelligence collection by photography.
7.13. Operational Security (OPSEC)
   7.13.1. OPSEC is a process of identifying, analyzing, and controlling critical information
   indicating actions associated with military operations and other activities to:
      7.13.1.1. Identify those actions that can be observed by adversary intelligence systems;
AFI16-604 28 MARCH 2012                                                                          55


      7.13.1.2. Determine what specific indications could be collected, analyzed, and
      interpreted to derive critical information to be useful to adversaries; and,
      7.13.1.3. Select and execute measures that eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level the
      vulnerabilities of actions to adversary exploitation.
   7.13.2. The purpose of OPSEC is to reduce the vulnerability of Air Force missions to
   successful adversary collection and exploitation of critical information. OPSEC applies to all
   activities that prepare, sustain, or employ forces during all phases of operations.
   (AFI 10-701, Operations Security (OPSEC))
   7.13.3. It is not unexpected that members of foreign observation teams may attempt to gather
   information on our abilities, capabilities, operations, intentions, personnel, and organizations.
   It is incumbent on our host installation personnel to be observant and diligent in protecting
   information that might be used to compromise our security, while at the same time being
   courteous and pleasant.
   7.13.4. If inquiries or actions of a foreign observation team member raise suspicions, the
   host installation’s escort will notify the TCO, who will in turn notify the DTRA Escort Team
   Chief. Base Security Forces representatives shall be notified of any suspicious situations. (T-
   3)
7.14. Lodging and Messing
   7.14.1. Host installation TCOs will coordinate lodging and messing requirements/desires
   with the DTRA Escort Team Chief or his or her designated representative; however, the TCO
   may not always be able to accommodate desires. (T-3)
   7.14.2. DTRA prefers to billet OST teams off-base in a hotel that can accommodate both the
   entire U.S. and foreign teams. Coordination for off-base lodging, if arranged by the host
   TCO, will be through the base Lodging Office. The TCO may be required to facilitate non-
   Availability Letters for the observation team members for off-base lodging. (T-3)
      7.14.2.1. DTRA will coordinate with the TCO for all lodging support to ensure local
      installation/hotel contracts are adhered to.
   7.14.3. In the event of a threat situation, lodging will be arranged in on-base facilities. This
   may involve creativity due to the short-notice nature of OST activities and the relatively large
   size of the observation teams. (T-2)
   7.14.4. For on-base lodging, certain precautionary measures may be taken in preparing the
   rooms, but extraordinary measures are not necessarily appropriate. The TCO will coordinate
   with the DTRA Escort Team Chief regarding lodging requirements (such as housekeeping
   services, telephones, security protection and availability of a 24-hour on-site contact). (T-3)
   7.14.5. Meals, both on- and off-base, will be coordinated between the TCO and the DTRA
   Escort Team Chief or his or her designated representative. (T-3)
   7.14.6. U.S. observation team members will pay for their own accommodations and meals,
   while the DTRA Escort Team Class A Agent will pay for the foreign team members.
   7.14.7. The installation TCO will work with the Flight Kitchen to arrange for box lunches as
   requested by the DTRA Escort Team Chief. Payment for box lunches will typically be in
 56                                                               AFI16-604 28 MARCH 2012


   advance. The TCO will coordinate with the DTRA Escort Team to facilitate this payment.
   (T-3)
7.15. Transportation
   7.15.1. The host-installation TCO will coordinate transportation requirements with the
   DTRA Escort Team Chief or his or her designated representative. (T-2)
      7.15.1.1. OST activities are conducted on a strict timeline. Transportation must account
      for road closures, base gate security procedures, and traffic situations to ensure adherence
      to this timeline. Transportation timelines must be padded to account for inclement
      weather, traffic, or other unexpected delays. The OST activity must accommodate these
      situations.
      7.15.1.2. The TCO will attempt to accommodate the DTRA Team Chief’s requests for
      support of transportation for off-base and cultural activities for the foreign teams as much
      as practical and within existing policies/guidelines/restrictions. In cases where
      installation Commander approval is required for the type of activity or location, the TCO
      will facilitate that request. (T-2)
   7.15.2. The number and size of vehicles required will be determined by the activities being
   performed.
      7.15.2.1. For initial arrival, departure, and movement to/from lodging for the first/last
      time, a separate van or truck for luggage must be provided. (T-3)
