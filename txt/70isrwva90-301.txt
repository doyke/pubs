1. AFI 90-301 outlines the Inspector General Complaints Resolution program. It ensures you have the right to present a complaint
without fear of reprisal. Reprisal is defined as taking, or threatening to take, an unfavorable personnel action or withholding, or
threatening to withhold, a favorable personnel action on a military member for making or preparing a protected communication.

2. Experience has shown your immediate supervisor, first sergeant, or commander are in the best position to provide a quicker and
often better, solution than the IG. However, you are not required to follow the chain of command or to get prior approval from
your supervisor before filing a complaint at any level within the IG system.

3. While all military and civilian members have the right to call the IG for assistance, the complaint categories listed below are not
specific to the IG program as they are covered by other directives. If your problem lies in one of these areas, you are best served
by contacting the referral agencies listed below.
