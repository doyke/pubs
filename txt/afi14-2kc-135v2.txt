                                          Chapter 1

                                GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. This volume provides intelligence evaluators (IE) and examinees with procedures
and evaluation criteria to be used during knowledge and task phases of initial (INIT) and
periodic mission evaluations (MSN). All evaluations will be conducted IAW the provisions of
AFI 14-202, Volume 2 and this publication. The examinee must satisfactorily demonstrate the
ability to perform required duties safely and effectively.
1.2. Waivers. MAJCOM/A2s will courtesy-copy AMC/A2 regarding all waiver requests and
responses. AMC/A2 will notify AF/A2DF of significant trends in waiver requests if such
correspondence indicates the need to readdress existing policy and guidance.
1.3. Procedures.
   1.3.1. Prior to any formal evaluation conducted by a qualified IE, the examinee must have
   completed all Mission Qualification Training (MQT) or Specialized Training (ST)
   requirements, as outlined in AFI 14-2KC-135, Volume 1, KC-135 Unit Intelligence Training.
   Additionally, the examinee must have on file a satisfactory gradesheet (see Attachment 4 of
   AFI 14-2KC-135 Volume 1, for gradesheet elements) from an intelligence qualification
   trainer for each area listed in Table 2.1. The gradesheets will be filed in the individual’s
   qualification training record. The IE will use the AF Form 4381, Intelligence Gradesheet, to
   assist in grading the individual areas during the evaluation. Upon completion of the AF
   Form 4350, Certificate of Intelligence Qualification, the IE may destroy the AF Form 4381.
   (T-2)
   1.3.2. IEs will use the evaluation criteria contained in Chapter 3 for conducting all
   intelligence mission qualification and specialized training evaluations. To ensure standard
   and objective evaluations, IEs will be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed evaluation
   criteria. (T-2)
   1.3.3. Prior to commencing, the IE will brief the examinee on the evaluation conduct,
   purpose, requirements and applicable criteria. The examinee will accomplish required
   planning IAW the duty position being evaluated. The examinee will provide IEs with a copy
   of necessary data or materials. (T-2)
   1.3.4. Evaluations should take place in conjunction with in-garrison events to the maximum
   extent possible. Evaluations during exercises or deployments are not prohibited; however,
   units should apply operational risk management principles to the scheduling of the
   evaluation. (Real world contingencies may provide a unique opportunity to conduct an
   evaluation; however, factors beyond the control of the examinee and IE may preclude its
   successful completion.). When evaluation in a realistic environment is not possible,
   examinations may be conducted via an alternate method (i.e., simulated, staged, or by verbal
   examination) in order to complete the evaluation. Document the reasons and type of
   alternate method used in the Comments section of the AF Form 4350. (T-2)
   1.3.5. The IE will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the evaluation. This debrief will include
   the examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than
   qualified) and any required additional training. (T-2)
 4                                                         AFI14-2KC-135V2 21 February 2013


1.4. Grading Instructions. The IE will compare examinee performance for each area
accomplished during the evaluation with the standards provided in this volume and assign an
appropriate grade for the area. Derive the overall grade from the area grades based on a
composite for the observed events and tasks IAW this publication. Grading will be conducted in
the following manner: (T-2)
     1.4.1. IEs will use the grading criteria in this volume to determine individual area grades. IE
     judgment must be exercised when the wording for general graded areas is subjective and
     when specific situations are not covered.
     1.4.2. If the examinee receives an unqualified area grade in any area identified as critical, an
     overall qualification level of Q-3 will be assigned.
     1.4.3. IEs will be expected to use their personal experience and knowledge in the assessment
     of examinee performance and determination of the overall grade.
     1.4.4. General Criteria. The following grading criteria will be used to grade individual
     items:
        1.4.4.1. Q. Qualified. Performance is correct. Quickly recognizes and corrects errors.
        1.4.4.2. Q-. Qualified with discrepancies. Performance is safe, but indicates limited
        proficiency. Makes errors of omission or commission.
        1.4.4.3. U.   Unqualified.    Performance is unsafe or indicates lack of knowledge or
        ability.
1.5. Additional Training. IEs are responsible for recommending additional training as
necessary. Document additional training and completion IAW AFI 14-202, Volume 2. (T-2)
1.6. Unsatisfactory Performance. Examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade (Q-3) will
be placed in supervised status until recommended additional training is completed and/or a
reevaluation is successfully accomplished. If an examinee receives a Q-3 on a mission
evaluation, he/she may not perform mission duties or specialized duties unsupervised until
remedial actions are accomplished. If an examinee receives a Q-3 on a specialized evaluation,
he/she may not perform specialized duties until remedial actions are accomplished, but he/she
may perform mission duties unless specifically restricted. (T-3)
1.7. Documentation. Units will document intelligence evaluations on AF Form 4350 and in
coordination with AF/A2 approved processes regarding online documentation. (T-2)
AFI14-2KC-135V2 21 February 2013                                                                5


                                           Chapter 2

                             EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1. General. Evaluation requirements are listed in Table 2.1. All required areas must be
included in the intelligence evaluation. If the IE determines the required area cannot be
adequately evaluated in a realistic environment (or by an alternate method), an additional
evaluation will be necessary to complete the requirements. (T-2)
2.2. Evaluation Cycle. Periodic evaluations will be conducted on a 20-month cycle.
Evaluations expire on the last day of the 19th month following the month in which the task phase
was successfully completed. The individual will enter the eligibility window 14 months after the
INIT MSN/MSN evaluation (6-month period prior to expiration date). Extensions may be
granted by the Chief of Wing Intelligence IAW AFI 14-202, Volume 2.
2.3. Intelligence Mission Qualification Evaluation.
   2.3.1. Knowledge Evaluation. Knowledge evaluations will be conducted as part of the initial
   and periodic mission qualification evaluations to evaluate the examinee’s proficiency in KC-
   135 systems and capabilities, threat knowledge, visual recognition (VR), personnel recovery
   (PR) and intelligence integration in force protection (FP) academics and KC-135 unit
   intelligence procedures. For mission qualification evaluations (initial and periodic),
   examinees will complete a knowledge test from the unit’s master question file (MQF) that
   covers: KC-135 weapons systems, threats, personnel recovery and intelligence integration in
   force protection academics. Examinees will take a separate VR test. Both examinations will
   be recorded on the AF Form 4350. Knowledge examinations may also be required during
   specialized qualification evaluations.     Reference Table 2.1 for required knowledge
   examinations. (T-2)
   2.3.2. Task Evaluation. Units will assemble evaluation materials using current intelligence,
   unit tasking and area of responsibility (AOR) scenarios that incorporate all appropriate
   evaluation requirements from Table 2.1. Research, Analysis and Dissemination (RAD)
   involves knowledge intelligence personnel should be applying throughout all areas of the
   evaluation and will be evaluated as subsets of each applicable graded area as indicated on
   individual gradesheets. The following guidelines are provided to assist in constructing
   evaluation materials. (T-2)
       2.3.2.1. Manual Order of Battle (OB). The number of coordinates in the OB plotting
       exercise should be of sufficient volume to be challenging, yet not so overwhelming that
       the time taken is beyond that necessary to determine proficiency. Examinee should have
       a variety of threats/items to plot to ensure correct symbology is used. The exercise may
       include both geographic coordinates (geocoords) and Military Grid Reference System
       (MGRS) coordinates. The scenario may include erroneous information to mirror the fog
       of war by including intentionally incorrect coordinates or types of threats for that
       particular AOR, thereby allowing the IE to assess the examinee’s ability to identify errors
       and question the validity of information. The examinee may use MIL STD 2525C,
       Common Warfighting Symbology, and US Army Field Manual/US Marine Corps
       Reference Publication, FM 1-02/MCRP 5-12A, Operational Terms and Graphics, for
 6                                                       AFI14-2KC-135V2 21 February 2013


       reference. When using a scenario developed by the examinee, OB coordinates listed on
       Mission Evaluation Worksheet will be evaluated by the IE for accuracy.
       2.3.2.2. Automated OB. Examinee should be provided with a variety of OB sources
       from which to pull data. When using an examinee-developed scenario, evaluate the
       examinee’s ability to develop and save threat files; insert accurate data; load, update and
       purge data to ensure quality control of the displayed data; and question the accuracy of
       the information for a particular AOR. Ensure the opportunity exists for the examinee to
       be evaluated on his or her ability to manipulate OB displays and print using the
       intelligence support systems available. Evaluate the examinee’s ability to convert
       coordinates between geocoords and MGRS and degrees/minutes/seconds (DD/MM/SS)
       to degrees/minutes.minutes (DD/MM.mm).
       2.3.2.3. Intelligence Briefings.      The examinee should assemble briefings from
       information provided by the evaluator. Sources of information may include: message
       traffic, intelligence reports, imagery, etc. Evaluated briefings include: pre-deployment
       briefing, pre-mission briefing.
       2.3.2.4. Air Tasking Order (ATO), Airspace Control Order (ACO) and Special
       Instructions (SPINS). Scenario, actual contingency or exercise materials may be used for
       this purpose. Provide enough information that the examinee’s unit is not the sole unit
       tasked on the ATO. Ensure the opportunity exists to evaluate the examinee’s proficiency
       in identifying and breaking out the elements of ATO/ACO/SPINS to include unit tasking,
       air space control, combat search and rescue, receiver and track data.
       2.3.2.5. Intelligence Integration in Mission Planning. Actual contingency planning or
       exercise materials and imagery may be used. Ensure the opportunity exists to evaluate
       the examinee’s proficiency in planning, coordinating and conducting the entire mission
       planning process.
       2.3.2.6. Debriefing. Aircrew debriefings should be conducted with aircrew whenever
       possible. The evaluator may construct inject cards or coordinate with aircrews to identify
       a particular threat scenario for the debriefings. Ensure there is enough activity to
       represent the typical level of detail for a threat scenario commensurate with unit AOR
       tasking. Grade the examinee’s ability to control the debriefing, ask amplifying questions
       and recognize irrelevant information.
       2.3.2.7. Intelligence Reports. Mission reports (MISREP) and intelligence reports should
       be constructed using information provided in the aircrew debriefing. MISREPs and
       INTREPs should be completed IAW MAJCOM/theater intelligence reporting directives.
2.4. External Intelligence Trainer Evaluation (EIT). EIT evaluations will consist of a
knowledge examination and a task evaluation conducted IAW AFI 14-202, Volume 2. Only
qualified EITs may conduct unsupervised intelligence training for aircrew, security forces (SF)
or any other organization outside the Intelligence Flight. Upon completion of EIT training
profiles, the EIT will demonstrate knowledge of the information presented by successfully
completing a test based on the questions from the Master Question File (MQF) (85 percent
minimum to pass). The EIT also will be evaluated on his or her ability to present training in each
applicable sub-category (threat knowledge, VR, Collection and Reporting, PR, FP Intelligence
AFI14-2KC-135V2 21 February 2013                                                               7


Training). Evaluators will give the examinee no less than four hours notice of the subject matter
or briefing topic for the evaluation. (T-2)
   2.4.1. In certain circumstances it may be beneficial to qualify an individual to conduct
   training in one or more individual EIT events at a time. The individual must complete the
   specific training identified for the event and be evaluated on the task or briefing element by
   an IE. The individual must maintain currency for the subject matter and must be reevaluated
   periodically. (T-2)
   2.4.2. Subsequent EIT evaluations may be conducted as part of the periodic mission
   evaluation. All applicable EIT and MSN areas must be evaluated.
   2.4.3. An EIT receiving a grade of “U” or “with additional training” in any grading area
   must not perform EIT duties until additional training is complete. This restriction is placed
   in the Comments section and “yes” is marked in Restrictions on the AF Form 4350.
   2.4.4. An EIT receiving an area grade of “U” or “with additional training” in any grading
   area will result in an overall Q-3 for the EIT evaluation. (T-2)
   2.4.5. All EITs will be graded using the criteria in Chapter 3. (T-2)
2.5. Intelligence Evaluator Evaluation. IE evaluations will be conducted IAW AFI 14-202,
Volume 2. Individuals will be qualified as IEs upon completion of the IE specialized training
profiles, successful IE evaluation and endorsement by the Chief of Wing Intelligence. IEs will
be graded using criteria in Chapter 3. (T-2)
   2.5.1. There is no requirement for subsequent periodic IE evaluations.
   2.5.2. An IE receiving a grade of “U” or “with additional training” in any grading area must
   not perform IE duties until additional training is complete. This restriction is placed in the
   Comments section and “yes” is marked in Restrictions on the AF Form 4350. (T-2)
   2.5.3. An IE receiving an area grade of “U” or “with additional training” in any grading area
   will result in an overall Q-3 for the IE evaluation. (T-2)
   2.5.4. Intelligence Evaluators will be graded using criteria in Chapter 3.
