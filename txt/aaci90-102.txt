1. PURPOSE/SCOPE: This instruction documents the Air Armament Center (AAC)
committee structure and supporting processes for addressing internal and external requests that
impact range and installation planning. Reference Attachment 1. for AAC’s key committees and
top-level supporting processes.
2. BACKGROUND: Eglin is the largest Air Force Base (AFB) in the free world and is
composed of 724 square miles of land with 36 specific test areas, 124,642 square miles of the
Eglin Gulf Test and Training Range (EGTTR) and a total of 127,868 square miles of charted
airspace which extends south to the Florida Keys. Eglin physically spans three Florida counties;
Santa Rosa, Okaloosa and Walton and has an additional 750 acres on Cape San Blas in Gulf
County. Eleven municipalities are located in close proximity to the Eglin boundary and affect,
or are affected by, Eglin’s military mission activities. AAC, headquartered at Eglin AFB, is one
of four product centers in the Air Force Materiel Command. AAC is the focal point for all Air
Force armament and is responsible for the development, acquisition, testing, deployment, and
sustainment of all air-delivered weapons. Eglin AFB is home to the 46th Test Wing (46 TW)
and the 96th Air Base Wing (96 ABW). The 46 TW is one of 24 activities identified as a DoD
Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB). The 96 ABW, Eglin’s host wing, supports more
than 62 major organizations including activities from DoD, Army and Navy.
3. RANGE OPERATING AUTHORITY (ROA) AND INSTALLATION COMMANDER
(IC) PLANNING RESPONSIBILITIES:
     3.1. The 46th Test Wing Commander (46 TW/CC) is designated as the Eglin ROA by AFI
     13-212, Range Planning and Operations. The ROA is responsible for coherent and
     sustainable range development that considers the interests of all organizations supporting or
     using the Eglin Range complex. The ROA is responsible for developing and maintaining a
     MAJCOM-approved Comprehensive Range Plan (CRP) that identifies shortfalls in current
     and projected range capabilities and guides future range development to address the
     shortfalls. The CRP documents both internal and external encroachment management issues
     and identifies potential mission impacts to ranges and associated airspace. In partnership
     with Eglin community planners, the ROA and support staff work with the surrounding
     federal, state, and local governments to minimize external encroachments. The ROA utilizes
     the Range Development Executive Steering Committee (RDESC) to help plan and manage
     compatible development and utilization of the Eglin MRTFB.
     3.2. The 96th Air Base Wing Commander (96 ABW/CC) is designated the Eglin AFB
     Installation Commander in accordance with AFMC/CC Memo, 27 Feb 2004, Designation of
     AFMC Air Base Wing Commander (ABW/CC) as Installation Commander (IC) (Ref
     Attachment 2). The IC supports the AAC, tenant commands, associate units with traditional
     military services and all the services of a small city. The IC is responsible for airfield
     support, facilities, real property management and facility siting approval on Eglin Main,
     Duke Field, Site C-6, Camp Rudder, the 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne) (7SPG (A))
     Cantonment area, Choctaw Field and the building complex of the Navy Explosive Ordnance
     Disposal (EOD) School (NAVSCOLEOD) on Range D-51. The IC supports mutually
     beneficial community outreach activities and initiatives with local governments and
     commerce leaders. Installation community planners work closely with military range
     planners and municipal planners in neighboring jurisdictions to ensure that development
     around Eglin is compatible with current and future missions. The IC utilizes the Facilities
     Board (FB) to help plan and manage Eglin’s installation requirements.
AACI90-102 21 MARCH 2011                                                                    3


  3.3. The ROA and IC work together to ensure Eglin AFB is properly sustained to meet the
  needs of the current and future warfighter. Both commanders are responsible for mission
  sustainability which includes identifying and managing both internal and external
  encroachment issues. Although the ROA has the lead responsibility for the MRTFB and the
  IC has lead for the installation and interagency planning, they must provide guidance,
  direction and full support to each other to ensure compatible growth on and around Eglin
  AFB. Communication, coordination and collaboration between the two commanders and
  their supporting staffs are enhanced through AAC’s Committee Structure.
4. COMMITTEE ROLES, RESPONSIBILITIES AND MEMBERSHIP:
  4.1. The Mission Integration Team (MIT). The MIT serves as the single point of contact
  responsible for collecting, reviewing and tracking all internal and external requests to
  reconfigure Eglin property. Internal requests are those submitted by DoD organizations.
  Examples of internal requests include requests for beddown of a new mission or a
  reconfiguration or expansion of an existing mission on the Eglin Range complex or within a
  Cantonment area. External requests are those submitted by a non-DoD entity and are
  typically submitted by the local community, primarily for use of Eglin real property for the
  benefit of the community. The MIT serves as a “clearing-house” function, ensuring that a
  request is submitted to and worked by the appropriate AAC committee(s).
     4.1.1. The MIT facilitates communication, coordination, and collaboration across AAC’s
     committee structure on cross-cutting requests or issues. Since the MIT works both range
     and installation issues/requests, MIT co-chairs are selected by the 46 TW/CC and 96
     ABW/CC. MIT co-chairs, typically 46 TW and 96 ABW Vice Commanders, are
     members of the RDESC and FB committees thus facilitating communication,
     coordination and collaboration across the committees. MIT co-chairs receive guidance
     and direction from the RDESC and FB chairs who develop their strategic priorities with
     input from AAC/CC and/or the AAC Executive Council (EC). MIT members include
     subject matter experts from the center and wing Plans and Programs Offices (XP) and
     civil engineers.
  4.2. The Range Development Executive Steering Committee (RDESC). The RDESC is
  chaired by the 46 TW/CC who serves as the ROA. The RDESC is a senior-level decision
  making body whose primary mission is to ensure the Eglin MRTFB is operated and
  developed for the maximum benefit to the DoD in a manner that sustains the military
  mission, is environmentally responsible, and considers regional interests. Eglin’s military
  support capabilities include airspace, the EGTTR, frequency spectrum and test and training
  areas and sites. The RDESC also conducts strategic planning for the Eglin MRTFB through
  the development/implementation of a Comprehensive Range Plan to support current and
  future DoD missions which link to and support the Installation Master Plan.
     4.2.1. RDESC membership includes 96 ABW/CC, 46 TW/CV, AAC/EB, AAC/SE,
     AAC/JA, AAC/XP, 46 TW/XP, 96 ABW/XP, 46 RANG/TD, 46 OG/CA, 96 CEG, 96
     AMDS/SGPB, 33 FW, 53 WG, 7 SFG(A), Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions
     Directorate (AFRL/MN), 6th Ranger Training Battalion (6RTB), 20th Space Surveillance
     Squadron (20 SPS), NAVSCOLEOD, Naval Air Station (NAS) Whiting Field and Air
     Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) at Hurlburt Field. Read-ahead packages
     are posted to the RDESC Community of Practice (CoP) at least three business days prior
4                                                               AACI90-102 21 MARCH 2011


       to the meeting. Official meeting minutes are posted to the CoP no later than five
       business days after the meeting.
       4.2.2. The Range Configuration Control Committee (RC3). The RDESC is supported by
       the RC3. The RC3 is responsible for reviewing and conducting mission impact analysis
       for any request that could potentially impact the Eglin MRTFB. The RC3 develops
       recommendation options for each request and submits them to the RDESC for approval
       or resolution. The RC3 also oversees the maintenance of the Land Test Area Panel and
       the Range Road Working Group, and provides routine status updates to the RDESC. The
       RC3 is co-chaired by the senior civilians in the 46th Range and Operations Groups. RC3
       membership includes subject matter experts from the center and wing XPs, civil
       engineers, safety, legal, 33 FW, 53 WG, 7 SFG(A), AFRL/MN, 6 RTB, NAVSCOLEOD,
       NAS Whiting Field and AFSOC at Hurlburt Field.
    4.3. The Facilities Board (FB). The FB is chaired by the 96 ABW/CC who serves as the IC.
    The IC uses the FB committee structure to help plan and manage Eglin AFB. The FB
    provides a corporate review and final decision regarding planning, siting and use of real
    property facilities, infrastructure, and resources in support of Eglin’s multiple missions
    across the entire installation. The FB is a senior-level decision making body, responsible for
    evaluating facility requirements, reviewing proposed construction programs and prioritizing
    the most effective use of AFMC Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization (SRM) and
    military construction (MILCON) funds. The FB also conducts strategic planning for the
    Eglin cantonments through the development/implementation of the Eglin Installation Master
    Plan to support current and future DoD missions which links to and supports the
    Comprehensive Range Plan. The FB is the approval authority for both in-grants and out-
    grants. An in-grant is an instrument used when the Air Force gains an interest in or control
    of real property. An out-grant is used when the Air Force grants a non-DoD entity temporary
    use of Air Force property by a lease, easement, license, or permit typically for the overall
    benefit of the community
       4.3.1. FB membership includes AAC/CS, AAC/EB, 46 TW/CC, 33 FW/CC, 53 WG/CC,
       7 SFG(A)/CC, 919 SOW/CC, AFRL/RW, 6 RTB/CC, 20 SPS/CC, NAVSCOLEOD/CO,
       96 ABW/CV, 96 CEG/CC, 9 SOS/CC, NAS Whiting Field, 1 SOW, AAC/XP, AAC/SE,
       AAC/JA, AAC/EB, 46 TW/XP and 96 ABW/XP. Read-ahead packages are posted to the
       FB CoP at least three business days prior to the meeting. Official meeting minutes are
       posted no later than five business days after the meeting.
       4.3.2. Facilities Working Group (FWG). The FB is supported by four subcommittees.
       The FWG determines the most effective use of contract programming funds for SRM and
       MILCON by prioritizing all facility projects and then presenting to the FB for final
       decision. The FWG also oversees the Eglin real estate in-grant/out-grant process. The
       FWG is chaired by the 96 ABW/CV and membership includes 46 TW/CV, 33 FW/CV,
       53 WG/CV, 7 SFG(A)/CV, 919 SOW/CV, AFRL/RW, 6 RTB/CV, 20 SPS/CV,
       NAVSCOLEOD/XO, 96 CEG/CC, 9 SOS/CV, NAS Whiting Field, 1 SOW, AAC/XP,
       AAC/SE, AAC/JA, AAC/EB, 46 TW/XP and 96 ABW/XP.
       4.3.3. Installation Development Committee (IDC). The IDC is responsible for future
       base development and facility siting approval within Eglin’s cantonment areas which
       include Eglin Main, Duke Field, C-6, Camp Rudder, Choctaw Field, the 7 SFG complex
AACI90-102 21 MARCH 2011                                                                        5


     and the building complex of the NAVSCOLEOD on Range D-51. The IDC reviews
     mission impact of approving real estate applications for land or facility use within the
     Cantonment areas. The IDC is chaired by the 96 ABW/CV. IDC membership includes
     AAC/SE, AAC/XP, 33 FW/CV, 46 TW/CV, 53 WG/CV, 919 SOW/XP, 96 CEG/CC.
     4.3.4. Space Management Committee (SMC). The SMC is responsible for determining
     the most effective use of existing space, consolidating functions to reduce O&M
     expenditures and energy consumption, periodically reviewing space use versus space
     authorized and identifying space requirements for new programs. The SMC is chaired by
     96 ABW/CV and membership includes AAC/CS, AAC/XP, AAC/SE, 33 FW/CV, 53
     WG/CV, 96 CEG/CC, 919 MSG/CD and AFRL/RW.
     4.3.5. Traffic Planning Group (TPG). The TPG conducts traffic planning and analysis
     and identifies new projects to move traffic safely and efficiently on the Eglin installation.
     The TPG is chaired by 96 ABW/CV and membership includes AAC/SEO, 53 WG/SE, 33
     FW/SE, 919 SOW/SE, 96 CEG/CC, 96 FSS/CC, 96 LRS/CC and 796 CES/CC.
  4.4. Executive Council (EC). The EC is AAC’s most senior-level decision forum with the
  primary responsibility of strategic planning and aligning center activities with strategic
  priorities and resolving any strategic and/or cross-cutting issues. The EC utilizes a
  systematic process to work through known strategic issues and also provides a senior-level
  decision making forum to address “pop-up” or spontaneous, cross-cutting discussions. The
  EC agenda is sent to members one day prior to meeting. Formal meeting minutes are
  provided to EC members within 1 week of the meeting.
     4.4.1. The EC is chaired by AAC/CC. AAC/CA and AAC/CV serve as alternate chairs
     if AAC/CC is unavailable. EC membership includes AAC/CS, 96 ABW/CC, 46 TW/CC,
     AAC/AQ, AAC/EB, AAC/DP, AAC/EN, AAC/FM, AAC/JA, AAC/PK, AAC/SE,
     AAC/XP, AAC/XR, and 46 TW/CZ.
     4.4.2. AAC senior leadership maintains situational awareness of current and future range
     and installation initiatives and issues that could potentially impact AAC from a strategic
     perspective. AAC/CV serves as the conduit between the EC and the RDESC/FB
     committee processes. To maintain current knowledge of ongoing and projected range and
     installation initiatives and issues, AAC/CV reviews RDESC and FB read-ahead packages
     prior to each committee meeting. Working in collaboration with the respective
     committee chair, AAC/CV determines which issues, if any, are presented to AAC/CC
     and/or the EC for guidance and direction prior to final decision.
5. COMMITTEE STRUCTURE PROCESS:
  5.1. AAC’s committee structure and supporting process (Attachment 1) is used by AAC
  leadership to plan and manage the Eglin MRTFB and installation.
  5.2. The decision making process is initiated when a request to reconfigure Eglin property is
  submitted to the Eglin IC. If a formal request is submitted to someone other than the Eglin
  IC, the individual receiving the request will send it to the Eglin IC to initiate the process.
  Any request relating to reconfiguration of Eglin airspace or the EGTTR can be sent directly
  to the Eglin OPR (46 TW/XP) for action.
 6                                                               AACI90-102 21 MARCH 2011


     5.3. The IC sends the request to the MIT. After reviewing the requirement/issue, the MIT
     forwards the request to the appropriate Eglin OPR. See Attachment 3 for the list of Eglin
     OPRs.
     5.4. The Eglin OPR notifies the submitter that the request was received and is being worked,
     answers any questions and provides an estimated completion date.
     5.5. The Eglin OPR works the request using existing processes (Range Configuration
     Control, New/Expanded Siting, Real Estate Request, proposed Oil/Gas programs within the
     EGTTR, encroachment mission impact analysis, Beddown/Site Survey, or new Eglin
     initiative).
     5.6. The MIT receives routine status updates on open requests from the Eglin OPR and
     provides updates to senior leadership as necessary.
     5.7. When the proposed response is complete, the Eglin OPR presents the recommendation
     to the appropriate committee(s). When there is a potential impact to both the MRTFB and
     the installation, or if the issue cannot be resolved by the MIT, requests will be sent to both
     the RDESC and FB for parallel review.
     5.8. If the proposed Eglin response is politically sensitive or does not align with the AAC
     Strategic Plan as determined by AAC/CV, 46 TW/CC, and/or 96 ABW/CC, the proposal will
     be presented to AAC/CC and/or the EC for guidance and direction.
     5.9. After all approvals are complete, the Eglin OPR dispatches the response and maintains
     formal records associated with the request for future reference.
6. COMMITTEE LINKAGE: Due to the size, complexity and dynamic nature of Eglin
AFB’s many missions, communication, coordination and collaboration among its key decision-
making committees is critical to mission success. The committee structure described in this
instruction facilitates the needed interaction among senior leaders and subject matter experts in a
streamlined and efficient framework that enables decision-making at the proper leadership level.
