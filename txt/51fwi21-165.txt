printed night flying rules, by 1600 or 2 hours after the last land, whichever occurs last”.
Changed from “Coord” to “Info” in Attachment 3, 51 MOS/CC or 51 MOS/MXO, under the
“Within Fly Window”, “Change to Muns Rqmt’s”, “Config Changes Name, Office”, “Change
Sched Mx-Internal to AMU” and “Change Sched Mx-External to AMU”. Deleted paragraphs:

asterisks (*)
1. Responsibilities. Commanders at all levels are responsible for compliance with this
instruction.
2. Standardization.
     2.1. Normal scheduling practices for the 51 FW will follow the standardized guidelines
     below:
        2.1.1. Normal flying at Osan AB occurs from 0600 to 2400 hours.
        2.1.2. Engine starts will not occur earlier than 0530 hours.
        2.1.3. Aircraft Maintenance Units (AMUs) and Fighter Squadrons (FSs) will attempt a
        single go on Fridays with all aircraft recovered no later than 1400L hours. (Exception:
        Operational Check Flight (OCF), Functional Check Flight (FCF), cross country
        departures and returns, and incentive sorties).
            2.1.3.1. AMUs and FSs have the option of flexing to a two-go Friday as required for
            training and managing the annual flying hour program; however, it requires prior
            coordination and should be forecasted in the monthly schedule, and should consist of
            a pit and go turn.
        2.1.4. The maximum number of aircraft committed to the daily aircraft (local sorties,
        static displays, cross-country departures, TDY departures) schedule should not exceed
        65% of the Primary Aircraft Inventory (PAI).
        2.1.5. The Weekly/Daily Flying Schedule Coordination AF Form 2407 matrix
        (attachment 3) will be used to route all changes to the printed weekly schedule.
     2.2. Quiet Hours Policy.
        2.2.1. 51 FW quiet hour period is 2400-0530 hours daily and 2400-0800 hours on
        weekends and holidays. Operations during these periods require coordination through the
        51 FW Command Post for 51 OG/CC approval. 51 FW night flying and contingency
        exercise operations are exempt from this additional coordination.
        2.2.2. 51st Operations Support Squadron (51 OSS) Current Operations Flight accepts
        requests for, and will post quiet hour periods. After approval, they will notify: 51
        FW/CV,                                   51                                  OG/CC,
        51 MXG/CC, 51 AMXS/MXA, 51 OSS/OSA, 51 OSS Tower/RAPCON, 51
        MOS/MXOOP, and the 25/36 FS of the date, time and event requiring quiet hours.
     2.3. Cross Country Sorties.
        2.3.1. Squadron planned cross country (XC) sorties will be posted on the monthly
        calendar and incorporated into the weekly planning process. Use of like Mission Design
        Series (MDS) bases for XC support will be utilized to the maximum extent possible.
51FWI21-165 7 APRIL 2010                                                                       3


     2.3.2. Aircraft returning to Osan AB on a Saturday/Sunday or holiday preceding a
     normally scheduled fly-day, will have the total number of aircraft returned deducted from
     the next fly-day’s committed aircraft. Aircraft are required to be prepared (including
     configurations) for the fly-day while most agencies required for support are not available
     on Saturday/Sunday or holidays (reconfigurations will be accomplished on a normal duty
     day).
     2.3.3. AMUs with aircraft returning from deployment/TDY will require a minimum 1
     duty day reconstitution on the next scheduled fly-day.
     2.3.4. AMU/FSs will minimize split operations to the greatest extent possible and
     consider taking maximum numbers of aircraft/personnel to minimize split operations.
     Maximum effort will be made to balance maintenance capabilities and operations
     requirements while aircraft and supporting resources (personnel and equipment) are
     deployed/split operations in order to meet Flying Hour Program (FHP).
  2.4. Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM)/Contract Inputs, AFTO Form 781, ARMS
  Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, will be returned to 51 MXG (to include AMU
  debrief and 51 MOS/MXOOP) and 51 OG by the most reliable means available (i.e. fax or
  email) within 24-hours of landing.
  2.5. Static Display Requests.
     2.5.1. 51 FW Public Affairs (51 FW/PA) and other organizations will submit static
     display requests to 51 AMXS/MXA with an information copy to 51 MOS/MXOOP, 51
     OSS/OSCS a minimum of 2 weeks in advance, or as soon as requirements become
     known. 51 AMXS/MXA will forward approved requests to 51 OSS/OSCS.
     2.5.2. 51 OSS/OSCS will present static display requests at the 51 OG/MXG Weekly
     scheduling meeting for approval and squadron designation/assignment. AMU dedicated
     schedulers will ensure all static display requirements are reflected in the appropriate long
     range maintenance plan when applicable. In addition, static display requirements will be
     identified (by tail number) in the weekly schedule checkerboard and maintenance page.
     2.5.3. In the event of a static display cancellation, 51 FW/PA or the requesting
     organization will notify 51 OSS/OSCS as soon as possible. 51 OSS/OSCS will
     immediately notify 51 AMXS/CC, 51 MOS/MXOOM and 51 MOS/MXOOP of the
     cancellation.

   6.4. AMU dedicated schedulers will load pen and ink change in Integrated Maintenance
   Data System (IMDS) by 1700 Friday or last duty day of the week prior to the affected week.
7. Flying Scheduling Effectiveness.
   7.1. Surge Rules. Surges will be scheduled IAW ACCI 21-165, paragraph 4.10.
       7.1.1. The FS/DO will coordinate with the respective AMU OIC to determine frequency
       and extent of surge operations. To maximize airframe availability during surge
       operations, a one-go day prior to the start of surge operations is preferred. A no-fly
       reconstitution day immediately following the cessation of surge operations is also
       preferred. The 51 MXG/CC and 51 OG/CC will approve exceptions to this rule.
   7.2. Local Option Cause Code of KAS will be utilized to track deviations caused by Korean
   airspace issues. Examples include deviations caused by “Big Top” movements, airspace
   cancelations, airspace changes, lack of usable airspace within the normal flying window, etc.
8. Maintenance Scheduling Effectiveness (MSE).
   8.1. Computations.
       8.1.1. For MSE computation purposes, credit will be awarded as long as the phase
       inspection is accomplished by the scheduled stop date of the inspection. The standard
       number of days based off historical flow data to complete the phase inspection per MDS
       is as follows: A-10 (500-hr inspection only) = 10 duty days; F-16 (400-hr inspection
       only) = 7 duty days.
9. Flying Scheduling Reporting Procedures.
   9.1. Responsibilities:
       9.1.1. 51 MOS/MXOOA and 51 MOS/MXOOM will use an Aircraft Utilization Report
       (AUR) to reconcile deviations and daily utilization. 51 MOS/MXOOM will correct any
       discrepancies in IMDS.
       9.1.2. Deleted.
