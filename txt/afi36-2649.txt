                                            Chapter 1

                                          OVERVIEW

1.1. Program Description and Purpose. The Air Force Voluntary Education Program supports
Force Development by maintaining a highly educated force. The program supports off-duty
Voluntary Education goals for Regular Air Force, Air National Guard, and Air Force Reserve
Airmen. Voluntary Education supports recruiting efforts as an enticing benefit program and
supports retention as an in-service benefit. It significantly contributes to occupational
competencies, institutional competencies, special interest needs, and readiness by supporting the
current and anticipated needs of the Air Force. Through professional and Voluntary Education,
individuals develop the abilities necessary to operate effectively in dynamic environments.
Education helps develop sound problem-solving abilities that enable Airmen to better define
problems in a complex operational environment. It provides Air Force members a breadth of
knowledge and problem-solving tools that aid in critical thinking, allowing individuals to address
a wide range of problems and weigh alternative solutions. (See Attachment 2 for Voluntary
Education Strategic Plan)
1.2. Air Force Voluntary Education Vision: Voluntary Education programs and expertise
integrated seamlessly into recruitment, retention, readiness, and institutional competencies of the
Air Force.
1.3. Air Force Voluntary Education Mission Statement: To develop resilient Airmen
through off-duty educational opportunities allowing them to cultivate personal and professional
knowledge and prepare for leadership roles.
1.4. Air Force Voluntary Education Goals. Voluntary Education opportunities enable self-
development, improve critical thinking skills, and serve as a recruiting and retention incentive
for military members while strengthening Air Force readiness. Education programs expand
knowledge and increase understanding of the role of aerospace power in fulfilling the Air Force
national security strategy. Education is a critical prerequisite to anticipating and meeting the
challenges of the broad range of military operations in which air and space forces are employed.
Only quality education achieved through professional development can ensure the critical
thought processes necessary for sound decision-making. The overarching goals of the Air Force
Voluntary Education program are:
     1.4.1. Ensure Airmen have off-duty education opportunities that allow them to develop
     personal and professional knowledge desired as an incentive for recruitment, retention, and
     readiness
     1.4.2. Prepare Airmen for leadership and advancement opportunities within the Air Force
     as well as for return to civilian employment after Service
     1.4.3. Develop Airmen occupational and institutional competencies through Higher
     Education Specific goals and their outcomes are outlined in Attachment 2.
1.5. Voluntary Education Program Implementation: The Voluntary Education program is
comprised of four Core Functions that are essential in accomplishing the Mission and reaching
the Vision.
AFI36-2649 1 OCTOBER 2014                                                                      7


  1.5.1. Program Management is the process of ensuring optimal program performance.
  AF/A1DLV establishes Voluntary Education’s vision and mission based on the needs of the
  Air Force and its Airmen. AF/A1DLV provides overarching administrative and managerial
  supervision for all programs aligned under Voluntary Education and works with the
  appropriate partners to provide adequate support for program implementation, staff, facilities,
  and technology. (Specifics on program management are outlined in Chapter 3)
  1.5.2. Counseling refers to the actual advice Voluntary Education professionals provide the
  Airmen and Air Force leaders. At the very heart of Voluntary Education is the Airman. It is
  essential that qualified academic counselors/advisors and specialist knowledgeable in higher
  education work directly with Airmen in developing their academic programs and advising

  deactivation, or assignment departure. It is ultimately the Airman’s responsibility to ensure
  all grades are posted in AFAEMS/AFVEC prior to the deadline. Failure to do so will result
  in a recoupment action (para 6.8.1). Separating Airmen, to include Reserve/Guard Airmen
  nearing deactivation, must provide grades or progress report from instructor stating
  satisfactory progress at least 2 weeks prior to separation/deactivation date. If an
  unsatisfactory grade is reported at the end of the term and after an Airman has left the Air

  a course load in excess of part-time study will result in a financial obligation if Airmen fail to
  complete any or all of the courses. (T-0)
  2.6.6. When considering an academic institution, Airmen must consider the institution’s
  accreditation, policy on transfer credits (into and out of the institution), cost to AF and

     successful progress in their UGT or that the TDY, PCS, or PME attendance (current
     PME guidance advises in-resident students to not enroll in off-duty education because of
     the heavy academic schedule) will not adversely affect successful course completion. (T-

                RESOURCES AND INFRASTRUCTURE MANAGEMENT

5.1. Funding. The Voluntary Education program uses appropriated funds (APF) PEC89732F in
direct support of its mission in accordance with Title 10, United States Code, Section 2007. It
supports MilTA, office materials and supplies, contracted Voluntary Education support,
personnel salaries, travel, per diem, and registration costs for training and professional
development of staff members. This funding is not part of base operating support (BOS) at any
base to include joint bases. It will not be used to fund BA 01 or BA03 activities, personnel, or
NPSCs other than Voluntary Education. (T-1)
5.2. Non-Personal Services Contracts (NPSC). The E&TS Chief may use NPSC for specific
and limited functional services as needed by a specific location in support of the Voluntary
Education program to meet mission requirements (see para 3.1.2). The NPSC may be used for
customer service support, test administrators, academic skills instructors, academic advisors,
classroom monitors, and computer support personnel. The personnel rendering services under
the NPSC may not be subject, either by the terms of the contract or by the manner of
administration, to the supervision and control usually prevailing in relationships between the
Government and its employees. (T-1)
   5.2.1. The MAJCOM must review and approve, prior to submission to the Contracting
   Office, any NPSC requiring funding above $30,000 for part-time work and $60,000 for full-
   time work. All NPSCs must be justified, stating that federal positions are not available to
   perform the services. (T-1)
   5.2.2. A NPSC for academic skills instruction may include instructional costs and course
   material for off-duty classes on a per-course basis, but may not include the purchase of
   hardware or technology equipment. Tutorial services are authorized under academic skills
   instruction when separate courses are not feasible. A minimum of five students must be
   signed up for an academic skills course to be held. Students who register for the course will
   be required to attend all sessions. (T-1)
   5.2.3. NPSCs must be on a fixed or per unit basis. Financial obligation may not extend
   beyond the end of the fiscal year unless provisions were made for extensions. (T-1)
   5.2.4. An NPSC for a test administrator must contain a five (5) appointment per test session
   minimum requirement. MAJCOMs may waive this requirement, if necessary. (T-1)
5.3. Records. AFAEMS is the official automated records system for the Voluntary Education
program. Automated records relating to the Voluntary Education program will be maintained
indefinitely. Hard copy records will be kept in accordance with established guidelines for
records management. (T-1)

     MILITARY TUITION ASSISTANCE (MILTA) PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

6.1. Authority. Title 10, United States Code Sections 2005 and 2007, the Annual
Appropriations Act, DoDD 1322.8E, DoDI 1322.25, and Air Force memoranda authorize
MilTA, waivers, reimbursements, and outline policy.
   6.1.1. The Air Force provides MilTA for the cost of tuition not to exceed $250.00 per
   semester hour (SH) credit and $166.66 per quarter hour (QH) credit, and a fiscal year annual
   MilTA cap of $4,500.00, applicable to all eligible Airmen. Any combined use for Reservists
   of active duty MilTA and Reserve MilTA has an annual cap of $4,500.00; the two funds
   cannot be used to pay for the same course. MilTA for activated Guard and the TA benefit
   offered by the state Air National Guard cannot be used to pay for the same course. (T-0)
   6.1.2. Courses are funded using 1-year funds in PEC89732F based on the term start date.
   MilTA will not be issued earlier than 45 days prior to the term start date. All waiver requests
   for this 45-day rule must be approved by the E&TS Chief or designee. (T-1)
   6.1.3. Airmen must use the electronic degree plan (E-Degree) on the Air Force Virtual
   Education Center (AFVEC). (T-0)
      6.1.3.1. All new degree plan requests occurring on or after 15 Oct 13 must use the e-
      Degree format. MilTA students with legacy degree plans have until 14 Oct 14 to convert
      to the new e-degree plan. Failure to comply with this deadline will result in the denial of
      MilTA until the e-degree is posted in their official AFAEMS record. Any courses taken
      between 14 Oct 14 and the approval and loading of the e-Degree plan using any other
      funding source will not be eligible for retroactive MilTA. (T-1)
      6.1.3.2. Degree plans must be an officially evaluated plan completed by the degree
      granting institution and include ALL transfer credit accepted toward degree completion.
      Transfer work includes but is not limited to academic tests, Community College of the
      Air Force credit, other Air Force training, and courses taken at other academic
      institutions. The e-Degree must include ALL courses required for completion of the
      degree and include the original plan supplied by the institution to the Airman for a single
      degree. Airmen must provide an evaluated degree plan from the academic institution no
      later than after the individual has completed 6 SH (or equivalent) with the institution.
      MilTA will be denied until an evaluated degree plan is received and approved by the
      education center. Courses taken after the completion of 6 semester hours but before the
      approval of the e-Degree for which airmen use any other funding source will not be
      eligible for retroactive TA. The evaluated plan must be uploaded to the Airman’s
      AFAEMS file before additional MilTA will be provided. Any changes to the plan after
      approval may result in denial of MilTA until a new plan is submitted and approved. Any
      courses taken during the denial period using any other funding source will not be eligible
      for retroactive MilTA. (T-0)
   6.1.4. MilTA will be reimbursed for unsatisfactory or missing grades. Unsatisfactory grades
   are a “D” and below for undergraduate courses and a “C” or below for graduate courses.
   Missing grades are grades not received and updated in official student education records by
 20                                                            AFI36-2649 1 OCTOBER 2014


   the 60th day after the end of the term on the approved MilTA request (AF Form 1227,
   Authority for Tuition Assistance). (T-0)
       6.1.4.1. Airmen will have no more than 30 calendar days to respond to the notification of
       reimbursement (para 6.8) to contact their academic institution to address final grade
       discrepancies. Airmen are ultimately responsible for ensuring grades are in their
       AFAEMS education record by required deadlines. After 30 days an automatic payroll
       deduction will be initiated. Refunds will not be given to students for grades changed from
       unsatisfactory/missing to satisfactory/updated after the 30 days have passed. (T-1)
       6.1.4.2. Airmen receiving incomplete/“I” grades must attain a satisfactory grade within
       the time limit stipulated by the institution or 120 calendar days after the end of the term
       as listed on the AF Form 1227, whichever comes first. At the end of this period, refund
       action will be initiated if a satisfactory grade has not been received. Should an Airman
       present a grade after the deadline, TA money will not be returned to the Airman since
       he/she failed to meet the completion requirements and recoupment action will not be
       stopped or suspended. (see paras 6.5.18 or 6.8.4) (T-0)
   6.1.5. Execution of all financial actions associated with the MilTA program are centralized
   at the CO. In conjunction with the base education centers, the CO will mediate MilTA
   conflict resolution. (T-1)
   6.1.6. All actions relating to MilTA approval/denial, waivers/reimbursements will be
   annotated in the student’s AFAEMS record by the CO and education center. (T-1)
6.1.7. Airmen who do not maintain a cumulative undergraduate GPA of 2.0 or higher at the
undergraduate level after completing 15 semester hours or equivalent will not be authorized
MilTA until they raise their GPA to the required level. For graduate-level courses, the member
must maintain a GPA of 3.0 or higher on a 4.0 grading scale after completing 6 semester hours or
equivalent. To compute GPA, the E&TS will use all grades funded with MilTA regardless of
reimbursement actions. MilTA is not authorized to allow a member to raise their GPA; it is
incumbent upon the member to fund and provide official grades to E&TS verifying GPA
increase. The Air Force will not reimburse a student for course(s) taken at a student’s own
expense or using any other funding source to raise his/her GPA. (Exception: If a student falls
below the minimum GPA, then courses paid using other funding sources since starting to use
MilTA in order to meet minimum GPA requirement will be used to compute the new GPA.) (T-
0)

6.2. Airmen Eligibility. The Air Force provides MilTA when term dates fall within an
Airman’s dates of activation, for the following active duty and activated/mobilized Air Reserve
Component (ARC) personnel with an approved e-Degree (see para 6.1.3) in the Air Force

  6.2.3. RegAF officers on active duty must have a date of separation (DOS) or deactivation
  date that is 2-years or more after the end of the term date. (See para 6.2.6 for Active Duty
  Service Commitment (ADSC) for activated Reserve officers). Officers unable to meet this
  requirement will not be authorized MilTA. Officers eligible to receive MilTA will incur a 2-
  year ADSC. ADSCs are computed based on the term end date reflected on the AF Form
  1227. Officers are subject to recoupment action on remaining ADSC if they should
  separate/retire before the ADSC is completed. (T-0)
  6.2.4. RegAF Officer Active Duty Service Commitment (ADSC) waiver requests will be

  courses for which MilTA was used. A signed Reserve Commitment (RSC) contract
  reflecting the 4-year ADSC will be uploaded into AFAEMS prior to issuing MilTA. MilTA
  request for activated Reserve officers will be routed first to ARPC for validation of the active
  duty service commitment before going to the active duty supervisor for final approval. (T-0)
  6.2.8. Airmen who have an Unfavorable Information file (UIF), are on a control roster, have
  failed their most recent Physical Fitness test or are overdue, and/or have a current referral
  EPR/OPR at the time of application for MilTA are ineligible for MilTA. There are no
  waivers. Airmen who are denied MilTA and use other means to fund courses are not eligible
  for retroactive MilTA for those courses after the removal of the above barriers. All other
  eligibility requirements apply in order for the Airmen to resume receiving MilTA. (T-1)
  6.2.9. Supervisors (see paras 2.6.7.1, 2.6.7.2, 2.6.7.3, and 2.6.7.4) must approve or

   may be approved only if the circumstances clearly show the events were beyond the control
   of the student and that the airmen made every effort to work with the institution and
   education center to resolve prior to requesting a waiver. Circumstances that   may     be
   considered for a waiver are: short notice TDYs where the Airmen had no prior knowledge;
   short notice PCS where the Airmen had no prior knowledge; unexpected hospitalization; or
   emergency leave. (T-0)
   6.9.2. All waiver requests must be accompanied by a letter signed by the Squadron
   Commander/Director/First Sergeant. (T-1)

   All decisions are final. Airmen may appeal the CO decision to AF/A1DL. (T-1)
6.10. Refund to student: Two specific circumstances require that the government refund the
student after reimbursement action: school refund or administrative error. A student is refunded
if a reimbursement action against an Airmen has been initiated after which the Academic
Institution refunds any portion of the MilTA payment to the AF. In the case of partial refunds by
the institution, the airmen is still responsible for the remaining amount. This refund will be
processed after the credit is received via GPC or check by the CO. Secondly, a student is
refunded if an administrative error occurred, such as a duplication of debt or proof of
government mistake with grade postings. However, all collections based on para 6.8 are final
and not refunded. (T-1)
   6.10.1. After the entire collection is completed, or refund received, an SF1034, Public
   Voucher for Purchases and Services Other Than Personal, and supporting documentation will
   be sent to DFAS to initiate refund. This process takes 4-6 weeks and the amount will be
   directly refunded to Airman’s banking account of record. (T-1)

                                 COUNSELING SERVICES

8.1. Program Description: Education and career counseling are core processes and are the
foundation for identifying, acquiring, and delivering high-quality, deliberate, adult education
programs and services. As financial and development stewards for the Air Force’s most critical
asset - its airmen - the E&TS Chief, Education Services Specialists (ESS), and Counselors are
responsible for assisting airmen from the time they enter military service until the time they
separate or retire. They accomplish this by establishing realistic and timely short- and long-term
educational and vocational goals, identifying challenges to goal attainment, and providing
periodic follow-up.
8.2. Requirements
   8.2.1. The E&TS Chief will ensure academic and career counseling, to include MilTA and
   degree program guidance, are conducted by staff who are professionally qualified in
   accordance with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) qualification standards for the
   Education Services, 1740 Education Series and/or formally trained in the specific program of
   advisement. (T-0)
   8.2.2. The E&TS staff will maintain comprehensive records in AFAEMS to include, but not
   limited to: initial and subsequent counseling sessions; reviewing, approving and uploading
   degree/education plans; performing CCAF action requests; updating enlisted education
   levels; annotating routine inquiries and referrals. (T-1)
8.3. Core Counseling Functions: Counseling and advising include providing information and
analysis of students’ academic goals, and offering options to successfully meet those goals.
Education specialists and counselors must be knowledgeable about all levels of post-secondary
education in order to guide undergraduate and graduate students (See Attachment 4). This is
accomplished through the following:
   8.3.1. Provide information, resources, and analysis to Airmen ranging from basic
   information such as credit hour, accreditation, and available programs to more advanced
   guidance to include assessments of interest and long term goals, and preparing for post active
   duty careers (T-0)
   8.3.2 The counseling checklist at Attachment 4 is mandatory and will be used for all
   Airmen receiving counseling for the first time or for Airmen who have been inactive in
   pursuing their education for a year or more. (T-1)
   8.3.3. Counsel Airmen on CCAF opportunities. This includes, but is not limited to, course
   completion requirements, transcript reviews, and follow up actions. Will at least annually
   review Advanced Academic Standing reports to encourage Airmen to complete remaining
   CCAF requirements. All sessions must be documented in AFAEMS. (T-1)
   8.3.4. The E&TS will not organize or conduct graduation ceremonies including Community
   College of the Air Force (CCAF). (T-1)
   8.3.5. Provide advice, guidance, and counseling to Airmen on MilTA benefits, processes,and
   requirements. This includes, but is not limited to, information about student and school
   eligibility, completion requirements, active duty service commitments, reimbursement

   procedures, waiver packages, and finance options for Airmen who are not eligible to receive
   MilTA. (T-0)
   8.3.6. Serve as the liaison between the Airman and the CO. (T-1)
8.4. DoD Transition – Goals, Plans, Success (T-GPS) / Higher Education Track: T-GPS is
a 5-day workshop with a supplemental 2-day Higher Education track if required. Eligible
Service Members seeking higher education when they depart from military service shall show
documented evidence that they have completed standardized individual assessment tool,
completed comparison of higher education options, completed application or received
acceptance letter from a higher education institution and confirmed one-on-one counseling with a
higher education advisor via telephone, e-mail, or letter. (T-0)
   8.4.1. Teach the 2-day Accessing Higher Education Track, which is designed to prepare
   Airmen for college life. At Joint Bases, T-GPS Higher Education Track instruction is
   provided by the lead service. (T-0)
   8.4.2. Accessing Higher Education Track instruction will follow the approved DoD
   curriculum to include researching schools, financial assistance, risks associated with
   incurring debt to finance an education, and the realities of campus life as well as completing
   college applications and transferring credits. (T-0)
   8.4.3. Information concerning VA education benefits will be provided by a VA
   representative. (T-0)
   8.4.4. Update required databases and follow up with attendees as required. (T-0)
8.5. Education and Employment Initiative (E2I) and Operation WARFIGHTER
(OWF). Recently, DoD published DoDI 1300.25 Guidance for the Education and Employment
Initiative (E2I) and Operation WARFIGHTER (OWF). These provide an avenue that ensures
wounded service members (aka Recovering Service Members (RSMs)) are provided with sound
education and employment assistance as they transition to civilian life. (T-0)
   8.5.1. The VA is primary lead on these initiatives. (T-0)
   8.5.2. The VA has VR&E (Vocational, Rehabilitation, and Employment) counselors either at
   the installation or in a regional office who will work to establish the service member’s
   eligibility and begin the process of establishing a case. (T-0)
   8.5.3. AFPC/DPFW (Wounded Warrior Branch) personnel will work with the VA and base-
   level case managers. (T-0)
   8.5.4. Once an Airman is assigned to a base or identified at their current location, the case
   manager will develop a program that meets the needs and interests of the Airmen. (T-0)
   8.5.5. Education centers may be contacted to work with the Airmen to meet their educational
   goals. This could be individually or as part of an ad hoc committee. (T-0)
   8.5.6. Airmen identified for this program will have a special identifier in AFAEMS (E2I or
   OWF drop down) so that counseling notes can be listed under the correct program for
   tracking purposes. This has high-level visibility; therefore, it is crucial that the appropriate
   drop down choice is selected for these Airmen in AFAEMS. (T-0)

8.6. Non-core Tasks. Due to years of personnel reductions due in part to RMD 703, PBD 720,
A-76 initiatives, etc. the Voluntary Education program has undergone a complete review of core
and non-core functions. Non-core tasks are those tasks/programs that will no longer be
performed by the education center. The non-core tasks were approved by MAJCOM A1s and
Air Staff during the development of the Voluntary Education Programs and Military Tuition
Assistance Centralization. The noncore tasks the E&TS will no longer support due to the
reductions are listed at Attachment 9. (T-1)

       completed using ResTA funds. The RSC time begins on the course end date for each
       course. For example, an officer completes graduate course (A) on 15 Oct 2013. The
       officer now has a RSC through 14 Oct 2017. The same officer takes another course (B)
       that ends 15 Dec 2013. The officer now has two RSC’s. The RSC for course (A) has 47
       months remaining while the RSC for course (B) starts the full 48 months. NOTE: Each
       time an officer applies for ResTA, he/she must sign a contract for Air Force selected RSC
       with the Wing Education and Training Section (E&TS) or ARPC/DPTTE. (T-0)
9.3. ResTA Split Training Option

   9.5.15. Deny ResTA when an Airman is not maintaining acceptable academic progress.
   Airmen who do not maintain a cumulative undergraduate GPA of 2.0 or higher at the

   Airman must maintain a GPA of 3.0 or higher on a 4.0 grading scale after completing 6
   semester hours or equivalent. To compute GPA, the E&TS will use all grades funded with
   ResTA regardless of recoupment actions. ResTA is not authorized to allow a member to raise
   their GPA; it is incumbent upon the member to fund and provide official grades to E&TS
   verifying GPA increase. The Air Force Reserve will not reimburse a student for course(s)
   taken at a student’s own expense to raise a GPA. (If a student’s GPA falls below the
   minimum standard then courses paid using other funding sources since starting ResTA to
   increase the GPA to the minimum standard will be used to compute the new GPA). (T-0)
9.6. ResTA Supervisor Responsibilities.
   9.6.1. For the purposes of ResTA, a supervisor is defined as the person in the member’s
   chain of command having next in line TA approval authority and oversight. This person must

   otherwise, recoupment action will take place. A successful course completion is defined as a
   grade of “C” or higher for undergraduate courses, a “B” or higher for graduate courses, and a
   “P” (or equivalent) for “Pass/Fail” grades. (T-0)

   AFAEMS via the AFVEC within 60 days of term end date or 2 weeks prior to separation or
   terminal leave (whichever occurs first), retirement, deactivation, or assignment departure.
   This includes Airmen on an educational deferment. It is ultimately the Airman’s
   responsibility to ensure all grades are posted in AFAEMS prior to the deadline. Failure to do
   so will result in a recoupment action. Separating Airmen and Airmen nearing deactivation
   must provide grade or progress report from instructor stating satisfactory progress at least 2
   weeks prior to separation/deactivation date. If an unsatisfactory grade is reported at the end
   of the term, an out of service debt will be processed. The debt will be processed through HQ
   ARPC/DPPTE with HQ AFRC/FM guidance. (T-0)
   9.7.10. For Incomplete (and equivalent) grades: Airmen receiving incomplete/I" grades must
   attain a satisfactory grade within the time limit stipulated by the institution or 120 calendar
   days after the end of the term, whichever comes first. Extensions will not be granted. At the
   end of this period, refund action will be initiated by the CO if a satisfactory grade has not
   been received. If the Airman presents a grade after the deadline, the funds collected will not

              AIR FORCE VOLUNTARY EDUCATION STRATEGIC PLAN

1   Introduction
The Air Force Voluntary Education Program supports Force Development by maintaining a highly
educated force. The program supports off-duty Voluntary Education goals for Regular Air Force,
Air National Guard, and Air Force Reserve Airmen. Voluntary Education supports recruiting efforts
as an enticing benefit program and supports retention as an in-Service benefit. It significantly
contributes to occupational competencies, institutional competencies, special interest needs, and
readiness by supporting the current and anticipated needs of the Air Force. Through professional and
Voluntary Education, individuals develop the abilities necessary to operate effectively in dynamic
environments. Education helps develop sound problem-solving abilities that enable Airmen to better
define problems in a complex operational environment. It provides Air Force members a breadth of
knowledge and problem-solving tools that aid in critical thinking, allowing individuals to address a
wide range of problems and weigh alternative solutions.

Voluntary Education opportunities enable self-development, improve critical thinking skills, and
serve as a recruiting and retention incentive for military members while strengthening Air Force
readiness. Education programs expand knowledge and increase understanding of the role of
aerospace power in fulfilling the Air Force national security strategy. Education is a critical
prerequisite to anticipating and meeting the challenges of the broad range of military operations in
which air and space forces are employed. Only quality education achieved through professional
development can ensure the critical thought processes necessary for sound decision-making.

There are three sections to the construct of this
strategic plan (Figure 1). (1) The Voluntary
Education program’s Vision and Mission; (2) The
Core Functions of the Voluntary Education
program; and (3) The Strategic Roadmap. The
Vision and Mission are the foundation and
guiding compass of Voluntary Education; the
Core Functions are the Voluntary Education
activities performed; and the Strategic Roadmap
is the vehicle for success. The Strategic Roadmap
ensures the successful performance of the Core
Functions and the alignment of AF/A1DLV
efforts with the greater Air Force and the Deputy
Chief of Staff, Manpower, Personnel & Services (AF/A1) missions and priorities. The Strategic
Roadmap consists of four focus areas, the Priorities, which are to:

    (1) Strengthen Voluntary Education through robust capabilities, solid partnerships, and
        continuous innovation;
    (2) Oversee the prudent management of Voluntary Education resources;
    (3) Enhance Professional Development for the Voluntary Education Functional Community;
    (4) Maintain current, relevant, and comprehensive policy.

These priorities help guide the Air Force Voluntary Education Office (AF/A1DLV) efforts to ensure
the program makes sufficient progress toward meeting its mission.

2     Vision and Mission

The Vision and Mission (Figure 2), which are the
foundation and guiding principles of the
Voluntary Education program, can be thought of
as the where and what of Voluntary Education.
The Vision is where AF/A1DLV wants Voluntary
Education to be in the next five years and the
Mission is what AF/A1DLV wants Voluntary
Education to do in the next five years. Given that
the Vision and Mission are the where and
what, then the Airmen and the Air Force
are the why. Voluntary Education is a vital
mechanism for strengthening and developing the
Airmen and the Air Force; by achieving the
mission and reaching the vision it will remains so.

3     Core Functions
The Voluntary Education program is comprised of four Core
Functions (Figure 3) that are essential in accomplishing the Mission
and reaching the Vision. Program Management is the process of
ensuring optimal program performance. AF/A1DLV establishes
Voluntary Education’s vision and mission based on the needs of the
Air Force and its Airmen. AF/A1DLV provides administrative and
managerial supervision for all programs aligned under Voluntary
Education and provide adequate support for program implementation,
staff facilities, and technology. Counseling refers to the actual
advice Voluntary Education professionals provide the Airmen. At
the very heart of Voluntary Education is the Airman. AF/A1DLV
takes great pride in assisting Airmen in developing their academic
programs and advises them on financial aid, academic programs, and
Air Force Specific programs like the Community College of the Air
Force (CCAF). Voluntary Education exists to aid Airmen in reaching
their professional and personal development goals. Testing refers to both academic testing as well as
military testing. The Voluntary Education Program oversees for-credit testing, admission testing,
language testing, promotion testing, and Professional Military Education (PME) testing. Military
Tuition Assistance (MIL-TA) refers to the Tuition Assistance program. Since it is such a vital and
integral aspect of Voluntary Education, it merits being separated as a unique Core Function rather
than being encompassed under Program Management. AF/A1DLV advocates for Tuition Assistance
funds and oversee the appropriation and execution of those funds.
AFI36-2649 1 OCTOBER 2014                                                                           47


4   Strategic Roadmap
Voluntary Education’s Strategic
Roadmap (Figure 4) is a top-down
driven process for achieving optimal
performance of the Core Functions
and aligning Voluntary Education
with the greater Air Force and
AF/A1 missions and priorities and is
the pathway for reaching the end-
state. The Strategic Roadmap can
be viewed as a “goal-oriented
hierarchy” consisting of three levels
– beginning with the Priorities (the
top level), becoming more granular
with the Goals (the middle level),
which are further refined with
Objectives (the bottom level). The Priorities are broad guiding points, each focusing on different
“themes”, that collectively ensure the Core Functions are performed at maximum benefit to the
Airmen and Air Force. Aligned under each Priority is a subset of Goals. Each Goal is more specific
than the Priority which it is aligned under, focusing on a particular area. In order to achieve a
Priority all Goals which are aligned under it must first be achieved. Similarly, each Goal is
supported by a subset of Objectives that must first be accomplished in order to achieve their
respective goal. Thus, moving from the bottom up – Objectives are stepping-stones to achieve Goals
and Goals are stepping-stones to achieve Priorities. In other words, the end state of the roadmap is to
achieve the priorities, but the avenue to achieve them begins at the bottom by achieving the
objectives and moving upward. Figure 4 shows how the Strategic Roadmap is top down driven while
achievement is attained from the bottom up.

4.1 Priority 1: Strengthen Voluntary Education through robust capabilities, solid
    partnerships, and continuous innovation.

5     Summary
The Air Force Voluntary Education Program will face challenges over the next few years, such as
shrinking budgets and reduced manpower with growing requirements. Voluntary education’s
mission is “To develop resilient Airmen through off-duty educational opportunities allowing them to
cultivate personal and professional knowledge and prepare for leadership roles.” This Strategic Plan
lays out how AF/A1DLV will navigate through the challenges and continue to develop the world’s
best Airmen and strengthen the Air Force through Voluntary Education in the most effective and
efficient way.

   is reported that the student earned an “I”, “D” or below for undergraduate, “C” or below for
   graduate, “W”, or “U.” AFAEMS will generate an email with reimbursement action
   information and suspense to the students. If action has not been taken by the 31st day, a DD
   Form 139 will be processed for a lump sum payment. The CO will submit a CMS request to
   initiate the deduction of the student reimbursement amount from the student’s military pay.
   (T-0)

   and have exhausted all administrative options, he/she can exercise the option to submit a DD
   Form 149, Correction of Military Record. AF/A1DL is the office with the primary
   responsibility to provide an advisory recommendation to the Board. Students should be
   aware that courses taken via distance learning with the increased flexibility will be less likely
   to receive a waiver. See para 6.9.1 (T-0)
A5.2. The following information is provided for use by the student:
   A5.2.1. All waiver requests must be accompanied by a letter signed by the Squadron

           NON-CORE FUNCTIONS DELETED FROM VOL ED PROGRAM

A9.1. Troops-to-Teachers (TTT): Established as a DoD program managed by the Defense
Activity for Non-Traditional Education Support (DANTES), TTT assists eligible military
personnel transition to a new career as public school teachers in “high need” schools. State
supported offices were established to provide information on teacher credential requirements.
A9.2. Military Spouse Education Assistance/Spouse TA/MyCAA: Spouse tuition assistance
programs provide financial aid to spouses continuing their education. Lead agencies for these
programs include Airmen and Family Readiness Centers, Air Force Aid Society, and Department
of Labor. Applications are accessible online.
A9.3. Education Grants/AAS Vo-Tech Loan Program: These federal financial aid programs
are administered through external agencies. With current technology, the E&TS no longer has
an active role in these programs.
A9.4. Voluntary Education Program Plan (VEPP): The VEPP is a detailed plan to align the
needs of the base with available educational programs.
A9.5. CCAF Graduation Ceremonies: AFI 36-2648, Community College of the Air Force,
states diplomas are to be presented in an “appropriate” ceremony. E&TS will no longer organize
a base-wide event.
A9.6. VA Counseling/National Call to Service/Enlisted College Loan Repayment
Program: National Call to Service (no longer an active program) and the College Loan
Repayment Program are military enlistment incentives administered by AFPC. The GI Bill is
administered by the Veterans’ Administration (VA). AFPC maintains a VA liaison office to
address GI Bill concerns. The VA maintains a website with detailed information on all
programs.
A9.7. Outreach Programs/Marketing: E&TS will only provide marketing/outreach when
manpower allows.
A9.8. Distance Learning Proctored Exams: E&TS will no longer administer civilian college
distance learning exams. DOD Instruction 1322.25, Voluntary Education Programs, attachment
Enclosure 3 directs civilian colleges to “assume responsibility for the administration and
proctoring of all course examinations not normally administered and proctored within the
traditional classroom setting.” FSDE will refer students to their academic institution
liaisons/advisors for test administration arrangements
A9.9. Base Education Planning and Advisory Committee (BEPAC): The purpose of the
BEPAC was to provide a formal venue for leadership and subject matter experts to devise
solutions to education program issues, such as classroom space, building repairs, etc. It also
served as the “eyes and ears” for the Installation Commander on Voluntary Education matters.
Meeting minutes were often staffed at the Wing level for approval. BEPAC will no longer be
mandated.
A9.10. PME Seminars: E&TS will refer students to the respective school for guidance for
establishing a local study group/seminar.
AFI36-2649 1 OCTOBER 2014                                                             63


A9.11. Civilian Tuition Assistance (Civ TA): In 1997 the Air Force established the Civ TA
program under the auspices of AFI 36-401, Civilian Training Program. Civ TA programs are
MAJCOM-unique and not an AF-wide supported program. Therefore, the E&TS can no longer
support this program unless a Civilian Training position is assigned to E&TS.
A9.12. Commissioning: Education Centers will no longer be involved in the development or
review of commissioning packages for any programs.

Figure A10.1. SAMPLE Memorandum of Understanding
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING FOR BASE EDUCATION
SERVICES

BETWEEN

THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE
XXXXXX AIR FORCE BASE, XXXX

AND

XXXXXXXXX UNIVERSITY

This Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is between:

United States Air Force, [Wing Designation]
Street Address
City, State

and

XXXXX University
Street Address
City, State

It provides guidelines and procedures for the delivery of educational services on XXXX AFB not
covered in the DoD Voluntary Education Partnership Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
between the DoD Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness and the
Institution or the Air Force Addendum to the DoD MOU. This provides educational
opportunities for service members, Department of Defense (DoD) civilian employees, eligible
adult family members, military retirees, and non-DoD personnel. This MOU is not to be
construed in any way as giving rise to a contractual obligation of the Air Force to provide funds
to the Institution that would be contrary to federal law.


1. PREAMBLE

Providing access to quality postsecondary education opportunities is a strategic investment that
enhances the service member’s ability to support mission accomplishment and successfully
AFI36-2649 1 OCTOBER 2014                                                                          65


return to civilian life. Today’s fast-paced and highly mobile environment, where frequent
deployments and mobilizations are required to support the nation’s policies and objectives,
requires the Air Force to sponsor postsecondary educational programs using a variety of learning
modalities that include instructor-led courses, as well as distance learning (DL) options. All are
designed to support the professional and personal development and progress of Air Force
members and the DoD civilian workforce. XXXX University has become a partner in this
objective by making its programs available for use in connection with the Air Force Voluntary
Education program.

The requirement and authority for this MOU rests in Air Force Instruction 36-2649 and within
DoD Instruction (DODI) 1322.25 and DODI 1322.08E. All parties desire to satisfy the
educational interests and needs of the individual Airmen, as well as the needs of the Air Force.

This MOU is subject at all times to federal law and the rules, guidelines, and regulations of the
DoD. Any conflicts between this MOU and such federal law, rules, guidelines, and regulations
will be resolved in favor of the federal law, rules, guidelines, or regulations.

commander. Access once provided may be revoked at any time due to military necessity or
conduct that violates base rules or policies.

     (3) Active duty military students will be afforded registration and class placement priority.
Additional class sections may be added to accommodate an overflow of military students.
Paragraph 5.a.(4) of the DoD Voluntary Education Partnership MOU will apply.

been identified for termination. Each student will be individually counseled and provided a
personalized plan for completing remaining degree requirements.

       (10) The Institution will agree to release and waive all claims against the United States, its
agents, officers, and employees arising out of the use of Air Force facilities, equipment, supplies,
and services by the Institution, its officers, representatives, agents, employees, and non-DoD
affiliated students. The Institution further agrees to defend, pay, or settle all claims arising out of
the use of base facilities based upon the negligence, gross negligence, or willful misconduct of
its agents, representatives, officers, employees, and non-DoD affiliated students. The Institution
will hold the U.S. Government harmless from any claims arising out of acts or omissions of the
Institution, its agents, representatives, officers, employees, and non-DoD affiliated students.

     (11) This MOU, in conjunction with the DoD Voluntary Education Partnership MOU, and
the Air Force Addendum for Education Services between XXXXXX University and the U.S. Air
Force, defines the entire relationship between the Air Force and the Institution and supersedes
any previous verbal or written agreements of understanding. Failure on the part of any party to
comply with the provisions of these MOUs may result in the termination of the Institution’s
programs on the base. No change or modification of this MOU shall be valid unless or until it is
in writing and signed by both parties.

     (12) Tuition charges by XXXXXX University for academic programs are specified in
Attachment 2. A minimum of 90 days’ notice will be provided to E&TS Chief prior to any
intended changes to these rates by the institution. The institution will waive all computer

Drop Requests

Students may drop a course, with no notation of course enrollment on their transcripts, during the drop period only.
Due to compressed term schedules at Worldwide locations, the drop period extends through the first week of each
term.

"Late Drop" Requests

Personnel covered under this section of the curriculum standards manual are uniformed members of the U.S. Armed
Forces who are registered or enrolled in a class at XXXX University and who must drop a class due to military
deployment or official military travel. A "late drop" will be considered for military personnel who receive a "short"
notice of military deployment or "short" notice of official military travel, preventing continued enrollment in a class.
Eligible students may request a "late drop" if ALL of the following criteria have been met:

A. The military student is notified of travel after the end-date of the scheduled drop/add period for a given class.

B. The student is unable to complete the class due to the deployment/travel.

C. The military student submits signed and official deployment or travel orders dated after the drop/add period end
date for a given class. A student also may submit a letter from the student's military command stating that the

                           ESTABLISHING PRINCIPLES OF EXCELLENCE FOR EDUCATIONAL
                          INSTITUTIONS SERVING SERVICE MEMBERS, VETERANS, SPOUSES,
                                         AND OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to
ensure that Federal military and veterans educational benefits programs are providing service members, veterans, spouses, and
other family members with the information, support, and protections they deserve, it is hereby ordered as follows:

Section 1. Policy. The original GI Bill, approved just weeks after D-Day, educated nearly 8 million Americans and helped
transform this Nation. We owe the same obligations to this generation of service men and women as was afforded that previous
one. This is the promise of the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008 (title V, Public Law 110-252) (Post-9/11
GI Bill) and the continued provision of educational benefits in the Department of Defense's Tuition Assistance Program (10
U.S.C. 2007): to provide our service members, veterans, spouses, and other family members the opportunity to pursue a high-
quality education and gain the skills and training they need to fill the jobs of tomorrow.

Since the Post-9/11 GI Bill became law, there have been reports of aggressive and deceptive targeting of service members,
veterans, and their families by some educational institutions. For example, some institutions have recruited veterans with serious
brain injuries and emotional vulnerabilities without providing academic support and counseling; encouraged service members
and veterans to take out costly institutional loans rather than encouraging them to apply for Federal student loans first; engaged in
misleading recruiting practices on military installations; and failed to disclose meaningful information that allows potential
students to determine whether the institution has a good record of graduating service members, veterans, and their families and
positioning them for success in the workforce.

To ensure our service members, veterans, spouses, and other family members have the information they need to make informed
decisions concerning their well-earned Federal military and veterans educational benefits, I am directing my Administration to
develop Principles of Excellence to strengthen oversight, enforcement, and accountability within these benefits programs.

Sec. 2. Principles of Excellence for Educational Institutions Serving Service Members, Veterans, Spouses, and Other Family
Members. The Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Education shall establish Principles of Excellence (Principles) to
apply to educational institutions receiving funding from Federal military and veterans educational benefits programs, including
benefits programs provided by the Post-9/11 GI Bill and the Tuition Assistance Program. The Principles should ensure that these
educational institutions provide meaningful information to service members, veterans, spouses, and other family members about
the financial cost and quality of educational institutions to assist those prospective students in making choices about how to use
their Federal educational benefits; prevent abusive and deceptive recruiting practices that target the recipients of Federal military
and veterans educational benefits; and ensure that educational institutions provide high-quality academic and student support
services to active-duty service members, reservists, members of the National Guard, veterans, and military families.

To the extent permitted by law, the Principles, implemented pursuant to section 3 of this order, should require educational
institutions receiving funding pursuant to Federal military and veterans educational benefits to:

(a) prior to enrollment, provide prospective students who are eligible to receive Federal military and veterans educational benefits
with a personalized and standardized form, as developed in a manner set forth by the Secretary of Education, working with the
Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs, to help those prospective students understand the total cost of the educational
program, including tuition and fees; the amount of that cost that will be covered by Federal educational benefits; the type and
amount of financial aid they may qualify for; their estimated student loan debt upon graduation; information about student
outcomes; and other information to facilitate comparison of aid packages offered by different educational institutions;

(b) inform students who are eligible to receive Federal military and veterans educational benefits of the availability of Federal
financial aid and have in place policies to alert those students of their potential eligibility for that aid before packaging or
 74                                                                                    AFI36-2649 1 OCTOBER 2014

arranging private student loans or alternative financing programs;

(c) end fraudulent and unduly aggressive recruiting techniques on and off military installations, as well as misrepresentation,
payment of incentive compensation, and failure to meet State authorization requirements, consistent with the regulations issued
by the Department of Education (34 C.F.R. 668.71-668.75, 668.14, and 600.9);

(d) obtain the approval of the institution's accrediting agency for new course or program offerings before enrolling students in
such courses or programs, provided that such approval is appropriate under the substantive change requirements of the
accrediting agency;

(e) allow service members and reservists to be readmitted to a program if they are temporarily unable to attend class or have to
suspend their studies due to service requirements, and take additional steps to accommodate short absences due to service
obligations, provided that satisfactory academic progress is being made by the service members and reservists prior to suspending
their studies;

(f) agree to an institutional refund policy that is aligned with the refund of unearned student aid rules applicable to Federal
student aid provided through the Department of Education under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as required under
section 484B of that Act when students withdraw prior to course completion;

(g) provide educational plans for all individuals using Federal military and veterans educational benefits that detail how they will
fulfill all the requirements necessary to graduate and the expected timeline of completion; and

(h) designate a point of contact for academic and financial advising (including access to disability counseling) to assist service
member and veteran students and their families with the successful completion of their studies and with their job searches.

Sec. 3. Implementation of the Principles of Excellence.
(a) The Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs shall reflect the Principles described in section 2 of this order in new
agreements with educational institutions, to the extent practicable and permitted by law, concerning participation in the Yellow
Ribbon Program for veterans under the Post-9/11 GI Bill or the Tuition Assistance Program for active duty service members. The
Department of Veterans Affairs shall also notify all institutions participating in the Post-9/11 GI Bill program that they are
strongly encouraged to comply with the Principles and shall post on the Department's website those that do.

(b) The Secretaries of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Education, in consultation with the Director of the Bureau of Consumer
Financial Protection (CFPB) and the Attorney General, shall take immediate action to implement this order, and, within 90 days
from the date of this order, report to the President their progress on implementation, including promptly revising regulations,
Department of Defense Instructions, guidance documents, Memoranda of Understanding, and other policies governing programs
authorized or funded by the Post-9/11 GI Bill and the Tuition Assistance Program to implement the Principles, to the extent
permitted by law.

(c) The Secretaries of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Education shall develop a comprehensive strategy for developing service
member and veteran student outcome measures that are comparable, to the maximum extent practicable, across Federal military
and veterans educational benefit programs, including, but not limited to, the Post-9/11 GI Bill and the Tuition Assistance
Program. To the extent practicable, the student outcome measures should rely on existing administrative data to minimize the
reporting burden on institutions participating in these benefit programs. The student outcome measures should permit
comparisons across Federal educational programs and across institutions and types of institutions. The Secretary of Education, in
consultation with the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs, shall also collect from educational institutions, as part of the
Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System and other data collection systems, information on the amount of funding
received pursuant to the Post-9/11 GI Bill and the Tuition Assistance Program. The Secretary of Education shall make this
information publicly available on the College Navigator Website.

(d) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in consultation with the Secretaries of Defense and Education, shall provide to prospective
military and veteran students, prior to using their benefits, streamlined tools to compare educational institutions using key
measures of affordability and value through the Department of Veterans Affairs' eBenefits portal. The eBenefits portal shall be
updated to facilitate access to school performance information, consumer protection information, and key Federal financial aid
documents. The Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs shall also ensure that service members and veterans have access to
that information through educational counseling offered by those Departments.

Sec. 4. Strengthening Enforcement and Compliance Mechanisms. Service members, veterans, spouses, and other family members
AFI36-2649 1 OCTOBER 2014                                                                                                            75

should have access to a strong enforcement system through which to file complaints when institutions fail to follow the
Principles. Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs, in consultation with the
Secretary of Education and the Director of the CFPB, as well as with the Attorney General, as appropriate, shall submit to the
President a plan to strengthen enforcement and compliance mechanisms. The plan shall include proposals to:

(a) create a centralized complaint system for students receiving Federal military and veterans educational benefits to register
complaints that can be tracked and responded to by the Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Justice, and Education, the
CFPB, and other relevant agencies;

(b) institute uniform procedures for receiving and processing complaints across the State Approving Agencies (SAAs) that work
with the Department of Veterans Affairs to review participating institutions, provide a coordinated mechanism across SAAs to
alert the Department of Veterans Affairs to any complaints that have been registered at the State level, and create procedures for
sharing information about complaints with the appropriate State officials, accrediting agency representatives, and the Secretary of
Education;

(c) institute uniform procedures for referring potential matters for civil or criminal enforcement to the Department of Justice and
other relevant agencies;

(d) establish procedures for targeted risk-based program reviews of institutions to ensure compliance with the Principles;

(e) establish new uniform rules and strengthen existing procedures for access to military installations by educational institutions.
These new rules should ensure, at a minimum, that only those institutions that enter into a memorandum of agreement pursuant to
section 3(a) of this order are permitted entry onto a Federal military installation for the purposes of recruitment. The Department
of Defense shall include specific steps for instructing installation commanders on commercial solicitation rules and the
requirement of the Principles outlined in section 2(c) of this order; and

(f) take all appropriate steps to ensure that websites and programs are not deceptively and fraudulently marketing educational
services and benefits to program beneficiaries, including initiating a process to protect the term "GI Bill" and other military or
veterans-related terms as trademarks, as appropriate.

Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of
appropriations.

(b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:

(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or

(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
proposals.

(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in
equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other
person.

       Veterans Educational Assistance Program (VEAP). Airmen (VEAP-era) who did not
       open VEAP accounts may be eligible for benefits based on qualifying active duty service
       under the Post-9/11 GI Bill; and
       A13.10.1.8. As of the date of the Airman's application to use Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits,
       meets the requirements for entitlement to educational assistance under the Post-9/11 GI
       Bill.
   A13.10.2. The method and process of making the election to use Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits
   will be determined by the DVA using VA Form 22-1990.
   A13.10.3. An election to convert from MGIB (Chapter 30) to the Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter
   33) is irrevocable and will be governed by the DVA. This includes Airmen who converted
   from VEAP to MGIB, as their decision to convert to MGIB is irrevocable.
   A13.10.4. An Airman entitled to educational assistance under the Post-9/11 GI Bill who is
   also eligible for educational assistance under the MGIB, Chapters 31, 32, or 35 of title 38,
   U.S.C., the EATP, MGIB-SR, REAP, or the provisions of the Hostage Relief Act of 1980
   (Public Law 96) may not receive assistance under two or more such programs concurrently,
   but shall elect (in such form and manner as the Secretary of Veterans Affairs may prescribe)
   under which chapter or provisions to receive educational assistance.
A13.11. Cessation of pay reduction under MGIB. Effective as of the first day of the month
beginning on or after the date of an election under paragraph A.9.10.4 above, an Airman having
pay reduced for MGIB enrollment, shall have that pay reduction ceased, and the requirements of
 90                                                           AFI36-2649 1 OCTOBER 2014


such section shall be deemed no longer applicable to the Airman. Airmen must take action to
have payments stopped once the Certificate of Eligibility is received.
A13.12. Refund of pay reduction under MGIB. An Airman who is described in paragraph
A.9.10., whose pay was reduced due to enrollment in MGIB, will receive a refund of that pay
reduction subject to the following:
   A13.12.1. A full refund for an Airman who used no months of benefit under the MGIB.
   A13.12.2. A refund reduced by a proportion calculated by the number of months of MGIB
   benefits used divided by 36.
   A13.12.3. To receive this refund, Airmen MUST exhaust their total entitlement under the
   Post-9/11 GI Bill. The refund will be added to the monthly housing allowance paid in the last
   month of eligibility under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Airmen who do not exhaust entitlement
   under the Post-9/11 GI Bill will not receive a refund of the pay reduction. Example: An
   Airman used 25 months of MGIB (Chapter 30), converts to Post-9/11 (Chapter 33), he/she
   has 11 months of remaining benefits under Post-9/11 (Chapter 33). If he/she does not
   exhaust these 11 months of benefits, no refund of the $1,200 will be given.
A13.13. Treatment of Certain Contributions Under MGIB and REAP (commonly called
Buy-Up).
   A13.13.1. Airmen who participated in the Buy-Up provision of MGIB or REAP will not
   receive the Buy-Up amount if they elect to use benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. There is
   no provision to allow for a refund of any Buy-Up contribution.
   A13.13.2. There is no provision to allow for increasing the amount allowed for Post-9/11 GI
   Bill through use of a Buy-Up.
A13.14. MGIB Benefits Exhaustion. Airmen who have exhausted their MGIB benefits can
qualify for an additional 12 months of benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill based on DVA policy.
A13.15. MGIB Conversion. For Airmen eligible for MGIB who make an election to convert to
the Post-9/11 GI Bill, the number of months of entitlement of the Airman to educational
assistance under the Post-9/11 GI Bill shall be the number of months equal to the number of
months of unused entitlement of the Airman under MGIB as of the date of the election. Airmen
are encouraged to assess their educational goals to determine the time they select Post-9/11 GI
Bill benefits. Example: An Airman who used 25 months of MGIB (Chapter 30), converts to
Post-9/11 GI Bill; he/she has 11 months of remaining benefits of Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits.
Alternatively, an Airman with 11 months of MGIB may choose to exhaust those benefits and
then apply for an extra 12 months of benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill.
A13.16. MGIB Conversion - Additional. In addition to the educational benefits previously
described, Airmen who were eligible for benefits under MGIB, MGIB-SR, or REAP, and elect to
use benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, will be eligible to receive benefits for on-the-job
training, apprenticeship training, correspondence courses, flight training, preparatory courses,
and national exams. Airmen in these circumstances will be paid just like they would have been
paid under their GI Bill program (i.e., money paid to them for tuition, not to the school); they
will not receive a living allowance but will receive a lump sum Books & Supplies stipend in an
amount equal to $83 for each month (prorated for partial months and benefit level). The DVA is
the sole determination authority in such cases.
AFI36-2649 1 OCTOBER 2014                                                                         91


A13.17. MGIB Kicker Carryover. If eligible for Kickers under MGIB-SR, the member will
remain eligible for the Kicker payment if they elect to use benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill.
Kickers will be paid monthly each term (e.g., semester, quarter, etc.) and will be prorated based
upon the monthly kicker value that existed at the time of election.
A13.18. Transferability of unused benefits to dependents.
   A13.18.1. Eligibility.
       A13.18.1.1. Any member of the Armed Forces (active duty and/or Selected Reserve) on
       or after August 1, 2009 who meets Post-9/11 GI Bill eligibility requirements and at the
       time of the approval of the member’s request to transfer entitlement to educational
       assistance the member meets one of the following:
           A13.18.1.1.1. Has at least 6 years of service in the Armed Forces (active duty and/or
           Selected Reserve, NOAA Corps, or PHS) on the date of application and agrees to
           serve 4 additional years in the Air Force from the date of request, regardless of the
           number of months transferred, or
           A13.18.1.1.2. Has at least 10 years of service in the Armed Forces (active duty
           and/or Selected Reserve, NOAA Corps, or PHS) on the date of application, is
           precluded by either Air Force policy (e.g., High Year Tenure (HYT)), DoD policy or
           statute from committing to 4 additional years of service and agrees to serve for the
           maximum amount of time allowed by such policy or statute.
   A13.18.2. Eligible Family Members.
       A13.18.2.1. A member approved to transfer unused Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits may
       transfer to:
           A13.18.2.1.1. the dependent spouse.
           A13.18.2.1.2. one or more of the member’s dependent children.
           A13.18.2.1.3. a combination of the above.
       A13.18.2.2. For eligibility under this section, the term child means a dependent
       registered in the Defense Eligibility Enrollment Reporting System (DEERS), who is
       unmarried and:
           A13.18.2.2.1. who is under twenty-three years of age
           A13.18.2.2.2. a child's marriage after transfer of benefits is approved may not affect
           his or her eligibility to receive the education benefits; however, after an individual has
           designated a child as a transferee under this section, the individual retains the right to
           revoke or modify the transfer at any time.
           A13.18.2.2.3. Status of a child in paragraph A.9.18.2.2. is based on the date of
           approval of the request to transfer benefits, not on the date of request to transfer
           benefits.
       A13.18.2.3. If an eligible individual elects to transfer his or her entitlement to a spouse,
       regarding a subsequent divorce, the member's TEB entitlement under this section is not
       marital property, or the asset of a marital estate, subject to division in a divorce or other
       civil proceeding and will not affect the transferee's eligibility to receive educational
92                                                             AFI36-2649 1 OCTOBER 2014


     benefits; however, the eligible individual retains the right to revoke or modify the transfer
     at any time. If a member transfers months and then revokes, the member making the
     transfer will be jointly and separately liable for the amount of the overpayment. The
     DVA is responsible for recouping overpayment of benefits.
     A13.18.2.4. A family member must be enrolled in DEERS at the time of transfer to
     receive transferred entitlement.
  A13.18.3. Months of Transfer. The number of months of benefits transferred by a member
  under this section may not exceed 36 months total. The amount of unused benefits remaining
  is determined by the DVA or the number of months specified by the Secretary of Defense. A
  member can make a transfer of whole months, no partial month. A member must transfer at
  least one month to have a fully executed transfer of benefits.
  A13.18.4. Transferee Usage. Dependent use of transferred educational benefits is subject to
  the following:
     A13.18.4.1. A spouse:
         A13.18.4.1.1. May start to use the benefit immediately after the member making the
         transfer has completed at least 6 years of service in the Armed Forces.
         A13.18.4.1.2. May use the benefit while the member remains in the Armed Forces,
         or after separation from active duty after completing the additional service required to
         transfer the educational assistance under the Post-9/11 GI Bill.
         A13.18.4.1.3. Is subject to the same 15-year limitation as the member.
     A13.18.4.2. A child:
         A13.18.4.2.1. May start to use the benefit after the member making the transfer has
         completed at least 10 years of service in the Armed Forces.
         A13.18.4.2.2. May use the benefit while the member remains in the Armed Forces.
         A13.18.4.2.3. May not use the benefit until they have met the requirements of a
         secondary school diploma or equivalency certificate, or reached 18 years of age.
         A13.18.4.2.4. Is not subject to the 15-year time limitation, but may not use the
         benefit after reaching 26 years of age.
         A13.18.4.2.5. An eligible member can transfer educational benefits to children ages
         21 and 22 if they are dependent students. The student status determination must be
         made at a military ID card issuing facility. A dependent student is a full-time student
         who is dependent on the member for more than 50% of his/her support. NOTE: if
         the 21 or 22 year-old child is attending school less than full time, or enrolled in on-
         the-job training, apprenticeships, or non-college degree programs, the child may still
         be qualified to receive transferred benefits even though TEB may display the child as
         ineligible. The timing of the dependent student status determination is important.
         Full-time student status cannot be determined more than 90 days prior to the child's
         21st birthday. If student status is not determined prior to the child's 21st birthday, all
         DoD benefits will be terminated in DEERs and member will not be able to transfer
         educational benefits in TEB.
AFI36-2649 1 OCTOBER 2014                                                                     93


         A13.18.4.2.6. Children on or over the age of 23 are no longer eligible to receive a
         transfer of benefits and are, therefore, displayed as ineligible in the TEB system.
         Children who are dependent students and are 23 years old or over are displayed as
         eligible and they may use the benefits until age 26 . NOTE: All transfers must be
         accomplished prior to the age of 23.
  A13.18.5. Nature of Transferred Entitlement. The entitlement transferred will be available
  as follows:
     A13.18.5.1. A spouse:
         A13.18.5.1.1. Is entitled to educational assistance under this chapter in the
         same manner as the member from whom the entitlement was transferred.
         A13.18.5.1.2. Is not eligible for the monthly housing allowance (if otherwise
         eligible) while the member is serving on active duty.
     A13.18.5.2. A child:
         A13.18.5.2.1. Is entitled to educational assistance under this chapter in the same
         manner as the member from whom the entitlement was transferred as if the member
         were not on active duty.
         A13.18.5.2.2. Is entitled to the monthly stipend (if otherwise eligible) and the books
         and supplies stipend regardless of status of the member.
  A13.18.6. Designation of Transferee. A member transferring an entitlement to educational
  assistance under this section shall:
     A13.18.6.1. Designate the dependent or dependents to whom such entitlement is being
     transferred;
     A13.18.6.2. Designate the number of months of such entitlement to be transferred to
     each dependent; and
     A13.18.6.3. Specify the period for which the transfer shall be effective for each
     dependent; the effective period must be on or after the date of designation.
  A13.18.7. Time for Transfer, Revocation, and Modification.
     A13.18.7.1. Time for Transfer. A member approved to transfer entitlement to
     educational assistance under this section may transfer such entitlement to dependents
     only while serving as a member of the Armed Forces (RegAF, AFR, or ANG) when the
     transfer is executed.
     A13.18.7.2. Modification or Revocation.
         A13.18.7.2.1. A member transferring entitlement under this section may modify or
         revoke at any time the transfer of any unused portion of the entitlement so transferred.
         A13.18.7.2.2. A member may add new dependents, modify entitlement for existing
         dependents, or revoke entitlement while serving in the Armed Forces.
         A13.18.7.2.3. A Veteran may modify entitlement or revoke entitlement among only
         those dependents to whom the Veteran transferred benefits prior to separating from
         the Armed Forces. Veterans who transferred entitlement prior to separating or
94                                                           AFI36-2649 1 OCTOBER 2014


         retiring from the Armed Forces may not add new dependents after separation or
         retirement.
         A13.18.7.2.4. The modification or revocation of the transfer of entitlement under this
         paragraph shall be made by submitting notice of the action to both the Air Force via
         the Transferability of Educational Benefits (TEB) website and the Secretary of
         Veterans Affairs as determined by the DVA. After separation or retirement,
         modifications or revocations must be done through the DVA.
         A13.18.7.2.5. Revocation of transferred benefits does not automatically cancel the
         member's Active Duty Service Commitment (ADSC).
  A13.18.8. Other Administrative Issues
     A13.18.8.1. The use of any entitlement to educational assistance transferred will be
     charged against the entitlement of the member making the transfer at the rate of one
     month for each month of transferred entitlement that is used.
     A13.18.8.2. The death of a member who transferred benefits will not affect the use of the
     entitlement by the dependent to which the entitlement was transferred.
     A13.18.8.3. A dependent to whom the entitlement is transferred may use the entitlement
     for the pursuit and completion of the requirements of a secondary school diploma (or
     equivalency certificate).
     A13.18.8.4. In the event of an overpayment of educational assistance with respect to a
     dependent to which entitlement is transferred, the dependent and the member making the
     transfer will be jointly and separately liable for the amount of the overpayment. The
     DVA is responsible for recouping overpayment of benefits.
     A13.18.8.5. Failure to Complete Service Agreement. Except as provided below, if a
     member transferring entitlement under this section fails to complete the service agreed to
     by the member under paragraph A.9.18.1. in accordance with the terms of the agreement
     of the member under that paragraph, the amount of any transferred entitlement that is
     used by a dependent of the member as of the date of such failure shall be treated as an
     overpayment of educational assistance and will be subject to collection by the DVA.
     Exceptions:
         A13.18.8.5.1. The death of the member.
         A13.18.8.5.2. Discharge or release from active duty or SelRes for a medical

         determined by the Secretary of the Air Force.
         A13.18.8.5.4. Discharge or release from active duty or SelRes for a physical or
         mental condition not a disability and that did not result from the member’s own
         willful misconduct, but did interfere with the performance of duty.

     A13.18.8.6. A member who separates or is released from Armed Forces prior to
     completion of an agreed upon additional service commitment will have their transfer of
     benefits revoked by the DVA. Benefits already used by a dependent will be recouped by

         A13.18.8.6.1. If the Airman was a member of the active component, the Airman may
         join a Selected Reserve unit (i.e., Palace Chase or Palace Front) and regain the
         authority to transfer benefits if the Airman agrees to serve at least the remaining
         length of time which was not served under the original agreement.
         A13.18.8.6.2. If the Airman was in a Selected Reserve unit, that Airman may join the
         active component and regain the authority to transfer benefits if the Airman agrees to

         agreement.
  A13.18.9. Transfer of Benefits Procedures. All requests and transactions will be completed
  through the TEB Web application at https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/MILCONNECT. Airmen

  Post-9/11 GI Bill eligibility from the DVA’s website prior to requesting to transfer of
  benefits.
     A13.18.9.1. Site security management.
         A13.18.9.1.1. The AF/A1PA is the active component TEB site security manager with
         execution responsibility maintained by AFPC.
         A13.18.9.1.2. The National Guard Bureau, Air National Guard (ANG) Recruiting
         and Retention Directorate, is the TEB site security manager for the ANG. This

         A13.18.9.2.4. All personnel identified as certifying officials will need to be identified
         to the AF/A1, Chief of the Air Force Reserve and Chief of the Air National Guard.
     A13.18.9.3. Once certifying officials have approved a request to transfer benefits,
     Airmen may print a hard copy of the certified TEB request for their personal records.
     Additional service commitments will be recorded in the appropriate personnel system(s).
 96                                                               AFI36-2649 1 OCTOBER 2014


       Additional service commitments resulting from transferring unused Post-9/11 GI Bill
       benefits begin on the date of request and are served concurrent with any other additional
       service commitment in effect at the time of the transfer or incurred at any time after the
       request to transfer benefits. Transfer of Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, in and of itself, will
       not limit any other reenlistment option or incentive to which a member may be eligible.
       A13.18.9.4. The DVA will verify that members are entitled to the total number of
       months of benefits that a member requests to transfer. In the event a member requested
       to transfer more months of Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits than to which entitled, the member
       may, within 30 days from date of notification from the DVA, revoke the transfer of
       unused benefits and rescind the additional service obligation unless already serving on a
       term of reenlistment. If the member elects to modify the number of months transferred to
       match the total number of months the DVA determined is available, the original
       additional service commitment will remain in effect.
A13.19. Supplemental Educational Assistance (Kickers). The Air Force has not implemented
any supplemental educational assistance for the Post-9/11 GI Bill for airmen, including RegAF,
AFR and ANG.
