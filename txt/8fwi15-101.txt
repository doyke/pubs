         15    Accomplish Administrative Tasks.

1.4. Limitations. WF support to the 8 FW is limited as follows:
     1.4.1. Interruption of the normal receipt of alphanumeric and graphic data via various
     interconnected weather data systems, Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network
     (NIPRNET) or Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) can severely degrade
     the forecasting capabilities.
     1.4.2. Due to the unpredictability of weather events, forecasts beyond 24 hours will be used
     for planning purposes only.
     1.4.3. Many flying areas are over unpopulated or water regions. Lack of weather data from
     such areas may limit the thorough weather watch capabilities of the weather technician. Pilot
     reports are extremely useful over data sparse areas.
     1.4.4. Buildings around the observation point obstruct some surface visibility markers
     toward the north and the southeast. There are no visibility markers between one and six SM
     over the water from the south through northwest direction.
     1.4.5. Ramp lighting near the augment observing location may cause glare, making it
     difficult for the forecaster to determine visibility at night.
     1.4.6. Annual rotation of personnel limits experience in this region.
     1.4.7. In the event of a primary operating location evacuation, WF personnel will begin
     continuity of operations procedures at the Alternate Operating Location (AOL). While at the
     AOL, WF personnel will not have access to the WSR-88D weather radar or to the PMSV. In
     the event 8 OSS/OSW personnel are no longer able to provide support to 8 FW agencies, 17
     OWS will assume all weather support responsibilities as documented in AFMAN 15-129 V2,
     Air and Space Weather Operations-Processes and Procedures, and in the current 8 OSS/17
     OWS Installation Data Page (IDP).
     1.4.8. The AOL does not have facsimile capability. WF personnel will not be able to
     provide flight weather briefings to aircrews from the AOL via facsimile.
8FWI15-101 17 APRIL 2012                                                                         7


1.5. Dissemination of Weather Information. Reliable communications are crucial to the
dissemination of weather information throughout Kunsan AB. It is incumbent on all weather
personnel to ensure dissemination through timely and proper notifications. Proper situational
awareness is paramount to the right people are warned of given weather conditions.
   1.5.1. Joint Environmental Toolkit. JET is the primary method used by the WF and 17
   OWS for dissemination of observations, weather warnings, watches and advisories, etc. The
   Air Traffic Control (ATC) Tower and Radar Approach Control (RAPCON) are equipped
   with Air Force Automated System (AFAS) monitors for viewing JET information, and the
   JET software can also be accessed on any computer connected to the base network. The JET
   portal will display current observations, forecasts, and watches, warnings, and advisories.
   Organizations with JET access must monitor the system and ensure mission-essential data is
   not disregarded.
       1.5.1.1. Under normal operations when JET is fully functional, dissemination of weather
       watches, warnings, and advisories (WWAs) by direct telephone notification will be
       limited to the following three agencies: 8 FW/CP, 8 OSS ATC Tower (8 OSS/OSAT),
       and 8 OSS Airfield Management Operations (8 OSS/OSAM) IAW AFI 10-229. 8
       OSS/OSAT will forward WWAs to the SOF.
       1.5.1.2. During JET outages, warnings, watches, and advisories will be disseminated by
       the WF via telephone ―hotline‖ to those agencies first to that directly control aircraft for
       flight safety reasons, IAW AFI 10-229. These agencies include the following three
       agencies: 8 OSS/OSAT, 8 OSS/OSAM and 8 FW/CP. 8 OSS/OSAT will be responsible
       for contacting the SOF. Long-line dissemination will be done using another base weather
       station computer, OWS, or via the Internet using the Joint Army-Air Force Weather
       Information Network (https://weather.afwa.af.mil).
   1.5.2. Internet/LAN: If requested, weather services/briefings can be sent via e-mail to
   requesting agencies.
   1.5.3. Weather Channel. The Base Weather Channel is currently on the Kunsan AB cable
   system, Channel 21. A current five-day forecast is routinely available. During a severe
   weather event, additional information concerning weather advisories and/or warnings may be
   posted, if available and time permitting, including start and end times, base impact, running
   totals and updates. Command and control instructions pertaining to a given weather event
   may be found on Channel 12, Commander’s Access Channel.
   1.5.4. Web-Based Weather Products. The WF has various weather products available on
   the Wolf Pack Share Point site. This website is continuously monitored for accuracy and is
   updated on a monthly basis at a minimum. WF SharePoint can be accessed at the following
   link:
   https://kunsan.eim.pacaf.af.mil/sites/Weather/Shared%20Documents/WEATHER.aspx
1.6. Release of Weather Information. The WF will not provide weather support or
information to non-DOD organizations or to the general public except as authorized by AFI,
7AF/CC or the 8 FW/CC (or designated representative). In addition, no Kunsan AB or 8 FW
agencies will release weather data to outside agencies unless first coordinated with the WF.
1.7. Change to 8 FWI 15-101. Requests for changes to this instruction will be coordinated
through the WF annually or as changes in weather support requirements dictate.
 8                                                               8FWI15-101 17 APRIL 2012


                                             Chapter 2

              WEATHER FLIGHT OPERATIONS – OBSERVING SERVICES

2.1. Duty Hours and Contacting Base Weather Station. The WF provides a certified weather
technician at the base weather station, Building 2858, as indicated in the DoD Flight Information
Publication. The ASE forecaster hours are 0600-1800L, Monday through Friday excluding
holidays and down days, and may be contracted/extended based on periods of limited/extended
flying, night qualifications, and/or automated sensor outages/augmentation. During OREs and
ORIs, the ASE will be manned continuously until ENDEX is announced, and Day shift is from
0600-1800L, while Swing shift is 1800-0600L. In addition, 8 FW staff weather services are
available Monday - Friday 0800-1700L, excluding holidays and down days. 8 OSS/OSW will
inform AMOPS to send a NOTAM with weather's adjusted operating hours during non-
published limited duty periods. During limited-duty hours, a qualified weather technician will
remain on call and can be recalled directly or via Command Post (8 FW/CP). Weather support
will be available at all times from the 17 OWS. Contact information for these agencies, to
include the standby weather technician cell phone, is listed in Attachment 1.
2.2. Primary Observation Equipment. The AN/FMQ-19 Automated Meteorological Station
(AMOS) will be the primary piece of equipment used to take and format weather observations at
Kunsan AB. It includes the following sensors:
     2.2.1. Wind Sensor (10 meter height).
     2.2.2. Ceilometer.
     2.2.3. Visibility Sensor.
     2.2.4. RVR Sensor.
     2.2.5. Temperature Sensor.
     2.2.6. Relative Humidity Sensor.
     2.2.7. Liquid Precipitation Measurement Sensor.
     2.2.8. Lightning Detection Sensor.
     2.2.9. Barometer (Station Pressure/Altimeter Setting).
     2.2.10. The AN/FMQ-19 interfaces directly with JET so that observations can be
     disseminated to local and long-line agencies automatically (See paragraph 2.10).
2.3. Official Observation Site. The official observation site is the location of the AN/FMQ-19
sensor suite. The primary sensor suite is located at the touchdown area of RWY 36 (See
Attachment 7). This sensor suite contains the instruments located in paragraph 2.2. The
discontinuity sensor suite, located adjacent to the touchdown area of RWY 18, contains only a
wind sensor, ceilometer, and visibility sensor (See Attachment 7). The AN/FMQ-19 will report
conditions from the discontinuity suite when RWY 18 is declared the active runway or if primary
sensors on RWY 36 have failed. All other elements will be measured from the primary sensor
suite.
2.4. Automation and Augmentation of AN/FMQ-19 Data. The AN/FMQ-19 and JET
systems are designed to measure, format and disseminate weather observations automatically,
8FWI15-101 17 APRIL 2012                                                                         9


without assistance from weather personnel. As a result, most observations will be sent without
input from weather personnel. Weather personnel will only modify the observation prior to
transmission during situations listed in paragraphs 2.4.1 and 2.4.2 during duty hours or as
necessary during SWAP activation. Augmentation is the process of having position-qualified
weather technicians use ORM to manually add or edit data to an observation generated by a
properly sited AMOS. The two augmentation processes used are supplementing and backup.
Supplementing is a method of manually adding meteorological information to an automated
observation that is beyond the capabilities of the AN/FMQ-19 to detect and/or report. Backup is
the method of manually providing meteorological data and/or dissemination to an AN/FMQ-19
observation when the primary automated method is not operational or unavailable due to sensor
and/or communication failure.
   2.4.1. Supplementation of Observations: Weather technicians will supplement the
   AN/FMQ-19 observation prior to transmission when the weather technician observes criteria
   affecting Kunsan AB that is beyond the AN/FMQ-19’s capability to detect. Weather
   technician will not supplement the AN/FMQ-19 during non-duty or airfield closure hours.
   Note: this does not relieve weather flights of their AFI 10-229 responsibilities for responding
   to severe weather events during non-duty hours. Weather flights will continue to have
   Severe Weather Action Procedures (SWAP) in place to respond to severe weather threats.
   Weather personnel are required to log on to an AMOS and be prepared to supplement
   whenever a watch or warning has been issued for tornadic activity. Per AFMAN 15-111,
   Section 3.3, these criteria are as follows:
       2.4.1.1. Tornado, Funnel Cloud, or Waterspout.
       2.4.1.2. Hail greater than or equal to 1/4‖.
       2.4.1.3. Volcanic Ash.
       2.4.1.4. Visibility <1/4 mile (Local Requirement).
       2.4.1.5. When the above criteria are observed, weather technicians will ensure the data is
       included in all appropriate observations prior to transmission. If additional operationally
       significant parameters need to be reported/augmented please coordinate this requirement
       with the Weather Flight Commander.
   2.4.2. Backup of Observations: Except for some automated remarks, backup refers to
   weather technicians providing the same reporting capability as those provided by the AMOS.
   Weather technicians will backup the AMOS equipment if the system/sensor(s) is/are not
   operational or unavailable due to sensor and/or communication failure. Weather technicians
   will make every attempt to immediately log out any broken equipment, except when
   immediate flight safety (i.e., in-flight emergency) warrants otherwise. Weather technicians
   are not required to log a system/sensor out if a deficiency report is currently published by
   AFWA, or backup is required due to a system re-start. There is no requirement to backup the
   system/sensor during non-duty hours or when the airfield is closed, unless tornadic activity is
   occurring or forecast to occur, then backup or supplement as necessary. Backup information
   is required for long line dissemination, for OWS terminal aerodrome forecast (TAF)
   production, and for local ground-to-air dissemination to sustain air operations at the airfield.
   Use manual observing procedures when performing backup operations. Technicians will
 10                                                              8FWI15-101 17 APRIL 2012


   ensure this backup data is input into the AN/FMQ-19 formatted observation prior to
   transmission (Described in paragraph 2.5.2).
2.5. Equipment Limitations and Backup Procedures. Current known equipment limitations
and backup procedures are listed below.
   2.5.1. AN/FMQ-19 Limitations.
       2.5.1.1. This system is only able to sample atmospheric information in the immediate
       vicinity and may not provide an accurate representation of weather in the entire
       aerodrome complex. Therefore, ceilings and visibility will only be measured and
       reported from or above the official observation site. Differing surrounding weather
       phenomenon will not be measured or reported.
       2.5.1.2. When visibility changes rapidly, the AN/FMQ-19 observation will lag the actual
       weather due to the time-averaged algorithms used by the system.
   2.5.2. FMQ-19 Backup: During FMQ-19 sensor failures, the following will occur:
       2.5.2.1. Tactical weather equipment (except ceiling and visibility) will be used to backup
       all FMQ-19 instruments.
       2.5.2.2. There is no backup to RVR measuring equipment. Therefore, RVRNO will be
       reported during applicable sensor failures.
       2.5.2.3. Visibility will be backed up by human observers at Bldg 2858 or the AOL, as
       applicable.
       2.5.2.4. When tactical systems are used to backup the AN/FMQ-19, altimeter setting and
       wind values will be reported as estimated.
       2.5.2.5. The weather flight has no backup equipment for ceiling. If the ceilometer is
       non-operational, weather technicians will perform manual sky condition observations and
       will leverage alternate information sources, including PIREPs.
   2.5.3. Precipitation Measurement: The AN/FMQ-19 is the primary instrument for
   measuring local liquid precipitation measurements. In the event of AN/FMQ-19 failure, a
   rain gauge will be used as backup. Collection site will be located on the W side of Building
   2858 (ROKAF rain gauge) at the primary duty location and near the entry control point for
   the ATC tower at the AOL. Both locations will site the rain gauge at ground level.
       2.5.3.1. Observing Location: All elements will be taken consistent with the ROKAF
       rain gauge location except for observing visibility, which may be done in the tower
       located at the south end of bldg 2858.
2.6. Determination of Automated Observations: All observations that have been
automatically generated and disseminated without weather technician involvement, will be
preceded by AUTO at the beginning of the observation. This is an automatic function of the JET
System. If the observation has been augmented or backed-up, then AUTO will be removed from
the observation and replaced with A02A in the remark section
2.7. Additional Weather Equipment: The following list of weather equipment is used for
observing and forecasting and/or during augmentation of primary equipment:
8FWI15-101 17 APRIL 2012                                                                       11


   2.7.1. Weather Surveillance Radar, 1988 Doppler (WSR-88D). The WSR-88D is more
   commonly known as a Next Generation Radar, or NEXRAD. The NEXRAD at Kunsan AB
   is maintained by 8 CS. The WF accesses the radar data using the Open Principal User
   Processor (OPUP). This enables the WF to access real-time radar data on location and
   movement of precipitation, along with radar-estimated winds, cloud heights, and atmospheric
   moisture properties.
   2.7.2. Kestrel 4500 Pocket Weather Tracker. The Kestrel 4500 is a hand-held,
   commercial off-the-shelf device capable of providing measurements of wind speed, direction,
   temperature, wind chill, humidity, heat index, dew point, wet-bulb temperature, barometric
   pressure, pressure altitude, and density altitude. It is used during evacuations to the AOL and
   as a backup to the AN/FMQ-19.
2.8. Equipment Outage. The WF will track all equipment outages locally and report
significant outages to HQ PACAF Directorate of Weather (PACAF/A3OW) IAW PACAFI 15-
103, Weather Communications and Sensing Equipment Outage Reporting. WF personnel will
immediately notify the 17 OWS of any suspected or reported automated observing system sensor
degradations and/or failure.
2.9. Types of Observations: The following are observations produced and disseminated by the
AN/FMQ-19. Note: All times disseminated in reports will reference the 24-hour UTC clock.
   2.9.1. Meteorological Aviation Report (METAR): The METAR is the scheduled hourly
   observation taken between 55 and 59 minutes past the hour and contains a complete report of
   type of report, station identifier, date and time of report, report modifier (as applicable),
   wind, visibility, runway visual range, present weather and obscurations, sky condition,
   temperature, dew point, altimeter setting, and key remarks.
   2.9.2. Airfield Special (SPECI) Observations. In addition to hourly weather observations,
   SPECI observations are disseminated when observed weather criteria pass through
   significant weather thresholds established by AFMAN 15-111 and the 8 FW during periods
   when a normal METAR observation is not scheduled to be disseminated. These observations
   consist of the type of report, station identifier, date and time of report, report modifier (as
   applicable), time of the event, wind direction and speed, visibility, present weather, sky
   condition, air temperature, dew point temperature, altimeter setting, and optional remarks.
   General criteria for special observations are listed in Attachment 2 and are consistent with
   mission-limiting parameters for local airfield operations/approaches.
2.10. Dissemination of Observations. The AN/FMQ-19 interfaces directly with JET as the
primary dissemination tool for observations. If JET is inoperative and/or if the LAN is down,
technicians will take the observation created by the AN/FMQ-19 and transmit it to agencies that
control local air traffic (ATC and RAPCON) via telephone, radio, or any other available form of
communication first, then continue with local dissemination. After local agencies have been
notified, AN/FMQ-19 observations will be transmitted longline through the Joint Army Air
Force Weather Information Network (JAAWIN) or via another weather unit (e.g., 17 OWS or 51
OSS/OSW).
2.11. Basic Weather Watch (BWW). The AN/FMQ-19 continuously monitors and
disseminates METAR and SPECI observations on a 24/7 basis. WF technicians will periodically
check weather conditions at intervals not to exceed one hour during normal duty hours to ensure
 12                                                               8FWI15-101 17 APRIL 2012


augmentation operations do not need to be performed. A BWW is only required during
augmentation or AN/FMQ-19 system failure/outage. A BWW is also performed when
supplemental criteria is forecast to occur within 2 hours. During a BWW, weather technicians
will recheck weather conditions, at intervals not to exceed 20 minutes since the last
observation/recheck, to determine the need for a SPECI observation, when any of the following
conditions are observed to be occurring or are forecast to occur within 1 hour:
   2.11.1. Ceiling forms below or decreases to less than 1,500 feet.
   2.11.2. Ceiling dissipates, or increases to equal or exceed 1,500 feet.
   2.11.3. Visibility decreases to less than 3 miles (4800 meters).
   2.11.4. Visibility increases to equal or exceed 3 miles (4800 meters).
   2.11.5. Precipitation (any form).
   2.11.6. Thunderstorms.
   2.11.7. Fog or Mist.
2.12. Continuous Weather Watch. Weather Technician will perform a Continuous Weather
Watch when tornadic activity is observed.
2.13. Cooperative Weather Watch with Air Traffic Control. To ensure accuracy in
automated observations, a Cooperative Weather Watch has been established between the WF and
ATC personnel, which is designed to aid weather technicians in augmenting/backing up
AN/FMQ-19 observations. While performing the Cooperative Weather Watch, ATC personnel
will immediately contact 8 OSS/OSW weather technicians:
   2.13.1. Upon receipt of any PIREP from an aircrew.
   2.13.2. When any of the following criteria is observed and not reported in the latest weather
   observation:
       2.13.2.1. Tornadic Activity.
       2.13.2.2. Hail (of any size).
       2.13.2.3. Volcanic Ash.
       2.13.2.4. Thunderstorms/Lightning.
       2.13.2.5. Rapidly decreasing Ceiling or Visibility.
       2.13.2.6. Precipitation.
       2.13.2.7. Tower prevailing and sector visibility when tower visibility is less than 4
       SM/6000 meters and different from the surface prevailing visibility.
       2.13.2.8. Any weather information from aircrews or ATC personnel (i.e., PIREP) that
       significantly differs from the latest observation.
       2.13.2.9. Any other significant weather phenomena not reported that is a threat to flight
       safety.
   2.13.3. Cooperative Weather Watch will be performed in accordance with local procedures.
   WF personnel will train air traffic controllers in Cooperative Weather Watch observation
8FWI15-101 17 APRIL 2012                                                                    13


   techniques. Specific responsibilities of Control Tower (8 OSS/OSAT) personnel are
   described in paragraph 6.4.3.
2.14. ―EYES FORWARD‖ Process/Procedure. The WF will serve an ―eyes forward‖ role for
17 OWS forecaster, allowing for the integration of weather data, meteorological satellite
imagery, lightning detection readouts, and non-standard weather data systems to create an
integrated weather picture and near-term forecast for the OWS. This process provides
meaningful meteorological information not contained in the coded observations to the 17 OWS
as an integral part of our METWATCH process (phone calls, emails, etc.). Additionally, 8
OSS/OSW weather technicians integrate the current state of the atmosphere into an
understanding of future impacts on forecast conditions and communicate these impacts to 17
OWS, enhancing the total support to local units. WF personnel will continuously stay engaged
with 17 OWS forecasters during duty hours to fulfill this ―eyes forward‖ function and ensure
complete weather support is given to Kunsan AB tenant units. In the case of unforeseen
circumstances, such as the need for enhanced mission watch, expanded eyes forward, or
communications failure/outages between the 17 OWS and the WF, the WF/CC or NCOIC will
initiate SWAP procedures when requested by the 17 OWS.
2.15. Recall Standby Personnel. If required during non-duty hours, weather personnel can be
recalled and ready for operations within 30 minutes of notification (duty and home phone
numbers are located on the recall rosters provided to 8 FW/CP). If severe weather is expected,
SWAP will be activated with as much lead time as possible to analyze threats or expected severe
weather impacts. The team will coordinate and provide situational awareness to local leadership
and keep them informed of all pertinent weather changes. SWAP is further defined in chapter
4.5.
 14                                                                8FWI15-101 17 APRIL 2012


                                            Chapter 3

           WEATHER FLIGHT OPERATIONS – FORECASTING SERVICES

3.1. Duty Hours: 8 OSS/OSW will provide forecast services to all 8 FW aircraft departing
Kunsan AB. Aircrew will normally be briefed at their respective squadrons by dedicated
briefers. Staff weather support to the 8 FW is available during routine office hours (Paragraph
2.1.) or as required during exercises and contingencies. For transient aircrews operating from
Kunsan AB, flight weather briefing support will be provided or arranged during duty hours as
duty priorities permit. If duty priorities do not allow the WF to provide transient aircrew briefs
in a timely manner (30 minutes), aircrews will be referred to the 17 OWS for support. 17 OWS
briefers can be reached at DSN 449-7935. Aircraft departing on weekends, holidays or outside 8
FW flying hours must also contact the 17 OWS for weather support. Flight weather briefings
from the OWS can also be requested and retrieved via their web page,
https://17ows.hickam.af.mil/wx_brief/index.cfm?fuseaction=request&UID=&BW=H&UF=
O&AOR=2&sc=043526. Transient aircrews should request routine flight weather briefings a
minimum of two hours prior to desired brief time to give the 17 OWS adequate time to prepare.
The 17 OWS will complete no-notice and short-notice briefings when able based on their current
workload, available manpower, and duty priorities. The OWS will prioritize no-notice flight
weather briefing requests below existing requests unless special circumstances warrant a higher
priority (e.g., alert, search and rescue, medical evacuation). Transient aircrews may request
OWS support via dedicated computer equipment located in the Base Operations flight planning
room (adjacent to the WF). The flight planning room has a computer with Internet access and
weather support bookmarks, printer, telephone with a weather support phone list and mission
planning supplies. If immediate/specialized weather services are needed during non-duty hours,
8 OSS/OSW forecasting personnel can be recalled at any time by contacting the 8 OSS/OSW
standby weather technician at 010-8500-7389 and/or via 8 OSS/OSAM at DSN: 782-4422.
3.2. Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFs). The TAF is a specialized, 30-hour aerodrome
forecast specifying key weather elements and conditions for the airfield complex. The airfield
complex is defined as the area within 5 nautical miles (8000 meters) of the center of Kunsan AB
(RKJK) runway. The TAF is issued at 0700Z, 1500Z and 2300Z by the 17 OWS and will be
amended IAW AFMAN 15-129 V1 and local amend criteria. Each TAF specifies the time of
occurrence to the nearest hour, duration and intensity (if applicable) of weather conditions
expected to occur. The OWS forecaster will amend the TAF when an unforecast change occurs
and is expected to last at least 30 minutes, or if forecast conditions do not occur by the specified
hour and are not expected to occur within the next 30 minutes. The type and level of 17 OWS
TAF support will follow specifications listed in AFMAN 15-129 V1, which is reviewed at least
annually for amendments. TAFs will be coordinated with the WF prior to dissemination when a
Kunsan AB weather technician is on duty. TAF specification/amendment criteria are listed in
Attachment 4.
3.3. Mission Execution Forecast (MEF). The WF will produce a tailored MEF to the specific
weather parameters, thresholds, and sensitivities of the 8 FW and its mission(s) and include a
forecast for Kunsan AB. The MEF will be disseminated via mass weather briefings provided to
the 35 FS and the 80 FS, which are normally three hours before takeoff. Step briefings are given
70 minutes prior to takeoff.          The MEF is also posted to the WF webpage
8FWI15-101 17 APRIL 2012                                                                       15

f MEF procedures are listed in Attachment 10 and the MEF Process is specified in local
procedures.
   3.3.1. Supported unit MEF requirements. The format, timing and dissemination of the
   MWP from the MEFP will be driven by supported unit(s) requirements. 8 OSS/OSW will
   coordinate with the supported unit(s) to determine the content and format to ensure it
   contains decision-grade information applicable to the mission. The squadron’s Directors of
   Operations (DO) approve/determine the format, timing, dissemination and content of the
   MWP to ensure it contains decision-grade information applicable to the mission. Examples
   of content that has been added to the MEF include: IR visibility, transmissivity, enhanced
   information involving illumination data valid times etc.
   3.3.2. Support to Deployed/Expeditionary Units. Weather support for any unit
   deployed/expeditionary to Kunsan AB will be coordinated with their respective unit’s
   weather team and 8 OSS/OSW. Coordination will detail to the fullest extent possible how to
   arrange for or provide weather support; and by what means the weather support will be
   provided. For large force employment missions, with force packages from different
   locations, the weather unit supporting the Command and Control element will act as lead for
   planning purposes.
   3.3.3. Theater Support Package (TSP) Support. TSP will be provided 8FW MEF NLT
   three hours prior to first launch.
3.4. Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV). The PMSV is available during WF duty hours on 346.5
MHz, with a standard operating range of 30 nautical miles. For outages lasting less than an hour,
8 OSS/OSAT will monitor the PMSV frequency and relay all requests for weather information to
WF personnel. Long-term backup procedures to PMSV operations will be provided by the 51
OSS/OSW, Osan AB. Any US aircraft within radio range of Kunsan AB may contact the WF on
the above frequency to request weather information.
3.5. Pilot Reports (PIREPs).
   3.5.1. PIREPs are reports of in-flight weather made by aircrews. PIREPs will be relayed to
   the WF via PMSV, phone-patch, ATC agencies, or the SOF. ATC or Base Operations are
   required to pass PIREPs to WF forecasters within 5 minutes of receipt. Any 8 FW aircrew
   encountering hazardous weather conditions which jeopardize flight safety report conditions
   to the WF IAW AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules, paragraph 5.22.1. Also useful are
   flight level winds, bases/tops of clouds (approach ceilings), visibility (approach visibility),
   turbulence, icing, thunderstorms, hail, or low level wind shear, and runway braking action.
   3.5.2. Aircrews providing a PIREP must state location (including flight level) and time the
   significant weather was observed for a PIREP to be disseminated, IAW AFMAN 15-124.
   3.5.3. Any PIREPs significant to local flying will be disseminated locally using JET.
   Significant local PIREPs will include any weather criteria at or below the TAF specification
   criteria listed in Attachment 4 with the exception of temperature. All other PIREPs deemed
   as not significant will be relayed to the OWS. At a minimum, all urgent (UUA) PIREPs will
   be disseminated long-line and locally via approved local dissemination system. Urgent
   PIREPS are those which include any of the following elements:
 16                                                             8FWI15-101 17 APRIL 2012


       3.5.3.1. Tornado, water spout, or funnel cloud.
       3.5.3.2. Thunderstorms. Only report as severe if thunderstorms are in an area of
       widespread activity, along a line with little or no space between individual storms, or
       embedded in cloud layers or concealed in haze. Isolated or scattered thunderstorms not
       embedded in clouds or concealed in haze are not reported as severe.
       3.5.3.3. Tropical Cyclones.
       3.5.3.4. Squall Lines.
       3.5.3.5. Severe Icing.
       3.5.3.6. Severe or extreme turbulence, including Clear Air Turbulence (CAT).
       3.5.3.7. Mountain wave turbulence.
       3.5.3.8. Widespread dust storm or sand storm.
       3.5.3.9. Low-Level Wind Shear (LLWS). When the fluctuation in airspeed is 10 knots
       or more.
       3.5.3.10. Hail (GR or GS).
       3.5.3.11. Volcanic eruption and/or ash (VA) when reported by any source, in the air
       or the ground.
       3.5.3.12. Any condition that, in the judgment of the person entering the PIREP into the
       system, would present an extreme hazard to flight.
   3.5.4. If JET is not available, the WF will contact Osan AB Weather at DSN 784-9370, or
   the 17 OWS at DSN 449-4127 and ask the duty forecaster to assist in disseminating the
   PIREP.
3.6. Mission Watch (MISSIONWATCH). The weather technician will conduct a
MISSIONWATCH for 8 FW flying missions IAW local procedures. Mission meteorological
watch is a deliberate process for monitoring terrestrial weather or the space environment for
specific mission-limiting environmental factors. The MISSIONWATCH process identifies and
alerts decision makers to changes affecting daily missions. If observed weather criteria passes
critical mission thresholds outlined in Attachment 9, then WF personnel will amend the
MEF/step briefings and notify each supported units’ Top 3 via the following mediums/agencies:
   3.6.1. Mission Weather Element Technician.
       3.6.1.1. 35 FS: 782-4646.
       3.6.1.2. 80 FS: 782-5100.
       3.6.1.3. TSP: 782-3262/6492.
   3.6.2. SOF: 782-5503.
   3.6.3. Air Traffic Control: 782-2078.
   3.6.4. Airfield Operations: 782-4422.
   3.6.5. ORM will be applied to all MISSIONWATCH activities.
3.7. Deviations from Centralized Products.
8FWI15-101 17 APRIL 2012                                                                      17


   3.7.1. In the interest of flight safety or mission requirements, WF technicians may deviate
   from forecast products produced by the 17OWS as long as the criteria does not pass through
   thresholds listed in Attachment 4. If the MEF deviation passes through these TAF criteria
   thresholds, the WF will coordinate required amendments to the existing TAF, warnings,
   watches, and advisories with the OWS.
   3.7.2. Deviations will be documented and coordinated with the OWS to ensure any required
   amendments and/or weather warnings are issued, and the best possible product reaches all
   units.
   3.7.3. The WF will produce a MEF utilizing the current observation when the current TAF is
   not representative. Additionally, the WF will issue a forecast weather warning or advisory if
   either or both of the following situations occur:
       3.7.3.1. In the interest of flight safety or resource protection, a timely response to a
       warning and/or advisory cannot be met by the OWS. As soon as practical after issuance,
       the WF forecaster will notify 17 OWS to hand-off resource protection.
       3.7.3.2. If the OWS experiences equipment problems and calls the WF to issue the
       warning or advisory.
3.8. Space Weather Support. The WF will notify supported agencies of space weather impacts
and of the global and regional scale products available so they may assess potential space
weather impacts on aircraft and operations. Examples and explanations for space environment,
communication, alert and warning products are available at the following link:
https://kunsan.eim.pacaf.af.mil/sites/Weather/Shared%20Documents/WPWX/Library/Spa
ceWx/space.htm
   3.8.1. The WF will utilize the current suite of global and regional scale products provided by
   AFWA and the 17 OWS, which allow units to assess possible space weather impacts to
   aircraft and operations. These products can be found at the following addresses:
   https://weather.afwa.af.mil/space.html.,
   https://weather.afwa.af.mil/spaceHome/Products/SPACESUPPORT.GIF,                           and
   https://weather.afwa.af.mil/jefs_links/SW_U_GPS_PAC_F_FLAT_2D_000.GIF
   3.8.2. The WF will coordinate with 8 FW agencies concerning space weather thresholds and
   requirements to determine which products provide the most value in supporting 8 FW
   operations.
   3.8.3. As required, the WF will submit support assistance requests to AFWA’s Requirement
   Branch when the current suite of products do not meet WF unit requirements.
3.9. Bio-Environmental Information: 8 OSS/OSW will provide Chemical Downwind
Messages (CDMs), Effective Downwind Messages (EDMs) and Basic Wind Messages (BWMs)
to 8 CES/CEX and other pertinent weather information to Bio-environmental/Readiness agencies
as needed.
3.10. Electro-Optical Support. General electro-optical forecasts will be annotated on the MEF
if required for the mission. Target Acquisition Weapons Software (TAWS) is used to provide
electro-optical support as part of the military decision-making process (MDMP) and Intelligence
Preparation of the Operational Environment (IPOE). This information is delivered in the form of
at Tactical Decision Aid (TDA). TAWS is an Air Force and Army developed, certified, and
 18                                                               8FWI15-101 17 APRIL 2012


approved TDA that generates physics-based weather impacts in an easy to understand format.
Units and other decision-makers can request mission specific TDAs for both friendly and threat
platforms. For the weather input, TAWS may use real-time or model weather data downloaded
directly from AFWA or a Navy reach-back data server. 8 OSS/OSW weather technicians will
provide a TDA product using preset data for each range the aircrew will be utilizing, providing
the aircrew with: absolute humidity, Transmissivity, IR visibility, and thermal crossover. For
any other data or special support, weather technicians require at least two hours notification and
a detailed list of mission parameters, to create the TDA product.
   3.10.1. Required Information for TAWS Support. The following information must be
   provided to 8 OSS/OSW to generate TAWS products. This can be accomplished by
   contacting each of the on-site weather technicians at each flying squadron or any 8
   OSS/OSW weather technician at the weather flight (782-4501/4262): Note: Associating
   TAWS sensor ID numbers with a real-world sensor/weapon systems makes the information
   classified SECRET and must be protected accordingly.
       3.10.1.1. Aircrew name/squadron.
       3.10.1.2. Voice phone number/fax number/e-mail address.
       3.10.1.3. Type of target.

8FWI15-101 17 APRIL 2012                                                                      19


                                          Chapter 4

        WEATHER FLIGHT OPERATIONS – SEVERE WEATHER SERVICES

4.1. Weather Watches, Warnings, and Advisories (WWAs). 8 OSS/OSW performs a
Meteorological Watch (METWATCH) to detect the approach or development of weather
phenomena of operational interest, including severe weather. Notification of the approach or
development of weather phenomena that are expected to adversely impact operations or pose
hazards to life or property within five NM of the airfield is required by most units located at
Kunsan AB. This notice is provided by the issuance of weather advisories, watches, and
warnings. All WWA criteria and agencies responsible for issuing the WWA can be found in
Attachment 6.
4.2. Primary Dissemination. The 17 OWS will begin the dissemination process for forecast
WWAs by coordinating with the on duty weather technician. Afterwards, the 17 OWS will
transmit the applicable product over JET. This data will be displayed on the JET Flight
Operations terminals located in the control tower and RAPCON. In addition, the watch/warning
will be transmitted via telephone using an automated notification system called the Integrated
Weather Warning Capability (IWWC). For observed warnings and advisories, the WF will be
the issuing agency during duty hours, and will also use JET for dissemination. After the
WW/WA has been disseminated on JET, 8 OSS/OSW weather technicians will make telephone
verification of notification with ATC, CP, AMOPS, squadron briefers, and the EOC weather
person (during exercises and/or contingencies).
4.3. Numbering Procedures: All Kunsan AB Weather Watches, Warnings and Advisories will
be numbered using the following format: XX-yyy, where XX stands for the month the warning
was issued and yyy represents a cumulative total of each watch, warnings, or advisories issued
for that month. EXAMPLE: Warning number 02-004 would be the 4th warning issued during
the month of February. Watches, Warnings and Advisories are counted separately. Therefore, it
is possible to have a Watch, Warning and Advisory issued simultaneously that have the same
number.
4.4. Additional WWA Information: Weather warnings, watches, and advisories are further
disseminated by the 8 FW/CP IAW the notification matrix in Attachment 6 and by 8
OSS/OSAM as specified in paragraph 6.4.1.
   4.4.1. The WF will issue WWAs whenever the 17 OWS is unable to support this
   requirement due to equipment problems or relocation. Additionally, the WF will issue
   WWAs for imminent weather conditions that pose a hazard to life or property when time is
   critical. In these rare cases, the OWS will be back-briefed regarding the event as soon as
   possible and IAW duty priorities after the WF notifies local agencies. This will ensure the
   OWS enters the WWA into the automatic warning dissemination/tracking system and
   assumes METWATCH for the WW.
   4.4.2. Only one WW will be in effect at any one time. A warning may contain more than
   one warning criterion with different valid times for each of the criterion. The only exception
   to this is lightning, which may be issued as a separate warning.
4.5. Severe Weather Action Procedures (SWAP). Severe weather is defined as any weather
condition that poses a hazard to property or life (ref para 4.5.2.).
20                                                               8FWI15-101 17 APRIL 2012


  4.5.1. The Severe Weather Action Team (SWAT) has been established to assist the
  forecaster when severe weather conditions threaten the base. The SWAT consists of:
  Weather Flight Commander, Wing Weather Officer, NCOIC and Assistant NCOIC. A
  SWAT member will always be available and on-call to assist the forecaster with any severe
  weather forecasts and occurrences.
  4.5.2. At a minimum, the SWAT will be activated whenever watches or warnings are issued
  for the following conditions:
     4.5.2.1. Tornadic activity.
     4.5.2.2. Severe Thunderstorms (Winds > 50kts and/or Hail > 3/4").
     4.5.2.3. Damaging Winds > 50kts.
     4.5.2.4. Moderate Thunderstorms (Winds > 35, but < 50kts and/or Hail < 3/4")
     4.5.2.5. Freezing precipitation.
     4.5.2.6. Kunsan AB is placed in any TCCOR level.
  4.5.3. During Duty Hours: If any of the watches or warnings listed in paragraph 4.5.2 are
  issued, the WF technician will notify the standby Kunsan AB SWAT member through
  telephone recall and discuss whether or not the SWAT member is required.
  4.5.4. The WF/CC will initiate SWAT procedures when requested by the 17 OWS
  (enhanced mission watch, expanded ―EYES FORWARD‖, or communications outages
  between the 17 OWS and the WF
  4.5.5. If SWAT is required, the standby SWAT member will report to the weather station as
  soon as possible, but no later than 30 minutes after notification, and be briefed by the duty
  forecaster. He/she will then decide whether the situation warrants the full activation of the
  SWAT.
  4.5.6. All personnel will work as a team to increase radar, satellite, and lightning detection
  situational awareness, and observation meteorological watch at the WF. 8 OSS/OSW
  personnel will augment observations as required to maintain expanded ―eyes-forward‖
  situational awareness for the 17 OWS (See paragraph 2.4.1.).
  4.5.7. Weather support during periods of severe weather will be limited to mission-essential
  support only, to ensure critical weather information is relayed in a timely manner to those
  controlling flying or providing base resource protection.
  4.5.8. . All severe weather watches and warnings will be disseminated to base agencies
  through JET and confirmed via telephone notification, according to paragraph 4.2 of this
  instruction.
  4.5.9. SWAT members will act as the severe weather liaison to 8 FW leadership. Depending
  on the situation, additional notification, to include telephone calls, electronic mail messages,
  and in-person briefings may need to occur. The senior SWAT member on duty is responsible
  to coordinate these activities with 8 OSS/CC, 8 OSS/DO, 8 OG/CC, 8 OG/CD, 8 FW/CC,
  and 8 FW/CV, as applicable.
  4.5.10. Non-Duty Hours Weather Recall Action Procedures: During non-duty hours, 17
  OWS will contact the standby weather technician and/or the 8 OSS/OSW Flight Commander
8FWI15-101 17 APRIL 2012                                                                         21


   to relay all warnings issued. The standby weather technician and/or the 8 OSS/OSW Flight
   Commander will then discuss the weather situation with 17 OWS forecasters and determine
   whether or not to activate the SWAT and recall personnel if/when required. Once SWAT is
   activated, appropriate personnel will be recalled, and 8 OSS/OSW personnel will augment all
   observations as required to maintain expanded ―eyes-forward‖ situational awareness for the
   17 OWS. In addition, they will provide enhanced METWATCH and follow SWAP guidance
   outlined above in accordance with local procedures if/when required.
   4.5.11. SWAP will be exercised at least annually and documented to include lessons learned.
   A real-world severe weather event may serve as the annual exercise, provided it is
   documented appropriately.
4.6. Tropical Cyclone Action Procedures:
   4.6.1. Tropical Cyclone Procedures (Ref USFK Reg 115-1). The WF will monitor all
   tropical storms or typhoons west of 165°E and north of 10°N, which may be forecast to affect
   the Republic of Korea and/or be within 300 miles of the peninsula within 72 hours and will
   keep the 8 FW/CC and designated key personnel informed of the current situation and
   forecast track of the storm. The WF will ensure updated Tropical Cyclone Condition of
   Readiness (TCCOR) slides are shown on the Kunsan Weather Channel, and work to ensure
   continuous dial-in capability to the Kunsan NEXRAD is operational for geographically
   separated weather units.
       4.6.1.1. The JTWC at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii issues the official tropical cyclone track and
       intensity forecast for the Pacific and Indian Ocean basins. The JTWC forecast is the
       official forecast for all tropical systems that could impact Department of Defense assets.
       Warnings and bulletins are normally issued every six hours. These products typically
       include position and intensity forecasts for the next 120 hours, unless dissipation or extra
       tropical transition is predicted to occur earlier. Tropical cyclone forecasts past 48 hours
       contain a high degree of uncertainty, are for planning purposes only, and are subject to
       change.
       4.6.1.2. The 607th Weather Squadron Commander (607 WS/CC) at Yongsan AB is the
       principal advisor to the Commander, US Forces Korea (USFK/CC) for all tropical
       weather. The USFK/CC has delegated USFK/J3 Director of Operations TCCOR issuing
       authority for the Republic of Korea, when winds greater than 50 knots (including gusts)
       are forecast to occur anytime during the next 72 hours in a specific region. TCCORs are
       based on the latest JTWC tropical cyclone bulletin, input from the 607 WS and input
       from OWS forecasters. See Attachment 12 for TCCOR levels and sectors. Kunsan AB
       is in TCCOR sector 4.
4.6.1.3. Tropical Cyclone Threat Assessment Product (TC-TAP). When a tropical storm is
forecast to impact airfields in Korea, the 17 OWS will issue a Tropical Cyclone Threat
Assessment Product (TC-TAP). The TC-TAP bulletin identifies wind impacts on an airfield or
locality by tailoring forecast for local terrain effects to help mission planners and base agencies
make mission execution decisions such as evacuation and force protection. The 17 OWS will
create this product when winds greater than or equal to 35 knots are expected during the next 96
hours at any of their TAF locations in the ROK. This bulletin should be issued NLT 90 minutes
after the JTWC update, and will be posted on the 17 OWS webpage. The TC-TAP forecast for
Kunsan specifically addresses the maximum wind expected/date/time (sustained and gusts),
 22                                                               8FWI15-101 17 APRIL 2012


closest point of approach, beginning and ending of 25 knot sustained winds, 35 knot sustained
winds, 50 knot sustained winds, 80 knot sustained winds, and 20 knot crosswinds. Any time the
17 OWS issues the new TC-TAP (or JTWC issues a bulletin and the 17 OWS does not issue a
TC-TAP), the WF will update supported units and designated key 8 FW personnel with the latest
information via phone, e-mail, or fax. To access the 17 OWS TCTAP, reference the link below.
After clicking on the link, select the appropriately named storm (i.e. Claude). An example TC-
TAP is included in Attachment 12
https://17ows.hickam.af.mil/index.cfm?fuseaction=tc&AOI=6&UID=&BW=H&UF=M&AOR=1&USE
HF=1
       .
       4.6.1.4. Tropical Cyclone Message. When a tropical cyclone of tropical storm strength
       or greater passes within 150 miles of a USAF military weather reporting unit in PACOM,
       that unit will prepare a message IAW PACAFI 15-101, Weather Support for PACAF,
       paragraph 12 and send it to the JTWC within 24 hours of passage.
4.7. OPREP 3 Reporting
   4.7.1. Definition: OPREP-3 (Operational Report-3) reports use command post channels to
   immediately notify commanders of any significant event or incident that rises to the level of
   MAJCOM, HQ USAF, or DOD interests. 8 FW/CP will submit the applicable OPREP-3
   regardless of whether or not the event is being reported through other channels. OPREP-3
   reports do not replace the requirement for more detailed reports. A reportable incident is an
   incident, event, or accident which generates a higher level of military action, causes a
   national reaction, affects international relationships, causes immediate widespread coverage
   in news media, is clearly against the national interest, or affects current national policy.
   Significant weather occurrences are those in which significant weather occurs, resulting in
   damage.
       4.7.1.1. OPREP-3, Pinnacle/Beeline incidents/events.        OPREP-3 Pinnacle/Beeline
       reports use command and control channels to notify commanders immediately of any
       event or incident that may attract international, national, USAF, or significant news
       media interest. While WF personnel will primarily be responsible for OPREP-3
       reporting due to damage/injury from weather events, they may also be required to submit
       reports based on non-weather events. AFI 10-206, Chapter 3, lists various criteria and/or
       situations that would require these different reports.
       4.7.1.2. OPREP-3B, Beeline, Severe Weather Events. A Beeline provides information
       quickly through the chain of command to AF-level and may be of interest to specified
       offices outside the MAJCOM. A Beeline report is required for all severe weather events
       when damage occurs. The WF and OWS will provide information IAW AFI 10-206 for
       the OPREP-3 message to the 8 FW/CP whenever the following significant weather
       occurs and results in damage or impedes operations.
           4.7.1.2.1. Tornadic Activity.
           4.7.1.2.2. High Winds (> 50 knots to include gusts).
           4.7.1.2.3. Hail > 3/4 inch in diameter.
           4.7.1.2.4. Lightning Strikes (only when resulting in injury/damage).
8FWI15-101 17 APRIL 2012                                                                     23


          4.7.1.2.5. Heavy Snowfall.
          4.7.1.2.6. Aircraft evacuation due to typhoon/flood/natural disaster.
          4.7.1.2.7. Unit Commander-directed change to TCCOR (i.e. deviation from
          JTWC/17 OWS guidance).
          4.7.1.2.8. Any airborne instances of lightning strikes, electro-statis discharge, hail
          damage or other weather related events resulting in Class A, B, and C aircraft
          damage, aircrew injury or flight control problems.
      4.7.1.3. The WF and OWS will collaborate to provide the required weather data for the
      OPREP-3 message to the 8 FW/CP which includes: Name and location of unit
      submitting report, type of occurrence (BEELINE, HOMELINE, etc.), date/time/location
      of incident, actual severe weather conditions experienced and known resulting damage,
      forecast valid at the time of the occurrence to include any watches or warnings issued,
      and operational status of meteorological and communication equipment (e.g., radar, wind
      sensors, etc.) at the time of the event.
      4.7.1.4. The WF and 17 OWS will conduct a verbal review of the actions taken by both
      the WF and OWS. This review will be held via telephone after the event with the senior
      WF technician on scene and the applicable OWS regional supervisor if weather and duty
      priorities permit.
      4.7.1.5. All weather information transmitted to 8 FW/CP for a severe weather OPREP-3
      will also be sent to PACAF/A30A, 7 AF/A3W KAOC Wx, and the 17 OWS/CC via e-
      mail.
      4.7.1.6. ORM will be applied to all SWAT and Force Protection operations.
4.8. Backup Operations and the Alternate Operating Location (AOL).
   4.8.1. Weather Station Evacuation. Should the weather station become unusable, the
   ranking individual on duty will assume command of the relocation of weather personnel, will
   ensure that classified information/materials are secured, evacuated, or destroyed IAW AFI
   31-401, Information Security Program Management, and ensure all on-duty WF personnel
   evacuate to the AOL in Building 2829 (2nd floor of the ATC Tower). If necessary, squadron
   briefer(s) will evacuate to the 80 FS and/or 35 FS buildings. The Flight Commander and/or
   Wing Weather Officer may relocate to the Installation Control Center at Building 1305, as
   the situation warrants. WF/CC will ensure 100% accountability of WF personnel after
   station evacuation, to include off-duty WF personnel. All personnel evacuating the weather
   station will ensure that all required backup weather equipment is taken with evacuating
   personnel. The lead weather technician will inform the 17 OWS and base agencies listed in
   local procedures that the AOL is now in use, take and disseminate a weather observation
   within 15 minutes of arrival at AOL (if FMQ 19/JET are inop), and then begin ―EYES
   FORWARD‖ ops. WF personnel will continue to perform the MEFP, MISSIONWATCH,
   resource protection, SWAP and all other garrison support requirements from the AOL, with
   exception to established limitations (para 1.4), as established in Chapters 3 and 4. If the
   station is evacuated during an emergency, ORM will determine if WF personnel have time to
   secure classified and bring evacuation equipment with them.
 24                                                          8FWI15-101 17 APRIL 2012


   4.8.2. Backup Dissemination of Weather Products. While operating from the AOL, WF
   personnel will disseminate observations and observed weather advisories via JET and
   telephone as described in paragraph 2.10. If both JET and telephone service are lost, WF
   personnel must coordinate for Land Mobile Radio (LMR) support with 8 CS to ensure
   communications with 8 FW agencies are not lost. Until the WF is able to secure an LMR
   from the 8 CS, they will coordinate with Tower personnel to borrow an LMR to ensure
   dissemination of information from the AOL. On-duty weather personnel will continue to
   coordinate weather support for 8 FW agencies as long as communications with 8 FW
   agencies can be maintained.
   4.8.3. Weather Support Responsibilities in Backup Operations. The WF will continue to
   provide tailored weather support to 8 FW agencies as outlined in this plan, AFMAN 15-111
   and AFMAN 15-129. The OWS will continue to provide weather support to the WF as
   outlined in this plan and according to the most current IDP between 17 OWS and 8 OSS. In
   the event WF personnel are no longer able to provide support to 8 FW agencies, the OWS
   will assume all weather support responsibilities as documented in AFMAN 15-129, Table
   1.1, Chapters 3 and 4 of this document, and in the most current IDP between 17 OWS and 8
   OSS. The WF will assume responsibility for providing all weather support (TAF, WW/WA,
   flight weather briefings) for Kunsan AB in the event that 17 OWS operations are impaired
   due to lost communications, system failure, evacuation or any termination of service at
   Hickam AFB, IAW current 17 OWS - 8 OSS/OSW IDP.
   4.8.4. AOL Equipment and Capabilities. The AOL has network and JET connectivity,
   which provides the bulk of the weather data necessary for operations support. To help
   expedite the seamless transfer of weather information to 8 FW agencies, the AOL is also
   equipped to receive calls from the same telephone numbers as the base weather station. If
   primary weather data networks fail, weather personnel will utilize secondary and tertiary
   methods to measure, format and disseminate weather data to ensure operations support
   continues. The Kestrel 4500 NV is the primary backup piece of weather equipment to the
   FMQ-19. Wind and pressure values obtained from backup equipment will be reported as
   estimated.
   4.8.5. AOL Limitations. WSR-88D weather radar data is not available. There is no PMSV
   radio to monitor/respond to PMSV calls (see paragraph 3.4 for PMSV backup). Under
   normal circumstances, observations may still be taken/disseminated IAW paragraph 2.10.
   4.8.6. The official AOL observing site is the ―O‖ in ―FOD‖ at the FOD check point.
   However, the 3rd floor catwalk may be used to augment visibility observations.
   4.8.7. ORM will be applied to all emergency, evacuation, AOL and Backup operations.
4.9. Support During Activation of The Emergency Landing Surface (ELS). During ELS
activation, the WF will provide wind information to the ATC Tower and other appropriate
agencies when required.

Terms
Aircraft Mishap—Any event resulting in damage to, or destruction of an aircraft to include
lightning strikes, inadvertent departure from paved runway or taxiway surface, and forced
landings due to an IFE.
Airfield Services Element—This element of weather support expands the traditional observing
function at the airfield by infusing the elements of the meteorological watch and resource
protection roles. The Airfield Services Element will function as the ―eyes forward‖ for the
servicing OWS and in many cases will serve as the primary point of contact for the collaborative
forecast effort to include resource protection for an installation. The Airfield Services Element
also interfaces with the Supervisor of Flying, and provides over-the-counter transient mission
briefings during the 8 FW flying window.
Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA)—AFWA is a field-operating agency responsible for all
meteorological services for the Air Force. It includes a strategic weather center at Offutt AFB
NE, providing strategic atmospheric data and strategic analysis/forecast products required by the
regional OWS’s and the WFs worldwide. AFWA provides the centralized repository for global
observations and forecasts that are data based at AFWA and, in turn, disseminated to DOD
 40                                                               8FWI15-101 17 APRIL 2012


weather data users worldwide. In addition to global observations and forecasts collected from
worldwide sources, AFWA collects meteorological satellite data from multiple sources. Based
on global analysis of available data, AFWA creates global analysis and forecast products to meet
the strategic forecast requirements of its supported units.
Air Report (AIREP)—A pilot report made over areas where weather information is limited or
nonexistent (e.g., over an ocean).
Actual Lead Time (ALT):—The elapsed time between the issuance of a warning or watch and
the time of the first event occurrence.
Cloud Ceiling—Height of the base of a cloud deck that covers at least 5/8 of the sky.
Desired Lead Time (DLT):—The amount of advance notice an agency has identified it requires
for preparations prior to the onset of a particular weather phenomenon.
Issue Time—The time an agency is notified of a watch, warning, or advisory via the designated
primary notification method. When notified via N-TFS, the issue time is the time the watch,
warning, or advisory was transmitted. When more than one agency is notified, the issue time is
the time the last agency is notified. Follow-up notifications made in addition to the primary
notification method are not considered when determining issue time.
Mission Weather Element—This element of weather support provides MEFs for the
operational decision cycle of their host or parent unit function as a mission weather element.
This element also provides MEFs for sortie planning, generation, and execution.
Notice to Airmen (NOTAM)—A notice containing information concerning the establishment,
condition, or change in any aeronautical facility, service, procedures, or hazard, the timely
knowledge of which is essential to personnel concerned with flight operations.
Runway Visual Range (RVR)—The maximum distance for takeoff or landing at which the
runway, or specified lights or markers delineating it, can be seen from a position above a
specified point on its center line at a height corresponding to the average eye level of pilots at
touch-down.
Staff Weather Element—This element of weather support provides leadership and management
of unit activities, as well as functioning as a direct interface with the host or parent unit’s
commander and staff, and provide direct support to command, control, and planning functions.
Timing Error—The difference between the forecast time of occurrence and the actual time of
occurrence. Timing error is positive (+) if the event occurred later than forecast and negative (-)
if it occurred earlier than forecast.
Valid Time (VT)—The time in which a weather watch, warning, or advisory is in effect. The
start time of the VT is when the phenomenon is expected to first occur. The end time of the VT
is when the phenomenon is expected to cease and no longer occur.
Weather Watch:—Weather watch is a special notice provided to a supported agency that alerts
them to the potential for weather conditions of such intensity as to pose a hazard to life or
property exists. The weather watch can be thought of as a ―heads up‖ so agencies may consider
required protective actions should an actual weather warning be issued later.
Weather Warning (WW):—Weather warning is a special notice provided to a supported
agency that gives them advance notification (with sufficient time to allow protective actions to
8FWI15-101 17 APRIL 2012                                                                         41


be taken) that weather conditions of such intensity as to pose a hazard to life or property are
expected to directly effects a designated geographical area or directly effects an area within a set
nautical mile distance of a designated location. Weather warnings specify type of condition,
intensity and duration.
Weather Advisories (WA): Weather advisory is a special notice provided to a supported
agency that notifies them of non—severe weather conditions that could affect their operations
are occurring within a designated geographic area or within a set nautical mile distance of a
designated location.

              A2.1.6.1.3. Lightning detection equipment indicates lightning strikes with 5NM of
              the airfield.
              A2.1.6.1.4. VCTS will not be reported if thunder is heard and the location of the
              storm cannot be determined (e.g., no radar or lighting detector). Instead, if thunder is
              heard and the location is unknown, the thunderstorm will be reported as occurring "at
              the station."
       A2.1.6.2. Ends 15 minutes after last occurrence of the above criteria.
NOTE: A special observation is not required to report the beginning of a new thunderstorm is
one is currently reported.
   A2.1.7. Precipitation
       A2.1.7.1. Hail begins or ends.
       A2.1.7.2. Freezing precipitation begins, ends or changes intensity.
       A2.1.7.3. Any other type of precipitation begins or ends (i.e., rain, drizzle, snow, etc.).

NOTE: Except for freezing rain, freezing drizzle, and hail, a SPECI is not required for changes
in type (e.g., drizzle changing to snow grains) or the beginning or ending of one type while
another is in progress (e.g., snow changing to rain and snow).

   19)
       A2.1.9.1. Disseminate a special observation within 15 minutes after returning to duty
       following a break in observing coverage or augmentation unless a METAR is filed during
       that 15-minute period.
       A2.1.9.2. Within 15 minutes of establishing operations in the alternate operating
       location.
   A2.1.10. Aircraft Mishap: Perform only during augmentation procedures.                During
   augmentation, take an aircraft mishap SPECI immediately following notification or sighting
   of an aircraft mishap at or near the observing location unless there has been an intervening
   observation.
   A2.1.11. Miscellaneous: Any other meteorological situation which the Weather Technician
   deems critical to the safety of aircraft operations.

                       LOCAL OBSERVATION REQUIREMENTS

A3.1. A local is an unscheduled observation, reported to the nearest minute, not meeting SPECI
criteria. All LOCAL altimeter setting reports will be prepared and disseminated as soon as
possible after the relevant altimeter setting change is observed. Only take a single element
LOCAL during backup operations of the AMOS pressure sensor. For LOCALs taken in support
of aircraft operations, the code form will be METAR. A METAR or SPECI taken within the
established time interval will meet this requirement.
   A3.1.1. Altimeter (ALSTG): LOCAL altimeter setting observations are taken at an interval
   not to exceed 35 minutes when there has been a change of 0.01 in/Hg or more since the last
   ALSTG value.

               WEATHER WARNING, WATCH, AND ADVISORY CRITERIA

A5.1. Weather Watches/Warnings/Advisories (WWAs) are issued to notify operational
commanders of weather conditions, actual or potential, of such intensity that they pose a hazard
to life, property and/or operations. Commanders use these notices to make decisions impacting
force protection and installation operations.
A5.2. Determining WWA Agency Dissemination:
   A5.2.1. All forecasted weather watches, forecasted weather warnings (WWs) except the
   lightning WW, and forecasted weather advisories (WAs) will be issued by the 17OWS.
   A5.2.2. The lightning WW and all observed WAs will be issued by 8 OSS personnel during
   duty hours. When closed, the 17 OWS will be responsible for these notifications.
   A5.2.3. Certified 8 OSS/OSW personnel have the authority to issue and disseminate
   forecasted WWs in the instances where a forecasted WW has not been issued by the 17
   OWS, and threatening weather conditions that could impact the mission and/or resources are
   imminent, and there is insufficient time to pre-coordinate with the 17th OWS (i.e. tornado
   warning). 8 OSS/OSW personnel will notify the 17 OWS as soon as possible after local
   dissemination to ensure that warning information is entered into the OWS warning tracking
   and verification system and that expanded METWATCH is assumed.
   A5.2.4. Certified 8 OSS/OSW personnel will assume responsibility for all forecast WWAs
   during 17 OWS outages.

                             8 FW WEATHER SENSITIVITIES

A9.1. MissionWatch: MissionWatch is the deliberate process of monitoring terrestrial and
space weather for specific mission-limiting environmental conditions. The MissionWatch
process identifies and alerts decision makers to changes affecting mission success based on pre-
coordinated mission-limiting weather thresholds. It is critical that all on-duty forecasters know
the times, types and operating areas for all missions planned for the day, as well as the weather
thresholds which must be MetWatched for those missions.
A9.2. MissionWatch Procedures:
   A9.2.1. Proper ORM procedures will be utilized to maintain a MissionWatch for the
   missions of the day, with the focus on those critical portions of missions placed at risk due to
   environmental conditions.
   A9.2.2. Risk Categories: Levels of risk for the purpose of ORM procedures will be
   consistent with the applicable mission-limiting weather thresholds.
    Significant Risk - Red             Marginal Risk - Amber                 No Risk - Green

   A9.2.3. The weather flight will utilize the following MissionWatch steps:
       A9.2.3.1. Determine the mission(s) placed at risk due to terrestrial or space weather
       conditions
       A9.2.3.2. Continuously monitor at-risk mission routes, ranges, and divert airfields for
       significant changes. Spot-check low-risk missions.
       A9.2.3.3. Focus on mission-limiting weather thresholds for each specific mission.
       A9.2.3.4. Evaluate for change in risk category and reprioritize MissionWatch as
       appropriate. Notify SOF, FS Top 3s and affected aircrews of weather conditions crossing
       mission-limiting thresholds.
       A9.2.3.5. Integrate weather impacts into the decision-making process to provide
       operational alternatives.
       A9.2.3.6. Update (amend) Mission Weather Products as necessary.
       A9.2.3.7. Continue to monitor missions based on threat.
   A9.2.4. The 17 OWS will be informed when their weather products do not accurately reflect
   observed conditions and impact flight safety.
A9.3. Mission-Limiting Weather Thresholds: The following tables provide weather impacts
for the F-16 and other typical missions conducted by the 8FW at Kunsan AB. AFI 11-214 and
Fighter/Bomber TTP may also serve as a guide. The exact thresholds will depend on mission
type, munitions used, and pilot flying experience. Therefore it is ultimately the mission
commander who declares the weather thresholds for a certain mission.
   A9.3.1. All resource protection thresholds are document in attachment 5, Weather Watch,
   Warning and Advisory criteria.
