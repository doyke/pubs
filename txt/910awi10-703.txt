This instruction implements Air Force Instruction 10-703, Electronic Warfare Integrated
Reprogramming. It establishes procedures for a timely and orderly response to the Electronic
Warfare Integrated Reprogramming (EWIR) process and how the 910 AW will respond to an
EWIR Message. All references to the wing Electronic Combat Officer (ECO) refer to the ECO
or designated alternate (selected 910th Airlift Wing) (AW), Operations Support Squadron (OSS),
and Weapons and Tactics Officer. It applies to all wing organizations with electronic warfare
communication responsibilities. Refer recommended changes and questions about this
publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change Publication as prescribed by AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manual
Program (FMP). Route AF Form 847 to the 773/757 AS/OSK at Youngstown ARS, OH.
Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are
maintained in accordance with AFMAN 37-123 (will convert to AFMAN 33-363), Management
of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule
(RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/.

1. General.
   1.1. EWIR is a communication intensive process demanding close interaction with numerous
   wings agencies and is directed by the wing ECO.
   1.2. EWIR is developed and implemented through PACER WARE (PW) and SERENE
   BYTE (SB) Messages from the Air Mobility Command (AMC) and Headquarters Air Force
   Reserve Command (HQ AFRC).
 2                                                              910AWI10-703 19 JULY 2011


     1.3. During contingency operations or periods of increased operations tempo, the 910th
     Maintenance Group (MXG/CC) may request a waiver letter from the 910th AW/CC excusing
     the 910 MXG from participating in SB exercises.
     1.4. Successful EWIR requires a constant communication between all participants. During
     PW or SB reprogramming, all units must maintain contact with the wing ECO.
2. Responsibilities.
     2.1. The Wing ECO (or alternate):
        2.1.1. Act as the overall coordinator and single Point of Contact (POC) for
        implementation of all 910 AW EWIR activities and update annually the appointment
        letter for the EWIR Action Team members.
        2.1.2. Act as the OPR for this EWIR Instruction, distribute changes, and review annually
               for applicability and/or changes.
        2.1.3. Direct the EWIR Action Team and convene the team upon notification of SB/PW
        from the Electronic Warfare Systems Section (EWFS).
        2.1.4. Review aircrew and intelligence inputs to include Operational Report (OPREPs)
        and Mission Reports (MISREPs) for potential EW system deficiencies and prepare an
        Operational Change Request (OCR) when discrepancies are identified.
        2.1.5. Keep aircrews informed on current and reprogramming EW equipment and their
        capabilities by publishing and briefing the contents of the latest Reprogramming Impact
        Message (RIM) and System Impact Message (SIM) provided by EWFS downloaded from
        the Electronic Combat Support Flight (ECSF) Website via Secret Internet Protocol
        Routing Network (SIPRnet).
        2.1.6. Consolidate all agencies’ reports and prepare a 910 AW After-action Report for
        HQ AFRC within three days of reprogramming termination.
        2.1.7. The Wing ECO will send out the Unit Loading Message (ULM) received from
        EWFS to the MAJCOM.
     2.2. 910 MXS Electronic Warfare Systems Shop (MXMV) (EWFS):
        2.2.1. Ensure all personnel assigned are familiar with all applicable EWIR documents,
        procedures, and operating instructions. The NCOIC of EWFS will update annually the
        PW/SB Capability letter and notify the ECO of any changes in the EWIR capability or
        personnel. NOTE: Most PACER WARE updates are issued as Time Compliance
        Technical Orders (TCTOs). PACER WARE is a real world reprogramming or minor
        hardware changes that are required due to changing operational requirements. The TCTO
        will establish the timelines for the implementation of the PACER WARE update. The
        Avionics Flight will ensure that the ECO is notified prior to the implementation of any
        TCTO that would affect the operation of the Aircraft Defensive/Countermeasures
        systems.
        2.2.2. EW personnel will monitor the EWIR Operations PACERWARE Website via
        Non-Classified Internet Protocol Routing Network (NIPRnet) for PW or SB messages
        applicable to 910 AW and will determine the action necessary based on the message type.
910AWI10-703 19 JULY 2011                                                                  3


     2.2.3. Upon receipt of PW or SB message, it will be documented on the EWIR check
     sheet. EW personnel will contact the Electronic Combat Officer (ECO) to convene the
     EWIR Action Team. EW personnel will contact maintenance management to schedule
     meeting to discuss EWIR Action Team’s decision and impact to maintenance and
     aircraft.
     2.2.4. PW, SB and local exercise messages, which are informative in nature only (i.e.
     RIM, SIM or Maintenance Impact Message [MIM]), will be read and stored while
     awaiting the implementation (IMP) message from the implementation authority (i.e.
     AMC or AFRC).
     2.2.5. EW personnel will ensure equipment necessary for reprogramming is available
     and operational to support reprogramming at home station and deployed locations.
     2.2.6. EW personnel will access the SIPRnet and login to the ECSF website to download
     software changes specified in the (IMP). EW personnel will prepare the required
     equipment for reprogramming aircraft EW systems. Equipment preparation will include
     but will not be limited to recharging Common Aircraft Portable Reprogramming
     Equipment (CAPRE) AN/PYM-1 battery, installing hard drive and copying software
     change file(s) to the classified CAPRE hard drive, and checking in the files within the
     CAPRE host software IAW T.O. 33D7-3-27-1 sections 2.4.4.3 through 2.4.5.2.2.
     2.2.7. EW personnel will not load the software change on any aircraft EW systems
     unless specifically authorized to do so by the implementation authority in the IMP and
     with the approval of the Wing ECO.
     2.2.8. After receiving approval, EW personnel will coordinate with the Avionics Flight
     Chief to schedule and coordinate aircraft for Electronic Warfare system (EWFS)
     reprogramming as directed in message instructions. The Avionics Branch Chief will
     coordinate with MXG/CC, MXS Superintendent, Plans and Scheduling, Quality
     Assurance (QA), Maintenance Operation Center (MOC), and Aircraft Maintenance
     Squadron (AMXS). A detailed plan and timeline will be created and provided to EW
     personnel.
     2.2.9. EW personnel will provide the EWIR unit data sheet indicating any problems
     encountered to the Wing ECO within 72 hours of date specified in IMP. The unit data
     sheet will include the Date Time Group (DTG), message type and EW system affected
     for each message received. Procedures and expertise in performing these functions can
