2.5. Stan/Eval Visits (SEVs). HHQ Stan/Eval staffs may visit units during the administration
of formal inspections (e.g. Unit Compliance Inspections), Staff Assistance Visits (SAVs), or in
an informal capacity, as specified in MAJCOM supplements.
2.5. (AFMC)Stan/Eval Visits (SEVs) AFMC/A3V is tasked by AFMC/CC through
AFMC/A3 to conduct unit Performance Evaluations (PE). Performance Evaluations will
consist of two parts. Part 1 consists of Aircrew/Jumper Performance (APE/JPE) and Aircrew
Flight Equipment Performance (AFEP). Part I is a graded event. Part II is a Policy/Process
Assessment (PPA). Part II is not a graded event, but will review all flight related operations
processes. AFMC/A3V will evaluate (APE/JPE plus AFEP) each unit approximately once
every 24 months. The PPA will be completed within 12 months of the Part I Performance
Evaluation. Documentation and process verification with USAF (AFI 11-series), AFMC and unit
guidance is one objective of this program. The more critical objective of the PE is to evaluate
aircrew, jumper and AFE personnel performance in the conduct of their mission. All AFMC
flying units and Air Force Reserve units under AFMC Operational Control (OPCON) are subject
to the provisions of this instruction. NAF coordination for AFRC units under OPCON to AFMC
is not required. AFIS inspections are conducted by the AFMC/IG, but may be augmented as
needed by AFMC/A3V.
   2.5.1. (AFMC) AFMC/IG inspects AFMC units for compliance. All aircrew flying related
   records are considered within the scope of AFMC/A3V PPAs and APE/JPE/AFEPs. There
   are eight major operations areas that are covered by this Stan/Eval program; aircrew
   performance, jumper performance, flight operations, flying training, aircrew standardization-
   evaluation, contractor operations, aircrew flight equipment, and Aviation Resource
   Management. APE/JPE and AFEP are the key tools to evaluate the performance of unit
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011                                                             15


  personnel accomplishing the unit assigned mission. All AFMC flying organizations and AF
  Reserve units under AFMC operational control are subject to APE/JPE and AFEP program.
  2.5.2. (AFMC) Units will be evaluated (PE Part I) in a vulnerability window of 12-30
  months and on an approximate 24-month command average cycle. Individual unit
  evaluations will be scheduled based on past performance with stronger performance trending
  toward the 30-month interval. Units will be given little to no-notice (24 hours minimum) of
  commencement of PE Part I (APE/JPE and AFEP). The Chief of AFMC/A3V will provide
  formal notification to the supervision of the unit by any communications means available or
  necessary. The four evaluation subareas of PE Part I are testing, publications, aircrew/jumper
  and AFE evaluations. The exams, publications checks, and EPEs that occur during a visit
  may be recorded and used as requisites for a subsequent instrument or qualification
  evaluations, provided all other requisites are completed within the guidelines established by
  this publication. Initiation of a PE Part I will typically flow from testing and publications
  review on the first day to aircrew/jumper evaluations and AFE evaluations on subsequent
  days until the specific evaluation quantity objectives have been met. PE Part I team travel
  costs are funded by AFMC/A3.
     2.5.2.1. (AFMC) Testing: Aircraft MQF, Non-MQF aircraft knowledge, flight
     instructions and published guidance, and aircraft CAPS/Boldface are components of
     aircrew testing. Testing is required for all qualified aircrew members who are not TDY,
     DNIF to quarters, on emergency/planned leave, or released for participation in an actual
     test mission. At least 90 percent of available aircrew must test for the unit to complete the
     APE/JPE testing evaluation with a rating of excellent or higher. All qualified aircrew
     members must test unless excused by the Team Chief. Contractor aircrews will test in
     their respective crew position/aircraft specialty, or IAW procedures established and
     coordinated with the GFR. All aircrew members who are multiple qualified must
     complete tests for each aircraft in which they are qualified. In addition to test questions
     all aircrew members whose aircraft have BOLDFACE/CAPS will complete a written
     examination on those items. Explosive and Ground Safety are components of AFE
     testing.
         2.5.2.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Testing MQF or BOLDFACE/CAPS failures will be
         reported to the flying unit commander immediately. Aircrew who fail the MQF
         testing portion or BOLDFACE/CAPS will be grounded immediately and re-evaluated
         prior to the next flight. An unqualified (3) AF Form 8/8a, Certificate of Aircrew
         Qualification, will be completed by AFMC/A3V and placed in the aircrew member’s
         FEF.
         2.5.2.1.2. (Added-AFMC) For rated officers (Pilots, WSOs, Navigators/CSOs),
         tests will be 40 questions; 20 derived from aircraft specific MQFs, 10 non-MQF
         questions derived from the aircraft specific flight manuals covering notes, warnings,
         cautions; operations limits; normal and emergency procedures; and 10 questions
         derived from the following flight/instrument instructions, and other applicable
         guidance: AFI 11-202 Vol 3, General Flight Rules; AFI 11-2 FT Vol 3, AFMC Flight
         Test Operations Procedures; AFMAN 11-217, Instrument Flight Procedures; AFI
         11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground; AFH 11-203, Weather for
         Aircrews; APAM 11-216, Air Navigation, and other applicable guidance such as unit
         supplements and local aircrew guides (IFG) etc.

        2.5.2.1.3. (Added-AFMC) For career enlisted aviator (CEA) primary aircrew tests
        will be 30 questions; 20 questions derived from the aircraft specific MQF, and 10
        questions derived from the aircraft specific flight manual covering notes, warnings,
        cautions; operations limits; normal and emergency procedures.
        2.5.2.1.4. (Added-AFMC) For career enlisted aviator and rated mission aircrew
        (CSO, FA, ABM, ASO, MCC, AMT, Scanner, etc) and Non-Rated (X-prefix) tests
        will be 20 questions derived from the aircraft specific MQF.
        2.5.2.1.5. (Added-AFMC) Government Civilians and Contractor personnel will test
        according to their like military specialties as listed above.
        2.5.2.1.6. (Added-AFMC) The MQF portion of the tests administered during an
        evaluation will qualify as the closed book portion of the instrument/qualification
        recurring evaluation requisites. At the unit commander’s discretion, they may also
        count as a periodic test to be used as part of the unit go/no-go process.
     2.5.2.2. (AFMC) Publications
        2.5.2.2.1. (Added-AFMC) Flight Publications: Unit (FCIF Library) and individual
        flight publications, checklists, and in-flight guide. Each primary aircrew member’s
        publications (Flight Manual, Checklists, and In-flight Guides) will be evaluated for
        completeness and currency. At least 90 percent of available aircrew publications must
        be evaluated for the unit to complete the flight publication portion of the APE/JPE
        with a rating of excellent or higher. The quantity of publications varies from aircraft
        to aircraft; however, expect all technical orders, checklists, and in-flight guides to be
        evaluated. Units may maintain individual aircrew technical order publications using
        electronic means. Each individual’s storage media (typically CD-ROM) will be
        provided for publications evaluation. Assigned aircrew may be asked to demonstrate
        use of the CD-ROM/Electronic Technical Order in an appropriate viewing device,
        such as a desktop computer or Electronic T.O. viewer and knowledge of outstanding
        supplements and/or operating procedures. Units may use common access media to
        maintain publications as well (typically SharePoint or other common use process). If
        this process is used, the unit must have control processes in place. The control process
        must ensure the TO data is protected from unauthorized disclosure/distribution.
        Control of the TOs will meet the requirements based on the distribution statement on
        the most restrictive TO. Any flight crew member who requests a personal copy will
        have it provided.
        2.5.2.2.2. (Added-AFMC) Common Use Publications. Publications in the unit for
        common use will be evaluated for completeness and currency. Examples of common
        use publications are FCIF library, fly-away kits, Duty/SOF desk, and AFE libraries.
     2.5.2.3. (AFMC) Aircrew Evaluations: Qualification, Instrument, Spot, Instructor,
     Mission.
        2.5.2.3.1. (Added-AFMC) Flight and ground evaluations will be administered
        during each evaluation visit. The number of evaluations given is based on aircrew
        and aircraft availability. While no minimum number of evaluations is required, it is
        desired to evaluate the unit supervision, unit chief of Stan/Eval, and other unit aircrew
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011                                                           17


        with a minimum goal of 30% (by aircraft and crew position) of assigned and attached
        aircrew receiving an evaluation.
        2.5.2.3.2. (Added-AFMC) Instrument, qualification and spot checks will be
        administered. Spot checks may be administered by an AFMC/A3V designated
        evaluator who is not be qualified in the evaluation aircraft, but holds a different
        aircraft qualification. SEFE objectivity checks will be given to evaluate unit SEFE
        compliance and judgment when performing the evaluator role.
        2.5.2.3.3. (Added-AFMC) Ground emergency procedure evaluations (EPE) will
        also be administered to evaluate aircrew knowledge of emergency procedures,
        general knowledge, and CRM principles. This EPE will cover as a minimum all
        boldface/CAPS (if applicable), knowledge of aircraft systems, plus various
        emergency situations which could occur during the performance of the unit’s primary
        mission.
        2.5.2.3.4. (Added-AFMC) Flight evaluations accomplished during APE/JPE will be
        documented with AF Forms 8/8a’s. AFMC/A3V evaluators will prepare the AF
        Form 8/8a on the unit examinee to include examiner remarks and Block 1 signature.
        All SPOT evaluations will be completed and the AF Form 8/8a will be closed out.
        Units being evaluated will accomplish all other AF Forms 8/8a actions. The unit’s
        process for logging, preparing, and tracking unit prepared AF Forms 8/8a will be
        observed as part of the formal unit evaluation.
     2.5.2.4. (AFMC) AFE Task Evaluations
        2.5.2.4.1. (Added-AFMC) Task evaluations will be administered during each
        evaluation visit. The number of evaluations given is based on the number of assigned
        personnel and tasks applicable to the unit. There is no minimum goal for task
        evaluations.
        2.5.2.4.2. (Added-AFMC) Task evaluations of the AFE/SERE course instructors
        will be completed as applicable to the unit. Course and instructors evaluated will be
        selected by the AFE FAM. Equipment will be assessed through formal task
        evaluations. Explosive and Ground Safety programs and procedures will be validated
        by technician task evaluations. Equipment and technicians to perform task evaluation
        will be selected by AFE FAM.
        2.5.2.4.3. (Added-AFMC) All task evaluations will be documented on an AF Form
        803. Instructor evaluations will be documented on an Instructor Evaluation Form.
     2.5.2.5. (AFMC) PE Ratings. The APE/JPE overall rating is derived from combining
     unit performance in the three sub-areas of testing, publications, and evaluations. These
     three are weighted by the Chief of AFMC/A3V based on specific objective criteria
     contained in AFMC/A3V OI 11-1. The aircrew and jumper performance during
     evaluations is the more significant factor followed by testing and lastly publications. The
     AFEP overall rating is derived from combining unit performance in the three sub-areas of
     testing, common use publications, and task evaluations. These thee are weighted by the
     Chief of AFMC/A3V based on objective criteria contained in AFMC/A3V OI 11-1.
     AFEP results will be reported as s separate grade. The unit grades assigned will follow

     coordinate with local unit commanders for aircrew members to accomplish continuation
     training during HHQ visits.
  2.5.3. (AFMC) Policy/Process Assessment
     2.5.3.1. (AFMC) Unit PPAs will be scheduled 12 months following the last PE Part I.
     This will provide a PPA opportunity on a command average 24-month cycle and execute
     a review of the unit as they enter the next PE Part I zone of 12-30 months. Exception: 412
     OG and subordinate units: PPA will be a single event and scheduled via A3V and 412
     OG coordination on a 24-month cycle. A minimum footprint concept will be utilized,
     typically one aircrew and one flight equipment A3V staff member for 2 working days per
     squadron/det unit. PPA team travel costs are funded by AFMC/A3
     2.5.3.2. (AFMC) Operations areas are flight operations, aircrew training, Stan/Eval,
     contractor operations, aircrew flight equipment. AFE/OSL will be assessed based on four
     sub areas: AFE Management, Training, Equipment, and Safety. Aviation Resource
     Management (ARM) will be assessed as part of the PPA. Local Host ARM, Squadron
     ARM, and Tenant ARM, will be evaluated as applicable. All processes will be assessed
     by validating all policy/processes mandated by applicable 11-series AFIs and AFMC
     supplements. ARM training will be evaluated by task evaluations and documented on the
     AF Form 803. PPA results will be documented with a letter report to the unit from the
     PPA team chief. The PPA will not assign grades. Formal responses to the report are not
     required unless specifically required in the report. Formal responses are generally
     associated with repeat write-ups or issues affecting safety of flight. Unit completed Self-

       (FEFs). If not maintained by the squadron Stan/Eval function, maintain unit FEFs.
       3.2.2.4. Establish procedures for requisite Aircrew Exams (see Chapter 6).
       3.2.2.5. Establish and maintain a trend program.
          3.2.2.5.1. Scope will include trend analysis of all evaluations.
          3.2.2.5.1. (AFMC) Unit trend programs will consist of tracking flight evaluations,
          flight evaluation discrepancies, and ground requisite examinations.
          3.2.2.5.2. For units with more than one type of MDS and/or crew positions, combine
          discrepancies common to all MDSs/crew positions to determine trends (e.g.,
          instrument procedures).
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011                                                        21


         3.2.2.5.3. For Formal Training Units (FTUs) and Combat Crew Training Squadrons
         (CCTSs), maintain separate trend data for students and instructors.
         3.2.2.5.4. When trends are noted, recommend corrective action and assign an
         OPR/Office of Collateral Responsibility (OCR).
         3.2.2.5.5. Report trends and status to the OG/CC during the SEB until closed (see
         Attachment 2). Maintain an archive of trend data for at least one year from the date

     3.2.2.7. Conduct SEBs and document IAW Attachment 2 and MAJCOM supplement.
     3.2.2.7. (AFMC) All units will forward the current meeting minutes to AFMC/A3V.
     For small units (10 or less aircrew) where a Formal standardization evaluation board
     (SEB) would not be practical, a Stan/Eval status letter will be generated to inform unit
     personnel on Stan/Eval related issues. This letter will encompass all the requirements
     listed in Attachment 2. These minutes will be kept for 1 year.
     3.2.2.8. Establish and maintain the unit FCIF program.
     3.2.2.9. Establish procedures to manage the flight publications program IAW AFI 11-
     215 and TO 00-5-1.
     3.2.2.10. Coordinate on and process applicable AF Forms 847 through Stan/Eval
     channels and IAW AFI 11-215. ANG units will utilize the NAF/MAJCOM command
     structure with oversight responsibility.
     3.2.2.10. (AFMC) Group Level Standardization/Evaluation (OGVs) organizations will
     advertise the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication program through
     newsletters, SEB and support unit level programs. Units are highly encouraged to use
     electronic AF Forms 847 and e-mail to process and forward AF Forms 847 to
     AFMC/A3V for action.
     3.2.2.11. Ensure annual Military Training Route (MTR) and Air Refueling (AR) Track
     reviews (for the MTRs and ARs for which the unit is OPR) are accomplished and
     documented IAW AFI 13-201, Airspace Management. Document status of reviews in the
     SEB minutes (see Attachment 2).
     3.2.2.12. Manage the Operations Supervision program as applicable IAW AFI 11-418,
     Operations Supervision.
  3.2.3. OGV Organization. OGV staff will consist of a Chief of Stan/Eval and should
  include at least one flight examiner per crew position per MDS. Manning and organization
  may be adjusted IAW MAJCOM supplement or with OG/CC approval. If the OG/CC
  approves adjustments, notify the NAF and MAJCOM Stan/Eval functions, and document in
  the SEB minutes.
  3.2.3. (AFMC) Due to limited manning, OG commanders will determine manning levels

                                           Chapter 5

                       AIRCREW QUALIFICATION EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. The Aircrew Stan/Eval Program utilizes aircrew qualification evaluations to
ensure qualification of aircrew members and supplementary evaluations to ensure
standardization of operations.
   5.1.1. To promote efficient use of flying resources, accomplish aircrew qualification
   evaluations concurrently, whenever practical.
   5.1.1. (AFMC) A post flight video review does not meet the intent of an in-flight evaluation
   and may not be used as an alternate evaluation method.
   5.1.2. Evaluations in multiple crew positions will be addressed in MAJCOM supplements.
   For specialized aircrew, see Chapter 8. For guidance on supplementary evaluations, see
   Chapter 9.
   5.1.2. (AFMC) All AFMC aircrew (rated, CEA, and non-rated) require an evaluation
   consisting ground and/or flight phases. Government civilians and contractor aircrew in like
   positions will complete like evaluations. Examples of like duties/positions for non-rated
   aircrew include flight test engineer, test director, test conductor or instrumentation. There are
   no crewmembers that gain qualification through an examination only. The guidance in
   Chapter 8 is not applicable to AFMC flight operations.
5.2. Categories. Aircrew qualification evaluations are divided into five categories
(Qualification (QUAL), Instrument (INSTM), Mission (MSN), Instructor (INSTR), and SPOT)
each consisting of two structured phases, ground and flight. (EXCEPTION: SPOT evaluations
may consist of either a ground or flight phase.) Each phase requires the completion of requisite
tasks (see paragraph 5.5). (EXCEPTION: a SPOT evaluation has no requisite tasks.)
5.2. (AFMC)Profiles for qualification/instrument/instructor evaluations will be conducted
in accordance with the prescribed worksheets (found on the AFMC/A3V website) for each
aircraft and crew position and with the applicable flight test grading criteria contained in
AFI 11-2FTV2. Conduct difference/conversion evaluations IAW MDS-specific guidance.
Recurring evaluations are then conducted in any series of a particular mission/design aircraft in
which qualified.
      5.2.1. QUAL Evaluations.
         5.2.1.1. Purpose. Ensure basic qualification in an MDS and/or crew position.
         5.2.1.2. Execution. All aircrew will complete a periodic QUAL evaluation in their
         primary assigned aircraft/crew position as specified in the applicable AFI 11-2MDS, Vol
         2. QUAL evaluations may be combined with INSTM and/or MSN evaluations IAW AFI
         11-2MDS, Vol 2. See Chapter 8 for specialized aircrew.
         5.2.1.2. (AFMC) Some crew specialties may be combined if the duties of both crew
         positions are accomplished on the same flight. (Examples: B-1 OSO/ DSO; AC-130
         Nav/FCO).
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011                                                             29


     5.2.1.3. (Added-AFMC) Non-Rated Aircrew Qualification. AFMC assigned/attached
     Non-rated aircrew (K-, Q-, or X-prefix) do not require a flight phase for the qualification
     evaluation. The evaluation will, as a minimum, consist of a closed book examination,
     Boldface/CAPs (if applicable), and an aircraft egress / emergency equipment ground
     evaluation completed on a representative aircraft. Egress certified simulators for ejection
     seat aircraft may be used in conjunction with or in lieu of an actual aircraft. Any pilot of
     an ejection seat aircraft that is a certified evaluator may complete the evaluation. Any
     aircrew member that can complete ship side egress requirements that is a certified
     evaluator may complete the evaluation (i.e. C-130J Evaluator Loadmaster certified to
     instruct egress may complete the QUAL evaluation for a Flight Test Engineer). Units
     may be more restrictive if mission requirements dictate. (Open and closed book
     examinations, flight evaluation, etc). Detailed requirements by position will be listed in
     unit supplements.         There is no requirement for instructor and/or evaluator
     qualification/certification for these crew positions.
     5.2.1.4. (Added-AFMC) Flight Surgeons assigned/attached to AFMC flying
     organizations will comply with the guidance for Non-Rated Aircrew Qualification listed
     above.
  5.2.2. INSTM Evaluations.
     5.2.2.1. Purpose. Obtain/maintain instrument qualification in order to operate under
     Instrument Flight Rules (IFR)
     5.2.2.2. Execution. All USAF pilots (and other pilots flying operationally with the
     USAF, e.g., exchange pilots) will obtain/maintain instrument qualification by
     successfully completing a periodic INSTM evaluation.
     5.2.2.2. (AFMC) Instrument flight evaluations are required for all initial aircraft
     qualifications and re-qualifications. If the aircrew member has not completed IRC within
     the previous four quarters, the course must be completed prior to the flight portion of the
     AF Form 8 evaluation.
        5.2.2.2.1. EXCEPTION: Indoctrination flyers who fly under the provisions of AFI
        11-401, Aviation Management; USAF Test Pilot School students; TG-series aircraft
        pilots; T-41/51/52 pilots.
        5.2.2.2.2. Pilots assigned to excepted aircraft who may also be assigned to other
        aircraft that are not excepted will maintain instrument qualification, but will take their
        INSTM checkride in the non-excepted aircraft.
        5.2.2.2.3. A pilot with a revoked or expired instrument qualification will not fly
        under IFR except under supervised status in a training program leading to
        requalification. (Does not apply to pilots in excepted situations listed above.)
        5.2.2.2.4. (Added-AFMC) Navigators/CSOs with flight instruments used for
        navigation at their station must attend a periodic instrument refresher. Complete an
        instrument exam as a requisite to the qualification evaluation. If the aircrew member
        has not completed IRC within the previous four quarters, the course must be
        completed prior to the flight portion for all initial qualification or RQ AF Form 8
        evaluations.
30                                                 AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011


           5.2.2.2.5. (Added-AFMC) Weapon Systems Officers and navigators having flight
           controls at their duty station will complete the pilot instrument exam as a requisite to
           the qualification evaluation. If multiple qualified, complete the instrument exam in
           phase with the qualification evaluation on the primary aircraft. If the aircrew member
           has not completed IRC within the previous four quarters, the course must be
           completed prior to the flight portion for all initial qualification or RQ AF Form 8
           evaluations.
 5.2.3. MSN Evaluations.
        5.2.3.1. Purpose. To ensure qualification to employ the aircrew’s assigned weapon
        system/crew position in the accomplishment of the unit’s operational or Designated
        Operational Capability (DOC) statements mission(s).
        5.2.3.1. (AFMC) The requirement for a mission evaluation for AFMC aircrews is
        waived. However, evaluators should attempt to include mission type events on a
        qualification evaluation. Mission type events may be any Phase II event such as
        aerobatics, confidence maneuvers, safety chase, approaches to stalls, BFM, flight test
        techniques, formation, basic weapons deliveries, and functional checks, etc. The Mission
        Section of the evaluation sheets contains four areas to be evaluated if mission type events
        are accomplished on a qualification evaluation.
        5.2.3.2. Execution. All aircrew members maintaining Mission Ready (MR)/Combat
        Mission Ready (CMR) or Basic Mission Capable (BMC) status (IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 1,
        Aircrew Training) will complete a periodic MSN evaluation as specified in the applicable
        AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
           5.2.3.2.1. EXCEPTION: The requirement for a MSN evaluation may be waived for
           those aircraft where performance of normal operational, test, and training sorties
           involves tasks covered during the accomplishment of an INSTM and/or QUAL
           evaluation as specified in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2. Document waiver via memorandum
           for record (MFR) to be included in the FEF IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2. HQ
           USAF/A3O-A approval is not required for such waivers. Specify approval
           procedures in MAJCOM supplements to this instruction or in the applicable AFI 11-
           2MDS Vol 2.
           5.2.3.2.2. The MSN evaluation should reflect the type and difficulty of tasks required
           in fulfillment of the aircraft’s operational or DOC statement missions.
     5.2.4. INSTR Evaluations.
        5.2.4.1. Purpose. To qualify aircrew as instructors in their weapon system/crew position
        by focusing primarily on the examinees instructional ability.
        5.2.4.2. Execution. Aircrew members obtaining/regaining instructor qualification in a
        weapon system/crew position must complete evaluations of instructional capability in
        that weapon system/crew position. Guidance for specialized, universal, and/or multiple
        qualified aircrew will be specified in MAJCOM Supplements and/or AFI 11-2MDS Vol
        2. EXCEPTION: For units undergoing aircraft conversion, when a complement of
        current and qualified Air Force instructors does not exist to accomplish initial unit
        instructor qualification, with MAJCOM/A3 approval and Lead MAJCOM/A3
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011                                                             31


     coordination the OG/CC may establish an Initial cadre (minimum required for initial
     conversion) of flight instructors who do not require an INIT INSTR evaluation. Initial
     cadre must be current and qualified instructors in a US Air Force aircraft who will remain
     in the same crew position on the new aircraft. OG/CCs will notify MAJCOMs and
     provide initial cadre list for each crew position with current qualification and total flight
     and instructor hours. OG/CCs will use discretion when establishing initial cadre
     instructors and consider availability of suitable instructor courses. See also paragraph
     5.13.
     5.2.4.2. (AFMC) Whenever possible this evaluation will be conducted from the
     instructor position. If the cockpit layout and/or visibility have differences that are
     significant enough to affect instrument maneuvers or landing techniques, units will add
     appropriate grading areas to evaluate these differences. The instructor upgrade flight
     evaluation requirements apply to all primary aircrew (rated or CEA) positions. Instructor
     comments must be included and described in adequate detail in the mission description
     area of the AF Form 8. As a minimum, the graded areas will include the Ground Phase,
     General, Qualification, and Instructor as defined in the applicable portion of AFI 11-2FT
     Vol 2, Flight Test Aircrew Evaluation Criteria. When instructor status is accepted from
     another MAJCOM, any additional items required to meet AFMC standards (i.e.., Rear
     Cockpit landings in the F-16) will be trained and evaluated IAW SPOT Evaluation
     criteria. See AFI 11-2FT Vol 1, MDS attachments for specific details and requirements.
        5.2.4.2.1. Accomplish INIT INSTR evaluations on actual instructional missions
        whenever possible. When students are not available or mission/crew composition
        requirements prevent inclusion of students, another crewmember or the evaluator will
        serve as the student.
        5.2.4.2.2. Evaluations of instructor qualification will be conducted during all
        subsequent periodic evaluations.
        5.2.4.2.3. Instructors who expire on their INSTM, QUAL, and/or MSN checkrides
        evaluations are not qualified to instruct in those areas (e.g. if an IP expires on his/her
        MSN zone, he/she may still instruct in INSTM/QUAL-related areas as specified in
        AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2).
  5.2.5. SPOT Evaluations –Flight or Ground (Optional).
     5.2.5.1. Purpose. Evaluate a specific event or requirement without intending to satisfy
     the requirements of a periodic evaluation and/or an initial INSTR evaluation.
     5.2.5.2. Execution. A SPOT has no specific requisites, unless specified in MAJCOM
     supplements, but may be No Notice IAW paragraph 5.2.6.3.
        5.2.5.2.1. An examinee may utilize a SPOT evaluation to update a
        QUAL/INSTM/MSN evaluation expiration date provided all requirements for the
        evaluation are completed within the periods described in paragraph 5.8 (document on
        the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5).
            5.2.5.2.1.1. OG/CCs may authorize additional flights in order to help the aircrew
            accomplish periodic requirements (document on the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph
            7.3.7.3.5).
32                                              AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011


            5.2.5.2.1.2. When the flight examiner administering a SPOT evaluation is not
            qualified in the MDS (e.g. a Senior flight examiner), the evaluation will not be
            credited towards a periodic evaluation.
     5.2.5.3. Any qualifying event and/or evaluations not listed in paragraphs 5.2.1 through
     5.2.4 will be documented as a SPOT evaluation.
     5.2.5.4. (Added-AFMC) Standardization/Evaluation            Flight    Examiner      (SEFE)
     Objectivity Evaluations. Senior Flight examiner, OGV, AFMC/A3V, CCP, and HHQ
     designated augmentees administering evaluations on behalf of AFMC/A3V can
     administer a SPOT evaluation. Evaluations may be conducted in flight or ground
     evaluations. The purpose of these evaluations is to evaluate flight examiners within a unit
     on their ability to comply with higher headquarters (HHQ) and local Stan/Eval directives.
     Properly brief and debrief an examinee, correctly identify discrepancies, award the
     correct grade for each evaluated area, award the appropriate overall grade, and, if
     required, assign appropriate additional training. These evaluations are “over-the-
     shoulder” type evaluations and may include Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPEs),
     qualification, instrument, or instructor evaluations. There are no requisite exams required
     for this evaluation. SEFE Objectivity evaluations will be documented as SPOT
     evaluations in the Flight Phase (or Ground Phase for EPEs) of the AF Form 8.
 5.2.6. Prefixes. The following prefixes will be used, when applicable, to further describe
 the evaluations listed in paragraphs 5.2.1 through 5.2.5:
     5.2.6.1. Initial (INIT). The first evaluation of any type, to include instructor
     qualification, in a specific weapon system/crew position (e.g., INIT QUAL/INSTM, INIT
     MSN, INIT INSTR).
     5.2.6.2. Requalification (RQ). An evaluation administered to remedy a loss of
     qualification due to:
        5.2.6.2.1. Expiration of a required periodic evaluation. The recheck will be IAW the
        guidance for that periodic evaluation.
        5.2.6.2.1. (AFMC) Comply with the requirements of paragraph 5.2.4.2 above for
        instructor requalification evaluations.
        5.2.6.2.2. Loss of currency that requires a requal evaluation (IAW AFI11-2MDS Vol
        1). In this case RQ SPOT will be used for documentation (see paragraph 7.3.5.2.2).
        The recheck profile will be as directed by the SQ/CC and will include, as a minimum,
        those items for which the individual is non-current.
        5.2.6.2.3. A flight recheck following a failed periodic evaluation. The recheck will be
        IAW the provisions of paragraph 5.6.1.
        5.2.6.2.4. Loss of qualification due to a commander-directed downgrade (see
        paragraph 5.9). The recheck profile will be as directed by the commander on the AF
        Form 8/8a (see paragraph 7.4).
        5.2.6.2.5. The RQ prefix will not be used under the following circumstances:
            5.2.6.2.5.1. If the expiration of a required periodic evaluation is due to failure to
            complete one or more of the ground phase requisites (see paragraph 5.5.1), but the
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011                                                            33


             flight evaluation has successfully been completed within the eligibility period and
             the OG/CC determines that qualification will be re-established by completion of
             the ground requisites without re-accomplishment of the flight evaluation.
             5.2.6.2.5.2. To prefix a recheck following a failed INIT evaluation. No
             qualification was achieved, thus requalification is not possible.
      5.2.6.3. No-Notice (N/N).
          5.2.6.3.1. The no-notice evaluation program provides commanders a sampling of
          daily aircrew performance and an assessment of unit training effectiveness.
          5.2.6.3.2. A no-notice evaluation is one where the examinee is notified of the
          evaluation at or after the beginning of normal preparation for the mission. “Normal
          preparation” will be as defined in the MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
          5.2.6.3.3. (Added-AFMC) With prior notification to the unit commander, the
          AFMC Chief of Stan/Eval may direct HHQ designated flight examiners qualified in
          the aircraft and crew position to replace any scheduled primary aircrew prior to flight
          briefing time. Non-HHQ evaluators, at the direction of the OG/CC, may replace any
          scheduled primary aircrew prior to flight briefing time for the purpose of
          administering a no-notice evaluation.
          5.2.6.3.4. (Added-AFMC) No specific requirements are established for the number
          of areas that must be graded on a no-notice evaluation; however, flight examiners will
          evaluate all areas observed and prepare an AF Form 8/8a. When HHQ evaluators fly
          for the purpose of promoting standardization in mission, MDS, or crew functional
          areas, an AF Form 8/8a is not required.
      5.2.6.4. Simulator (SIM). An evaluation where the flight phase requisite is conducted
      in a simulator and/or suitable ATD as defined in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
      5.2.6.5. Multiple Prefixes. More than one prefix may be used to describe an evaluation
      (e.g., N/N SIM SPOT). The applicability of any prefixes to portions of any combined
      evaluations and the purpose for any prefixes (if not obvious by the context of the
      evaluation) will be explained on the AF Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5.
5.3. Grading System.
   5.3.1. A two step grading system is used to evaluate and document aircrew performance.
      5.3.1.1. In the first step, individual grades are assigned to each evaluation requisite to
      include the grading of areas/subareas of aircrew performance against established
      evaluation criteria (see paragraph 5.4). Performance less than fully qualified must be
      documented.
      5.3.1.2. In the second step, an overall qualification level is assigned based on a
      compilation of all individual requisite grades (see paragraph 5.3.3.4).
   5.3.2. Performance Areas/Subareas.
      5.3.2.1. Areas/subareas will have a two-tier (Q/U) or three-tier (Q/Q-/U) grading system.
      Discrepancies will be documented against the established areas/subareas.
34                                              AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011


        5.3.2.1.1. Q indicates the examinee demonstrated both a satisfactory knowledge of
        all required information and performed aircrew duties within the prescribed
        tolerances.
        5.3.2.1.2. Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area/subarea
        tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the flight
        examiner. Deviations must not exceed the prescribed Q- tolerances, jeopardize flight
        safety, or be a breach of flight discipline.
        5.3.2.1.3. U indicates that performance was outside allowable parameters thereby
        compromising flight safety, that deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances
        adversely affected mission accomplishment, and/or evaluated performance
        constituted a breach of flight discipline. An examinee receiving an area/subarea grade
        of U requires debriefing and/or additional training, as determined by the flight
        examiner.
     5.3.2.2. Remedial Action. All grades of Q- or U require remedial action that includes
     either debriefing discrepancies and/or assignment of additional training.
        5.3.2.2.1. Debriefed Discrepancy. Remedial action accomplished during debrief of
        the evaluation wherein the flight examiner provides instruction concerning the
        discrepancy and determines that the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or
        proficiency.
        5.3.2.2.2. Additional Training. Any training recommended by the flight examiner to
        remedy deficiencies identified during an evaluation.
            5.3.2.2.2.1. May include self-study, ground instruction, use of a simulator/ATD
            or flying.
            5.3.2.2.2.2. Will be complete by the last day of the third month following the date
            of the discrepancy (e.g., for an evaluation on 21 Jan 12, additional training must
            be accomplished by 30 Apr 12).
            5.3.2.2.2.2. (AFMC) Additional training required as a result of a Q-2 or Q-3
            evaluation will be completed and a successful requal evaluation (if required)
            accomplished within 60 days. This training will be documented in the individual
            training folder as defined by AFI 11-202, Volume1_AFMCS 1.
            5.3.2.2.2.3. If an aircrew member exceeds the allotted time for completion of
            additional training, the SQ/CC will review the situation and direct appropriate
            action. Document the circumstances with an MFR to be included in the AF Form
            8/8a (see paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
            5.3.2.2.2.4. Document additional training on the AF Form 8/8a IAW paragraphs
            7.3.5.6 and 7.3.7.3.4.
     5.3.2.3. The flight examiner must grade the areas/subareas listed as “required” in the
     general and specific evaluation sections of the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
     5.3.2.4. In addition to required areas/subareas, the flight examiner will grade any
     area/subarea observed during an evaluation if performance in that area/subarea impacts
     the specific evaluation accomplished or overall flight safety.
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011                                                            35


     5.3.2.5. Grading criteria tolerances assume smooth air and stable aircraft conditions.
     5.3.2.6. Minor momentary deviations are acceptable, provided the examinee applies
     prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flight safety. Consider
     cumulative deviations when determining the overall area/subarea grade.
     5.3.2.7. The flight examiner may further identify any area/sub-area as “Commendable”
     if, in the examiner’s determination, the aircrew member has demonstrated exceptional
     skill and knowledge. Document IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5.2.
  5.3.3. Qualification Levels. Qualification levels are assigned both to individual evaluations
  (i.e. flight evals and EPEs) as well as overall performance. Individual evaluations are graded
  as a compilation of all area/sub-area grades. Overall performance is graded as a compilation
  of all requisite tasks associated with the required evaluation. Both individual and overall
  grades are based on the following.
     5.3.3.1. Q1. The aircrew member demonstrated desired performance and knowledge of
     procedures, equipment and directives within tolerances specified in the grading criteria.
     This will be awarded when no discrepancies were noted, but may be awarded when
     discrepancies are noted if:
         5.3.3.1.1. No U grades were awarded for any discrepancy area/sub-area.
         5.3.3.1.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, none of the discrepancies preclude
         awarding of an overall Q1.
         5.3.3.1.3. All areas/sub-areas graded as Q- during the evaluation were cleared during
         the debrief of that evaluation.
     5.3.3.2. Q2. The aircrew member demonstrated the ability to perform duties safely, but:
         5.3.3.2.1. There were one or more area(s)/subarea(s) where additional training was
         assigned.
         5.3.3.2.2. A non-critical area/subarea grade of U was awarded.
         5.3.3.2.3. In the judgment of the flight examiner, a Q2 may be given if there is
         justification based on Q- performance in one or several areas/subareas.
     5.3.3.3. Q3. The aircrew member demonstrated an unacceptable level of safety,
     performance or knowledge.
         5.3.3.3.1. Any critical area graded U requires an overall Q3 (applicable to both flight
         evaluations and EPEs).
         5.3.3.3.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, a Q3 may be given if there is
         justification based on Q-/U performance in one or several non-critical areas/subareas.
     5.3.3.4. Assigning the overall qualification level.
         5.3.3.4.1. The flight-phase flight examiner is the examiner responsible for assigning
         the overall qualification level.
         5.3.3.4.2. An overall grade of Q1 or Q2 will be given only after all evaluation
         requirements (to include requisite examinations) have been completed and given due
         consideration.
 36                                              AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011


          5.3.3.4.3. An overall grade of Q3 may be awarded at any time.
          5.3.3.4.4. While AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 may dictate the highest grade for a flight or
          EPE based on area and subarea performance, flight examiner judgment will
          always be the determining factor in deciding the overall grade.
       5.3.3.5. Exceptionally Qualified (EQ) Designation. An EQ may be given, but will
       only be applied to the overall grade - not to separate requisites. Document on the AF
       Form 8/8a IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.7 and 7.3.7.2. An EQ may be given when:
          5.3.3.5.1. The aircrew member has demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in
          all phases of the evaluation;
          5.3.3.5.2. The aircrew member has not failed any requisite and;
          5.3.3.5.3. The aircrew member received a Q on all areas/subareas evaluated.
5.4. Evaluation Criteria.
   5.4.1. Lead MAJCOMs, in coordination with the applicable user MAJCOMs, will establish
   and maintain standardized INSTM, MSN, QUAL, and INSTR evaluation criteria in the
   appropriate AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2. Lead MAJCOMs will coordinate with the program
   managers of any command-mandated software on any updates of eval criteria to aid in the
   expeditious revision of eval criteria files. Lead MAJCOMs are also responsible for
   coordinating the establishment of the following:
   5.4.1. (AFMC) AFMC evaluation criteria are published in AFI 11-2FT Vol 2.
       5.4.1.1. Areas/subareas including the identification of critical areas and those areas
       required for evaluation completion. These areas/subareas will be arranged into general
       and specific evaluation areas.
          5.4.1.1.1. Critical areas are those areas that, upon failure, would most adversely
          affect the qualification of an aircrew member. Critical areas will include, but are not
          limited to, Airmanship, Safety, and Flight Discipline.
          5.4.1.1.1. (AFMC) Critical areas are listed on AFMC Forms 59 and/or 72.
       5.4.1.2. An area containing criteria for Publications Checks. This is required for QUAL
       evaluations and may be accomplished on other evaluations.
       5.4.1.2. (AFMC) Each aircrew member will submit as a minimum, the applicable Dash-
       1, Dash -1-1 (if issued and required in the performance of duties) and crew position
       checklist as required in AFI 11-2FT Vol 2.
          5.4.1.2.1. Each aircrew member is responsible for maintaining required flight
          publications as outlined in applicable AFI11-2MDS volumes.
          5.4.1.2.2. Q performance requires individual flight publications be current and
          properly posted. In units that do not issue individual aircrew publications, aircrew
          members are still responsible for the accuracy and currency of all publications
          required for the mission.
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011                                                          37


       5.4.1.3. An area containing criteria for Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM)
       IAW AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program, and
       MAJCOM supplements (as applicable).
       5.4.1.4. Criteria to ensure operations comply with National Airspace System (NAS) rules
       and procedures or applicable Host Nation requirements for evaluations administered
       outside of the NAS.
5.5. Requisites. These include both ground and flight phase items. The ground phase, when
required, includes a series of examinations (see Chapter 6) as well as evaluation of aircrew
performance in a controlled emergency procedures environment (i.e. EPEs, see paragraph
5.5.1.2). The flight phase includes an in-flight and/or simulator evaluation of aircrew
performance.
   5.5.1. Ground Phase Requisites.
       5.5.1.1. Ground phase requisites for each evaluation include the following.
          5.5.1.1.1. QUAL: Open book examination, closed book examination,
          Boldface/Critical Action Procedures (CAPs) examination / EPE (if applicable).
          5.5.1.1.2. INSTM: Instrument examination
          5.5.1.1.3. MSN: As specified in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
          5.5.1.1.4. (Added-AFMC) An EPE is a requisite for INSTR Evaluations (Initial or
          RQ)
       5.5.1.2. Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPEs).
          5.5.1.2.1. Purpose. Evaluate an aircrew member’s knowledge of MDS-Specific EPs
          and systems for all QUAL evaluations; evaluate mission-specific EPs and tactical
          systems knowledge during MSN evaluations.
          5.5.1.2.2. Execution. AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 will specify contents of EPEs, areas to be
          evaluated, grading criteria, and whether EPEs may be done in-flight, in a
          simulator/ATD, or verbally.
          5.5.1.2.2. (AFMC) Units will develop profiles for emergency procedure evaluations
          using the AFMC worksheets as a foundation. These profiles will contain elements of
          the unit’s mission if applicable (i.e., FCF profiles). Flight examiners will tailor
          evaluation profiles using as a minimum the listed requirements on the worksheets.
          Units will use the appropriate overlay of the AFMC Form 59, Aircrew Evaluation
          Sheet (found on the AFMC/A3V website) or the AFMC Form 72, SEFE Objectivity
          Evaluation Sheet to conduct evaluations and to meet the required evaluation profiles.
              5.5.1.2.2.1. Only one EPE needs to be accomplished for each combined
              evaluation (i.e., one EPE for a QUAL/MSN or INSTM/QUAL/MSN evaluation).
              5.5.1.2.2.2. A single EPE may be used for separate evaluations (e.g. a MSN and
              INSTM/QUAL eval) as long as the combined EPE is of a scope and duration to
              cover required areas and is conducted within the requisite zone for each
              evaluation (see paragraph 5.8).
38                                                   AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011


           5.5.1.2.3. Grading. Q1 performance for EPEs requires taking the proper action in
           the correct sequence, not a verbatim response. Each aircrew member is responsible
           for the Boldface/CAPs applicable to their crew position.
           5.5.1.2.4. Additional Training. For an EPE requiring additional training, the flight
           examiner will indicate if the additional training must be accomplished before the next
           unsupervised flight (see also paragraph 5.3.2.2.2). Document IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.6
           and 7.3.7.3.4.
           5.5.1.2.5. Boldface/CAPs Failure. An incorrect response to a Boldface/CAP
           situation during an EPE requires an EPE grade of 3 (unqualified). Under these
           circumstances, the examinee will not fly again until a successful reevaluation is
           accomplished (either written, verbally, or in a simulator/ATD as determined by the
           flight examiner)
           5.5.1.2.6. Unqualified EPE. An examinee receiving an EPE grade of 3
           (unqualified) will be placed on supervised status IAW paragraph 5.7.
  5.5.2. Flight Phase Requisites. The flight phase for aircrew evaluations include execution
  in the weapon system and/or a suitable simulator/ATD (unless restricted by AFI 11-2MDS
  Vol 2).
        5.5.2.1. The profile used to fulfill the flight phase requisite must incorporate all
        appropriate requirements set in the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2, and allow accurate
        measure of the proficiency of the examinee.
        5.5.2.2. Evaluation profiles will be realistic, reflect unit tasking, be consistent with daily
        training missions, and incorporate current tactics applicable to the unit mission.
     5.5.3. Requisite Completion.
        5.5.3.1. In-the-Eligibility Period. For scheduled or no-notice periodic evaluations in
        the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within the eligibility period of the
        current evaluation (see paragraph 5.8). The OG/CC may waive this requirement on a
        case-by-case basis (document on the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
        5.5.3.2. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. For periodic evaluations accomplished outside
        the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within a six-month period
        beginning with the month in which the first ground requisite or flight evaluation was
        administered, whichever occurs first. EXCEPTION: For extended evaluations (IAW
        paragraph 5.8.3.2), requisites may be completed between the beginning of the six-month
        eligibility period prior to the original expiration date and the extended expiration date.
        5.5.3.2. (AFMC) For initial qualification evaluations, requals, and initial instructor
        evaluations all requisites must be completed prior to the flight evaluation. Requisites for
        initial qualification, requalification, and initial instructor evaluations may be completed
        up to 5 months prior to the month of the evaluation. If the aircrew member has not
        completed IRC within the previous four quarters, the course must be completed prior to
        the flight portion of the AF Form 8 evaluation. Pilots qualifying in aircraft that require
        only one pilot must complete written qualification examinations before the first training
        flight without an IP in the aircraft. Complete all required requisites for both crew
        positions when completing combined evaluations.
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011                                                              39


          5.5.3.2.1. (Added-AFMC) Use these criteria for SPOT and No-Notice evaluations
          that will fulfill or reset the periodic eligibility requirements.
       5.5.3.3. One set of requisites may be used to satisfy the requirements of combined
       evaluations as defined in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
       5.5.3.4. Requisites from a completed evaluation may be used for subsequent evaluations
       provided they cover all required areas and are within the requisite zone for each
       evaluation.
       5.5.3.5. For aircrew possessing instrument qualifications in multiple aircraft, one
       instrument exam may count for separate evaluations provided the instrument exam occurs
       within the zone for each evaluation IAW the paragraphs above.
5.6. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation.
   5.6.1. Recheck. If an aircrew member fails a flight evaluation, a successful flight or ground
   recheck must be completed by the end of the third month after the date of the first failure,
   (e.g. for an evaluation on 20 Jun 12, complete the recheck by 30 Sep 12).
       5.6.1.1. OG/CCs may approve waivers to the three-month time limit on a case-by-case
       basis.
          5.6.1.1.1. Document the waiver(s) with an MFR to be included in the AF Form 8/8a
          IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
       5.6.1.2. Commanders will determine the number of flights to be allowed during this
       period, based on the individual’s experience level, present qualifications and hours of
       training required.
       5.6.1.3. The flight examiner that administered the original check will not normally
       administer the recheck.
       5.6.1.4. A recheck is successfully completed when the aircrew member performs to Q or
       Q-/debriefed criteria for each area graded U.
       5.6.1.5. Ground rechecks may be directed when the flight examiner deems a flight
       recheck unnecessary, but are accomplished subsequent to the debriefing of a Q3
       evaluation (document IAW paragraph 7.3.9.2).
       5.6.1.6. Requisites that were valid for a failed evaluation per paragraph 5.5.3.1 or 5.5.3.2
       remain valid, IAW the paragraphs above.
   5.6.2. Status Downgrade. Aircrew members receiving a Q3 INSTM, QUAL and/or MSN
   evaluation are non-mission ready (NMR)/non-combat mission ready (N-CMR)/non-basic
   mission capable(N-BMC)/non-basic aircraft qualified (N-BAQ) IAW AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1.
   For instructor evaluations, aircrew status (i.e., MR/CMR or BMC) need not be downgraded if
   the discrepancies were only in instructor areas/subareas.
   5.6.3. Restrictions. When called for by this instruction or deemed necessary in the
   judgment of the flight examiner, flight restrictions will be imposed on the examinee until
   successful completion of assigned additional training and/or a recheck.
       5.6.3.1. Restrictions should address the specific phase of flight and/or operation that
       requires supervision and the criteria for removal of the restrictions.
 40                                              AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011


          5.6.3.1.1. QUAL Evaluation: Place the examinee on supervised status (see
          paragraph 5.7) in the aircraft in which the evaluation was administered, unless, in the
          opinion of the evaluator, the discrepancy is applicable to additional aircraft. For
          specialized, universal, and/or multiple qualified aircrew maintaining qualification for
          similar duty in multiple aircraft, AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 may direct supervised status in
          all aircraft in which the individual maintains qualification.
          5.6.3.1.2. INSTM Evaluation: Restrictions apply to all aircraft in which the
          examinee is required to maintain instrument qualification.
          5.6.3.1.3. MSN       Evaluation:     The      examinee      may      perform    basic
          qualification/instrument tasks unless specifically restricted. Place the examinee on
          supervised status for mission tasks.
          5.6.3.1.4. INSTR Evaluation (or any evaluation where instructor qualifications are
          being evaluated): Instructors receiving an unsatisfactory grade in any instructor
          area(s) will not perform instructor duties until a successful recheck is completed.
      5.6.3.2. Restrict aircrew receiving a Q3 on any evaluation until a successful recheck is
      completed (see paragraph 5.6.1).
      5.6.3.3. If defined in AFI11-2MDS Vol 1 and/or Vol 2, formal schoolhouses will include
      restrictions on the AF Form 8/8a for any core item not accomplished due to training
      limitations, regardless if the method of qualification is by evaluation or instructor
      certification. Under no circumstance will aircrew perform core items in which they are
      not qualified unless under the direct supervision of an instructor. In this case, MDS-
      specific guidance will set the time requirement for completion of additional training.
      5.6.3.3. (AFMC) See AFI 11-2FT Vol 1 for guidance on removal of formal school
      evaluation restrictions.
      5.6.3.4. Document restrictions on the AF Form 8/8a IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.7 and 7.3.7.1.
5.7. Supervised Status.
   5.7.1. If unsatisfactory performance or restrictions require an examinee be placed on
   supervised status, the type of supervisor (i.e., instructor or designated supervisor) will be
   determined by the SQ/CC and/or as specified in AFI11-2MDS Vol 1.
   5.7.2. Supervision will only be accomplished by instructors or designated supervisors.
5.8. Timing of Aircrew Qualification Evaluations.
   5.8.1. Expiration Date. Required periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the 17th
   month following the month in which the flight phase was successfully flown (e.g. a periodic
   evaluation in which the flight phase was completed on 9 Oct 10 expires on 31 Mar 12.).
   5.8.2. Eligibility Period. Periodic evaluations will be scheduled in the eligibility period,
   defined as the six-month period prior to the expiration date.
   5.8.3. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. On a case-by-case basis, periodic evaluations may be
   scheduled before or after the eligibility period according to the following criteria:
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011                                                               41


     5.8.3.1. Evaluations Conducted Prior to the Eligibility Period. SQ/CCs may
     authorize individuals to complete periodic evaluations prior to the eligibility period
     (document IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
     5.8.3.2. Extended Evaluations.
         5.8.3.2.1. HHQ-Extended Evaluations. HQ USAF/A3O-A may authorize blanket
         or group extensions on an as-required basis. Requests for extensions at MAJCOM or
         subordinate levels will be submitted IAW paragraph 1.3.2.
         5.8.3.2.2. MAJCOM-Extended           Evaluations. MAJCOM/A3s       may     extend
         evaluation expiration dates for individual aircrew members on a case-by-case basis
         IAW paragraph 1.3.1. Provide guidance for MAJCOM extensions in MAJCOM
         supplements to this instruction.
         5.8.3.2.2. (AFMC) Submit case-by-case requests for an evaluation extension to
         AFMC/A3V using the AFMC Form 73. Extensions beyond three months will not
         normally be considered.
         5.8.3.2.3. SQ/CC-Extended Evaluations. SQ/CCs may extend the expiration date
         of periodic evaluations up to three months for the reasons listed below (document
         IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2). Extensions will be on a case-by-case basis and this
         paragraph is not authority to grant blanket extensions. For individual extensions
         longer than three months, see paragraph 5.8.3.2.2. For group or blanket extensions,
         see paragraph 5.8.3.2.1. Requisites not completed during the original eligibility
         period must be completed prior to the extended expiration date.
             5.8.3.2.3.1. PCS/PCA to a non-flying assignment.
             5.8.3.2.3.2. Departing PCS or TDY for retraining in another aircraft type.
             5.8.3.2.3.3. Undergoing unit aircraft conversion, as directed by MAJCOM.
             5.8.3.2.3.4. Removal from active flying status (e.g. separation or retirement).
             5.8.3.2.3.5. Participation in real world operations (to include operations other
             than war, alert, etc.) who are not able to complete the required flight evaluation(s)
             before or during deployment.
     5.8.3.3. Non-Standard Approval Authority
         5.8.3.3.1. For SQ/CCs and above (e.g. OG/CCs, WG/CCs, etc.), the approval
         authority is the next commander in the examinee’s flying chain of command.
         5.8.3.3.2. In all other cases, if the flying chain of command differs from
         administrative chain of command (e.g. HHQ attached flyers), approvals will be by the
         attached unit/CC with the concurrence of the examinee’s immediate administrative
         supervisor.
         5.8.3.3.3. For individuals not assigned to a MAJCOM, AF/A3O-A is the approval
         authority.
  5.8.4. Failure to Complete an Evaluation within the Required Period. If an aircrew
  member fails to complete an evaluation (either ground phase or flight phase) within the
  eligibility period for an in-the-eligibility period evaluation (see paragraph 5.8.2) or within the
 42                                               AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011


   period for an out-of-the-eligibility period evaluation (see paragraph 5.8.3), the aircrew
   member loses the qualification covered by the evaluation and the restrictions of paragraph
   5.6.3 apply.
       5.8.4.1. Qualification may be re-established by accomplishing a complete requalification
       evaluation (to include requisites) or by completion of the delinquent evaluation.
       5.8.4.2. OG/CCs may waive the re-accomplishment of completed requisites on a case-
       by-case basis (document IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
5.9. Commander-Directed Downgrade. Any commander (squadron or above) may direct a
downgrade (Q-/U) in a specific area/sub-area without unqualifying an individual. Additionally, a
commander may direct a downgrade that either removes a qualification (e.g. IP to MP) or
completely unqualifies an individual (e.g. MP to UP). Downgrades may be directed without
administering an evaluation using the following guidance:
   5.9.1. For flying-related cases, use for cause only (e.g., breach of flying discipline, flight
   safety, etc.). Incidents do not have to be directly observed by an examiner, but may be
   recommended by an examiner from any MDS/aircrew specialty.
   5.9.2. For non-flying-related cases, do not use as a substitution for, or in lieu of,
   administrative or judicial actions (e.g. Letter of Counseling, Article 15, etc.). (Consult with
   the supporting SJA office for legal advice in these cases.) Use in cases where such incidences
   directly affect the commander’s confidence in the aircrew member’s ability to safely operate
   the aircraft and/or equipment (e.g. lapse in judgment significant enough to cast doubt on the
   aircrew’s decision-making abilities in the aircraft).
   5.9.3. For downgrades that either remove qualifications or completely unqualify an
   individual, the affected aircrew will cease acting in the qualification(s) from which they have
   been downgraded effective with the date the commander initiated the downgrade.
   5.9.4. Commander Directed Downgrades will be documented IAW paragraph 7.4.
5.10. Multiple Qualification. Multiple qualification guidance applies to aircrew members who
maintain qualification in two or more MDS aircraft. For Universal Qualification see paragraph
5.11.
5.10. (AFMC)Certification in MD variants (series or modified mission) does not constitute
multiple qualifications (i. e. F-15C and F-15E or C-130H and AC-130H).
   5.10.1. When differences between aircraft in the same MDS are great enough, the lead
   MAJCOM, in coordination with using MAJCOMs, will identify requirements for separate
   qualification requirements.
   5.10.2. When separate qualifications are not required, document certification in different
   MDS series using AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications. In lieu of the AF Form
   4348, MAJCOMs may approve use of a unit certification document signed by an authorized
   official.
   5.10.2. (AFMC) Use the AF Form 4348 to document completion of conversion/difference
   training in these aircraft when a Form 8 evaluation is not required. In addition, units will
   document all aircraft in which training has been completed on the Letter of X.
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011                                                            43


  5.10.3. Documentation. Document MAJCOM authority for multiple qualification,
  including a list of aircraft in which qualification will be maintained IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
  See AFI 11-202, Vol 1.
  5.10.3. (AFMC) Document AFMC multiple qualifications on AFMC Form 80, Multiple
  Qualification Request and Authorization. Use the AFMC Form 80 to document military,
  government civilian, and contractor aircrew members that fly in support of AFMC flight
  operations. Use AFMC Form 80 for all pilot, RPA pilot, navigator, CSO, electronic warfare
  officer, fire control officer, flight engineer, loadmaster, and boom operator multiple
  qualification requests. Flight surgeons flying under an FS duty code do not require an AFMC
  Form 80. Any Flight Surgeon acting as a primary crew member (i.e. pilot, navigator, etc) will
  have an AFMC Form 80, coordinated and approved as detailed above. A Form 80 is not
  required for Non-rated aircrew multiple qualification documentation. AFMC Form 80 will
  be maintained in the first section of the Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF).
     5.10.3.1. (Added-AFMC) Approval Authority. AFMC delegates approval authority for
     dual qualifications to the flying wing commander. Alternatively, AFMC/A3V is the
     approval authority for dual qualifications for aircrew who are assigned to an AFMC unit
     without a parent flying wing organization. AFMC/A3 is the approval authority for
     Center, wing and group commanders. AFMC/A3 is the approval authority for any other
     O-6 in a flying position. Submit the AFMC Form 80 for these individuals to AFMC/A3V
     for coordination and staffing to AFMC/A3. AFMC/A3 is the approval authority for all
     triple qualifications. Triple qualifications will only be authorized when there is a
     complete and compelling reason. The duration of the qualification will be a temporary
     solution to solve short term manning problems. The unit must submit justification in
     writing signed by the wing commander or equivalent. Submit the AFMC Form 80 and
     accompanying justification to AFMC/A3V for coordination and staffing to AFMC/A3.
     Forward copies of all AFMC Forms 80 to AFMC/A3V for command level program
     oversight.
     5.10.3.2. (AFMC) Review and Reporting. Each year in September, OG/CCs will
     review and re-validate all multiple qualifications. Cancel those no longer required for
     mission accomplishment. Document this review with initials and date on each AFMC
     Form 80. A new AFMC Form 80 is required when aircraft qualification is changed.
     Changes in aircrew duty position do not require annotation. Upon permanent change of
     station (PCS) of a multiple qualified aircrew, the AFMC Form 80 will be re-
     accomplished by the gaining unit if multiple qualifications are still required. AFMC
     Forms 80 approved at HQ AFMC will have a control number and expiration date. These
     blocks are optional for flying wing commander approved multiple qualifications. Submit
     a complete listing of all multiple qualifications to AFMC/A3V via COOL at the end of
     each FY (30 Sep) for compilation into the AFMC/A3V review.
     5.10.3.3. (Added-AFMC) Exceptions. Pilot and flight engineer qualification in B-
     707/E-3/E-8 variants are considered a single qualification upon completion of conversion
     training in each specified aircraft. Pilot qualification in B-747 variants (including AL-1)
     is considered a single qualification upon completion of conversion training in each
     specified aircraft. RPA pilot qualification in the MQ-1 and MQ-9 is considered a single
     qualification upon completion of conversion training in each aircraft. RPA (UAS Group
     4/5) companion trainers (if applicable) will be documented on an AFMC Forms 80;
 44                                              AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011


       however, the companion trainer is not considered a “second” or “third” qualification in
       regards to approval authority. Non-USAF glider tow planes, and civil aviation (aero club)
       aircraft flown in conjunction with the United States Air Force Test Pilot School
       (USAFTPS) curriculum do not constitute a multiple qualification. Aircraft flown for non-
       DoD purposes (i.e. DoD contractor aircrew flying on non-DoD contract aircraft) do not
       constitute a multiple qualification. This exception does not constitute a multiple
       qualification; however, document all aircraft flown for professional reasons on an AFMC
       Form 80 (See DCMA Inst 8210.1 / AFI 10-220 for additional guidance). Qualifications in
       multiple variants of the same MD family do not constitute a multiple qualification. See
       AFI 11-2FT Vol 1, MDS Attachments for additional guidance.
       5.10.3.4. (Added-AFMC) Training. Do not begin qualification ground or flying
       training in an additional aircraft until the AFMC Form 80 has been approved. AFMC
       Form 80 approval does not negate or relieve any provisions of AFI 11-202V1 concerning
       aircraft qualification training. Do not enter flying personnel into qualification or re-
       qualification training in more than one aircraft at the same time.
       5.10.3.5. (Added-AFMC) OG/CCs will designate a primary aircraft for multiple
       qualified aircrews. AF Forms 8 for dual qualified pilots will be reviewed as directed in
       Table 5.1 (Added). The Final Approval Official will be the flying unit commander for
       the aircraft in which the eval was administered.

   5.10.4. Instrument Evaluation. Pilots need only complete an INSTM evaluation, to
   include requisites, in one of the aircraft in which they maintain qualification as specified by
   the authorizing MAJCOM unless additional INSTM evaluation requirements are directed by
   the MAJCOM in its supplement to this instruction.
   5.10.4. (AFMC) Dual qualified pilots will complete an instrument evaluation in each
   category of aircraft in which qualified. See Table 5.1 (Added) Contact AFMC/A3V for any
   aircraft not listed.
   5.10.5. QUAL and MSN Evaluations. All aircrew require a QUAL evaluation, and, if
   applicable, a MSN evaluation, to include requisites, in each MDS aircraft they maintain
   qualification according to applicable AFI MDS Vol 2, or AFI 16-1202 Vol 2.
   5.10.5. (AFMC) Different series aircraft in the same MD do not constitute multiple
   qualifications and therefore do not require separate QUAL evaluations.
   5.10.6. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation. A Q3 on an INSTM evaluation results in a
   downgrade in all aircraft flown in which instrument qualification is required. A downgrade
   resulting from a Q3 in a QUAL or MSN evaluation applies only to the aircraft for which the
   evaluation was administered, unless, in the opinion of the evaluator, the discrepancy is
   applicable to additional aircraft.
5.11. Universal Qualification. Universal qualification guidance applies to specialized aircrew
who maintain qualification in two or more MDS where qualification is attained/maintained via a
minimum of a ground phase examination. A flight phase evaluation, when required, may be
accomplished on any of the aircraft in which the aircrew member is either gaining or maintaining
qualification.
   5.11.1. Applicability. Specialized aircrew may gain/maintain aircraft qualifications IAW
   Universal Qualification guidance. MAJCOMs will identify Universal Qualified crewmember
   eligibility in the MAJCOM supplement to this AFI.
   5.11.1. (AFMC) Universal Qualification status is not applicable to AFMC operations.
   5.11.2. Documentation. See Chapter 7 or Chapter 8, as applicable.
   5.11.3. Qualification and Mission Evaluations. All aircrew qualifications maintained
   under Universal Qualification guidance are considered a QUAL evaluation. A MSN
   evaluation may be directed by applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 and/or MAJCOM supplement
   to this Instruction. MSN evaluations, when required, will include a flight phase evaluation in
   one MDS that the Specialized Aircrew member maintains qualification.
   5.11.4. Failure to Pass a Requisite/Flight Evaluation. Failure of universally qualified
   aircrew members to pass a ground requisite or flight phase evaluation results in loss of
   applicable aircraft qualification, IAW MAJCOM supplement and AFI MDS Vol 2.
5.12. Aircrew Flying in Non-USAF Aircraft and with Non-USAF Units. Aircrew members
authorized to perform duties in non-USAF aircraft IAW AFI 11-401, or on duty with or attached
to non-USAF units for flying, abide by host service or host country guidance, except for the
requirement to maintain a current physical and review their flight records according to AFI 11-
202, Vol 1 and AFI 11-401.

   5.12.1. Aircrew flying with non-USAF units (i.e. Exchange) do not need to abide by USAF
   guidance, including this AFI and AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2. Therefore, when they return to USAF
   units, they must complete applicable requisites and be evaluated for any periodic USAF
   evaluations that expired during their tour. The restrictions in paragraph 5.6.3 of this
   instruction apply to such individuals until successful evaluations are completed.
   5.12.2. MAJCOM/A3s may approve exceptions to requirements for returning Exchange
   aircrew members to complete applicable requisites and expired USAF evaluations, if they
   determine non-USAF evaluations are equivalent to applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2
   evaluations (document IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
   5.12.2. (AFMC) Submit request to AFMC/A3V for considerations and/or approval.
   5.12.3. USAF units that use non-USAF aircraft to execute a USAF flying program will
   comply with current USAF guidance, unless when excepted by proper authority. See AFI 11-
   401 for definitions of USAF and US Government aircraft.
   5.12.4. (Added-AFMC) Exchange/Foreign Personnel. All primary aircrew will have a
   current AF Form 8 to fly in an unsupervised status. Commanders will approve and Chiefs of
   Stan/Eval will review each aircrew’s individualized training program to ensure adequate
   knowledge of and proficiency in USAF/AFMC procedures. Upon completion of training,
   conduct ground and flight evaluations (as required) and document on AF Forms 8 (Not
   applicable for USAF/TPS students).
5.13. Initial Cadre.
   5.13.1. Aircrew members who are appointed by their MAJCOMs as initial cadre either for a
   new mission set requiring a MSN qualification or for a new MDS where no flight examiner
   currently exists will comply with the intent of this instruction.
   5.13.1. (AFMC) Initial Cadre status may be extended to any aircrew (rated, CEA, or non-
   rated). OG/CC will designate initial cadre crewmembers.
   5.13.2. See paragraph 7.5 for guidance on Form 8/8a documentation.
   5.13.3. MAJCOMs will indicate through MFR which aircrew are appointed as initial cadre
   and include in the FEF IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
   5.13.3. (AFMC) The MFR will document training requirements (if any) associated with
   initial cadre status.
   5.13.4. Tailor recurring evaluations to program requirements and aircraft capabilities.
   Simulators may be used to satisfy recurring evaluation requirements.
   5.13.5. Pilots in these programs will maintain an instrument qualification (see paragraph
   5.2.2). Maintenance of the instrument qualification, if not practical due to the developing
   capabilities of the new mission set and/or MDS, will be accomplished in aircraft possessing
   similar flying qualities/instrumentation as stipulated in the MAJCOM supplement/AFI 11-
   MDS Vol 2/MOU.

                         AIRCREW EXAMINATION PROGRAM

6.1. Purpose. The aircrew examination program measures aircrew member knowledge of
normal/emergency procedures, threats, and other information essential for the safe and effective
operation of their assigned weapon system through the administration of written or computer-
based examinations.
6.2. Scope. This chapter applies to rated (pilots, Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) pilots,
navigators, combat systems operators, and air battle managers), CEA, non-rated X-prefix AE
aircrew and RPA sensor operators. For Flight Surgeons (rated), Combat Camera, and non-rated
aircrew (K-, Q-, or other X-prefix Air Force Specialty Code) that only require an examination to
establish qualification, see Chapter 8. The examination program in this chapter includes
requisite examinations for periodic evaluations and unit periodic examinations. Requisite
examinations include qualification open book and closed book examinations, instrument
examinations and Boldface/CAPs examinations as described in paragraph 5.5.1.1.
6.2. (AFMC)Scope This chapter also applies to non-rated (X-prefix), AFMC
assigned/attached Flight Surgeons, and all government civilians and contractors in like
aircrew positions.
6.3. Administrative Procedures.
   6.3.1. Program Documentation. Units will document the unit-level aircrew examination
   program.
   6.3.2. Computer-Based Examinations. MAJCOM directed Stan/Eval software may fulfill
   the requirement for exams as outlined in this instruction.
   6.3.2. (AFMC) AFMC will use Center Operations On Line (COOL) as designated by
   AFMC/A3V.
   6.3.3. Retention of Examination Records. Retain graded exam answer sheets/computer
   records until the AF Form 8/8a is completed.
6.4. Exam Sources.
   6.4.1. Open Book Exams. Open book questions will come from publications containing
   information pertinent to the operation of applicable aircraft and performance of the assigned
   mission.
       6.4.1.1. The open book subject areas and the publications used to generate the exam will
       be made available to aircrew during testing. Electronic publications may be used as
       references for open book examinations.
       6.4.1.2. Each unit will develop an open book Secure Question Bank (SQB) that serves as
       the source for the open book exam. Do not distribute the SQB to unit aircrews and
       safeguard it in the same manner as any other required Stan/Eval exam.
       6.4.1.3. (Added-AFMC) Open book examinations will contain a minimum of 50
       questions, 10 of which will be derived from applicable USAF, AFMC, and local flight
       instructions. Examinations will be reviewed for accuracy upon change or revision to any
48                                            AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011


     referenced publication. Use of AFMC Form 70, Standardization/Evaluation Answer
     Sheet or equivalent can be used for any testing requirement.
     6.4.1.4. (Added-AFMC) Open book examinations are not required for non-rated (X-
     prefix) aircrew or Flight Surgeons, but may be prescribed at the unit level. Units will
     forward copies to AFMC/A3V for review.
 6.4.2. Closed Book Exams. Questions will come from MQFs.
 6.4.2. (AFMC) Closed book examinations will be constructed from master question files
 and will measure knowledge of essential information critical to the safe and effective
 operation of the aircraft to include aircraft limitations, systems, normal and emergency
 procedures, cautions, warnings, and egress. Examinations will contain a minimum of 20
 questions and, when applicable, boldface/CAPS. Examinations will be reviewed for accuracy
 upon change or revision of any referenced publication.
     6.4.2.1. MDS/crew position-specific MQFs. Lead MAJCOMs will ensure MDS/crew-
     specific MQFs are available for using MAJCOM use and distribution to applicable
     aircrew.
     6.4.2.1. (AFMC) Test questions should be multiple choice with only four possible
     answers (a,b,c,d). True/false questions may also be used. The MQFs will contain a
     minimum of 100 questions taken from the flight manual. Non-rated aircrew (to include
     FS) MQFs will contain a minimum of 50 questions. These questions must be applicable
     to all users of the MDS. If unable to generate 50 questions, contact AFMC/A3V relief.
     An AFMC Form 73 waiver is not required for approval.
        6.4.2.1.1. Units may edit MQFs to accommodate local testing procedures,
        administrative errors and reflect recent changes to systems and/or operational
        procedures; however, subject matter may not be changed.
        6.4.2.1.2. Units will forward edits of MQF questions to the appropriate MAJCOM.
        Lead MAJCOMs will review MQFs annually and distribute changes to MQFs as
        necessary.
        6.4.2.1.3. (Added-AFMC) Similar Model/Design aircraft may have combined
        MQFs and tests to cover all series in that design. (i.e.F-16/A/C/CM). Crew members
        are responsible for only those questions that are specific to MDS variants for which
        they are qualified. These questions will be identified by category designation.
        6.4.2.1.4. (AFMC) The key element of the MQF program is the CCP. CCPs will
        develop and maintain their respective MQFs tailoring each mission design series
        (MDS) and crew position to AFI 11-2FTV2. The MQF program will be posted on the
        Edwards COOL server. In addition, each CCP will be responsible for updating their
        MQFs when changes to the Flight Manual occur.
            6.4.2.1.4.1. (AFMC) CCPs will be tasked to update MQFs annually or when a
            change to the flight manual occurs. Updated/reviewed MQFs will be annotated
            with the current month and year in the title. The MQFs will be reviewed annually
            no later than 1 March. If an out of cycle MQF is released, AFMC/A3V will notify
            each OGV in order to inform subordinate units.
            6.4.2.1.4.2. (Added-AFMC) Notify AFMC/A3V and the CCP upon the
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011                                                            49


              discovery of inaccurate or outdated information in command MQF files.
       6.4.2.2. Local Procedures MQF. Units may develop and distribute a local procedures
       MQF to augment MDS/crew position-specific MQFs.
   6.4.3. Instrument Exams. Reference AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher Program.
   Units will ensure that only those questions relevant to the weapons system(s) and instrument
   procedures within their unit are included in the available questions from which aircrew will
   test.
   6.4.4. Exam Question Review. The MAJCOM, NAF, and OG Stan/Eval functions will
   review all MDS/crew position-specific MQFs, SQBs, and prepared exams (if used) annually
   and after any changes in source documents. If a complete review was accomplished due to a
   source document change it may be annotated as the annual review. Units will document
   procedures for the exam reviews in their supplement to this instruction.
6.5. End-of-Course Exams. FTUs administering USAF Formal School courses listed in the Air
Force      Education     and    Training    Course     Announcement        (ETCA)    database
(https://etca.randolph.af.mil/) may use end-of-course (EOC) exams to fulfill the requirements
of the open book, closed book and Boldface/CAPS (if applicable) requisite exams.
   6.5.1. The Stan/Eval agencies of the MAJCOM responsible for training will coordinate with
   the MDS lead MAJCOM to ensure the EOC exam meets the requirements of this instruction
   and AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 before awarding credit for requisite completion.
   6.5.2. EOC exam questions do not need to incorporate MDS/crew position-specific MQFs.
   All questions must reflect the latest changes to all systems and/or operational procedures and
   not conflict with any MQFs.
   6.5.3. All EOC exams that fulfill the requirements of requisite exams will be graded
   according to paragraph 6.8 and entered on the AF Form 8/8a according to paragraph 7.3.5.1.
6.6. Exam Management. With the exception of written Boldface/CAPs exams, units will either
maintain prepared exams for each crew position or generate a unique exam for each aircrew
member.
   6.6.1. If prepared exams are maintained for each crew position:
       6.6.1.1. Units are required to develop and control a minimum of two exams for each
       crew position.
       6.6.1.2. Units having ten or fewer members per crew position require only one exam.
       6.6.1.3. When different crew positions are responsible for the same information, units are
       not required to maintain separate exams for each crew position.
       6.6.1.4. Change a minimum of 50 percent of the questions on each prepared exam each
       calendar year.
   6.6.2. If a unique exam is generated for each aircrew member:
       6.6.2.1. Units may use MAJCOM-approved software for exam creation.
 50                                                 AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011


         6.6.2.2. Requisite exam databases will contain at least twice the number of questions
         required for each exam (e.g. if a 50-question exam is generated, there must be at least 100
         questions in the exam database).
   6.6.3. When published guidance changes, the associated prepared exam or exam database
   (depending on method used) will be updated as soon as possible upon receipt.
6.7. Exam Security. Stan/Eval personnel will maintain positive control of all requisite exams,
applicable answer sheets, and associated computer-based media.
6.8. Grading.
   6.8.1. Boldface/CAPs. Grade Boldface/CAPs exams on the two-tier grading system (i.e.
   Q/U). Satisfactory performance requires writing the proper actions in the correct sequence,
   not necessarily a verbatim response. The minimum passing grade is 100 percent.
   6.8.2. Written or Computer-Based Examinations. Grade written or computer based
   examinations as a percentage of correct answers. The minimum passing grade is 85 percent.
   All questions missed will be reviewed immediately following the exam.
   6.8.3. Units will grade all requisite and/or Boldface/CAPs exams prior to the aircrew
   member’s next flight.
6.9. Failure to Pass a Requisite Exam.
   6.9.1. Reexamination Policy. An aircrew member failing a requisite examination must be
   afforded an adequate study period prior to reexamination. For other than Boldface/CAPs, the
   aircrew member will be reevaluated using an alternate exam.
   6.9.2. Reexamination Period. Aircrew members who fail a requisite exam must complete a
   successful reexam by the end of the third month following the date of the first failure, or the
   end of their eligibility period, whichever occurs first. Waiver authority to extend the time
   allowed to successfully complete the reexam is the OG/CC (document IAW paragraph
   7.8.3.2.2).
   6.9.3. Boldface/CAPs Reexamination Restriction. Aircrew members failing a
   Boldface/CAPs exam will not fly as aircrew members until a successful Boldface/CAPs
   reexam is accomplished.
      6.9.4. Supervised Status.
         6.9.4.1. Place aircrew members who fail a requisite open/closed book or instrument
         exam in supervised status IAW paragraph 5.7 until successful retesting is completed.
         6.9.4.2. For aircrew members who maintain multiple qualifications, supervised status
         resulting from failure of either an open or closed book examination applies only to the
         aircraft for which the examination was administered. Failure of the instrument exam
         results in the examinee being placed in supervised status in all aircraft in which
         instrument qualification is required.
6.10. Unit Periodic Examinations (Optional). If used, MAJCOMs and/or units will include
guidance in their supplements to include procedures for failed exams.
6.10. (AFMC)Unit Periodic Examinations (Optional). Periodic testing content and frequency
is at the discretion of the unit, if used.
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011                                                         51


  6.10.1. Each group/squadron Stan/Eval function may conduct periodic testing for all aircrew.
  The intent of this testing is to evaluate additional knowledge beyond the scope of requisite
  exams, such as a cross-section of general knowledge, tactical/threat knowledge, and/or
  operational procedures, etc., to determine if knowledge deficiencies exist within the unit.
  6.10.2. Administration of the exam is at the discretion of the MAJCOM and/or unit.
  6.10.3. Periodic exams will not count as a requisite exam, nor will a requisite exam satisfy
  the requirement for a periodic exam.
 52                                                AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011


                                           Chapter 7

                                     DOCUMENTATION

7.1. Scope. Administration of the aircrew qualification evaluation program requires accurate
documentation. The qualifications for which an aircrew member is to be evaluated are
determined from the unit certification document. This chapter provides documentation guidance
for members that require an in-flight evaluation to establish qualification. See Chapter 8 for
documentation guidance pertaining to flight surgeons, combat camera, and non-rated aircrew that
only require an examination to establish qualification.
   7.1.1. The results of aircrew evaluations are recorded on the AF Form 8/8a. The
   chronological history of evaluations for an aircrew member is recorded on an AF Form 942,
   Record of Evaluation. These AF forms are maintained in the FEF.
   7.1.2. In all instances of documentation, use of electronic forms is authorized, to include use
   of electronic signatures and wholly electronic FEFs IAW MAJCOM supplement guidance. In
   all instances, computer-generated forms must mirror AF forms as published on the USAF E-
   Publishing web site.
   7.1.2. (AFMC) Electronic Forms 8/8a and all other contents of an electronic FEF will be
   maintained in COOL.
7.2. Qualifications versus Certifications. Qualifications are attained through evaluations and
documented on the AF Form 8/8a, as applicable. Certifications are attained through methods
other than evaluation (e.g. commander certifications, flight lead upgrades, etc.) and may be
documented on an AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications or on a unit certification
document signed by an authorized official.
7.2. (AFMC)AFMC units and AFRC units under OPCON to AFMC will use the AF Form
4348 to document completion of conversion/difference training when a Form 8 evaluation is
not required. The Form 4348 is not required for qualifications documented on the Form 8a.
The Form 4348 is not required if only one variant of an MD exists (ie B-2A).
7.3. AF Form 8/8a, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.
   7.3.1. Purpose. The AF Form 8/8a is the source document used to record and verify the
   qualification of an aircrew member.
       7.3.1.1. Use the AF Form 8 to record aircrew qualification in a single aircraft.
       7.3.1.2. Use of the AF Form 8a is optional for aircrew maintaining qualification in
       multiple aircraft and/or multiple series qualification in the same MDS or are Universal
       Qualified.
       7.3.1.2. (AFMC) The AF Form 8a will be used to document non-rated (X-prefix)
       aircrew and Flight Surgeon aircraft qualification. The Form 8a will not be used to
       document primary aircrew (rated and CEA) qualification in multiple aircraft.
       7.3.1.3. Completion of an AF Form 8/8a is accomplished by four individuals: the flight
       examiner, a Reviewing Officer, a Final Approving Officer, and the examinee.
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011                                                              53


  7.3.2. General Data Entry. See Attachment 3 for sample AF Forms 8, Attachment 4 for
  sample AF Forms 8a.
     7.3.2.1. In all instances of data entry, if an electronic form is used, the format required by
     the electronic form will be used (see also paragraph 7.1.2).
     7.3.2.2. For date fields use a two-digit day, three-letter month and two-digit year format
     (e.g. 24 Jun 12).
     7.3.2.3. The “Eligibility Period” and “Expiration Date of Qualification” blocks will use a
     three-letter month and two-digit year format (Jun 12).
     7.3.2.4. Except where specifically noted otherwise (i.e. annotating the type evaluation,
     “INSTR”), use upper and lower case letters.
     7.3.2.5. Requirements for font, indentation, and justification (right, left or centered) of
     data are not specified. MAJCOM supplements may direct specific format standards as
     desired.
  7.3.3. Date Completed.
     7.3.3.1. Use the latest completion date of the evaluation requisites (ground or flight
     phase) or the additional training if assigned.
     7.3.3.2. (Form 8a) Use the latest completion date of all MDS listed.
     7.3.3.3. (Added-AFMC) Normally, the AF Form 8/8a is left “open” until all flight
     evaluation and ground requisites are complete. When requisites are not completed within
     the prescribed period, close the AF Form 8. When a less than qualified grade is awarded
     on any requisite or evaluation or the examinee is placed in a supervised status, close the
     AF Form 8.
  7.3.4. - Examinee Identification.
     7.3.4.1. Name, Rank (USAF-standard abbreviated or non-abbreviated rank is acceptable)
     and last four of Social Security Number (SSN).
     7.3.4.2. Organization and Location.
         7.3.4.2.1. Enter the unit designation and location where the examinee is
         assigned/attached for flying (actual unit/office symbol will be annotated IAW
         paragraph 7.3.6.4).
         7.3.4.2.2. For FTU courses in which an evaluation is administered, the organization
         and location will reflect the FTU organization/location.
     7.3.4.3. Aircraft/Crew Position.
         7.3.4.3.1. Enter the MDS in which the evaluation was given
         7.3.4.3.1. (AFMC) Enter MD (mission and design) for SPOT ground evaluations
         (i.e. EPE).
         7.3.4.3.2. (Form 8a) Enter the aircraft MDS in which the flight phase evaluation
         was given. When no flight phase evaluation was accomplished or when aircrew are
         qualified in two or more aircraft IAW Universal Qualification guidelines, enter the
         primary aircraft MDS.

            7.3.4.3.3. Enter the examinee’s highest qualification reflecting the intention of the
            evaluation in that particular MDS. Note: Examiner (e.g. EP, EF, etc.) is not a
            qualification, it is a certification, and should only be entered when the flight examiner
            is receiving a SPOT Flight Examiner Objectivity evaluation IAW MAJCOM
            supplements.
            7.3.4.3.4. (Added-AFMC) For aircrew maintaining qualification in more than one

     separate AF Form 8a for each MDS with flight phase evaluations IAW multiple
     qualification guidance in paragraph 5.10 and universal qualification guidance in
     paragraph 5.11.
     7.3.5.2.1. (AFMC) A flight phase evaluation is not required for non-rated (X-prefix)
     or Flight Surgeons. Document local requirements in the unit supplement to this
     instruction.     All initial aircraft qualifications will be documented on
     separate/individual Form(s) 8a. Consolidate all Forms 8a into a single document
     during the next phase (recurring) period. Additional initial aircraft qualifications
     gained outside of the recurring Form 8a eligibility period may be documented on a
     separate Form 8a.
     7.3.5.2.2. Mission/Check.
        7.3.5.2.2.1. IAW paragraph 5.2, use the following designations to describe the
        purpose of the evaluation(s): INSTM, QUAL, MSN, INSTR, or SPOT. If
        combined, include the designation of each evaluation (e.g., QUAL/MSN,
        INSTM/QUAL/MSN, etc.).
        7.3.5.2.2.2. Use the following prefixes, when applicable, to describe the type of
        evaluation: INIT, RQ, N/N and/or SIM. More than one prefix may be used to
        describe an evaluation as outlined in paragraph 5.2.6.
            7.3.5.2.2.2.1. The only annotations of INSTR used are INIT INSTR and RQ
            INSTR as described in paragraph 5.2.4.
            7.3.5.2.2.2.2. INSTR will not be used for periodic evaluations as the AF Form
            8/8a aircraft/crew position is already annotated with the instructor designation
            (e.g. IB, IN, IP)
            7.3.5.2.2.2.3. When requalification deals with regaining a complete loss of
            instructor qualification, document it as RQ INSTR (not RQ SPOT).
        7.3.5.2.2.3. Make a single line entry to document the flight(s)/event(s) used to
        complete the evaluation.
        7.3.5.2.2.4. Make multiple single line entries for each flight/event if two or more
        flights/events are required and administered by either different flight examiners or
        on separate days.
        7.3.5.2.2.5. Where a single mission (such as airlift tasking) consists of multiple
        flights over one or more days with the same flight examiners, a single line entry
        may be used.
     7.3.5.2.3. Date.
        7.3.5.2.3.1. Enter the date the flight/event was completed.
        7.3.5.2.3.2. For evaluations where a single mission consists of multiple flights
        over one or more days (see paragraph 7.3.5.2.2.5), enter the inclusive dates of the
        flight(s). Document the details IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.2.
        7.3.5.2.3.3. For evaluations conducted on missions consisting of a single flight
        spanning more than one day, use a single line entry with the date the mission was
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011                                                            57


            completed. Document the details IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.2.
     7.3.5.3. Qualification Level.
        7.3.5.3.1. Annotate the examinee’s overall qualification level IAW the definitions of
        paragraph 5.3.3 by placing a “1” (for Q1) or “2” (for Q2) in the qualified block or a
        “3” (for Q3) in the unqualified block.
        7.3.5.3.2. Combined evaluations (e.g., INSTM/QUAL, INSTM/QUAL/MSN, etc.)
        require only one grade if all evaluations were awarded the same overall level.
            7.3.5.3.2.1. If the overall level varies for each type of evaluation accomplished,
            indicate the qualification level for each part separately (e.g., “INSTM: 1” and
            “QUAL: 2” in the qualified block or “INSTM/MSN: 1” in the qualified block and
            “QUAL: 3” in the unqualified block).
        7.3.5.3.3. (Form 8a) Place a 1, 2, or 3 in the Qual Level block next to the applicable
        flight phase.
        7.3.5.3.4. (Form 8a) This section does not apply to Universal Qualified aircrew
        members or to crewmembers that do not require a flight phase evaluation (see
        Chapter 8).
     7.3.5.4. Expiration Date of Qualification.

        phase of the evaluation was successfully completed.
        7.3.5.4.2. For evaluations that do not establish a new eligibility period, enter “N/A.”
        7.3.5.4.3. Combined evaluations require only one date if all parts of the evaluation
        were successfully completed and/or “N/A” if all parts were assigned an unqualified
        grade.
            7.3.5.4.3.1. For combined evaluations where one component is successfully
            completed and/or one component is assigned an unqualified grade, indicate by
            assigning a new expiration date for those portions completed successfully, and
            “N/A” for those portions awarded an unqualified grade (e.g., QUAL 1 and
            INSTM 3, then enter “QUAL-Jul 12” under Qualified and “INSTM-N/A” under
            Unqualified).
        7.3.5.4.4. (Form 8a) For evaluations without a flight phase requirement that
        establish a new eligibility period enter the month and year that is 17 months after the
        month in which the latest ground requisite was successfully completed.
        7.3.5.4.4. (AFMC) For initial aircraft qualifications, the first (oldest) Forms 8a
        expiration date determines the expiration date for all subsequent initial Forms 8a
        qualifications. All additional aircraft will expire on the same date. Subsequent
        recurring evaluations (consolidated on a single Form 8a) will expire on the date of the
        first aircraft evaluation administered with requisites completed within the eligibility
        period.
58                                               AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011


        7.3.5.4.5. (Form 8a) For evaluations with a flight phase that establish a new
        eligibility period, enter the month and year that is 17 months after the month in which
        the flight phase evaluation was successfully completed.

         applicable) must be graded Q/1 with no discrepancies.
  7.3.6. – Certification Signatures.
     7.3.6.1. Flight Examiner.
         7.3.6.1.1. (Form 8a) With only ground phase requisites required, any unit
         designated flight examiner can sign the AF Form 8a.
         7.3.6.1.2. The flight examiner signing Section III of the AF Form 8:
            7.3.6.1.2.1. Is responsible for the content of the AF Form 8/8a, and will not sign
            Section III until verifying all required items (IAW this AFI and AFI 11-2MDS
            Vol 2) are documented.
            7.3.6.1.2.2. Will always place an “X” in the remarks block and make comments
            in the comments block
                7.3.6.1.2.2.1. (Form 8a) This applies only when a flight phase is required; if
                only a ground phase is required, do not place an "X" in the remarks block and
                no Examiner Remarks are required in the Comments block in Section IV.
         7.3.6.1.3. If two or more flights are required to complete an evaluation, only the
         flight examiner completing the evaluation will sign Section III, any other evaluator(s)
         will enter remarks in the Mission Description block describing those parts of the
         flight evaluation they evaluated and sign a signature block immediately adjacent to
         their remarks (see examples in Attachment 3).
         7.3.6.1.3. (AFMC) Each examiner will document as a minimum Examiner’s
         remarks, part A and B. The examiner’s signature block will reflect the examiner’s
         name, grade and organization.
     7.3.6.2. Reviewing and Final Approving Officers.
         7.3.6.2.1. (Form 8a) A Reviewing Officer is not required for non-rated aircrew with
         only ground phase examination requisites for qualification.
         7.3.6.2.1. (AFMC) A reviewing officer is required for AFMC operations.
         7.3.6.2.2. The Reviewing and Final Approving Officers (those officers holding these
         positions, or acting in their stead during the period of the signature process -- not
         necessarily the date of the evaluation) will review the content of the AF Form 8/8a
         and the flight examiner’s overall assessment, ensure all required additional training is
         adequate to correct the noted deficiencies and is complete, and will place an “X” in
         the “Concur” block.
            7.3.6.2.2.1. If either or both officers do not agree with any portion of the Form
            8/8a, the overall grade will not be changed, but the dissenting officer will place an
            “X” in the “Do Not Concur” block on his/her line of the AF Form 8/8a.
            7.3.6.2.2.2. If “Do Not Concur” is marked, the non-concurring officer(s) will
            provide justification (e.g. reason for non-concurrence, suggested modifications to
 60                                               AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011


              additional training as recommended by the flight examiner, etc.) IAW paragraph
              7.3.7.4 and/or paragraph 7.3.7.5.
           7.3.6.2.3. The Reviewing Officer will sign and date the AF Form 8/8a after the flight
           examiner, but prior to the Final Approval Officer.
           7.3.6.2.4. The Final Approval Officer will sign and date the AF Form 8/8a after the
           Reviewing Officer but prior to the examinee. As applicable, the Final Approving
           Officer may recommend or give a commander-directed downgrade IAW paragraph
           5.9 if further action is warranted.
           7.3.6.2.5. MAJCOMs will specify in the MAJCOM supplement who the reviewing
           and final approving officers will be for evaluations other than formal course
           evaluations accomplished at an FTU. The same individual will not sign as both the
           Reviewing and Final Approving Officer.
           7.3.6.2.5. (AFMC) The examiner, reviewer, and approving officer should all be
           different individuals for any particular AF Form 8. In addition to providing an
           additional level of command oversight, the Reviewing Officer is responsible for
           quality control of the AF Form 8/8a format and is also responsible for ensuring the
           content of the AF Form 8/8a is in compliance with this instruction and AFMC
           supplement. Therefore, the Reviewing Officer should be currently involved in the
           Stan/Eval operations of the unit; however, where the Unit Chief of Stan/Eval is the
           examinee or the examiner, the Final Approving Officer will designate an appropriate
           Reviewing Officer. The Final Approving Officer is responsible for certifying the
           qualifications attested to on the AF Form 8/8a and should be the flying unit
           commander or OG/CC. The next higher available level of flying oversight should
           approve flying unit commander evaluations. The levels of flying oversight are flying

7.6. AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications (Optional). See Attachment 7 for sample
AF Forms 4348.
7.6. (AFMC)Used to document completion of Aircraft Conversion/Difference training of
primary (rated and CEA) aircrew for all AFMC units and AFRC units under AFMC
OPCON. The Form 4348 is not applicable to non-rated (X-prefix) or Flight Surgeons.
   7.6.1. Purpose. The AF Form 4348 provides a record of aircrew certification that may be
   kept in the FEF.
   7.6.1. (AFMC) List each variant (MDS) for which conversion/difference training has been
   completed. See example in Attachment 7. File the Form 4348 in the FEF.
      7.6.1.1. Maintain a separate AF Form 4348 in the FEF, Section I, under tab 1
      documenting certifications by assigned flying unit and primary MDS. For aircrew
      members with aircraft certifications in multiple MDS aircraft which do not require
      qualification in each aircraft (e.g. F-16C and F-16CM), only one AF Form 4348 is
      required; specify the primary mission MDS designation.
      7.6.1.1. (AFMC) Maintain a separate AF Form 4348 for each MD qualified in. A
      separate line entry for each MDS variant, though not required is desired, and may be of
      benefit in the event of decertification. An AF Form 4348 is not required for aircraft for
      which there is only one MDS (ie B-52H or F-22A)
      7.6.1.2. Unit Stan/Eval will document all initial, downgrade and re-certifications for
      aircrew assigned/attached to their flying unit to indicate a chronological history of
      certifications of aircrew while assigned/attached to their flying unit.
      7.6.1.3. During the initial review of individual FEF, also review previous AF Form 4348
      entries to determine all applicable certifications of new assigned/attached aircrew
      member. Then, document applicable aircrew certifications accepted by the gaining flying
      unit commander on a new AF Form 4348.
      7.6.1.3. (AFMC) The MDS variants documented on the Acceptance of Qualification
      Letter will be listed on the Form 4348 as “Previous Qual”. Subsequent certifications will
      be annotated in chronological order. See example in Attachment 7.
      7.6.1.4. The OGV/squadron Stan/Eval Chief or other individual designated by the
      SQ/CC will sign a one line entry below all other entries verifying that above certification
      transcriptions are accurate.

 7.6.4. Decertification. Decertification of events fall into two categories: Decertification for
 Cause (with prejudice) and Discretionary Decertification (without prejudice).
     7.6.4.1. Decertification for Cause. Used for observed substandard performance.
         7.6.4.1.1. This action is normally associated with Commander-Directed Downgrade,
         but also applies to commander-directed decertification of evaluators (resulting from
         substandard performance).
         7.6.4.1.2. To document Decertification for Cause, place an “X” in the appropriate
         box; enter date of decertification under Decertification Date block; enter name, rank,
         organization and office symbol and signature of the decertifying official under
         Decertifying Official/Organization block; see Attachment 7 for example.
     7.6.4.2. Discretionary Decertification. An administrative action not based on
     performance.
         7.6.4.2.1. Such decertification is warranted when loss of currency or certification
         occurs that will not be regained IAW AFI11-2 Vol 1, when instructor certified events
         become core mission events, or when a higher certification is obtained making the
         previous entry obsolete. Discretionary Decertification is also applicable for
         decertification of flight examiners as a result of reasons other than substandard
         performance.
         7.6.4.2.2. To document Discretionary Decertification, place an “X” in the appropriate
         box; enter date of decertification under Decertification Date block; enter name, rank,
         organization and office symbol and signature of the decertifying official under
         Decertifying Official/Organization block; see Attachment 7. Note: For decertification
         due to loss of currency with no requirement for re-certification, the effective date of
         decertification will be the date of certification loss.
         7.6.4.2.3. For events that have changed in name only (e.g., In-Flight Refueling to Air
         Refueling) no action is necessary. If desired for clarity: annotate “Renamed (new
         title)” under Remarks.
         7.6.4.2.4. For members who change MDS while assigned/attached to the same
         Stan/Eval organization, prepare a new AF Form 4348 indicating the new MDS and
         transcribe all events which apply to the new MDS IAW paragraph 7.6.1.3.
  7.6.5. Unusual Circumstances. When unusual circumstances require additional
  information for an AF Form 4348 entry, use additional lines as necessary or reaccomplish the
  AF Form 4348.
 7.6.6. Computer Generated AF Forms 4348. Units may use a computer-generated AF
 Form 4348 to make new entries or corrections as long as cumulative hard copy entries are
 maintained. Computer-generated AF forms must mirror AF forms published on the Air Force
 e-Publishing web site.
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011                                                             71


      7.6.6.1. A computer-generated AF Form 4348 must be signed IAW guidance in this

        7.8.4.3. Affix a label bearing the individual’s name and last four of SSN to the inside
        back cover so that the folder may be identified when filed. Include additional information
        on the label if required by MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
        7.8.4.4. Folders must bear the “For Official Use Only” label/stamp on both sides of the
        FEF.
 7.8.5. Review of FEF. Document the procedures on how to accomplish an initial review
 and how to implement the periodic review of FEFs.
        7.8.5.1. Initial Review. The flying unit will review the FEF for all newly assigned
        aircrew members to verify their qualification(s) (and certifications on AF Form 4348 if
        used) prior to their first flight.
           7.8.5.1.1. The reviewing organization is responsible for establishing the qualification
           of the aircrew member as determined from the latest applicable documentation in
           Sections I and II of the FEF.
           7.8.5.1.2. Following the initial review, the unit maintaining the FEF is responsible
           only for documentation subsequently placed in the FEF.
           7.8.5.1.3. If the FEF of HHQ personnel on active flying status is maintained by the
           Stan/Eval function at the unit/squadron to which they are attached to fly, the
           Stan/Eval function of that unit/squadron will also review the FEF prior to their first
           flight.
        7.8.5.2. Posting Review.
           7.8.5.2.1. The Stan/Eval function will review each AF Form 8/8a and AF Forms
           4348 (if used) when they are placed in the FEF to ensure accuracy and completeness.
           7.8.5.2.2. The Form 8/8a review will confirm that the eligibility period and
           qualification as documented are correct, all required flight evaluation events and
           requisites were accomplished within the eligibility period and that all signatures and
           initials are obtained within the allotted time (see paragraph 7.3.8.5).
           7.8.5.2.3. The AF Form 4348 (if used) will be reviewed for correct certification
           signature and to ensure all previous entries are accurate and accounted for.
           7.8.5.2.4. Document the posting review IAW unit or MAJCOM supplement.
           7.8.5.2.4. (AFMC) Document procedures for the posting                review   in   unit
           supplements. This review may be accomplished electronically.

                                          Chapter 8

                                SPECIALIZED AIRCREW

8.1. Purpose. This chapter provides additional guidance pertaining to flight surgeons, Combat
Camera, and non-rated aircrew that only require an examination to establish qualification.
8.1. (AFMC)Specialized Aircrew procedures are not applicable to AFMC non-rated (X-
prefix) aircrew. Aerial Photographer is considered a Phase II qualification for Mission Aircrew
(MA).
   8.1.1. Initial and periodic qualification consists of a written (open or closed book)
   examination; a flight evaluation is not required. Upon completion of the examination,
   members will be qualified in all USAF aircraft (universal qualification).
   8.1.2. MAJCOMs and subordinate units may direct additional general and/or MDS-Specific
   qualification requirements.
   8.1.3. Qualification requirements will be documented on an AF Form 1522, ARMS
   Additional Training Accomplishment Report, and stored in ARMS in the Formal Training
   module with currency tracked in the Training module. No AF Form 8/8a or FEF is required;
   however, the Stan/Eval function of the unit to which specialized aircrew are
   assigned/attached for flying will verify that ARMS information is logged appropriately.
   When MAJCOMs or subordinate units require a flight phase, or if directed by the applicable
   MDS-Specific Volume 2, document IAW Chapter 7 (to include creating an FEF).
8.2. Evaluations. Initial, periodic, and MDS-Specific (if required) examinations are considered
QUAL evaluations. Other examinations are not required by this AFI, but may be prescribed in
MAJCOM and subordinate unit supplements.
   8.2.1. Flight Surgeons. Test questions will be randomly generated from a test bank
   maintained by AFMOA/SG3P.
   8.2.1. (AFMC) Flight Surgeons (assigned/attached/other MAJCOMs) flying with AFMC
   flight organizations will complete an MDS specific examination for each aircraft flown. See
   Chap 7 for documentation requirements using the AF Form 8a.
   8.2.2. Combat Camera. Test questions will be randomly generated from a test bank
   maintained by the Combat Camera career field manager (CFM), in coordination with HQ
   USAF/A3O-AT and using commands.
   8.2.3. Non-Rated Aircrew Members. Test questions will come from the lead MAJCOM
   Master Question Files (MQFs).

                          EVALUATIONS)

9.1. FCIF.
   9.1.1. Units will establish and maintain a library consisting of a current read file and
   publications. This library will consist of a minimum of four volumes as listed in Table 9.1 in
   either hardcopy or electronic format.
   9.1.2. FCIFs may be issued to alert crewmembers to publications changes for TOs or AFIs
   that affect aircraft operations, but actual publication changes must be accomplished IAW
   established procedural guidance, to include AFI 33-360 (as applicable) and TO 00-5-1.
   9.1.3. Required Volumes. Volume I is a table of contents for all volumes and current read
   file items, Volumes II through IV are made up of publications and flight manuals, and
   Volume V (optional) is reserved for flight safety information. If units choose hardcopy
   format and the contents of any volume exceed the capacity of its binder, use an additional
   binder and identify the first and subsequent binders by a letter of sequence (e.g., IIIA, IIIB).
   Label binders on the spine indicating Volume and Title as follows:
   9.1.3. (AFMC) Publications within the FCIF may be paper copies as designated in the list
   in paragraph 9.1.3.3.1 (Added) and paragraph 9.1.3.3.2 (Added) when applicable. Include
   MAJCOM, center, and local supplements. Flight Crew Information File (FCIF) libraries may
   be located for dual-use provided the requirements below are met. Place a Table of Contents
   in a separate book and label appropriately. The Table of contents will indicate the location

       SII.
       9.2.2.5. Effective date of rescission
       9.2.2.6. SME/POC for further information
   9.2.3. SII(s) will be of limited duration (generally not to exceed 90 days).
   9.2.4. SII(s) may be issued/rescinded from the HAF, MAJCOM, NAF or unit level. If issued
   from agencies outside the MAJCOMs (e.g. HAF, HQ AFFSA, but not subordinate NAFs or
   units), the lead MAJCOM stan/eval function will coordinate the intent and verbiage of the
   SII with other MAJCOM stan/eval functions in order to determine the level of applicability
   within the individual MAJCOMs prior to release.
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_I 12 JULY 2011                                                             83

   operational problems, such as negative checkride trends. The form and content of a
   supplementary evaluation is at the discretion of the commander directing it.
   9.4.2. Supplementary evaluations are not aircrew qualification evaluations.
   9.4.3. The commander directing the supplementary evaluation will determine the areas to be
   evaluated. The Stan/Eval function directly under the commander directing the supplementary
   evaluation will determine the method of evaluation, is responsible for administrative
   management of data collection, and will report results as directed by the commander.
   9.4.4. Individuals other than flight examiners, as determined by the commander directing the
   supplementary evaluation, may participate in its conduct.
   9.4.5. Supplementary evaluations may be administered in conjunction with a flight
   evaluation. If conducted in-flight, supplementary evaluations will not be all-encompassing,
   result in the assignment of an overall grade or be documented on an AF Form 8/8a.

9.7. (Added-AFMC) AFMC Form 84, Flight Crew Information File Certification. The
AFMC Form 84 (or suitable alternate to include COOL) will be used to document FCIF
certification by primary assigned and attached aircrew personnel. Units will develop a Go/No-Go
process to ensure aircrews have completed all applicable requirements prior to flight. Primary
aircrew must review the FCIF prior to their first flight and then at least once annually. The
AFMC Forms 84 need not be maintained for mission support aircrew.
      9.7.1. (Added-AFMC) FCIF notices may be issued by AFMC/A3V, Operations Group
      OGV, Chiefs of Stan/Eval or unit SELOs. FCIF items include information that applies to
      current ground/flight operations. The issuing authority establishes an expiration date for each
      FCIF item. FCIF items of a permanent nature need no expiration date, but should be
      incorporated into local directives when practical. FCIF monitors will conduct a review every
      90 days to ensure currency of the file and to remove expired notices. Retain removed notices
      in a dead file for a period of 120 days. Use AFMC Form 50, Flight Crew Information File as
      a transmittal sheet for all FCIF entries. If COOL is used to generate FCIFs at the Group or
      lower level, the Form 50 is not required. Each level of Stan/Eval will develop a local control
      numbering system and distribute to appropriate units. The FCIF will be posted no later than
      the following morning after receipt.
         9.7.1.1. (AFMC) AFMC FCIFs can be retrieved in digital Format from the AFMC
         SharePoint.
   9.7.2. (Added-AFMC) If used, Forms 84 annual reviews are annotated on the top section of
   the Form. Indicate FCIF currency for guest aircrews on the flight authorization AF Form
   4327 or AF Form 4327a, as applicable, with FCIF number and initials next to the crew
   member’s name. Old cards must be kept for 1 year. Electronically kept versions should be
   readily available through a medium that allows for reliable easy access to aircrews and unit
   supervision. The unit will prescribe backup procedures to the electronic data.
      9.7.3. (Added-AFMC) Units will establish procedures to ensure FCIF currency for aircrews
      operating away from home station.
      9.7.4. (Added-AFMC) Aircraft commanders are responsible for ensuring FCIF currency
      for all crewmembers, to include mission crew.

EXCEPTIONALLY QUALIFIED: The examinee demonstrated exceptional aircraft handling
and instrument skills during all phases of this evaluation. Rapidly changing weather and denial
of service at two planned out-bases caused the examinee to have to change his plan several
times in-flight, each time done quickly and efficiently so that all aspects of the mission could
still be accomplished.
