            PROCESSING AGE DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINTS
                  PROCEDURES:
                                 (1) The Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) prohibits discrimination in
                  employment on the basis of age (40 years or older). An aggrieved person may file a formal
                  administrative complaint with the agency under Title 29 Code of Federal Regulation Part 1614. Once
                  the aggrieved person elects to file an administrative complaint, all administrative remedies must be
                  exhausted before he or she may file a civil action in US District Court.

                                 (2) An aggrieved person may bypass the formal administrative complaint process in
                  Part 1614, and file a civil action directly in US District Court after first giving the EEOC not less than
                  30 days written notice of intent to sue under ADEA. Such notice must be filed within 180 calendar
                  days of the date of the alleged discriminatory action. Since the statute of limitations in ADEA cases
                  is not consistently applied by the courts, an aggrieved person wishing to bypass the administrative
                  process should initiate the civil action as soon as possible after the expiration of the 30-day waiting
                  period which follows the notice of intent to sue.
