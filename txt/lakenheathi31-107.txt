1. UKCF Mission. To manage, supervise and direct inmates/detainees confined in the UKCF,
and to provide for the health and welfare of inmates/detainees. To provide proper administration
and coordination involving the transfer of inmates/detainees and necessary guidance associated
with overseeing the operation of the facility. Inmates/detainees will conduct themselves with
proper military behavior while assigned to the UKCF.
2. UKCF Environment. In any environment where individuals must reside together as
members of a community, certain rules and restrictions are established. This ensures the safety,
security, and welfare of each individual within the community. These rules are designed for the
 4                                                         LAKENHEATHI31-107 5 JULY 2012


inmate/detainee’s welfare, yet every rule may not be outlined specifically. Let basic common
sense and obedience to orders be the key. By following orders, obeying rules and instructions,
and giving full cooperation in all regards to the UKCF staff, inmates and detainees will be
preparing for either return to duty or to civilian life. Failure to comply with these rules, or failure
to cooperate with UKCF staff, may result in action as prescribed by AFI 31-205, Corrections
Program, or the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).
3. Staff Responsibilities. Staff personnel assigned to the UKCF are responsible for the safe
custody of inmates/detainees until released by proper authority, and to assist inmates/detainees in
self-improvement and adjustment to acceptable standards.
4. Attitude, Behavior, and Work Performance. Pre-trial personnel are considered lawfully
detained by legal definition. Therefore, all pre-trial personnel are considered to be detainees and
not inmates. However, all Airmen and Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs) placed in
Confinement staff positions have been appointed to this position by an officer. Therefore, all
Confinement Guards have authority over detainees when making decisions affecting this facility,
enforcing written or oral policies, and guidelines. Every action of an inmate and detainee will
have a consequence. Inmates/detainees will maintain their dignity, respect the rights of others,
and practice common social courtesies. Inmates/detainees will not fight the system or become
disruptive toward the UKCF staff or other inmates/detainees. When an inmate/detainee becomes
belligerent, the order of DECK will be called out. Inmates/Detainees will sit on the ground, legs
crossed, and their fingers interlaced behind their head without saying anything. See Attachment
5, Figure A5.1. Deck Demonstration.
5. Lawful Orders. Inmates/detainees will promptly and fully obey all verbal and written orders
given by competent military authority. If they feel they have just cause for a complaint
concerning an order, they may request an interview with the Confinement Officer or the Non-
Commissioned Officer In-Charge (NCOIC), United Kingdom (UK) Corrections using a
Department of Defense (DD) Form 510, Request for Interview, as prescribed by Army
Regulation 190_47, The Army Corrections System, after they obey the order. Posted orders will
not be marked, defaced, destroyed, withdrawn, or tampered with by an inmate/detainee.
6. Military Courtesy and Reporting Procedures. Courtesy reflects attitude and adjustment,
and is an important indicator of proper behavior.
     6.1. When reporting to a commissioned officer, inmates/detainees are required to salute
     (unless the inmate has received an executed punitive discharge) and address them as "Sir" or
     "Ma'am," as applicable. Enlisted personnel will be addressed by their full rank. For
     example, “Technical Sergeant” or “Senior Airman.”
     6.2. When being inspected by a commissioned or non-commissioned officer,
     inmates/detainees will stand at attention until the inspector directs otherwise or departs.
     6.3. Inmates/detainees standing outside during reveille or retreat will render all proper
     military courtesies.
     6.4. Inmates/detainees will stand at attention when addressed by any active duty military
     individual in the performance of their duties.
     6.5. Inmates/detainees will rise and stand at the position of attention when any member of
     the UKCF staff enters the inmate/detainee’s living areas, to include any area beyond the
LAKENHEATHI31-107 5 JULY 2012                                                                      5


   doorway from the guard station to the day room. If a commissioned officer enters the
   inmate/detainee’s living area, the first inmate/detainee to observe them will call the facility to
   "ATTENTION." Exceptions would be if there is an individual of equal or higher rank
   already within the facility. When given the order "CARRY ON" or "AS YOU WERE," etc.,
   inmates/detainees will assume the position of parade rest.
   6.6. When non-inmate/detainee personnel walk through the facility, inmates/detainees will
   move to the side of the area or hallway and assume the position of attention. When
   instructed to "CARRY ON" or "AS YOU WERE," etc., the inmate/detainee will continue
   with what they were doing. At no time will any inmate or detainee walk past a staff member
   or visitor in the facility without the explicit permission of the staff member present.    To
   pass a staff member, you will stop 6 paces in front of them at attention, give your reporting
   statement, and ask “PERMISSION TO PASS?” The staff member will then either say
   “YES” or “NO.”
7. Reporting Procedures. When reporting to any UKCF Staff member the following
procedures will be strictly adhered to:
   7.1. Inmates/detainees will stand at the position of attention and render a reporting statement
   starting with the individuals rank (example: "Staff Sergeant, inmate/detainee reports") and
   remain at attention until instructed otherwise.
      7.1.1. Before reporting to the guard station, inmates/detainees will ensure they are in full
      uniform.
          7.1.1.1. If required to report during facility clean up, the pre-approved modified
          uniform allowed during clean up will be authorized.
          7.1.1.2. If it is during free time, inmates/detainees do not need to be in uniform
          unless directed otherwise.
      7.1.2. When reporting to the guard station, stop at the doorway, knock once, and wait to
      be acknowledged. Once acknowledged, enter the office area, stand at attention in front of
      the window next to the inmate/detainee’s phone, and face the front of the desk. Once
      acknowledged, render reporting statement. Remain at attention until instructed
      otherwise.
          7.1.2.1. When reporting to the guard station after meals for clean up, inmates will
          carry out the procedures from paragraph 7.1.2., then once acknowledged, inmates will
          render their reporting statement and ask, “PERMISSION TO CLEAN GUARD
          STATION, BACK HALL and VISITATION ROOM.” Note: The Visitation room
          will only be cleaned after breakfast.
          7.1.2.2. After the on-duty Confinement Guard acknowledges the question, the inmate
          will ask, “PERMISSION TO MOVE FREELY?”
          7.1.2.3. Again, once acknowledged, the inmate will ask, “PERMISSION TO FALL
          IN FOR CLEANING SUPPLIES?”
          7.1.2.4. Lastly, once the on-duty Confinement Guard acknowledges the question, the
          inmate will fall back into the dayroom to retrieve the cleaning supplies.
 6                                                       LAKENHEATHI31-107 5 JULY 2012

as confidential.
   24.1. Chaplains are concerned with the spiritual welfare, moral, and character development
   of inmates/detainees. Chaplains can give counseling and assistance relative to any

   chaplains. All recognized religions sanctioned by the US Armed Forces and Chaplain
   Services may hold services within the facility. Certain restrictions may apply depending on
   the practices of that religion such as the introduction of alcoholic beverages or food products.
   Requests to consult with a chaplain will be submitted on a DD Form 510.
   24.3. Chaplains make regular visits to the UKCF. If an inmate/detainee desires to see a
   chaplain of a certain denomination, the inmate/detainee will make the request through the on-
   duty Confinement Guard. The on-duty Confinement Guard will inform the inmate/detainee
   of when that chaplain makes his/her visits.
25. American Red Cross. Inmates/detainees may request an interview with the American Red
Cross concerning matters of health and welfare of their family members or the inmates/detainees
personal affairs. Requests to consult with the American Red Cross will be submitted on a DD

   26.1. Maximum Custody:          For inmates/detainees who require close and constant
   supervision. Whenever they are outside the facility, two security forces personnel will escort
   them; at least one will be armed. Privileges for maximum custody inmates/detainees are very
   limited.
   26.2. Medium-In Custody. For inmates/detainees who require constant supervision. These
   inmates/detainees pose an escape risk; however, they do not present a substantial threat to
   others. Assign this Custody Grade to inmates who demonstrate a poor adjustment to
   confinement. Initially assign all inmates/detainees to Medium-In Custody. All pre-trial
   detainees will remain in this custody grade.
   26.3. Medium-Out Custody. For inmates who pose a minimal escape risk. Assign Medium-
   Out inmates work details outside the facility with proper escort.
27. Abatement of Sentences. DoD policy on abatement of sentences for all prisoners in DoD

   27.1. Good Conduct Time (GCT). GCT is a predetermined amount of time deducted from
   an inmate’s sentence based upon the adjudged sentence received. Upon beginning a
   sentence, all GCT an inmate can earn during their sentence is credited to them. Shortly after
   in-processing inmates are briefed on their minimum and maximum release dates awarded for
   their adjudged sentence. The Defense Force Commander (DFC), when recommended by the
   Confinement Officer or NCOIC, UK Corrections, may take all or part of an inmate’s GCT
   for failure to faithfully observe facility rules and regulations.
   27.2. Earned Time (ET). ET may be awarded by the DFC to inmates actively participating
   in productive activities, provided appropriate activities and programs are available. If an
   inmate receives any ET, a new sentence computation worksheet will be accomplished
   monthly to reflect the new release date and the inmate will be notified.
   27.3. Special Acts Abatements (SAA). Sentence reduction may be awarded at the discretion
   of the confinement facility commander for specific acts of heroism, humanitarianism, or
   extraordinary institutional or community support. Note: For further details of the various
   abatements refer to AFI 31-205, and DoDI 1325.7., Administration of Military Correctional
   Facilities and Clemency and Parole Authority, Appendix 4.
28. Employment of Inmates. Inmates on work details are expressly prohibited from using
telephones, mail service, delivering or accepting any items not specifically required for their
detail, fraternizing with any individual(s), or communicating with any person(s) except for
official business. Inmates will obey all lawful orders of the detail supervisor. Work breaks are
taken at the discretion of the detail supervisor. Breaks may not exceed 15 minutes per hour.
   28.1. Inmates will not perform any type of labor that is not consistent with their custody
   grade, physical and mental condition, sentence status, or previous training. Any legitimate
   task, which the Confinement staff would ordinarily assign to a duty Airman, is proper for
   adjudged and sentenced inmates.
   28.2. Confined officer inmates/detainees are not required to perform labor within the facility,
   but will perform house cleaning and stripping/buffing duties of their assigned cell area.
   Officer inmates/detainees may submit a written request for other work assignments. The
   DFC must review and approve such requests.
   28.3. Confined enlisted detainees are not required to perform labor within the facility, but
   will perform house cleaning and stripping/buffing duties of their assigned cell area. They
   may submit a written request to the on-duty correctional staff for other detail assignments
   outside their assigned cell, commensurate with their grade.
29. Base Exercises and Alerts. Inmates/detainees will work outside the exercise areas, and will
march in formation to and from the UKCF. Inmates/detainees and on-duty Confinement Guards
will not wear chemical ensembles during the exercises.
30. Articles Authorized in Possession of Inmates/detainees. The guidelines below are not all-
inclusive, and there may be individual cases that alter these general allowances.
Inmates/detainees will be specifically told if there is any additional item(s) they may possess, or
any of these items that they may not possess. Any authorization to possess additional items on a
continual basis will be authorized in writing by the Confinement Officer or NCOIC, UK
Corrections. A single occurrence of an additional authorization may be specified verbally by the
on-duty Confinement Guard. Attachment 3, Bed Linen Display, Attachment 4, Wall Locker

33. The Air Force Return to Duty Program (RTDP). The Air Force maintains a service
unique RTDP (reference 10 USC Section 953) located at Lackland AFB, TX. The program
offers selected court-martialed enlisted personnel with exceptional potential the opportunity to be
returned to active duty and have their punitive discharge, if adjudged, remitted. Program
participants, referred to as candidates, live in housing relatively free of physical security, and
control measures as much as possible. There is no social segregation by sex. They are provided
with therapy and education programs individually designed to improve their conduct, attitude,
and productivity for continued Air Force service.
   33.1. HQ AFSFC/CC has the ultimate responsibility for administering the RTDP.
   33.2. To be eligible for the RTDP applicants must:
       33.2.1. Not have an executed discharge or be retirement eligible and not be past their
       ETS.
 24                                                     LAKENHEATHI31-107 5 JULY 2012


       33.2.2. Be enlisted and have been court-martialed.
       33.2.3. Have a minimum of 30 days confinement remaining upon arrival at the RTDP or
       be willing to exceed their maximum release date. Refer to AFI 31-205, paragraph
       11.6.4.1 for more information. The Convening Authority (CA) or the Air Force
       Clemency and Parole Board (AFC&PB) may waive the minimum time requirement.
       33.2.4. Accept responsibility for their crime(s) and have a strong desire to change
       negative attitudes and behaviors.
       33.2.5. Be approved for worldwide duty by medical authorities.
       33.2.6. Have personality characteristics, as established by a psycho-social mental health
       evaluation, that on balance support a reasonable expectation of successful rehabilitation.
       No specific personality characteristics guarantee success or failure, but some personality
       attributes are assets and others are hindrances to successful rehabilitation. A mental
       health specialist, counselor, or psychologist may complete the psycho-social mental
       health evaluation.
       33.2.7. Have no record of violent sex offenses. Any entry approval authority can, in
       exceptional cases, waive this prohibition against violent offenders. Only the AFC&PB
       may waive this prohibition against sex offenders, who have completed treatment. Before
       applying for the RTDP, all drug abusers, violent and sexual offenders must have
       completed a crime-specific evaluation by Mental Health or Alcohol and Drug Awareness
       Prevention Team (ADAPT), as appropriate. The results of this evaluation must be part of
       the application.
       33.2.8. Have no more than a limited history of prior civilian and military offenses.
       33.2.9. Have a positive record of military training, experience, and performance.
   33.3. Entry into the RTDP and completion of program requirements do not guarantee
   subsequent return to duty. Upon completion of the RTDP, the candidate’s progress and
   training records will be reviewed by the AFC&PB, which will decide if the candidate shall be
   returned to active duty.
   33.4. Be advised that this is just some of the information on the Air Force RTDP. For all the
   information, refer to AFI 31-205, paragraph 11.6.
34. Formal Complaint Process. Inmates/detainees can lodge formal complaints through the
UKCF staff to the NCOIC, Confinement Officer, base agencies, local and AF level Inspector
General (IG), and civilian agencies to name a few. The correctional facility does not have the
right to quell any complaint before the necessary attention is given to the inmate’s complaint. If
an inmate wants to lodge a complaint, regardless of the legitimacy, the inmate will complete a
DD Form 510 and forward it to the on-duty UKCF staff member for action. The inmate will be
advised of the progress of his complaint as it is forwarded to the appropriate agency that will
handle the complaint. The person or agency that the inmate has requested to see will schedule a
date and time to listen to the inmate.
35. Punishable Conduct. While confined at military confinement/corrections facilities, all
inmates are subject to disciplinary action for violations of the UCMJ, relevant federal laws and
institutional rules, even after discharge from the service. This jurisdiction over an inmate
continues even after departing a military confinement/corrections facility (i.e., parole or excess
LAKENHEATHI31-107 5 JULY 2012                                                                    25


leave), as long as the inmate remains under the administrative control of the Air Force
Corrections System or the armed services. Misconduct is dealt with through trial by courts-
martial, charges brought before a Discipline and Adjustment Board (D&A Board) see paragraph
8.8.3. and other management or administrative actions. Actions taken as a result of a D&A
Board do not preclude punishment under the UCMJ.
36. Instruction Clarification. Any inmate/detainee having questions or requiring clarification
with regard to any item in this instruction, or seeking guidance on any matter of required
standards that is not addressed in this instruction, will request clarification from the Confinement
Officer, NCOIC, UK Corrections or on-duty Confinement Guard.
