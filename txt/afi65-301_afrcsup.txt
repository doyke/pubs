prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of
Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS)

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision deletes the requirement for management comments to be coordinated with NAF and HQ
AFRC before release to Air Force Audit Agency (AFAA) (Paragraph 1.5).

1.1. Overview. AFRC Audit Focal Point (AFP). The Comptroller and Director, Financial
Management (AFRC/FM) is the central AFP within AFRC for all matters relating to AFAA. The
Chief, Comptroller Plans Division (AFRC/FMX), acts for AFRC/FM in this regard. The AFP for
each Numbered Air Force (NAF) and Air Reserve Personnel Center (ARPC) is within the financial
management organization. AFRC units establish an audit focal point, preferably within the financial
management organization, to monitor audit activities for the commander. AFRC unit AFP must keep
the commander, NAF/FM, and HQ AFRC AFP informed of audit activities.

1.5. Management Comments. AFRC unit AFP e-mails applicable NAF/FM and HQ AFRC AFP
(afrc.auditfocal@afrc.af.mil) the management comments at the same time comments are released to
AFAA.
