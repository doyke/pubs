        extinguishing systems and other facilities that have clean agent fire suppression systems.
        Supervisors shall provide the training and maintain documentation. Fire department
        personnel are available to host this training, upon request.
     6.2. Fire Prevention Visit Process:
        6.2.1. Scheduled fire prevention visits will be conducted annually or more often,
        depending on the occupancy and the hazard classification of the facility or area.
51FWI32-2001 23 DECEMBER 2013                                                                  9


     6.2.2. Walk-through visits will be conducted on a no-notice basis and when increased
     activity or special operations indicate a need for increased fire safety. Walk-through
     inspections may include late evening visits (after normal duty hours) and may include
     firefighter familiarization visits.
     6.2.3. Visits for follow-up inspections to ensure previously identified fire hazards and
     deficiencies have been adequately eliminated/mitigated shall be carried out on a no-
     notice basis.
     6.2.4. The facility manager or his/her designated alternate will accompany the fire
     prevention inspector on all visits. He/she will provide access to all areas of the facility
     IAW Paragraph 5.3.
     6.2.5. Fire safety hazards/deficiencies noted during the inspection will be Corrected On
     the Spot (COS), if possible. Hazards that cannot be COS shall be immediately reduced to
     an acceptable level of safety and corrected as soon as possible. If a hazard or condition
     poses an imminent danger, prompt action will be taken to eliminate or reduce the danger.
     When the hazard involves an operation or process that must be stopped and action is not
     taken to do so, the fire chief, fire marshal, wing safety officer and the functional manager
     will be notified to observe and resolve the hazardous condition. If the problem cannot be
     resolved, ensure cordon or other control measures are established to prevent exposure or
     equipment to the hazard. The Fire Chief will coordinate with 51 FW/SE and notify the
     51 MSG/CC. The 51 MSG/CC will notify the 51 FW/CC, to include recommendation of
     OPREP-3 or CCIR, if warranted.
     6.2.6. Any fire safety deficiency or hazard that cannot be COS shall follow the guidance
     in Paragraph 4.
     6.2.7. An AF Form 1487 shall be used to annotate fire hazards and deficiencies that
     cannot be COS.
        6.2.7.1. The fire inspector will provide the facility manager a copy of the AF Form
        1487 and will explain the hazards identified on the report and discuss
        recommendations for corrective action(s).
        6.2.7.2. The facility manager must indicate the corrective action taken on the reverse
        side of the report, have the unit commander or functional manager (not the facility
        manager) review, sign, and date the report.
        6.2.7.3. The facility and functional manager shall ensure the completed report is
        returned to CEFP by the annotated suspense date.
            6.2.7.3.1. In the event that an AF Form 1487 is not returned by the suspense date,
            CEFP will forward all relevant documents to the appropriate commander. If
            continued delinquency occurs, the Fire Marshal and/or appropriate group level
            commander will be notified.
        6.2.7.4. When an AF Form 332 is submitted in order to correct a deficiency/hazard
        identified during an inspection the facility manager shall annotate, in the corrective
        actions section, that an AF Form 332 has been submitted and annotate the work
        request number.
  6.3. Fire/Emergency Action Procedures:
10                                                      51FWI32-2001 23 DECEMBER 2013


     6.3.1. When there is a fire in any building, immediate action must be taken to evacuate
     personnel, notify the fire department, and try to limit the spread of the fire. All personnel
     must be familiar with fire exits, fire alarm activation, fire suppression system activation if
     applicable, and emergency notification procedures. Employees should know primary and
     secondary escape routes for every area of the building. A rally point no closer than 200
     feet from the building being evacuated will be established for all personnel evacuating
     the building. For buildings/areas containing explosives refer to AFMAN 91-201,
     Explosives Safety Standards.
     6.3.2. The “SPEED” system should be used during fire emergencies. “SPEED” utilizes
     the following sequence of actions:
        6.3.2.1. -S--Sound the Alarm. Upon detecting fire, sound the alarm by either
        verbal and/or mechanical means to initiate evacuation.
            6.3.2.1.1. In buildings equipped with fire alarm systems, activate the nearest fire
            alarm pull station and verbally notify facility occupants by yelling, “Fire, fire,
            fire; evacuate the building.”
            6.3.2.1.2. In buildings not equipped with fire alarm systems verbally yell “Fire,
            fire, fire; evacuate the building” throughout the facility and immediately call the
            fire department.
            6.3.2.1.3. Do not utilize fire alarm system to evacuate facilities for gas leaks,
            spills of flammable liquids, or bomb threats. Utilize runner system to inform
            occupants of what evacuation route must be taken to avoid the hazard, e.g.,
            “There is a gas leak reported on the south side of the building. Use the north exit
            to evacuate the facility.”
        6.3.2.2. -P--Phone the Fire Department. Dial 911 from an on base land line phone
        or 0505-784-9111 from a cell or off base phone to reach base fire department and
        provide the following information: Location of the fire, building number, and your
        name and grade and phone number. Remain on the telephone until told to hang up.
        Make the phone call from a fire safe area. Do not assume that the fire department
        will respond if the facility fire alarm system is sounding and do not assume that
        someone will make the call.
            6.3.2.2.1. Any person discovering a fire, potential fire, or evidence of a fire must
            report it immediately to the FES flight. This includes any fire that has burned
            itself out or has been extinguished.
        6.3.2.3. -E--Ensure Evacuation. Evacuate the facility in a prompt but orderly
        fashion. DO NOT use elevators during evacuation; use the stairs to evacuate to
        ground level.
            6.3.2.3.1. Personnel will immediately leave the building and report to a
            predetermined rally location at least 200 feet from the involved facility.
            6.3.2.3.2. At the rally point, the senior supervisor will determine if there are any
            personnel missing. Personnel not accounted for will be reported to the Senior Fire
            Official (SFO). All personnel will remain at the rally point until released by the
            SFO.
51FWI32-2001 23 DECEMBER 2013                                                                 11


         6.3.2.4. -E--Extinguish if Possible. For small fires, an attempt to fight the fire may
         be made with available fire extinguishers if no other hazards are present and the
         personnel have been adequately trained on using the fire fighting equipment.
             6.3.2.4.1. Fighting fire with an extinguisher is inherently dangerous. Do not
             endanger yourself or others. If the fire is uncontrollable, abandon fire fighting
             efforts and evacuate the building.
         6.3.2.5. -D--Direct the Fire Department. Direct emergency response personnel to
         the fire and brief them of the situation.
  6.4. Fire Lanes/Restricted Parking:
     6.4.1. Restricted parking areas around buildings are identified and no parking is allowed
     in these areas.
     6.4.2. Do not park vehicles or trailers or store equipment in any manner that would
     impede access of firefighting equipment to all sides of buildings, in fire lanes, or within
     15 feet of a fire hydrant.
         6.4.2.1. Emergency vehicle access shall be maintained during all exercises/real world
         conditions. Barricades, wire, sand bags, etc. shall not prevent fire department
         emergency access to buildings.
  6.5. Fire Hydrants, Post Indicator Valves (PIV) and Fire Department Connections (FDC):
     6.5.1. Fire hydrants, PIV, and FDC must remain clear of all obstructions that might
     impede on their use during emergency situations. Areas around hydrants, PIV, and FDC,
     therefore, shall remain clear of all obstructions (vehicles, equipment, trailers, tugs, toe-
     bars, pallets, etc.). A minimum of 15 feet of clear space circling the device is required.
     6.5.2. Items such as trees, bushes, shrubs, signs, fences, trash cans or any other obstacles
     shall not obstruct or conceal a fire hydrant, PIV, or FDC at any time.
     6.5.3. Water mains and fire hydrants will not be shut off, nor maintenance performed
     that could interfere with the fire protection water supply without prior notification to the
     FACC.
     6.5.4. AFI 32-2001 requires the fire chief (designated representative) to receive hydrant
     flow test reports annually. Test results are maintained on AF Form 1027, Water Flow
     Test Record, or data automated product. Hydrant flow testing shall be performed IAW
     NFPA 291, Recommended Practice for Fire Flow Testing and Marking of Hydrants, and
     UFC 3-600-02.
     6.5.5. The 51 CES infrastructure/support will notify the Osan AB FES flight of proposed
     water curtailments which may affect fire protection water. They shall also identify
     inactive and defective fire hydrants by placing the appropriate “OUT OF SERVICE”
     placard on the fire hydrant.
     6.5.6. Out-of-Service Fire Hydrants/Water Distribution System: All personnel shall
     notify the FACC prior to beginning work for any scheduled system/hydrant outage that
     may adversely affect emergency response. Provide date and time outage will occur,
     location, and estimated time back in service. This includes any project (i.e., road
     blockage) that will render hydrants out-of-service due to inability to access hydrant.
12                                                      51FWI32-2001 23 DECEMBER 2013


     6.5.7. Out-of-service fire hydrants will be identified with an “OUT OF SERVICE”
     marker no smaller than 12 inches in diameter with weather proof white letters on a red
     background. Repairs should not exceed 3 working days. 51 CES/CEO shall update the
     FACC on changes in status on all outages and upon returning outage back in-service.
  6.6. Fire Extinguishers: CEFP shall determine the type, number, distribution, and placement
  of portable fire extinguishers as outlined in AFI 91-203, NFPA 101®, Life Safety Code,
  NFPA 10, Standard for Portable Fire Extinguishers, and AFMAN 91-201. Facility
  managers and using organizations are responsible for the purchase and maintenance of
  portable fire extinguishers. Prior to purchase of portable fire extinguishers, organizations
  must coordinate with CEFP for their approval to ensure the proper type and size of
  extinguisher is purchased.
     6.6.1. General Fire Extinguisher Requirements:
         6.6.1.1. Fire extinguishers will not be blocked or obstructed and shall remain readily
         accessible at all times. Directional arrows marking the location of fire extinguishers
         will be posted when extinguishers cannot be seen clearly in warehouses, industrial
         activities, and facilities where the volume of storage impairs or prohibits extinguisher
         visibility.
         6.6.1.2. Fire extinguishers shall not be located on vehicles, equipment, or in facilities,
         unless required by directive (e.g., purchase description, technical orders, AFIs, NFPA
         101®) or approved by the fire protection authority.
         6.6.1.3. Fire extinguishers will be permanently mounted on walls using approved
         brackets or in approved fire extinguisher cabinets. Recessed or semi-recessed fire
         extinguisher cabinets shall be included for all new construction and renovation
         projects.
         6.6.1.4. Fire extinguishers will not be used as doorstops, repositioned, or removed
         from their designated location without the approval of CEFP.
     6.6.2. Fire Extinguisher Purchase and Maintenance: Facility managers and using
     organizations must budget for the purchase/procurement and maintenance of portable fire
     extinguishers. This includes, but is not limited to, facility extinguishers, vehicle
     extinguishers, and aircraft or other special purpose extinguishers. Extinguishers are not
     required for MFH, but if provided (e.g. occupant, contractor), extinguishers must be
     serviceable and properly maintained.
         6.6.2.1. The facility manager or using organization manager is responsible for
         ensuring maintenance and testing of fire extinguishers. This includes emergency
         repair/maintenance, 6-year maintenance, and 12-year hydrostatic testing requirements
         as outlined in NFPA 10. It is generally more cost effective to replace the extinguisher
         instead of conducting the 12 year hydrostatic test. It may be necessary to replace the
         extinguisher at the 6 year mark if certified and qualified service technicians are not
         available to perform the 6 year maintenance.
         6.6.2.2. The using organization is responsible for transporting extinguishers to their
         servicing location.
     6.6.3. Minimum facility extinguisher ratings and travel distances are as follows:
51FWI32-2001 23 DECEMBER 2013                                                               13


        6.6.3.1. Light Occupancy Hazard – minimum rating of 2-A:10-B:C; maximum travel
        distance is 50 feet.
        6.6.3.2. Ordinary Hazard Occupancy – minimum rating of 2-A:20-B:C; maximum
        travel distance is 50 feet.
        6.6.3.3. Extra Hazard Occupancy – minimum rating of 4-A:40-B:C; maximum travel
        distance is 30 feet.
        6.6.3.4. Class K extinguisher for commercial cooking operations; maximum travel
        distance is 30 feet.
     6.6.4. Aircraft extinguishers are considered a piece of equipment for the platform it’s
     serving and must conform to the technical order requirements. There are programs in
     place through aircraft maintenance channels to assure adequate maintenance, repair, and
     replacement of unserviceable aircraft fire extinguishers.
     6.6.5. Visual Inspection: Managers and supervisors at all levels shall ensure a visual
     inspection is performed monthly and documented for all fire extinguishers under their
     control. Extinguishers with discrepancies will be taken to the designated servicing
     location or replaced. This inspection includes:
        6.6.5.1. Extinguisher located in designated place.
        6.6.5.2. No obstruction to access or visibility.
        6.6.5.3. Operating instructions on name plate legible and facing outward.
        6.6.5.4. Safety seals and/or tamper indicators not broken or missing.
        6.6.5.5. No obvious physical damage, corrosion, leakage, or clogged nozzle.
        6.6.5.6. Pressure gauge reading or indicator in the operable range or position.
        6.6.5.7. Fullness determined by weighing or "hefting."
     6.6.6. Fire Extinguisher Records: Fire extinguishers will be inspected monthly and
     documented by the facility manager. Monthly extinguisher inspection records shall be
     affixed to each extinguisher. See Attachment 2, 51FW Form 25, Monthly Fire
     Extinguisher Inspection Record, for example monthly extinguisher inspection tag. It is
     the using organization/facility manager’s responsibility to maintain an appropriate fire
     extinguisher maintenance/inspection program to include a method of tracking to ensure
     testing, maintenance, and/or replacement be executed before an extinguisher becomes
     unserviceable. See Attachment 3, 51FW Form 26, Fire Extinguisher Checklist and
     Inventory, for an example tracking sheet.
     6.6.7. Explosive Licensed Facilities: See Paragraph 8. Licensed facilities shall maintain
     a minimum of one or more portable fire extinguishers with a capacity rating of at least 2-
     A:20-B:C. when storing 1.2 explosives; for facilities storing 1.3 and higher explosives, a
     minimum of 2-A:10BC extinguisher is required.
     6.6.8. Commercial Cooking Facilities: Shall maintain at least 1 Class K-rated
     extinguisher within 30 feet of each cooking appliance utilizing vegetable oils and/or
     animal fats as a cooking medium. See Paragraph 9.2.8.
14                                                       51FWI32-2001 23 DECEMBER 2013


     6.6.9. 150 pound Halon 1211 Flightline Fire Extinguishers: AFI 32-7086, Hazardous
     Materials Management, governs the Halon management program. USAF and DoD has
     placed tight restrictions on the use of Halon in part because it is an Ozone-Depleting
     Substance (ODS). Halon cannot be used for anything other than the protection of
     aircraft. Controlled accountability of Halon inventory and detailed tracking of
     atmospheric releases are part of the ODS requirements.
         6.6.9.1. All 150 pound Halon flightline extinguishers are assigned to Osan AB FES
         flight’s Customer Account/Customer Requirements Listing (CA/CRL).                   No
         extinguisher shall be used for anything other than its intended purpose. All in-service
         flightline extinguishers are either on the airfield or in the ready line located on the
         airfield side of the fire department (bldg. 671).
         6.6.9.2. 150 pound flightline fire extinguishers will be used only for Osan AB
         mission critical areas. They will not be taken off the airfield for any reason without
         prior approval from the Fire Chief.
         6.6.9.3. If a flightline extinguisher requires servicing, the using organization will
         bring the extinguisher to the airfield side of the fire department, building 671, to the
         out-of-service line. A new extinguisher can be picked up from the ready line.
         6.6.9.4. Using organizations are responsible for moving flightline fire extinguishers
         within their work or ramp area to meet required coverage during maintenance and
         aircraft engine starts as outlined in T.O. 00-25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and
         Static Grounding/Bonding. Returning flight line extinguishers to the ready line that
         are not being used may be helpful to other mission requirements.
         6.6.9.5. Using organizations shall notify the FES flight immediately upon any and all
         releases of Halon, whether intentional, accidental, or caused by malfunction of the
         cylinder/valves.
  6.7. Fire Evacuation Drills: Emergency evacuation drills shall be held with sufficient
  frequency to familiarize occupants with the drill procedure and to establish conduct of the
  drill as a matter of routine. Drills shall include suitable procedures to ensure all persons
  subject to the drill participate. Fire evacuation drills are the responsibility of the functional
  manager, facility manager, and supervisors to ensure the safe evacuation of personnel in case
  of fire. Fire alarm systems will not be used to conduct fire evacuation drills without prior
  coordination with the FES flight.
     6.7.1. During fire evacuation drills, occupants will evacuate to a safe distance, away
     from the facility, and in a timely and orderly fashion. See Paragraph 6.3.
     6.7.2. Drill participants shall relocate to a predetermined location and remain at such
     location until a recall or dismissal signal is given. A roll shall be taken to ensure
     everyone is accounted for.
     6.7.3. A written record of each drill shall be completed by the person responsible for
     conducting the drill and maintained by that unit in an approved manner.
     6.7.4. If utilization of the fire alarm systems is desired, the facility manager will
     coordinate with CEFP.
     6.7.5. Fire evacuation drills will be held as listed below:
51FWI32-2001 23 DECEMBER 2013                                                                   15

     indicated.
  6.8. Exits, Exit Signs, And Emergency Lighting:
     6.8.1. Egress, egress access, egress discharge, number of means of egress, and egress
     components capacity and arrangement shall be IAW NFPA 101®.
     6.8.2. Exit doors will remain unlocked and unobstructed at all times the facility is
     occupied.
     6.8.3. Do not chain, bolt, or otherwise lock exit doors for exercises or escalation of force
     protection conditions. All exits shall remain readily accessible and clear of all
     obstructions when the facility is occupied by one or more persons. Post sentries to
     monitor ingress, but DO NOT condone procedures that inhibit or impede egress. Exit
     hardware that prohibits ingress but does not hinder egress is available IAW NFPA 101®.
     6.8.4. Exit doors must swing in the direction of egress when the facility/area is occupied
     by 50 or more people.
     6.8.5. Any door that is neither an exit nor a means of exit access and that is located or
     arranged so it can be mistaken for an exit shall be identified with a sign stating “NOT
