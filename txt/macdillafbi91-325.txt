     initiated the permit to determine potential problems with confined spaces.
5. Pre-Entry Confined Space Evaluation. Entry supervisors must plan in order to make
successful confined space entries. Supervisors must consider the following before allowing
personnel to enter confined spaces:
     5.1. Determine if any solvents will be taken into the space.
     5.2. Determine if any of the solvents have a low flash point.
     5.3. Determine if the use of solvents necessitates the use of forced air ventilation. BES
     should be consulted when determining if forced air ventilation will be used and how long the
     unit must be run before entry.
     5.4. If forced air ventilation is used, determine how the unit and its ducting must be placed to
     get adequate breathable air to entrants.
     5.5. Review Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) on the chemicals that will be used in the
     space. BES shall be notified of all products used in the confined space. BES will
     recommend appropriate controls. Note: MSDSs do not always adequately address the
     hazards of the product, especially when used in a confined space.
     5.6. Determine if conditions outside of the space may affect entrants inside.
     5.7. Determine if non-sparking tools will need to be taken into the space.
     5.8. Determine the number of personnel that will be in the space at a time.
     5.9. Determine the primary function of the confined space, i.e., storage tank, hopper, pit, etc.
     5.10. Heavy motor vehicle traffic around the space that could generate carbon monoxide.
     5.11. Chemical residues located on the walls and floor of the confined space that can liberate
     gases and vapors as the result of work processes in the space.
6. Atmospheric Monitoring.
     6.1. Monitoring shall be done according to the permit-required or the MEP. Monitoring of
     the atmosphere in a permit-required confined space shall be done prior to each entry as
     indicated in paragraph 7.2. below. Continuous monitoring during the entry must be
     performed.
        6.1.1. Organizations that routinely enter confined spaces shall procure appropriate
        monitoring equipment. BES must approve all monitoring equipment before purchasing.

     6.1.2. Organizations that enter confined spaces on an infrequent basis may request BES
     to complete required testing. BES equipment will not be loaned.
     6.1.3. The individual who will be using the monitoring equipment shall be trained by
     BES in the operation and limitations of the monitoring equipment. This is required
     whether the organization owns the equipment or the equipment is borrowed.
  6.2. At a minimum, confined spaces must be monitored for oxygen, flammability, and
  toxicity levels. Certain situations may also require monitoring for other constituents. These
  tests can be performed by the organization provided that they have the appropriate equipment
  and training. This monitoring is conducted by Bioenvironmental Engineering or the
  organization.
     6.2.1. Frequency of monitoring will be determined by CSPT team and addressed on
     master entry plan.
         6.2.1.1. If the atmosphere contains less than 19.5 percent oxygen, it is considered
         oxygen deficient and personnel are not allowed to enter the space. Personnel may
         only enter the space if the oxygen content is at 19.5 percent or greater. When
         atmospheric concentrations decrease below 20.6 percent oxygen, further evaluation
         may be necessary if the source of contamination is not known.
         6.2.1.2. Oxygen Enriched Atmospheres: If the atmosphere contains more than 23.5
         percent oxygen, it is considered an oxygen enriched atmosphere. These atmospheres
         make the conditions right for flash fires and personnel are not allowed to enter the
         space. When atmospheric concentrations of oxygen increase above 21 percent,
         further evaluation may be necessary if the source of the additional oxygen is not
         known.
     6.2.2. Flammability Monitoring: This monitoring shall be measured before entry into
     confined spaces. Continuous monitoring must be conducted during the entire operation.
         6.2.2.1. Lower Explosive Limit (LEL): Individuals should not enter the space if
         monitoring indicates levels at or greater than 4 percent of the LEL without
         investigating the cause of the higher readings. Atmospheres that are less than 10
         percent of the LEL are too lean to burn. Nevertheless, when a space contains or
         produces measurable LEL readings below 10 percent, it might indicate that
         flammable vapors are being introduced or released in the space and could present a
         hazard in time. Therefore, the cause of the vapors must be investigated and, if
         possible, eliminated prior to entry.
         6.2.2.2. Meters that measure LEL are calibrated using a specific gas. The LEL
         reading must be corrected for the hazard present in the confined space prior to
         interpreting the reading, unless the calibration gas is the same as the gas present. The
         operating manual of the instrument shall be consulted to determine how to perform
         this correction.
     6.2.3. Monitoring for Certain Gases: Certain gases may be present in the confined space,
     depending on the situation. Many ―confined space meters‖ have the capability of
     monitoring for these gases. If it is necessary to monitor for these gases, it will be
     indicated on the permit. BES shall determine if monitoring is necessary for these gases.

         6.2.3.1. Hydrogen Sulfide Levels: The space must be tested for hydrogen sulfide
         levels. Hydrogen sulfide is a colorless gas that smells like rotten eggs and can disable
         entrants in seconds. Hydrogen sulfide is present in confined spaces from naturally
         occurring chemical reactions.
         6.2.3.2. Sulfur Dioxide Levels: This gas also occurs in confined spaces from
         naturally occurring chemical reactions. Sulfur dioxide is also generated by the
         burning of hydrogen sulfide as in welding operations.
     6.2.4. Carbon Monoxide: Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas which is a
     byproduct of incomplete combustion of fuel. Anytime a generator or other source of
     carbon monoxide is present, monitoring for the gas shall be performed.
     6.2.5. Toxicity Monitoring: There are many chemicals that may be present in confined
     spaces that were either present prior to entry or were brought in as part of the job. BES
     or the unit performs monitoring for toxicity. In most cases, this type of monitoring is
     more complex than other confined space monitoring and requires specialized equipment.
     BES must be contacted for more details.
  6.3. Monitoring Procedures. General requirements.
     6.3.1. The atmosphere of a confined space must be monitored according to strict
     procedures. If not, the readings may be inaccurate and the safety of entrants may be
     jeopardized.
     6.3.2. Atmospheric readings are only valid for one 8-hour shift.
     6.3.3. The atmosphere of the confined space will be re-tested after extensive breaks in
     the work process. For example, shift change, extensive breaks, and after lunch.
     6.3.4. Monitoring will be done continuously while entrants are inside the confined space.
     6.3.5. The continuous monitoring will be performed at the point of work operation.
     6.3.6. Before any testing begins, the person using the instrument must be trained by BES.
  6.4. The following procedure should be followed when monitoring confined spaces:
     6.4.1. Test the air in a 5-foot area around the space for explosive gases and vapors.
     6.4.2. Open the entry way to the space, but do not open it completely. Test the air
     around the opening of the space. Insert the hose a few feet into the space and monitor the
     atmosphere again. If the levels are safe, open the space completely and begin monitoring
     the inside of the space.
     6.4.3. The space must be tested in the following sequence:
         6.4.3.1. Test your oxygen levels first; next,
         6.4.3.2. Test for the LEL; next,
         6.4.3.3. Test for other gases as indicated on the MEP and/or the confined space entry
         permit.
         6.4.3.4. Toxicity monitoring will be conducted by BES or the unit.
     6.4.4. For vertical spaces, the following procedure must be followed:
MACDILLAFBI91-325 26 AUGUST 2010                                                                11


          6.4.4.1. Follow paragraphs 6.4.1. to 6.4.3.4.
          6.4.4.2. Lower the hose into the space until it is 1 foot from the top and begin
          monitoring.
          6.4.4.3. After the readings are complete, lower the hose 3 feet from the top and again
          begin monitoring. Monitoring must be done every 3 feet until the hose reaches the
          bottom of the space.
          6.4.4.4. For every foot of hose, you should monitor at each level for 10 seconds. For
          example, if a monitor has a 10-foot hose, the operator should keep the hose at each 3-
          foot level for 100 seconds or 1.25 minutes.
       6.4.5. For horizontal spaces:
          6.4.5.1. Follow paragraphs 6.4.1. to 6.4.3.4. If readings are acceptable for entry,
          enter the space.
          6.4.5.2. Utilize a probe on the end of the monitor to test the air in front of you.
          6.4.5.3. The atmosphere in front of the entrant will be tested in 2-foot increments.
          The probe will be held at each level for 10 seconds for every foot of hose.
          6.4.5.4. The atmosphere must be tested until the entrant reaches the location inside
          the space where work will be performed.
   6.5. Atmospheric Monitoring and Ventilation:
       6.5.1. The space must be retested if ventilation equipment is used.
       6.5.2. Test the space while the ventilation equipment is running. Test the dead air spaces
       around the ventilation stream. Note: Ventilating a confined space may place its
       atmosphere in an explosive state. Also, atmospheric readings may be inaccurate if the
       space is tested while ventilating equipment is operating as personnel make the mistake of
       only testing the clean air stream produced by the ventilation equipment.
7. Evaluate The Space To Determine If An Engulfment Hazard Is Present.
   7.1. Engulfment hazards exist when a confined space entrant can be surrounded and captured
   by a liquid or finely divided solid.
   7.2. Engulfment kills confined space entrants because they breathe a liquid or finely divided
   solid into their lungs. As a result, the lungs become filled and plugged with the liquid or
   finely divided solid. Engulfment can also exert enough force on the body to cause death by
   strangulation, constriction, and crushing.
   7.3. Examples of confined spaces that can cause engulfment include saw dust bins and
   spaces that contain water.
   7.4. Engulfment hazards must be minimized through the use of life lines and retrieval
   systems.
8. Evaluate The Space To Determine If It Has An Internal Configuration That Could Trap
Entrants. These spaces have areas that taper into small cross sections. Entrants become trapped
in these small areas and their chest cannot expand because it is compressed.
 12                                                  MACDILLAFBI91-325 26 AUGUST 2010


   8.1. If hazards may be introduced into the confined space due to "hot work," contact BES to
   evaluate the potential hazards and recommend ventilation procedures.
9. Evaluate The Space To Determine If It Has Other Recognized Safety and Health
Hazards. Examples of recognized safety and health hazards include, but are not limited to, the
following:
   9.1. Slippery floors.
   9.2. Electrical hazards.
   9.3. Burn hazards from hot water pipes.
   9.4. Biological hazards.
   9.5. Heat extremes that can cause heat stroke/heat stress.
   9.6. Fall hazards.
10. Entry Into Permit-Required Confined Spaces.
   10.1. These spaces contain atmospheres or conditions that are hazardous but not
   Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health (IDLH).
   10.2. An entry permit approved by 6 AMW/SEG, 6 CES/CEF, and 6 AMDS/SGPB or an
   entry permit issued by an entry supervisor in accordance with the organizational MEP is
   required for entry.
   10.3. Where contaminations are caused by materials or conditions within the space, the entry
   supervisor will identify sources and remove it to the maximum degree possible.
   10.4. Operations creating hazards will be covered by the permit, and actions will be taken to
   minimize and control the hazards.
   10.5. When toxic materials are or may be introduced into the space, the entry supervisor
   shall ensure proper respiratory protective devices are available and worn, when necessary, by
   workers.
   10.6. Only explosion proof or intrinsically safe equipment is used where flammable or
   explosive atmospheres are present.
   10.7. Entrants into a permit area will wear approved harnesses and lifelines that permit
   extraction. The lifeline will be attached to a fixed point outside the space. The lifeline will
   not be attached to vehicles or mobile equipment.
   10.8. Entry supervisors will notify the base fire department’s alarm control center that a
   permit-required confined space entry is in progress. Entrants must leave the space if rescue
   personnel must respond to an emergency unless the unit has its own rescue team on site.
   10.9. Ensure an attendant is present for all permit entries.
   10.10. If atmospheric conditions require, ventilation will be utilized to remove contaminants
   and provide air. Note: Ventilation should run continuously even when workers exit the
   space for breaks.
   10.11. Atmospheric monitoring shall be continuous throughout entry to ensure that
   conditions do not become IDLH.
MACDILLAFBI91-325 26 AUGUST 2010                                                                13


   10.12. The space shall be barricaded to prevent vehicles and pedestrians from interfering
   with entries.
11. Reclassification of Confined Spaces.
   11.1. An entry supervisor may reclassify a permit-required space as non-permit if approved
   by CSPT and it meets the following:
       11.1.1. Atmospheric testing shows the space is free of hazards. Note: Testing must be
       done outside of the space. If entry must be made to test the space, a permit is required for
       entry.
       11.1.2. Actual or potential hazards are eliminated, and continuous monitoring is used to
       ensure that the atmosphere remains free of hazards.
       11.1.3. During routine work, the entrant does not take tools or material into the space
       that could introduce a hazard.
       11.1.4. The entrant does not perform any work that would cause a hazardous condition.
       11.1.5. If conditions in the space become hazardous, the entry supervisor must evacuate
       and secure the space until an approved permit can be issued.
12. Entry Into Permit Required Spaces That Are IDLH.
   12.1. The CSPT will authorize entry and work in IDLH spaces.
   12.2. All permit required confined spaces on MacDill AFB must be tested and evaluated by
   entry supervisors prior to any confined space entry to determine if the space is a permit-
   required confined space. This evaluation is only valid for one 8-hour workshift.
   12.3. The following conditions must be met for entry into IDLH atmospheres:
       12.3.1. Efforts are made to reduce the hazard by isolation, ventilation, purging, inserting,
       or other techniques. If efforts are unsuccessful, entry is only authorized in cases of
       EXTREME EMERGENCY.
       12.3.2. The entry permit must be approved by the CSPT prior to entry.
       12.3.3. Workers entering the space shall wear a positive pressure self-contained
       breathing apparatus or airline respirator with a 20-minute escape bottle, harness, and
       lifeline. At no time will the Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) be taken off
       the back of the wearer while inside the space.
       12.3.4. Emergency rescue personnel, equipped for extraction of workers, are stationed
       immediately outside of the space. Entrants must be removed from the space if rescue
       personnel must leave to respond to another emergency.
       12.3.5. Communication is maintained at all times with entrants.
       12.3.6. Only explosion proof or intrinsically safe equipment and non-sparking tools are
       used where flammable or explosive atmospheres are present.
       12.3.7. A qualified safety official, fire protection specialist, and Bioenvironmental
       representative are present at the time of entry.
 14                                                 MACDILLAFBI91-325 26 AUGUST 2010


13. Entry Into Non-Permit Spaces.
   13.1. Entry into a non-permit confined space will require documentation that atmospheric
   testing was accomplished and shows the readings present at time of testing. No further
   testing is required if testing results are within limits specified in other parts of this
   publication. However, if you introduce any hazardous materials, perform any operation, or
   change any condition, the space must be reevaluated by the CSPT. Entry is authorized
   without a permit only when absolutely nothing has changed from the time it was evaluated
   by the CSPT and current testing shows no changes from the CSPT evaluation.
   13.2. The space shall be barricaded to prevent vehicles and pedestrians from interfering with
   entries.
   13.3. Even though the space is non-permit, it may be appropriate for entrants to use fall
   protection, radio communications, and other measures used for permit required confined
   spaces.
14. Lockout/Tagout and The Control of Hazardous Energy (Warning Tag for Aircraft
Maintenance).
   14.1. All hazardous energy sources will be isolated and controlled prior to entry.
   14.2. The squadron’s lockout OI and/or written program will be used to the fullest extent
   possible to protect confined space entrants from release of energy sources.
   14.3. Consideration will be given to energy sources that exist in different forms to include:
      14.3.1. Electrical.
      14.3.2. Hydraulic.
      14.3.3. Water.
      14.3.4. Pneumatic.
      14.3.5. Mechanical.
      14.3.6. Springs.
      14.3.7. Radiation.
      14.3.8. Steam.
      14.3.9. Stored energy.
   14.4. Whenever possible, locks must be used instead of tags.
   14.5. Valve handles must be locked into place via a valve-locking device or padlock and
   chain.
15. Contractor Operations.
   15.1. When contractors are required to perform work in confined spaces, the base
   contracting office shall ensure:
      15.1.1. The contractor has a written confined space program that meets the requirements
      of 29 CFR 1910.146 and shows verifiable proof that the contract employees have
      undergone confined space training.
MACDILLAFBI91-325 26 AUGUST 2010                                                              15


      15.1.2. The contractor is informed that all confined spaces on MacDill AFB are
      considered permit-required confined spaces until tested and evaluated. Contractors may
      reclassify the space in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.146 (c)(7)(i).
      15.1.3. The contractor knows that the base fire department performs confined space
      rescues.
      15.1.4. The contractor knows the phone number to the base fire department and knows
      how to properly summon a confined space rescue.
      15.1.5. Rescue procedures have been established.
      15.1.6. The contractor is briefed on the contents of each confined space in which they
      will be working. This brief should be conducted by the contract inspector and the
      affected squadron’s safety representative.
      15.1.7. If the space does not belong to a particular squadron, contracting personnel must
      conduct the briefing with technical assistance from Safety, Fire Department, and
      Bioenvironmental Engineering. This briefing must include a description of the space’s
      hazards and the Air Force’s past experience with the space.
      15.1.8. At the end of the job, the contractor must conduct a debrief with a contract
      inspector to discuss the permit space program that was followed and hazards confronted
      or created during entry.
      15.1.9. When Air Force personnel work in confined spaces with contract employees,
      entry operations will be coordinated. When there is a conflict between Air Force entry
      procedures and contractor entry procedures, Contracting, Safety, Fire Department, and
      Bioenvironmental Engineering will determine the correct entry procedures.
   15.2. The 6 AMW/SEG reserves the right to terminate, at any time, any contractor confined
   space operations that place Air Force personnel or property in dangerous situations.
16. Communication (Permit Entry).
   16.1. Communication for confined space entries will take two forms. One form will be
   between the confined space entrant(s) and attendant. The other form of communication must
   be between the attendant and rescue personnel.
   16.2. Entrant and Attendant Communication:
      16.2.1. The entrant may communicate with the attendant visually and by voice if the
      entrant is in plain view and sight of the attendant. However, if the entrant must disappear
      around corners or excessive noise prohibits voice communication, radios must be used.
      16.2.2. Radio communication can take the form of hand-held radios or headsets. The
      radios that are taken into confined spaces must be intrinsically safe.
   16.3. Rescue Communication:
      16.3.1. Attendants must have a two-way radio or telephone/cellular phone capable of
      contacting the fire alarm communications center or a control center that can immediately
      contact the fire department in the event of an emergency.
 16                                                MACDILLAFBI91-325 26 AUGUST 2010


      16.3.2. Attendants are responsible for immediately calling the fire department in the
      event of an emergency.
      16.3.3. The fire department must contact the attendant to order the entrant out of the
      permit-required confined space in the event the fire department must respond to an
      emergency on or off base.
17. Rescues and Emergencies in Confined Spaces.
   17.1. MacDill AFB Confined Space Rescue Team.
      17.1.1. The MacDill AFB Fire Department will be responsible for all confined space
      rescue operations unless the unit has a trained rescue team on site.
      17.1.2. All rescue providers shall be First Aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)
      trained.
      17.1.3. Semiannually, the base Fire Department will simulate a variety of confined space
      rescues with mannequins to keep confined space rescue training current. Organizational
      rescue teams must conduct quarterly rescue training.
      17.1.4. The base Fire Department will conduct their own confined space rescue training.
   17.2. Confined Space Rescues-General Requirements.
      17.2.1. Attendants will at no time enter the confined space to attempt a rescue of
      personnel. Only non-entry rescues are allowed.
      17.2.2. Rescue providers shall be on site for IDLH permit entries and be readily available
      for all permit-required entries. At no time will a mechanically powered retrieval system,
      i.e., vehicle or winch, be used to retrieve entrants.
      17.2.3. Before entering permit-required confined spaces, entry supervisors and/or
      attendants will notify the fire department’s alarm control center of the:
         17.2.3.1. Location of space being entered.
         17.2.3.2. Type of space being entered.
         17.2.3.3. Type of work being performed in the space.
         17.2.3.4. Time contacted.
         17.2.3.5. Expected amount of time the permit entry will take.
         17.2.3.6. Name of the entry supervisor.
      17.2.4. Alarm control center personnel will maintain a log that noted the:
         17.2.4.1. Location of space being entered.
         17.2.4.2. Type of space being entered.
         17.2.4.3. Type of work being performed in the space.
         17.2.4.4. Time contacted.
         17.2.4.5. Expected amount of time the permit entry will take.
         17.2.4.6. Name of the entry supervisor.
MACDILLAFBI91-325 26 AUGUST 2010                                                                17


  17.3. Confined Space Emergencies:
     17.3.1. Attendants will notify the alarm control center of the location of the space on
     base and any special conditions associated with the emergency.
     17.3.2. The alarm control center will then notify ambulance personnel.
     17.3.3. Attendants must prepare for the arrival of the confined space rescue team by:
         17.3.3.1. Preparing to tell the on-scene commander details about the confined space.
         17.3.3.2. Attendant must keep unauthorized rescuers away from the space. After the
         fire department arrives, the attendant will be responsible for keeping unauthorized
         personnel away from the confined space.
         17.3.3.3. Informing the on-scene commander of the hazards associated with the
         confined space and the special conditions associated with the confined space. For
         instance, the space could have angled floors that are slippery or welding operations
         could have been going on inside the space before the emergency occurred.
  17.4. Non-entry rescue (Permit Entry):
     17.4.1. Ensure all entrants are trained to perform self-rescue.
     17.4.2. Entrants will wear a full body harness with a D-ring attached to a tripod and
     winch to facilitate non-entry rescue. The retrieval line will be attached at the center of
     the person’s back near shoulder level.
     17.4.3. Wristlets will not be used unless the employer can demonstrate that the use of a
     chest or full-body harness is infeasible or unsafe and that the use of wristlets is the safest
     and most effective alternative.
     17.4.4. A mechanical device will be available to retrieve personnel from vertical spaces
     more than 5-feet deep.
     17.4.5. The full body harness, tripod, and winch will not be used if the retrieval system
     would create a greater hazard for the entrant.
     17.4.6. Cases where the retrieval system would create a greater hazard for entrants
     include:
         17.4.6.1. The space contains obstructions or turns that prevent pull on the line from
         being transmitted to the entrant.
         17.4.6.2. The entrant could risk contact with projections in the space.
         17.4.6.3. An air-supplied respirator would put entrants at risk of airline entanglement
         with the retrieval line.
         17.4.6.4. Retrieval lines would become tangled with a large number of employees in
         the space at the same time.
     17.4.7. When a confined space emergency occurs:
         17.4.7.1. The attendant will call for fire and ambulance response.
         17.4.7.2. The attendant will immediately retrieve the entrant from the space by use of

          17.4.7.3. The attendant will assess the entrant’s condition. Note: The effects of
          electric shock and some chemical exposures are not immediately apparent. The
          individual must be examined by a competent medical authority after electric shock,
          severe falls, chemical overexposure, welding fume overexposure, and any other
          serious injury.
18. Welding, Cutting, and Brazing in Confined Spaces and Enclosed Areas.
   18.1. All confined space entries that require welding, cutting, riveting, and/or brazing will be
   permit-required confined space entries.
   18.2. AF Form 592, USAF Welding, Cutting, and Brazing Permit: Whenever workers
   perform hot riveting, welding, cutting, burning, or heating operations within a confined
   space, an AF Form 592 must be obtained from the base fire department.
   18.3. The welding permit will be maintained with its corresponding entry permit. The
   welding permit must be placed outside the space next to the confined space entry permit.
   18.4. Continuous forced air ventilation will be used while welding, cutting, riveting, and/or
   brazing in confined spaces. Note: Never use pure oxygen to ventilate confined spaces - -
   flash fire may result.
   18.5. If ventilation proves not to be feasible, an air line respirator with at least a 5-minute
   escape bottle or self- contained breathing apparatus will be used.
   18.6. The attendant will ensure proper airflow and proper function of airline units.
   18.7. All electrical leads will be inspected for nicks and cuts prior to entry. Any electrical
   leads that have substantial nicks and cuts will not be used inside the space.
   18.8. When arc welding is to be stopped for any substantial period of time, all electrodes
   shall be removed from the holders and the holders carefully located so that accidental contact
   cannot occur and the machine is disconnected from the power source.
   18.9. Gas cylinders will not be taken into any confined spaces (small propane cylinders are
   exempt when used in a maintenance operation).
   18.10. All hoses used for transferring gas and oxygen for welding, cutting, and burning
   purposes will be inspected before entering confined spaces and after welding is stopped for
   any substantial period of time, e.g., lunch breaks, overnight, etc.
   18.11. All welding hoses and torches will be removed from the confined space when
   welding is stopped for a substantial period of time, e.g., lunch, overnight.
   18.12. Welding equipment that is mounted on wheels will be chocked to prevent it from
   rolling.
   18.13. Torch valves must be closed and the fuel-gas and oxygen supply to the torch shut off
   at some point outside the confined space whenever the torch is not to be used for a
   substantial period of time.
   18.14. At no time will a mechanically powered retrieval system, i.e., vehicle or winch, be
   used to retrieve entrants.

19. Ventilation.
   19.1. BES shall approve any ventilation configuration. They also may provide assistance in
   determining ventilation requirements.
   19.2. Pre-planning. The positioning of ventilating equipment is crucial to ensure the
   confined space is being ventilated properly. The supervisor must truly understand the nature
   of the confined space in order to properly ventilate it. This can be accomplished by
   analyzing the following:
       19.2.1. Determine if you need to ground or bond the air blower unit. Blower units will
       generate static electricity. An arc from static electricity could cause an explosion in and
       around explosive atmospheres.
       19.2.2. Determine how large the space is in terms of volume.
       19.2.3. Determine the type of atmosphere you are trying to ventilate. For instance, the
       way you position your duct work depends on whether the contaminants are lighter or
       heavier than air.
       19.2.4. Determine if there is more than one opening into the space.
       19.2.5. Determine where the contaminated exhausted air will leave the space. At times,
       people have placed the intake for their air blower next to the exhaust portal for the
       confined space. In essence, contaminated air is recirculated back into the confined space.
       19.2.6. Determine the shape of the space. This influences the type of directional device
       and the amount of air pressure needed to ensure that the space can be adequately
       ventilated.
       19.2.7. Determine the clean air source. Do not place the intake in an area that contains
       contaminated air.
       19.2.8. Determine the length of time ventilation is needed. Ventilation may only be
       needed to purge the space or to provide continuous ventilation.
       19.2.9. Determine the type of work that will be performed in the space. If the work
       produces dust or fumes, local exhaust ventilation is better than general ventilation. If
       work will be done throughout the space, continuous general ventilation in combination
       with local exhaust ventilation may be needed to control the atmosphere.
   19.3. Improper Ventilating Techniques. Entry supervisors and attendants will ensure the
   following improper ventilating techniques do not occur.
       19.3.1. Recirculation of contaminated exhaust back into the space. This situation occurs
       when contaminated air is forced out of the space, the ventilation equipment captures the
       contaminated air, and blows it back into the space.
       19.3.2. Short Circuiting the Air Flow.
          19.3.2.1. Short circuiting occurs when fresh air moves directly from the inlet into the
          confined space and to the exhaust outlet without circulating through the other areas of
          the space.

          19.3.2.2. When this occurs, much of the space never gets ventilated because there is
          no airflow through it.
