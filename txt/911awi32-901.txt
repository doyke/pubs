This instruction implements AFPD 32-90, Real Property Management. It establishes Air Force policy for
standardized installation and maintenance of utility connections and related appurtenances for non-gov-
ernment owned appliances and equipment. It applies to all personnel living or working on this installa-
tion.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This is a revision of 911 TAGR 91-2, 1 March 1990. It updates references to Air Force Instructions and
streamlines previous guidance.



1. Scope. The provisions of this regulation apply to anyone requiring or desiring attachment or placement
of non-government owned equipment or appliances including operating parts and apparatus, to a govern-
ment owned structure or utility system on base property and includes appliances and equipment owned
and operated by concessionaires. Appliance and equipment are classified as either "normal household
appliances or equipment" or "other appliances and equipment".

2. Responsibility. The responsibility for assuring compliance with these procedures rests with the build-
ing manager or Officer in Charge (OIC), in the case of tenant organizations, and the Base Civil Engineer.
It is a requirement of Air Force instructions that prior approval is necessary to connect any non-govern-
ment owned appliance or equipment to any base utility system. Both the appliance and the connection
must be approved by the Base Civil engineer, except that normal portable appliances used for personal
care and comfort, such as electric shaver, hair dryers, radios and portable televisions sets, may be used in
Government quarters where connections are provided. Installation of any antennas or aerial system for
radios or televisions that require attachment to facilities or structures must be first approved by the Base
Civil Engineer.

3. Air Force Policy for Utility Connections:
    3.1. Normal Household Appliances and Equipment. Utility connections and other electrical fixed
    appurtenances are provided from available resources in government quarters to serve normal house-
    hold equipment and appliances. Utility connections not normally provided may be installed on a
    self-help basis in government quarters in accordance with AFI 32-9002 Use of Real Property Facili-
    ties and AFI 32-1031 Operations Management upon approval.
    3.2. Other Appliances and Equipment. The installation of circuits, panels, outlets, and other equip-
    ment and foundations for operating vending machines, appliances, or equipment not specifically
    authorized for military purposes or use, must be made by and at the expense of the individual respon-
    sible for the equipment.
    3.3. Only certified electricians may install or modify the facility fixed electrical wiring system.

4. Procedures - Normal Household Appliances:
    4.1. Regulations issued by the Wing Commander govern the installation of appliances and equip-
    ment. Normal privately owned household appliances and equipment that may be connected to gov-
    ernment owned utilities are listed in Attachment 1.
    4.2. Each installation will be accomplished by or under the supervision of the Base Civil engineer and
    must conform to the standard facility plan, the National Electric Code; AFI 32-1031, applicable pro-
    visions of AFI 32-1021 Planning and Programming of Facility Construction Projects and all safety
    and mechanical requirements.
    4.3. Required additional real property facility improvements will become the property of the govern-
    ment in place and accounted for according to AFI 32-9005, Real Property Accountability and Report-
    ing except items of equipment for which the occupant intends to retain possession or is required to
    remove upon termination of occupancy. The format for requesting permission to install a non-govern-
    ment owned appliance or piece of equipment will have an approval letter on hand and must ensure that
    the item is personally inspected by the Civil Engineering Electric Shop personnel prior to connection
    to an Air Force circuit.
    4.4. The occupants will bear the costs of installation and removal when:
       4.4.1. Utility connections are required solely for privately owned equipment substituted for ade-
       quate government owned equipment.
       4.4.2. Privately owned equipment is not included in Attachment 1 and the Base Commander
       determines that such improvements are for the benefit of the immediate occupant only.
    4.5. Base personnel will not normally be used for work to be paid for by the occupant. When
    required, the government will be reimbursed.
    4.6. The owner is responsible for maintenance and repair of privately owned equipment and appli-
    ances.

5. Guidance on Installation of Open type Heating Coil Equipment. The use of hot plates and similar
equipment that incorporates an open type heating coil is prohibited. The use of heating equipment with
open type heating coils will be permitted only if equipped with safety guards and thermostats, UL
