2. Semiannual Security Inspections:
    2.1. The commander/directorate will designate, in writing, personnel who will conduct semian-
    nual security inspections of the unit. Appointed individuals should have knowledge of Information
    Security Program requirements and must possess the appropriate security clearance and accesses
    required to effectively evaluate the unit’s program. Security Managers should not conduct self-inspec-
    tions themselves, but have others in the unit perform them.
    2.2. The inspection of each element of the security program, i.e., Information, Personnel, and
    Physical Security, may be made on the basis of random sampling; however, the inspection must
    be extensive enough to show compliance with security requirements. Sufficient classified docu-
    ments will be sampled to ensure they are properly marked and are not over-classified or classified
    unnecessarily. Inspection personnel will use the local unit security self-inspection checklist at Attach-
    ment 1.

    until all items are closed. After commander approves corrective actions, the security manager will file
    the report for one year in the security manager’s handbook.
AFISRAI31-401 25 JANUARY 2008                                                                              5


3. End-of-Day Security Checks:
   3.1. Classified material contained in open storage areas need not be placed in security contain-
   ers at the end of each work day; however, these materials must be organized. F i l e s y s t e m s ,
   bookcases, magnetic media storage containers, etc., should be used to store classified materials autho-
   rized for open storage. In closed storage areas all desk tops, file cabinets, book shelves, trash contain-
   ers, typewriters, copier machines, and data automation systems will be checked for the presence of
   classified material. All classified material contained in closed storage areas will be collected and
   placed in approved GSA security containers.
   3.2. The individual locking the vault or container will enter the time the container was locked
   and initial the “Closed By” column of the Standard Form (SF) 702, Security Container Check
   Sheet. In the absence of a second individual, the same person locking the container may also ver-
   ify the locking action.
   3.3. Following the check and completion of the SF 702, the individual conducting the end-of-day
   check will use the SF 701, “Activity Security Checklist,” as an inspection checklist. SF 702 is not
   utilized to secure individual rooms. Each item listed on the SF 701 will be checked and the findings
   documented. An entry is not required on the SF 701 on non-duty days such as weekends or holidays.
   SF 701s and SF 702s will be maintained for 90 days after completion.
   3.4. If an area is alarmed (i.e. vaults and work areas), the individual conducting the end-of-day
   check will ensure alarms are secured.
   3.5. The SF 700, "Security Container Information," will be used for security containers and
   doors secured with mechanical pushbutton locks. Part I will be posted inside the container door/
   drawer where the locking mechanism is located so that if the container is found unsecured, Part I will
   be easily found. If part II contains mechanical pushbutton lock combinations, it will be maintained at
   the Information Operations Center (IOC). Contact portions of the SF 700, Part I and II will be kept up
   to date. The combination on part II of the SF 700 will also be kept current. If part II contains security
   container combinations, it will be protected at the level of the information stored in the container.
   3.6. The SF 700 will be updated as necessary.

4. Protection of Classified Material:
   4.1. Marking. Classified documents will be marked in accordance with Executive Order 12958.
   A marking guide is available on JWICS by accessing the Security Office homepage and accessing
   products and services.
   4.2. Document Handling. Classified documents removed from security containers will be kept
   under constant surveillance in non-SCIF areas. Use the appropriate cover sheet (see below) when clas-
   sified material is left unattended or transported within a SCIF.
   SF Form 704, Secret Cover Sheet
   SF Form 705, Confidential Cover Sheet
   AF Form 144; Top Secret Access Record and Cover Sheet
   AFSRA Form 2, NATO SECRET Cover Sheet
   AF Form 353, Special Intelligence Cover Sheet
6                                                                 AFISRAI31-401 25 JANUARY 2008


       4.2.1. Information Transmission. All personnel will ensure classified material is transmitted by
       the appropriate secure means. Ensure no SCI or TOP SECRET information is transmitted over
       SIPRNet and no classified information of any kind is transmitted over NIPRNet. In concert with
       the Commander, AF ISR Agency NIPRNet policy, all correspondence sent via NIPRNet will
       receive a two-person review to ensure that no classified information is contained therein. NIPRNet
       correspondence should be purely administrative in nature and will address AF ISR Agency mis-
       sion areas only when absolutely necessary. Information dealing with AF ISR Agency mission
       areas which must be on NIPRNet will be approved by Unit CC, Directorate two letters or equiva-
       lent. The authorizer will insure the email contains no classified information.
    4.3. Automated Information System (AIS) Storage Media. Unit personnel who receive computer
    storage media, such as magnetic or paper-tape reels, cartridges, cassettes, removable hard disks, mag-
    netic cards, diskettes, or removable typewriter cassettes, will ensure the appropriate SF 700-series
    classification and SF 711, Data Descriptor Label are attached. Optical Disks (CDs, CD-ROM, and
    DVD etc.) will be marked with classification, unit, and duty phone number with a paint pen or perma-
    nent marker. Containers holding AIS media will also be marked with appropriate SF 700 series Clas-
    sification label and SF 711. Handling caveats will be placed on the SF 711.
    4.4. AIS Equipment. All automated information systems (i.e., printer, monitor, desktop computer
    etc.) must be properly identified with the appropriate SF 700-series classification label. SCI systems
    will be marked with the SF 712 and will be visibly marked with the level of classification and han-
    dling caveat the system is accredited to process. This can be accomplished by writing directly on the
    SF 712 or by using a locally produced yellow sticker with black writing adjacent to or on the SF 712
    without covering any printed portion of the form.
    4.5. Facsimile Transmission. The sender is responsible to ensure them and another knowledgeable
    individual review each document for classified content before transmitting over a facsimile machine.
    If the document contains classified material, the sender should ensure the document is appropriately
    marked. The sender will also ensure the facsimile machines used to transmit and receive the transmis-
    sion are approved at the appropriate classification level. All facsimiles will be preceded with a com-
    pleted AF Form 3535.
       4.5.1. All facsimile machines inside a SCIF must have the approval to operate from AF ISR
       Agency/SO. Additionally, all facsimile machines must be accredited. The unit Information System
       Security Manager (ISSM) accomplishes this. Classified facsimile machines can only be approved
       by the ISSM for transmission of TS//SI/TK compartments of SCI. All other compartments must
       have approval of the appropriate program control officer. Post a copy of the accreditation letter
       and fax approval letter by the facsimile machine. Facsimile machines will be marked with the
       appropriate classification label. Each unit/directorate with facsimile machines will have a standard
       operating procedure covering classified/unclassified procedures and specific user instructions for
       each machine. Additional requirements are listed in the Joint DoDIIS/Cryptologic SCI Informa-
       tion Systems Security Standards.
    4.6. Document Reproduction. Office copiers may be designated for unclassified or classified use.
    Ensure copiers designated for classified use are clearly marked for the level of material authorized.
    Copiers not authorized for classified reproduction must be clearly marked and posted as such. All
    machines capable of producing copies inside a SCIF, to include facsimile machines, must be marked
    with a sign stating whether they are authorized to reproduce SCI. Markings must appear directly in the
    line-of-sight of the individual using the copier. Visibly post AFISRAVA31-402, Stop-Do Not Use This
AFISRAI31-401 25 JANUARY 2008                                                                             7


   Machine for Collateral or SCI Classified Reproduction-Stop, for copiers designated for the reproduc-
   tion of unclassified material. Similarly, post AFISRAVA31-403, Classified Reproduction Rules, for
   copiers designated for the reproduction of classified material. Copiers that have the capability of stor-
   ing images must be procured and accredited IAW NSA 130-1, Annex W.
   4.7. Document Destruction. Destroy all non-record classified information when you no longer have
   an operational need for it. Dispose of classified material into Document Destruction System (DDS)
   bags with properly affixed and filled in burn bag labels. Use AF ISR Agency Form 3, Paper Document
   Disintegration System (DDS) Label, for paper products. Use AF ISR Agency Form 4, Plastic Docu-
   ment Disintegration System (DDS) Label, for plastic products (i.e. floppy disks, overheads, and vid-
   eotapes, CDs, DVDs etc.). Seal these bags when full and take to the DDS facility located in building
   2000, room 139 or shred them in a National Security Agency approved destruction device. If the DDS
   facility is closed and the drop chutes located on the second and third floors are locked, return the bags
   to your office. AF ISR Agency/SO must approve all devices used to destroy classified material. A
   copy of the approval letter will be placed in the security manager’s handbook and posted by the
   destruction device. Material shredded in NSA approved devices may be treated as unclassified and
   disposed of accordingly. In areas not approved for open storage of classified information, in use or
   filled burn bags must be stored in approved storage containers.
      4.7.1. Units/directorates using cross cut shredders not on the current approved NSA high security
      cross cut shredder listing, but approved by AF ISR Agency/SO will take the additional step of
      emptying the bag of shredded waste after 100 sheets of paper or more have been shredded. The
      bag will be taken by an appropriately cleared individual to the dumpster and the contents of the
      bag will be spread throughout the dumpster.
      4.7.2. To avoid the possibility of accidentally disposing of classified material in the trash or recy-
      cle receptacles, all paper products produced in a SCIF will be placed into DDS bags. After con-
      ducting a review of newspapers and magazines for classified material, they may be disposed of in
      the trash or recycle receptacles.
   4.8. Annual Cleanout Day. Units/Directorates will designate one day every year to identify
   non-record classified documents no longer needed and destroy them. Annotate this destruction in a
   memorandum and provide the security manager an information copy to be maintained in the Security
   Manager’s Handbook.
   4.9. Equipment Disposal. Dispose of computer equipment and security containers in accordance
   with current guidelines. Equipment and furniture that may have contained or stored classified material
   must be checked for classified material prior to disposal. Disassemble equipment to the point where
   an inspection will prove beyond a doubt that no classified is present. The inspection must be con-
   ducted by at least two individuals cleared for the level of material the equipment could have con-
   tained. The equipment will be labeled with a description, serial number, and the names, unit, and
   telephone numbers of the personnel conducting the inspection.

5. Mail Distribution:
   5.1. Sender Responsibilities. Do not put classified material in an SF Form 65B, US Government
   Messenger Envelope (commonly referred to as a “Holey Joe” or “Shotgun”). Distribute classified
   information through the appropriate service, US Postal Service or the Defense Courier Service (DCS).
8                                                                 AFISRAI31-401 25 JANUARY 2008


       5.1.1. US Postal Service. Use “Registered Mail” or “US Postal Service Express Mail” when send-
       ing Secret or Confidential collateral material and address it to an activity only, not an individual.
       Contact the AF ISR Agency/DSRC Mail Distribution Center for specific procedures.
       5.1.2. Defense Courier Service (DCS). Send Top Secret collateral and SCI material only via the
       DCS.
    5.2. Couriering:
       5.2.1. DoD policy states that couriering of classified material is authorized only after all other
       authorized means of transmitting (FAX, DCS, E-Mail, etc.) classified material have been
       exhausted.
          5.2.1.1. Security Managers Responsibilities:
              5.2.1.1.1. Security Managers are responsible for issuing Courier Authorization Letters and
              the DD Form 2501, Courier Authorization, for all collateral information and material
              within their respective directorate. If there is a continuing need to courier collateral infor-
              mation or material, Security Managers may issue a DD Form 2501. The Security Manager
              is responsible for ensuring the appropriate training is given to the courier prior to issuance
              of the DD Form 2501. Initial and annual training will be conducted, documented, and
              retained by the Unit Security Manager in the Security Manager’s Handbook. DD Form
              2501s are valid in the San Antonio Metropolitan area only and issued for no longer than
              one year. Individuals who have no continuing need to courier may be issued a Courier Des-
              ignation Letter each time they have to courier collateral information or material. Unit
              Security Manager’s must still ensure the appropriate training is given to the courier prior to
              issuance of the Courier Designation Letter. Courier Designation Letters are also issued to
              individuals when collateral information or material is to be couriered outside of the San

          5.2.1.2. AF ISR Agency/SO Responsibilities:
              5.2.1.2.1. AF ISR Agency/SO issues courier authorizations for SCI couriers. If there is a
              continuing need for couriering SCI information or material, Unit Security Manager’s must
              send the request for issuance of the DD Form 2501 to the AF ISR Agency/SO. This request
              should be made using memorandum format and sent to AF ISR Agency/SOCD identifying
              the name, grade, SSAN, organization, unit mailing address, and office symbol of the indi-
              vidual. If there is not a continuing need for couriering SCI information or material, a Cou-
              rier Designation Letter will be issued by the AF ISR Agency/SO for the individual. Unit
              Security Managers will request the Courier Designation Letter following the same memo-
              randum format as for the issuance of the DD Form 2501.
              5.2.1.2.2. AF ISR Agency/SO grants authorization for couriering of SCI on commercial
              aircraft on a case-by-case basis. Security managers will complete a "Request for One-Time
              Courier Letter of Authorization for Commercial Air," see Attachment 3, and have the
              director/commander sign it. Security managers will also complete the "SCI Courier Letter
              of Authorization for Commercial Air Travel Worksheet," see Attachment 4.
       5.2.2. Only, wing, group, or center commanders may authorize couriers to transport collateral
       material on commercial aircraft traveling outside the United States.
AFISRAI31-401 25 JANUARY 2008                                                                               9


       5.2.3. Inside AF ISR Agency Restricted Area Complex. When couriering classified information
       inside buildings 2000, 2007, 2028, or 2058, use an opaque envelope, marked with appropriate
       security classification, or the required cover sheet. When couriering classified information outside
       these buildings but within the secured (fenced) area, use inner and outer coverings. A locking
       briefcase or locking bag (canvas/leather) may serve as the outer covering. Opaque envelopes or
       cover sheets may serve as the inner wrapping.
       5.2.4. Outside AF ISR Agency Restricted Area Complex. When transporting classified material
       into or out of the confines of AF ISR Agency Restricted Area Complex, courier authorization is
       required. Individuals must contact their Security Manager for the appropriate courier authoriza-
       tion.

6. Security Incidents. It is the responsibility of anyone who detects a security incident to first secure
classified information.
   6.1. The following actions will be followed for the specified categories of incidents.
       6.1.1. Hard copy classified information left not secured. Immediately pick the material up and
       secure it in a location cleared for storage of the classified you found. In instances where there is
       more material than you can secure by yourself, get any individual to assist you. Simply advise
       them of the situation and request their assistance. NOTE: Efforts should be made to have a cleared
       individual assist; however, the ultimate goal is to protect the classified information. If an
       uncleared individual is used to assist in securing the classified information/material, the cleared
       individual will ensure the uncleared person is taken to the AIA/SO to complete an Inadvertent Dis-
       closure Agreement. The person taking charge of the scene should get the identity of all personnel
       involved (full name, rank, SSN, unit, and duty phone). A simple way to obtain this information is
       to get their military ID card and keep it until information can be recorded once all classified has
       been secured.
       6.1.2. Automated Information Systems (AIS). Take immediate actions to secure the classified
       material. Using secure means, notify your Information Systems Security Officer (ISSO) and secu-
       rity manager (SM). Security incidents are classified IAW AFI 31-401. If classified information is
       on AIS connected to a network, disconnect the AIS from the network. The ISSO should report the
       incident to AF ISR Agency/SOC via secure means for cleanup actions.
       6.1.3. Exposure of classified information to uncleared personnel. Classified information can only
       be released to personnel who have proper access and need to know. When classified information
       has been released to uncleared personnel, remove the classified information from their possession.
       Do not allow them to leave your control. If necessary, contact Security Forces for assistance. Get
       the names and SSNs of personnel exposed. Notify your SM immediately. AF ISR Agency/SO will
       be contacted to determine if an inadvertent disclosure briefing will be administered.
   6.2. In all situations, AF ISR Agency/SO will be notified as soon as possible. Provide details of
   the incident and identify all personnel involved (full name, rank, SSN, unit, and duty phone). When
   practical, provide a copy of any classified information related to the incident. At a minimum, provide
   the classification with handling caveats and original classification authority or data owner.
   6.3. AF ISR Agency/SO will assign a security incident case number with a suspense date for the
   final report, and will request the head of the directorate/unit responsible to appoint an inquiry official.
10                                                                  AFISRAI31-401 25 JANUARY 2008


     AF ISR Agency/SO will brief the inquiry official on how to conduct the inquiry and provide them
     with additional assistance when needed. AF ISR Agency/SO will close the case after final review.
     6.4. Directors/Commanders will ensure their personnel are trained on their responsibilities concern-
     ing security incidents. Whenever there is a security incident involving an actual or potential compro-
     mise of classified information, appoint an inquiry official for security incidents and provide a copy of
     the appointment letter to AF ISR Agency/SO. This individual should be equal to or senior in grade to
     the individual(s) involved, however, as a minimum, be an E-7/GG-09 or above. Review the inquiry
     official's report and ensure corrective action is taken to stop reoccurrence. Take disciplinary action
     against offenders. Determine on a case-by-case basis if a Security Information File (SIF) will be
     opened/required on offenders. Provide a final report to AF ISR Agency/SO. Ensure the data owner is
     notified as soon as possible so they can conduct a damage assessment.
     6.5. Security Forces personnel will only be used initially to secure a crime scene or apprehend/
     detain offenders. Cleared owner/user personnel will be used to secure classified.
     6.6. Individuals who have knowledge of the loss or possible compromise of classified informa-
     tion will immediately report it to their security manager. Any individual who discovers classified
     information out of proper control will take custody of the information, safeguard it in an appropriate
     manner, and immediately notify their security manager.

7. Security Education and Awareness Training. The Unit Security Education and Awareness Training
program will include all personnel authorized or expected to be authorized access to classified informa-
tion. The unit-training program consists of the following five categories:
     7.1. Initial Briefings. Personnel granted a security clearance will not be permitted to have access to
     SCI classified information until they have received an initial security briefing and have signed a non-
     disclosure agreement. Security managers will ensure all personnel receive a briefing of all items in
     Attachment 5 and document this training in the Security Manager Handbook.
     7.2. Quarterly Training. Quarterly training should be conducted after the AF ISR Agency Security
     Training, Education, and Motivation Council meeting so pertinent information is disseminated in a
     timely manner. Training topics are listed in the unit’s annual security training plan, see Attachment 5.
     Training can also be conducted at Commander’s Call, through training packages, or through any
     method deemed appropriate, such as, newsletters, bulletins, or memorandums.
     7.3. Foreign Travel Briefings. The unit security manager will give personnel with SCI access a
     defensive foreign travel briefing before official and unofficial travel. The briefing will alert them to
     the potential for harassment, exploitation, provocation, capture, entrapment, or criminal activity. Indi-
     viduals will also be given a risk-of-capture briefing alerting them to techniques used to force or trick
     them to divulge classified information if captured or detained.
        7.3.1. Personnel will report anticipated foreign travel and provide a travel itinerary to immediate
        supervisors. Supervisors will ensure personnel receive travel briefings and monitor the itinerary
        from a safety point-of-view.
        7.3.2. AF ISR Agency/SOCO and the local OSI detachment provide Antiterrorism/Force Protec-
        tion (AT/FP) Level 1 and Area of Responsibility Threat briefings. These briefings meet DoD AT/
        FP and foreign travel requirements for personnel with SCI access.

   7.4. Termination Briefings. Upon termination of employment, administrative withdrawal of secu-
   rity clearance, or contemplated absence from duty or employment for 45 days or more, unit military
   personnel and civilian employees will be given a termination briefing, return all classified material,
   and execute a Security Termination Statement. AF ISR Agency/SOPI, Indoctrination and Debriefs,
   performs the termination briefing.
   7.5. Documentation. The security manager documents the training using either a general-purpose
   form or automated database, listing specific training, name of trainee, name of trainer, and date con-
   ducted. Trainees are required to acknowledge training with signature (written or digital) or initials.
   Records of training will be maintained in the Security Manager’s Handbook for one year.

8. Miscellaneous. The security office has provided a number of sample letters, how to’s and training
materials on the headquarters domain global data drive in the security folder. Sample letters are also avail-
able on the security hill global data drive in the security folder.
