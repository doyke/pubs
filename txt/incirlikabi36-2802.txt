6. BOARD SCORING.
  6.1. General Guidance.
     6.1.1. Board Presidents/Members may discuss the contents of the packages, questions or
     concerns amongst the other members within their board. Understand board members are
     not entitled to know who the winner of the category is as the final approval on the
     recommendations is the commander. There could be privilege/restricted information the
     commander that has the board is unaware of that could affect the outcome where the
     board members will not be informed on.
     6.1.2. Members must be fair and impartial and set aside any bias. Evaluate packages
     based on the substance of the nomination. Keep in mind it is not the “importance” of
     one’s job being rated, but rather what the individual accomplished within their job/scope
     of responsibility.
     6.1.3. Compare the accomplishments of each nominee and then score accordingly. Look
     for Action, Result and Impact…what did they do, how well did they do it and what was
     the impact on the mission/people, etc.
     6.1.4. Nomination packages, score sheets, and scoring instructions will be centralized in
     a shared electronic folder by the 39 ABW/CCC or 39 ABW/CCCE. Note: Board
     Presidents/Members will be notified by e-mail when granted permission to access the
     shared electronic folder.
  6.2. Board Members.
INCIRLIKABI36-2802 4 DECEMBER 2014                                                           17


     6.2.1. All packages will be scored on the score sheet provided in the appropriate category
     folder (Attachment 1, Attachment 2 and Attachment 3). Prior to the board, review
     and score each package. The day of the board, you will meet with the Board President to
     tally scores. At this time, bring forth any questions or concerns for discussion.
  6.3. Ranking Packages (see example on score sheet).
     6.3.1. By category, compare each nominee and accordingly rank order each nominee 1
     thru 5 (1=best; 2=next best…5=least best; etc.).
     6.3.2. Next, multiply the category ranking by the associated multiplier to attain a
     category score. Note: Repeat this step for all three categories (if required).
     6.3.3. Once all three categories are scored, simply tally scores for each nominee into a
     cumulative score.
     6.3.4. Use the cumulative scores to determine an overall ordinal ranking for each
     nominee. Low score wins. No ties are permitted. Use your judgment and experience to
     break the tie.
     6.3.5. Ultimately, Board Members owe the Board President a ranking of 1-6 for each
     nominee. Note: The Board President’s scores will only be used in the event of a tie that
     affects the outcome.
  6.4. Board President.
     6.4.1. You are responsible for the outcome and integrity of the board.
     6.4.2. You will review and score all packages, however, you will only use your scores in
     the event of a tie that affects the outcome (see para 5.4.6) (Attachment 1, Attachment 2
     and Attachment 3).
     6.4.3. Your board will assemble with you to discuss each package. During this time the
     board members may discuss package contents, questions or concerns they have. Note:
     Although board members may have a difference of opinion, you should address
     significant disparities of score that affect the outcome.
     6.4.4. Record all board member’s scores on the master score sheet.
     6.4.5. The winner is the nominee who received the lowest cumulative ranking from the
     board members. As the board President you are not obligated to provide the winner of
     the category as the commander has final approval on the nominees. There could be
     privilege/restricted information the commander that has the board is unaware of that
     could affect the outcome where the board members will not be informed of.
     6.4.6. If a tie occurs that affects the outcome, add your package scoring to the cumulative
     totals to determine the winner.
     6.4.7. Prior to collecting the sheets, ensure board members print rank/name then sign the
     sheets. Return all score sheets to include the master score sheet immediately to the 39
     ABW/CCC or designated Awards Program Monitor.

        QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL AWARD BOARD MEMBER GUIDANCE

A2.1. Quarterly/Annual Board Members are under 39 ABW/CC direction not to discuss their
scored packages or the results of the board. Winners’ names are only to be released at the
appropriate Awards Ceremony.
   A2.1.1. Board Members may discuss the contents of the packages, questions or concerns
   amongst the other members within their board. Members are not to discuss the scoring or
   outcome of the packages with other board members or anyone outside of the board.
A2.2. Members must be fair and impartial. Set aside any bias (positive or negative) and
evaluate the packages based on the substance of the write-ups (AF Form 1206). Quality and
impact of the accomplishments are important, not the quantity. Please keep in mind it is not the
“importance” of one’s job you’re rating, but what the individual did within their job/scope of
responsibility. For example: SSgt Doe dropped 50 bombs on Baghdad and TSgt Shmoe flipped
50 burgers at the dining facility. These are their jobs-one is not better than the other. What did
they do in their jobs that set them apart from the person on the next shift? Did SSgt Doe have a
bomb on target accuracy rating of 90% when the squadron average was 60%? Did TSgt Shmoe
flip 75 burgers an hour when the average cook flipped only 50? Did Shmoe invent a new BBQ
sauce that 90% of the customers liked better than the old one? What did the individual do to
make a difference and improve his/her function in the Air Force?
A2.3. Compare the accomplishments of each nominee and then score accordingly. Look for
Action, Result and Impact…what did they do, how well did they do it and what was the impact
on the mission/people, etc.
   A2.3.1. LEADERSHIP and Job performance in primary duty: The nominee’s leadership and
   job performance in their primary duties, including the development of new techniques, must
   have contributed significantly to increase mission effectiveness during the award period.
   You should be looking for individual accomplishments-not unit accomplishments. Individual
   awards ought to be included here.
   A2.3.2. SIGNIFICANT Self-Improvement:               The nominee must have shown this
   improvement through off-duty education, achievements in professional or cultural societies
   or associations, development of creative abilities and so on during the award period. This
   includes military and civilian classes, professional development, self-development, etc.
   A2.3.3. BASE OR COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT: The member must have contributed
   tangibly or intangibly to the military or civilian community’s welfare, morale or status during
   the award period. This includes involvement such as Top-3, booster club, coach of a youth
   athletic team, scout leader, church elder, etc. Being a member of an organization is not as
   strong as being in a leadership position (president, secretary, coach, team leader, head
   organizer, etc.).
A2.4. Prepare questions for the Face-to-Face board as directed by the Board President. Provide
your questions to the Board President for final approval before the Face-to-Face board convenes.
Categories for questioning will be Military Knowledge, Current Events, Opinion Based, Job
Based, etc. addressed at the nominees appropriate rank and skill level. Score according to
number of correct answers to board questions, military bearing, dress and appearance and
INCIRLIKABI36-2802 4 DECEMBER 2014                                                          21


communication skills; i.e. nominees ability to maintain focus in high pressure environment,
military movements, communicate their answers appropriately (verbal and non-verbal attributes)
and overall presence.
A2.5. All packages and Face-to-Face boards will be scored on the score sheets provided in the
appropriate category folder. Prior to the board, review and score each package. The day of the
board, you will meet with the Board President to tally scores. At this time, bring forth any
questions or concerns for discussion.
A2.6. Ranking Packages (see example on score sheet): By category, compare each nominee and
rank order each nominee 1 thru 11 (1=best; 2=next best; etc.). Next, multiply the category
ranking by the associated multiplier to attain a category score. Repeat this step for all three
categories. Once all three categories are scored, simply tally scores for each nominee into a
cumulative score. Use the cumulative scores to determine an overall ranking for each nominee.
Low score wins. No ties are permitted. Use your judgment and experience to break the tie.
Ultimately, you owe the Board President a ranking of 1-5 for each nominee. Note: The Board
President’s scores will only be used in the event of a tie that affects the outcome.
