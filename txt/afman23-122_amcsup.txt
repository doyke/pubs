2.6.2.2.3.5. (Added) Units are authorized to request base/organization unique segments (shop
codes) to support unique operational requirements in writing through Headquarters (HQ) Air
Mobility Command (AMC)/A4RMW. Requests must include requested national stock number
(NSNs), quantities, and justification for establishing the new segment(s). HQ AMC/A4RMW
will be the approval authority. The base RSP activity will maintain approved correspondence
when unique segments are requested and approved by HQ AMC/A4RMW.
2.6.5.3. AMC KC-135 and C-130 bases will assess their RSPs using the Personal Computer -
Aircraft Sustainability Model (PCASM). Fleet C-5 and C-17 Assessments are accomplished via
WSMIS/SAM, and are extracted (as required) by HQ AMC/A4RMW. C-5 and C-17 units are not
required to process RSP assessments. Fill rates will be used for 60 days once the new RSP
authorizations are received and loaded (start of annual reconciliation). Further use of fill rates for
assessing RSP will only be used if directed by HQ AMC/A4RMW.
2.6.5.3.1. Process major command (MAJCOM) Combat Supplies Management System (CSMS)
Reconciliation, R30 Update option once copy two of the RSP Reconciliation S05/NGV867 is
forwarded to HQ AMC/A4RMW. This option turns the CSMS flag on to ensure weekly R30
reconciliation is accurate for Air Force Materiel Command reporting. After initial update option
is processed, wait for one crossover and process weekly reconciliation of the R30.
2.6.6.4. Once the war and mobilization plan (WMP)-5 classified flying scenario data is entered
into PC-ASM, the computer and any assessment outputs are classified. Manage them
appropriately.
2.6.11.1.3. (Added) Storage and Handling of MRSP Assets Containing Hazardous Material.
Hazardous material (flammable, combustible, and chemical items) will not be stored in RSPs
while at home station. HQ AMC/A4RMW is authorized to push authorizations for these type
items in the annual economic order quantity (EOQ) XVF file(s). These authorizations will be
considered unsupportable and due-outs and requisitions will not be established to fill the
 4                                                   AFMAN23-122_AMCSUP 6 MARCH 2014


authorizations while at home station. When transferring to a location where no supply support
currently exists and there are seven days or more notice, the home station RSP section will
change the unsupportable authorizations to fully supportable, establish due-outs and due-ins, and
coordinate with the 635 Supply Chain Operations Group (SCOG) to ensure the source of supply
can fill the full authorization of hazardous material prior to RSP departure. If less than seven
days’ notice of transfer is provided, the home station RSP section will coordinate with the 635
SCOG to determine the best course of action necessary to have full RSP authorized quantity of
hazardous items shipped directly to the gaining location to fill the RSP. When an RSP is
transferred to a contingency location where supply support already exists and the detail records
have been transferred to the gaining stock record account number (SRAN), due-outs and
requisitions will be submitted to fill the authorizations. Additionally, prior to transfer, the base
RSP section will coordinate with maintenance to ensure sufficient quantities of hazardous
materials are available (i.e. oil, hydraulic fluid, sealants, etc.) to meet expected demands until the
re-supply pipeline has been established (approximately 21 days for connectivity and initial
delivery). If the tasking is canceled, home station RSP personnel will coordinate with the 635
SCOG weapon system managers to determine the appropriate distribution of hazardous material
already shipped. To prevent returning to home station with hazardous material, upon receipt of
redeployment orders, deployed RSP personnel will change authorizations to unsupportable to
cease replenishment of hazardous material, and every attempt should be made to issue any
remaining hazardous items to maintenance. If unable to issue all hazardous material prior to
departure, deployed RSP personnel will coordinate with the 635 SCOG for direction on
disposition of remaining hazardous material.
2.6.11.1.3.1. (Added) Chemical items can be segregated in the hazardous storage facility at the
home station until time for deployment. RSP personnel will ensure each RSP line item identified
as hazardous material has a material safety data sheet (MSDS) available.
2.6.11.1.4. (Added) Pilferable and classified items are authorized storage in RSPs provided
secure storage is available.
2.6.11.1.5. (Added) Screen the Daily Document Register (D04) or equivalent for internal
changes affecting RSP details.
2.6.14.1. Submit all MRSP/in-place readiness spares package (IRSP)/high priority mission
support kit (HPMSK) recommended additions, changes, or deletions to HQ AMC/A4RMW.
2.6.16.1.1. HQ AMC/A4O will control and direct the use and movement of MRSPs and
personnel designated for units under their control to support missions, contingencies, and
exercises above wing level (as required). Initial notification may be verbal followed by an
official Unit Tasking Code (UTC) notification to confirm tasking. Logistics Readiness Squadron
(LRS) commanders will ensure all personnel tasked to deploy with an MRSP are courier
qualified. Personnel deploying with the RSP will remain with the RSP until it reaches its final
destination. This may require personnel to split up if the RSP pallets are divided between
different aircraft missions. These couriers will ensure proper accountability of the RSP and its
contents while in transit. If an RSP courier experiences problems while in transit they should
contact 635 SCOG unit control center (UCC) at Defense System Network (DSN) 576-4440 or
commercial number (618) 256-4440 during normal duty hours and the 435 SCOS Quick
Response Flight (QRF) DSN 779-8486 or commercial number (618) 229-8486 after normal duty
hours. In the exception that an RSP is tasked without personnel, LRS commanders will

coordinate with HQ AMC A4O/A4RMW to arrange for a courier to accompany MRSP/Mission
Support Kit (MSK)/HPMSK segments if circumstances dictate. The host accountable officer will
provide the name, rank, Air Force Specialty Code and any other pertinent information of the
responsible officer to HQ AMC A4O/A4RMW and 635 SCOG at the time of a verbal or written
tasking. In the rare circumstances when HQ AMC A4O/A4RMW determine a courier will not
accompany the RSP, HQ AMC/A4RMW will coordinate with the 635 SCOG to obtain the name,
rank, and contact information of the responsible officer at the gaining location, and request
notification as soon as the RSP arrives. When directed to deploy an MRSP, base RSP personnel
will take robust actions to fill the MRSP(s) to the maximum extent possible. These actions
include the turn-in and issue of assets from maintenance bench stocks, supply points, tail number
bins, and transferring assets from other MRSP or IRSP segments. Base RSP personnel will
coordinate with the 635 SCOG Weapon System Spares Manager(s) to facilitate acquisition of
critical shortages. RSP personnel will prepare and send a priority deployment notification
message to HQ AMC/A4RMW within 24 hours when an airborne or non-airborne MRSP is
tasked to deploy (Reports Control Symbol (RCS): AMC-LGS(AR)9401). When the purpose for
deploying an MRSP is classified, classify the report accordingly. A redeployment message will
be submitted within 72 hours after return (RCS: AMC-LGS(AR)9402). NOTE: Reports are
assigned emergency status code C2; continue reporting during emergency conditions, normal
precedence. Submit data requirements in this category as prescribed, or as soon as possible after
submission of priority reports. Continue electronic reporting during MINIMIZE. Use the
following formats in Figure 2.1.
