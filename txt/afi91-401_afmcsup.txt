                                           Chapter 1

                                       INTRODUCTION

1.1. Purpose. This instruction implements, IAW AFPD 91-4, Directed Energy Weapons
(DEW), the Air Force DEW Safety Program to protect personnel, property, operational
capability, and the environment from undue risk of damage or harm. The intent of this
instruction is to implement a safety program throughout the lifecycle of a DEW program,
including safety certification for operational use prior to fielding, (see Chapter 3) and the
establishment of a unit level DEW safety program (DEWSP) once a system is operational (see
Chapter 6).
1.2. Applicability.
   1.2.1. This instruction applies to DEW systems using directed energy primarily as a direct
   means to kill, injure, disable, or temporarily incapacitate people or destroy, damage, or
   temporarily incapacitate property or material on the surface, in the air, or in space. Reference
   and supporting information provided in Attachment 1.
       1.2.1.1. DEW systems create unique hazards that are different from conventional and
       nuclear weapons. Potential DEW systems covered by this instruction include, but are not
       limited to, high-energy lasers, microwave and millimeter wave beams, destructive effects
       in support of electronic attack missions, explosive-driven electromagnetic pulse devices,
       laser induced plasma channel systems, non- lethal directed energy weapons, and atomic-
       scale and subatomic particle beam weapons. The power levels of these DEW systems
       span a range from levels that are considered safe for human exposure, through levels that
       can induce pain but cause no permanent cell damage to levels that would be fatal to
       humans or that would destroy materiel.
       1.2.1.2. This instruction applies to acoustic weapons, which are not part of the formal
       definition of DEW, but have similar properties and hazards.
   1.2.2. This instruction does not apply to:
       1.2.2.1. Directed energy devices that support or are an element of a conventional/nuclear
       weapon if directed energy from those devices is not intended to deny, disrupt, damage, or
       destroy enemy equipment, facilities, or personnel.
       1.2.2.2. Directed energy devices that are not weapons including guidance radar, laser
       range finders, target designators, medical lasers, DEW trainers or simulators, electronic
       warfare systems not included in Section 1.2.1.1., aircraft self-defense laser systems
       designed solely to jam the seekers of air-to-air missiles, etc. The safety programs for
       these systems are detailed in other publications, such as Air Force Instruction (AFI) 48-
       139, Laser and Optical Radiation Protection Program, and Air Force Occupational
       Safety and Health Standard (AFOSH-STD) 48-9, Electro-magnetic Frequency (EMF)
       Radiation Occupational Health Program, and AFOSH-STD 48-20, Occupational Noise
       and Hearing Conservation Program.
       1.2.2.3. Systems determined by the AF/SE to fall under other instructions.
       1.2.2.4. Hazardous materials, electro-magnetic frequency energy, or electricity before
       they become part of the weapon system. DEW related hazardous materials will be
 6                                                  AFI91-401_AFMCSUP_I 5 MARCH 2014


        managed like any other similar hazardous material under provisions of applicable safety
        guidance, (e.g. AFI 32-7086, Hazardous Materials Management, Air Force Joint Manual
        (AFJMAN) 23-209, Storage and Handling of Hazardous Materials). AFOSH-STD 48-9
        applies to electro- magnetic frequency hazards and AFI 91-203, Air Force Consolidated
        Occupational Safety Instruction, for electrical hazards.
1.3. General DEWSB Policy. The DEWSB provides the safety certification of directed energy
weapon systems for use by USAF personnel. For systems developed in an acquisition program
of record or purchased as standardized systems, this takes the form of a safety certificat ion. For
informal acquisitions or certain tests, the DEWSB provides a hazard assessment based on all
available information, in lieu of a full certification. Safety certification or approval by another
US military service or foreign government does not replace DEWSB review requirements.
     1.3.1. Certification Function. DEWSB safety certification is required for each DEW prior to
     operational and training use by USAF personnel. Milestone Decision Authorities (MDA)
     shall include DEW safety certification in their production and fielding decisions. Program
     Managers will include the certification in their program’s Environment, Safety, and
     Occupational Health (ESOH) documentation. Certification is based on a DEW Technical
     Safety Study (DEWTSS) reviewed during a regular or special meeting. Results from the
     DEWTSS will be the basis for DEWSB certification recommendations. DEW certification
     will be requested through the MAJCOM/SE to HQ AFSEC/SEW.
     1.3.2. Risk Assessment Function. If there is a compelling operational need for a system that
     cannot meet the standards of certification, the DEWSB issues a risk assessment to evaluate
     hazards prior to acceptance by the using organization.
     1.3.3. Test Function. The DEWSB issues design safety assessments for testing uncertified
     DEW systems when testing live systems on USAF aircraft and ground platforms and/or
     involving USAF vehicles, personnel, and infrastructure as test subjects. Responsible Test
     Organizations (RTO) will seek DEWSB hazard analysis as a part of their Safety Review
     Board (SRB) process prior to conducting tests as outlined in AFI 99-103, Capabilities-Bases
     Test and Evaluation. DEWSB approval and proximity restrictions must be obtained prior to
     the testing or employment of DEWs with or in the vicinity of nuclear or conventional
     munitions to prevent inadvertent functioning or damage. The Test Hazards Assessment
     Review (THAR) conducted during a regular or special meeting supports test safety
     assessment. Programs may enter captive carriage test phases prior to DEWSB assessment of
     the live- launch or live-fire phases. Prepare a THAR as outlined in AFI 91-205, Nonnuclear
     Munitions Safety Board.
     1.3.4. Informal Acquisition Function. Informal acquisitions, such as laboratory technology
     demonstration projects, must seek hazard assessment from the DEWSB prior to use by non-
     developmental USAF personnel, unless supervised on-site by development personnel. For
     this purpose, developmental personnel are defined as the developing government
     organization and its contractors.

  DIRECTED ENERGY WEAPONS SAFETY CERTIFICATION PROCEDURE FOR
               PROGRAMS OF RECORD AND COTS/NDI

3.1. Overview.
   3.1.1. DEWSB safety certification is required for all DEW prior to operational and training
   use by USAF personnel. The certification process is conducted in two phases. Phase I
   initiates no later than 60 days after acquisition Milestone B to develop safety design
   standards early in the acquisition cycle. Phase II occurs after acquisition Milestone C to
   review and determine DEW safety certification prior to operational and training use. The
   DEWSB oversees the DEW certification processes. Certification will inc lude approval and
   proximity restrictions for DEW projects with or in the vicinity of nuclear or conventional
   munitions to prevent inadvertent functioning or damage.
   3.1.2. The DEWCP details the strategy to ensure that the weapon is in compliance with
   applicable safety and health criteria.
   3.1.3. The DEWSB will issue a Certification Statement to the PM following Phase II
   approval of the DEWCP.
   3.1.4. Since Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations (JCTDs) have varying acquisition
   timelines and objectives, safety certification phasing will be handled on a case-by-case basis
   by the DEWSB. The certification phasing will be determined using the acquisition transition
   plan and an initial safety/hazards/environmental assessment from the JCTD Management
   Plan required by the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Advanced Systems
   & Concepts.
   3.1.5. Some Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and Non-Developmental Item (NDI) systems
   have the potential to be used as DEW systems (e.g. laser dazzlers). Becaus e the standard
   acquisition program milestones and phases do not exist for a COTS or NDI program, the
   purchasing organization will prepare a Phase II DEWCP (excluding portions identified by
   AFSEC/SEW as not applicable) and include within it elements of a Phase I DEWCP
   identified by AFSEC/SEW as applicable.
   3.1.6. AFSEC/SEW will determine if DEW certification is required for any system that has
   already been fielded prior to implementation of this AFI.
3.2. Certification Requirements.
   3.2.1. Safety Requirement. All fully-developed DEWs will be certified prior to operational
   or training use as required by AFPD 91-4. Demonstration systems that will be used
   temporarily will be assessed in accordance with Chapter 4 in lieu of certification.
   3.2.2. DEW Certification Plan (DEWCP).
      3.2.2.1. Purpose. The DEWCP communicates to the DEWSB the intent to comply with
      AF DEW safety criteria. The DEWCP will document the safety procedures and controls
      used to mitigate specific hazards within the operational DEWSP.

3.6. Certification Determination.
   3.6.1. The DEWSB Chair will consider the findings and recommendations of the DEWSB.
   3.6.2. If approved, the DEWSB Executive Secretary will provide a DEW Statement of
   Certification, signed by the DEWSB Chair, to the PM.
       3.6.2.1. The statement will list the hardware, software, procedures, and interfaces
       evaluated and their certification status.
       3.6.2.2. The Statement of Certification will be supplied to PM no later than 60 days after
       DEWSB convenes the Phase II review of the DEWCP.
   3.6.3. If disapproved, the DEWSB Executive Secretary will send a Statement of Deficiencies
   to the PM.
       3.6.3.1. The statement will list the items evaluated and their deficiencies.
       3.6.3.2. The Statement of Deficiencies will be documented and supplied to the PM no
       later than 60 days after DEWSB convenes the Phase II review of the DEWCP.
3.7. Certification Procedure for DEW System Modifications.
   3.7.1. The following guidance applies to modifications of a DEW system that has already
   been safety certified. This includes all physical and functional configuration changes to
AFI91-401_AFMCSUP_I 5 MARCH 2014                                                              17


   existing certified hardware, software, proced ures, and interfaces; addition of new equipment;
   and new operational uses for existing equipment.
      3.7.1.1. The recertification process can be tailored. The scope of DEWSB review will be
      dependent on the modification’s impact on the DEW certification.
      3.7.1.2. DEW Certification Statement.         The PM will attach the current DEW
      Certification Statement to the new modification of the DEWCP.
      3.7.1.3. No-Impact Statement. If the PM determines the system modification will have
      no impact to the existing DEW certification, the PM can submit a no- impact statement
      (as an addendum to the existing DEWCP) with sufficient supporting analysis to justify
      this conclusion.
          3.7.1.3.1. If the DEWSB determines that the no- impact statement is warranted, the
          DEW certification statement will be reissued for the modified system.
          3.7.1.3.2. If the DEWSB non-concurs, the PM shall modify the DEWCP to address
          the areas of concern and resubmit to the DEWSB.
3.8. Certification Risk Assessment Procedure. Follow this process when the DEW fails to
meet the requirements for certification or in situations of urgent military need where the
operational necessity outweighs the operational risk.
   3.8.1. Certification risk assessment:
      3.8.1.1. In cases where a system component or safety require ment is preventing
      certification, the MAJCOM sends a risk assessment request letter to AFSEC/SEW.
      3.8.1.1. (AFMC) Follow MIL-STD-882E, Department of Defense Standard Practice:
      System Safety for risk level approval and send risk assessment requests through weapons
      safety office that has oversight of DEW system to HQ AFMC/SEW.
      3.8.1.2. The PM will include the DEWCR from Phase II of the DEWCP.
      3.8.1.3. A risk assessment must include an independent hazard analysis, IAW MIL-STD-
      882E, which demonstrates how the proposed design satisfies the intent of safety
      certification requirements.
      3.8.1.4. AFSEC/SEW in conjunction with the DEWSB will analyze the adequacy of
      compensatory measures when criteria cannot be met to determine if an adequate level of
      safety exists and if a risk acceptance is justified.
      3.8.1.5. If approved, the DEWSB Executive Secretary will issue a certification risk
      assessment, signed by the DEWSB Chair, to the PM and MAJCOM.
      3.8.1.6. If certification is denied again, the PM should seek other hazard mitigation
      alternatives to ensure deployment and mission success. The PM may reapply for
      certification when additional hazard mitigation techniq ues are completed.
   3.8.2. Risk assessment for urgent operational needs.
      3.8.2.1. If rapidly fielded capability solutions are requested by combatant commands to
      support an urgent operational need, the PM will request a certification risk assessment
      through the MAJCOM to AFSEC/SEW for DEWSB coordination and approval.
 18                                                AFI91-401_AFMCSUP_I 5 MARCH 2014


       3.8.2.1. (AFMC) Follow MIL-STD-882E, Department of Defense Standard Practice:
       System Safety for risk level approval and send risk assessment requests through weapons
       safety office that has oversight of DEW system to HQ AFMC/SEW.
       3.8.2.2. The rapid fielding request must include a Residual Risk Analysis (RRA). An
       RRA is an overall assessment of a system’s suitability for emergency operations from a
       safety perspective. It should provide all information necessary to make informed risk
       management decisions. The RRA must address all items previously listed in the
       Statement of Deficiencies, Section 3.6.3., and should also include:
          3.8.2.2.1. A risk analysis using the approach outlined in MIL-STD-882E.
          3.8.2.2.2. Recommendations and strategies to mitigate mishap risks exposed through
          operations or maintenance.
          3.8.2.2.3. A risk mitigation strategy approval by the appropriate Risk Acceptance
          Authority. Determine the appropriate Risk Acceptance Authority using the highest
          mishap category of the initial risks (while recommended actions are being
          incorporated into the design) and residual risks (after all recommended actions have
          been incorporated). Refer to MIL-STD-882E, Table III, Risk Acceptance Matrix, and
          to DoDI 5000.02, Enclosure 12, Para. 6, to determine the required mishap Risk
          Acceptance Authority.
       3.8.2.3. The PM will submit the operational necessity, the scope of intended use, and the
       period of time required to be excluded from the normal certification process.
       3.8.2.4. If approved, AFSEC/SEW will provide a certification risk assessment to the PM.
       During the risk assessment period, data should be collected on safety related operational
       deficiencies and potential system improvements.
3.9. Operational Decertification:
   3.9.1. The DEWSB may decertify items that have demonstrated inadequate safety through
   analysis, testing, or operational performance. Decertification may be required when critical
   components or systems have been improperly used, improperly stored, or not maintained
   according to the DEWCP. The decertification may involve a specific user organization or
   the entire inventory.
   3.9.2. Any DoD agency may send a recommendation for decertification to AFSEC/SEW for
   DEWSB review. The recommendation must identify the DEW item and include
   documentation that supports the recommendation to decertify.
   3.9.3. As the authority on decertification actions, the DEWSB reviews the recommendation
   and takes action to notify all affected parties. The DEWSB will then work with the PM to
   determine the best course of action to re-certify affected DEW systems.
3.10. Test Safety Assessment:
   3.10.1. The DEWSB issues design safety assessments for testing uncertified, yet live, DEWs
   listed in Section 1.2.1 onboard USAF aircraft, aircraft not in the USAF inventory flown by
   AF pilots, USAF ground platforms, and/or involving USAF vehicles, personnel, and
   infrastructure as test subjects. DEWSB approval and proximity restrictions must be obtained
   prior to the testing or employment of DEWs with or in the vicinity of nuclear or conventional
AFI91-401_AFMCSUP_I 5 MARCH 2014                                                              19


  munitions to prevent inadvertent functioning or damage. The captive carriage phase of test
  programs are governed by the USAF SEEK EAGLE Program and may be entered prior to
  DEWSB assessment of live-launch or live-fire phases. DEWSB assessment is not required
  for tests of new DEWs that are non- functional or in by-pass mode when tested. DEW tests of
  live systems conducted in- laboratory are exempt from the DEWSB review, but must follow
  local safety and human use reviews as required.
  3.10.2. Test hazards are assessed via the THAR conducted during a regular or special
  DEWSB meeting. THAR identified hazards are then evaluated by the RTO during the SRB
  process. An appropriate test approval authority then reviews the hazards and mitigating
  measures and approves the test to proceed or directs further mitigating actions / restrictions.
  Consult AFI 91-205 for instructions to prepare the THAR.
     3.10.2.1. The PM will provide read-ahead information to support identification of test
     hazards at least 14 days prior to conducting a THAR. Such information may be a simple
     point paper for non-complex items, or it may be a comprehensive technical data package
     for test weapons that are potentially more hazardous.

                                          Chapter 4

       DIRECTED ENERGY WEAPONS SAFETY APPROVAL FOR INFORMAL
                       ACQUISITION PROGRAMS

4.1. Overview.
   4.1.1. This chapter addresses DEWs that are acquired outside of the DoD formal acquisition
   process, such as R&D, early concept prototypes, etc. Informal acquisitions are typically
   performed by AFRL, Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT), United States Air Force
   Academy, etc. Often, these systems are developed as technology demonstrators which are
   pre-Milestone B and do not have the same documentation requirements as a standard DoD
   Program of Record. This chapter provides safety approval guidance for programs preparing
   for certain tests or for operations by non-developmental personnel.
4.2. DEW Activities Requiring DEWSB Review, Assessment, and Approval. All DEW
activities will be governed by the activity’s normal test safety review and approval processes,
with the exception of the following cases:
   4.2.1. DEW projects require DEWSB review and safety assessme nt prior to demonstration
   on non-US territory. Employment or other uses require DEWSB approval.
   4.2.2. DEW projects require safety assessment prior to unsupervised operation, training, and
   maintenance by personnel other than the developers. For this purpose, developers are
   government personnel assigned to the organization (AFRL, AFIT, etc.) that developed the
   DEW project and its contractors.
   4.2.3. DEW project field tests of live systems on board USAF aircraft, aircraft not in the
   USAF inventory flown by AF pilots, USAF ground platforms, and/or involving USAF
   vehicles, personnel, and infrastructure as test subjects require DEWSB review and safety
   assessment. DEW tests of live systems conducted in- laboratory are exempt from the
   DEWSB review, but must follow local safety and human use reviews as required.
   4.2.4. DEW projects with or in the vicinity of nuclear or conventional munitions require
   DEWSB approval and proximity restrictions to prevent inadvertent functioning or damage.
4.3. Informal Acquisition Program Transition to Operations.
   4.3.1. For those informal acquisition DEW projects that desire to transition to normal
   operational use or unsupervised Extended User Evaluations, follow the standard DEW
   certification process and requirements listed in Chapter 3 above. Due to the nature of
   informal acquisition, much of the documentation may not be readily available or will need to
   be developed. The developer PM or equivalent will be responsible for addressing any
   missing information and providing the appropriate documentation for the DEWSB to
   complete its review. The PM shall coordinate with the DEWSB Executive Secretary to
   specify review documentation requirements.
4.4. Information required for DEWSB informal acquisition safety approval: see
Attachment 6.
AFI91-401_AFMCSUP_I 5 MARCH 2014                                                               21


4.5. Test Safety Assessment:
   4.5.1. The DEWSB issues design safety assessments for field testing of uncertified, yet live,
   DEWs listed in Section 1.2.1. DEWSB approval and proximity restrictions must be obtained
   prior to the testing or employment of DEWs with or in the vicinity of nuclear or conventional
   munitions to prevent inadvertent functioning or damage. The captive carriage phase of test
   programs is governed by the USAF SEEK EAGLE Program and may be entered prior to
   DEWSB approval of live- launch or live- fire phases. DEWSB approval is not required for
   tests of new DEWs that are non-functional or in by-pass mode when tested.
   4.5.2. Test hazards are assessed via the THAR conducted during a regular or special
   DEWSB meeting. THAR identified hazards are then evaluated by the RTO during the SRB
   process. An appropriate test approval authority then reviews the hazards and mitigating
   measures and approves the test to proceed or directs further mitigating actions / restrictions.
   Consult AFI 91-205 for instructions to prepare the THAR.
      4.5.2.1. The PM will provide read-ahead information to support identification of test
      hazards at least 14 days prior to conducting a THAR. Such information may be a simple
      point paper for non-complex items or it may be a comprehensive technical data package
      for test weapons that are potentially more hazardous.

                                           Chapter 5

                 DIRECTED ENERGY WEAPONS SAFETY CRITERIA

5.1. DEW Safety Analysis. The safety analysis conducted by the PM, in collaboration with
appropriate subject matter experts, provides decision- makers with a process for identifying and
evaluating data needed to reach conclusions regarding risks from use of a particular DEW. A
comprehensive safety analysis may include modeling, test and evaluation, and an independent
review of the DEW within its context of intended use.
   5.1.1. Requirements. The safety analysis will apply the System Safety process in MIL-STD-
   882E to define DEW program-specific safety criteria.
       5.1.1.1. Determine the hazardous effects of the DEW within the operational
       environment.
       5.1.1.2. Complete a risk assessment, proposed risk mitigation, and analysis of residual
       risk for acceptance.
       5.1.1.3. Consider all safety critical functions, safety critical components, and safety
       critical software of the DEW and its interfaces with the host platform.
       5.1.1.4. (Added-AFMC) ADDEWSR’s will forward a listing of fielded DEW systems
       within their respective organization to their installation or center DEWSO. Insta llation or
       center DEWSO’s will then forward the list to HQ AFMC/SEW. Annual inspections of
       fielded lethal and spot inspections of non- lethal systems will be accomplished by the unit
       and installation or center DEWSO. Inspections will be documented and maintained for 3
       years.
5.2. Hazard Identification. The identification of DEW hazards provides the basis for safety
control implementation.
   5.2.1. Suggested hazards to review/measure. Include other system-specific hazards as
   appropriate. The process of identifying hazards should include potential unintended effects
   of the weapon and potential occupational exposures.
       5.2.1.1. Weapon Power Source.
           5.2.1.1.1. Consider hazards associated with DEW power source.
           5.2.1.1.2. Consider potential hazards to personnel, equipment, and delivery platforms
           hosting the DEW.
           5.2.1.1.3. Consider parking requirements for DEW equipped aircraft and ground
           platforms, if applicable, based on the method of DEW power generation. The power
           generation/conversion could be fuel cell driven, gas turbine power take off, chemical
           mixing, conventional munition driven (flux compression generator), or another
           method. Refer to AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards, for systems using
           explosive components. DEW related hazardous materials will be managed like any
           other similar hazardous material under provisions of applicable safety guidance, (e.g.
           AFI 32-7086 and/or AFJMAN 23-209). AFOSH-STD 48-9 applies to electro-
           magnetic frequency and electric hazards.
AFI91-401_AFMCSUP_I 5 MARCH 2014                                                           23

        throughout propagation path and interaction with target.
        5.2.1.3.2. Consider radiofrequency energy interference, ionizing radiation, and sensor
        oversaturation resulting in potential fratricide.
     5.2.1.4. Weapon Accuracy Effects.
        5.2.1.4.1. Effects due to beam drifting, failure to achieve pointing accuracy, and
        failure to maintain pointing stability.
     5.2.1.5. Personnel and Equipment Effects Due to Weapon Exposure.
        5.2.1.5.1. Health and safety risks to personnel from direct and indirect weapons
        effects.
        5.2.1.5.2. Risks of impacting infrastructure and legacy systems. Includes full
        spectrum of impact from temporarily disrupting operations to permanently damaging
        equipment.
        5.2.1.5.3. Potentially hazardous DEW effects to ordnance or fuel.
     5.2.1.6. Maintenance and Storage.
        5.2.1.6.1. Review the potential hazards such as inadvertent chemical release, high
        pressure systems, electrical discharges, electromagnetic pulses, and confined space
        issues.
        5.2.1.6.2. Consider potential hazards such as transporting, handling, interoperability
        with existing infrastructure and legacy systems, chemical venting, and safety
        perimeters.
     5.2.1.7. Transportation.
        5.2.1.7.1. Identify any hazards of system components in shipping, transport, or cruise
        configuration.
     5.2.1.8. DEW Handling and System Operation.
        5.2.1.8.1. Identify potential hazards from DEW handling and system operations such
        as chemical exposures, high pressure systems, electrical discharge, high voltage,
        wave guide leakage, noise, and confined space entry. These hazards would be
        encountered during the day-to-day operation of the system.
     5.2.1.9. End of Life/Disposal.
 24                                                  AFI91-401_AFMCSUP_I 5 MARCH 2014


          5.2.1.9.1. Review potential safety issues for end of system life such as disposal of
          chemical containment systems and hazardous system components such as lasers
          exempt from FDA safety regulations.
5.3. Risk Assessment. The intent of the risk assessment is to evaluate hazards based on
information gathered during the hazardous effects identification and achieve the appropriate
level of risk mitigation or acceptance.
   5.3.1. Determine acceptability of risks IAW MIL-STD-882E.
   5.3.2. Evaluate consequences and uncertainties of the weapon in situations during intended
   use.
   5.3.3. Evaluate consequences and uncertainties of the weapon during live-fire testing.
5.4. Safety Critical Functions and Safety Critical Components.
   5.4.1. Safety critical functions are actions that control the sequence leading to DEW
   activation, directed energy propagation, and subsequent termination. Equipment (hardware
   and/or software) designed to mitigate risk, contain e nergy flows, and specific approved
   procedures must be in place. The design of the DEW will consider the following safety
   critical functions:
       5.4.1.1. Safing. Ensures the DEW is incapable of arming, firing, or initiating the process
       of arming or firing to include initiation of chemical, electrical, or mechanical energy
       related to the arming process.
       5.4.1.2. Targeting. The process of selecting and prioritizing targets and matching the
       appropriate response to them, considering operational requirements and capabilities.
       5.4.1.3. Arming. Prepares the weapon for propagating energy short of the actual firing.
       5.4.1.4. Firing. Used to release directed energy (post arming).
          5.4.1.4.1. Inhibits. Prevents directed energy, side lobe energy, and energy leakage
          into Transmit Inhibit Zones (TIZ).
          5.4.1.4.2. Audible and Visual Caution and Warnings. Indicates to operators when
          powering/operating DEW systems and when disabling DEW safety systems (e.g., TIZ
          inhibits) and engineering controls while energized.
       5.4.1.5. Terminating. Halt directed energy propagation.
       5.4.1.6. Weapon Energy Containment.          Contain weapon energy, control its flow,
       conversion, or delivery.
       5.4.1.7. Monitoring. Provides status of the other safety critical functions.
       5.4.1.8. Transitions between system states. Ensures safe transition from inactive state to
       ready state or training state to ready state.
       5.4.1.9. Any functions designated safety critical by the PM.
   5.4.2. Safety critical components are those components (hardware or software) whose failure
   or fault would compromise safe operation of the entire system. The hazard mitigation and
   control shall be appropriate to the potential hazard of the DEW or its components. Use the
   following guidance to determine which DEW components are safety critical:

      5.4.2.1. A component that controls a safety critical function is a safety critical
      component.
      5.4.2.2. A component that controls a system state transition is a safety critical
      component.
      5.4.2.3. A component whose failure produces a hazard with a catastrophic or critical
      mishap rating IAW MIL-STD-882E is a safety critical component.
      5.4.2.4. Any components designated safety critical by the PM.
5.5. General Safety Requirements.
   5.5.1. Exposure limits. The safety criteria will use, to the maximum extent practical,
   procedures and controls based upon sound radiation protection IAW DoDI 6055.08,
   Occupational Ionizing Radiation Protection Program, DoDI 6055.11, Protecting Personnel
   from Electromagnetic Fields, DoDI 6055.15, DoD Laser Protection Program, AFI 48-148,
   Ionizing Radiation Protection, AFI 48-139, and AFOSH-STD 48-9. Standards for acoustic
   systems can be found in AFOSH-STD 48-20.
      5.5.1.1. Engineering Controls.
          5.5.1.1.1. Engineering controls are the preferred method of controlling hazards. Use
          first and foremost to control hazards of DEW to DoD personnel and local community.
          5.5.1.1.2. Design and build adjustable average power levels as appropriate to mission
          of the DEW.
          5.5.1.1.3. Terminate the beam at the end of its useful path or establish exclusion
          zones commensurate with the expected hazard region surrounding the target.
          5.5.1.1.4. System program managers should consider the suitability of limited
          aerospace and range areas available for training with the DEW and whether a training
          mode is required.
          5.5.1.1.5. Control measures should be implemented to mitigate or reduce hazards
          IAW AFI 90-802, Risk Management, AFI 63-1201, Life Cycle Systems Engineering,
          AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, and MIL-STD-882E.
      5.5.1.2. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
          5.5.1.2.1. Where engineering and other controls are not adequate to mitigate DEW
          hazards/emissions to below Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPE), wear PPE as
          appropriate. Ensure PPE is recommended by and certified through Bioenvironmental
          Engineering (BE). With BE advising, work center provides adequate training on
          wear and limitations of the PPE to all personnel wearing the PPE.
          5.5.1.2.2. The PM must evaluate the effectiveness and make recommendations for
          the safe use of PPE against the DEW emissions or other physical or chemical hazards
          inherent to the system. If adequate PPE doesn’t exist, then the PM should contact
          USAFSAM/OEC and AFRL 711 HPW/RHD to initiate research into appropriate PPE
          or to determine alternate methods to protect personnel if they must be occupationally
          exposed.
      5.5.1.3. Administrative Controls.

        5.5.1.3.1. Training is critical to ensure safe operation of DEW. Personnel must be
        trained prior to using or maintaining DEW systems. See Section 6.2.3.11.3. for
        training topics.
        5.5.1.3.1. (AFMC) Installation or Center DEWSO’s with oversight of DEW system
        will review and approve DEW safety training programs.
        5.5.1.3.2. System documentation including training manuals, TOs, and operating
        checklists can increase user awareness and prevent hazards. To the greatest extent
        possible, hazards and hazardous effects should be identified in system TOs or the
        equivalent and cover use, storage, and maintenance.
        5.5.1.3.3. Use the minimum power level for the application being performed, if
        applicable.
        5.5.1.3.4. Occupational health exam requirements for personnel engaged in DEW
        operations are determined by the base Occupational and Enviro nmental Health
        Working Group IAW AFI 48-145, Occupational and Environmental Health
        Program, AFI 48-148, AFOSH-STD 48-9, and AFI 48-139.
        5.5.1.3.5. Use a “training mode” where applicable to ensure personnel are not
        harmed.
        5.5.1.3.6. If a DEW system is shipped to/from other locations aboard transport
        aircraft or ship, it should be configured in a non-energized system state with
        minimum fuel/chemicals. The hazards in shipping configuration may limit the mode
        of transportation. Establish shipment procedures and safety checklists for use with
        transportation units, as applicable and IAW AFI 32-7086.
     5.5.1.4. Special Controls. This section is not an all- inclusive list, but meant to provide
     examples of additional special controls that may be required, given the type of DEW.
        5.5.1.4.1. Install visual or audible beam-warning devices independent of DEW
        system in areas where personnel may be exposed to radiation in excess of the
        Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPE)/Threshold Limit Value (TLV), when it will
        not compromise the mission. Use appropriate warning signs on all outdoor ranges
        approved for DEW use.
            5.5.1.4.1.1. Install a manually operated audible alarm in each location where
            DEW maintenance and/or testing requires isolation. The alarm must have two
            pull stations or initiation locations in each area (room or maintenance bay) where
            DEW operations occur.
        5.5.1.4.2. Observe high voltage and arc flash safety criteria IAW AFI 91-203.
        5.5.1.4.3. Be aware that ionizing and non- ionizing radiation from source generation
        may exceed allowable limits. Ionizing radiation exposure may require additional
        monitoring IAW AFI 48-148 and AFMAN 48-125, Personnel Ionizing Radiation
        Dosimetry.
        5.5.1.4.4. Use Energy Isolation Devices to isolate (lock out/tag out) energy sources
        prior to the start of inspection, maintenance, or servicing actions until such activities
        are complete IAW AFI 91-203.

     5.5.1.5. Sensor and Electronic Equipment Safety. As appropriate, safety criteria will
     consider creating requirements to protect sensors from damage and other implications on
     electronic equipment IAW Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) 3222.3, DoD
     Electromagnetic Environmental Effects (E3) Program. Methods to protect other systems
     could include operational clear zones, controlling beam widths, sensor hardening, etc.
  5.5.2. Environmental Impact. The safety criteria will consider the environment in areas such
  as: air quality, hazardous materials and waste, noise, water and biological resources, geology,
  and soils IAW 32 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 989, Environmental Impact Analysis
  Process (EIAP).

       accordance with the guidance established in AFOSH-STD 48-9, AFI 48-139, and
       other guidance as appropriate. For those rare cases where, because of the operational
       requirements of a system, the exposure may be above accepted limits, the DEWSO
       must ensure that the appropriate policy exemptions have been obtained (see Section
       A3.10.2.) and that alternative exposure requirements are met. (T-2).
       6.2.7.1.3. Exposures above established limits must be recorded per AFI 48-145 and
       become a part of the individual’s occupational exposure record. (T-2).
       6.2.7.1.4. If intentional exposure to a DEW is above accepted limits, the
       Occupational Health Working Group should be included in the review of the policy
       exemption and exposure plan. Additionally, a medical exam may be required
       immediately following the intentional over-exposure.

Terms
Component—Subsystem, item or element. A component is hardware, software, procedures,
interfaces, or a combination of any of the four.
Damage—Non-transitory upset or burnout of a target sufficient to reduce its operational utility.
Directed Energy—An umbrella term covering technologies that relate to the production of a
beam or field of concentrated electromagnetic energy, atomic or subatomic particles.
Directed Energy Mishap—An Air Force mishap fitting one of the following subcategories:
1) Directed Energy Weapon. A mishap involving a directed energy weapon and/or unique
directed energy weapon support equipment.

2) Directed Energy Device. A mishap involving a directed energy device. An example would be
damage to an optical device by an aircraft laser range finder.
Directed Energy Weapon—A weapon system using directed energy primarily as a direct means
to deny, disrupt, degrade (damage), or destroy enemy equipment, facilities, or personnel. Note
that this differs slightly from the Joint definition by including deny and disrupt in order to cover
additional systems and capabilities.
Emergency Operational Capability—The ability of a system currently under development (a
system with limited capabilities or a limited number of systems) that could be deployed in an
operational mode by warfighters during a crisis situation. The fielding of JSTARS during Desert
Storm is an example.
Ionizing Radiation—Any electromagnetic or particulate radiation capable of producing ions
directly or indirectly in its passage through matter. Ionizing radiation includes gamma rays, X
rays, alpha particles, beta particles, neutrons, protons, and other particles and electromagnetic
waves capable of producing ions.
Maximum Pe rmissible Exposure—(1) The level of laser to which a person may be exposed
without hazardous effect or adverse biological changes in the eye or skin. Laser MPE values for
AFI91-401_AFMCSUP_I 5 MARCH 2014                                                              39


eyes and skin are listed in ANSI Z136.1. Also refer to AFI 48-139. (2) The conservative
threshold for the occurrence of potentially deleterious health effects in humans from
electromagnetic fields. Electromagnetic field exposure standards are listed in IEEE C95.1. Also
refer to AFOSH-STD 48-9.
Modification—All physical and functional configuration changes to existing certified hardware
and software; addition of new equipment; and new operational uses for existing equipment.
Nonionizing Radiation—Any electromagnetic radiation incapable of producing ions directly or
indirectly. Laser energy, microwaves, and radio frequency energy are forms of nonionizing
radiation.
Safety Critical Functions—Functions that control the sequence leading to DEW activation and
subsequent termination, (e.g. Targeting, Arming, Firing, Terminating, Monitoring, etc).
Safety Critical Components—System components that control safety critical functions,
produce extreme hazards, or components whose failure or fault would compromise safe
operation of the entire system.
Safety Critical Software—Those computer software components and units whose errors can
result in a potential hazard, or loss of predictability or control of a system.
System Program Manager—The single individual specifically designated, under the integrated
weapon system management architecture, to be responsible for the life cycle management of a
system or end- item. The system program manager is the person vested with full authority,
responsibility, and resources to execute and support an approved Air Force program.
System States—Control the safety critical functions and prevent the inadvertent or improper
propagation of directed energy by the weapon, (e.g. Inactive, Ready, Active, and Maintenance).
Alternate names and additional states may be employed.
Threshold Limit Value—The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists
establishes limits of occupational exposure to physical agents of acoustic, ergonomic,
mechanical, and thermal nature, that represent conditions under which it is believed that nearly
all workers may be repeatedly exposed day after day, over a working lifetime without adverse
effect. See AFOSHSTD 48-20 for occupational noise guidance.
Weapon Energy—Anything used to power, fuel, or provide energy for a DEW. Any source,
which may be used for both DEW and another activity, becomes weapon energy when it is
loaded and consumed for exclusive DEW use. Examples of weapon energy include chemical,
electrostatic, electrodynamic, explosive, gas, light, or ionizing sources. An example of a source
becoming weapon energy is chemicals that may be used for industrial or DEW use. Certain
ground safety and occupational health standards govern the industrial use of the chemicals;
however, once the chemicals are loaded into a weapon for the sole purpose of providing energy
for beam generation, they become weapon energy. For weapon energy, DEW safety rules take
precedence over other safety rules.

                   DIRECTED ENERGY WEAPONS SAFETY BOARD

A2.1. Purpose. The DEWSB functions as the safety certification authority for program-specific
Directed Energy Weapons (DEW) and conducts assessments, approvals, and certifications
throughout DEW research, development, test and evaluation, production, deployment, and
operational life cycle.
   A2.1.1. For DEW intended for operational use by the AF, the DEWSB:
       A2.1.1.1. Reviews and establishes design safety and qualification test criteria, standards,
       and requirements for DEW and related items.
       A2.1.1.2. Provides guidance to program management authorities throughout the life
       cycle of DEW programs and ensures criteria for safety certification reviews receive
       adequate consideration during the design, development, test and evaluation, and
       operational deployment phases.
       A2.1.1.3. Maintains safety awareness over all new or modified DEW, including those
       developed by the AF, those obtained from other US military services, and those obtained
       from foreign sources.
       A2.1.1.4. Ensures safety certification or approval by another service or government does
       not replace the required DEWSB review and approval. However, certification and
       approval actions conducted jointly with another service’s certification/approval authority
       may satisfy the DEWSB review and approval process.
       A2.1.1.5. Systems approved via AFI 91-205 or other Air Force recognized approval
       processes may be accepted by the DEWSB, provided the DEW portion of the system was
       evaluated. The DEWSB reserves the right to review and approve uncertified, yet live,
       DEWs listed in Section 1.2.1 onboard USAF aircraft, ground platforms, and aircraft not
       in the USAF inventory flown by AF pilots.
   A2.1.2. During the conduct of its safety study and review program, the DEWSB:
       A2.1.2.1. Ensures DEWs are evaluated against AF safety criteria, standards, and
       requirements and evaluations are based on analysis results and data obtained from
       engineering, development, and operational testing.
       A2.1.2.2. Verifies (through results of evaluations) that required level of design and
       performance safety is achieved during all of a DEW item’s life cycle. An item’s life
       cycle includes all phases of development, production, and AF operational use (including
       transportation, handling, maintenance, employment, and disposal) from program
       initiation through item removal from the AF inventory.
       A2.1.2.3. Reviews the safety aspects of DEW operations, when requested by a DEWSB
       member or HAF office, and recommends to the responsible organization actions to
       improve safety or occupational health provisions of the operation.
A2.2. DEWSB Members and Advisory Personnel.
   A2.2.1. DEWSB Members. The DEWSB is comprised of experienced individuals
   designated by their command or agency. Members must have expert knowledge of AF
AFI91-401_AFMCSUP_I 5 MARCH 2014                                                          41


  DEW, related systems, and associated operational safety policies and procedures, and must
  be able to act as AF technical authorities for the purposes of the DEWSB.
     A2.2.1.1. Members must also be knowledgeable of their command’s unique policies,
     procedures and operational limitations and constraints. They will staff within their
     commands or agencies all read-ahead material, resolve differences, and bring command
     positions to the board meetings. In addition, members will thoroughly evaluate each
     study and review documents prior to a DEWSB meeting.
     A2.2.1.2. Members actively participate in all DEWSB meetings. Members present their
     command’s position and strive to resolve all conflicts based on the best interest of the
     AF. Members will arrange for a proxy when attendance at a meeting is not possible.
     When notified of appointment to the DEWSB, a new member will arrange for an
     orientation with the Executive Secretary. This orientation may be done in conjunction
     with a normally scheduled convening of all board members. If this option is used, the
     new member will coordinate his/her orientation with the Executive Secretary at least two
     weeks prior to the meeting.
     A2.2.1.3. Members must possess the authority needed to ensure a comprehensive
     technical review within their command or agency of the safety studies and analyses on
     which DEWSB safety evaluations are based.
     A2.2.1.4. DEWSB membership is composed of one voting representative from each of
     the following commands and agencies:

          A2.2.1.5.2. AFMC/96th Test Wing
          A2.2.1.5.3. PMs
          A2.2.1.5.4. Representatives of other services
          A2.2.1.5.5. USAFSAM
      A2.2.1.6. Program-Specific Technical Advisors. Program-specific technical advisors are
      individuals with expertise uniquely suited to the program’s technical and operational
      specifications. The following areas should typically be represented:
          A2.2.1.6.1. Directed Energy Weapon Safety
          A2.2.1.6.2. Directed Energy Bioeffects
          A2.2.1.6.3. Directed Energy Material Effects
          A2.2.1.6.4. System Operations and Maintenance

          A2.2.1.6.7. As required: includes representatives (e.g. military, government civilians,
          advisory and assistance services contractors, contractors) with expertise deemed
          important by the PM or any of the standing board members.
A2.3. Chairperson and Member Duties.
   A2.3.1. The Chair, or his/her designated representative, presides at DEWSB meetings. For a
   given matter before the Board, the Chair casts a vote only when a ballot of members present
   results in a tie.
      A2.3.1.1. The Chair approves the composition of special ad hoc groups to provide
      DEWSB-related review and advisory services to special access programs.
      A2.3.1.2. If not designated as the Chair, AFSEC/SEW will provide the DEWSB with a
      representative to function as an advisor or consultant to the DEWSB at every meeting.
   A2.3.2. Members from HQ ACC, HQ AFMC, HQ AMC, HQ PACAF, HQ USAFE, and
   AFOTEC constitute a quorum for conducting DEWSB business. Under unusual situations,
   such as a short notice or conflicting requirements, quorum members may delegate their votes
   to another quorum member (proxy), provided the proxy member and the DEWSB Chair
   agree to the delegation. When the DEWSB reviews DEW where operational use is limited to
   other commands (e.g., HQ AFSOC), the members from those commands will be included in
   the quorum requirements.
      A2.3.2.1. Individual DEWSB members may invite advisors and consultants, and will
      notify the Executive Secretary of those attendees well in advance of the meeting.
   A2.3.3. Advisory Personnel. Advisory personnel are invited to attend DEWSB meetings, as
   required. At times, attendance by such advisors may be essential to the effective conduct of
   DEWSB business. Advisors do not exercise a vote during the formal proceedings. If the
   membership holds that inadequate advisory expertise is present to allow proper evaluation of
   DEWs, then at the discretion of the Chair, review of the item may be postponed until a
   subsequent meeting.
AFI91-401_AFMCSUP_I 5 MARCH 2014                                                              43


   A2.3.4. If the Chair, the Executive Secretary, or member anticipates that operational
   limitations may be imposed as a condition of certification of DEWs for operational use, the
   Executive Secretary will advise the affected organization requesting DEWSB review. In
   addition, that organization will request participation by one or more advisory representatives
   of the affected AF Secretariat or Air Staff offices.
   A2.3.5. The DEWSB may conduct joint reviews with the weapons safety certification bodies
   of other services for joint development programs. Joint reviews will normally be co-chaired,
   and can include participation of members from multiple Services. The DEWSB, however,
   reserves the prerogative to deliberate separately on a particular issue to achieve an AF
   position. Joint meeting minutes may also serve as official DEWSB minutes.
A2.4. Executive Secretary Duties.
   A2.4.1. Serves as the principal administrative assistant and key advisor to the Chair and
   Board members for conducting DEWSB affairs.
   A2.4.2. Consults with the AF procuring organizations, program offices, managers, or other
   agencies, as necessary, to clarify requirements specified in this instruction.
   A2.4.3. Informs the Chair about DEWSB activities and issues that might affect DEWSB
   proceedings.
   A2.4.4. Maintains a list of appointed DEWSB members and alternates and provides the
   administrative services necessary to conduct DEWSB meetings. He/she also provides new
   member orientation.
   A2.4.5. Interacts with the Chair, members, AF procuring/modifying agencies, system
   program offices, or other agencies, as necessary, to ensure the effectiveness of the DEWSB
   safety review processes.
   A2.4.6. Maintains up-to-date preparation         instructions   for   technical     read-ahead
   documentation and DEWSB presentations.
   A2.4.7. Notifies the appropriate program management authorities of a change in certification
   status of DEWs when the AF/SE or a staff agency disapproves a DEWSB recommendation
   on certification or non-certification.
   A2.4.8. Takes the following actions to schedule meetings authorized by the Chair.
      A2.4.8.1. Issues meeting announcements at least 30 days in advance of regularly
      scheduled meetings.
      A2.4.8.2. Polls Board members to determine their availability when the need for a

A2.5. Administrative Procedures.
   A2.5.1. DEWSB meetings are held at least annually. Special meetings may be called to
   support time-critical acquisition program activities. Meetings of the DEWSB will be
   scheduled only by the Chair or his/her representative; generally not to exceed once each
   quarter. The Chair will decide on a case-by-case basis if the amount of DEWSB business
   warrants scheduling additional meetings. In addition to these regular DEWSB meetings,
   special meetings may be held when required to support time-critical DEW development
   program milestones.
      A2.5.1.1. The DEWSB (members and advisory personnel) will meet in formal session
      when called by the Chair, or designated acting chairperson. The chair may authorize a
      virtual meeting (such as a video conference) to meet operational needs of participants.
      A2.5.1.2. The Executive Secretary provides meeting notification at least 30 days in
      advance of a regularly scheduled meeting date.
      A2.5.1.3. If a quorum member is not represented and proxy is unavailable, the Chair
      determines if the meeting will proceed with available members.
      A2.5.1.4. For special meetings, the Executive Secretary informs the requesting agency
      that funding of the Board members’ and Chair’s travel expenses will be a condition for
      conducting the special meeting. The Executive Secretary polls members as to their
      availability before final special meeting dates are established.
   A2.5.2. Protocol.
      A2.5.2.1. Members will make a concerted effort to reach unanimous agreement for each
      matter requiring a Board position.
      A2.5.2.2. When unanimous agreement is not possible, the majority position is
      established by open ballot of the members.
      A2.5.2.3. The Chair casts a vote only when a ballot of the members present (including
      proxy votes) results in a tie.
      A2.5.2.4. Members representing the minority position may, at their discretion, prepare a
      minority report for inclusion in the official meeting minutes.
   A2.5.3. Presentations.
      A2.5.3.1. All items appearing in a DEWSB meeting agenda will be supported by a
      structured presentation. The presentation is intended to answer questions arising during
      documentation review and to stimulate detailed discussions.
46                                               AFI91-401_AFMCSUP_I 5 MARCH 2014


     A2.5.3.2. Agencies preparing DEWSB presentations should ensure essential supporting
     personnel (e.g., AF program management authorities, contractor representatives, etc.) are
     present to participate as needed during the presentation and discussions.
     A2.5.3.3. The Executive Secretary provides appropriate guidance to agencies charged
     with preparing and delivering DEWSB presentations.
  A2.5.4. Meeting Minutes, Studies, and Board Actions.
     A2.5.4.1. Minutes.      For each meeting, document DEWSB proceedings with a
     comprehensive set of minutes. For each item under review, the minutes will include
     applicable findings, recommendations, and required additional actions. In addition, the
     Chair designates a primary action agency for items under review.
         A2.5.4.1.1. DEWSB minutes certify DEWs studied are acceptable or not acceptable
         for further testing or use from a design safety viewpoint. When the minutes are
         signed by each member and approved by the Chair, they become the official DEWSB
         position. If unanimity cannot be achieved, minority reports may be prepared by the
         dissenting members and made a part of the official minutes.
         A2.5.4.1.2. DEWSB meeting minutes constitute interim fulfillment of
         approval/certification of DEWs requirements and grant interim safety approval or
         certification for DEWs or related items. If a staff agency disagrees with meeting
         minutes, the Executive Secretary will notify applicable commanders of disapproval
         and/or subsequent modification, if required, of interim approval or certification.
         A2.5.4.1.3. Commanders may proceed with DEW operations based                       on
         recommendations in DEWSB meeting minutes, pending HAF concurrence.
         A2.5.4.1.4. The Executive Secretary finalizes meeting minutes. Also, the Executive
         Secretary submits the entire report to AFSEC/SEW to initiate the AF/SE and AF staff
         agency approval process.
         A2.5.4.1.5. Signed DEWSB minutes, with relevant findings and recommendations,
         are forwarded to AFSEC/SEW, 9700 G Ave SE, Kirtland AFB NM 87117-5670.
         AFSEC/SEW acts as the coordinating agency to obtain staff agency review and
         approval.
         A2.5.4.1.6. As appropriate, the Executive Secretary notifies program management
         authorities, test organizations, and unit commanders to proceed with planned
         activities and operations based on DEWSB’s recommendations. If a staff agency
         disapproves a DEWSB recommendation, the Executive Secretary will notify
         concerned agencies of the change in certification status.
     A2.5.4.2. Studies. Once notified of AF/SE approval, the Executive Secretary publishes
     the report in its final version and distributes it to DEWSB members and associates,
     agencies responsible for implementing DEWSB recommendations, and other interested
     organizations.
         A2.5.4.2.1. Approval of a recommendation to develop or modify a system signifies
         staff agency awareness that such action would be desirable from a safety viewpoint.
         It does not mean that such an action will be officially proposed, initiated, or funded
AFI91-401_AFMCSUP_I 5 MARCH 2014                                                           47


        by a staff agency as a direct result of the recommendation. This is the primary
        responsibility of the action agency.
        A2.5.4.2.2. After a study is approved by HAF, the DEWSB’s recommendations (as
        documented in the meeting minutes) are directive on the designated action agency.
        The action agency initiates and monitors action on the recommendations and makes
        periodic status reports to the Executive Secretary of the DEWSB until final action
        item closeout.
     A2.5.4.3. Action Items. Once DEWSB meeting minutes are approved, actions to
     implement Board recommendations are monitored until completion. Action items will be
     tracked until closure.
        A2.5.4.3.1. The Executive Secretary periodically requests action item completion
        status reports from designated action agencies.
        A2.5.4.3.2. The Executive Secretary arranges for action item status reports at each
        regularly scheduled DEWSB meeting.
        A2.5.4.3.3. The DEWSB determines when a recommended action item has been
        successfully completed.
        A2.5.4.3.4. The DEWSB may delegate to the Executive Secretary the authority to
        close purely administrative action items or to close a given action item upon the
        completion of a specific event (for example, the publication of a technical order).
        A2.5.4.3.5. When all action items related to DEW certification have been closed,
        final certification of a DEW item is granted. Final certification is documented in the
        minutes of the DEWSB meeting effecting closure.
