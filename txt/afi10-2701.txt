                                           Chapter 1

                     GENERAL OVERVIEW AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Overview. CAP is a federally supported, congressionally chartered non-profit corporation
that may be utilized as a civilian volunteer auxiliary of the Air Force. The Secretary of the Air
Force (SECAF) can employ the services of CAP in lieu of or to supplement Air Force resources
to fulfill the non-combat programs and missions of the Air Force. Such services may include,
but are not limited to, Air Force-assigned missions (AFAMs) in support of homeland security
operations, consequence management, and other civil support. Certain CAP cadet and aerospace
education programs may also be approved and assigned as AFAMs. When performing AFAMs,
CAP functions as an auxiliary of the Air Force. CAP is not authorized to perform AFAMs
outside of the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands
without specific authorization from the Deputy Chief of Staff (DCS) of the Air Force for
Operations, Plans, and Requirements (AF/A3/5), on behalf of the SECAF. Paragraph 2.2
provides additional guidance.
     1.1.1. Air Force Policy and Oversight. The following organizations are responsible for
     establishing policy and providing advice, liaison, and oversight of CAP:
        1.1.1.1. Secretariat of the Air Force. The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for
        Manpower and Reserve Affairs (SAF/MR), on behalf of the Secretary of the Air Force, is
        responsible for strategic guidance and policy oversight of CAP and CAP organizational
        and governance matters, to include providing guidance and oversight to the CAP Board
        of Governors (BOG).
     1.1.2. Headquarters Air Force. AF/A3/5, on behalf of the Secretary of the Air Force and the
     Air Force Chief of Staff, is responsible for providing policy, guidance, oversight, resource
     advocacy, and Air Force support to CAP. AF/A3/5 signs and approves all interservice and
     interagency Memoranda of Understanding/Agreements (MOU/MOAs) for the use of CAP
     assets as the AF Auxiliary. Once a Memorandum of Understanding or Agreement is
     approved by AF/A3/5, annual interagency/interservice agreements may be approved by the
     Civil Air Patrol-United States Air Force (CAP-USAF) Commander. For agreements of
     limited scope/time (i.e. research, test and development of new equipment) or where no
     funding is transferred to the Cooperative Agreement, AF/A3O-AM may permit CAP-
     USAF/CC to sign the agreement instead of AF/A3/5.
        1.1.2.1. Program Element Monitor. AF/A3O-AM, Global Mobility and Homeland
        Operations Division, Air Force Auxiliary (AFAUX) Requirements and Integration
        Branch, serves as the primary Headquarters Air Force office for CAP matters and is the
        Air Force Program Element Monitor (PEM) for CAP. This single point of contact for the
        CAP Program Element (PE) advises the AF Corporate Structure through the assigned
        Mission Panel on funding requirements and history of the CAP PEs. The CAP PEM will
        develop and coordinate funding requirements with Air Education and Training
        Command, HQ Air University (AU), CAP, and CAP-USAF representatives prior to
        submission.
     1.1.3. Core Function Lead Integrator. Air Combat Command (ACC) is the Core Function
     Lead Integrator (CFLI) for Personnel Recovery (PR) in which the CAP portfolio resides.
AFI10-2701 31 JULY 2014                                                                      5


  The CFLI will balance risk with available resources within the PR core function when
  advising the AF Corporate Structure on CAP issues related to PR.
  1.1.4. Air Education and Training Command (AETC). AETC will have the principal
  MAJCOM-level responsibility for policy, resource advocacy, and oversight of Air Force
  support to CAP. HQ AETC, through HQ AU and the Jeanne M. Holm Center for Officer
  Accessions and Citizen Development (Holm Center), will provide administrative, legal, and
  programmatic support and staff assistance to CAP-USAF, which provides the day-to-day
  oversight.
     1.1.4.1. Grants Officer. AFICA/KT will, in writing, appoint a Grants Officer (from
     338th Specialized Contracting Squadron) and Administrative Grants Officer (from 42
     Contracting Squadron) to execute the Cooperative Agreement (CA). The Grants Officer
     and Administrative Grants Officer will administer the CA and Statement of Work (SOW)
     in accordance with DoD 3210.6-R, Department of Defense Grant and Agreement
     Regulations (DoDGARs) and in consultation with the CAP-USAF/CC as the CAP
     Program Manager (PM). The Grants Officer will send copies of all modifications to the
     CA to the PM.
         1.1.4.1.1. Cooperative Agreement between CAP and the Air Force. The Air Force
         will use a CA and accompanying SOW to define the working relationships between
         the Air Force and CAP. The CA may be modified, renewed, renegotiated, or
         terminated by either the Air Force or CAP in accordance with DoDGARs.
            1.1.4.1.1.1. Substantial Modifications. The Grants Officer must secure the
            concurrence of AF/A3/5, AF/JAA, SAF/MRR, and SAF/GCI (including
            coordination with other offices within SAF/GC, as appropriate) prior to approving
            substantial modifications to the CA. Additionally, substantial modifications
            include authorizations for CAP activities that constitute any significant departure
            from the procedures set forth in this Instruction or the CA. Substantial
            modifications also require the approval of CAP-USAF/CC and CAP/CC.
            1.1.4.1.1.2. Minor Modifications. The Administrative Grants Officer is delegated
            Air Force approval authority for minor modifications for the purpose of funding
            day-to-day operations. An example of a minor modification is a modification for
            adding funding for AFAMs. Prior to approval, all minor modifications must be
            coordinated through and approved by CAP-USAF/CC or CAP-USAF/CV. CAP-
            USAF will obtain appropriate legal reviews. Grants Officer will be on the
            distribution for all minor modifications. When in doubt as to degree of
            modification, minor or substantial, the Grants Officer will make the
            determination. Annual continuations of the agreement will be executed by the
            Grants Officer only. (T-2).
     1.1.4.2. Budget Approval Process. AETC/CC (or the designee at AETC) is responsible
     for approving the CAP financial plan and unfunded requirements list. AU/CC, when
     acting as AETC/ED, Director of Education, following a line-item review of the CAP
     budget, may authorize funding for the CAP Cadet Program and the CAP Aerospace
     Education Program on behalf of the SECAF, in accordance with 10 U.S.C. § 9444
     (b)(11)(B) and (b)(12).
 6                                                                  AFI10-2701 31 JULY 2014


        1.1.4.3. Air University. 42d Air Base Wing will have Numbered Air Force (NAF) level
        command responsibility for policy, resource advocacy, and oversight of Air Force
        support to the CAP. 42d Air Base Wing Public Affairs (PA) supports HQ CAP/PA in the
        dissemination of routine Air Force-related CAP press releases to all Air Force news
        organizations as well as the national mainstream media.
            1.1.4.3.1. Civil Air Patrol – United States Air Force. CAP-USAF is the Air Force
            program office for the CA and the SOW. CAP-USAF is responsible for ensuring that
            CAP is organized, trained, and equipped to fulfill AFAMs and provides day-to-day
            support, advice, liaison and oversight for CAP programs, with particular emphasis on
            safety and programmatic requirements. The CAP-USAF/CC is the PM. CAP-USAF
            personnel are the primary functional interface between other federal agencies and the
            CAP. CAP-USAF is responsible for reviewing CAP’s annual budget and program
            submission and making recommendations through AU/FM or AU/A5/8P to
            AETC/A8 and the HQ AF PEM for funds to support the CAP program.
               1.1.4.3.1.1. Program Management Reviews. CAP-USAF will be responsible for
               coordinating Program Management Reviews (PMRs) that will be held at least
               once every two years (unless otherwise directed in writing by Headquarters Air
               Force) and will include representatives from AF/A3O-AM, AETC, AU, CAP-
               USAF, SAF/MRR, and CAP (T-3). Review of programmatic requirements,
               updates to execution of CAP’s mission, and other issues impacting the program
               will be discussed.
     1.1.5. Air Force Installation Responsibilities. Air Force installations that use CAP to
     accomplish non-combat missions will coordinate regulations, policies, plans, MOU/MOA
     and programs for use of CAP with CAP-USAF. (T-2).
1.1.6. Board of Governors. In accordance with 10 U.S.C. § 9447, the CAP BOG is the
governing body of the CAP Corporation. The BOG is responsible for the effective, efficient, and
proper leadership of the corporation, subject to requirements of law and federal regulation,
including the Air Force Policy Directive 10-27, Civil Air Patrol and AFI 10-2702, Board of
Governors of the Civil Air Patrol.
1.2. Capabilities. CAP conducts three primary programs: Emergency Services and Civil
Support, Aerospace Education, and Cadet Programs. CAP may conduct Emergency Services
and Civil Support activities as a corporation in support of non-federal agencies. When approved
and assigned by the SECAF (or the designee), CAP may conduct these missions as an auxiliary
of the Air Force to support federal agencies, and non-federal agencies when a federal interest
exists. With the exception of cadet orientation flights, as a general rule, Aerospace Education
and Cadet Program activities are not AFAMs.
     1.2.1. Emergency Services and Civil Support. CAP maintains the capability to meet Air
     Force requirements to assist federal, state, local agencies, and non-governmental
     organizations (NGOs) during routine and emergency situations. This capability includes
     aircraft, vehicles, communications equipment, and a force of trained volunteers. The Air
     Force may utilize CAP to support law enforcement agencies in accordance with applicable
     laws and regulations, including AFI 10-801, Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA);
     DODI 3025.21, Defense Support of Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies; the Posse
     Comitatus Act (18 U.S.C. § 1385); and Chapter 18 of Title 10, United States Code (10
AFI10-2701 31 JULY 2014                                                                            7


  U.S.C. §§ 371- 382). The Emergency Services program of CAP is the primary mechanism
  by which CAP supports the Air Force in accomplishing AFAMs. CAP also maintains the
  capability to respond to requests from state, tribal territorial, local authorities and NGOs in its
  capacity as a corporation.
     1.2.1.1. Aircraft. CAP maintains a fleet of several hundred aircraft, comprised mostly of
     Cessna 172, 182, and 206; and GA-8 high-wing, single-engine light aircraft. These
     aircraft are well suited for flying associated with aerial damage assessment, courier
     operations, and search and rescue. Under certain circumstances, CAP also has access to
     member-owned/furnished aircraft, many being of the same or similar types as CAP-
     owned aircraft that can be called upon as part of the CAP aircraft resources, when made
     available by their owners and when the conditions of paragraph 3.6. have been met. CAP
     also maintains a small fleet of gliders. The gliders are used for orientation flights and
     flight training in promoting the Aerospace Education program.
     1.2.1.2. Sensors. CAP utilizes a variety of Aerial Digital Reconnaissance Systems
     (ADRS) that allow aircrews to either carry back or transmit imagery direct to customers
     in near real-time. CAP also possesses sensors for tracking locator beacons during search
     and rescue missions.
     1.2.1.3. Vehicles. CAP maintains a fleet of several hundred vehicles of passenger vans,
     sedans, and pick-up trucks suited for light transportation of personnel and equipment,
     mobile communications units, and ground damage assessment. Most vehicles are
     equipped with radios able to communicate with CAP aircraft and other ground-based
     CAP stations.
     1.2.1.4. Communications. CAP maintains a nationwide communications capability
     including high frequency (HF), very high frequency (VHF) AM, and VHF-FM fixed,
     mobile, and repeater systems.           CAP operates national, regional, and local
     communications networks to provide appropriate levels of connectivity during national,
     regional, or local emergencies or major disasters. The size and composition of the CAP
     communications network enables it to withstand damage from natural or man-made
     disasters and continue to operate during disaster/emergency situations.
  1.2.1.5. Personnel. The CAP membership constitutes a trained force of personnel capable
  of responding to national, regional, and local emergencies or major disasters. Attachment 2
  describes the CAP grade structure. CAP membership is divided into two main categories:
  volunteer cadet members and volunteer senior members. CAP senior members are the
  primary personnel to respond to emergencies or disasters. The senior member professional
  development program prepares the CAP civilian volunteers to render assistance to local,
  state, or federal government, including the armed forces, during emergencies or disasters and
  assistance to the Air Force in accomplishing non-combat programs and missions. A paid
  support staff assists CAP volunteers.
  1.2.2. Aerospace Education. CAP aerospace education programs will provide educational
  materials for both senior and cadet members (Internal) and the general public (External).
  The purpose is to educate both audiences on the value and importance of aviation and
  maintaining aerospace supremacy.
8                                                                    AFI10-2701 31 JULY 2014


       1.2.2.1. Internal Program. This program will promote an understanding of flight,
       military and civilian aviation, aircraft and space vehicle power plants, navigation,
       weather, and air traffic control. The program will emphasize the social, political, and
       economic impacts of aerospace.
       1.2.2.2. External Program. This program will be oriented toward public, private, and
       home schools as well as other youth development organizations. CAP will provide
       teachers with a broad general knowledge of aerospace activities to incorporate aerospace
       education into school curricula. Workshops may be used to provide educational
       materials, speakers, orientation flights, and scholarships.
    1.2.3. Cadet Program. This program’s focus will be to motivate American youth to become
    responsible citizens through aviation-centered activities. Activities will emphasize aerospace
    education, leadership skills, physical fitness, and character development while
    simultaneously providing services to the Air Force, the local community, state, and the
    nation.
       1.2.3.1. Achievement Program. An Achievement Program will be established to ensure
       cadet accomplishments are highlighted and rewarded. Specific requirements in aerospace
       education, leadership skills, physical fitness, and educational values must be
       accomplished before a cadet receives credit for each achievement. Written and
       performance tests must be accomplished for each achievement and comprehensive tests
       must be accomplished to receive credit for completing the program. The program may be
       used to issue cadet promotions and awards/decorations.
       1.2.3.2. Activities. The CAP Cadet Program may conduct a variety of local, state,
       regional, and national level activities designed to provide cadets with exposure to general
       aviation, flight training, aerospace careers, leadership, and character development.
       1.2.3.3. Drug Demand Reduction (DDR). The CAP DDR program is a component of the
       CAP Cadet Program’s character element. To complement the Air Force’s DDR program,
       CAP promotes the drug-free ethic through DDR-themed activities to its entire cadet
       corps, regardless of the cadets’ proximity to military installations. The CAP DDR
       program will promote and support education, community involvement, social
       responsibility, and respect for individuals. It also will enhance similar efforts by the Air
       Force to support the “Air Force Family” by targeting its DDR outreach efforts to
       communities located within 75 miles of Air Force installations, thereby having a positive
       effect on military dependents’ attitudes towards drug use.
    1.2.4. Additional Capabilities.
       1.2.4.1. Chaplains. 10 U.S.C. § 9446 states, “The Secretary of the Air Force may use the
       services of [CAP] chaplains in support of the Air Force active duty and reserve
       component forces to the extent and under conditions that the Secretary determines
       appropriate.” CAP chaplains will meet the same educational and ecclesiastical
       requirements as Air Force Chaplains and will be approved, in writing, by their religious
       bodies to perform volunteer chaplain duties for the DOD and federal agencies. When
       acting pursuant to an AFAM, CAP Chaplain duties are limited to those of Air Force
       Chaplains. (Refer to Table 2.1, Note 2 and paragraphs 1.2.4.1.1. and 1.2.4.1.2. of this
       Instruction for additional information and mission assignment procedures).
AFI10-2701 31 JULY 2014                                                                      9


         1.2.4.1.1. Chaplain Assistance to USAF Chaplain Program. CAP chaplains may
         provide direct volunteer assistance to Air Force Wing Chaplains (including Active,
         Reserve and Guard components) in accordance with AFI 52-101, Planning and
         Organizing. Under these unique circumstances, requests for CAP support as an
         AFAM will be submitted to the appropriate approval authority for the mission IAW
         Table 2.1, through the CAP National Operations Center (NOC), see Attachment 3 for
         contact information. For AFAM requests in support of single, isolated, limited-scope
         events, such as a temporary augmentation of an Air Force Wing Chaplain staff, the
         CAP-USAF/CC, or designee, is the approval authority. For all other instances, the
         appropriate MAJCOM/NAF is the approval authority. See Table 2.1. and
         accompanying notes.
         1.2.4.1.2. Chaplain Assistance to DOD and other Federal Agencies. CAP chaplains
         serving exclusively under the authority of CAP in its corporate capacity may provide
         chaplain, ministerial, and counseling services through direct volunteer assistance to,
         and in support of state, tribal, territorial and local authorities, and NGOs. However
         when acting pursuant to an AFAM (e.g. providing services to DOD and other federal
         agencies), a CAP Chaplain's duties are limited to those authorized by AF/HC for Air
         Force Chaplains. Examples of such assistance may include base chaplain services, as
         well as chaplain/support services approved in response to operational missions, such
         as disaster relief activities.
     1.2.4.2. Traumatic Stress Response (TSR). CAP personnel who meet TSR qualifications
     as set forth by the Air Force may be assigned to provide stress management in support of
     AFAMs. Prior to requesting CAP personnel to provide TSR services in support of an
     AFAM, the Air Force installation/wing commander or MAJCOM Integrated Delivery
     System (IDS), as appropriate, must validate the need for and endorse CAP participation
     in such TSR activities. (T-3). Requests for CAP support as an AFAM will be submitted
     to the appropriate approval authority for the mission IAW Table 2.1, through the CAP
     NOC. Refer to AFI 44-153, Traumatic Stress Response or AFI 52-104, Chaplain Corps
     Readiness for more information. This paragraph applies to TSR activities in support of
     AFAMs and does not restrict CAP from providing TSR support to CAP members.
  1.2.5. CAP Status as an Auxiliary of the Air Force. 10 U.S.C. § 9442 identifies CAP as an
  auxiliary of the Air Force when its services are used by any department or agency in any
  branch of the federal government, including the Air Force. CAP is deemed to be an
  instrumentality of the United States while carrying out missions assigned by the Secretary.
     1.2.5.1. Non-combat Missions. Non-combat missions are tasked to the Air Force by
     statute, regulation, or higher authority and do not involve actual combat, combat
     operations, or combat training. The Air Force may use the services of CAP in lieu of or
     in addition to Air Force resources to accomplish Air Force missions. CAP may provide
     limited combat training support such as radar calibration, simulated aerial targets, and
     Surrogate Predator type missions. CAP cadets are permitted to participate in career
     orientation training programs, to include combat oriented training programs.
     1.2.5.2. Air Force Assigned Missions (AFAMs).       Non-combat missions, when
     authorized and assigned to CAP by the SECAF, or the designee, are deemed to be
     AFAMs. All AFAMs will be executed under military command and control, generally at
 10                                                                AFI10-2701 31 JULY 2014


       the operational level. In some instances, the Air Force will exercise general tactical
       direction of CAP assets and personnel during the performance of AFAMs. The Air Force
       agency which approves the mission, on behalf of the SECAF and in accordance with
       Table 2.1. of this Instruction, will exercise command and control unless otherwise
       directed by higher HQ. See paragraph 2.2.1. for AFAM criteria.
1.3. Status of CAP Personnel. CAP is not a military service, its members are not subject to the
Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and CAP membership does not confer upon an
individual any of the rights, privileges, prerogatives or benefits of military personnel, active,
reserve, or retired. Although CAP is not a military service, it uses an Air Force-style grade
structure and its members may wear Air Force-style uniforms when authorized, but Air Force
protocol, customs and courtesies do not apply to CAP members. 10 U.S.C. § 9442 states the
CAP shall be deemed to be an instrumentality of the United States with respect to any act or
omission of the CAP, including any member of the CAP, in carrying out a mission assigned by
the SECAF, i.e. AFAMs.
   1.3.1. CAP Grade. The Air Force through the CAP-USAF/CC has authority over the CAP
   grade structure. CAP uses military style grade for its membership at the discretion and
   approval of the CAP-USAF/CC. CAP officer or noncommissioned officer grade does not
   confer commissioned or noncommissioned officer status. CAP personnel have no authority
   over members of the armed forces. CAP members who are active, reserve, and retired
   members of the armed forces will be treated according to their CAP status when acting in a
   CAP capacity.
   1.3.2. Uniform Wear and Personal Appearance. CAP members are authorized to wear CAP
   or Air Force-style uniforms IAW CAP regulations (civilian clothing may be worn when
   specific missions dictate). CAP-USAF/CC controls the configuration of the Air Force-style
   uniform worn by CAP members and must approve of CAP uniforms to ensure they remain
   sufficiently distinct from Air Force-style uniforms.
   1.3.3. Air Force-Style Uniform Wear and Grooming Standards. CAP members who choose
   to wear the Air Force-style uniform must maintain appearance and grooming standards
   comparable to the Air Force standards, IAW AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance
   of Air Force Personnel. When wearing the Air Force-style uniform, all CAP members are
   required to present a professional military image. Members who do not meet these standards
   are restricted from wearing the Air Force-style uniform but are not barred from membership
   or active participation in CAP. In these circumstances, members may only wear authorized
   non-Air Force-style CAP uniforms or civilian attire as appropriate. Variations in these
   standards are subject to CAP-USAF/CC approval.
   1.3.4. CAP Distinctive Uniforms and Insignia. The emblems, insignia, and badges of the
   CAP Air Force-style uniform will clearly identify an individual as a CAP member at a
   distance and in low-light conditions. CAP-USAF/CC must approve changes to the CAP Air
   Force-style uniform. CAP uniforms must be sufficiently different from U.S. Armed Forces
   uniforms so that confusion will not occur.
   1.3.5. CAP Membership Card. CAP members carry Membership Cards identifying them as
   members of the organization. CAP Membership Cards must meet Air Force standards and
   are considered a uniform item subject to the same approval process as other parts of the CAP
   uniform. The CAP Membership Card must be sufficiently different from U.S. Armed Forces
AFI10-2701 31 JULY 2014                                                                            11


   identification card so that confusion will not occur. CAP Membership Cards do not qualify
   for Federal Aviation Administration identification requirements concerning pilot certificate
   privileges. CAP Wing Commanders, with the assistance of the CAP-USAF Liaison Region
   representatives, will work with AF Installation Commanders to determine the level of access
   for CAP members to each installation. Agreements will be documented and retained by the
   CAP-USAF Liaison Region representative. (T-3). Installation Commanders are encouraged
   to notify CAP-USAF/CC when removal or debarment action is taken against a CAP member.
   1.3.6. Security Clearances. AFAMs may require CAP personnel to have eligibility to access
   classified information and a security clearance. The requesting agency will determine
   security clearance requirements for their AFAM and will be responsible for the costs to
   obtain any new clearances associated with the AFAM request. All requirements to include
   number and levels of security clearances will be validated and approved by AU/CC prior to
   submitting any members for investigation. CAP members who have valid and current
   security clearance eligibility from military or government service may use them when
   performing AFAMs.
1.4. Air Force Authority and Control. In accordance with 10 U.S.C. §§ 9441-9448 the
SECAF, or his designee, may regulate and impose limitations on CAP.
   1.4.1. Conduct of Air Force Assigned Missions. The Air Force has authority over the
   conduct of all AFAMs, including the authority to extend, modify, suspend, and/or terminate
   such missions.
   1.4.2. Resources. The Air Force, through the CAP-USAF/CC, has the authority to stop
   CAP’s receipt of federal funds, IAW any statute, regulation, the CA, or the SOW.
   1.4.3. CAP Corporate Activities. The Air Force will regulate and oversee those corporate
   activities that are financed with appropriated funds, employ assets procured with
   appropriated funds, or otherwise involve activities that could give the appearance of
   endorsement of the action by the Air Force or could be detrimental to the federal
   government.
   1.4.4. Regulations. The Air Force, through CAP-USAF/CC, has authority to review and
   approve CAP’s corporate regulations, policies, plans, and programs which govern AFAMs,
   safety and CAP’s use of federally provided resources, prior to implementation by CAP. CAP
   regulations, policies, plans, and programs shall not be construed as authority to conduct
   missions not otherwise authorized under this Instruction or to deviate from procedures set
   forth herein.
1.5. Actions on Military Installations. When on military installations or other government
facilities, CAP personnel will adhere to the regulations and policies of the installation or facility.
Installation or facility commanders may remove or bar entry of individual CAP members IAW
established procedures.
1.6. CAP Responsibilities to the Air Force. CAP is responsible for ensuring it can carry out
AFAMs.
   1.6.1. General CAP Responsibilities. CAP is responsible for developing CAP regulations,
   policies, plans, and programs to govern the safety, training, qualification, conduct, and
   performance of all CAP personnel in the accomplishment of AFAMs as well as non-AFAM
 12                                                                AFI10-2701 31 JULY 2014


   activities as required by the CA and SOW (i.e. Career Exploration Courses). All CAP
   regulations, policies, plans, and programs to govern the safety, training, qualification,
   conduct, and performance will be approved by the CAP-USAF/CC.
   1.6.2. Training to Perform Air Force-Assigned Missions. To ensure mission capability, CAP
   will maintain an Air Force-approved training program that provides a sufficient number of
   qualified personnel to perform AFAMs effectively.
1.7. Air Force CAP Program Manager. As the program manager, CAP-USAF/CC is
responsible for:
   1.7.1. The overall program definition, evaluation, and day-to-day monitoring of the
   execution of the program. The Program Manager establishes measures of program
   performance. (T-1).
   1.7.2. Functional interface between other federal agencies and CAP, including developing
   MOUs and/or MOAs with other federal agencies. The program manager is not authorized to
   enter into or sign such agreements on behalf of the Air Force. AF/A3/5 is the signature
   authority for MOAs/MOUs. However CAP-USAF/CC may approve annual extensions of
   MOAs/MOUs previously approved by AF/A3/5 (see paragraph 1.1.2), absent provision to the
   contrary in the individual MOA/MOU or elsewhere.
   1.7.3. Using his/her authority to temporarily suspend operations for safety or funding
   shortfalls. This authority may be delegated to subordinate CAP-USAF personnel.
   1.7.4. Review and coordination on all CAP regulations and instructions to ensure
   compliance with this Instruction, the CA, the SOW and the responsibilities of the CAP to the
   Air Force. CAP-USAF/CC, or higher authority, may disapprove any or all portions of such
   CAP regulations and instructions that are inconsistent with federal interests, including, but
   not limited to, inconsistencies with this Instruction, the CA, the SOW, and the
   responsibilities of the CAP to the Air Force.
   1.7.5. Review and coordination on all CAP Corporate MOUs, MOAs, Letter(s) of
   Agreement (LOA), or any other formal agreement with state and local agencies which
   involve use of federally provided resources. (T-2). Although not a party to these agreements,
   CAP-USAF/CC will review these agreements prior to signatories signing and CAP-
   USAF/CC, or higher authority, may disapprove any or all portions of such proposed
   agreements which are inconsistent with federal interests. (T-2).
   1.7.6. Consultation with the Grants Officer if CAP cannot meet the criteria for advance
   payments. (T-1).
   1.7.7. Approval of the disposition of CAP equipment that was procured through federal
   agencies or purchased with federal funds. (T-1).
1.8. Records Management. Records created and received by Air Force entities in support of
CAP must be managed under the Air Force records management program criteria, maintained
IAW the Privacy Act of 1974, and disposed of IAW AFI 33-322, Records Management
Program. (T-2).
AFI10-2701 31 JULY 2014                                                                      13


                                          Chapter 2

                        AIR FORCE USE OF CIVIL AIR PATROL

2.1. Utilization. The Air Force may utilize CAP units and personnel in fulfilling selected non-
combat programs and missions of the Air Force. Missions assigned by the SECAF, or the
designee, to CAP must be identified and referred to as AFAMs in advance of mission execution.
AFAMs may support non-combat programs and organizational functions.
   2.1.1. Objective. The Air Force may employ CAP resources to assist the Air Force, DOD
   and other federal agencies. Under certain circumstances, the SECAF, or the designee, may
   assign CAP assets to provide assistance to state or local agencies and NGOs. Examples
   include: search and rescue, consequence management, homeland security operations, and
   civil support. By using CAP to perform these missions, Air Force units, personnel, and
   resources are made available to perform other Air Force missions. In addition, because of
   the types of aircraft and equipment it employs and the volunteer nature of its members, CAP
   may be able to perform the mission at a lower cost than comparable Air Force units or
   commercial contractors, and thereby may present a more cost effective way for the Air Force
   to accomplish its non-combat missions.
2.2. Air Force Assigned Missions (AFAMs). The Air Force may only use the services of CAP
to perform non-combat missions. Coordination and approval of these missions is accomplished,
on behalf of the SECAF, in accordance with Table 2.1. of this Instruction. The designated
approval authority must first determine if a given mission involves the potential for combat,
combat support, or combat training. (T-1). Prior to assigning any mission to CAP, the approval
authority must be satisfied the mission involves strictly non-combat activities as defined by
paragraph 1.2.5.1. of this Instruction. At no time may CAP resources be placed in situations of
risk analogous to combat operations, or for exposure to hazards deemed immitigable by the
mission approval authority. CAP will not execute AFAMs outside the United States, the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands unless specifically authorized by the
AF/A3/5 on behalf of the SECAF. This limitation is not applicable to AFAMs where CAP will
be operating over international waters provided point of departure and intended landing, to
include alternate and emergency recovery airfields, is within the United States, the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. If the AFAM requires transit over
international waters, the route may not include transiting any foreign territory.
   2.2.1. AFAM Criteria. An AFAM is a CAP activity that is either (1) performed pursuant to
   a request for services from a federal department or agency, (2) performed pursuant to a
   request for services submitted by a State or local government, tribal government, or NGO
   that the USAF has subsequently reviewed and determined to contain a demonstrable federal
   interest, (3) designated by the appropriate USAF approval authority as a category of AFAMs,
   such as certain CAP training missions, or (4) any other activity that the SECAF or authorized
   designee specifically tasks CAP to perform or that CAP obtains approval to perform as an
   AFAM from the SECAF or the designee after submitting a request for AFAM status. If the
   CAP activity is a response to a request for services from a federal department or agency and
   funding is required as determined by CAP-USAF/CC, it will not be considered an AFAM
   until the requesting organization submits sufficient funding and the Administrative Grants
   Officer issues a funding modification to the CA. For requests from a State or local
14                                                                 AFI10-2701 31 JULY 2014


  government, tribal government, or NGO, it will not be considered an AFAM until the
  requesting organization submits sufficient funding, if required, and the AFAM is approved
  by the appropriate SECAF designee. In any case, the AFAM must be conducted for the
  benefit of the requesting department, agency, government, tribal government, or NGO and
  serve an identified federal interest. In addition, the scope and duties or the objective of the
  mission must be developed by the federal department, agency, government, tribal
  government, or NGO and the activity and method of carrying out the duties or objective is
  expressly approved by the SECAF, or the appropriate designee as identified in this
  Instruction, prior to the activity. An AFAM may or may not be funded with federally
  appropriated funds. AFAM status approval will be confirmed either through a valid mission
  number in Web Mission Information Reporting System (WMIRS) or in writing by the
  mission approval authority. (T-1). Whether the Federal Tort Claims Act or Federal
  Employee Compensation Act covers participants in a CAP activity does not create or negate
  AFAM status.
  2.2.2. Existing and New Mission Types. Requests for new missions, to include possible
  AFAM status, not otherwise addressed in this Instruction, will be referred to AF/A3/5 for
  operational missions or SAF/MR for all other missions for approval. Determination for
  forwarding new mission requests rests with the CAP-USAF/CC. The following is a non-
  exhaustive list of the types of non-combat missions the SECAF, or the designee, may assign
  to CAP:
     2.2.2.1. Homeland Security Operations. CAP may be assigned to respond to requests for
     homeland security missions in support of the Air Force, including but not limited to
     missions in support of critical infrastructure protection, border and port security, and
     “presence missions”. Such missions may include the use of airborne reconnaissance
     using visual observation and imagery IAW applicable laws and regulations.
     2.2.2.2. Search and Rescue/Disaster Relief. CAP may be assigned to respond to requests
     for emergency services submitted to the Air Force from other federal agencies, or from
     state or local governmental authorities, or from NGOs. These services include, but are
     not limited to, search and rescue (SAR) and disaster relief (DR). CAP conducts
     air/ground SAR and DR operations in response to man-made events or natural disasters.
     SAR operations are normally requested through the Air Force Rescue Coordination
     Center (AFRCC) (for CONUS), Alaska RCC (for inland Alaska), USCG District 14
     Command Center, and/or JTF-Homeland Defense, Ft. Shafter (for Hawaii), or USCG
     Sector San Juan Command Center (for Puerto Rico) and/or other DOD joint personnel
     recovery centers. CAP members also assist in SAR missions by using cellular phone
     triangulation and radar forensics. When doing so these members are conducting AFAMs.
     DR operations may include reconnaissance of impacted areas, airlift or ground
     transportation of high-priority cargo or personnel, communications relay, and public
     affairs support. SAR/DR mission requests require Air Force approval, and are carried out
     under Air Force authority. DR operations are normally requested by FEMA or a federal
     or state agency. If the request comes from a federal agency or there is a federal interest
     the mission will be an AFAM.
     2.2.2.3. Support to Law Enforcement. CAP may be assigned to respond to requests for
     assistance submitted to the Air Force by civilian law enforcement agencies. All such
     requests will be reviewed for compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including
AFI10-2701 31 JULY 2014                                                                        15


     10 U.S.C. §§ 371-382, the Posse Comitatus Act, DODI 3025.21, and AFI 10-801 by the
     appropriate Air Force authority (under Table 2.1.) in coordination with its legal staff and
     will not be approved unless they comply. Examples of law enforcement support may
     include aerial reconnaissance, transportation of law enforcement personnel, and operation
     of equipment in order to facilitate communications.
        2.2.2.3.1. Drug Interdiction Activities. AFAMs may include limited counter-drug
        missions as authorized by Section 1004 of the Fiscal Year (FY) 1991 National
        Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 101-510), as amended and restated. If no funds are
        appropriated for counter drug missions, AFAMs may be conducted as long as the
        costs are reimbursed by the supported agency.
        2.2.2.3.2. Prohibited Activities. In accordance with the Posse Comitatus Act, CAP
        will not participate in the interdiction of vehicles, vessels, or aircraft or in a search,
        seizure, arrest, apprehension, surveillance, pursuit, or similar activity. These
        restrictions do not prohibit aerial drug/contraband spotting or detection and/or
        monitoring missions approved by the mission approval authority in accordance with
        DOD policies.
     2.2.2.4. Combat Training Support. CAP may be assigned to perform certain services in
     support of combat training, such as aerial target missions, Surrogate Predator operations,
     radar calibration, and communications. CAP will not participate in actual combat
     training. Note: CAP members (including cadets) can participate in mass casualty
     training.
     2.2.2.5. Range and Airspace Surveys. CAP may be assigned to inspect military special
     use ranges and airspace for safety hazards. Missions include, but are not limited to,
     surveys of low level routes, air-to-ground weapons range restricted areas, military
     operating areas, or the Air Force Thunderbird show line surveys. Military personnel such
     as Airspace Managers may fly on these missions with proper approval from the AFAM
     approval authority, see Table 2.1. Missions may also include border and port surveys.
     2.2.2.6. Orientation Flights in CAP Aircraft. CAP may be assigned to conduct powered
     and non-powered orientation flights to be flown by CAP pilots for CAP, Junior Reserve
     Officer Training Corps (JROTC), US Air Force Academy and Reserve Officer Training
     Corps (ROTC) cadets. These flights are consistent with the Air Force missions and
     objectives of Community Outreach and Diversity in Operations. Like all other AFAMs,
     orientation flights must be specifically approved and assigned to CAP in advance by the
     Air Force. Approval of new programs will be made by AF/A3/5 or higher Air Force
     authority after consultation with AETC/ A3. Once a program has been approved by
     appropriate authority, individual missions may be approved by CAP-USAF/CC. These
     CAP orientation flights are distinct from the Air Force orientation flights described in
     paragraph 3.15. of this Instruction.
     2.2.2.7. Light Airlift. CAP may be assigned to transport priority personnel and cargo.
     These missions may be flown under any of the approved mission categories supporting
     operational missions and provide prudent cost effective support. For example, CAP may
     provide support to the Air Force Mid-Air Collision Avoidance (MACA) Program by
     transporting Flight Safety Officers to outlying civil airfields. CAP will not be used to
     support transportation to routine meetings and conferences.
 16                                                                AFI10-2701 31 JULY 2014


      2.2.2.8. Public Affairs Support. Public affairs (PA) support may also be provided by the
      CAP. PA support flights will be approved in accordance with Table 2.1.
      2.2.2.9. Communications.       CAP may be assigned to employ its nationwide
      communications capability for AF or another national agency mission support to include
      HF, HF-Automatic Linking Equipment (HF-ALE), VHF-AM, and VHF-FM (fixed,
      mobile, and repeater) systems.
      2.2.2.10. Training Missions. CAP may perform training missions to prepare its members
      to execute AFAMs. This may include proficiency and upgrade training and upgrades to
      FAA airmen’s ratings. Normally, only training missions that are necessary to prepare
      CAP members to perform specialized or unique Air Force non-combat missions may be
      approved as AFAMs. CAP-USAF/CC is the approval authority for CAP training
      missions when they are performed as AFAMs. Such training missions will not be
      combined with other CAP activities (including corporate activities) without the express
      approval of the CAP-USAF/CC or delegated authority, or higher Air Force authority.
      2.2.2.11. Missions in Support of Air Force Organizational Functions. The CAP-
      USAF/CC, or the designee, may assign tasks to support certain “organizational function”
      missions to CAP as AFAMs. These organizational functions develop and sustain the Air
      Force and include the following activities:
          2.2.2.11.1. Support to accessions and recruiting.
          2.2.2.11.2. Support to training and education.
          2.2.2.11.3. Support to testing and evaluation.
      2.2.2.12. Incident Facility Activities. When conducting AFAMs, CAP may establish
      Incident Facilities as required to support localized control of CAP resources. Incident
      Facilities may use established or temporary locations. Incident Facilities personnel will
      execute support activities for AFAMs such as sortie tracking, logistics, communications,
      finance, and administration. Personnel serving at Incident Facilities actively supporting
      AFAMs may be approved as executing AFAMs.
      2.2.2.13. Other Missions. CAP may perform other AFAMs when properly authorized
      and assigned by the appropriate approval authority as provided in Table 2.1. Examples
      may include, but not limited to: assisting at forward incident centers, filling sandbags,
      and providing logistic support to emergency workers.
2.3. Employment Priority. CAP may perform services for state and local authorities in its
corporate capacity while simultaneously providing assistance to the Air Force. AFAMs take
priority over all other CAP activities.
2.4. Use of CAP by Air Force Commanders. CAP is a cost effective force multiplier. Air
Force commanders are encouraged to request CAP to conduct missions that are within CAP’s
capability to perform. Commanders must ensure funds are available to reimburse CAP for
requested services before the mission is approved.
   2.4.1. Employment Requests. A military Commander who desires CAP support must make
   the request to the appropriate approval authority shown in Table 2.1 using the contacts listed
   in Attachment 3. (T-1). The commander must provide the purpose and scope of CAP
   activity, specify the date and time of mission start and its expected length, and provide the
AFI10-2701 31 JULY 2014                                                                       17


   point of contact for CAP mission coordinator. (T-1). Refer to paragraph 2.7. for payment of
   CAP services.
   2.4.2. Command and Control. While performing AFAMs, the Air Force, through the
   mission approval authority or the requesting Air Force organization, will maintain
   operational direction using the CAP chain of command. (T-1).
   2.4.3. Accident/Incident Reporting. When required, the CAP-USAF/CC will submit an
   AETC Commander’s Critical Information Report (CCIR) IAW paragraph 2.9. of this
   Instruction. (T-2).
2.5. AFAM Coordination and Approval. Table 2.1. of this Instruction sets forth the
coordination process and approval authorities for AFAMs.
   2.5.1. Risk Analysis. Mission approval authorities will consider the risks associated with
   assigning a specific mission to a civilian volunteer organization. (T-1). Risk Management
   techniques should be utilized to determine and minimize this risk as needed.
   2.5.2. Civil Support Approval Process. Mission approval authorities must be aware that
   DOD policies governing the coordination and approval of requests for support to civil
   authorities typically do not apply to CAP missions. (T-1). In general, mission approval
   authorities ensure CAP missions supporting state or local agencies or NGOs as AFAMs
   demonstrate a “federal interest” in the activity. For example, a state agency may sponsor an
   exercise that requests CAP for reconnaissance support of a key power generating facility, a
   critical piece of infrastructure, would clearly be of “federal interest” and eligible for AFAM
   status. Conversely, State requests for routine support such as agriculture or wildlife surveys
   would usually not rise to the level of “federal interest,” and may be flown as corporate
   missions. The SECAF, or the designee, may respond directly to civil-support requests,
   including those involving counter-drug activities, using the services of CAP, subject to the
   following restrictions:
      2.5.2.1. The applicable NAF Commander will inform the responsible Combatant
      Commander about the number and type of CAP missions approved in their area of
      responsibility.
      2.5.2.2. The Air Force will refer all requests for CAP support to the Joint Director of
      Military Support (JDOMS) when such requests either appear to be more appropriate for
      other DOD components or require the use of additional Air Force resources beyond CAP
      resources.
      2.5.2.3. The AF/A3/5 may enter into MOA/Us with other agencies in order to facilitate
      anticipated long-term or continuing civil support requests. When other federal agencies
      do not wish to enter into MOA/Us, requests for CAP support (as the AFAUX), and
      assignment of AFAMs may still be processed according to paragraph 2.5.2.
   2.5.3. Media Support Missions and Media Releases. CAP may provide public affairs/media
   support under all AFAM categories.
      2.5.3.1. Media Support. Occurs when external media participates on missions with the
      purpose of generating a news story. For flying missions, this is often referred to as a
      media flight or "ride along" mission.
18                                                                 AFI10-2701 31 JULY 2014


         2.5.3.1.1. Media Release Authority. The AFAM approval authority, as identified in
         Table 2.1., is also the media release authority unless mission related guidance (i.e.
         OPLAN, MOA, MOU, etc.) appoints the requesting agency’s PA as the media release
         authority. Media release authority may be delegated.
         2.5.3.1.2. Requests for Media Support. All requests for media support will include
         the name of the passenger and media organization, the purpose of the request, and the
         desired mission date/time. Media outlets requesting support must be validated
         through verification of media credentials.
         2.5.3.1.3. Verification of Media Credentials. The NAF PA representative normally
         verifies media credentials. When requested, the NOC, with the support of a local
         CAP PA representative, may assist with media credential verification. Upon
         verification of media credentials, the NAF PA representative will forward the request
         to the AFAM approval authority (see Table 2.1.).
     2.5.3.2. CAP Media Release. A CAP-generated news story may be released to media
     outlets with the express purpose of being disseminated to the public. Social media,
     personal blogs and like websites are not considered media outlets as necessary credentials
     cannot be verified. Validated media releases may be posted to these websites.
         2.5.3.2.1. High Profile Missions. Missions with potential to generate high media
         interest at the national, regional or local level are considered high profile. Missions
         deemed to be high profile will be annotated in CAP’s mission tracking program
         WMIRS.
         2.5.3.2.2. CAP Generated AFAM Media Releases. CAP generated AF media release
         requests related to AFAMs will be directed to the appropriate mission approval
         authority's (see Table 2.1.) PA representative for approval. (T-1). CAP will verify
         customer release and releases from individuals cited in any article/photo are
         completed prior to dissemination (not required for CAP members).
  2.5.4. Non-CAP Passenger Approval. Non-CAP passengers or crew are authorized when
  essential to the mission and will be approved by the mission approval authority prior to
  flying on AFAMs. (T-1). The risk of assuming federal liability will be weighed against the
  benefits gained in making a determination to approve the request. Names of non-CAP
  passengers requesting to fly on operational missions should be submitted not later than 48
  hours prior to take off and at least five (5) days prior to takeoff for training missions. This
  allows for a reasonable time frame to obtain approval from the approval authority.
  Exceptions will be allowed for critical missions, life threatening or other compelling
  priorities. (T-1). The passenger approval is still considered valid if passenger name changes
  as long as the requesting agency (DOD, FEMA, USFS, etc.), number of individuals, and
  mission purpose remain the same as the original request. Passenger requests from DVs (O-6
  equivalent or above) should be sent to the mission approval authority detailing the purpose of
  the passenger request and any required special handling.
  2.5.5. Distinguished Member Observation/Indoctrination Missions. Distinguished members
  may request to fly on CAP aircraft for the purpose of observing operations over an area for
  which they have purview or familiarizing themselves with CAP capabilities. In this context,
  distinguished members refer to senior ranking DOD members, department heads, members
AFI10-2701 31 JULY 2014                                                                     19


   of Congress, or equivalent key leaders within the requesting agency. These missions are
   generated specifically for the distinguished member and should not be confused with “ride
   along” status of an existing AFAM (see paragraph 2.5.4.) or transportation requests.
   Requests for observation/indoctrination missions will be made to the applicable NAF
   Commander for review and approval. Do not commit to AFAM flights involving Members
   of Congress or Congressional staffers until SAF/LLM provides notification flight is
   approved.
2.6. Economy Act. Typically, any federal agency requesting assistance from the Air Force
must certify its request comports with the Economy Act, 31 U.S.C. § 1535. The appropriate Air
Force mission approval authority will ensure compliance with (or exception to) the Economy Act
procedures set forth in AFI 65-601V1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, prior to approving an
AFAM by CAP in support of a federal agency. (T-1).
2.7. Payment for CAP Services. Mission support shall ordinarily be done on a cost-
reimbursable basis funded by the supported agency. DOD organizations providing funding shall
send a Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR), DD Form 448, to CAP-USAF/FM
(see Attachment 3) for an amount equal to reimbursement for the approved mission for
obligation/modification under the Cooperative Agreement prior to the time of mission execution.
Other federal agencies shall send the appropriate funding authorization to CAP-USAF/FM prior
to mission execution indicating the agency has set aside an amount equal to the reimbursement.
CAP-USAF/FM will return unexecuted funds to the requesting organization. (T-2).
2.8. Restrictions on CAP Corporate Activities. Notwithstanding any DOD or Air Force
regulation, policy or agreement, the following specific restrictions apply to CAP’s corporate
activities:
   2.8.1. Air Force Markings. CAP Corporation may not use aircraft and resources that are
   marked with “USAF,” “USAF Auxiliary,” “U.S. Air Force,” or similar identifiers to engage
   in the law enforcement activities listed in paragraph 2.2.2.3. of this Instruction and its
   subparagraphs, without prior approval by AF/A3/5.
   2.8.2. Intelligence Activities. CAP is not an intelligence organization, has no assigned
   intelligence mission, and will not engage in intelligence activities. Because CAP is not an
   intelligence organization, CAP is not required to obtain a Proper Use Memorandum (PUM)
   to take domestic imagery on corporate missions.
2.9. Accident/Incident Reporting. When informed of a mishap or incident, the CAP-
USAF/CC will submit an AETC Commander’s Critical Information Report, IAW AFI 10-206,
Operational Reporting, normally through Maxwell AFB command post channels, for the
following, regardless of CAP mission status (T-2):
   2.9.1. Any fatality related to the performance of a CAP mission. This includes both AFAMs
   and Corporate missions as well as travel to/from these missions.
   2.9.2. Any CAP-owned aircraft that is destroyed or significantly damaged.
   2.9.3. Any CAP member’s privately owned aircraft that is destroyed or significantly
   damaged while performing an AFAM.
   2.9.4. Any significant property damage on the ground.
 20                                                                             AFI10-2701 31 JULY 2014


    2.9.5. Criminal activity or misconduct by a CAP member that occurred while at a CAP event
    that may have an operational impact or reflect negatively on the Air Force.
    2.9.6. Any accident that may have large scale media interest.
    2.9.7. Any other incident the CAP-USAF/CC determines should be reported.

NOTES:
1. Chaplain Assistance to USAF. CAP may provide chaplain support to Air Force active duty, Reserve or
Guard (in Title 10 Status) units as set forth in AFI 52-101 and the Memorandum of Agreement between the
Air Force Chaplain Corps and the CAP Chaplain Program. Requests for CAP support as an AFAM will be
submitted to the CAP-USAF/CC or MAJCOM/Numbered AF/CC, as appropriate, through the CAP National
Operations Center (NOC) (see Attachment 3 for contact information). (T-2). For AFAM requests in support
of single isolated, limited-scope events, such as a temporary augmentation of an AF wing chaplain staff, the
CAP-USAF/CC, or designee, is the approval authority. For all other instances, the appropriate NAF is the
approval authority. The requesting AF Wing Chaplain will validate the request by informing the approval
authority of the need for CAP chaplain assistance. (T-2).
2. Chaplain Assistance to DOD and other Agencies and Entities. CAP chaplains serving exclusively
under the authority of CAP in its corporate capacity may provide chaplain support to state, tribal, territorial
and local authorities, and NGOs. However when acting pursuant to an AFAM (e.g. providing services to
DOD and other federal agencies), a CAP Chaplain's duties are limited to those authorized by AF/HC for Air
Force Chaplains. Examples of such assistance may include base chaplain services, as well as chaplain/support
services approved in response to operational missions, such as disaster relief activities.
3. Delegation Authority. The PACAF, 11 AF, and 1 AF commanders are the only MAJCOM/Numbered AF
commanders delegated the authority to approve Air Force assigned CAP Missions. The MAJCOM/Numbered
AF Commander will follow the notification procedures set forth in paragraph 2.5.2.
4. Federal Agencies. In accordance with 10 U.S.C. § 9442 (a), CAP may only support federal agencies in its
status as the AFAUX.
5. Traumatic Stress Response (TSR). Prior to requesting CAP personnel to provide TSR services in
support of an AFAM other than routine support of CAP personnel (examples: Support to an Air Base Wing
after an aircraft accident or support to other federal agencies after a disaster), the 1AF/11AF/PACAF C-NAF
Commander, with the recommendation of the C-NAF Surgeon General, must approve CAP participation in
such activities IAW AFI 44-153 or AFI 52-104.
AFI10-2701 31 JULY 2014                                                                                              21


6. Public Affairs Support. CAP may provide PA support flights under all mission categories. The mission
approval authority may approve support upon receiving a request from the media agency. The request will be
coordinated with the approval authority’s PA staff as per paragraph 2.5.3.
7. Non-CAP Passengers. Non-CAP passengers or crew are authorized when essential to the mission and will
be approved by the mission approval authority as per paragraph 2.5.4. (T-1).
8. 1AF Delegation. 1AF/CC has delegated approval authority to AFRCC for SAR missions and the 601
AOC Commander for all other missions.
9. AFRCC/RCC/JPRC (Rescue Coordination Center). Centers will provide mission approvals to the CAP
NOC via CAP’s Web Mission Information Reporting System (WMIRS). CAP will provide mission reporting
to AFRCC/RCC via WMIRS. AFRCC or RCC may give direct liaison authority of the CAP to the USCG for
SAR support. (T-1).
10. CAP-USAF Approved Missions. These may include AFAMs executed pursuant to specific Air Force
directives or taskings that do not fit into specifically authorized mission categories (examples: ferry flights to
deliver aircraft to maintenance facilities in order to accomplish Air Force required maintenance or delivery of
aircraft or vehicles to specific locations for Air Force mandated inspections, or operational check flights
following maintenance). CAP-USAF/CC may approve missions to move aircraft in the case of impending
severe weather so long as the mission will comply with paragraph 2.2. Refer to notes 1 and 2 for approval of
chaplain supported AFAMs.
11. Memoranda of Agreement/Understanding (MOA/U). Under normal circumstances, federal non-DOD
operational missions will be flown under the terms of an MOA/U signed by AF/A3/5. In the event a valid
mission must be flown and there is no MOA/U and time precludes developing one, the respective
MAJCOM/NAF/CC will obtain AF/A3/5 approval; direct communication by telephonic or electronic means is
permitted.
12. Missions. An Air Component Commander may be tasked to execute a Defense Support of Civil
Authority mission or other DoD mission by a Combatant Commander. Further, pursuant to the Economy Act,
an Air Force unit may provide support to a non-DoD Federal Operational Mission to include the provision of
Civil Support. In all such cases, within the United States, the support/mission needed from the Air Force may
be assigned to the CAP, as an Air Force auxiliary unit, by the PACAF, 11 AF, or 1 AF commander.

                                          Chapter 3

                  AIR FORCE SUPPORT TO THE CIVIL AIR PATROL

3.1. Support. The Air Force may provide personnel, logistical, and financial support assistance
to CAP, including Installation-level support, in accordance with 10 U.S.C. §§ 9443-9444. CAP-
USAF coordinates with CAP to budget, purchase, distribute, and maintain certain assets
necessary to accomplish the CAP mission. These assets specifically include aircraft, vehicles,
computers, communications equipment, associated parts, and cadet uniforms. This section
describes the support the Air Force may provide to CAP.
   3.1.1. CAP-USAF Responsibilities. In response to the apportionment of federal funds,
   equipment, and missions to CAP, the Air Force must exercise responsibility for support,
   liaison, and oversight of the program. To execute this duty, CAP-USAF may utilize all
   personnel (active component, reserve component, DAF civilians, and contractors).
       3.1.1.1. Compliance Inspections. CAP-USAF, in coordination with CAP/IG, will
       conduct, as a minimum, compliance inspections on CAP wing headquarters on a
       recurring basis to ensure programmatic compliance, safety, accountability of resources,
       standardization and the sharing of benchmarked practices. (T-1). If necessary, CAP/IG
       may conduct compliance inspections on CAP units. CAP region headquarters may also
       receive compliance inspections by CAP-USAF, CAP/IG, or both.
   3.1.2. Staff Assistance Visits (SAVs). CAP-USAF, in coordination with CAP/IG, may
   conduct SAVs on CAP region and wing headquarters on a recurring basis to establish a
   baseline and identify weaknesses and strengths in advance of a compliance inspection.
   3.1.3. Logistics Audits. To verify accountability of appropriated resources at intervals more
   frequent than the compliance inspection, CAP-USAF will administer logistics audits of the
   CAP wing and region headquarters. (T-2).
   3.1.4. Training and Certification. CAP-USAF, on a recurring basis, will train, evaluate and
   certify CAP wings to perform disaster response, search and rescue, and all other non-combat
   missions as assigned by the Air Force. (T-1).
   3.1.5. Other Liaison Activities. In addition to the oversight activities listed above, CAP-
   USAF will provide ongoing support to CAP regions, wings, units, and activities. This
   support is described in the following paragraphs.
3.2. Liaison Officers. The Air Force may provide personnel support to CAP in the form of
liaison personnel. Air Force liaison to CAP consists of active duty, reserve component, and/or
civilian employees. The Air Force may establish liaison offices and detail or assign Air Force
personnel at CAP national, regional, state, and territorial headquarters. The Air Force retains
authority to determine CAP liaison organization, structure, and duties of its members. Liaison
personnel will provide advice and assistance to CAP, liaison between CAP, the Air Force, and
other government agencies, as well as oversight of CAP in fulfilling AFAMs. All CAP-USAF
assigned liaison personnel are under the supervision of CAP-USAF. Refer to paragraph 3.2.3 for
AF installation liaison officer requirements.
AFI10-2701 31 JULY 2014                                                                      23


  3.2.1. Air Force Liaison Structure. The Air Force provides guidance to CAP through AETC,
  AU, the Jeanne M. Holm Center for Officer Accessions and Citizen Development, and CAP-
  USAF.
     3.2.1.1. Liaison to CAP National Headquarters. Headquarters CAP-USAF is the liaison
     activity to the CAP National Headquarters. Liaison at this level principally consists of
     advice, assistance, and Air Force oversight of the programs and policies of CAP; the
     acquisition of new aircraft, vehicles, and equipment; and reimbursement to CAP for costs
     associated with conducting missions.
     3.2.1.2. Liaison to CAP Regions. CAP-USAF operates a region liaison activity to
     support each CAP region. CAP-USAF liaison region personnel provide advice,
     assistance, and Air Force oversight to the CAP region commander and staff by advising,
     assisting and motivating CAP personnel in the CAP mission at the discretion of the
     liaison region commander and as directed by the CAP-USAF Commander.
     3.2.1.3. Liaison to CAP Wings. CAP-USAF liaison region personnel, to include
     assigned or attached Reserve component members, provide advice, assistance, and Air
     Force oversight to the CAP wing commander, staff and subordinate units within the
     wing.
     3.2.1.4. Liaison to 1st Air Force. CAP-USAF will maintain a liaison officer at 1st Air
     Force Headquarters. (T-2). The CAP-USAF liaison officer will serve as a CAP subject
     matter expert and advise the 1AF/CC and staff on CAP capabilities and limitations.
     During periods of high CAP usage (e.g. hurricanes, large scale exercises) additional
     liaison personnel may be required.
  3.2.2. Reserve Assistance to the CAP. CAP-USAF employs reservists as an extension of the
  liaison structure to support the AF and CAP. CAP-USAF will employ reservists to advise,
  assist, train, evaluate, and motivate CAP personnel with respect to CAP’s mission as an
  auxiliary of the Air Force. (T-2). Although many duties may be performed for retirement
  points credit only, the program requires Military Personnel Allocation (MPA) days to
  execute the duties of CAP-USAF’s active component mission. All activities of such
  reservists are under the functional supervision of CAP-USAF.
     3.2.2.1. Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) Responsibilities. Air Reserve Personnel
     Center will provide administrative personnel support for all Air Force Reserve members
     assigned or attached to CAP-USAF. AFRC’s Readiness Management Group (RMG) is
     responsible for ensuring all reservists are ready for duty and can be placed on orders in a
     timely manner. AFRC provides Reserve Personnel Allocation man-days as appropriate
     to ensure reservists are trained to perform the CAP-USAF mission. These days will be
     allocated in coordination with the RMG.
     3.2.2.2. CAP-USAF Responsibilities. CAP-USAF will administer and manage the
     Category B and E, Civil Air Patrol Reserve Assistance Program (CAPRAP). (T-2). The
     AU Director for Reserve Forces is the advisor to the CAP-USAF/CC for developing and
     implementing policy guidance and for managing CAPRAP personnel. CAP-USAF
     publishes additional instructions governing the CAPRAP. CAP-USAF will work with
     Holm Center and AU/MPA Functional Area Manager (FAM) to program necessary MPA
     man-days to complete mission duties. (T-2).
 24                                                                  AFI10-2701 31 JULY 2014


       3.2.2.3. Category B, Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) Reservists. IMAs
       augment the CAP-USAF liaison region. The AU Director for Reserve Forces and the
       Holm Center IMAs both advise the CAP-USAF/CC in development and implementation
       of guidance and the management of CAPRAP personnel. IMAs will brief the military
       Installation Commanders annually on CAP capabilities in support of the Air Force and
       civil authorities and will perform other duties required by the CAP-USAF/CC or liaison
       officers. (T-3).
       3.2.2.4. Category E, Participating Individual Ready Reservists (PIRRs). PIRRs assist the
       CAP-USAF liaison offices in training, evaluating, advising, assisting, and motivating
       CAP personnel in the CAP mission. Reservists may assist in, but are not limited to,
       conducting compliance inspections, operations evaluations, ground training events,
       logistics audits, staff assistance visits, mission and exercise support, Career Exploration
       Courses, cadet encampments and events, unit visits, and performing administrative duties
       necessary for the health of CAPRAP and other duties as directed by the CAP-USAF/CC.
3.2.3. Liaison at Air Force Installations. Support from Air Force installations is important for
CAP to carry out its missions. Liaison activities at this level typically involve coordinating the
use of facilities and services of the installation. Installation commanders will appoint a field
grade officer to assist the CAP-USAF Liaison Region personnel and to act as a liaison with CAP
units conducting activities on the installation. (T-3). Installation commanders will provide the
designee’s name, rank, office symbol and telephone number to CAP-USAF Liaison Region
Commander and will update this information annually or when installation liaison turnover
occurs. (T-3). When providing short-term support to CAP units, installation commanders may
also designate a project officer to work with the CAP unit. Installation commanders will contact
CAP-USAF liaison personnel directly to coordinate matters relating to CAP (T-3).
3.3. CAP National Headquarters. The Air Force may provide funds for the CAP National
Headquarters, including funds for the payment of staff compensation and benefits, administrative
expenses, travel, per diem and allowances, rent, utilities, and other operational expenses of the
National Headquarters. The Air Force provides space for the CAP National Headquarters at
Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. Telecommuting is authorized to conduct National
Headquarters operations away from Maxwell AFB, AL and may only be approved by the CAP
Chief Operating Officer (COO).
   3.3.1. CAP Wing Administrators and CAP Wing Financial Analysts. The Air Force may
   provide funds for compensation, benefits, travel, per diem, and allowances for a CAP Wing
   Administrator at each CAP Wing and CAP Wing Financial Analysts on a regional basis.
   These employees provide administrative and program support to CAP in order to facilitate
   compliance with CAP’s obligations under the CA and SOW. Both the CAP Wing
   Administrator and CAP Wing Financial Analyst positions are necessary to fulfill Air Force
   requirements. CAP Wing administrators and CAP Wing Financial Analysts are considered
   CAP National Headquarters employees.
   3.3.2. CAP National Operations Center (NOC). The NOC is the primary focal point for all
   outside agencies requesting CAP mission support.            The NOC coordinates all
   mission/resource requests with the CAP wings/regions performing the mission and obtains
   mission approval from the AFAM approval authority as indicated by Table 2.1. The NOC is
AFI10-2701 31 JULY 2014                                                                      25


   also responsible for ensuring mission data and results are reported to the MAJCOM/NAF/CC
   in a timely manner.
   3.3.3. National Technology Center. The National Technology Center (NTC) provides
   equipment support and repair for CAP communications infrastructure. The NTC resides at
   Maxwell AFB, AL.
   3.3.4. National Emergency Services Academy Center for Operations Excellence. The
   National Emergency Services Academy (NESA) Center for Operations Excellence (COE)
   provides operations and emergency services training support to CAP members throughout
   the country. The NESA-COE hosts training at its Camp Atterbury Joint Maneuver Training
   Center (CAJMTC) site, and assists wings and regions in developing similar programs. CAP-
   USAF assists CAP in coordinating and facilitating AFAM training events and support
   amongst other DOD events hosted at CAJMTC. CAP-USAF Reservists are normally
   assigned for larger schools to assist with critical needs. NESA-COE personnel are
   considered CAP National Headquarters volunteers.
3.4. Logistical Support. The Air Force may provide certain types of logistic support to CAP to
fulfill its missions as an auxiliary of the Air Force. CAP, as a non-profit organization, must
comply with the provisions of the DoDGARs in order to receive Air Force appropriated fund
support. CAP-USAF/LG is responsible for logistic support to CAP. (T-2).
   3.4.1. Equipment. The Air Force may give, lend, or sell to CAP major items of equipment
   (including aircraft, motor vehicles, computers, and communications equipment) which are
   excess to the military departments, and the necessary related supplies and training aids that
   are also excess.
   3.4.2. Materiel Disposition Services. CAP may screen certain excess personal property
   materiel from the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Disposition Services IAW DOD
   4160.21-M, Defense Materiel Disposition Manual, Aug 1997. The types and amounts of
   items screened by CAP is determined and controlled by CAP-USAF/CC.
   3.4.3. Government Furnished Equipment (GFE). The Air Force may provide CAP with
   unique GFE when required for AFAMs or when it is impractical for CAP to acquire
   equipment, e.g., secure or specialized communications equipment, full motion video assets,
   etc.
3.5. Financial Support. The Air Force provides CAP with funds for costs deemed allowable
under relevant law, regulations, or any Air Force agreement with CAP. Funds will be provided
IAW DoDGARs and AFI 65-601V1, Section 7E. AFAMs may be funded (reimbursable) or non-
funded (not reimbursable). Funded missions will be identified and accounted for using
appropriate methods IAW DoDGARs unless otherwise directed by Air Force authority.
   3.5.1. Programming and Budgeting. The Air Force plans for appropriated fund support to
   CAP within the existing planning, programming, budgeting and execution system through
   the AETC Program Objective Memorandum (POM), Air Combat Command Core Function
   Lead Integrator priority lists, and the HQ Air Force Program Element Monitor (PEM). In
   order to allow the Air Force to program and budget for CAP’s Air Force funded programs,
   CAP provides to CAP-USAF/CC substantive information to allow the CAP-USAF/CC to
   submit a POM request, a Financial Plan, and a Budget Execution Report annually to
   AU/A8/FM. Budget information must be submitted IAW timeframes, guidelines, and
 26                                                                  AFI10-2701 31 JULY 2014


   formats established by CAP-USAF/FM, AU/A8/FM, ACC/A8, and AETC/A8/FM to enable
   CAP to comply with Air Force requirements.
   3.5.2. Forms of Financial Support to CAP for the Performance of AFAMs. Unless otherwise
   specified in this Instruction, CAP-USAF/CC may approve funding for the following types of
   expenses when such expenses are incurred in support of properly approved AFAMs:
       3.5.2.1. Travel Expenses. Travel expenses and allowances to members of CAP while the
       members are carrying out programs, training and missions specifically assigned by the
       Air Force. Reimbursement for travel expenses will not exceed the limits set in the Joint
       Travel Regulations (JTRs).
       3.5.2.2. Supplies. The acquisition of supplies, including fuel, lubricants, and other items
       required for vehicle and aircraft operations.
       3.5.2.3. Servicing, Improving, and Maintaining Equipment. Expenses of placing into
       serviceable condition, improving, and maintaining equipment (including aircraft, motor
       vehicles, computers, and communications equipment) owned or leased by CAP or
       provided as GFE. The Air Force maintains approval authority for all modifications to
       CAP aircraft acquired with federal funds.
       3.5.2.4. Aircraft Purchases. The Air Force has approval authority for all CAP aircraft
       leased or purchased with appropriated funds provided to CAP.
       3.5.2.5. Vehicle Purchases. The Air Force has approval authority for all CAP vehicles
       leased or purchased with appropriated funds.
       3.5.2.6. Equipment Purchases and Leases. The Air Force provides funds for and has
       approval authority for all CAP equipment acquired or leased with federal funds.
       3.5.2.7. National Headquarters. See paragraph 3.3., above.
       3.5.2.8. Wing Administrators. See paragraph 3.3.1., above.
       3.5.2.9. Short-Term Lease of Equipment. The Air Force may fund CAP for the short-
       term lease of required equipment to fulfill the immediate requirements of an AFAM.
       CAP-USAF/CC or designee, in coordination with appropriate legal and comptroller
       offices, is the approval authority for lease agreements and may require that the lease
       include specific terms and conditions, such as damage insurance. For example, CAP may
       be funded for the cost of leasing a replacement aircraft to support a time-critical mission.
       CAP may also be reimbursed for the cost of leasing a twin-engine aircraft for an over-
       water mission.
       3.5.2.10. Other Funds. SECAF, or the designee (not lower than AETC/CC), must
       approve any other Air Force funding for expenses incurred by CAP during the
       performance of AFAMs.
3.6. Use of Member Owned or Furnished Aircraft. CAP Corporate aircraft will be the
resource of choice for AFAMs. However, member-owned or furnished aircraft may be utilized
with the consent of the owner when specific mission requirements preclude using CAP assets,
when CAP assets are unavailable, or when it is fiscally responsible and otherwise legally
permissible to do so. Procedures for requesting use and approval of member-owned or furnished
aircraft will be prescribed in CAP-USAF Instructions and/or CAP Regulations. (T-2). Under
AFI10-2701 31 JULY 2014                                                                     27


emergency or imminently serious conditions, and only if required to accomplish the mission, use
of member-owned or furnished aircraft with a current Hold Harmless Agreement (HHA) may be
approved by the CAP-USAF Liaison Region Commander or higher headquarters as long as the
owner provides a statement in writing that the aircraft meets 14 C.F.R. Part 23 airworthiness
standards.
3.7. Support for Other CAP Activities.
   3.7.1. Cadet Program.
       3.7.1.1. Cadet Uniforms. Per 10 U.S.C. § 9444(b)(11), the AF may provide funds to
       CAP for the purchase of articles of the AF-style uniform and related insignia. The Air
       Force may also furnish articles of the AF-style uniform to CAP cadets without cost.
       Providing funds to purchase CAP cadet uniforms is consistent with AFAMs and
       objectives. IAW the SECAF’s delegation of authority to CAP-USAF in AFPD 10-27
       paragraph 4.5, CAP-USAF/CC has authority to approve expenditures of funds to
       purchase cadet uniforms.
       3.7.1.2. Other Support. Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 9444(b)(11)(B), the Air Force may
       furnish any other support to the CAP cadet program the SECAF determines is consistent
       with Air Force missions and objectives. IAW the SECAF’s delegation of authority to
       CAP-USAF in AFPD 10-27 paragraph 4.5, CAP-USAF/CC has authority to determine
       whether support to the cadet program, not in excess of a total of $150,000 per line item
       per fiscal year, is consistent with Air Force missions and objectives. For amounts
       exceeding $150,000, AETC/ED will determine whether such support is consistent with
       Air Force missions and objectives.
   3.7.2. Aerospace Education Program. The Air Force may provide funds to CAP for
   educational materials concerning aerospace education and Science, Technology,
   Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) subjects for distribution to teachers and students in
   K-12 classrooms and other youth development organizations. The Air Force may also
   provide funds to CAP to conduct K-12 teacher conferences and workshops in the fields of
   aerospace education and STEM subjects. IAW the SECAF’s delegation of authority to
   AETC in AFPD 10-27 paragraph 4.3, AETC/ED has approval authority to determine whether
   such expenditures further the fulfillment of the Air Force missions and objectives, is
   consistent with DODD 5410.18, Public Affairs Community Relations Policy, and the AETC
   Community Outreach and Diversity in Operations program, in accordance with 10 U.S.C. §
   9444(b)(12). This approval authority may be further delegated.
   3.7.3. Chaplain and TSR Programs. The Air Force may provide funds to support the CAP
   Chaplain and TSR programs. CAP-USAF/CC will review and approve all requests for such
   funds. (T-2).
   3.7.4. Recruiting Events. The Air Force may provide public awareness funds to support
   CAP’s efforts to recruit members to perform its three Congressionally chartered missions.
   CAP-USAF/CC will review and approve all requests for such funds. (T-3).
   3.7.5. Claims for Advance or Reimbursement. CAP submits all claims for advance or
   reimbursement electronically through the Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF).
 28                                                                AFI10-2701 31 JULY 2014


3.8. Third Party Liability. The acts or omissions of CAP members that give rise to third party
liability are addressed in one of two ways:
   3.8.1. Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. §§ 1346(b), 2671-80. CAP shall be
   deemed an instrumentality of the Air Force with respect to any act or omission of CAP
   members while carrying out AFAMs. Such coverage includes any CAP personnel acting in
   the scope of employment in support of an AFAM, to include planning, scheduling, operating,
   and aircraft maintenance specifically required for the AFAM. Where there is an issue
   regarding mission status, CAP-USAF/CC or higher authority will make the determination
   after consultation with AF Legal Operations Agency (AFLOA)/JACC. (T-1). AFLOA/JACC
   is the Air Force office with primary responsibility for adjudicating administrative claims
   under the FTCA arising out of CAP’s performance of AFAMs and assists the Department of
   Justice (DOJ) with litigation arising out of the same.
   3.8.2. Payment of Commercial Liability Insurance Premiums. All official CAP activities not
   qualifying as AFAMs must be covered by commercial liability insurance. The Air Force
   may provide appropriated funds for the payment of liability insurance premiums to
   underwrite CAP missions and activities carried out as a federally chartered non-profit
   corporation.
3.9. Workers’ Compensation Protection. When performing AFAMs, CAP members (aged 18
and older) are covered by the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act (FECA) for injuries or
death during the performance of duty. “Performance of duty” means only active service, or
travel to and from service, rendered in performance or support of operational missions under
direction of the Air Force and under written authorization by competent authority covering a
specific assignment and prescribing a time limit for the assignment (5 U.S.C. § 8141(b)(4)). The
Department of Labor (DOL) administers this act. There is no federal loss protection provided for
any other CAP missions.
3.10. Legislative Liaison Support. The Air Force Legislative Liaison Office (SAF/LL), as the
primary Air Force agency dealing with Congress, interfaces with Congress on behalf of the Air
Force. All CAP AFAMs involving members of Congress or their staff members will be
coordinated with SAF/LL. SAF/LL routes CAP-related Congressional Inquiries to SAF/MRR,
AF/A3O-AM and, as appropriate, the CAP-USAF/CC.
3.11. Installation Support. To carry out AFAMs, it is important CAP personnel have access to
adequate facilities and services. At their discretion and expense, Air Force installation
commanders may permit CAP to use installation services and facilities. Long-term support may
include designated CAP use of facilities and services. Short-term support may include
temporary lodging, messing, and ground transportation for CAP activities. Installation
commanders will coordinate with CAP-USAF/CC or designee before entering into any host
installation support agreements with CAP units or activities. (T-2).
   3.11.1. Long-term support. Air Force installation commanders are encouraged to provide
   long-term support to CAP as the host organization for CAP units. CAP units typically do not
   have the operating funds to purchase or rent facilities and must negotiate for meeting and
   office space wherever possible. CAP units do not require the same support as typical Air
   Force units. When practicable, installation commanders may make suitable facilities
   available for long-term use by CAP. CAP units will not be expected to reimburse
AFI10-2701 31 JULY 2014                                                                           29


   installations for long-term use facilities. Note: Installation commanders may authorize long-
   term use of Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) facilities.
   3.11.2. Short-term Support. Air Force installations are encouraged to provide short-term
   support for temporary CAP activities. CAP activities in this category include cadet
   encampments, senior member training activities, flight clinics, and other flying related
   activities. These types of activities typically involve the use of various MWR base facilities
   including lodging, messing, or Non-Appropriated Fund activities such as clubs, exchanges
   and theaters, and services including transportation. CAP may use installation facilities and
   services that operate on a fee for service basis, such as messing and base lodging, at CAP
   member expense, when engaged in installation-sponsored CAP activities.
   3.11.3. Support Considerations. CAP units will be given priority for space on Air Force
   installations immediately following Air Force, DOD, and federal agencies, and ahead of
   youth groups such as scouting, or MWR activities such as hobby clubs or groups. (T-2).
   Installations can arrange with CAP units to provide minor maintenance and housekeeping of
   the facility to defray associated costs of host-tenant support. If practicable, CAP units should
   be provided facilities with adequate administration, storage, and training space. Installation
   commanders with limited space may consider providing CAP units administrative space near
   common use facilities such as community centers, lecture halls, and other suitable training
   facilities. Installations with flight facilities should consider the need for ramp space for CAP
   aircraft or other flying related support or operating requirements.
   3.11.4. Ground Transportation and Equipment. Air Force installation commanders may
   provide government transportation and equipment to CAP units on a temporary basis. When
   providing transportation or equipment to CAP units, the Installation commander must also
   provide a sufficient number of qualified personnel to operate the vehicles or equipment. If
   requested by CAP, the Air Force may provide licensed/qualified drivers/operators for ground
   transportation for use by CAP. CAP members are not authorized to drive government
   vehicles when acting in a CAP capacity.
3.12. Use of Other Government Facilities. Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 9444(c), CAP-USAF/CC
may arrange for CAP to use the facilities or services of other federal government agencies when
use of such facilities or services is considered necessary for CAP to carry out its AFAMs. CAP-
USAF/CC is responsible for arranging for the use of the facilities or services with other federal
government agencies, when appropriate.
3.13. Additional CAP Cadet Program Support. Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 9444(b)(11), the Air
Force may provide certain support to the CAP Cadet Program. Any support to the CAP Cadet
Program must be approved in accordance with paragraph 3.7.1. of this Instruction.
   3.13.1. Training. Air Force installations and units are authorized to provide support to CAP
   cadet training activities and are encouraged to provide such support whenever possible.
   Support may include providing personnel as instructors for leadership training, providing
   tours of installations and units, briefings on installation and unit mission and capabilities, and
   instruction in Air Force roles and missions.
   3.13.2. Cadet Encampments. CAP cadet encampments can be the most significant,
   worthwhile training experience in a CAP cadet’s career. Cadet encampments try to
   incorporate visits to the activities of the host installation, such as security forces, base fire
30                                                                  AFI10-2701 31 JULY 2014


  station, or other unique units or facilities, as part of the training curriculum. Exposure to the
  AF during cadet encampments can greatly influence CAP cadets to later pursue careers in the
  Air Force. However, CAP is not an official recruiting tool for the Air Force.
  3.13.3. Overseas Cadet Program. The purpose of the overseas cadet program is to
  accommodate U.S. dependent youth interested in participating in CAP. U.S. Air Force
  installations are encouraged to host squadrons on installations outside the United States, its
  territories, and possessions. CAP senior members may join these squadrons, but only to
  support CAP cadet activities.
     3.13.3.1. Eligibility for Membership. Membership in overseas squadrons is limited to
     individuals covered by the provisions of the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA).
     Individuals desiring membership must meet all other eligibility requirements as
     established by CAP.
     3.13.3.2. Establishing Overseas Squadrons. Installation commanders who want to
     establish an overseas cadet squadron should appoint, in writing, an active duty
     commissioned officer to assist in forming the squadron, and request a charter for the
     squadron from CAP National Headquarters.
     3.13.3.3. Wear of CAP Uniform. Wear of the CAP uniform is optional for cadets in
     overseas squadrons. The uniform will not be worn off base unless the squadron is
     participating in drill competition, parades, and so forth, and the installation commander
     has given the squadron written permission.
     3.13.3.4. Authorized Programs and Activities. The programs and activities of overseas
     squadrons will conform to DOD policies and regulations and applicable international
     agreements and host nation laws.             Overseas CAP squadrons are restricted to
     administering cadet programs. They will not perform any other missions, or possess
     CAP vehicles or CAP aircraft. Participation in off-base activities requires the approval of
     the installation commander. Squadrons may only participate in flying activities that are
     otherwise permitted by DOD policies, international agreements, and host nation laws
     (e.g., flights in base aero club aircraft). Squadrons must obtain approval for other flying
     activities from CAP-USAF/CC.
  3.13.4. Credit for Advancement in CAP Cadet Program. IAW AFI 36-2002, Regular Air
  Force and Special Category Accessions, paragraph A4.1.5.5., cadets who earn the General
  Billy Mitchell Award, Amelia Earhart Award, or General Carl A. Spaatz Award, or when the
  CAP-USAF/CC submits a letter certifying a cadet’s successful completion of the award, if
  otherwise qualified, will be eligible to enlist in the Air Force, Air Force Reserve, or Air
  National Guard in the pay grade of E-3. The General Billy Mitchell, Amelia Earhart, or
  General Carl A. Spaatz Awards will entitle cadets to academic credits if enrolled in the Air
  Force Reserve Officer Training Corps. These three awards, or certifying letter, will also be
  viewed favorably by the U.S. Air Force Academy and AFROTC in the admissions process.
  Finally, the Air Force Academy will appoint at least one qualified CAP cadet to the Air
  Force Academy Preparatory School annually from a list of nominees provided by CAP
  National Headquarters. (T-3).
  3.13.5. International Air Cadet Exchange (IACE). CAP is the official United States member
  of the IACE program, an international program designed to foster international goodwill
AFI10-2701 31 JULY 2014                                                                        31


   through common interests in aviation shared by the youth of participating nations. Each year
   CAP exchanges cadets with similar organizations in Canada, Europe, and the East
   Asia/Pacific area. This program is consistent with Air Force missions and objectives.
   Foreign national exchange cadets are considered participants in a DOD-sanctioned program
   for the purposes of DOD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation Eligibility.
3.14. Installation Support for CAP Aerospace Education. Air Force installations and units
are authorized to provide limited support to CAP aerospace education activities and are
encouraged to provide such support in accordance with paragraphs 3.2.3. and 3.7.2. of this
Instruction. Such support includes providing personnel as instructors for aerospace workshops,
providing tours of installations and units focusing on applicable aspects of aerospace endeavors,
presenting briefings on installation and unit mission and capabilities from an aerospace
perspective and providing instruction in Air Force roles and missions and its relationship to
aerospace supremacy.
3.15. Orientation Flights in Air Force Aircraft. The Air Force may provide CAP cadets and
senior members with orientation flights in Air Force aircraft. Such flights can be included as
part of planned or scheduled training and operational flight missions in accordance with AFI 11-
401, Aviation Management. Air Force personnel should consider the purpose of any scheduled
or planned flight activities and their suitability as orientation flights.
3.16. Airlift Support. Airlift support is permitted for official CAP activities in accordance with
DOD 4515.13-R, Chapter 2, and must be approved by CAP-USAF/CC or the designee. (T-2).
3.17. Use of DOD Medical Facilities. CAP personnel incurring an injury or illness during an
AFAM are entitled to limited military medical care in accordance with AFI 41-210, Tricare
Operations and Patient Administration Functions. CAP personnel participating in an official
function on a military installation may be entitled to emergency medical care, like any other
civilian, in accordance with AFI 41-210.
3.18. Use of Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) Facilities. In accordance with
AFI 34-211(I) (AR 215-8), Army and Air Force Exchange Service Operations, Table 7-2, CAP
personnel, while participating in an AFAM or official function on a travel authorization and
occupying government quarters on a DOD installation, are entitled to the use of AAFES facilities
and services. Senior members and cadets seeking AAFES services are subject to the restrictions
and exceptions of Table 7-2.
3.19. Installation Commander Discretion. To the extent allowed by law, installation
commanders may exercise their discretion in determining whether access to facilities and
services described in this Instruction should be further limited.
3.20. Training Support.
   3.20.1. Space Available Training Opportunities. All CAP members may, at their own
   expense, attend training programs offered at DOD Installations. FTCA/FECA does not
   extend to this activity. Such training will be offered for CAP personnel on a space available
   basis at no additional cost to the Government. CAP-USAF/CC and the training activity
   commander must approve the request prior to CAP participation. (T-3). Examples of such
   programs include aerospace physiological training in accordance with AFI 11-401, TSR
   training, etc.

   3.20.2. Other Training Activities. Air Force installations and units are authorized to provide
   support to CAP senior member training activities and are encouraged to provide such support
   whenever possible. Such support includes providing personnel as instructors for leadership,
   aerospace, and operational courses and workshops, providing tours of installations and units,
   briefings on installation and unit mission and capabilities, and instruction in Air Force roles
   and missions and the role of CAP as an auxiliary of the Air Force. AU may provide
   administrative support to CAP members enrolled in both Air Force and CAP Professional
   Military Education (PME).
3.21. Communications Management. CAP uses Air Force or DOD assigned frequencies for
operation of the CAP communications network. The Air Force Spectrum Management Office
(AFSMO) provides frequency management support to CAP through AETC. CAP fixed
communications equipment, such as repeaters and antennas, are authorized to be placed on DOD
facilities.

            HISTORY AND ORGANIZATION OF THE CIVIL AIR PATROL

A2.1. The Civil Air Patrol (CAP), an organization chartered by Congress as a non-profit
corporation, may also act as a volunteer civilian auxiliary of the Air Force. This section
describes the origin and history of CAP, CAP operation as a non-profit corporation, its
membership, its organization, and its capabilities to support the Air Force. This Attachment is
provided for informational purposes only. It does not establish any policy, or confer any
entitlement or benefits concerning CAP. In the event of a conflict between the information
contained in this Attachment and other governing documents, including statutes, those
documents will take precedence over this Attachment.
   A2.1.1. Origins and History. Since its inception, CAP has been closely associated with the
   Air Force. CAP was not originally envisioned as a permanent organization affiliated with a
   military department. Its establishment as an auxiliary of the Air Force came after several
   years of effort on the part of both the Air Force and CAP.
       A2.1.1.1. Creation as a Temporary Civilian Auxiliary. CAP was established by order of
       the Director of Civilian Defense on 1 December 1941 as an organization under the Office
       of Civilian Defense under the command of Army Air Force personnel. The purpose of
       CAP was to enable the use of general aviation pilots and aircraft in support of the
       nation’s civilian defense program. It was created under authority for the use of civilian
       auxiliaries to meet the state of national emergency declared by Congress following the
       outbreak of World War II and was authorized for the period of the national emergency.
       A2.1.1.2. Service in World War II. Upon entry of the United States into World War II,
       the mission of CAP expanded, with CAP performing a wide variety of duties including
       coastal patrol for submarine activity, ships and personnel in distress, target towing for the
       Armed Forces, and courier flights for essential personnel and war materials. By
       Executive Order, CAP was transferred on 29 April 1943 from the Office of Civilian
       Defense to the Department of War. On              4 May 1943, CAP was placed under the
       control of the Army Air Forces. During this period CAP was referred to as an auxiliary
       of the Army Air Force.
   A2.1.1.3. Congressional Charter as a Non-Profit Corporation. At the end of the war, the
   state of national emergency that gave the legal authority for the existence of CAP was
   terminated. The Army Air Force continued to provide limited assistance to CAP, including
   leadership by Army Air Force personnel. At the urging of the senior leaders of the Army Air
   Force and prominent members of the aviation community, CAP was chartered by act of
   Congress on 1 July 1946 as a non-profit corporation to enable CAP to continue to provide its
   services to the armed forces and the Nation.
       A2.1.1.4. Establishment as an Auxiliary of the Air Force. Although Congress chartered
       CAP as a non-profit corporation, the Air Force lacked the legal basis to provide CAP
       with assistance, advice, and oversight and to authorize the Air Force to use the services of
       CAP. With the strong backing of the Secretary of the Air Force and the Chief of Staff of
       the Air Force, Congress designated CAP as an auxiliary of the Air Force on 26 May
       1948. This act authorized the SECAF to accept and utilize the services of CAP in the
       fulfillment of the non-combat missions of the Air Force.
38                                                                 AFI10-2701 31 JULY 2014


     A2.1.1.5. Recent Actions. In 2000, three fundamental changes for CAP occurred. First,
     in the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act of FY01, Public Law 106-
     398, Congress clarified their language regarding Auxiliary status as a temporary
     condition only existing while CAP is executing missions for “any department or agency
     in any branch of the federal government.” Second, in this same bill, Congress created the
     CAP BOG. This 11-member board was tasked to be “the governing body of the Civil Air
     Patrol” and given broad authority to “exercise the powers granted to the Civil Air Patrol”
     including the power to adopt or amend the Constitution and Bylaws of CAP.
     Additionally, on 10 July 2000 the Air Force and CAP entered into a Cooperative
     Agreement, ensuring Air Force support to CAP was provided in accordance with the
     principles defined in DoD 3210.6-R. Most recently, in 2012, the CAP BOG in concert
     with the volunteer Governance Committee undertook a full review of CAP’s governance
     to include its Constitution, Bylaws and regulations. In August 2012, the BOG announced
     changes to streamline the organization’s decision and policymaking processes; clarify the
     role and responsibilities of key personnel; incorporate a new selection process for CAP’s
     national commander and other executives; change the composition of the CAP
     membership on the BOG; and extend indemnification to all CAP members who were
     previously indemnified. The changes also renamed and redefined the roles of CAP’s
     other governing bodies formerly known as the National Board and the National Executive
     Committee. These two new bodies were renamed to the CAP Command Council and the
     CAP Senior Advisory Group, respectively, and are no longer governing bodies for the
     Corporation.
     A2.1.1.6. CAP Operation as a Non-profit Corporation. Per 36 U.S.C. §§ 40301-40307,
     CAP is a congressionally chartered non-profit corporation. As a non-profit corporation,
     CAP has a Constitution and Bylaws governing its operation and a governing body to
     control its operation as a non-profit corporation under Air Force oversight (pursuant to 10
     U.S.C., Chapter 909) and regulation as necessary. Consistent with law and federal
     regulations, CAP controls its administration and establishes its policies, such as the
     criteria for membership in CAP, the location, types and size of its units, etc.
  A2.1.2. CAP Objectives: The following are CAP objectives as a corporation:
     A2.1.2.1. To provide an organization to encourage and aid American citizens in the
     contribution of their efforts, services, and resources in the development of aviation and in
     the maintenance of aerospace supremacy.
     A2.1.2.2. To encourage and develop, by example, the voluntary contribution of private
     citizens to the public welfare.
     A2.1.2.3. To provide aviation and aerospace education and training, especially to its
     senior and cadet members.
     A2.1.2.4. To encourage and foster civil aviation in local communities.
     A2.1.2.5. To provide an organization of private citizens with adequate facilities to assist
     in meeting local and national emergencies.
     A2.1.2.6. To assist the Department of the Air Force in fulfilling its noncombat programs
     and missions.
AFI10-2701 31 JULY 2014                                                                    39


  A2.1.3. CAP Corporation Relationship to the Federal Government. CAP is not a
  government entity although chartered as a non-profit corporation by Congress.
     A2.1.3.1. CAP Governing Body. The BOG is the governing body of the CAP
     Corporation. CAP controls its administration as a corporation through the BOG. The
     BOG is composed of four members appointed by the SECAF, four members selected by
     CAP, and three members from “interested organizations” jointly selected by the SECAF
     and CAP. The BOG has the authority to do any act necessary and proper to carry out the
     purposes of the corporation, including adopting and amending the CAP Constitution and
     Bylaws. In practice, the BOG serves as the strategic policy making and guidance body
     for CAP by reviewing and determining long-range plans and programs. The BOG also
     serves as a pool of expert advisors and oversees the CAP Inspector General and
     Membership Action Review Panel. A detailed description of the CAP BOG is contained
     in AFI 10-2702, Board of Governors of the Civil Air Patrol.
     A2.1.3.2. CAP Senior Advisory Group. The Senior Advisory Group is an advisory body
     to the CAP National Commander. It is comprised of 14 members including the CAP
     National Commander, CAP National Vice Commander, the National Chief of Staff, and
     CAP region commanders. The CAP-USAF Commander, Chief Operating Officer (COO)
     and Command Chief Master Sergeant are non-voting members. This group recommends
     policy and proposes amendments to the Constitution and Bylaws to the BOG.
     A2.1.3.3. CAP Corporate Officers. CAP has corporate officers similar to other
     corporations. Corporate officers are designated in the CAP Constitution and Bylaws.
     Corporate officers have the authority to obligate the CAP Corporation as provided for in
     the CAP Constitution, Bylaws, and regulations. The corporate officers include the CAP
     National Commander and National Vice Commander, CAP COO, CAP Chief Financial
     Officer and the CAP General Counsel. The CAP Corporation indemnifies CAP corporate
     officers for activities within the scope of their responsibilities.
        A2.1.3.3.1. CAP National Commander. The National Commander is the commander
        of CAP and serves as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Corporation. The
        CAP BOG selects the CAP National Commander based on criteria defined by the
        BOG-established Personnel Committee. He/She is responsible for overall control of
        the organization and reports directly to the BOG.        The basic duties and
        responsibilities are contained in the CAP Constitution and Bylaws. The CAP
        National Commander holds the grade of CAP Major General.
        A2.1.3.3.2. CAP National Vice Commander. The CAP National Vice Commander is
        selected by the National Commander and confirmed by majority vote of the BOG.
        The National Vice Commander acts as assistant to the National Commander and
        focuses his/her efforts on the daily mission of the volunteer force of CAP. The
        National Vice Commander holds the grade of CAP Brigadier General.
        A2.1.3.3.3. CAP Chief Operating Officer (COO). Formerly the CAP Executive
        Director, the COO is the senior paid corporate employee, serves as Executive
        Secretary to the BOG, represents the BOG at National Headquarters, and administers
        the daily affairs of the Corporation. The CAP COO Officer is selected, retained,
        evaluated and removed by the CAP BOG. The CAP COO serves at the pleasure of
        the BOG and fulfills the duties and responsibilities as defined in CAP’s Constitution,
40                                                                 AFI10-2701 31 JULY 2014


        Bylaws and regulations. The staff of the CAP National Headquarters works under the
        direction of the COO and includes such functional areas as General Counsel,
        Financial Management, Inspector General, Education, Information Technology,
        Logistics, Operations, and Safety. The COO is an advisor to the CAP Command
        Council and a non-voting member of the Senior Advisory Group.
        A2.1.3.3.4. CAP Chief Financial Officer (CFO). The Chief Financial Officer is
        selected by the COO, in coordination with the CEO, and approved by the BOG. The
        CFO serves at the pleasure of the Corporation and fulfills the duties and
        responsibilities as defined in CAP’s Constitution, Bylaws and regulations. The CFO
        is a CAP Corporate Officer and serves as the Corporation’s Treasurer, the financial
        advisor to the BOG, and Chairman of the National Finance Committee.
        A2.1.3.3.5. CAP General Counsel (GC). The CAP General Counsel is selected by
        the COO, in coordination with the CEO, and approved by the BOG. The GC serves
        at the pleasure of the Corporation and fulfills the duties and responsibilities as defined
        in CAP’s Constitution, Bylaws and regulations. The GC is a CAP Corporate Officer
        and also serves as the Corporation’s principal legal officer, Secretary of the
        Corporation, and senior risk manager.
        A2.1.3.3.6. Field Level Senior Officers. CAP field level senior officers are the
        region commanders and wing commanders. The National Commander appoints
        region commanders and region commanders appoint the wing commanders. Their
        duties are contained in CAP regulations.
     A2.1.3.4. Constitution, Bylaws, and Regulations. The administration of the activities,
     business, and affairs of the CAP Corporation are controlled by its Constitution, Bylaws,
     and regulations. These documents guide the CAP membership in carrying out the
     purposes and objectives of the Corporation. CAP regulations are numbered after the old-
     style Air Force regulations and detail how CAP operates. The Air Force may regulate
     corporate activities to the extent determined by the Secretary of the Air Force.
     A2.1.3.5. CAP Members. CAP members are private citizens who volunteer, without
     remuneration, their time, services, and resources to accomplish the purposes and
     objectives of CAP. CAP controls the categories and criteria for membership in their
     organization. CAP members, with certain exceptions, must pay dues on an annual basis.
     CAP membership, with exceptions, is renewed on an annual basis. Membership in CAP
     consists primarily of adult members that CAP refers to as senior members and youth
     members referred to as cadets. There are no physical requirements for membership in
     CAP, and physically challenged individuals can be found among both their senior and
     cadet members. Unless otherwise stated, CAP members referred to in this Air Force
     Instruction are CAP senior members.
     A2.1.3.6. Senior Members. CAP senior membership is open to United States citizens or
     resident aliens over the age of 18 with no maximum age limit. Within the senior
     membership there are subcategories including life membership and retired membership.
     Active duty, reserve, National Guard, or retired members of the armed forces are eligible
     to join as CAP senior members.
AFI10-2701 31 JULY 2014                                                                   41


     A2.1.3.7. Cadet Members. CAP cadet membership is open to young men and women
     who are United States citizens or resident aliens. In order to join CAP, these young men
     and women must be twelve through eighteen years of age. Once a member, they have the
     option to remain in the CAP cadet program until their twenty-first birthday. CAP cadets
     who become members of the active duty armed forces lose their eligibility to remain in
     the CAP cadet program and must transfer to senior member status should they desire to
     maintain their CAP membership.
     A2.1.3.8. Volunteer Workforce.       CAP organizations below the CAP National
     Headquarters have very few full-time personnel. CAP members are unpaid volunteers
     who give their time to accomplish CAP purposes and objectives. CAP units typically
     meet in the evenings during the week or on weekends, similar to Air Reserve Component
     units. CAP members may have to take time away from work, school, etc. to deal with
     Air Force units and personnel during the normal duty day, attend training, or carry out
     Air Force-assigned missions. The ability of CAP personnel to provide quick response to
     non-emergency meetings or activities must be taken into account when providing support
     to or using CAP units and personnel.
     A2.1.3.9. Voluntary Adherence to CAP Rules and Regulations. Since CAP members are
     non-paid volunteers who do not formally "enlist" or otherwise commit themselves for
     service in CAP, CAP commanders at all levels of the organization are limited in how they
     can deal with members who fail to adhere to CAP rules and regulations. CAP, as a
     civilian, non-profit corporation, has no equivalent to the Uniform Code of Military
     Justice and guidelines on standards of personal conduct are very broad and general in
     nature. However, CAP regulations are very strict on aircraft and vehicle operations,
     safety, proper accountability of equipment, and protection of cadet members. CAP
     members voluntarily adhere to CAP regulations. Failure to adhere to regulations can
     result in termination or denial of CAP membership.
     A2.1.3.10. Grade Structure. CAP uses a military style grade (an officer and non-
     commissioned officer rank structure) for both its Senior Members and Cadet Members.
     CAP grades for both their senior members and cadets have no military standing, carry no
     authority over members of the Armed Forces, nor warrant the customs and courtesies
     afforded military members. Appointment and promotion follow guidelines contained
     within CAP regulations.
  A2.1.4. Organization. CAP units are organized primarily along a geographic basis that was
  used during World War II. The national organization is divided into 8 CAP regions and 52
  CAP wings. The CAP wings consist of the 50 states, the District of Columbia and the
  Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The organizational structure of
  CAP loosely follows the structure used by the Air Force. CAP controls the number and types
  of units in its organization. A current CAP member in good standing commands each CAP
  organizational element. The current organizational structure of CAP appears in Figure A2.1.

      A2.1.4.1. CAP National Headquarters. The CAP National Headquarters is the principle
      administrative organization within CAP. This is the only organization within CAP that
      has a full time paid staff except for the CAP Wing Administrators.
      A2.1.4.2. CAP Regions. Each of the eight CAP regions consists of from five to nine
      CAP wings in a geographic region of the nation. A CAP member in the grade of CAP
      Colonel commands each region. Each region has an administrative headquarters unit.
      The CAP National Commander appoints the region commanders. The current
      composition of the eight CAP regions and 52 wings appears in Figure A2.2.

Figure A2.2. CAP Regions and Wings




      A2.1.4.3. CAP Wings. Each CAP wing is organized within the geographic boundaries
      of the 50 states, the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the
      U.S. Virgin Islands under the purview of the Puerto Rico Wing. Wings take their origin
      from World War II when the defense forces within each state and Commonwealth were
      organized into a State Area Command. The number of senior and cadet members in a
      wing range from several hundred to over 4000. A member in the grade of CAP Colonel
      commands each wing. Each wing has a headquarters unit for administration. A wing
      may be further organized into groups, squadrons, and flights. Region commanders
      appoint the wing commanders within their region.
      A2.1.4.4. CAP Groups. CAP wings may organize squadrons into groups. A group is
      organized to cover a geographic area of a wing. The number of senior and cadet
      members in a group typically ranges from 100 to over 300. CAP groups are typically
      commanded by a member in the grade of CAP Lieutenant Colonel. Each CAP group
      may have a headquarters unit for administration. The CAP wing commander appoints the
      group commanders within their wing.
      A2.1.4.5. CAP Squadrons. CAP squadrons range in size from less than twenty to over
      100 personnel. CAP squadrons may be organized on a geographic or functional basis, or
      both. There are three types of CAP squadrons. CAP senior squadrons consist entirely of
      CAP senior members and tend to be orientated towards the operational missions of CAP.
      CAP cadet squadrons carry out the CAP cadet program and consist mostly of CAP cadets
      with a small number of CAP senior members to provide guidance and oversight. CAP

     composite squadrons are comprised of both cadets and senior members. A member
     typically in the grade of CAP Major or CAP Lieutenant Colonel commands a CAP
     squadron. The wing commander appoints squadron commanders within their commands.
     A2.1.4.6. CAP Flights. CAP flights are established in areas where there are insufficient
     numbers of senior or cadet members to form a squadron. Flights are organized on the
     same basis and types as squadrons. Flights may be attached to other squadrons or report
     directly to groups or wings. A member typically in the grade of CAP Captain commands
     flights. The immediate CAP commander appoints CAP flight commanders.
