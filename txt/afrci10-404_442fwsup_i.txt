premises for a unit to mobilize and meet its wartime commitments, and disseminate information

     2.9.1. Ensure unit recall programs fall into the guidelines of this regulation.
     2.9.2. Establish Key Alerters in your unit based on geographic area (for comm. outage)

         2.9.2.1. (Added-442FW) Designate a minimum of two alerters for each contact
         group on the unit’s recall roster.

       2.9.6. Develop procedures for recall or mobilization under degraded communications
       conditions (comm-out).
       2.9.7. Maintain a specific alternate recall plan so that messengers can be sent to
       members’ homes if they cannot be contacted by phone (Comm. Outage).
       2.9.8. Ensure recall procedures include provisions for recall notifications to be made by
       unit members. (Units may establish contacts with local law enforcement, civil defense,
       Civil Air Patrol (CAP), and other local agencies for assistance in notifying personnel;
       however, these sources should not be considered the primary means of notification.
       During an actual comm-out situation, other priorities would probably limit the support
       these agencies could provide.) Alternate recall plans should be flexible. For example,
       the comm-out condition may only affect the base and immediate surrounding area. In
       some cases, contact via messenger may not be practical (for example, members who
       reside out of state or long distances from base).
       2.9.9. Become qualified through training from a certified ENS administrator (Command
       Post personnel), then maintain the ENS database for their respective unit by validating

       unit’s recall roster pyramid with specific instructions for use by close of business on
       Sunday of the UTA.
    2.10. Unit Members will:
       2.10.1. Provide the following mandatory information: name, address, applicable phone
       numbers to include home, business, cellular, and email addresses. If home address is a
       post office box, maintain specific directions to the member’s home. Failure to do so can
       have an adverse effect on mobilization of the unit.
       2.10.2. Notify their unit recall program monitor with changes to address, phone numbers
       or email.
       2.10.3. Military members are required to provide up to date contact information via the
       Virtual Military Personnel Flight Application (vMPF). Civilian members who wish to
       provide personal contact information should do so using the ENS self service application.
       All members are responsible for the accuracy of their own contact
          2.10.3.1. (Added-442FW) Military members will set up a Personal Identification
          Number (PIN) in ENS. Straight civilian members who wish to provide personal
          contact information should also setup a PIN in ENS.
          2.10.3.2. (Added-442FW) Military members will update their contact information
          in the ENS self service application.
AFRCI10-404_442FWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2012                                                           7


   2.11. Unit Network Control Centers and CSTs will work with AFRC/A6N to ensure each
   AFRC workstation is loaded with the current version and correct PID of the IWS/Alerts
   client software. For AFRC tenant Wings/units, updates to the IWS Alerts desktop client will
   have to be coordinated with the host base MCCC and/or I-NOSC supporting the local base
   network
3. Recall Rosters.
   3.1. Units will create a pyramid notification system (recall roster) that includes specific
   instructions for use, notification types and phraseology, a pyramid notification system and
   Excel spreadsheet with information identified in para 2.10.1. (See attachment 4 for
   spreadsheet format.)
       3.1.1. Recall Pyramids. The pyramid recall system will utilize quality considerations
       such as: key alerters will have availability and access to communications necessary to
       make notifications; consider grouping all those who live in the same distant community
       and members who do not have a street address will provide brief directions to their
       homes.
          3.1.1.1. Group Pyramids will begin at the group and will include all assigned
          squadrons.
          3.1.1.2. Unit Pyramids will begin with the group and will include every individual in
          the unit to include civilians, traditional reservists, Air Reserve Technicians, and
          Active Guard and Reserve personnel.
   3.2. Recall rosters will:
       3.2.1. Include specific instructions for use, notification phraseology, pyramids, and Excel
       spreadsheets.
       3.2.2. Be responsive and cost effective when possible. Consolidate personnel by area
       and/or ZIP Code where practical.
       3.2.3. Specify alternate procedures in the event of the loss of primary communications.
       3.2.4. Comply with the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, Title 5, U.S.C., Section
       552a, as amended and AFI 33-332.
       3.2.5. Include procedures for reporting results of an actual or test notification to the
       recall program monitor for timely reporting. See paragraph 6 for reporting procedures.
       3.2.6. Consider operations security (OPSEC) in all actions.
       3.2.7. Recall rosters will identify personnel essential to the unit in the event a Type 2
       Essential Personnel Recall is initiated.
4. Notification System.
   4.1. The unit commander is responsible for contacting assigned personnel as follows. Recall
   should not stop until 100 percent notification.
   4.2. The Command Post will initiate unit recalls via ENS as the primary means with manual
   telephones being an alternate means. Unless absolutely essential to the mission, do not use
8                                           AFRCI10-404_442FWSUP_I 19 OCTOBER 2012


    radio, television, or newspapers to notify individuals of an alert to mobilize until DoD has
    provided detailed information to Congress and the public.
       4.2.1. (Added-442FW) When manual telephone or alternate means is used; the 442
       FW/CP will notify the unit commander and a key alerter of each unit required to be
       alerted from the following subordinate units: 442 FW Staff, 442d Operations Group,
       442d Mission Support Group, 442d Maintenance Group, 442 MDS, 476th Fighter Group,
       917th Fighter Group, and 924th Fighter Group. The contacted key alerter will initiate the
       recall for their unit.
    4.3. Upon direction from AFRC Public Affairs, the Wing Commander will use the news
    media to expedite recall. The unit public affairs office provides guidance and assistance
    concerning the release of this information.
    4.4. When notifying unit members, relay the message directly to the member. (PIN
    validation will suffice when ENS is used.) Messages to co-workers, family members,
    answering machines, etc., do not constitute contact.
    4.5. Notification Types. The types of recalls/notifications listed below will be created in the
    ENS.
       4.5.1. TYPE 1: ALL PERSONNEL RECALL. All civilian and military personnel
       report to duty section by __________. Script: This is (name and organization) with a
