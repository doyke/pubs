                                          Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL GUIDANCE

1.1. Scope. This volume establishes general procedures for RQ-4 operations. Use it in
conjunction with aircraft flight manuals, Department of Defense (DOD) Flight Information
Publication (FLIP), and applicable USAF directives and instructions. Basic source directives
have precedence in the case of any conflicts, matters of interpretation or revisions.
   1.1.1. Pilots will comply with operating provisions specified in Federal Aviation
   Administration (FAA) Certificates of Waiver, Certificates of Authorization (COA) or
   Memoranda of Agreement (MOA) for operations within or through the United States (US)
   National Airspace System (NAS). Pilots will comply with operating provisions specified in
   host-nation agreements (HNA) for operations within another nation’s airspace.
   1.1.2. Training units may develop phase manuals from procedures contained in relevant
   documents such as Unit Phase Manuals, Wing Operating Instructions, or Technical Orders.
   Phase manuals may expand on basic procedures, but they will not be less restrictive than
   flight manuals and applicable Air Force Instructions (AFI). Operational units may use phase
   manuals to augment mission qualification and continuation training.
   1.1.3. RQ-4 air vehicles modified to carry the Battlefield Airborne Communications Node
   (BACN) payload have been provided the Mission Design Series (MDS) nomenclature of EQ-
   4. Unless otherwise indicated, the procedures in this manual universally apply to RQ-4 and
   EQ-4 systems and crewmembers.
1.2. Crewmember Responsibility. In conjunction with other governing directives and AFIs,
this volume prescribes procedures for RQ-4 operations under most circumstances, but it is not a
substitute for sound judgment or common sense. Refer to Table 2.1 for additional RQ-4 specific
guidance.
   1.2.1. Pilot in Command (PIC). The PIC is the final authority as to the operation of the
   system (air vehicle and ground station), with authority and responsibility as defined in AFI
   11-202V3. During terminal area operations, the Launch-and-Recovery Element (LRE) pilot
   is the PIC. Outside the terminal area, the Mission Control Element (MCE) pilot is the PIC.
   During single ground station operations, that ground station pilot retains all PIC authority.
   The terminal area is defined as an 80 nautical mile (NM) radius ring surrounding the
   departure/arrival airfield, unless defined otherwise by MAJCOM, AF component and/or local
   operating supplements.
   1.2.2. Mission Commander (MC). The MCE pilot is the MC for all operational flights, and
   is responsible for overall mission accomplishment. The MC coordinates with the Global
   Hawk Operations Center (GHOC), the Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) liaison
   officer (LNO), the Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (PED) unit, and supported
   units to ensure mission objectives are met. Due to the RQ-4’s endurance, MCs will routinely
   change out during the course of the mission.
   1.2.3. MCE Sensor Operator (MCE-SO). MCE-SO is responsible for ISR mission
   collection planning, mission management, sensor monitoring and tasking. The MCE-SO will
   coordinate with the pilot, AOC LNO, exploitation units, supported units, and GHOC Sensor
 6                                                             AFI11-2RQ-4V3 16 APRIL 2013


     Operator (GHOC-SO) to ensure understanding of collection priorities and flow. The MCE-
     SO is responsible for monitoring image quality, the automatic or manual imagery
     dissemination, and assisting the pilot as required with checklists and available crew aids.
     1.2.4. Hawkeye. The Hawkeye will be trained and current in Hawkeye duties, and will brief
     with the crew prior to takeoff or landing operations. Hawkeye is responsible for:
        1.2.4.1. Verifying the aircraft is properly configured for each phase of ground
        movement, takeoff and landing.
        1.2.4.2. Visually clearing appropriate taxiways and runway areas prior to and during taxi,
        takeoff and landing operations.
        1.2.4.3. Alerting the PIC of any required corrective action.
        1.2.4.4. Maintaining two-way voice communications with the PIC in order to maintain
        safe ground operations prior to launch, and after landing until engine shutdown and
        ground safety pin insertion.
1.3. GHOC Responsibility. A GHOC is required for all operational and exercise missions.
The GHOC serves as a filter for information flow from outside organizations into the MCE
and/or LRE, and serves as the central coordinating node for command-and-control (C2)
agencies/units, PED units, LNOs, supported units, and users. The GHOC also oversees and
coordinates mission planning and mission conduct for single or multiple missions, and assists in
de-conflicting airspace with other high-altitude (HA) assets.
     1.3.1. GHOC Pilot. The GHOC pilot is responsible for overall management of GHOC
     operations, and assists the MC in mission accomplishment. During actual flight operations,
     the GHOC pilot must be a Combat Mission Ready (CMR) or Basic Mission Capable (BMC)
     RQ-4 pilot. The GHOC pilot is the focal point for all mission communications not requiring
     direct communications with the MC, and ensures appropriate mission-relevant
     information/requests are provided to the MC during mission execution. The SQ/DO may
     allow one GHOC Pilot to assist multiple MCs simultaneously.
     1.3.2. GHOC SO: The GHOC-SO is responsible for supporting mission collection planning
     and management, and must be properly trained to perform required duties. The GHOC-SO
     coordinates with the MC, MCE-SO, AOC LNO, PED units and supported units to constantly
     maintain awareness and understanding of collection priorities and flow. In addition, the
     GHOC-SO ensures collection/satisfaction of tasked targets, modifies target decks and assists
     the GHOC pilot as required with checklists and available crew aids.
     1.3.3. GHOC Intelligence Support. The GHOC intelligence support position provides the
     GHOC pilot with intelligence updates, as required.
1.4. Crew Complement.
     1.4.1. Pilot. The minimum crew of one current/qualified pilot is required per ground station
     with an active aircraft link.
     1.4.2. Sensor Operator. One current/qualified SO is required in the MCE, when necessary
     to monitor/control sensors.
1.5. Essential Ground Personnel.
AFI11-2RQ-4V3 16 APRIL 2013                                                                     7


   1.5.1. GHOC. Minimum personnel required are a GHOC pilot and GHOC SO for
   operational missions and exercises.
   1.5.2. Hawkeye. A Hawkeye is required for all normal taxi, takeoff and landing operations
   (waiver authority is the OG/CC).
   1.5.3. Maintenance Personnel.

                                            Chapter 2

                             MISSION PLANNING & BRIEFING

2.1. General. This chapter standardizes procedures for planning, reviewing and briefing all
missions.
2.2. Responsibility. Crewmembers (LRE and MCE), GHOC personnel and the AOC LNO
jointly share responsibility for mission planning, but the MC is ultimately responsible for the
accuracy and completeness of the mission plan.
     2.2.1. Unit commanders will ensure currency of all mission planning materials and
     compliance with command guidance. Unit operations officers will schedule adequate
     mission planning time prior to flight.
     2.2.2. Crewmembers not scheduled to fly a mission may be utilized to accomplish mission
     planning. If operationally necessary, mission elements and events may be modified the day
     of a flight or while the air vehicle is airborne as long as changes do not compromise flight
     safety. The MC will ensure all crewmembers acknowledge any changes.
     2.2.3. Crews will complete sufficient mission planning prior to flight to ensure safe mission
     accomplishment. As a minimum, planning will cover weather, fuel requirements, takeoff and
     landing data, mission objectives, threat study (to include available sources for threat
     warning), departure and arrival procedures (to include thorough contingency route planning),
     communications, and collection plans.
     2.2.4. For operations within or through the US NAS crews will ensure the projected flight
     path, including divert and alternate contingencies, meets the specifications of the FAA-
     approved MOA and/or COA.
     2.2.5. Participation in contingency operations normally requires the GHOC to establish
     procedures for coordinating mission requirements, collection plans, and Air Tasking Order
     (ATO) inputs/changes with the designated AOC. The GHOC pilot, SO, and intelligence
     support functions are jointly responsible for briefing crewmembers on special requirements
     and/or tasking updates prior to and during each mission. The MC is responsible for adhering
     to appropriate guidance including, but not limited to, special instructions (SPINS),
     communications plans, Airspace Control Orders (ACO) and any other command guidance
     relevant to in-theater operations.
     2.2.6. Crew substitutions require Squadron Operations Supervisor approval, and will be
     made with sufficient time for the substitute crewmember to plan and be briefed on the
     mission.
     2.2.7. Pilots will thoroughly review the navigation plan prior to acting as PIC. This includes
     review of all action points, contingency routes, and possible alternate and diverts landing
     fields applicable to the phase of flight.
2.3. Required Publications. Crewmembers will ensure they have the most recent Technical
Order (TO) guidance, as released by Flight Crew Information File (FCIF). In addition,
crewmembers will either carry a hardcopy of the following guidance, or have immediate
AFI11-2RQ-4V3 16 APRIL 2013                                                                     9


electronic access to the guidance; on all missions (units may supplement this list as appropriate
to meet operational needs):

Table 2.1. Additional RQ-4 AFI Guidance.
     AFI 11-202 Volume 3 (and MAJCOM Sup)                General Flight Rules
     AFI 11-2RQ-4 Volume 3                               RQ-4 Operations Procedures
     AFI 11-2RQ-4 Volume 1 (Instructors Only)            RQ-4 Crew Training
     AFI 11-2RQ-4 Volume 2 (Evaluators Only)             RQ-4 Crew Evaluation Criteria
2.4. Enroute Charts and Approach Procedures.
   2.4.1. Local Area Maps. A local area map of sufficient detail to remain within assigned
   training areas and identify potential emergency landing airfields will be available for display
   on the MCE and LRE monitors.
   2.4.2. Mission Maps and Navigation Route Maps. Pilots will display the appropriate
   current charts on the MCE and LRE monitors throughout the mission. Charts will be of
   sufficient scale to provide navigation, terrain and obstacle avoidance information appropriate
   to the phase of flight.
   2.4.3. Map Currency. Units will conduct operations with current charts and Digital
   Aeronautical Flight Information File (DAFIF) data, and will establish procedures with
   maintenance units and support contractors to ensure required software, chart and DAFIF
   updates are simultaneously applied to ground stations, Pilot Stand-Alone Trainers (PSAT)
   and flight planning workstations.
   2.4.4. Publications. Units will ensure current FLIP is maintained in the MCE and LRE.
   2.4.5. Flight Logs. RQ-4 pilots may use the computer-generated mission flight plan log in
   lieu of an AF Form 70, Pilot’s Flight Plan and Flight Log.
2.5. Approach, Departure, and Go-Around. All RQ-4 approaches, departures and go-arounds
will be developed using the appropriate flight planning workstation.
   2.5.1. Approach and Go-Around. Since the RQ-4 utilizes self-contained GPS approaches,
   traditional TERPS evaluation criteria are not applicable to the standard RQ-4 flight profile.
   2.5.2. Approach and Go-Around Approval Process.
       2.5.2.1. For airfields at which one or more IAPs are available, build RQ-4 approaches
       and go-arounds to overlay the IAP(s) and verify obstacle clearance. Approving authority
       for use is the OG/CC.
       2.5.2.2. For airfields at which there are no IAPs available, a formal request must be
       submitted IAW AFI 11-230, Instrument Procedures, to have an IAP constructed. If the
       airfield is needed for immediate use to support an operational mission, a MAJCOM/A3
       (or COMAFFOR) waiver is required for temporary use until the appropriate IAP is built.
   2.5.3. Review Cycle. With each new release of FLIP (including Terminal Change Notices
   (TCNs)), IAPs underlying RQ-4 approach and go-around procedures will be reviewed by
   mission planners to verify there are no changes in obstacle clearance data requiring
   modification of the RQ-4 approach and go-around procedure. Units will document
   accomplishment of FLIP reviews.

   2.5.4. Prior to flight, the PIC will review each RQ-4 approach and go-around for the planned
   route of flight. At a minimum, each PIC is responsible for reviewing that segment of the
   mission for which he/she is responsible.
2.6. Airfields.
   2.6.1. Airfield Approval Process. The approving authority for airfield use is the geographic
   MAJCOM/A3. Use is defined as any airfield’s approach incorporated into preplanned
   mission, autonomous primary or contingency logic. In combatant commander (COCOM)
   theaters with no MAJCOM, the approving authority for airfield use is COMAFFOR (or as
   delegated, not lower than the COMAFFOR/A3). For airfields within the continental United
   States (CONUS) and Canada, the ACC/A3 is the approving authority.
       2.6.1.1. Operating units will reference the guidance in Attachment 2 to develop a list of
       airfields of intended use. Present the list, with airfield ratings and level of intended use,
       to the MAJCOM/A3 (or COMAFFOR).
       2.6.1.2. Operating units will coordinate with the appropriate airfield, ATC and host
       nation agencies based on the level of intended use (normal, alternate or “stitched”
       emergency airfield). See Attachment 9.
       2.6.1.3. Operating unit OG/CCs will provide coordination documentation to the relevant
       MAJCOM/A3 (or COMAFFOR), with a copy to the ACC/A3 as the lead command.
       Documentation will include results of the airfield evaluation and all coordination actions
       accomplished.
       2.6.1.4. MAJCOM/A3 (or COMAFFOR) will approve or disapprove airfields, as
       necessary.
   2.6.2. Normal Airfields. Normal airfields are defined as those where routine RQ-4
   operations occur. Prior to commencing operations at a normal airfield, operating units will:
       2.6.2.1. Coordinate flight operations, to include routings, emergency procedures and loss
       of C2 (i.e. “lost link”) procedures. Departure, arrival and go-around routings will be
       coordinated with the servicing air traffic control (ATC) agencies.
       2.6.2.2. Coordinate with applicable on-base agencies to ensure provision of appropriate
       ground handling, maintenance and safety support for RQ-4 flight operations.
   2.6.3. Alternate Airfields. Alternate airfields are the desired point of landing when a normal
   airfield is not available, and no other emergency or threat to air vehicle safety exists. See
   Attachment 2 for reference in determining the suitability of an airfield for use as an alternate.
   Prior to utilizing an airfield as a designated alternate, operating units will:
       2.6.3.1. Coordinate all approach, go-around and departure procedures with the servicing
       ATC agencies.
       2.6.3.2. Establish notification procedures with alternate airfield C2 agencies (e.g.
       command post, wing operations center, base operations, etc.).
       2.6.3.3. Comply with provisions of paragraph 2.6.1. for airfield approval.
AFI11-2RQ-4V3 16 APRIL 2013                                                                       11


       2.6.3.4. Coordinate with applicable MAJCOM/A3 and on-base agencies to ensure
       provision of appropriate ground handling, maintenance and safety support for RQ-4
       operations, as required for level of intended use.
   2.6.4. Emergency Airfields. Emergency airfields will only be used when the situation
   dictates landing as soon as possible or the aircraft is not capable of safe flight to a primary or
   an alternate airfield. The reduced probability of such an occurrence allows for a reduced
   level of coordination in comparison to alternate airfields. See Attachment 2 for reference in
   determining the suitability of an airfield for use as an emergency airfield. Prior to utilizing
   an airfield as a designated (stitched) emergency airfield, operating units will:
       2.6.4.1. Ensure all preplanned routings avoid over flight of populated areas, to the
       maximum extent possible.
       2.6.4.2. Establish notification procedures and communications connectivity between the
       PIC, GHOC and appropriate emergency airfield agencies. Appropriate agencies will
       include those capable of ensuring the runway is clear of personnel/aircraft/equipment and
       providing landing clearance.
       2.6.4.3. Ensure all arrival routings established in the mission plan logic are approved by
       the OG/CC. Approval authority will not be delegated lower.
       2.6.4.4. Comply with provisions of paragraph 2.6.1. for airfield approval. Approval
       authority for actual use of an emergency airfield during flight is the PIC.
2.7. Termination Points. Termination points are designated ground impact points when it is
determined the air vehicle is not controllable for landing, or landing at a suitable airfield cannot
be made safely without undue risk to personnel or property on the ground. If the air vehicle is
not able to reach a designated termination point, the pilot will direct it to an unpopulated area and
initiate flight termination, or will allow it to crash on course.
   2.7.1. CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii and Guam. Approved areas for termination points are
   DOD ranges and DOD lands. Units will coordinate with the DOD range or land manager for
   specific termination point selection and establishment of notification procedures.
   2.7.2. Outside the CONUS and US territories. Termination point selection, coordination
   and approval will be managed through the MAJCOM or theater component. Units will not
   negotiate directly with host nation authorities unless authorized to do so by the MAJCOM or
   theater component.
   2.7.3. Over international or US territorial waters. For overwater flights where
   emergency divert airfields or overland termination points are not available, ditching is an
   acceptable alternative. Units will develop and document procedures to ensure selected ditch
   points avoid published commercial/military shipping lanes and offshore drilling platforms.
   2.7.4. Units will include approved termination points and notification procedures in their
   supplement to this instruction, or in local flying instructions.
2.8. Briefing/Debriefing Guides and Mission Checklists.
   2.8.1. Briefing Guides and Checklists. All items in the briefing guides must be addressed
   by the pilot or other members of the crew. Units may augment these guides as needed.
   Required checklist items are provided in Attachments 3 through 8.
12                                                          AFI11-2RQ-4V3 16 APRIL 2013


  2.8.2. Mission Brief. All items identified by Attachment 3 must be covered in all mission
  briefs.
  2.8.3. Crew Position Changeover. All items in Attachment 4 must be covered during
  changeover between outgoing and incoming crewmembers. The incoming crew will conduct
  a mission briefing with all essential personnel prior to stepping to the ground station. MCE
  crews will obtain mission updates from the GHOC pilot before going on shift. Prior to
  assuming control, individual crewmembers will complete a changeover brief for each crew
  position.
  2.8.4. Hawkeye Checklists. All items in Attachment 5 must be addressed by Hawkeye.
  2.8.5. Mission Debrief. All items in Attachment 6 must be covered during mission debriefs.
  After completing changeover with an incoming crew, the outgoing crew will accomplish a
  mission debrief.
  2.8.6. Combat Ingress/Egress Checks. Crewmembers will complete combat ingress and
  egress checks in Attachment 7 on operational missions at or prior to the entry point, and at or
  after the exit point. Training missions will include ingress/egress checks as appropriate to
  meet training objectives.
  2.8.7. CSAR and OSC Checklist. All items in Attachment 8 must be briefed when required
  to assist with CSAR efforts or act as OSC for a CSAR event.
AFI11-2RQ-4V3 16 APRIL 2013                                                                    13


                                           Chapter 3

                         NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

3.1. General.
   3.1.1. The MCE and LRE will each be manned with a qualified pilot for takeoff, departure,
   approach and landing.
   3.1.2. Both the MCE and LRE will have an active C2 link for terminal area flight operations.
   3.1.3. Where applicable certifications (e.g. FAA COA) and/or airspace regulations allow, the
   OG/CC may approve takeoff, departure, approach and landing, utilizing a single ground
   station.
   3.1.4. Taxi operations may be accomplished via a single ground station manned with a
   qualified pilot.
3.2. Ground Station.
   3.2.1. Seating. The PIC determines crewmember seating, and is the final authority on the
   number of people allowed in the MCE or LRE. Normally, the maximum number of persons
   inside the shelter is the minimum required to meet mission requirements. Only qualified
   pilots or pilots under instructor supervision (e.g. a student pilot in a course of training, or
   non-current pilot) may operate the RQ-4. Only qualified SOs or SOs under instructor
   supervision (e.g. a student SO in a course of training, or non-current SO) may perform SO
   duties.
   3.2.2. Entry. The pilot is the final authority for non-mission essential personnel (including
   visitors) in the MCE or LRE. Entry to the MCE or LRE shall be minimized and is at the sole
   discretion of the PIC while the air vehicle is in a critical phase of flight.
   3.2.3. Crewmember Utilization. Unit commanders are responsible for providing an
   atmosphere that enables crewmembers participating in an active mission to focus on the
   mission and flight responsibilities. During an active mission, participating crewmembers
   will not be called out of the MCE or LRE to manage non-mission ground matters, and will
   not be tasked with other ground duties.
   3.2.4. Crewmember Materials.
      3.2.4.1. Do not place items (e.g. checklists or charts) on any keyboard or mouse at any
      time during ground or flight operations.
      3.2.4.2. The pilot will ensure all crewmember-controlled classified material is removed
      from the ground station upon mission completion.
      3.2.4.3. Crewmembers will operate in the ground station with only those electronic items
      necessary for flight and/or mission operations.
   3.2.5. Ground Station Shadow Operations. The PIC must approve all ground station
   shadow operations. Prior to flight, one ground station will be designated as primary. Other
   ground stations may shadow mission operations but are prohibited from sending air vehicle
   commands or setting an “In Ctrl C” on one of their active links without prior coordination
 14                                                           AFI11-2RQ-4V3 16 APRIL 2013


   and approval of the PIC. Squadron Operations Supervisor will be notified by the PIC prior to
   commencing shadow operations.
3.3. Required Equipment. Flight operations require the following equipment:
   3.3.1. Two communications links are required for flight operations. Where applicable
   certifications (e.g. FAA COA) and/or airspace regulations allow, the OG/CC may approve
   single link operations for Higher Headquarters (HHQ) directed missions and trans-oceanic
   transit. If INMARSAT is the only communications link available, the pilot should keep the
   air vehicle on a mission-planned track or designated orbit.
       3.3.1.1. The OG/CC is the approval authority for approach and landing with a single C2
       link.
   3.3.2. Flights may be conducted without an Enhanced Integrated Sensor Suite (EISS),
   provided appropriate ballast and/or heat loads are installed.
3.4. Communications. All intercom and voice-over IP (VOIP) communications should utilize
the following call signs: “LRE,” “MCE,” “GHOC,” “SO,” “GHOC SO,” and “LNO.”
Instructors and evaluators should amend their designated call signs with instructor or evaluator
as applicable.
   3.4.1. Telephone Communications.
       3.4.1.1. Operating units will establish procedures to ensure telephone calls are routed
       through the GHOC to the maximum extent possible. Telephone calls made directly to the
       MCE and LRE should be limited to time-critical mission and flight-related issues. MCE
       and LRE phone numbers will only be distributed to individuals, organizations or agencies
       with a specific need to speak directly to the MCE or LRE pilot (e.g. AOC LNO or Air
       Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC)).
       3.4.1.2. When the air vehicle is airborne in a controlled airspace, the telephone is
       approved as a backup means for two-way communications with ATC, and a landline
       must be solely dedicated for ATC use. Telephone communication with ATC takes
       precedence over all other telephone use.
       3.4.1.3. The pilot actively operating the air vehicle should not use the telephone during a
       critical phase of flight unless absolutely necessary for safe operation (e.g. ATC
       communications).
   3.4.2. Ground Communications. The PIC, Hawkeye and ground crew will ensure two-way
   communications during all ground checks and at all times when the air vehicle engine is
   operating on the ground. Two-way communication with the ground crew will be maintained
   until the ground crew is released by the PIC.
   3.4.3. In-flight Communications.
       3.4.3.1. Limit intercom communications to flight-critical information from initiation of
       the “Starting Engine and Before Taxi” checklist through completion of the “After
       Takeoff/Climb” checklist, and from initiation of the “Before Landing” checklist through
       completion of the “Aircraft Shutdown” checklist. During critical phases of flight,
       maintain a sterile environment consistent with good crew resource management (CRM)
       principles.
AFI11-2RQ-4V3 16 APRIL 2013                                                                   15


       3.4.3.2. Pilots will monitor inter-shelter communications, advise the PIC prior to going
       off headset, and announce when back on.
       3.4.3.3. Time permitting, the pilot actively operating the air vehicle will verbalize any
       commands which affect guidance or steering modes, heading, altitude or flight controls to
       allow the pilot in the other shelter(s) to crosscheck and monitor air vehicle control.
3.5. Flight Manuals and Checklists. Crewmembers are responsible for ensuring a current copy
of the Electronic Flight Manual (EFM), is available in the MCE and LRE. Each crewmember
will have and refer to appropriate checklists during flight operations.
3.6. Runway Requirements. Waiver authority for this paragraph is the OG/CC. Runway
dimensions must meet the following minimums:
   3.6.1. Minimum runway length is 8000 feet.
   3.6.2. Minimum runway width is 148 feet.
   3.6.3. Minimum taxiway width is 75 feet.
   3.6.4. Intersection Departures. Intersection departures are authorized if coordinated with
   appropriate agencies and incorporated into the mission plan.
3.7. Engine Start. Engine start will be accomplished by the VTC only after the air vehicle is
validated as acceptable for flight and approved by the PIC. Hawkeye may approve engine start if
pre-coordinated with the PIC, after completion of exterior inspection checklist and verification
that aircraft forms are properly signed off. The PIC assumes responsibility for the air vehicle
once the engine is started and the PIC has one good C2 link.
3.8. Taxi.
   3.8.1. A line-of-sight (LOS) link should be used for taxi.
   3.8.2. If known LOS limitations exist at an airfield:
       3.8.2.1. More than one “In Control” link may be designated for taxi.
       3.8.2.2. PICs may elect to utilize a beyond line-of-sight (BLOS) link.
3.9. Takeoff. For single shelter operations, only the primary link will be selected as being “In
Control.” For dual shelter operations, a primary link for each ground station must be selected as
“In Control.”
3.10. Cruise.
   3.10.1. The MCE pilot will advise the LRE pilot of significant changes in return time within
   three hours of landing (if possible), or whenever additional assistance is required.
   3.10.2. Extension of on-station time will be coordinated through the tasking authority and
   the PIC. The PIC will ensure the Squadron Operations Supervisor is notified of large
   deviations from planned mission tasking, to include extension of flight time by over one
   hour, deviation from flight planned route by over 200 miles and landings more than 2.5 hours
   early.
   3.10.3. When operating in Override Mode, pilots will ensure the contingency logic waypoint
   is appropriate for the geographic location of the air vehicle and will reset the logic as
   required to update wind information.

3.11. Approach and Landing.
   3.11.1. Approaches to landing will be monitored by radar, when available and a ground
   safety observer or Hawkeye (EXCEPTION: landings at alternate/emergency airfields do not
   require the ground safety observer).
   3.11.2. Fuel Requirements.
      3.11.2.1. Normal Recovery Fuel. Pilots will plan for landing with a minimum of 1,200
      pounds of fuel.
      3.11.2.2. Minimum Fuel. Declare minimum fuel as soon as it becomes apparent the air
      vehicle will land with less than 1,000 pounds of fuel.
      3.11.2.3. Emergency Fuel. Declare emergency fuel as soon as it becomes apparent the
      air vehicle will land with 800 pounds of fuel or less.

                    INSTRUMENT AND WEATHER PROCEDURES

4.1. Approaches. The RQ-4 flies self-contained GPS-aided inertial navigation system (INS)
pre-programmed approaches. Standard civilian or military IAPs will not be attempted.
4.2. Weather Minima, Restrictions and Planning Factors. See MAJCOM Supplement to
AFI 11-202V3 for additional RQ-4 weather requirements.
   4.2.1. Ceiling and Visibility.
      4.2.1.1. For RQ-4 operations at any airfield, the weather (temporary or prevailing) must
      be at or above a ceiling of at least 1000 feet and a visibility of 2 miles. The weather for
      RQ-4 operations must be at or above these minima at takeoff and be forecast to be at or
      above these minima until takeoff plus 1 hour and again at the estimated time of arrival
      (ETA) +/-2 hours. If the weather remains below landing minimums (1000/2), the pilot
      will recover the aircraft to the designated alternate landing surface unless landing below
      weather minimums is approved by the OG/CC. The OG/CC may approve landing below
      weather minimums down to and including zero feet ceiling and zero visibility conditions.
      Units will publish local guidance covering procedures and airfield agency notifications
      for landings made when the airfield is below its lowest approach minimums.
      4.2.1.2. RQ-4 may takeoff in weather conditions below the minimums in paragraph
      4.2.1.1; however, the mission must be HHQ directed and approved by the OG/CC.
      Visibility must be at least 1600 feet (500 m) runway visual range. When the departure
      airfield weather is below RQ-4 landing minima in paragraph 4.2.1.1, pilots will either
      declare a takeoff alternate or obtain OG/CC approval to land below RQ-4 minima at the
      takeoff airfield. A suitable takeoff alternate airfield is one within 1 hour flight time at
      cruising speed, has at least a ceiling of 1000 feet and visibility of 2 miles, and is approved
      as an alternate airfield with a pre-planned RQ-4 approach in the mission plan.
      4.2.1.3. RQ-4 operations are authorized holding in lieu of designating an alternate.
      Pilots will ensure the air vehicle has sufficient fuel on board to hold for 2 hours at the
      destination then penetrate and land with normal recovery fuel.
   4.2.2. Wind. The RQ-4’s long endurance and logistical challenges involved with landing at
   an alternate airfield present a problem when forecast winds exceed limits for part of a
   planned mission. Pilots will comply with the following regarding forecast winds:
      4.2.2.1. Forecast winds must be within flight manual limits for takeoff time plus one
      hour and at ETA +/-2 hours at the primary airfield or designated alternate.
      4.2.2.2. While airborne, if revised forecast winds for ETA +/-2 hours exceed limits
      specified in the RQ-4 flight manual, the pilot will conclude the mission in time to return
      the air vehicle to the operating base before the forecast time of increased winds or,
      conclude the mission in time to return the air vehicle to the operating base with sufficient
      fuel to hold (if required) for a minimum of two hours.
4.3. Thunderstorms.
 18                                                          AFI11-2RQ-4V3 16 APRIL 2013


   4.3.1. Takeoffs, approaches or landings are prohibited when thunderstorms or lightning are
   reported within 20 NM of the airfield. For HHQ-directed operational missions, the OG/CC
   may authorize takeoffs, landings and approaches if thunderstorms are observed to be within
   20 NM of the airfield, but no closer than 10 NM from the arrival/departure routing.
   Thunderstorms must not be producing hazardous conditions at either the airfield or in the
   departure/approach corridors being used. Thunderstorms must not be forecast or observed to
   be moving in any direction that threatens either the airfield or the departure/approach
   corridors.
   4.3.2. Avoid thunderstorm activity along a flight planned route, using any means available,
   by 20 NM laterally at all flight planned route altitudes below FL 500. When at or above FL
   500, over flight of thunderstorms is permissible provided at least 10,000 foot vertical
   clearance can be maintained.
4.4. Cold-Weather Operating Procedures.
   4.4.1. Rain, Snow, Freezing Precipitation and Frost. Precipitation is any form of water
   particle that falls from the atmosphere. Precipitation can be liquid, freezing (liquid that
   instantly freezes on contact with a surface) or solid form. Examples include rain, freezing
   rain, and snow. Frost is a layer of ice crystals that may form on aircraft surfaces when
   ambient temperatures reach below 40 degrees Fahrenheit (F). Freezing rain, snow, and frost
   can accumulate on aircraft surfaces and severely disrupt flight characteristics including a
   complete loss of lift.
      4.4.1.1. Do not take off with any frost, ice or snow accumulation on any air vehicle
      surface. Whenever the outside air temperature is less than 40 degrees F with visible
      moisture, inspect the air vehicle for frost or ice immediately prior to takeoff.
   4.4.2. Runway and Taxiway Conditions.
      4.4.2.1. Runway and taxiway surfaces may be wet, but operations are not allowed on
      runways or taxiways with standing water present.
4.5. Weather Recall.
   4.5.1. Geographically Separated MCE and LRE. The PIC is responsible for initiating
   weather recall. Should the weather forecast change during the mission such that an out-of-
   limits condition is expected at the time of planned landing, the PIC will coordinate a mission
   change. MCE pilots should update their weather forecast for landing periodically to monitor
   for out-of-limits conditions and contact the LRE pilot to determine the appropriate course-of-
   action. The Squadron Operations Supervisor will be notified before the mission is recalled.
   4.5.2. MCE and LRE Co-located at the Same Airfield. The Supervisor of Flying (SOF)
   or Squadron Operations Supervisor is responsible for initiating weather recall. Should the
   weather forecast change during the mission such that an out-of-limits condition is expected at
   the time of planned landing, the SOF or Squadron Operations Supervisor will notify the
   applicable personnel to coordinate a mission change. The Squadron Operations Supervisor
   will notify the LRE pilot of the new ETA.

                         ABNORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

5.1. General.
   5.1.1. The OG/CC is the waiver authority for all aspects of this Chapter.
   5.1.2. MCE-only landings for diverts will be made only to approved alternate airfields.
   MCE-only takeoffs for the purpose of returning the air vehicle to its normal operating airfield
   will be approved by the OG/CC and will be coordinated through the appropriate servicing
   ATC facilities.
5.2. Ground Emergencies. All ground emergencies should result in a stop taxi or aborted
takeoff. The pilot should initiate a stop taxi or abort takeoff even if the air vehicle is supposed to
automatically respond.
5.3. In-flight Emergencies (IFE).
   5.3.1. Emergency Landing. When time and conditions permit, notify the Squadron
   Operations Supervisor of any emergency landing at an alternate or emergency airfield. If a
   landing at an emergency airfield cannot be completed without endangering personnel or
   property on the ground, then the air vehicle will be flown to an approved termination point
   for flight termination. The OG/CC and SQ/CC/DO will be notified when an air vehicle is
   directed to a termination point for flight termination. If the air vehicle cannot reach an
   approved termination point, the pilot will direct the air vehicle to an unpopulated area and
   initiate flight termination or allow it to crash on course.
   5.3.2. Landing with Degraded Navigation Solution. Landing may be made with a final
   navigation quality less than 18 provided the navigation accuracy is sufficient for the runway
   width.
   5.3.3. Loss of C2 (“lost link”). In the event of lost link, the PIC shall make every effort to
   regain link while communicating with ATC or military C2 assets to coordinate emergency
   handling and the air vehicles predicted flight path.
   5.3.4. Crew Changeover. Due to the RQ-4’s endurance, it may become necessary for a
   crew to changeover with an ongoing malfunction or IFE. The incoming pilot must be
   provided a complete understanding of the malfunction(s) and air vehicle status prior to any
   crew changeover. The outgoing pilot may be required to remain and assist with an ongoing
   emergency at the discretion of the PIC.
5.4. Simulated Emergencies. Practice of simulated emergencies may only be accomplished in
an approved aircrew training device.

AFI11-2RQ-4V3 16 APRIL 2013                                                                21


                                         Chapter 7

                               SECURITY PROCEDURES

7.1. General. This chapter provides guidance on security for the RQ-4 Global Hawk Unmanned
Aerial System (UAS). AFI 31-101, Air Force Installation Security Program, and specific
MAJCOM security publications contain additional guidance.
7.2. System Security.
   7.2.1. The RQ-4 UAS is operationally fielded as a multi-segmented weapons system
   consisting of air and ground-based segments necessary to its operation. The air vehicle and
   sensor payloads make up the air-based segment, while the ground-based segments include
   the MCE, LRE, data links, and support equipment.
   7.2.2. The Protection Level (PL) of airborne or ground-based segments is determined by the
   specific segment’s location (CONUS or OCONUS) and not any specific mission the system
   happens to be performing at any given time. The warfighter or local commander may
   employ additional security measures based upon assessment of the current threat. Basic
   protection of the RQ-4 UAS is enhanced through owner/user security awareness, security
   technology and force protection (FP) initiatives.
   7.2.3. RQ-4 airborne or ground-based segments are PL2 when OCONUS, excluding Hawaii,
   Alaska and Guam.
   7.2.4. RQ-4 airborne or ground-based segments are PL3 when in CONUS, Hawaii, Alaska
   and Guam.
   7.2.5. RQ-4 airborne or ground-based segments will be protected IAW PL4 standards when
   non-operational (depot maintenance, training or test).
7.3. Ground Segment (MCE/LRE) Security Requirements.
   7.3.1. Security requirements for ground segments must be distinguished from those applied
   to air vehicles. The ground segments of the RQ-4 UAS perform command, control, and
   communications (C3) functions in support of flight operations and receive protection
   according to C3 facility standards specified per AFI 31-101 and the appropriate MAJCOM
   supplement. During increased tensions and higher FPCONs local planners at home station
   and deployed locations implement security measures to ensure personnel safeguard ground
   segments at a level commensurate with the threat to the resources and their relative
   importance to the mission.
   7.3.2. Entry/Access and Internal Security for Ground Segments. At home station and
   deployed locations the owner/user controls entry and monitors internal security for the
   MCE/LRE during 24/7 operations. NOTE: The home station defense force commander
   ensures owner/user personnel are trained and exercised in the performance of entry control
   and internal security functions for both normal and emergency operations. Install the
   appropriate level of automated entry control system or cipher locks to facilitate entry of
   authorized personnel into the MCE/LRE.
   7.3.3. Intrusion Detection Systems and Physical Security Requirements for Ground
   Segments.
 22                                                          AFI11-2RQ-4V3 16 APRIL 2013


      7.3.3.1. Install a duress capability in the MCE/LRE which terminates at the base defense
      operations center.
      7.3.3.2. At deployed locations, make every effort to locate the MCE/LRE and other
      ground segments in a fenced area with sufficient lighting to observe intruders in the
      immediate area around these resources.
      7.3.3.3. At home station and permanent operating locations, perimeter fencing, boundary
      lighting, and intrusion detection systems are not required for the MCE or LRE. Clear
      zone requirements are not applicable for areas containing the MCE/LRE.
7.4. Mission Support Equipment.
   7.4.1. Mission support equipment includes ground based communications (e.g., satellite
   antennas) and support equipment (e.g., power supply). Support equipment such as power
   supply or climate control equipment is not assigned a PL. Ground-based communications
   equipment deployed in CONUS-based or OCONUS-based “reach back” mode are C2/C4
   resources and will be protected as follows:
      7.4.1.1. Designate the immediate area surrounding “reach back” communications
      equipment a restricted area and provide fencing and adequate lighting at permanent
      locations. Intrusion detection systems are not required; a duress capability and use of
      available surveillance and assessment technology tied to a 24/7 security control center is
      recommended. Clear zone requirements are not applicable for areas containing these
      resources.
      7.4.1.2. At home station and deployed locations, owners/users control entry to the area
      and monitor internal security when present. Security Forces (SF) provides a five-minute
      response capability by police services, installation patrols, or available Security Response
      Teams. SF conducts periodic checks when the area is not manned by owner users.
      7.4.1.3. At OCONUS locations without a US security force presence the owner/user
      coordinates with the host for security support commensurate with support required per
      paragraphs 7.4.1.1 and 7.4.1.2.
7.5. Data-Centric Proactive Safety Programs.
   7.5.1. Proactive safety uses correlated data streams for hazard identification and risk
   mitigation to prevent mishaps and accomplish the mission. Proactive safety programs enable
   leaders, safety professionals, and aircrews to achieve efficiencies in maintenance, operations,
   safety, tactics, and training. These programs include: Military Flight Operations Quality
   Assurance (MFOQA), Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP), and Line Operations Safety
   Audit (LOSA).

Terms
Critical Phase of Flight— Critical phases of flight for the RQ-4 are taxi, takeoff, departure
(below 18,000 feet MSL), arrival, approach, landing, taxi and engine shutdown.
Phase Manual— Phase manuals are “how to” documents that expand on basic procedures in
flight manuals and applicable AFIs, and provide student crewmembers with explanatory study
material. Phase manuals provide complementary and/or more detailed descriptions as compared
to information presented in flight manuals and AFIs.
Global Hawk Operations Center (GHOC)— The GHOC is a squadron-level mission center
manned by BMC and CMR crewmembers and intelligence personnel. The GHOC provides
command, control, communications, computer, and intelligence support to the pilots and SOs
actively executing a mission to ensure the commander’s intent is accomplished, and the
designated mission is effectively prosecuted. GHOC functions include coordinating collection
plans, coordinating taskings, serving as a communications filter between the ground station
crewmembers and outside agencies, and de-conflicting airspace with other high-altitude aircraft.
Hawkeye— the safety observer to provide eyes for the pilot in the ground station when the air
vehicle is taxiing, taking off or landing.
Squadron Operations Supervisor— Squadron Commander, Operations Officer, Assistant
Operations Officers, and Flight CCs.
Stitched Route— RQ-4 mission planned route of flight that can be selected autonomously by
the aircraft logic during contingency operations. This includes lost communications (C1), return
to base (C2), major emergency (C3) or abort land (C4) routes.
Termination Point—Termination points are designated ground impact points for the RQ-4
when it is determined the air vehicle is uncontrollable for landing or a landing at a suitable
airfield cannot be made safely without undue risk to personnel and property on the ground.
Vehicle Test Controller (VTC)— The VTC is support equipment used by maintenance
technicians to facilitate trouble-shooting and maintenance of systems on the air vehicle. When
connected to the air vehicle, the VTC provides an operator-to-system interface, and is the system
controller for pre-launch, post recovery and ground maintenance test operations. The VTC
provides access to mission status and health of air vehicle components. The VTC operator is
provided with options for controlling system configuration, test environment, mission definition
and data log management. In addition, the VTC supports uploading/downloading maintenance
and mission data, provides the capability to command built-in test functions for scheduled and
unscheduled maintenance, and displays the air vehicle fault logs.

                       ALTERNATE AIRFIELD DECISION MATRIX

A2.1. Alternate Airfield Decision Matrix. The decision matrix in Table A2.1 will be used to
determine the suitability of each airfield considered for use as an alternate or emergency airfield.
A2.2. Decision Matrix Use.
   A2.2.1. Airfield options are likely to have a mixture of factors. For example, a runway may
   be considered “suitable” from a length, width, and type, but “marginal” from an airspace and
   population density perspective. The suitability of each airfield will be evaluated on a case-
   by-case basis taking into account how factors rated “marginal” or “unsuitable” influence
   overall rating and suitability.
   A2.2.2. Units may develop suitability grading criteria similar to an Operational Risk
   Management (ORM) worksheet where points are assigned to each of the boxes in the matrix
   and an overall grade is based on the cumulative point score.

                               CSAR AND OSC CHECKLISTS

A8.1. General. Checklists are provided for use in the event of a SAR or CSAR event. The
checklists should not be considered all-inclusive, and items should be applied as necessary
dependent on the situation or event. Flexibility is paramount, and every SAR or CSAR event
should be treated as time-critical; successful recovery of downed aircrew or survivors becomes
less likely as the time for rescue forces to reach them increases. The GHOC or MCE crew
should establish communications with the appropriate AOC CSAR cell or Rescue Coordination
Center (RCC), and the SAR Mission Coordinator. The most difficult and time-consuming event
phase is obtaining Positive Identification and Location of survivors, and communicating that
information to the recovery launch authority.
   A8.1.1. Aviate:
       A8.1.1.1. Establish safe course or loiter pattern.
          A8.1.1.1.1. Altitude.
          A8.1.1.1.2. Airspeed.
          A8.1.1.1.3. Heading.
       A8.1.1.2. . Avoid threats.
   A8.1.2. Stack:
       A8.1.2.1. Direct all aircraft to an altitude above the last known parachute altitude.
       A8.1.2.2. De-conflict assisting aircraft by altitude, non-essential aircraft return to base.
   A8.1.3. Squawk (peace time):
       A8.1.3.1. If on-scene when a survivor situation develops, set IFF to emergency 7700
       alerting ATC or controlling agency of distress situation.
       A8.1.3.2. Have the GHOC call C2 agencies (AOC, RCC, etc.).
   A8.1.4. Communicate:
       A8.1.4.1. Monitor Guard for initial contact with survivor.
       A8.1.4.2. . Establish radio contact with controlling agencies.
       A8.1.4.3. When contact is established with survivor – push 282.8 if able.
       A8.1.4.4. Relay critical information as required and brief assisting aircraft as necessary.
   A8.1.5. Mark and Identify:
       A8.1.5.1. Location of survivor and/or crash site with geographic references, coordinates,
       radial/distance measuring equipment (DME), or a search and rescue point (SARDOT).
       A8.1.5.2. Hostile environment and enemy activity:
          A8.1.5.2.1. Unfriendly persons and enemy activity.
          A8.1.5.2.2. Terrain considerations for recovery.

         A8.1.5.2.3. Weather considerations.
         A8.1.5.2.4. Necessary standoff to avoid highlighting survivor position.
     A8.1.5.3. Authenticate (may be difficult due to communication limitations):
         A8.1.5.3.1. Check SPINS.
         A8.1.5.3.2. ISOPREP.
  A8.1.6. Assess Aircraft:
     A8.1.6.1. Establish bingo fuel.
     A8.1.6.2. Sensor status.
  A8.1.7. Direct (if able direct elements participating to affect recovery):
     A8.1.7.1. . Rescue escort and/or recovery vehicles to survivor.
     A8.1.7.2. Survivor to:
         A8.1.7.2.1. Signal.
         A8.1.7.2.2. Move to better position.
  A8.1.8. Handoff:
     A8.1.8.1. Brief Airborne Mission Commander, new OSC or “SANDY” if being relieved.
     A8.1.8.2. Provide imagery of survivor area to AOC if able.
