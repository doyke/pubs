This pamphlet series is intended as a load planning guide and provides the basic information,
data, and technical specifications needed in order for planners (both long range and individual
movement) to load plan aircraft in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF). Equipment and methods
listed are compatible with all CRAF aircraft and cargo areas discussed. It must be noted that,
unlike military cargo aircraft, civilian airframes are not standardized, and can vary widely,
even within each carrier’s fleet. Final approval, therefore, ultimately rests with the
individual contractor providing airlift services to the DOD. This pamphlet series enables
application of DTR 4500.9-R, Defense Transportation Regulation – Part III Mobility, Appendix
V, Aircraft Load Planning and Documentation; as well as AMCI 10-402, Civil Reserve Air Fleet
(CRAF). The guidance contained herein is applicable to all USAF, AFRC, ANG and DOD
agencies whenever they are charged with using the CRAF assets contained herein, in accordance
with DOD, inter-service, and/or MAJCOM agreements.

                                       Chapter 1
                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Purpose. This pamphlet series is non-directive in nature. It provides the basic information,
data, and technical specifications needed in order for planners to more efficiently and effectively
load plan aircraft in the CRAF.

1.2. Scope. CRAF aircraft specifications listed herein are current as of the date of this printing.
Equipment and methods listed are compatible with all CRAF aircraft and cargo areas discussed.
It must be noted that, unlike military cargo aircraft, civilian airframes are not
standardized, and can vary widely, even within each carrier’s fleet. Final approval,
therefore, ultimately rests with the individual contractor providing airlift services to the
DOD.
1.2.1. Volume 3, Boeing. AMCPAM 24-2 Volume 3 deals specifically with aircraft
manufactured by the Boeing Company. Boeing was first formed in 1916 as Pacific               Aero
Products Co, changing its name about a year later to the Boeing Airplane Co. Through several
mergers over the years (the last being with McDonnell Douglas Corp in 1997), the Boeing
Company has melded the companies founded by aerospace pioneers William Boeing, Donald
Douglas, James McDonnell, James "Dutch" Kindelberger, and Howard Hughes Jr. As of the date
of this publication, the Boeing Company has produced almost 17,000 commercial jet aircraft
alone, with over 12,100 still in service.

1.3. Arrangement. This pamphlet series is designed for easy reference and access to the most
commonly needed information for planning purposes. Essentially, Volume 1 will contain all
information common to the entire CRAF program and most, if not all, carriers. Volumes 2
through 5 will contain information specific to a particular manufacturer’s airframes, with each
sub-volume addendum addressing a different series or type. Each can be referenced separately
from another; however, each addendum needs to be used in conjunction with Volume 1.
1.3.1. Volume 3, Boeing Addenda. Volume 3 is not separated from each subsequent addendum,
but is published as a “cover” document along with and as an introduction for each addendum.
The same information for Volume 3 essentially gets republished--unchanged with each Boeing
model’s addendum.
1.3.2. Volume 3, Boeing Quick Reference Tables. All chapter descriptions for various models
are designed to be used in conjunction with Chapter 2 Quick Reference Tables. The information

1.7. Description. Addendum C. Boeing B747 Series.
The B747 Series aircraft are wide-body, four engine aircraft, designed to fly long range and to
ease congestion at airports with its high passenger/cargo capacity. At the time of development in
the early 1960's, it was decided to design the B747 so that it could easily be either a passenger or
a cargo aircraft. This forethought enabled many models to be sold as either, or to be converted
later on into freighters. To date, more than 1,400 B747 models have been delivered, with roughly
400 of the -100, -200, and -300's and approximately 650 of the B747-400's are still in service.

The B747-100 was the first aircraft in the series and was developed in 1966. It first flew in
February of 1969, and was type-certified in December 1969. Boeing was able to take advantage
of maximizing its structural capability as well using greater thrust with new high-bypass turbofan
engines. This allowed for increased payload/range ability. Variations included the B747-100B
(type-certified August 1979) featuring a higher payload and the B747-100SF (Special Freighter)
which has virtually the same cargo space as the B747-200F. The most well known model is a
modified B747-100, used by NASA to ferry the space shuttle. Overall, 250 B747-100’s were
manufactured and delivered until the production line was shut down in 1986.

The B747-200 (also known as the B747-200B) first flew in October 1970 and was type-certified
in December of the same year. Identical to the B747-100 on the exterior, increased body
structure, fuel capacity, and improved engines allowed the -200's to carry more payload. Perhaps
the most famous B747 are B747-200B's that have served as Air Force One since 1990. Overall,
393 B747-200's of various types have been delivered until production ceased in 1991.

The B747-200F ("F" for Freighter) had its first flight in November 1971, and was type-certified
in March 1972. The B747-200F has an upward opening main-deck nose door as well as a
mechanized cargo-handling system. The main compartment floor strength has been increased as
well as passenger windows being eliminated. Some models are also equipped with an optional
main-deck side cargo door.

The B747-200C ("C" for Convertible) had its first flight in March 1973, and was type-certified
in April of that year. The B747-200C is virtually identical to the B747-200F except that it has a
redesigned interior permitting all passenger, all cargo, or mixed passenger/cargo configurations.

The B747-200 Combi (also known as the B747-200M) had its first flight in November 1974,
and was type-certified in March 1975. The B747-200 Combi is similar to the B747-200C, but
does not have a main-deck nose door.

The B747-300 and B747-300 Combi (also known as the B747-300M) had its first flight in
October 1982 and February 1983, respectively, and both were type-certified in March 1983. The
B747-300 and B747-300 Combi is basically a 747-200 series airplane with a stretched upper
deck and improved engines. Eighty one were manufactured prior to production ceasing in 1990.

The B747-400 first flew in April 1988 and was type-certified in January 1989. Identical to the
-300's on the interior, the -400 models featured several modifications including: winglets,
advanced high bypass ratio engines, lightweight aluminum alloys, enhanced cabin interiors, and
a fly-by-wire system. The -400 was designed as a passenger version with over 440 models built.
The B747-400 Combi (also known as the B747-400M) first flew in June 1989, but shared type-
certification with the B747-400 as January 1989. The -400 Combi airplane has a main deck cargo
door installed on the left side aft of the wing. The main deck of the Combi airplane can be
converted to either an all-passenger or a passenger/cargo configuration. Sixty one B747-400
Combi's were made, with the last delivered in April 2002.

The B747-400F ("F" for Freighter) first flew in May 1993 and was type-certified in October of
that year. The 747-400F is basically the 747-400 series airplane with strengthened wings and the
747-200F fuselage. Hence, the -400F has a main-deck nose door as well as mechanized cargo-
handling system, and an optional side cargo door. Originally, 126 B747-400F's were built, but
with the introduction of the 747-400 Boeing Converted Freighter (BCF) program, it is unknown
how many -400 passenger or combi airplanes will be converted to freighters.

Extended range versions of the B747-400 and B747-400F have been built. These have been
designated as the B747-400ER and the B747-400ERF. Both first flew and were type-certified
in 2002, and are essentially increased gross weight derivatives of the -400/-400F. The increased
weight allows the -400ER to carry additional fuel to fly over longer ranges and the -400ERF to
carry more cargo weight. To date, six -400ER's have been made and 40 B747-400ERF's built.

The B747-8F is the latest in the series. The B747-8F will incorporate much of the cockpit and
engine designs of the B787, has a stretched fuselage from the B747-400F and promises 16
percent more revenue cargo volume than the 747-400F. The B747-8F had its first flight on
February 8, 2010 and has over 100 orders pending, thus preliminary data will be shown herein.

2.1. Ranges. Most numbers are shown as a range, due to representing all-passenger to all-freight
versions OR due to different modifications within a series/type. Also, within a series, several
different engines/weight classes may exist.

2.2. Pallets. Unless otherwise noted, pallet information is based on the civilian pallet IATA code
PAG- / P1P- type LD7 which measures 88" × 125".

2.3. Table Legends.
2.3.1. Compartments. Unless otherwise noted, compartments are: M=Main/Upper;
F=Forward/Lower Lobe; A=Aft/Lower Lobe; B=Bulk/Lower Lobe.

2.3.2. “X”. An “X” represents the information does NOT apply for that series/type (ex: an all-
passenger version would have an “X” by Main Compartment Door)

2.3.3. Question Mark “?”. A “?” represents that the information should apply, but no
information exists in the manufacturer’s technical manuals.

2.3.4. Exclamation Point “!”. An “!” represents information that should apply, but has been
derived from a reliable, but non-manufacturer source.

2.4. After-Market Conversions. As a reminder, individual airlines may have converted an
airframe apart from the manufacturer’s original specifications. These tables and the charts in the
following chapters do not account for this.

2.5. Tables. The following tables (Tables 2.1 through 2.6) will vary with each AMCPAM 24-2,
