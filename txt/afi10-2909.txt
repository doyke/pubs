                               AIR AND OXYGEN EQUIPMENT

2.1. Bag-Valve-Mask Resuscitator (Adult/Child/Infant)
     2.1.1. Purpose. The Bag-Valve-Mask (BVM) Resuscitators are used to administer artificial
     ventilation when natural inspirations are insufficient or absent. NOTE: BVM Resuscitator
     brands may be disposable or reusable depending on the manufacturer selected for AE In-
     Flight Kit, Packaging Guide/Allowance Standard. The following guidelines are general in
     description. Variances based on current brand will be identified prior to use.
     2.1.2. Parts. The BVM kit consists of a bag valve-mask assembly, and an oxygen reservoir
     bag (or corrugated tubing). There are three (3) sizes:
        2.1.2.1. Adult – The Adult unit consists of cuffed masks, a non-re-breathing patient
        valve, a ventilation bag, an intake/reservoir valve, and an oxygen reservoir bag (or
        corrugated tubing).
        2.1.2.2. Child –The Child unit is similar to the Adult unit, but has smaller cuffed masks,
        a non-re-breathing patient valve with a pressure limiting device, a ventilation bag, an
        intake/reservoir valve and an oxygen reservoir bag (or corrugated tubing).
        2.1.2.3. Infant – The Infant unit is similar to the Child unit, but has a one piece mask, a
        non-re-breathing patient valve with pressure limiting device, a ventilation bag, an
        intake/reservoir valve and an oxygen reservoir bag (or corrugated tubing).
     2.1.3. Pre-flight. Ensure all components are present and in serviceable condition.
        2.1.3.1. Ensure the bag is intact, and does not contain any rips, or holes.
        2.1.3.2. Ensure the location of airway adjuncts is known.
     2.1.4. Performance. Select the resuscitator based on patient size (Adult, Child, or Infant).
     Connect oxygen tubing from the BVM to flow meter or oxygen flow regulator outlet and set
     the rate to “Flush” to achieve maximum oxygen percentage available based on BVM type.
     Connect the appropriate sized mask to the manual resuscitator. Place an airway adjunct if
     necessary to maintain a patent airway. Seal the mask over the patient’s nose and mouth.
     Maintaining a seal, compress the ventilation bag to ventilate the patient. Observe for chest
     rise and fall. WARNINGS: If applicable, ensure proper size reservoir bag is used with each
     ventilation bag. Ensure non-re-breathing valve, with pressure limiting device, is in place on
     child and infant units. If needed, the pressure-limiting device can be overridden. Ensure a
     BVM with a Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) accompanies intubated patients on
     ventilators when PEEP is > 5 mmHg. PEEP valve is available on the Allowance Standard.
     NOTES: The pressure-limiting device restricts airway pressure to 35 centimeters H20
     pressure. The oxygen reservoir bag must inflate with oxygen to be effective. If it does not,
     ensure oxygen is being delivered to the unit at an adequate rate. For patients who require
     airborne infection control precautions, place ventilator breathing circuit filter aft of mask and
     forward of elbow fitting. If expired body fluids block the filter; replace filter and continue
     cardiopulmonary resuscitation effort. If endotracheal tube (ET) is used, place filter aft of ET
     and forward of BVM elbow fitting.

   2.1.5. Cleaning. Refer to manufacturer’s guidelines for reusable BVM resuscitator cleaning
   specifics.
2.2. Minilator.
   2.2.1. Purpose. The Minilator is an oxygen distribution system designed to provide
   therapeutic oxygen for up to five (5) patients from a single oxygen hose from a given source.
   WARNING: The Minilator was not designed for and will not be used to support ventilatory
   devices. Connect a separate oxygen hose from an approved oxygen source to operate
   ventilators. NOTE: The oxygen flow control valve, from the PTLOX/NPTLOX system
   accessory kit, will not be used with the Minilator. Utilize the flow control valves or veriflow
   flow meters carried in the AE Inflight Kits.
   2.2.2. Parts. The Minilator is an oxygen distribution system with one (1) inlet, which is
   connected to the oxygen source, and five (5) outlet valves for distributing oxygen, and (1)
   connector for use with a standard oxygen hose. Check valves are installed in the outlets to
   prevent oxygen flow from any unused outlets. Dust covers are installed to prevent debris
   from entering the Minilator.
   2.2.3. Preflight. Inspect the manifold and connector for damage or obvious contamination.
   2.2.4. Performance. Connect standard low-pressure oxygen hose to the connector, and the
   connector to the Minilator inlet valve. Remove the necessary dust caps from the outlet
   valves, and connect a flow meter or a standard low-pressure oxygen hose to the outlets.
   Connect the low-pressure hoses to flow meter/humidifier assemblies and purge the system
   with low flow oxygen, and then set the flow rates to the prescribed values.
       2.2.4.1. When using the PTLOX/NPTLOX as an oxygen source, connect the
       PTLOX/NPTLOX low-pressure hose directly to the Minilator inlet valve. Remove the
       necessary dust caps from the outlet valves and connect a veriflow flow meter or a
       standard low-pressure oxygen hose to the outlets. Ensure veriflow flow meter setting is
       at zero. Then connect the PTLOX/NPTLOX low-pressure hose with Schrader end into
       the PTLOX/NPTLOX system. Purge system to clear the lines of any contaminants and
       return setting to zero. Attach humidifier assemblies as required and set the flow rates to
       the prescribed values. WARNING: Prior to connecting to an oxygen source, a flow
       meter with index set at zero must be attached to any oxygen hose connected to the
       Minilator. NOTES: When using a Minilator with the PTLOX/NPTLOX, the maximum
       oxygen flow is 60 liters per minute (LPM). Minilator outlets have a one-way valve
       allowing the connection/disconnection of a flow meter to the Minilator without
       disconnecting from the oxygen source.
       2.2.4.2. Disassembly/Storage. Ensure patients have been disconnected from oxygen
       and the lines have been turned off. Discontinue the oxygen source to the Minilator.
       Remove the hoses from the Minilator outlets and replace the dust caps. Disconnect the
       hose from the Minilator inlet or connector and remove the connector (if used) from the
       inlet. Replace the dust cap. Store the Minilator and connector, if applicable.

   2.3.4. Preflight. Ensure equipment is within calibration requirement date and that this date,
   recorded on the AF Form 4368, will not be exceeded during the planned mission. Ensure AF
   Form 4033 is complete and present.
      2.3.4.1. Inspect the system for any signs of damage.
      2.3.4.2. Inventory the parts.
   2.3.5. Performance. Insert the gasket end of the sensor into the “T” adapter. Secure in
   place with sensor retaining strap. Attach the sensor to the coiled cable. Firmly press the
   connector until it snaps into place; tighten the twist collar. Insert the opposite end of the
   coiled cable into the jack on the side panel of the monitor; tighten the twist collar. Calibrate
   the MiniOX 3000 per directions below. NOTES: If utilizing a new sensor, expose the
   sensor to ambient air for one (1) hour after removal from its package before performing
   calibration. DO NOT handle the sensor while performing calibrations. Body heat can cause
   the sensor’s thermistor to change disproportionately to the change in gas sample temperature
   at the sensing electrode. This may produce errors until thermal equilibrium is restored.
      2.3.5.1. The MiniOX 3000 Monitor must be calibrated:
          2.3.5.1.1. On the ground, prior to patient use.
          2.3.5.1.2. Following sensor disconnection/reconnection.
          2.3.5.1.3. When environmental conditions (temperature, pressure and humidity)
          change.
          2.3.5.1.4. Following change of battery.
          2.3.5.1.5. Before using the monitor at final cruising cabin altitude.
   2.3.6. To Calibrate in Room Air:
      2.3.6.1. Press I/O to turn ON the instrument. “CAL” flashes in the display. Press 21%.
      The following appears on the display: “CAL,” “LOCKED,” and “21% Cal.” Press
      UNLOCK key. The following will be displayed: “CAL,” “21% CAL,” and a 10-
      segment bar graph that “counts down” two seconds per bar for 20 seconds.
      2.3.6.2. After 20 seconds, the calibration process is complete. The device should display
      20.8% +/- 2% O2, proceeds to the monitoring mode, and displays the current oxygen
      concentration as %O2.
   2.3.7. To Calibrate at 100 O2 %:
AFI10-2909 23 JULY 2013                                                                         11


     2.3.7.1. Calibrate in room air (See 2.3.6). Then expose the sensor to 100% oxygen, via
     T-adapter with O2 at 4LPM, and allow the readings to stabilize prior to initiating the
     calibration. “CAL” flashes in the display. Press 100%. The following appears on the
     display: “CAL,” “LOCKED” and “100% Cal.” Press UNLOCK. The following
     appears on the display: “CAL,” “100% Cal,” and a 10-segment bar graph that “counts
     down” two seconds per bar for 20 seconds. After 20 seconds, the calibration process is
     complete and the device displays: 100% +0/-2% (98% to 100%), proceeds to the
     monitoring mode and displays the current oxygen concentration as % O2. NOTES: The
     MiniOX 3000 Oxygen Monitor has a five-second “time out” following keypad functions.
     If you do not press UNLOCK within five seconds, the instrument returns to the flashing
     “CAL” mode. During calibration, if “CAL ERR” flashes in the display, visual/audible
     alarms activate and then “CAL” flashes, turn OFF the instrument and repeat calibration
     procedure. When recalibrating, be sure to select the calibration value and use the
     corresponding calibration gas. If “CAL” continues to display following proper
     calibration or “CAL ERR” reoccurs, it may be necessary to replace the sensor.
  2.3.8. In-flight Calibration:
     2.3.8.1. If the MiniOX 3000 has been used on the ground or the unit is initially being
     used in-flight, recalibrate prior to use at cruising altitude. To calibrate in-flight, use the
     standard 21% and 100% calibration procedures (see 2.3.6. and 2.3.7.). WARNING: The
     sensor responds to partial pressure (not percentage) of oxygen. Changes in barometric
     pressure alter the reading, even if the percent of oxygen in the sample remains constant.
     Therefore, to eliminate error due to pressure changes, the instrument shall be calibrated at
     altitude. NOTE: When calibrating the monitor at altitude the cabin pressure must
     remain at a constant level for at least 2-3 minutes before calibration can be accomplished.
     If cabin altitude changes, recalibrate the MiniOx 3000 at the new pressure.
  2.3.9. Installing the Sensor in a Breathing Circuit.
     2.3.9.1. Install the “T” adapter into the breathing circuit upstream from the humidifier.
     Make sure that the side port of the “T” adapter is facing upward. Remove the coiled
     cable from the sensor. Firmly insert the sensor into the “T” adaptor with the sensor
     pointing downward to prevent moisture from condensing onto the sensor membrane.
     NOTE: Ensure that the sensor is placed upstream of the humidifier and the sensor is
     mounted pointing down to prevent moisture from draining onto the sensor membrane. If
     moisture is allowed onto the membrane it will result in a lower oxygen concentration
     reading and an increased response time.
  2.3.10. Alarms.
     2.3.10.1. The MiniOX 3000 Oxygen Monitor has audible and visual alarms that activate
     when oxygen concentrations exceed preset low or high alarm settings. Default settings
     are 18% and 50% respectively; however, the operator may select alarm levels between
     15% and 100%.
     2.3.10.2. Setting the Alarms.

         “locks” this value. After five seconds, the monitor will beep once and automatically
         proceed to the Monitoring Mode. NOTE: The Low Alarm CANNOT be disabled or
         set below 15%, above 99%, or higher than or equal to the High Alarm setting.
         2.3.10.2.2. To set the High Alarm: Press SET twice. The following appears on the
         display: “AL” and up/down arrows. Using the arrows keys, scroll up or down to the
         desired High Alarm set point (16% to100%). The MiniOX 3000 Oxygen Monitor
         “locks” this value. After five seconds, the monitor will beep once and automatically
         proceed to Monitoring Mode. (Press SET once after selecting set point to manually
         proceed to Monitoring Mode). NOTES: The High Alarm value CANNOT be set
         equal to, or less than, the Low Alarm value but CAN be disabled by increasing the
         alarm set point beyond 100% until “—“ is displayed. In order to retain alarm
         settings, do not remove battery.
     2.3.10.3. Low Battery Alarm. The MiniOX 3000 Oxygen Monitor features a two-stage
     battery alarm that warns of depleted and expired battery voltage.
         2.3.10.3.1. The first alarm alerts the operator that the monitor has approximately six
         hours of operating time remaining; “LOW BAT” appears in the display, with an
         audible alarm that sounds at 30-second intervals.
         2.3.10.3.2. If the operator does not replace the battery after this alarm, a second low
         battery alarm activates when the battery is no longer able to support monitoring. The
         monitor displays “LOW BAT” and the following: --- . In addition, audible/visual
         alarms are activated.
  2.3.11. Sensor Information.
     2.3.11.1. Replace the sensor if the following occurs: room air reading is greater than
     20.8% +/- 2% (18.8% to 22.8%) in Two-Point Linearity Check (See Manual), the
     MiniOX will not calibrate, “Sensor” “OFF” display and audible/visual alarms persist
     when sensor and cable connections are correct and cable is viable.
     2.3.11.2. To replace the sensor, verify that the monitor is turned OFF. The display
     should be blank. Disconnect the expired sensor from the coiled cable. Attach a new
     sensor to the coiled cable and firmly press the connector until the sensor snaps into place.
     Tighten the twist collar. Recalibrate the monitor. WARNING: The sensor is a sealed
     unit containing potassium hydroxide. If the sensor leaks, discard it immediately. The
     sensor contains a caustic material which can be fatal if swallowed and must be disposed
     of in accordance with Federal, State and Local regulations. If deployed, contact the local
     BMET or Base Environmental Engineer for disposal instructions. Should contact with
     skin or clothing occur; rinse area immediately with large quantities of water. In case of
     eye contact, immediately flush eyes with water for at least 15 minutes, holding eyes open.
     Contact a physician. NOTE: The sensors are warranted by the manufacturer for a useful
     life of 12 months. (However, the sensor is useful as long as the device calibrates to room
     air IAW para 2.3.6.) Sensor life starts at manufacturing. The manufacturing date appears
     on the side shaft of the sensor as a two-digit identifier. The first digit represents a month
     (A=JAN, B=FEB, C=MAR, D=APR, E=MAY, F=JUN, G=JUL, H=AUG, I=SEP,

2.4. Portable Therapeutic Liquid Oxygen System (PTLOX).
   2.4.1. Purpose. The PTLOX is designed to provide controlled flow of humidified oxygen
   from three (3) oxygen outlets when an aircraft oxygen source is unavailable. Oxygen is
   delivered to the converter outlets at a pre-set pressure of 50 +/- 5 pounds per square inch
   (psi), and a maximum flow rate of 15 LPM per outlet due to the limiting factor of (3) integral
   flow control valves, located in the accessory kit, each with the peak rate of 15 LPM per flow
   control valve, with an overall maximum oxygen flow rate of 45 LPM for the unit. A pressure
   gauge continuously registers oxygen delivery pressure.
      2.4.1.1. During all operational and Aeromedical Readiness Missions, the MCD will
      document on the AF Form 3829, or on the computer generated TRANSCOM Regulating
      and Command & Control Evacuation System (TRAC2ES) cover sheet: Total patient
      oxygen requirement; Total pre-mission PTLOX/therapeutic oxygen level; Total mid-
      mission PTLOX/therapeutic oxygen level; Total post-mission PTLOX/therapeutic
      oxygen level; Maximum cabin altitude during mission. NOTE: When using a Minilator
      and additional flow control valves or veriflow flow meters carried in the AE Inflight Kits,
      the maximum flow rate of 60 LPM may be achieved. WARNING: A dedicated PTLOX
      will be utilized for ventilated patients (only one ventilator will be connected to one
      PTLOX). Do not exceed the maximum flow rate of 60 LPM. If exceeded, ventilator(s)
      will not function properly.
   2.4.2. Parts.
      2.4.2.1. Container Assembly: The container assembly consists of three (3) gaseous
      oxygen outlets with dust caps, an operate button to check the level of liquid oxygen
      (LOX), a test button to check the battery condition, a pressure gauge to check the psi of
      the converter, a liquid oxygen filler port, a vent tube, four (4) securing straps, and an
      internal drip pan. NOTE: The internal drip pan is large enough to hold possible spillage
      and thus provides an added safety feature should a catastrophic system failure occur.
      Therefore no external drip pan is necessary.

      2.7.5.3. After the startup sequence, the oximeter begins sensing the pulse. Observe five
      seconds of continuous LED green-colored pulse quality before relying on the displayed
      values. NOTES: If the pulse quality display continues to blink yellow or red after 5
      seconds, try another finger. In some circumstances, the oximeter may interpret motion
      as good pulse quality. Minimize patient motion as much as possible. Moisture, blood
      pressure cuffs, infusion lines, anemia, arterial catheters, nail polish, and/or artificial nails
      may degrade the device’s performance. CAUTIONS: A flexible circuit connects the
      oximeter’s two halves. Do not twist or pull the flexible circuit or overextend the device’s
      spring. Do not use different types of batteries at the same time. Do not mix fully charged
      and partially charged batteries at the same time. These actions may cause the batteries to
      leak.
   2.7.6. Cleaning.
      2.7.6.1. Wipe the surfaces with a soft cloth dampened with a mild detergent or isopropyl
      alcohol solution. If low-level disinfection is required, a cloth dampened with 10% bleach
      / 90% water solution may be used. CAUTION: Do not use undiluted bleach or any
      cleaning solution other than those recommended here, as permanent damage could result.
      Do not immerse the oximeter in liquid or use caustic or abrasive cleaning agents.
      2.7.6.2. Dry with a soft cloth, or allow to air dry.
      2.7.6.3. Ensure that all surfaces are completely dry before use.
2.8. UNI-VENT “Eagle” Model 754M Ventilator.
   2.8.1. Purpose. The Uni-Vent 754M Ventilator provides or assists patients (adult, child, or
   infant) with ventilation when the patient’s respiratory efforts are absent or inadequate. The
   Uni-Vent 754M Ventilator is a portable (13 lbs.), electronically controlled ventilator,
   compressor, and air/oxygen mixer. The ventilator does not consume gas for operating power
   and may be operated without attachment of external gases. It is operable in any position,
   upright, on its side, or lying flat and has an operating temperature range of (–) 15 to (+) 120
   degrees Fahrenheit. WARNING: The Model 754M Ventilator is not recommended for use
   with neonate patients due to Tidal Volume Control being limited. Adjustment is available in
   10ml increments over a range of 0-3000ml. Additionally, adult breathing circuits are not
   recommended for use on small children or infants due to their compressibility and dead
   space. Disposable pediatric and infant breathing circuits are recommended in these cases or
   alternatively use Impact’s Child/Infant Re-useable Patient Valve Kit.
   2.8.2. Parts. Uni-Vent 754M Ventilator, Ventilator Circuit, Compressed Air Hose (yellow)
   with a female dual-end adapter, Oxygen Hose (green) with female dual-end adapter, Humi-
   Vent™ “artificial nose” 250– 1500cc, AC power cord adapter 90-265 VAC/47-400 Hz,

     2.8.2.5. EXHALATION VALVE: Low pressure fits ¼ in. tubing. Connects ventilator
     exhalation valve control port to disposable ventilator circuit exhalation valve (clear
     aluminum connector).
     2.8.2.6. EXTERNAL POWER JACK: Connects ventilator to Universal AC Power
     Supply or external 11-15 volt power source via 12 volts direct current (VDC) Power
     Cable.
  2.8.3. Power. Model 754M connects directly to AC outlets and is operable from 90-265
  VAC, 50-400Hz (voltage and line frequency sensing is automatic) and draws 1 Ampere.
     2.8.3.1. Model 754M DC operation range is 20-36 VDC (auto-sensing) and draws 5
     Amperes. The converter also accepts external DC voltages, ranging from 16 to 30 volts
     via the secondary input leads provided (no plug attached at shipment). Attachment to a
     mating connector is required and polarity must be observed. The black input lead is
     positive; the white is negative. Do not attach the braided shield. In addition, a 12 VDC
     Power Cable is provided for attachment to an automotive power source, negative ground.
     WARNING: Disconnect the ventilator from aircraft power when switching from
     auxiliary power unit (APU) to aircraft power to prevent an inadvertent power surge to the
     ventilator.
     2.8.3.2. Operating time on internal battery is 3-hours (maximum) using internal air
     compressor and 12-hours using external gas source. Recharging time ranges from 14-16
     hours depending on initial state of discharge. Battery icon LOW denotes battery power
     remaining is less than 30 minutes.
     2.8.3.3. Green charge indicator illuminates whenever sufficient battery recharging
     current is flowing.
     2.8.3.4. A fully charged battery pack will cause the CHARGE LED to turn off when
     connected to external power. The LED display battery icon will indicate “OK” when the
     external power is disconnected. NOTE: Two external fuse-holders are located on the
     top, left side of the Uni-Vent and each contains a 2 AG, 10A fuse. The fuse closest to the
     battery compartment door affects external power operation and battery operation and the
     other fuse affects battery operation and charging. “EXT PWR” and battery icon “ON
     CHG” will not display if their respective fuse(s) is/are blown or missing. Return to
     MERC for servicing. WARNING: External power surges may cause the ventilator fuse
     to blow.
24                                                                 AFI10-2909 23 JULY 2013


     2.8.3.5. Ventilator fuse failure is evidenced by the following:
         2.8.3.5.1. Ventilator automatically switches to battery power.
         2.8.3.5.2. Alarm message on the screen reads: “EXT PWR FAIL/DISCONNECT—
         CHECK SOURCE CONNECTIONS.” Audio alarm will sound and user will note a
         red alarm LED.
         2.8.3.5.3. If alarm mute button is pressed, user should note alarm message and be
         cognizant that the ventilator is running off battery power. The following occurs:
             2.8.3.5.3.1. Alarm message clears.
             2.8.3.5.3.2. Audio alarm stops.
             2.8.3.5.3.3. Alarm LED goes blank.
             2.8.3.5.3.4. A small blinking message continues to appear in the bottom right
             corner: “EXT CHK FUSE.” WARNING: This message may be easily
             overlooked during preflight and may be difficult to observe inflight. Audible
             alarm will not sound when the “EXT CHK FUSE” is displayed.
         2.8.3.5.4. If user does not press alarm mute button, alarm continues to display as
         noted in paragraph 2.8.3.5.2. above.
         2.8.3.5.5. In time, low battery alarms.      System failure occurs when battery is
         depleted.
  2.8.4. Pre-flight. Ensure equipment is within calibration requirement date and that this date,
  recorded on the AF Form 4368, will not be exceeded during the planned mission. Ensure AF
  Form 4033 is complete and present.
     2.8.4.1. Examine the Internal Compressor Air Filter, located on the top right side, for
     damage. Ensure the filter is in place and in good condition. CAUTION: Do not block
     the inlet or attempt to operate the internal compressor without filter in place. Do not
     attempt to clean this filter, replace if necessary.
     2.8.4.2. Visually observe the GAS OUT TO PATIENT Outlet. Ensure the Anti-asphyxia
     Valve is seated and not missing in order to prevent a pressure loss resulting in ventilator
     failure. NOTE: If the GAS OUT TO PATIENT Outlet is blocked, the pressure of the
     next mechanical ventilation may displace the Anti-asphyxia Valve resulting in a
     malfunction (i.e. loss of pressure). The valve can be quickly reseated by pushing its
     “flapper” inward using the rounded tip of a retracted pen or small hemostat.
     2.8.4.3. Connected to A/C power, turn Uni-Vent on. Display will show EXT PWR ON
     and ON CHARGE.
     2.8.4.4. Verify successful completion of SELF-Check. WARNING: SELF-CHECK and
     TRANSDUCER CALIBRATION must be performed with the disposable ventilator
     circuit disconnected from the patient. This ensures that the TRANSDUCER connection
     is open to ambient atmosphere. Ignoring this requirement would allow the procedure to
     sense any residual airway pressure in the patient circuit (a false reading). The residual
     pressure becomes the new calibration reference, which will increase your patient’s work-
     of-breathing by the residual amount.
AFI10-2909 23 JULY 2013                                                                        25


     2.8.4.5. Verify operating power selections: AC, SIMV, or CPAP.
     2.8.4.6. Check for positive indexing and operation of all switches and controls.
     2.8.4.7. Disconnect external power source and verify internal battery operation.
     2.8.4.8. Turn off. NOTE: Procedures 2.8.5.1.1 through 2.8.5.1.4.2 will be accomplished
     prior to departing home station if the patient will be placed on the pre-flighted ventilator.
  2.8.5. Performance. Only the five primary controls, common to most applications, are
  marked. They are numbered in order of use, in a 5-step sequence on the front panel.
     2.8.5.1. Primary Controls:
        2.8.5.1.1. Select operating mode; AC, SIMV, or CPAP
        2.8.5.1.2. Set VENTILATION RATE
        2.8.5.1.3. Set INSPIRATION TIME. (1:2 ratio is standard)
        2.8.5.1.4. Set TIDAL VOLUME. (10 ml per kilogram is standard)
        2.8.5.1.5. Set AIR OXYGEN MIXER
        2.8.5.1.6. For use with external oxygen, connect high-pressure green oxygen hose
        between OXYGEN inlet port and a 50-PSI external oxygen source. Use only medical-
        grade oxygen.
        2.8.5.1.7. For use with external air, connect a high-pressure yellow air hose between
        AIR inlet port and a 50-PSI external air source. Use only medical-grade compressed
        air.
        2.8.5.1.8. Connect a disposable ventilator circuit to its respective gas outlet,
        transducer, and exhalation valve connectors on the Uni-Vent Connector Panel.
        WARNING: The pressure line (blue vinyl tube) and the exhalation drive line (clear
        vinyl tube) must be placed on the ventilator circuit prior to utilizing the circuit on a
        patient. Minimal tidal volumes will be delivered if not intact.
        2.8.5.1.9. Connect test lung to ventilator circuit and set “high” and “low” pressure
        alarms 10 cm H2O above and below the current MAP that is shown on the unit.
            2.8.5.1.9.1. If ventilator alarms “Low Pressure,” check for a disconnected circuit.
            2.8.5.1.9.2. If ventilator alarms          “High     Pressure,”    check    for    an
            occlusion/compression on the circuit.
        2.8.5.1.10. After verification of ventilator function is complete, connect disposable
        ventilator circuit to patient. Observe patient and ventilator monitoring screen for
        adequacy of ventilation. Adjust alarms to specific levels required by the patients
        ventilating parameters. WARNINGS: DO NOT remove exhalation valve from
        inspiratory line. DO NOT place inspiratory line on patient without exhalation valve
        in place. Ventilator may malfunction if external oxygen or air source does not
        provide a pressure of 50-PSI. Impact 754M has a built in safety mechanism to turn
        the ventilator off and alarm when -10 cm H2O is sensed for 1.5 seconds. Ventilator
        shut down may occur in the following circumstances: closed-suctioning is performed
        at altitude, barometer inability to keep up with rapid aircraft pressure changes and
26                                                                AFI10-2909 23 JULY 2013


        excessive negative pressure from patient effort (forceful coughing, bronchospasm).
        Large patients with increased peak inspiratory flow demand are susceptible to the last
        occurrence. If inadvertent ventilator shut down occurs: disconnect patient from
        ventilator and manually ventilate patient with BVM. Turn the mode selector to
        “OFF.” Wait 2-3 seconds. Turn ventilator back on. The ventilator runs a self-check
        and recalibrates the airway pressure sensor. Return to normal operation. If further
        suctioning is required, consider using less negative pressure. NOTES: Anti-asphyxia
        one-way valve kit (P/N: 820-0096-15) can be procured to allow a spontaneous
        breathing patient to pull ambient air; i.e. non-sedated and paralyzed patients. If
        patient peak inspiratory flow exceeds 60 LPM, the valve opens for the portion of the
        inspiration which requires excess flow of 60 LPM. Ventilators used on the vast
        majority of patients should not require this valve. When using the PTLOX as the O2
        source, if 60 LPM cannot be delivered and subsequent pressure drops are below 35
        PSI, the ventilator will alarm and switch over to the internal compressor to ensure
        continued ventilation to the patient. For patients who require airborne infection
        control precautions, a HEPA filter (included in in-flight kit) will be placed inline,
        after the exhalation port. If expired body fluids block the filter, replace filter and
        continue patient ventilation.
        2.8.5.1.11. Connect Universal AC Power Supply between EXTERNAL POWER
        JACK and external power source.
     2.8.5.2. Secondary Controls.
        2.8.5.2.1. EXTERNAL AIR OFF/ON Pushbutton Switch: Permits the user to
        manually select external compressed air as primary air source. If Air Pressure is
        greater than 40 PSI, operation will begin. If a lower pressure or no pressure is sensed,
        the LCD will display “OFF” (default value) and the internal compressor will operate.
        2.8.5.2.2. SIGH OFF/ON Pushbutton Switch: Permits the Uni-Vent to operate with
        or without SIGH. When activated, the first ventilator generated breath will be a
        SIGH. Additional SIGH ventilations are delivered once every 100 ventilations or
        every 7 minutes, whichever comes first. Each SIGH does not exceed 3 seconds. SIGH
        becomes disabled in the CPAP mode, or when PRESSURE PLATEAU is “ON”.
        2.8.5.2.3. PEEP OFF/ON-SET Pushbutton Switch: Activates Uni-Vent’s internal
        PEEP control. Pressing the pushbutton allows a PEEP value to be manually entered.
        2.8.5.2.4. PRESSURE PLATEAU OFF/ON Pushbutton Switch: Permits ACV or
        SIMV operation with a pressure plateau. Pressing this pushbutton activates a
        PLATEAU value that is referenced 10 cm H2O below the HIGH PRESSURE.
        2.8.5.2.5. HIGH PRESSURE ALARM/PEAK INSPIRATORY PRESSURE RELIEF
        Control: Used to select HIGH PRESSURE ALARM and PEAK INSPIRATORY
        PRESSURE RELIEF set point. It has an absolute range from 15-100 cmH2O.
        2.8.5.2.6. LOW PRESSURE ALARM Control: Used to select the LOW PRESSURE
        ALARM set point. It has an absolute range from 0-50 cmH2O.
        2.8.5.2.7. ALARM MUTE/CANCEL Pushbutton Switch: Either mutes an audible
        alarm signal, or cancels a particular alarm function. OPERATING ALARM (30-
AFI10-2909 23 JULY 2013                                                                 27


        Seconds), BATTERY Alarms (5-Minutes), EXTERNAL POWER Alarm (until
        internal battery depletes, then, a BATTERY LOW Alarm also activates for 5-
        Minutes). Muting: This mutes the audible component of an Operating Alarm
        condition. Alarm muting is reset when the current alarm condition no longer applies
        or the mute-period is reached (alarm will resound). A new alarm condition overrides
        an already “muted” alarm. Canceling: Cancels the audible component of an Advisory
        Alarm condition. During APNEA alarm condition, it will cancel both the audible and
        visual APNEA alarms and the controlled ventilations that are automatically invoked
        at the onset of apnea. Cancellation of an APNEA alarm allows the Uni-Vent to
        resume operation at the preset ACV, SIMV or CPAP settings.
        2.8.5.2.8. MANUAL BREATH/TRIGGER Pushbutton Switch: Pressing this in
        normal operation delivers one MANUAL BREATH. Each time a MANUAL
        BREATH is triggered, an audible beep is heard. MANUAL TRIGGER functions as a
        backup when the primary system fails. While depressed, the MANUAL TRIGGER
        delivers a continuous gas flow at 30 LPM, with peak inspiratory pressure not
        exceeding 40 cmH2O.
     2.8.5.3. Operating alarms.
        2.8.5.3.1. VENTILATOR FAIL Alarm: Return the MODE Selector Switch to it's
        OFF position and then repeat this procedure. If SELF-CHECK fails again, DO NOT
        ATTEMPT PATIENT USE.
        2.8.5.3.2. BATTERY LOW/FAIL Alarm: Indicates when a low battery condition is
        sensed.
        2.8.5.3.3. EXTERNAL POWER LOW Alarm: Indicates when external power is less
        than 10.9 VDC.
        2.8.5.3.4. LOW PRESSURE Alarm: Indicates when PIP fails to exceed the LOW
        PRESSURE ALARM set point for two consecutive breaths and causes the LCD set
        point indicator to blink.
        2.8.5.3.5. DISCONNECT Alarm:        Indicates when a disconnect is sensed in the
        patient circuit.
        2.8.5.3.6. HIGH PRESSURE Alarm: Indicates when (Positive Inspiratory Pressure)
        PIP exceeds the HIGH PRESSURE ALARM set point for four consecutive breaths,
        or 2-seconds continuously, and causes the LCD set point indicator to blink.
        2.8.5.3.7. APNEA Alarm in ACV and SIMV: Indicates when approximately 19-
        seconds have elapsed and no pressure deflections have been sensed. In CPAP no
        spontaneous breathing is detected for 10-seconds.
        2.8.5.3.8. HIGH PEEP Alarm: Indicates when the inspiratory cycle begins before end
        expiratory pressure plateaus.
        2.8.5.3.9. O2 LOW/FAIL Alarm: Indicates when low pressure is sensed from an
        external oxygen supply.
        2.8.5.3.10. EXT AIR LOW/FAIL Alarm: Indicates when low pressure is sensed from
        an external source of compressed air.
 28                                                                  AFI10-2909 23 JULY 2013


          2.8.5.3.11. FIO2 Alarm: Indicates when the oxygen component or the air component
          of the AIR/OXYGEN MIXER is unable to meet its proportion of the gas mixture.
          2.8.5.3.12. PRESSURE ALARM SETTINGS Alarm: Indicates when the HIGH
          PRESSURE ALARM and LOW PRESSURE ALARM set points are reversed.
          2.8.5.3.13. VT Alarm: Indicates when delivered tidal volume does not equal set tidal
          volume.
          2.8.5.3.14. COMP Alarm: Indicates when the internal compressor output does not
          produce its intended contribution to tidal volume.
   2.8.6. Cleaning.
      2.8.6.1. Disconnect accessories and discard disposable items.
      2.8.6.2. Housing and pressure hose connections may be cleaned with a damp, soapy
      cloth and thoroughly dried with a lint-free cloth. CAUTION: DO NOT clean with
      abrasives or chlorinated hydrocarbon cleaners.
2.9. Airdyne Compressor.
   2.9.1. Purpose. The Airdyne Air Compressor provides a source of dry compressed air at 50
   pounds per square inch (PSI) +/- 5 PSI.
   2.9.2. Description. The compressor has two air outlets, one air inlet, and an information
   control panel.
   2.9.3. Parts. None.
   2.9.4. Power. Operates on 115 VAC, 50-60 Hz power.
   2.9.5. Pre-Flight. Ensure equipment is within calibration requirement date and that this
   date, recorded on the AF Form 4368, will not be exceeded during the planned mission.
   Ensure AF Form 4033 is complete and present. Ensure the power cable and plug are
   undamaged, the inlet filter is clean, and outlets are free of debris. Plug in the compressor and
   switch on. The pressure gauge should operate in the GREEN ARC (50 PSI +/- 5 PSI).
   Switch off. WARNINGS: Maximum flow rate from the compressor is 45 LPM at sea level
   and 41 LPM at 8,000 feet. If using this compressor to power a ventilator, ensure the airflow
   is adequate for the ventilator. The air compressor has a cabin altitude restriction of 8,000
   feet. Use of the compressor above this cabin altitude will cause inconsistent pressures. Only
   one ventilator may be operated with the air compressor at a time. The Airdyne 3500 Air
   Compressor is restricted to non-refueling, non-fuselage fuel carrying aircraft. Is not
   authorized for use in areas where explosive vapors may be present. The Airdyne 3500 Air
   Compressor® is not approved for use on the KC-135.
   2.9.6. Performance. Plug the power cable into a 115 VAC/50-60 Hz power source.
   Connect a low-pressure air hose to an air outlet, and switch on to blow out any dust or debris
   in the hose. Switch the compressor off and connect the hose to the medical equipment which
   will be powered by the compressor. Switch on the compressor; the pressure gauge should
   read 50 PSI +/- 5 PSI. Periodically verify operation and pressure output.
   2.9.7. Placement. Position the air compressor close to the item requiring compressed air,
   with the pressure gauge visible and the power switch accessible. Place one D-Ring on each

  side of the compressor. Attach one end of a cargo tie-down strap to one of the D-Rings.
  Route the strap halfway up the side of the compressor and hold it at this point. Route the
  strap horizontally at this level, wrapping it around the compressor. Run the strap under the
  vertical section and bring it up over the top of the compressor then down the other side, and
  under the horizontal portion of the strap. Secure the remaining end of the strap to the second
  D-Ring, tighten the strap snugly. Set the brakes on the compressor wheels. CAUTION: DO
  NOT over tighten the tie-down strap. Over-tightening will damage the wheels on the
  compressor.
  2.9.8. Disassembly. Switch off, disconnect the low-pressure air hose from the compressor
  outlet. Unplug the power cable, release the tie-down strap, and unlock the wheel brakes.

      following modes: OFF, MONITOR, DEFIB, and PACER.
      3.1.2.2. DEFIB ENERGY SELECT BUTTONS. Two sets of up-down arrow buttons
      control the defibrillator energy level, one set located on the front panel and the other
      located on the sternum paddle. Press and hold the appropriate up ▲ arrow or down ▼
      arrow button until the desired energy level is indicated on the display.
      3.1.2.3. DEFIB CHARGE. Pressing the CHARGE button on the front panel or, if
      using paddles, on the apex paddle handle, charges the defibrillator to the selected energy
      level.
      3.1.2.4. SHOCK. Each paddle has a SHOCK button located near the forward end of the
      handle. Press and hold both buttons simultaneously to discharge the defibrillator. The
      front panel has a single SHOCK button that illuminates when the defibrillator is charged
      and ready. This button is only active when using the Multi-Function Electrodes (MFE)
      Pads and the pads are connected to the patient.
      3.1.2.5. CHARGE INDICATOR LIGHT . Located on the apex paddle, this light turns
      on when the defibrillator is charged and ready.
      3.1.2.6. SOFTKEYS. Five unlabeled buttons located directly beneath the display
      control different functions depending on the operating mode of the unit. When the
      monitor is on, soft key function is displayed directly above each soft key.
      3.1.2.7. PACER OUTPUT. When pacing is selected, this control sets the milli-
      Amperage (mA) current delivered to the Multi-Function Electrode (MFE) Pads. For
AFI10-2909 23 JULY 2013                                                                      31


     conscious patients, it should be gradually increased until capture is recognized. Selected
     current setting is indicated on the display.
     3.1.2.8. PACER RATE. When pacing is selected, this control sets the Pulse-Per-Minute
     (ppm) rate at which the pacemaker will operate. It must be set above the patient’s
     intrinsic rate in order for the pacemaker to provide stimulation. The selected pace rate
     setting is indicated on the display.
     3.1.2.9. 4: 1 BUTTON. This control is used to test for threshold or to determine the
     patient’s underlying rhythm. When depressed this button causes pacing stimuli to be
     delivered at ¼ the indicated ppm setting. Releasing the control causes the instrument to
     resume normal pacing operation.
     3.1.2.10. LEAD. Selection of the ECG source is accomplished using the LEAD button.
     Pressing this button sequentially selects ECG signals derived from each of the following
     lead configurations; “I, II, III,” aVR, aVF, aVL, PADDLES” (defibrillation paddles), or
     PADS (Multi-Function Electrode (MFE) Pads) for display. NOTE: The “PADS, or
     “PADDLES” Lead setting is automatically selected when the instrument powers up in the
     DEFIB or MONITOR mode and MFE Pads or Paddles are connected to the Multi-
     Function cable. Lead II is automatically selected when the instrument powers up in the
     PACER mode. Pads or Paddles monitoring is not available in PACER mode.
     3.1.2.11. ALARM SUSPEND. This button is used to activate, deactivate and
     temporarily suspend all alarm functions. A bell symbol ( ) appears in the top-center of
     the display when the alarms are enabled. When the alarms are temporarily or
     permanently disabled, an “X” crosses through the bell symbol ( ). When the alarms are
     enabled, an alarm condition occurs, an audible tone sounds, and the bell symbol flashes.
     To avoid possible confusion with the defibrillator charged tone, the heart rate alarm tone
     sounds at a different frequency when the Selector Switch is set to DEFIB.
     3.1.2.12. SIZE. This control allows you to change the display size of the ECG signal.
     Size options are 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3 cm/mV and are indicated in the upper right center of the

  3.1.5. Performance.
     3.1.5.1. Monitor. ECG monitoring may be done through the ECG patient cable, Multi-
     Function Pads or through standard defibrillation paddles. Use of ECG patient cable is
     required, during pacing. To monitor through quick-look paddles, turn the monitor on,
     select paddles on LEAD SELECT, and apply conductive gel to paddles and place paddles
     firmly on the patient’s chest. Place the APEX paddle on the patient's chest wall, left
     side/mid-axillary just below the nipple, and STERNUM paddle to the right of the
     sternum, just below the clavicle. Observe the cardioscope to see the patient's rhythm.
     NOTE: Dry chest if necessary. Excessive chest hair may require shaving to allow
     proper adhesion of electrodes.
     3.1.5.2. The 12-LEAD patient cable with V-LEAD protective cab plugged in allows 4-
     LEAD monitoring of LEADS 1, 2, 3, and AVR, AVF, AVL. Attach electrodes to the
     ECG patient cable wires, and apply electrodes to the appropriate sites on the patient.
     NOTE: Ensure V-LEAD protective cap is plugged in V-LEAD connector.
        3.1.5.2.1. Lead placement.
            3.1.5.2.1.1. WHITE ("RA") - Right mid clavicular line below the clavicle.
            3.1.5.2.1.2. BLACK ("LA") - Left mid clavicular line below the clavicle.
            3.1.5.2.1.3. RED ("LL") - Between the 6th and 7th intercostal space left mid
            clavicular line.
            3.1.5.2.1.4. GREEN (RL) - Between 6th and 7th intercostal space right mid
            clavicular line.
        3.1.5.2.2. Turn selector switch to MONITOR, press the LEAD button until the
        desired lead configuration is selected (selected lead is indicated at the upper right of
        display). The manufacturer default setting is “PADDLES” or “PADS.”
     3.1.5.3. Pacemaker Monitoring. WARNING: Implanted pacemakers may cause the
     heart rate meter to count the pacemaker rate during episodes of cardiac arrest or
     arrhythmias. Pacemaker patients should be carefully observed. Check the patient’s
     pulse; do not rely solely on the heart rate monitor. Dedicated pacemaker detection
     circuitry may not detect all implanted pacemaker spikes; patient history and exam are
     important in determining the presence of an implanted pacemaker.
        3.1.5.3.1. Spikes from Implantable Pacemakers. The device is capable of
        detecting implantable pacemaker signals. The device will display a thin, solid line on
        the ECG trace whenever it detects a pacemaker signal. The waveform “spike”
        produced by the pacemaker will be displayed if the pacemaker is atrial, ventricular, or
        both.
     3.1.5.4. Recording. Recording of the ECG can be accomplished in any lead. The strip
     recorder will document the ECG trace with a 6 second delay at all times. To start the
     strip recorder, press the RECORDER button switch on the main control panel. The strip
AFI10-2909 23 JULY 2013                                                                        35


     recorder will run continuously until the button is pressed again. Each time the strip
     recorder is started, the time, date, ECG lead, size, and heart rate are printed on the top
     part of the paper. If the unit is pacing, the output current will also be printed. Similarly,
     if the defibrillator has been discharged, the delivery energy will be printed.
     3.1.5.5. Defibrillation.
        3.1.5.5.1. Turn SELECTOR SWITCH to DEFIB. The CCT unit is configured to
        use Rectilinear “Biphasic” Waveform defibrillation. Upon power-up the unit will
        automatically select the pre-configured energy level defaults (120 joule setting, with
        succeeding shock settings of 150 and 200 joules). Biphasic defibrillators require
        significantly less energy for effective defibrillation, therefore have lower default
        settings. WARNINGS: Neonatal and pediatric energy levels should be set based on
        specific clinical protocols using American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines. The
        AHA recommends the use of energy doses 2-4 j/kg, for both Monophasic and
        Biphasic defibrillators. The ZOLL M-Series CCT, (Biphasic) unit can be manually
        regulated to deliver 1 through 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 75, 100, 120, 150, and 200 Joules.
        A dry woolen or cotton blanket must be placed under the patient’s body for electrical
        insulation when defibrillation is performed on the aircraft floor. If any part of the
        patient contacts the floor, the distribution of current may be affected.
        3.1.5.5.2. Apply conductive gel to the paddles or electrode gel pads to the patient’s
        chest wall. WARNINGS: Do not permit excessive gel to accumulate between the
        paddle electrodes on the chest wall (Gel Bridge). This could cause burns and reduce
        the amount of energy delivered to the heart. If using defibrillator gel pads, make sure
        that the size of the pad is large enough to cover the entire paddle electrode area.
        3.1.5.5.3. Place STERNUM paddle on the patient’s right chest near the upper
        sternum, and the APEX paddle near the cardiac apex on the lower left chest.
        3.1.5.5.4. Multi-Function Electrode (MFE) pads may be used and will be applied
        according to instructions on the electrode packaging. Connect MFE pads to multi-
        function cable. Ensure good contact is made with MFE pads on patient's skin. Apply
        one edge of the pad securely to the patient and roll pad smoothly from that edge to the
        other being careful not to trap any air pockets between the gel and skin. NOTE: The
        messages "CHECK PADS" and "POOR PAD CONTACT" will be alternately
        displayed and energy will not be delivered if pads are not making good contact with
        the patient. The message "DEFIB PAD SHORT" will be displayed to indicate that a
        short circuit between MFE pads may exist.
        3.1.5.5.5. Press the CHARGE button on the front of the monitor or on the apex
        paddle handle. The charge indicator will flash, a climbing tone will be heard, and
        numbers will "scroll up" in the AVAILABLE ENERGY display until the selected
        energy is reached. The defibrillator will not discharge while in process of charging.
        WARNING: If both SHOCK buttons on the paddles are depressed when the
        CHARGE button is activated, the device will not charge and a RELEASE SHOCK
        BUTTON or other message will appear on the display. CAUTION: Changing the
        selected energy while the unit is charging or charged will cause the defibrillator to
        disarm. The energy display will blank while energy is being discharged internally
36                                                                AFI10-2909 23 JULY 2013


        (limit internal discharges to no more than 4 per minute). Press CHARGE button
        again to charge unit.
        3.1.5.5.6. After charging to the selected energy, the charge indicator on the apex
        paddle will light. A distinctive charge ready (continuous) tone sounds and the energy
        ready “DEFIB XXXJ READY” message will be displayed.
        3.1.5.5.7. Clear all personnel from patient contact area. WARNINGS: Warn all
        persons in the area to “stand clear” prior to defibrillation discharge. Do not touch the
        bed, patient, or any equipment connected to the patient during defibrillation. A
        severe shock can result. Do not allow exposed portions of the patient’s body to come
        into contact with metal objects, unwanted pathways for defibrillation current may
        result. Potential for electrical spark hazard when defibrillating with the ZOLL M-
        Series CCT is low due to Biphasic technology. When utilizing external paddles press
        firmly against the patient's skin to maximize electrode contact and use approximately
        25 lbs of pressure. This will also mitigate spark hazard.
        3.1.5.5.8. Use approximately 25 lbs. of pressure on the paddles. Using your thumbs,
        simultaneously press and hold both SHOCK buttons (on each paddle handle) until
        energy is delivered to the patient. Once energy is delivered, the display will show
        “XXXJ DELIVERED and DEFIB XXXJ SEL.” WARNING: Failure to use thumbs
        could result in the inadvertent depression of the ENERGY SELECT buttons, causing
        the defibrillator to disarm itself. Use of thumbs will also prevent inadvertent operator
        shock. No portion of the hand should be near the paddle plates. NOTE: If the
        defibrillator is not discharged within 60 seconds after reaching the selected energy
        level, the unit will automatically disarm itself.
     3.1.5.6. Synchronized Cardioversion. WARNING:            This procedure requires direct
     Physician supervision.
        3.1.5.6.1. Apply pads or paddles
        3.1.5.6.2. Turn selector switch to DEFIB
        3.1.5.6.3. Press Synch On/Off soft key
        3.1.5.6.4. Verify that the (↓) display over R-waves and “SYNC” displays.
        3.1.5.6.5. WARNINGS: Engage SYNC option for synchronized cardioversion; prior
        to attempting synchronized cardioversion, ensure ECG signal is good and SYNC
        marks (↓) are displayed above each QRS complex. The defibrillator/cardioverter will
        seem to pause before it shocks because it is awaiting the next QRS complex. The
        electrical shock is delivered a few milliseconds after the R wave so that it appears to
        land on the QRS complex. This avoids the delivery of an electrical shock during
        cardiac repolarization (or relative refractory period represented on the surface ECG as
        the T wave), a period of particular vulnerability during which an electrical shock can
        precipitate ventricular fibrillation (VF). If additional counter shocks are necessary,
        readjust the energy level as necessary, press the SYNC soft key and repeat. “SYNC
        XXX SEL” must be displayed prior to pressing the CHARGE button.
     3.1.5.7. Non-Invasive Transcutaneous Pacing. NOTE: NTP may be accomplished in-
     flight with the ZOLL M-Series Monitor due to low biphasic energy and output current.
AFI10-2909 23 JULY 2013                                                                        37

        electrode first (to the left side mid thorax), applying one edge to patient and roll
        smoothly; then apply the front electrode (left side mid thorax) in similar manner.
        3.1.5.7.2. Turn Selector Switch to PACER, press the LEAD button until the desired
        lead configuration is selected (selected lead is indicated at the upper right of display).
        The manufacturer default setting is “LEAD II.” Pads or Paddles monitoring is not
        available in PACER mode.
        3.1.5.7.3. Set pacer rate by turning PACER RATE ppm knob to a value 10-20 ppm
        higher than intrinsic rate. If no intrinsic rate exists, use 100 ppm.
        3.1.5.7.4. Set pacer output by turning PACER OUTPUT mA knob clockwise
        slowly. The pacer output will increment or decrement by a value of 2 mA on the
        display when the knob is turned. When the device is switched out of pacer mode into
        Defib or Monitor mode and then switched back the pacer settings will remain
        unchanged. If unit is turned off more than 10 seconds, the pacer default settings will
        be restored.
        3.1.5.7.5. Determination of capture will be assessed both electrically and
        mechanically in order to assure appropriate circulatory support of the patient.
        Determination of electrical capture will be performed by viewing the ECG on the
        screen while ECG cable is attached to patient. Use of other monitoring devices may
        cause pacer artifacts. Mechanical capture is assessed by palpation of peripheral pulse.
        In order to avoid mistaking muscular response to pacing stimuli for arterial pulsations
        only femoral, right brachial or radial arteries will be palpated. The ideal output
        current is the lowest value that will maintain capture. This is usually about 10%
        above threshold. Typical threshold currents are between 40 and 80 mA. Location of
        MFE pads will affect the current required to obtain ventricular capture. The
        placement that offers the most direct current pathway to the heart while avoiding
        large chest muscles will usually produce the lowest threshold.
        3.1.5.7.6. Pressing and holding the 4:1 button can be used to temporarily withhold
        pacing stimuli thereby allowing the operator to observe the underlying rhythm and
        morphology. When depressing the 4:1 button pacing stimuli is delivered at 1/4 the
        indicated ppm setting. WARNINGS: Do not touch the gelled area of the MFE pads
        or place pads over the patient monitoring electrodes; electrical shock and burn hazard.
        MFE pads should be replaced after 8 hours of continuous pacing (2 hours for
        radiolucent stat pads). Pacing in excess of 30 minutes, particularly in neonates or
        adults with severely restricted blood flow, may cause burns. Periodic inspection of
        underlying tissue is required. If the unit was not turned off and less than 10 minutes
        have elapsed since pacing mode was last used, reactivating pacer mode causes pacing
        to immediately resume at recent settings.
     3.1.5.8. Pediatric Pacing. WARNING: This procedure requires direct Physician
     supervision with Pediatric or Neonatal care background.

  3.2.6. Performance:
     3.2.6.1. Monitor. Monitoring View appears on the display when the Therapy Knob is in
     the Monitor position. The HeartStart MRx can be used for ECG and arrhythmia
     monitoring, allowing you to monitor through, multifunction electrode pads, or 3-, 5-, or
     10-lead monitoring electrode ECG sets. If both pads and monitoring electrodes are
     connected, monitoring allows you to select a lead from the 3-, 5- or 10-lead monitoring
     electrode ECG source, or to monitor through pads. Lead II is configured as the primary
     ECG lead source and is displayed in Wave Sector 1. You may change this during use
     with the Lead Select button.
     3.2.6.2. Waveforms may be acquired through the therapy port for pads,/paddles or the
     monitoring port for 3-, 5-, or 10-lead monitoring electrodes. Monitoring View can
     display up to four ECG waves. To monitor through quick-look paddles, turn the monitor
     on, select paddles on LEAD SELECT, and apply conductive gel to paddles and place
     paddles firmly on the patient’s chest. Place the APEX paddle on the patient's chest wall,
     left side/mid-axillary just below the nipple, and STERNUM paddle to the right of the
     sternum, just below the clavicle. Observe the cardioscope to see the patient's rhythm.
     WARNING: Do not use the HeartStart MRx to monitor neonatal ECGs. Doing so could
     result in inaccurate measurements and alarms. NOTE: Dry chest if necessary.
     Excessive chest hair may require shaving to allow proper adhesion of electrodes.
  3.2.7. Electrode Lead Placement. WARNING: Be sure that the electrodes do not come in
  contact with other conductive materials, especially when connecting or disconnecting the
  electrodes to/from the patient. Avoid touching monitoring electrodes and other measuring
  devices when they are applied to the patient. Doing so can degrade safety and may affect
  results.

  erratic spiking problems caused by a properly or improperly functioning pacemaker.
  Pacemaker patients should be carefully observed. Check the patient’s pulse; do not rely
AFI10-2909 23 JULY 2013                                                                           43


  solely on the heart rate monitor. In patients with cardiac pacemakers, the HeartStart MRx
  may have reduced sensitivity and not detect all shock able rhythms.
  3.2.9. Recording. The Print button initiates a continuous print-out of the primary ECG and
  other selected waveform(s) either real-time or with a 10-second delay, depending on your
  configuration. Recording of the ECG can be accomplished in any lead. To start the strip
  recorder, press the Print button switch on the main control panel. The strip recorder will run
  continuously until the button is pressed again. Each time the strip recorder is started, the
  time, date, ECG lead, size, and heart rate are printed on the top part of the paper. If the unit is
  pacing, the output current will also be printed. Similarly, if the defibrillator has been
  discharged, the delivery energy will be printed. Pressing the button while printing is in
  progress stops the printing.
  3.2.10. Defibrillation:
     3.2.10.1. Defibrillation is always performed through paddles or pads. Once you have
     performed the necessary preparation for defibrillation, perform the following steps:
     3.2.10.2. Select Energy - To select the energy setting, rotate the Therapy Knob to the
     desired energy level. WARNINGS: Biphasic and Monophasic defibrillation for adult
     and pediatric energy levels should be set based on specific clinical protocols using
     American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines. The Phillips HeartStart MRx® unit can
     be manually regulated and range from 1 to 200, with 150J the recommended level for
     adult patients. A dry woolen or cotton blanket must be placed under the patient’s body
     for electrical insulation when defibrillation is performed on the aircraft floor. If any part
     of the patient contacts the floor, the distribution of current may be affected.
     3.2.10.3. Selecting the 1-10 (1-9) energy setting displays the Select Energy menu, with a
     default setting of 6J. The low energy setting can be changed using the Navigation
     buttons to increase or decrease the desired setting. Complete your selection by pressing
     the Menu Select button. Your current energy selection is shown in the Shock Status area
     of the display (120 joule setting, with succeeding shock settings of 150 and 200 joules).
     Biphasic defibrillators require significantly less energy for effective defibrillation and
     therefore have lower default settings.
     3.2.10.4. Apply conductive gel to the paddles or electrode gel pads to the patient’s chest
     wall. WARNINGS: Do not permit excessive gel to accumulate between the paddle
     electrodes on the chest wall (Gel Bridge). This could cause burns and reduce the amount
     of energy delivered to the heart. If using defibrillator gel pads, make sure that the size of
     the pad is large enough to cover the entire paddle electrode area.
     3.2.10.5. Place STERNUM paddle on the patient’s right chest near the upper sternum,
     and the APEX paddle near the cardiac apex on the lower left chest.
     3.2.10.6. Multi-Function Electrode (MFE) pads may be used and will be applied
     according to instructions on the electrode packaging. Connect MFE pads to multi-
     function cable. Ensure good contact is made with MFE pads on patient's skin. Apply one
     edge of the pad securely to the Patient and roll pad smoothly from that edge to the other
     being careful not to trap any air pockets between the gel and skin.
44                                                                  AFI10-2909 23 JULY 2013


     3.2.10.7. Clear all personnel from patient contact area. WARNINGS: Warn all persons
     in the area to “stand clear” prior to defibrillation discharge. Do not touch the bed,
     patient, or any equipment connected to the patient during defibrillation. A severe shock
     can result. Do not allow exposed portions of the patient’s body to come into contact with
     metal objects, unwanted pathways for defibrillation current may result. When utilizing
     external paddles press firmly against the patient's skin to maximize electrode contact and
     use approximately 25 lbs of pressure. This will also mitigate spark hazard.
  3.2.11. Synchronized Cardioversion. WARNINGS:               This procedure requires direct
  Physician supervision. Engage SYNC option for synchronized cardioversion; prior to
  attempting synchronized cardioversion, ensure ECG signal is good and SYNC marks (↓) are
  displayed above each QRS complex. The defibrillator/cardioverter will seem to pause before
  it shocks because it is awaiting the next QRS complex. The electrical shock is delivered a
  few milliseconds after the R wave so that it appears to land on the QRS complex. This
  avoids the delivery of an electrical shock during cardiac repolarization (or relative refractory
  period represented on the surface ECG as the T wave), a period of particular vulnerability
  during which an electrical shock can precipitate ventricular fibrillation (VF). If additional
  counter shocks are necessary, readjust the energy level as necessary, press the SYNC soft key
  and repeat. “SYNC XXX SEL” must be displayed prior to pressing the CHARGE button.
     3.2.11.1. Apply pads or paddles
     3.2.11.2. Turn selector switch to DEFIB, Press Synch On/Off soft key
     3.2.11.3. Verify that the (↓) display over R-waves and “SYNC” displays.
  3.2.12. Non-Invasive Transcutaneous Pacing.
     3.2.12.1. Turn Selector Switch to PACER, press the LEAD button until the desired lead
     configuration is selected. Pacing View appears when the Pacer soft key is set to the
     Pacer Mode.
     3.2.12.2. Non-invasive transcutaneous pacing therapy is used to deliver pace pulses to
     the heart. Pace pulses are delivered through MFE pads that are applied to the patient’s
     bare chest. While in Pacer Mode, the ECG strip and Event Summary are easily annotated
     with event information. Set pacer rate by turning PACER RATE ppm knob to a value
     10-20 ppm higher than intrinsic rate. If no intrinsic rate exists, use 100 ppm. NOTES:
     Use only approved lead sets when pacing with the HeartStart MRx. Failure to do so may
     introduce noise and result in intermittent leads off messages. NTP may be accomplished
     in-flight with the HeartStart MRx due to low biphasic energy and output current. Flight
     Nurses may initiate pacing in-flight IAW AHA ACLS protocols.
     3.2.12.3. For treatment of patients with implantable devices such as permanent
     pacemakers or cardiovert defibrillators, consult a physician and the instructions for use
     provided by the device’s manufacturer.
     3.2.12.4. Waveforms, ECG monitoring, measurements, and most alarms remain active
     and retain their settings when you transition from Monitor or Manual Defib Mode to
     Pacer Mode. However, the waveform displayed in Wave Sector 4 is replaced by the

     wave markers also appear on the ECG until capture occurs. NOTE: R-wave markers do
     not appear on paced beats
     3.2.12.5. The HeartStart MRx can deliver paced pulses in either demand or fixed mode.
     3.2.12.6. In demand mode, the pacer only delivers paced pulses when the patient’s heart
     rate is lower than the selected pacing rate.
     3.2.12.7. In fixed mode, the pacer delivers paced pulses at the selected rate. WARNING:
     Use demand mode pacing whenever possible. Use fixed mode pacing when motion
     artifact or other ECG noise makes R-wave detection unreliable or when monitoring
     electrodes are not available.
     3.2.12.8. To prepare for pacing:
        3.2.12.8.1. If not pre-connected, connect the pads cable to the HeartStart MRx by
        aligning the white pointer on the pads cable with the white arrow on the green
        Therapy port. Then push until you hear it click into place.
        3.2.12.8.2. Make sure the multifunction electrode pads packaging is intact and within
        the expiration date shown.
        3.2.12.8.3. Connect the pads connector to the pads cable.
        3.2.12.8.4. Apply MFE pads according to the instructions on the pouch. Apply back
        electrode first (to the left side mid thorax), applying one edge to patient and roll
        smoothly; then apply the front electrode (left side mid thorax) in similar manner.
        Prepare the patient’s skin prior to applying the pads. Skin is a poor conductor of
        electricity, so skin preparation is important in achieving good contact.
            3.2.12.8.4.1. If necessary, clip hair at the electrode sites (or shave sites if needed).
            3.2.12.8.4.2. Clean and abrade the skin at the electrode site.
            3.2.12.8.4.3. Dry the electrode sites briskly to increase capillary blood flow in the
            tissues and to remove oil and skin cells.
        3.2.12.8.5. If pacing in demand mode, apply monitoring electrodes and connect the
        ECG cable to the HeartStart MRx.
        3.2.12.8.6. Set pacer output soft key PACER OUTPUT mA. The pacer output will
        increment or decrement by a value of 2 mA on the display.
        3.2.12.8.7. Determination of capture will be assessed both electrically and
        mechanically in order to assure appropriate circulatory support of the patient.
        Determination of electrical capture will be performed by viewing the ECG on the
        screen while ECG cable is attached to patient. Mechanical capture is assessed by
        palpation of peripheral pulse. In order to avoid mistaking muscular response to
        pacing stimuli for arterial pulsations only femoral, right brachial or radial arteries will
        be palpated. The ideal output current is the lowest value that will maintain capture.
        This is usually about 10% above threshold. Typical threshold currents are between
        40 and 80 mA. Location of MFE pads will affect the current required to obtain
        ventricular capture. The placement that offers the most direct current pathway to the
        heart while avoiding large chest muscles will usually produce the lowest threshold.
46                                                                 AFI10-2909 23 JULY 2013


         WARNINGS: Do not touch the gelled area of the MFE pads or place pads over the
         patient monitoring electrodes; electrical shock and burn hazard. MFE pads should be
         replaced after 8 hours of continuous pacing (2 hours for radiolucent stat pads).
         Pacing in excess of 30 minutes, particularly in neonates or adults with severely
         restricted blood flow, may cause burns. Periodic inspection of underlying tissue is
         required. If the unit was not turned off and less than 10 minutes have elapsed since
         pacing mode was last used, reactivating pacer mode causes pacing to immediately
         resume at recent settings.
  3.2.13. Pediatric Pacing. WARNING:            This procedure requires direct Physician
  supervision with Pediatric or Neonatal care background.
     3.2.13.1. Non-invasive pacing of pediatric patients is done in an identical manner to
     adults. Smaller size pediatric MFE Pads are required for patients weighing less than
     33lbs/15Kg. NOTES: Pediatric MFE pads are not carried in the AE in-flight kit and
     must be supplied by Pediatric or Neonatal transport teams as required.
  3.2.14. NIBP (Non-invasive Blood Pressure) Monitoring.

5.1. Chest Drainage Unit.
   5.1.1. Purpose. Chest drainage units evacuate air and/or fluid from the chest cavity or
   mediastinum of patients with chest tubes. The treatment goal is to re-establish lung
   expansion and restore breathing dynamics. In addition, the chest drainage unit may facilitate
   postoperative collection and reinfusion of autologous blood from the patient’s pleural cavity
   or mediastinal area. Drainage may be either by “straight drainage” to gravity, or by
   “controlled suction.”
      5.1.1.1. Atrium Express 4050 Dry Seal Chest Drain is a disposable, waterless operating
      system with 2100 ml collection volume, dry suction regulator, dry one-way valve for seal
      protection, and air leak monitor with redundant water seal protection. NOTE: Water is
      not required for seal protection or drain operation. However, sterile fluid is required for
      air leak detection and water seal function.
   5.1.2. Preflight. Inspect the drainage unit package for signs of damage. If the package is
   damaged, dispose of the item.
   5.1.3. Performance.

          can be adjusted to any suction setting between -10cmH2O and -40cmH2O. Suction
          regulator is preset to -20cmH2O. Dial down to lower the suction setting and dial up
          to increase. CAUTION: Suction source should be set to -80mmHg or higher for
          chest drain regulator settings of 20cmH2O or greater. When additional negative
          suction greater than 20cmH2O is needed, it is necessary to use the suction canister
          connected in-line with the suction device (i.e. Impact 326M). Failure to do so will
          cause inaccurate negative pressure readings. NOTE: The suction source vacuum
          should be greater than -80mmHG when multiple chest drains are connected to a
          single suction source.
          5.1.3.1.4. To lower regulator setting from a higher level (-40cmH2O) to a lower level
          (-20cmH20), adjust regulator down to lower setting and then temporarily depress the
          filtered manual high negativity vent (located on top of the drain) to reduce excess
          vacuum. NOTE: The Express incorporates an advance automatic high negativity
          relief valve. This filtered valve activates automatically to limit system pressure to
          approximately -50cmH2O. WARNING: Do not use manual high negativity vent
          when suction is not operating or when the patient is on gravity drainage
AFI10-2909 23 JULY 2013                                                                          69


          5.1.3.1.5. To verify suction operation: check the bellows, located below the suction
          regulator control dial. The bellows will expand only when suction is operating. The
          monitor bellows will not expand when suction is not operating or disconnected. The
          calibrated ▲ mark allows quick and easy confirmation of vacuum operation over a
          wide range of continuously adjustable suction control settings.
          5.1.3.1.6. If the bellows is observed to be expanded, but less than the ▲ mark, the
          vacuum source pressure must be increased to -80mmHg or higher. NOTE: When
          vacuum is present in the collection chamber, a    symbol will remain visible in the
          vacuum indicator window (located to the right of the suction regulator). When
          vacuum is not present (atmospheric pressure) no symbol will appear. All patient tube
          connections and the vacuum indicator window should be checked regularly for
          vacuum confirmation.
          5.1.3.1.7. Fill the air leak monitor to the fill line by syringe (no needle) with 45 ml of
          sterile water or sterile saline via the needless injection port located on the back of the
          drain. WARNING: Do not use or puncture needleless luer port with needle. NOTE:
          When bubbles are observed going from right to left, this will confirm a patient air
          leak. Continuous bubbling will confirm a persistent air leak. Intermittent bubbling
          will confirm the presence of an intermittent air leak. No bubbling will indicated no
          air leak is present.
          5.1.3.1.8. Disconnection of unit. Do not separate the unit from the patient without
          clamping off the patient chest tube(s) first.
      5.1.3.2. Positive Relief Protection valve. This valve is located on the top of the drain (to
      the left of the Manual Negativity Vent) and acts similarly to the Heimlich valve. After
      loss of altitude, the pressure valve opens instantly to release accumulated positive
      pressure. WARNING: Use of the Heimlich valve with the Atrium Express could cause
      great risk to a patient during rapid decompression. Do not obstruct the positive pressure
      relief valve.
      5.1.3.3. Placement. Always place chest drain below the patient’s chest in an upright
      position. To avoid accidentally knocking over chest drain hang the system from the litter.
5.2. Heimlich Valve.
   5.2.1. Purpose. The Heimlich valve prevents the flow of air or fluid back into the patient’s
   chest cavity. The Heimlich valve consists of a hard, clear plastic tube that connects inline
   between the patient’s chest tube and the chest drainage unit or drainage collection container.
   Inside the plastic tube is a flutter valve that allows only one-way flow of air and fluid through
   the tube, even during aircraft depressurization emergencies. NOTE: If a one-way valve is
   inherent to the chest drainage unit, a Heimlich valve is not required. All chest tubes attached
   to straight drainage (e.g. foley bag) require a Heimlich valve. Monitor chest tube patency.
   5.2.2. Preflight. Inspect the Heimlich valve and the sterile package for any signs of
   damage. If any signs of damage are present, dispose of the entire package. Ensure that two
   (2) large Kelly clamps with latex tubing over the clamp jaws are available.
   5.2.3. Performance. WARNING: The ends of the Heimlich valve and all connections must
   remain sterile. Always ensure that a closed system is maintained.
 70                                                                AFI10-2909 23 JULY 2013


      5.2.3.1. Using the two Kelly clamps, double clamp the chest catheter close to the
      patient’s chest wall.
      5.2.3.2. Attach the distal end of the catheter securely to the blue end of the Heimlich
      valve.
      5.2.3.3. Attach the distal end of the Heimlich valve to the tubing connected to an
      approved closed chest drainage unit.
      5.2.3.4. Ensure the arrow on the Heimlich valve points away from the patient’s chest.
      5.2.3.5. Secure all connections with adhesive tape. DO NOT use masking tape.
      5.2.3.6. Remove both clamps from the chest catheter and store them near the patient.
      WARNING: Store the clamps by the patient’s side, in case emergency clamping of the
      chest catheter is required.
      5.2.3.7. If the valve becomes obstructed, use sterile technique to replace the Heimlich
      valve.
5.3. Airborne Life Support System (ALSS).
   5.3.1. Purpose. The ALSS Model 185 Infant Transport Incubator provides a controlled
   environment for supporting an infant’s thermal requirement during transportation. The ALSS
   Incubator also has provisions for humidification and an enriched oxygen environment in the
   infant chamber.
   5.3.2. Parts. Storage capability for 2 “D” or “E” size oxygen cylinders at the left front and
   rear. A double-walled hood with access doors covers the infant mattress and tray. The hoods
   are assembled one over the other and secured together by 4 hood securing knobs. An oxygen
   regulator for the oxygen cylinders. A non-sparking wrench for the oxygen cylinder valve
   and regulator. A 50 cc Luer-Lock syringe. Two (2) humidification sponges with precut
   notches. An extra mattress cover (pillowcase).
   5.3.3. Power.
      5.3.3.1. Power sources for the ALSS are 115VAC/50 – 400 Hz and an internal battery.
      5.3.3.2. A fully charged battery will operate the incubator for 3 hours with an ambient
      temperature of 20° C (68° F) and the infant chamber at 37.0° C (98.6° F) after warming
      initially to 37.0° C on AC power.
      5.3.3.3. Battery charging times with the incubator switched “OFF” are 10 hours to 90%
      capacity, and 16 hours to 100% capacity.
   5.3.4. Preflight.
      5.3.4.1. Ensure equipment is within calibration requirement date and that this date,
      recorded on the AF Form 4368, will not be exceeded during the planned mission. Ensure
      AF Form 4033 is complete and present.
      5.3.4.2. Inspect the incubator for any signs of damage. If either hood is cracked, do not
      use the incubator.
      5.3.4.3. Ensure that all 4 hood-securing knobs and all 4 slide-latches are in the locked
      position prior to moving the incubator.
AFI10-2909 23 JULY 2013                                                                       71


     5.3.4.4. Inventory the accessory kit (listed under “Parts”) for all items and ensure they
     are serviceable.
     5.3.4.5. Ensure the oxygen cylinders are secured and have at least 1000 (psi). Ensure a
     plastic washer is in place between the regulator and the oxygen cylinder valve outlet.
     5.3.4.6. Connect the incubator to 115 VAC/50-400 Hz power source.
     5.3.4.7. Switch the incubator “ON” and ensure the AC OP Indicator illuminates. NOTE:
     The ALSS temperature sensors detect temperatures within the normal operating range of
     50° Fahrenheit and greater. When the sensors detect a temperature below normal, it
     displays “System Fail” or “Sensor Failure” until the temperature returns to a normal
     setting. This may take up to 2 hours. To preclude this from happening, after cold
     weather storage, remove the hoods, remove the infant support tray, and turn the incubator
     “ON” using AC power. This allows the incubator to warm to room air in about 15
     minutes. Replace the infant support tray and hoods after the 15-minute period.
     5.3.4.8. Open the porthole on the right of the front panel of the hood, and place an
     ungloved hand over the right end of the infant support tray and ensure airflow is present.
     Close the porthole.
     5.3.4.9. Set the temperature control to 37.0° C and observe for a rise of temperature on
     the incubator temperature display. Test the observation light by switching it “ON” then
     “OFF.” Press and hold the test switch and ensure all LED’s illuminate and the audible
     alarm sounds.
     5.3.4.10. Disconnect the incubator from AC power and ensure the battery operation LED
     illuminates. Repeat the pre-flight test from checking airflow at the right end of the infant
     tray to pressing the test switch to ensure proper operation on battery power. Reconnect
     the incubator to AC power and switch “OFF” the incubator and ensure the battery charge
     LED is illuminated.
     5.3.4.11. Check the condition of the oxygen cylinder tank clamps and ensure IV pole is
     secured in its storage bracket on the rear panel of the incubator. Ensure the mounting
     straps are in place at the end corners of the frame, and ensure they are serviceable and not
     damaged.
  5.3.5. Performance.
     5.3.5.1. Connect the incubator to 115 VAC/50-400 Hz source.
     5.3.5.2. Install a humidification sponge. Fill the humidification reservoir with 150 cc of
     sterile distilled water. Water for the initial wetting of the sponge may be introduced
     directly into the reservoir by removing the hoods and the infant support tray.
     Alternatively, the reservoir may be filled by syringe through the luer fitting marked fill
     (to the left of the control panel). In either case the filling should not exceed 150 cc of
     water. The fill rate through the luer fitting should not be greater than 100 cc per minute
     (50 cc per 30 seconds).
     5.3.5.3. When the reservoir is filled with 150 cc of water, the incubator will provide a
     45% humidification level for 8 hours. Should the infant require a humidification level
     greater than 45%, additional humidity may be introduced into the infant chamber by use
     of a rubber access port and an external humidification/nebulization source.
72                                                                  AFI10-2909 23 JULY 2013


     5.3.5.4. Use oxygen connector tubing connected to the humidifier/nebulizer outlet and
     placed through a rubber access port to deliver humidified/nebulized oxygen to the infant
     chamber. It takes approximately 10-15 minutes for oxygen concentrations to stabilize in
     the chamber.
     5.3.5.5. If oxygen is required, the use of a humidifier/nebulizer is recommended.
     Connect a flow meter to an oxygen source, and a humidifier/nebulizer assembly.
     5.3.5.6. Check the humidity sponge every 4-5 hours.
     5.3.5.7. This is accomplished through the luer fitting marked drain (to the left of the
     control panel).
     5.3.5.8. Open the drain line by disconnecting it from the male luer fitting mounted on the
     frame.
     5.3.5.9. Use the 50 cc syringe to apply suction to the drain fitting, and measure the
     quantity of water drained.
     5.3.5.10. If the quantity is 5cc or greater return that water through the fill port. No
     additional water is required.
     5.3.5.11. If the quantity collected is 1 cc to 5 cc, replenish with no more than 30 cc of
     water.
     5.3.5.12. If less than 1 cc is collected, replenish with no more than 60 cc of water.
     5.3.5.13. Set the temperature selector to 37.0° C. Switch the incubator “ON." The
     incubator heater takes about 10 minutes to reach this temperature when the ambient
     temperature is 20° C.
     5.3.5.14. After initial warm up, set the incubator temperature as ordered by the
     physician. (Normal temp order will be between 32-34° C). NOTES: Take the
     temperature of the infant every hour unless directed otherwise by the medical attendant.
     Document temperature on Patient Evacuation Record (DD Form 602, Patient Evacuation
     Tag or AF IMT 3899, Patient Movement Record). Avoid exposure to direct sunlight as
     this may cause significant temperature increases within the infant chamber.
     5.3.5.15. If the IV pole is to be used, remove it from its storage retainer on the rear of the
     incubator.
     5.3.5.16. Set and engage the IV pole into the pole-securing hole at the base of the lamp.
     Pull up on the pole to ensure it is secure.
     5.3.5.17. Place the infant in the infant chamber through the front access door onto the
     mattress in the support tray. The infant’s head may be positioned either forward or aft in
     the aircraft. Place the securing straps through the appropriate sets of slots in the support
     tray and secure the infant without over tightening the straps.
  5.3.6. Alarms. There are 7 alarm conditions to alert the operator to possible problems.
  WARNING: The activation of any alarm indicates a need to completely assess the infant and
  closely monitor infant temperature.
     5.3.6.1. HIGH TEMPERATURE ALARM illuminates when the temperature in the
     infant chamber exceeds 38.5°C. The incubator remains fully functional.
AFI10-2909 23 JULY 2013                                                                           73


       5.3.6.2. SYSTEM FAIL ALARM indicates the secondary sensor has detected an
       incubator temperature greater than 39.2° C. The incubator heater is disabled until the
       temperature is below 39.2° C.
       5.3.6.3. HIGH TEMPERATURE AND SYSTEM FAILURE ALARM indicates that the
       primary temperature sensor detects a temperature over 39.0° C. The incubator’s heater
       system will be disabled until the temperature is < 39.0° C.
       5.3.6.4. AIR FLOW ALARM indicates an airflow blockage by some object such as a
       blanket. The heater system will be disabled until the incubator cools, and the obstruction
       is cleared.
       5.3.6.5. SENSOR FAIL ALARM indicates a possible failure of the primary temperature
       sensor or control circuitry and will disable the heater. NOTE: The activation of any
       “FAIL” alarm requires BMET personnel to check the incubator.
       5.3.6.6. LOW BATTERY ALARM indicates approximately 15 minutes of operation
       remains.
       5.3.6.7. POWER FAIL INDICATOR illuminates when the battery voltage falls below a
       fixed point, indicating that the battery has reached its safe discharge limit. Power to
       maintain the temperature in the infant chamber is no longer available.
   5.3.7. Placement.
       5.3.7.1. Place the incubator on a litter. Loosen the incubator's litter mount straps by
       depressing the release lever on the strap buckles. Press the litter pole clips onto the litter
       poles directly below the end corners of the incubator and tighten the straps. It is
       recommended that the litter pole clips be placed straight down from the end corners of
       the incubator.
       5.3.7.2. The ALSS should be positioned in an aircraft tier at a level that is optimum for
       observing the infant. Due to the height of the incubator, it may not be feasible to place a
       litter directly above the incubator.
5.4. Litters.
   5.4.1. Purpose.
       5.4.1.1. The Litter is used to provide a safe means of transporting non-ambulatory
       patients.
   5.4.2. Description. There are two primary litters in the inventory.
       5.4.2.1. NATO Litter. The patient support material is green canvas with wooden poles
       and lifting handles. The spreader bar allows the litter to fold or expand length-wise, in
       half. NOTE: Litters with canvas tears up to 1 inch are acceptable. Litter with canvas
       tears of greater than 1 inch require service and will not be used for patient transport.
       WARNING: Do not exceed a 250 lb max load on the NATO litter.
       5.4.2.2. Army Decon Litter.        The patient support material is green or black
       polypropylene with aluminum poles and nylon (telescoping) handles. Litter pole length
       can be adjusted from 90 inches to 94.4 inches to accommodate placement in helicopter.
       The spreader bar allows the litter to fold or expand length-wise, in half. WARNINGS:
 74                                                                 AFI10-2909 23 JULY 2013


      Do not exceed a 350 lb max load on the Decon litter. Nylon litters are not approved for
      AE missions due to the slick surface which will cause patient movement during take-off
      and landing. In the interest of safety and to prevent a tripping hazard, AECMs / litter
      bearers are discouraged from walking backward when carrying weighted litters
      (equipment/patients/mannequins).
   5.4.3. Preflight. Open the litter and inspect for damage. Ensure the litter handles and
   spreader mechanisms are intact. Inspect handle locking mechanisms for proper operation on
   the litter, as applicable.
   5.4.4. Performance. Open the litter and engage spreader mechanism. Ensure adjustable
   handles on litter, as applicable, are secured in the extended position.
      5.4.4.1. The patient is placed on the litter, covered with the sheet and blanket as
      necessary, and secured to the litter with 2 litter straps. The straps are placed mid-thigh
      and on the upper chest of the patient. Secure the litter straps so the buckles are on the
      aisle side of the litter, and lay the excess strap flat over the patient. DO NOT tie the
      excess strap in a knot. Litter straps will be visible for inspection.
      5.4.4.2. A mattress pad is recommended to prevent skin breakdown.
      5.4.4.3. CPR may be conducted on the litter when the shoulders are positioned above the
      cross-bars and patient is easily accessible.
5.5. NATO Litter Backrest.
   5.5.1. Purpose. The NATO Litter Backrest is used to provide elevation for a patient’s head
   while on a NATO Litter or Army Decon litter, but will not fit on the OSL. The NATO Litter
   Backrest is composed of a metal U-shaped frame that clamps to a NATO Litter by spring
   mechanism in 2 positions: 30 degrees and 90 degrees. A material cover fitting over the metal
   frame functions as support to the body.
   5.5.2. Pre-flight. Check the NATO Litter Backrest Frame for any tears or damage.
   5.5.3. Performance. Clip the backrest frame at the head end of the litter inside the stirrups
   of the litter in either the 30 degree or 90 degree position. The frame is reversed to produce
   one angle or the other. Slide the backrest cover over the frame with the cover flap to the foot
   end of the litter. Tuck the flap smoothly under the patient or mattress if applicable. Ensure
   that the patient’s head does not extend above the top of the backrest frame.
      5.5.3.1. Secure the patient with a minimum of 2 litter straps. Secure 1 strap across the
      patient and around litter at mid-thigh. Secure the other strap across the patient’s chest in
      the auxiliary region and around the litter through the litter stirrups. WARNINGS: Proper
      placement of the litter straps is required to retain both the patient and the NATO backrest
      in position during deceleration after landing. The 90 degree position will not be used for
      takeoff, landing, enplaning or deplaning. A 3 or 4 person carry will be used when
      enplaning/deplaning a litter patient with a NATO backrest in place. In the interest of
      safety, AECMs may revert back to a 2 -person carry once inside the aircraft. Ensure that
      the patient can reach their emergency oxygen mask when the backrest is in place.
AFI10-2909 23 JULY 2013                                                                         75


5.6. The North American Rescue OverSized Litter (OSL)
   5.6.1. Purpose. The OSL is a bifold type litter designed to support non-ambulatory patients
   of excess weight and extreme abdominal girth. When fully extended it measures 90” x 31”x
   6”. It uses a Nomex/kevlar blend material and has three seat belt type patient restraints
   attached at top and bottom of the litter.
   5.6.2. Preflight. Inspect the OSL for damage and serviceability.
   5.6.3. Placement. Use a minimum of 6 litter bearers to enplane the OSL. However, there
   are four attached carrying straps on each side of the litter to accommodate up to eight
   personnel. Place a blanket or mattress pad under the OSL to reduce vibration. The North
   American Rescue Products /OSL has been approved for use on board the following aircraft:
   C-130 E/H, C-5, KC-10, KC-135, C-17 and C-130J.
       5.6.3.1. On the C-130 aircraft, secure the litter in any centerline litter tier to allow for
       ease of enplaning and deplaning. The stirrups should be resting on the aircraft floor.
       5.6.3.2. On the KC-10/135 aircraft, patients on an OSL will not be transported in the
       PSP. Patient will be floor loaded or secured to a pallet. Request a Halverson Lift,
       Tunner, Hi-lift truck etc. for patient enplaning/deplaning. NOTE: To prevent damage to
       the KC-135 aircraft floor, appropriate shoring must be used under floor-loaded litters.
       Coordinate with the BO to secure appropriate shoring material. An aircraft pallet may
       also be used to secure the litter(s).
   5.6.4. Securing Procedures. Ensure proper position of the litter on the aircraft floor. Insert
   5,000 lb cargo tie-down strap into “D” ring on aircraft floor near litter handle at the head of
   the litter. Wrap the cargo strap around the handle once, then extend the strap and wrap
   around the handle at the head of the litter directly across from it. Insert the hook end of the
   cargo strap into a “D” ring near the opposite handle then tighten. Perform same procedures
   at the foot of the litter using the litter handles and cargo tie-down straps. WARNING: Do
   not use a NATO backrest during take-offs, landings, and emergency situations in which
   potential failure on the NATO backrest may occur.
       5.6.4.1. On the C-17 aircraft, patients will be floor loaded or secured to a pallet.
       CAUTION: When opening and folding the OSL, the litter support brackets can be
       difficult to open and could create a potential pinch hazard. Strongly suggest use of two
       personnel when opening and closing the OSL. Gloves should be worn when handling
       this device. NOTE: When securing the patient NATO litter straps should be used in
       addition to the seat belt type patient restraints attached to the litter to ensure proper
       positioning.
5.7. Politzer Bag.
   5.7.1. Purpose. The Politzer Bag is used to relieve altitude related ear blocks.
   5.7.2. Parts. The Politzer Bag consists of 3 components: a rubber bulb, a tube, and a nasal
   tip.
   5.7.3. Pre-flight. Ensure all 3 components are present, and that there is no damage to any of
   the parts.
 76                                                                  AFI10-2909 23 JULY 2013


   5.7.4. Performance. Treat and/or manage the ear block IAW AFI 41-307, AE Patient
   Considerations and Standards of Care. If these measures fail and ear block persists, attempt
   to clear the blockage with the Politzer Bag.
       5.7.4.1. Place the tip of the Politzer Bag in one nostril. NOTE: If the patient’s nasal
       opening is too small for the Politzer Bag tip, remove the tip and insert the tube into the
       nasal opening. DO NOT insert the tube farther than 3/4 inch. If the rubber tubing is also
       too large, remove the tubing from the bulb, and use the bulb tip in the nostril. DO NOT
       insert the tip of the bulb farther than 1/2 to 3/4 inch into the patient’s nostril.
       5.7.4.2. Seal the nose by gently squeezing it and ask the patient to swallow.
       5.7.4.3. Squeeze the bulb firmly, while the patient begins to swallow. The sudden
       increased pressure in the Nasopharyngeal Cavity should open the Eustachian Tubes,
       allowing the pressure in the Middle Ear to equilibrate with the ambient pressure.
       5.7.4.4. Repeat as necessary.
5.8. Leather Restraints.
   5.8.1. Purpose. Restraint sets provide physical restraint for the acute exacerbation of
   psychiatric or behavioral disorders inflight that may place the aircraft, crew, and other
   patients and passengers at risk. WARNING: When applying physical restraint, there is a
   potential to produce serious consequences, such as physical and psychological harm, loss of
   dignity, violation of an individual’s rights, and even death. The restraints will not be used to
   secure the patient to the litter or any aircraft part.

5.9. Stryker Wedge Turning Frame 965 Military Option (MO).
   5.9.1. Purpose. The Stryker Wedge Turning Frame with integral Versitrack cervical
   traction system is used to transport patients, up to 250 lbs, who are paralyzed, have traumatic
   back or spinal cord injuries, or extensive soft tissue injuries. The turning frame allows the
   patient to be turned either from the supine to prone position or vice versa. Critical care
   patients may also be transported on the Stryker frame. In addition, this platform should be
   considered as an option to floor loading on opportune aircraft. NOTE: For AE transport a
   waiver will be obtained IAW para 1.5 of this instruction.
      5.9.1.1. The Versitrack System, mounted to the head end of the frame is designed to
      provide constant cervical traction not affected by changes in momentum. The
      graduations are in 5 pound increments, accurate within + 2 pounds. The traction force
      will remain constant as long as the patient does not change position on the litter relative
      to the traction device. The litter can be rotated freely without affecting the traction force.

        center of the base assembly. WARNING: Injury could result if the Litter Support
        Base moves out of position while patient on litter is transferred on to the Litter
        Support Base. Always apply the brakes when patient on litter is transferred to the
        Litter Support Base. Push on the Litter Support Base to ensure the brakes are
        securely locked. If the brakes do not hold properly, turn the unit into host medical
        equipment maintenance activity/MTF for repair.
     5.9.5.2. Turning Frame (Patient Litter).
        5.9.5.2.1. Posterior Frame. Prior to patient placement, ensure the posterior frame is
        placed on the half of the turning ring marked “posterior frame” and on the bolt
        marked “posterior frame” at the head end of the Turning Frame (patient litter).
        Secure with knurl nut. NOTE: There is a cutout held by a spring in the posterior
        frame. For bedpan use or to access the patient, remove one side of the spring from
        the canvas at this cutout.
        5.9.5.2.2. Anterior Frame. Anterior frame must be placed on the bolt marked
        “anterior frame” at the head end of the Turning Frame (patient litter). Secure with
        knurl nut. WARNINGS: The knurl nut at the head end of the posterior litter frame
        must kept tight when patient is on the frame and the knurl nut at the anterior frame
        must be kept tight when the patient is being turned. When securing the posterior or
        anterior frames grasp the lanyard with knurl nut to prevent the knurl nut from
        swinging freely during frame placement. The knurl nut could strike the patient if not
        controlled.

        and purpose.
AFI10-2909 23 JULY 2013                                                                       81


        5.9.5.2.4. Turning ring. The turning handles on the ring should always be on the
        patient’s left side. The turning ring can be separated into half rings. To remove the
        anterior half of the ring, unlock and open the ring completely and slide the ring half
        off the hinge pin (toward the head end of the litter). To replace the half ring, reverse
        the process. On the turning ring there is a turning lock (red knob) pip pin, and thigh
        clearance adjustment bar. WARNING: Never use the turning ring as a means for
        lifting or carrying the Stryker Frame.
        5.9.5.2.5. Turning lock (red knob). Allows the ring to rotate on the curved track.
        Released by pulling the knob outward.
        5.9.5.2.6. Pip pin. Allows the ring to be opened and secured. The ring is locked
        over a patient when an audible “click” is heard.
        5.9.5.2.7. Thigh Clearance Adjustment. Can be adjusted when the anterior frame
        is being placed on the patient. The anterior frame should fit snuggly. If there is too
        much pressure on a large patient or too little pressure on a small patient when the
        turning ring is completely closed, unlock the ring and adjust the frame by turning the
        knurled nuts on the ring up or down. NOTE: If adjusting the thigh clearance still
        does not allow for the turning ring to be comfortably closed around the patient, the
        operator can remove the black mattress, which is attached to the anterior turning
        frame.
        5.9.5.2.8. Turning Frame (patient litter) Lifting Handles. A four-person carry is
        required to lift, transport, or remove the Turning Frame (patient litter) from the Litter
        Support Base. Lift handles are located at each corner of the Turning Frame (patient
        litter).
        5.9.5.2.9. Turning Frame (patient litter) Ball Lok Release Pins. Release pins are
        located near the jack actuators and allow the Turning Frame (patient litter) to be
        separated from the Litter Support Base. NOTE: The jack actuators may raise as the
        Turning Frame (patient litter) is lifted up off the Litter Support Base. Keep the
        Turning Frame (patient litter) level and lift until the support tubes clear the jack
        actuators before moving forward. WARNINGS: The Turning Frame foot-end slide
        brackets (the bar underneath the bed frame, just forward of the turning ring) create a
        possible pinch point. Use caution when moving the Turning Frame top to avoid
        injury. The frame the patient is resting on is not secured to the Turning Frame or the
        Litter Support Base. A litter strap must be secured around the underneath bottom
        frame handle to the turning ring support bar for added stability.
        5.9.5.2.10. Arm Board/Side rail. Arm boards are removable and can also be moved
        up and down, forward and back, tilted and locked in any one of four positions. When
        the arm boards are in the full up position they serve as a side rail or can be used to
        support the bedpan. The arm boards are adjustable forward and aft along the
        perimeter of the Turning Frame. WARNING: Arm boards must be lowered and in
        the down position or removed and patients arms secured with litter straps prior to
        turning.

        Frame (patient litter). Tray can be adjusted up and down and can also be positioned
        forward and aft. WARNING: The meal tray holder should be in the down position
        prior to turning the patient. In addition, if the patient is large or muscular, the meal
        tray holder may have to be removed prior to patient turning to prevent the patient’s
        arms/shoulders from striking the meal tray.
        5.9.5.2.13. Wheel Chocks. Wheel chocks must be used with the Stryker Frame to
        protect the aircraft floor and evenly distribute the weight of the Stryker 965 over a
        greater surface area. The chocks can be used under the base to support the entire
        Stryker unit or under the litter legs to support the Turning Frame (patient litter)
        separately.
     5.9.5.3. Traction. WARNING: Originating facilities are responsible for placing
     patients on the Stryker Frame. Traction may be applied on the flight line but will require
     a flight surgeon or attending physician to maintain traction on the patient while initial
     traction is being set.
        5.9.5.3.1. To apply, place the patient’s head in the traction harness. Attach the hooks
        at the top of the harness to the outer hooks of the spreader bar. Attach the “S” ring on
        the traction device cord to the mid portion of the spreader bar. NOTES: The traction
        cable must be deployed at least one inch from the “S” hook to the hub of the traction
        device. Turn the force adjustment knob counterclockwise, while observing the
        graduated scale, until the desired amount of traction force is reached. If you need to
        reduce the amount of traction force after the initial setting, turn the knob back
        clockwise to a position 5 pounds less than the required setting and then
        counterclockwise to the desired setting. Traction setting must be checked and
        documented at least every 60 minutes.
     5.9.5.4. Enplaning.
        5.9.5.4.1. Enplane, chock and secure the base unit prior to enplaning the patient on
        Turning Frame (patient litter). If the base can be rolled onto the aircraft, use a
        minimum of two people. CAUTION: To prevent damage to the fifth wheel (STEER
        MODE), disengage the wheel while on the aircraft, aircraft ramp, or in other
        situations where the majority of the units weight is concentrated on this wheel.
        5.9.5.4.2. Lower the base hydraulic rods for ease of attaching the Turning Frame
        (patient litter).
        5.9.5.4.3. Prior to enplaning the patient on the litter brief all personnel and the patient
        of the activity; ensure the Securing Locking Pin is engaged.
        5.9.5.4.4. The patient must be on the Stryker posterior frame (in the supine position)
        for enplaning/deplaning.
        5.9.5.4.5. Ensure the patient is secured with three litter straps placed high on the
        chest, at the patient’s waist and mid-thigh. Apply the straps around the patient and
        the posterior frame.
AFI10-2909 23 JULY 2013                                                                     83


        5.9.5.4.6. If the “Half Ring” is in place, ensure pip pin is engaged and secured.
        5.9.5.4.7. At a minimum, a 4-person carry must be utilized to safely transport the
        Turning Frame (patient litter) and when removing it from the Litter Support Base.
        5.9.5.4.8. Bring the Turning Frame (patient litter) aboard and install onto the Litter
        Support Base unit. Align the holes on the actuator rods and litter bar by lining up the
        scored line on the top of the actuator rod with the hole on the support bar. Insert the
        Ball Lok pins.
     5.9.5.5. Securing the Base.
        5.9.5.5.1. Ensure the brakes are locked and then choose an option to secure to the
        aircraft floor.
        5.9.5.5.2. There are three options when securing the Litter Support Base unit to the
        aircraft floor.
        5.9.5.5.3. The recommended (and preferred) tie-down procedure is to use the tie-
        down rings secured with four CGU-1/B cargo tie-down straps to outboard aircraft
        floor D-rings.
            5.9.5.5.3.1. Two additional CGU-1/B cargo tie-down straps will be tied from the
            bed frame to the aircraft floor D-rings. Cargo straps from bed frame should have
            slack.
        5.9.5.5.4. A second tie-down option is to use the tie-down rings secured with four
        CGU-1/B cargo tie-down straps to inboard aircraft floor D-rings. Complete tie-down
        procedure with method described in 5.9.5.5.3.1.
        5.9.5.5.5. A third tie-down option is to use the outboard tie-down rings secured with
        four CGU-1/B cargo tie-down straps to aircraft floor D-rings. This is the least
        preferred method. WARNING: Use either outboard or inboard tie-down methods
        only; certain combinations of methods can be ineffective.
     5.9.5.6. Securing The Turning Frame Only.
        5.9.5.6.1. To secure only the Turning Frame to the aircraft floor use the single end

Table A2.3. PT LOX Operating Time Formula
PT LOX OPERATING TIME FORMULA:
Total LPM X 60 X Duration of mission in hours = Mission’s LOX Requirement
                       804
Example: You are transporting patients on a 3-hour mission with a combined flow rate of
20LPM. How much liquid oxygen will you need for the mission?
20 X 60 X 3 = 3600
3600/804 = 4.48 liters of liquid oxygen.
For a 3-hour mission with a total flow rate of 20 LPM you would need 4.48 Liters of Liquid
Oxygen. NOTE: The end result gives you the amount of liquid oxygen for the duration of the
mission; however, you will need to plan ahead for unexpected ground delays and possible
diversions.

K             3.14                  200 psi
MOST          4.35                  200 psi
NOTES:
Oxygen/Compressed Cylinder Duration =
(Gauge psi in tank – Residual Pressure) x Cylinder Constant
                     Total Flow Rate in LPM
The end result gives you the amount of time remaining in minutes at that flow rate.
Example: Determine the life of an E tank with a pressure of 2000 psi and a flow rate of 15
LPM.
2000-200= 1800
1800 X .28 = 504
504/15 = 33.6 minutes
At 15 LPM your E tank with 2000 psi would last approximately 33.6 minutes.
