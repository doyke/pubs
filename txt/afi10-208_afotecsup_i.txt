SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication is substantially revised and requires a complete review. Major changes reflect
recent updates to new DOD continuity related instructions and incorporates guidance for
business continuity as a subset of continuity. This rewrite reflects the transfer of HAF continuity
program, planning and execution responsibilities and associated Pentagon emergency
management and incident command responsibilities to the Air Force District of Washington
(AFDW). It also outlines HAF organizational responsibilities for continuity, personnel
accountability and emergency evacuation. It implements requirements for Balanced Survivability
Assessments in the Air Force. It establishes AF responsibilities for emergency management and
incident command of the Pentagon facilities and authorities for Raven Rock Mountain Complex.

                                           Chapter 1

 DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE CONTINUITY AND BUSINESS CONTINUITY
                           GUIDANCE

1.1. Air Force Continuity.
   1.1.1. It is Air Force guidance to maintain a comprehensive and effective continuity
   capability to preserve Air Force functions, missions and capabilities in support of DOD and
   Air Force Primary Mission Essential Functions (PMEFs).
   1.1.2. All levels of command will plan, budget and be prepared to execute their Mission
   Essential Functions (MEFs), support execution of the Air Force and DOD PMEFs, project
   forces supporting Combatant Commanders (CCDRs), and when directed by the Secretary of
   Defense (SecDef), support civil and humanitarian requests.
   1.1.3. Continuity requirements must be incorporated into the daily operations of
   organizations to ensure seamless and immediate continuation of essential functions during
   and after a wide range of emergencies, including local or regional natural disasters, health-
   related emergencies, man-made disasters, accidents, technological limitations or attack-
   related emergencies.
   1.1.4. Air Force military, civilian and contract personnel with continuity responsibilities
   should know what actions to take without warning, across a wide range of potential
   emergencies.
   1.1.5. Continuity is a primary enabler of operational capability.
      1.1.5.1. Continuity is focused on maintaining the capability to perform the mission and
      the essential functions which comprise the mission.
      1.1.5.2. Continuity is best achieved through integration with the suite of programs that
      enable operational capability to continue with limited or no impact to mission execution,
      should an event or other disruption occur. Organizations and installations should develop
      integrated solutions among all programs that most effectively and efficiently enhance
      mission execution. These include integrated defense/force protection, anti-terrorism,
      critical infrastructure program (CIP)/critical asset risk management (CARM) and
      emergency management.
      1.1.5.3. Continuity planning should consider all-hazards, but emphasize events or other
      disruptions which will most likely degrade operations.
      1.1.5.4. Risk management methodologies, focused on the continuation of mission
      capability, should be used to identify and develop mitigation solutions, which should in-
      turn be used to prioritize and justify the allocation of budgetary resources.
   1.1.6. Continuity requires unity of effort between the mission owner and the installation to
   establish protection priorities on the installation.
   1.1.7. Business continuity is a collaborative effort among continuity, integrated defense,
   anti-terrorism and emergency management programs. Business continuity must comply with
   military and civilian personnel policies, to include telework guidance established by Deputy
 6                                          AFI10-208 _AFOTECSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2013


     Chief of Staff for Manpower, Personnel and Services (AF/A1) and computer system security
     requirements established by Chief of Warfighting Integration and Chief Information Officer
     (SAF/CIO A6).
1.2. Continuity Guidance. COOP planning should remain operationally focused on command
and control and prioritized through contingency and crisis planning.
1.3. Continuity Preparedness Objectives.
     1.3.1. Ensure the Air Force can continue its essential functions under all conditions.
     1.3.2. Ensure availability of personnel, critical assets, essential facilities, equipment, records
     and other assets necessary to continue MEFs in the event of a disruption.
     1.3.3. Execute a successful order of succession and/or delegation of authority in the event a
     disruption renders leadership unavailable or incapable of executing their responsibilities
     and/or exercising their authorities.
     1.3.4. Execute return to normal operations upon termination of a continuity event.

                              COOP PLAN DEVELOPMENT

3.1. Writing COOP Plans. COOP plans should use planning factors contained in this
instruction and War & Mobilization Plan, Vol 1 (WMP-1), Basic Planning. To ensure fully
integrated response operations, commanders should include COOP plans with other installation
plans, such as the Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP), Integrated Defense
Plan (IDP), Antiterrorism (AT) Plan, Disease Containment Plans or other plans as long as all
COOP planning factors, risks and controls are addressed. If Commands combine COOP plans
with their other plans, such as CEMP, title the plan "CEMP/COOP- (organization designation)."
Although AFMAN 10-401, Volume 2, Planning Formats and Guidance, is the recommended
plan format, organizations can adopt any format that best achieves their planning goals or as
directed by the MAJCOM.
3.1. (AFOTEC)AFOTEC COOP plans/planning guidance will be focused on the
performance of the critical tasks directly supporting AFOTEC MEF(s) (See AFOTEC-
added Attachment 7). The second priority of AFOTEC COOP planning is to reconstitute
MEFs in primary, permanent operating locations as quickly as possible, and the third priority is
the performance of business continuity functions (BCFs). Unit COOP planning efforts
associated with a specific contingency event must address the performance of critical tasks
directly supporting the AFOTEC MEF(s). BCFs can be addressed IAW paragraph 2.4.6. and/or
be conducted in conjunction with other unit emergency management actions (installation,
emergency response, etc.).
   3.1.1. COOP plans should comply with guidance in the following documents:
       3.1.1.1. AFDD 3-10, Force Protection
       3.1.1.2. AFI 10-2604, Disease Containment Planning Guidance – plan for continuation
       of MEFs during a pandemic or other contagious biological event or outbreak.
       3.1.1.3. AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and
       Operations – plan for continuation of MEFs during or following a major accident, natural
       disaster, conventional attacks (including high-yield explosives), or terrorist use of
       Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) materials. Incorporates CEMP
       10-2.
       3.1.1.4. AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting – comply with reporting requirements upon
       COOP activation and movement to alternate locations.
       3.1.1.5. AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations Planning and Execution – comply with
       reporting requirements.
       3.1.1.6. AFI 10-701, Operations Security (OPSEC) – comply with security requirements.
       Develop OPSEC standards based on the priority of the MEF.
       3.1.1.7. AFPD 10-24, Air Force Critical Infrastructure Program (CIP) – implements a
       mission-focused, Air Force Task Critical Asset (TCA) identification and Critical Asset
       Risk Assessment (CARA) process. All CIP critical assets are designated as TCAs, with a
       subset of this list being designated as Defense Critical Assets (DCAs).
 16                                       AFI10-208 _AFOTECSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2013


         3.1.1.7.1. War Mobilization Plan I (WMP-1) – contains additional factors to assist with
         planning efforts.
         3.1.1.8. AFI 10-245, Antiterrorism
         3.1.1.9. AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense.
3.2. Classifying COOP Plans. Classify COOP plans according to content, as required by
applicable overarching program security guidance, MEFs, mission criticality, capabilities, key
personnel movement, compilation of data revealing additional associations or relationships and
the specific plan(s) supported. COOP plans directly supporting the national essential functions
or DoD or AF primary MEFs will be not be marked lower than secret. Other COOP plans will
not be marked lower than For Official Use Only (FOUO).
   3.2.1. Use DoD Defense Continuity Program (DCP) Security Classification Guide, (15 Dec
   05) for details and to determine specific classification decisions ambiguity exists and/or no
   original classification authority (OCA) is available.
   3.2.2. Refer to the “Continuity of Operations (COOP) /Continuity of Government (COG)”
   Community of Practice for the Defense Continuity Security Classification Guidance
   (SIPRNet) or contact coop@pentagon.af.mil or coop@af.pentagon.smil.mil for a copy.
3.3. COOP Plan Review. Organizations are required to validate and update their COOP plan
every two years.
3.4. Elements of a Continuity Plan. COOP plans should be executable with and without
warning, during and after duty hours and should include the following elements:
      3.4.1. Mission Essential Functions. Prior to writing continuity plans, organizations should
      thoroughly analyze their organization’s mission, functions, supporting activities,
      communication and vital records/data necessary for successful mission execution. Refer to
      Attachment 3 for further guidance.
      3.4.1. (AFOTEC) AFOTEC organizations will align their critical supporting tasks to the
      AFOTEC Mission Essential Function(s) as defined in the AFOTEC-added Attachment 7 to
      this supplement. These critical supporting tasks are the basis for any AFOTEC COOP
      planning and must be performed or mitigated under all circumstances. See AFOTEC-added
      Attachment 9 for additional guidance.
         3.4.1.1. Identify MEFs. Prioritize MEFs based on the impact of interruption and degree
         of acceptable interruption.
         3.4.1.2. Identify leadership, personnel, facilities, equipment, computer and
         communication technologies, supplies and/or other resources necessary to execute each
         MEF.
      3.4.2. Orders of Succession and/or Delegation of Authority.
         3.4.2.1. Plan for order of succession and/or delegation of authority in the event a
         disruption renders leadership unavailable or incapable of executing their responsibilities
         and/or exercising their authorities.
         3.4.2.2. Commanders will establish, promulgate, and maintain orders of succession and
         delegation of authority for key positions. Orders of succession are an essential part of
AFI10-208 _AFOTECSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                     17


     organizations’ continuity plans and should have sufficient breadth, depth and geographic
     dispersal, where feasible.
     3.4.2.3. Procedures and conditions for delegation of authority must be documented in
     COOP plans and should indicate the extent and limits of the delegated authority. The
     description of the conditions for implementation should include specific ‘triggers’ for
     when the permission to act for the principal may be used as well as when that permission
     is no longer authorized.
  3.4.3. Key Personnel.
     3.4.3.1. Identify key military, civilian and contractor positions with COOP
     responsibilities under normal and emergency procedures. Ensure position descriptions
     and contract statements of work clearly reflect COOP requirements.
     3.4.3.2. Establish alert and notification procedures for key personnel. Ensure others are
     available through recall procedures to augment key personnel. Develop accountability
     procedures for all AF personnel.
     3.4.3.3. Establish force health protection standards for key and other personnel.

   operations and/or reconstitution.
       3.4.7.1. For PMEFs and MEFs, plan options for return to normal operations and
       reconstitution regardless of the level of disruption that originally prompted COOP
       execution. This may include moving operations from the continuity or devolution
       location to either the original operating facility or, if necessary, to a new operating
       facility.
       3.4.7.2. Verify that all systems, communications, and other required capabilities are
       available and operational and that the facility is fully capable of accomplishing all
       essential functions and operations.
3.5. Risk Mitigation.
3.5. (AFOTEC)Risk Mitigation. The two primary mitigation strategies innately incorporated
into AFOTEC’s force structure and operating philosophies ensure AFOTEC MEF(s) continue in
all environments are: (1) AFOTEC MEF capabilities are widely dispersed throughout the U.S.,
and can be conducted at and/or transferred to other locations; and (2) Each AFOTEC
detachment/GSU is capable of supporting AFOTEC MEF(s) through standardized operational
test processes and methodology through the use of information technology/networks.
   3.5.1. Apply risk mitigation methodologies during the Readiness and Preparedness/Normal
   Operations Phase to mitigate risk to MEF execution. Refer to Attachment 4 of this AFI for
   further information.
   3.5.2. Plans should place increased planning emphasis on the events most likely to occur and
   which will most likely degrade operations beyond acceptable limits.
3.6. Planning Phases: The COOP implementation process will include the following planning
phases:
   3.6.1. Readiness and Preparedness / Normal Operations Phase. During normal daily
   operations, COOP readiness should ensure identification and protection of
   successors/military authority, accuracy of personnel accountability and readiness of
   relocation sites. As information and intelligence increase the likelihood of an event or other
   disrpution, every effort should be made to plan or implement pre-emptive relocation or
   establish an initial operating capability for critical missions and assets at alternate sites. This
   could also include sending non-essential personnel home as a means of dispersal.
   3.6.2. Activation and Relocation Phase (0-12 hours). This phase begins when operations at
   the primary facility can no longer support MEF execution. During this phase, give priority to
   military operations (including logistical support), continuing Command, Control,
   Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (C4 ISR) functions,
   transferring personnel and computer data/applications necessary to support operations,
   personnel accountability and damage and residual resource assessment and reporting.
   3.6.3. Alternate Operating Facility Operation Phase. This phase commences with full MEF
   execution with a focus on military operations, communications, transportation, performing
   other essential functions, resource recovery and reconstituting forces. Affected organizations
   should notify command and control agencies of manpower and capability at alternate
20                                   AFI10-208 _AFOTECSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2013


 locations. Refer to AFI 10-206, for reporting requirements. Address the restoration of
 command staffs, capabilities, and functions as resources and operational tasks permit.
 3.6.4. Return to Normal Operations Phase. This phase begins when an appropriate authority
 directs the return to normal operations. During this phase, begin implementing plans to
 resume normal operations. Supervise an orderly return to the normal operating facilities, or
 movement to a temporary or permanent facility. Maintain communication with Command
 and Control (C2) agencies during transition and report mission manpower and capability.

Continuity of Government—A coordinated effort within each Branch of Government ensuring
the capability to continue Branch minimum essential responsibilities in a catastrophic crisis.
Continuity of Government is dependent on effective continuity of operations plans and
capabilities. DOD Continuity of Government activities involve ensuring continuity of DOD MEF
through plans and procedures governing succession to office; emergency delegations of authority
(where permissible, and in accordance with applicable law); the safekeeping of vital resources,
facilities, and records; the improvisation or emergency acquisition of vital resources necessary
for the performance of MEF; and the capability to relocate essential personnel and functions to,
and sustain performance of MEF at, alternate work site(s) until normal operations can be
resumed.
Continuity of Operations (COOP)—An internal effort within individual components of the
Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Branches of Government assuring the capability exists to
continue uninterrupted essential component functions across a wide range of potential
emergencies, including local or regional natural disasters, health-related emergencies, accidents,
and technological and/or attack-related emergencies. COOP involves plans and capabilities
covering the same functional objectives of Continuity of Government, must be maintained at a
high level of readiness, and be capable of implementation both with and without warning. COOP
is not only an integral part of Continuity of Government and Enduring Constitutional
Government (ECG), but is simply "good business practice" - part of the Department of Defense's
fundamental mission as a responsible and reliable public institution.
Crisis—An incident or situation involving a threat to the United States, its territories, citizens,
military forces, possessions, or vital interests that develops rapidly and creates a condition of
such diplomatic, economic, political, or military importance that commitment of U.S. military
forces and resources is contemplated to achieve national objectives.
Critical Infrastructure Program (CIP)—USAF CIP/CARM is a mission assurance, risk
management program. The goal is to assure availability of assets/infrastructure critical to DoD
and AF missions. These include both operational and Title 10 missions and capabilities. The
Program identifies critical assets inside and outside the fence line, mission “impact” caused by
critical asset loss/degradation, and focuses on theater/global impact vs. local impact. It supports
risk management –identifies risk to the asset and impact to the mission.
Defense Continuity Executive Steering Group (Continuity ESG)—Senior representatives
from designated OSD Components, Joint Staff, Military Services, and Defense Agencies that
serve as the "board of directors" for the DCP to provide guidance and oversight for DOD
continuity-related activities, while developing and implementing a DOD-wide continuity strategy
for the twenty-first century threat environment. The Continuity ESG also adjudicates functional
disputes concerning the use of common DOD continuity resources that support the Secretary of
Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Defense Continuity Program (DCP)—An integrated program comprised of defense policies,
plans, procedures, assets, and resources that ensures continuity of DOD Component MEF under
all circumstances, including crisis, attack, recovery, and reconstitution. It encompasses the DOD
Components performing Continuity of Operations, Continuity of Government, and Enduring
Constitutional Government functions across the spectrum of threats to continuity.

Devolution— is the capability to transfer statutory authority and/or responsibility for essential
functions from an agency’s primary operating staff and facilities to other agency employees and
facilities, and to sustain that operational capability for an extended period.
Force Protection (FP)—Members Actions taken to prevent or mitigate hostile actions against
DOD personnel (to include family members), resources, facilities, and critical information.
These actions conserve the force‘s fighting potential so it can be applied at the decisive time and
place and incorporate the coordinated and synchronized offensive and defensive measures to
enable the effective employment of the joint force while degrading opportunities for the enemy.
Force protection does not include actions to defeat the enemy or protect against accidents,
weather, or disease. Also called FP (JP 1-02). Note: The Air Force defines FP as the process of
detecting threats and hazards to the Air Force and its mission, and applying measures to deter,
pre-empt, negate or mitigate them based on an acceptable level of risk.] (AFDD 3-10)
{Italicized definition in brackets applies only to the Air Force and is offered for clarity.}
Emergency Relocation Staff (ERS)—Members directly supporting uninterrupted operational
capability and COOP execution.

matter experts from multiple functions across the installation, including major tenants and
supported units. The IDWG conducts and coordinates the IDRMP and accomplishes tasks for
the IDC. (AFI 31-101)
Mission Essential Functions (MEF)—The specified or implied tasks required to be performed
by, or derived from, statute or Executive order, and those organizational activities that must be
performed under all circumstances to achieve DOD Component missions or responsibilities in a
continuity threat or event. Failure to perform or sustain these functions would significantly
impact DOD ability to provide vital services, or exercise authority, direction, and control.
National Capital Region (NCR)—The geographic area located within the boundaries of the
District of Columbia; Montgomery and Prince Georges Counties in the State of Maryland;
Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun, and Prince William Counties and the Cities of Alexandria, Fairfax,

Reconstitution—The rebuilding of an organization by relocating selected personnel from
subordinate organizations to a designated location to assume the mission essential functions
performed by the higher-level organization.
Reconstitution Site—A location selected by the surviving organization as the site at which a
damaged or destroyed function can be reformed by survivors of the event/emergency and
personnel from other sources, designated as replacements.
Relocation Site—The site selected by an organization that is capable of supporting the logistics
and communications necessary to continue an organization’s mission essential functions.
Vital Records—Records essential to the continued functioning or reconstitution of an
organization during and after an emergency and also those records essential to protecting the
rights and interests of that organization and of the individuals directly affected by its activities.
Sometimes called essential records. Include both emergency-operating and rights-and-interests
records. Vital records considerations are part of an agency’s records disaster prevention and
recovery program.

                 DEVELOPING AF MISSION ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS

Prior to writing continuity plans, organizations should complete a thorough analysis of the
mission and functions of the organization, supporting activities, communications, and vital
records/data necessary for successful mission execution.
A4.1. Identify the Mission Essential Function(s). Mission Essential Functions are derived
from, but not limited to, the following sources: DOD directive or instruction, AF policy
directives or instruction, MAJCOM or locally developed instructions, CCDR plans, i.e. concept
plans (CONPLAN), operational plan (OPLAN), tasks assigned through the Defense Readiness
and Reporting System (DRRS) in support of CCDRs or HAF, any memorandum of
understanding (MOUs) or memorandum of agreements (MOAs) or other agreements, and the
organization’s mission statement. MEFs should provide overarching answers to questions, such
as, what function or service does this organization provide to the Air Force and/or DOD?
A4.1. (AFOTEC)AFOTEC MEF(s) and MEF critical supporting tasks will be validated
using the AFOTEC MEF validation worksheets or a similar validation process. See
AFOTEC-added Attachment 8.
   A4.1.1. Mission Essential Tasks do not readily equate to MEFs. Functions should generally
   describe an activity required to achieve a desired goal, mission or organizational
   responsibility. The responsibility has been designated or delegated by higher authority.
   Tasks usually are more specific and may generally contribute to the performance of a
   function.
   A4.1.2. An example of a MEF may be, “Ensure Air Force forces are continuously available
   to conduct CONUS air superiority.” This function implies a series of tasks, some which may
   not be readily defined in readiness reporting systems. Response times should be derived
   from higher headquarters.
A4.2. Identify interdependencies necessary to support MEF execution. Interdependencies
can be within and/or outside an organization or installation. Additionally, break the MEF into
subordinate elements or tasks necessary to accomplish the function. For example, an
organization may be tasked to launch F-22s to assist in maintaining air superiority. This task
requires aircraft with crews and maintainers, logistics, security and extensive mission support. A
headquarters staff function may need to provide situational awareness and analysis of the data to
a commander in support of decision-making.
   A4.2.1. Identify the subordinate elements or tasks/services necessary to execute the function.
   Some additional supporting elements may include situational awareness, computer and
   information support staff, and administrative management.
   A4.2.2. Identify any service, equipment, leaders and staff, facilities, communication
   capability, data/information, or other supporting infrastructure necessary to perform the
   function. Areas to consider, but not limited to, include: command and control, command
   decisions and strategies, crisis communications (including alerts and notifications), crisis data
   storage, retrieval and security, legal obligations, fiscal and contractual obligations, and
   personnel.
AFI10-208 _AFOTECSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                     39


A4.3. Identify the impact and consequences over time should these functions not be
performed. This should establish the acceptable degree of interruption in the MEF execution
during a crisis.
   A4.3.1. Determine what higher order MEF and/or organization this function supports.
   A4.3.2. Assess the impact and consequences over time if these functions fail.
      A4.3.2.1. Assess the maximum time period a function can be suspended without
      consequences.
      A4.3.2.2. Assess the minimum functional level that must be achieved upon resumption.
      A4.3.2.3. Assess the length of time normal functional levels must be achieved.
      A4.3.2.4. Contact the organizations which the function supports for guidance in
      determining the acceptable degree of interruption. For example, contact Wing Plans
      offices for response requirements outlined in OPLANS. MAJCOMs should provide
      guidance to subordinate organizations on OPLAN response requirements.
A4.4. Prioritize organizational MEFs, based on information above.
   A4.4.1. MEFs – broader set of essential functions – must be continued throughout or
   resumed rapidly after normal activities are disrupted. These enable the Air Force to execute
   vital missions and services, maintain safety, and sustain the industrial/economic base during
   disruption of normal operations. This includes incident management responsibilities.
      A4.4.1.1. Primary MEFs (PMEFs) must directly support the National Essential
      Functions (NEFs), execute before, during and in the aftermath of an emergency and be
      performed continuously or resumed within 12 hours of an event and maintained up to 30
      days after an event or until normal operations can be resumed. PMEFs must be submitted
      and approved by OSD.
      A4.4.1.1.1. MEFs must be performed continuously or resumed within 12 hours of an
      event and maintained up to 30 days after an event or until normal operations can be
      resumed.
   A4.4.2. Business Continuity MEFs – Support activities that should be continued or resumed
   whenever practical after a disruption of normal activities, but can accept a delay or minimal
   operating capability.
A4.5. Identify the connection between the higher headquarters MEF this organization
MEF supports.

                           RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

A5.1. Apply risk management principles to all continuity planning elements. Risk
management identifies, controls and minimizes the impact of uncertain events. This process
supports the overarching Continuity Program Management Cycle by identifying (1) the critical
risks to organizational readiness and (2) the strategies that best mitigate the risks. Commanders
should apply risk management principles to guide decisions about when, where, and how to
invest in resources that eliminate, control or mitigate mission risk. Continuity strategies should
seek to improve resilience to mission disruption by ensuring critical MEFs continue at, or are
recovered to, an acceptable minimum level and within acceptable timeframes.
   A5.1.1. Risk assessments performed through other mission assurance programs, such as the
   Critical Asset Risk Assessment (CARA) may be applied to build a COOP risk assessment.
   A5.1.2. Risk as a function of threats, vulnerabilities and consequences is a permanent
   condition.
   A5.1.3. Reviewing an organization’s risks and risk management programs must consider
   additional factors such as mission/function impact, threat/hazard, and vulnerability
   assessments.
   A5.1.4. Further, cost may also be a factor to consider, because informed decisions about
   acceptable and unacceptable risk levels will ultimately drive the resources expenditures (i.e.,
   money, people, and time) to mitigate risk.
   A5.1.5. Risk can never be fully mitigated; no organization can afford to counter every threat
   to its mission. Successful continuity planning demands an intelligent analysis and
   prioritization of where and when to focus resources and apply funding or other assets.
   A5.1.6. A continuity threat assessment integrates a historical review of past events that have
   affected normal operations (e.g., natural disasters; disruptions of communication, power, and
   other utilities; threats to public safety) with a dynamic analysis of other potential threats,
   such as acts of terrorism (from both foreign and domestic agents) and war.
   A5.1.7. This process supports the overarching Continuity Program Management Cycle by
   identifying (1) the critical risks to organizational readiness and (2) the strategies that best
   mitigate the risks.
   A5.1.8. The recommended risk management cycle is made up of four analytical and
   management phases. The following sections describe the key elements that an organization’s
   analysis team should address in each of the phase.
A5.2. Phase 1 – Risk Assessment. Answer the following three questions: (1) what can go
wrong, (2) what is the likelihood that the undesired event might occur, and (3) what would be the
impact should it occur? Critical steps in this phase include:
   A5.2.1. Prioritize the organizational MEFs. Fundamental to this evaluation is the criteria
   used to measure MEF value or the consequence of loss. Consequences should be evaluated
   as an inability to execute the MEF, consider both short- and long-term impacts as well as
   intended and unintended effects from threats/hazards.
AFI10-208 _AFOTECSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                         41


   A5.2.2. Identify the threat-hazards that can impact delivery of the critical functions. Threat is
   the likelihood that an event or other disruption will occur. This step would include exploring
   potential natural events, intentional man-made events, and unintentional man-made events
   that could adversely affect the ability of the organization to perform MEFs. Natural hazards
   are those where the occurrence is beyond the control of the organization, including
   earthquakes, floods, ice storms, winter weather, and external fires. Intentional man-made
   hazards are also beyond the direct control of the organization and could include events such
   as external sabotage, and terrorism. Unintentional man-made events, such as power outages,
   fires, explosions, equipment failures, or human errors may or may not be within the
   organization control.
   A5.2.3. Assess the Vulnerability. Develop the vulnerability assessment. Vulnerability is the
   likelihood that an event or other disruption would succeed, or that the event will result in the
   expected level of consequence.               To identify vulnerabilities assess existing
   safeguards/countermeasures in place to reduce either the likelihood (e.g., security
   countermeasures) or consequence (e.g., redundant capabilities) of the hazard. Identify
   existing safeguards/countermeasures. Identify the existing safeguards that are in place to
   reduce either the likelihood (e.g., security countermeasures) or consequence (e.g., redundant
   capabilities) of the hazard. Utilize CARA after-action reports, vulnerability assessments or
   IDRMP reports and the impact of other mission assurance plans.
A5.3. Phase 2 – Strategic Goals, Objectives, and Constraints. This phase involves
establishing the scope and structure of the risk-informed decision making process. Critical steps
in this phase include:
   A5.3.1. Understand and define the decision. For this effort, the critical question is: How
   should I invest my limited resources across the four continuity pillars – leadership, staff,
   facilities and communications – to ensure that my organization satisfies its continuity
   requirements?
   A5.3.2. Determine who should be involved. Incorporate those who should be involved in the
   decision-making and those who will be affected by actions resulting from the process. Input
   from higher headquarters and commanders are essential to a sound risk management process.
   A5.3.3. Identify the factors that will influence the decisions. The decision to invest resources
   for meeting continuity requirements is not based on only one factor. Decision makers must
   simultaneously weigh multiple factors, including costs, timelines, and risks.
A5.4. Phase 3 – Evaluation of Alternates. For many events, the current risk may be
considered to be at an acceptable level. For those events where the current level of risk is deemed
to be unacceptable, take risk mitigation action. Critical steps in this phase include:
   A5.4.1. Develop alternate risk management strategies. Engage the appropriate decision-
   makers to determine how the risks for each event can be managed most effectively. These
   alternate strategies should be completely developed and documented by addressing all
   critical factors (e.g., cost, schedule).
   A5.4.2. Assess the risk impact of the proposed strategies. The analysis team should reassess
   the risk of each event based on the implementation of each alternative strategy. This step will
   provide the risk reduction value of each of the alternate strategies.

A5.5. Phase 4 – Management Selection.
   A5.5.1. Once the alternative strategies are fully developed and their risk reduction value has
   been quantified, the process moves to the selection phase. During this phase, decision
   makers choose alternatives for implementation. The alternatives will be evaluated based on
   consideration of all of the previously identified critical factors, including effectiveness (risk
   reduction), efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.
   A5.5.2. Another critical factor that should be considered is the confidence or belief that the
   alternative will achieve the projected level of performance. The effect of many of the
   alternative strategies may be well understood by the organization. For instance, these
   alternatives may have a proven track record of performance within other similar
   organizations, or they may have been extensively studied, as part of another program, such as
   CIP/CARM through a completed CARA.

     AFOTEC MISSION ESSENTIAL FUNCTION VALIDATION WORKSHEETS

Purpose: Comply with DODI 3020.26 and AFI 10-208 MEF selection direction to identify those
organizational activities that must be performed under all circumstances to achieve DoD and
component missions or responsibilities during a continuity threat or event. Failure to perform
these functions would significantly affect the DoD capability to provide vital services or exercise
authority, direction, and control. Supporting tasks to AFOTEC MEFs that do not meet the Table
1 source, criticality assessment and time sensitivity tests, should not be considered a COOP
critical supporting task and therefore should not be considered a “must perform” task under
COOP. If the tasks do not meet the tests in Table 1, they should be considered business
continuity functions and completed based on unit priority and capability to perform (personnel,
equipment, supplies available).
Instructions for completing worksheet:
Organization Column. List organization associated with the MEF critical supporting task.
Task Source Columns. List the applicable source(s) requiring the unit to accomplish the task.
Provide the source(s) under the applicable column headings. If the source comes from one of the
“Task Source” headers, then the task meets the “Source Test.” Place a “Y” under the “Source
Test Met” column. If the source does not come from the one of the “Task Source” headers, then
place an “N” under the “Source Test Met” column. If the task does not meet the Source Test,
then careful consideration should occur before confirming as a Critical Supporting Task to an
AFOTEC MEF.
Requirements Column. Identify requirements to accomplish the task.
Criticality Assessment Test Column. Identify products, operations, and organizations impacted
if the task is not performed. On a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the highest criticality, identify
the impact on AFOTEC ability to perform a MEF.
Time Sensitivity Test Column. Identify how long a task can go without being performed. The
longer a task can go without having a significant effect on AFOTEC accomplishing a MEF, the
less likely it is a critical supporting task. If a task can go greater than 30 days without being
performed and have little impact on AFOTEC being able to accomplish its MEFs, then the task
is probably not a critical supporting task. Place a “Y” in the “Time Sensitive” column if the task
cannot go longer than 24 hours without being performed. Careful thought should occur before
placing a “Y” in the “Time Sensitive” column if the “30 day” column is marked.
Note: Some examples have been placed in the columns to provide examples of what is
expected.

A9.1. (AFOTEC) Purpose. To clearly communicate the requirements for AFOTEC COOP
Plans.
A9.2. (AFOTEC) Situation. AFOTEC is designed with built-in COOP concepts, minimizing
single points of failure and maximizing its capability of performing its MEF(s) under all
circumstances.
   A9.2.1. (AFOTEC) Redundancy/transfer. Providing operational assessment, test and
   evaluation capabilities through planning, executing and reporting activities are the
   cornerstones to AFOTEC performing MEF #1. While each detachment and GSU are grouped
   into specific mission sets and individual operational test program taskings, standardized
   operational test processes and methodologies enable redundancy and/or transfer of
   responsibilities within its force structure.
A9.3. (Added-AFOTEC) AFOTEC COOP Plan Intent. Continuity of operations is most
effective when integrated with other unit programs and plans, including emergency management
plans, anti-terrorism plans, and disease containment plans. Since unit continuity of operations
concepts already exist in these programs/plans, the overall intent for AFOTEC COOP planning is
for organizations to utilize these planning documents together. COOP plans must be
operationally focused and based on how the MEF(s) enable overall AFOTEC capabilities.
COOP plans will focus on critical capabilities directly supporting AFOTEC MEF(s), including
its command and control functions, and how AFOTEC will implement these capabilities during a
COOP event. COOP plans/CONOPS should not duplicate information in other plans, directives,
policies or guidance, but should refer to the information.
A9.4. (AFOTEC) AFOTEC Unit Specific Plan Requirements.
      A9.4.1. (AFOTEC) AFOTEC detachments and GSUs are not required to have formal
      COOP plans in place. However, these organizations can utilize template guidance contained
      in AFOTEC-added Attachment 10 as a checklist to draft a contingency specific COOP plan
      to mitigate mission inhibiting factors and execute a return to normal operations.
      A9.4.2. (AFOTEC) AFOTEC units should address critical unit business continuity
      functions. This may be accomplished through referencing other unit plans or issued
      guidance.
      A9.4.3. (AFOTEC) Local (current base/location) and remote (out of local area) relocation
      sites, if applicable, should be considered in unit contingency COOP plans/planning. If
      AFOTEC’s MEF critical tasks are transferred to other units, then relocation to remote sites
      may not be required.
A9.5. (AFOTEC) Unit MEF supporting capabilities that should be addressed in unit COOP
planning.
      A9.5.1. (AFOTEC) Command and Control (C2). Each unit should address connectivity
      with its subordinate organizations, HQ AFOTEC, and other C2 functions, as applicable.
AFI10-208 _AFOTECSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                        51


   A9.5.2. (AFOTEC) Any critical organize, train, and equip capability that meets the MEF
   impact criteria and time sensitivity tests IAW the AFOTEC MEF validation worksheets in
   AFOTEC-added Attachment 8.
A9.6. (AFOTEC) COOP Plan assumptions.
   A9.6.1. (AFOTEC) Operational command and control is key to COOP. After life-saving
   emergency response actions, connectivity with the AF, HQ AFOTEC and subordinate
   organizations is a unit’s first responsibility during a COOP event.
   A9.6.2. (AFOTEC) Emergency response, force protection, anti-terrorism, force health
   protection are IAW with other unit/installation plans and should not be duplicated in COOP
   plans/planning.
   A9.6.3. (AFOTEC) Alternate facilities/locations should be selected based on their
   capability to support the unit’s critical supporting tasks to the AFOTEC MEF(s). As an
   example, a detachment should consider relocating a test team to another location involved
   with the system under test, (i.e. the infrastructure to support test & evaluation activities are
   already in-place).
   A9.6.4. (AFOTEC) HQ directorates/functionals           are   postured    to   assist   AFOTEC
   detachments and GSUs during a COOP event.
      A9.6.4.1. (AFOTEC) The A-1 Directorate will advise/support developing guidance for
      telecommuting and/or Alternative Work Sites (AWS), as required.
      A9.6.4.2. (AFOTEC) The A-3 Directorate will advise/support assessing impact to test
      operations and developing operations recovery plan, as required.
      A9.6.4.3. (AFOTEC) The A-4/7 Directorate will advise/support acquiring temporary
      facilities and/or equipment, as required.
      A9.6.4.4. (AFOTEC) The A-4/7 Directorate will advise/support on budget, resource
      management and contracts issues, as required.
      A9.6.4.5. (AFOTEC) The A-6 Directorate will advise/support acquiring alternate
      information technology resources and establishing network connectivity, as required.
      A9.6.4.6. (AFOTEC) CVI will advise/support on issues affecting security and classified
      information, as required.

                       AFOTEC COOP PLAN/PLANNING TEMPLATE

Note: COOP Plans will be classified “SECRET” when specific relocation sites are listed. DO
NOT ADD relocation sites to this template on a NIPR computer.
Note: This template is designed for HQ AFOTEC and to be used as a basis for a stand-alone
COOP Plan. AFOTEC detachments and GSUs are not required to have formal COOP plans in
place but at a minimum, should develop Business Continuity Plans. These organizations can
utilize this template as a checklist to draft a contingency specific COOP plan to mitigate mission
inhibiting factors and execute a return to normal operations.

                            ATTACHMENT 11 (Added-AFOTEC)
               AFOTEC COOP PLANNING FOR DISEASE CONTAINMENT

A11.1. (AFOTEC) CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS (COOP).
  A11.1.1. (AFOTEC) General. Ensuring AFOTEC is able to perform its mission essential
  function(s) (MEFs) critical supporting tasks is the number one priority after saving lives.
  MEF continuity of operations actions are different during a Pandemic Influenza and/or
  Infectious Disease (PI&ID) outbreak than a COOP event that affects the infrastructure of an
  organization. During a COOP event, such as a tornado or terrorist bombing attack that
  affects an organization’s infrastructure, the organization will relocate its capability to
  perform mission essential functions (MEFs) to another location conducive to performing the
  MEFs. This may be a location on the same base or a more remote location depending on the
  severity of the damage to the local infrastructure and the threat. During a PI&ID outbreak,
  an organization’s infrastructure is usually not directly impacted. The availability of an
  organization’s personnel is the limiting factor in accomplishing MEFs. All AFOTEC
  organizations will follow their respective host-installation disease containment plans. COOP
  actions will be based on workload and function prioritization, personnel
  availability/management, and disease containment vice infrastructure strategies.
  A11.1.2. (AFOTEC) COOP PI&ID Assumptions.
        A11.1.2.1. (AFOTEC) Influenza Outbreaks. PI outbreak waves will last for 6-12 week
        periods, or longer, and will re-occur for 12-24 months. Expect a 40% absentee rate
        (military, civilian, and contractors) for two weeks during peak periods. Effects of PI&ID
        on family members will also affect the availability and performance of personnel. Use
        two waves as planning baseline, but multiple waves can occur, due to the ability of the
        influenza virus to mutate.
        A11.1.2.2. (AFOTEC) Vaccine. An effective vaccine will not be available for up to six
        months after clinical confirmation of sustained human-to-human transmission.
        Competing health requirements will limit the DoD initial supply of the vaccine and
        antivirals.
        A11.1.2.3. (AFOTEC) Infrastructure. Communication and physical infrastructure will
        be in-place and any reduction in capability will be the result of a lack of personnel
        (absent due to illness or taking care of family) to properly sustain the infrastructure.
        A11.1.2.4. (AFOTEC) Work Force. A properly prepared, educated, trained, and
        equipped work force will more effectively accomplish the unit MEF tasks during a
        PI&ID outbreak.
        A11.1.2.5. (Added-AFOTEC) Legal considerations. All PI&ID outbreak COOP
        actions will be IAW Uniform Code of Military Justice, Office of Personnel Management
        guidelines, and US Code.
     A11.1.3. (Added-AFOTEC) Execution. COOP actions will take place as a response to an
     actual or threat of a disease containment or pandemic influenza outbreak that may
     significantly impact the unit’s ability to perform its MEF critical supporting tasks. This may
     occur in conjunction with an USNORTHCOM PI&ID execution order, AFOTEC leadership
AFI10-208 _AFOTECSUP_I 24 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                    57


  direction, or as deemed necessary by (unit’s name)/CC due to local PI&ID outbreak
  conditions.
     A11.1.3.1. (AFOTEC) COOP Priority of Operations. The first COOP priority is to
     maximize its capability to perform AFOTEC MEF critical supporting tasks. The second
     priority is to accomplish unit critical business continuity functions (BCF), based on unit
     priorities and resources to perform the BCF.
     A11.1.3.2. (AFOTEC) Succession of Command. Order of succession is IAW AFI 51-
     604, Appointment to and Assumption of Command. In the event the Commander (CC) is
     unavailable or incapable of executing responsibilities and/or exercising authorities, the
     order of succession will be to the Vice Commander (CV), Director of Operations, then to
     the most senior military member or individual delegated by the CC.
     A11.1.3.3. (AFOTEC) COOP Mitigation Strategies. COOP mitigation strategies
     during a PI&ID outbreak are the disease containment mitigation strategies in the host-
     installation disease containment plan this plan and annexes: vaccination, education,
     social distancing, staggered and alternate work schedules, minimum-manning strategies,
     telework, alternate work locations, hygiene, and cough etiquette.
        A11.1.3.3.1. (AFOTEC) Relocation or Alternate Work Locations. Alternate work
        locations and geographical dispersion (alternate work sites) for MEF positions, due to
        the regional nature of an outbreak, may provide the best protection of MEF personnel
        and capability to perform. A key consideration prior to making a decision to relocate
        to an alternate geographical site is disease containment.
  A11.1.4. (AFOTEC) COOP PI&ID Specific Tasks.
     A11.1.4.1. (AFOTEC) MEF Critical Supporting Tasks and priority BCFs Redundancy.
     Identify and ensure redundancy exists for MEF critical supporting tasks and priority
     BCFs personnel capabilities to reduce or eliminate single point failures when the expert
     gets sick or is unavailable due to family illness to accomplish the task.
     A11.1.4.2. (AFOTEC) Personnel Situational Awareness. Establish processes and
     procedures to keep workforce informed of PI&ID outbreak situation and expectations of
     MEF and BCF personnel during a PI&ID outbreak.
     A11.1.4.3. (AFOTEC) Telework. Develop telework programs to ensure MEF and BCF
     personnel are properly trained and equipped IAW OPM, AF, AFOTEC, and unit telework
     guidance.
