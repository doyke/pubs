time for the Wing.” and “Once the opening checklist is complete, the SOF will run the Airfield
Inspection Checklist.” Paragraph 4.3.1.3 (Added) changes SOF reporting time to 45 minutes
before the next takeoff during breaks in flying. Paragraph 4.3.10 updates distribution and e-mail
list for SOF daily reports; also updates the responsibilities and duties of the squadrons operation
desk to keep Patriot Excalibur (PEX) up-to-date when there are changes to the flying schedule.
Paragraph 4.5.4 (Added) updates 366 OSS/OSOS responsibilities to include e-mailing a daily
SOF schedule to the SOF e-mail in container; 5.1.6 updates SOF changeover responsibilities
during an emergency to read “At no time during an IFE will there be a SOF changeover. The
oncoming SOF will assist the current SOF until the emergency is terminated.” During inclement
weather days, paragraph 6.2.3 clarifies “SOF reporting time to the ATC tower no later than
(NLT) 2 hours prior to first takeoff with proper crew rest.” Paragraph 6.4.3 states “Tower
personnel will maintain the keys in the Watch Supervisor’s desk. SOFs will perform daily
vehicle inspections IAW the SOF Checklist.”

Paragraph 6.5.3 identifies the requirement for a SOF placed on DNIF status to ensure their AF
IMT 1042, Medical Recommendations For Flying or Special Operational Duty, is annotated
with “May perform SOF duties,” and a copy is delivered to squadron SARMs personnel prior to
performing SOF duties in. Changed all references from CoP to SharePoint

2.2. Ops Sup/Top 3. The Ops Sup can be filled by a squadron commander, operations officer,
assistant operations officer, flight commander, or other individuals deemed qualified by the
squadron commander. Squadrons will obtain the 366th Operations Group Commander’s (366
OG/CC) approval using Attachment 5 (Added), Operations Supervisor Nomination Letter for
all Ops Sups. Once approved, this letter will be filed in the individual’s training record.
       3.2.1. (Added) A SOF is not required for FCF. However, an Ops Sup with
       communications ability with the FCF will be on duty in the squadron or control tower.
       3.2.2. (Added) A SOF is not required for local operations when “reduced flying
       operations” is declared by the 366 OG/CC (≤ 4 aircraft) or when Off-Station operations
       are conducted (i.e. TDYs) unless host station’s AFIs or procedures dictate otherwise.
          3.2.2.1. (Added) If required due to manning issues or other non-standard operations,
          as a last resort squadrons may request SOF operations from the Operations Desk and
          will make a request to 366 OG/CC 7 days in advance, routed through the 366th
          Operations Support Squadron, Scheduling Flight (366 OSS/OSOS) and 366 OG/CC
          via electronic Staff Summary Sheet (eSSS). If circumstances prevent a 7-day
          advance request processing, 366 OG/CC may approve requests verbally. Squadrons
          performing SOF duties from the Operations Desk will use the 366 OG SOF
          Emergency Action Checklist located on the 366 OG/OGV (Wing Standardization and
          Evaluation) SharePoint as their primary reference for SOF actions.

Notes:
1. In order to perform SOF duties at the squadron operations desk, the OG/CC must approve IAW
paragraph 3.2.2.1. of this supplement. This does not apply to the 428th RSAF squadron (refer to
paragraph 8.2.).
2. The OG/CC must declare “reduced flying operations.” See Table 1, note 1, for “reduced flying
operations” definition.
3. The flying period is defined as a portion of the wing flying window where airspace is allocated to an
individual squadron.
4. For the purpose of this regulation, an LFE is defined as ≥10 aircraft participating in the exercise.
5. Only those ANG units with ACC, PACAF, and AETC oversight.
6. Deployed fighter unit(s) will provide a SOF when 366 FW units are not flying.

            4.3.1.1. (Added) SOFs will show NLT 1.5-hour prior to first scheduled takeoff. It is
            the responsibility of the SOF to know the first scheduled takeoff time for the Wing.
            On the second flying day of the calendar month, opening SOF will go to 366 FW/CP
            (Command Post) to pick up the SOF land mobile radio (LMR). At the tower, SOF
            will run the opening SOF checklist, check the schedule and call 366 FW/CP to
            receive a daily briefing. After contacting 366 FW/CP, SOF will call 366 OSS/OSAA
            (Airfield Management) to receive a daily briefing. SOF will then call 366 OSS/OSW
            (Weather Flight) to receive a complete weather briefing. SOF will sign off the Flight
            Crew Information File (FCIF) and SOF Read File prior to assuming duties. SOF
AFI11-418_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP 4 JUNE 2012                                                      5


        Read Files are created and maintained by 366 OG/OGV. Once the opening checklist
        is complete, the SOF will run the Airfield Inspection Checklist. At least 30 minutes
        prior to the start of their respective shift, replacement SOFs will call the current SOF
        to find out if the position needs anything (e.g., publications, FCIFs, LMR battery,
        etc.) or if they need to investigate anything prior to proceeding up to the SOF
        position. Upon arrival for their respective shift, replacement SOF will receive a
        changeover briefing from preceding SOF.
        4.3.1.2. (Added) If a SOF is required IAW AFI 11-418, Table 1 and the Mountain
        Home AFB Sup, Table 2, the Tower Watch Supervisor will not allow takeoffs until a
        SOF is present in the tower. If a SOF is not on duty when required, Tower Watch
        Supervisor will follow the guidance in the SOF/ATC Coordination Operations Letter.
        4.3.1.3. (Added) The primary SOF operating location is the control tower. If there
        is a break in local flying, SOF may leave the tower, but must return NLT 45 minutes
        prior to next takeoff. SOF will brief 366 OG/CC (or designated representative) on the
        flying schedule and the SOF’s intention to assume standby status. During this time,
        SOF will report standby status and have communications contact with 366 FW/CP or
        tower via portable radio. SOF will obtain weather and Notice to Airman (NOTAM)
        updates prior to the next takeoff. If a SOF changeover occurs during break, the
        preceding SOF will coordinate show time and changeover brief with incoming SOF.
     4.3.7. Designate a divert field when an alternate is not required during flying operations.
     Boise is the primary divert and is assumed if no other information is distributed. If a
     divert other than Boise is designated, SOF will ensure, through Tower Watch Supervisor,
     the information is included on the Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS), and
     made available to 366 FW/CP and Radar Approach Control (RAPCON).
     4.3.9. Coordinate with Tower Watch Supervisor if a change is made to the current divert
     or alternate field to transmit the change on the guard and tower frequency. After 5
     minutes, tower will transmit change again on guard and tower frequency. The SOF,
     through Tower Watch Supervisor, will ensure ATIS is updated and that RAPCON and
     366 FW/CP are notified. Flight leads will acknowledge change, and SOF will keep track
     of acknowledgements. After 10 minutes from initial announcement, SOF will report to
     squadron Operations Sups which flights have not responded to the change. It is
     imperative that squadron Operations Sups know the plans of their flights when forecasted
     weather could lead to changes. Depending on weather, construction, airspace being used,
     etc., SOF should also consider Hill AFB, NAS Fallon, Klamath Falls, Fairchild AFB,
     Great Falls, and Nellis AFB as diverts or alternates. Twin Falls may be used as a divert
     during day visual flight rules (VFR), but should not be used as an alternate. Limiting
     factors include runway length, no RAPCON service, limited fire protection, limited ramp
     space and runway stress factors.
     4.3.10. SOFs will use Attachment 6 (Added), SOF Daily Report, to log all significant
     events and provide sufficient detail to permit follow-up staff action. SOF report is
     located on the C-drive of SOF computer in the tower and on the 366 OG/OGV
     SharePoint. Opening SOF will open the document and fill out all applicable areas and
     significant events electronically. At SOF changeover, close the electronic SOF Tour
     Report and save under the current date, and the incoming SOF will reopen and continue
6                                  AFI11-418_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP 4 JUNE 2012


    to log all significant events as before. Closing SOF will e-mail the final tour report to the
    366 OG/SOF Reports distro list (owned and maintained by 366 OGV). There is a
    hyperlink on the top line of the SOF report that will automatically bring up an e-mail
    message with the correct e-mail addresses when clicked. SOF will use the PEX schedule
    to maintain accountability of aircraft. SOF will input land and takeoff times IAW the
    SOF checklist. The individual squadrons Operations Desk will input each flights flight
    plan into PEX NLT crew step time and inform Base Ops when PEX is accurate and
    complete. Additionally, the squadrons Operations Desk will make changes to aircrew/tail
    numbers/call signs and ensure PEX is updated to include changes to and deviations from
    the daily flying schedule. If the SOF identifies a discrepancy, they will contact that
    squadron. Every closing SOF will check and recharge the LMR battery and run the
    closing SOF checklist. The first flying day of the month, closing SOF will drop off the
    SOF LMR to 366 FW/CP for a maintenance check. In the event of a computer
    malfunction, complete SOF reports by hand and bring to 366 FW/CP. 366 FW/CP will
    fax the handwritten tour report to 366 OG/OGV. 366 OG/OGV will review SOF tour
    reports and filed for 1-year in 366 OG/OGV records.
    4.3.12. (Added) The SOF will verify that the 428th Fighter Squadron (428 FS) Net
    Time Reference (NTR) or the 726th Air Control Squadron (726 ACS) transmitter is
    operational.     Per the 366th Operations Group Instruction (366 OGI) 10-1,
    Airspace/Range Scheduling, if they are nonoperational, SOF will look at the wing flying
    schedule and choose the most logical flight to pick up NTR. Contact that flight lead via
    squadron operations or SOF frequency, and request them to pick up NTR (give
    consideration to flight profile and where the flight is going). Then call squadron Ops
    Sups and notify them which flight has NTR. SOF will monitor the flight with the NTR
    and hand off to the next logical flight accordingly.
    4.5.4. (Added) The 366 OSS/OSOS will develop a SOF duty schedule. Coordinate
    changes to SOF schedule through individual units and 366 OSS/OSOS. 366 OSS/OSOS
    will e-mail a daily SOF schedule to the 366 OG/SOF e-mail container.
    5.1.1. When in the tower, SOF will monitor a dedicated SOF UHF and VHF (reference
    366 FW In-Flight Guide for frequencies). Refer to MHAFBI 11-250, Airfield Operations
    and Base Flying Procedures, and Operations Letter, Subject, "Supervisor of Flying
    (SOF)/Air Traffic Control (ATC) Coordination," for expanded command and control
    procedures during aircraft emergencies.
    5.1.6. At no time during an IFE will there be a SOF changeover. The oncoming SOF
    will assist the current SOF until the emergency is terminated.
    5.1.8. The SOF has overall coordination control of all aircraft emergencies. If the SOF is
    not qualified in the emergency aircraft type and requires additional assistance (i.e. F-15E
    SOF handling and F-15SG aircraft emergency), he/she can use the Flying Squadron Ops
    Sup as an additional resource. Aircrew must not use their squadron Ops Sup as primary
    coordinators for emergencies.
    6.2.3. During winter weather months, opening SOFs will check the weather the day prior
    to their shift. If snow/ice is forecast, opening SOF will have 12 hours of crew rest for a
    report time at Base Operations of 2.5 hours prior to first takeoff for the following day.
    When snow/ice is forecast or is present, SOF will arrive at Base Operations to receive a
AFI11-418_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP 4 JUNE 2012                                                     7


     weather and 366 OSS/OSAA operations brief. The SOF is in charge of setting the
     priorities for the parking ramp snow removal. Squadron Ops Sups should not step their
     crews until checking the airfield status with SOF. When inclement weather is in the
     forecast (rain, low ceilings, high winds, etc.), which could affect airfield operations,
     opening SOF will report to 366 FW ATC Tower NLT 2 hours prior to first takeoff with
     proper crew rest. SOF will use the extra time to check airfield status and assist 366
     OSS/OSAA in prioritizing inclement weather operations (snow removal, de-icing,
     Runway Condition Reading (RCR), etc.). All other days, opening SOF will report to the
     SOF position NLT 1.5-hour prior to first scheduled takeoff.
     6.4.3. Keep the SOF vehicle at the control tower. Tower personnel will maintain the keys
     in the Watch Supervisor’s desk. SOFs will perform daily vehicle inspections IAW the
     SOF Checklist.
     6.4.7. The SOF kit is located in the control tower and maintained by 366 OG/OGV. The
     SOF kit is capable of being moved to a secondary location (the on duty SOF will ensure
     the required items referenced in this paragraph, are gathered from the SOF position and
     placed into the SOF kit prior to relocating to a secondary location). As a minimum, SOF
     kit will consist of assigned aircraft flight manual checklist (-1 CL); flight manual (-1);
     366 FW In-Flight Guide; AFI 11-418 and the MHAFB Supplement; squadron aircrew aid
     (if applicable); flashlight; SOF emergency action checklists; and applicable flight
     information publications (FLIP). SOF minimum FLIP requirements are: IFR
     Supplement; Flight Information Handbook; H1/H3 and H2/H4 IFR Enroute High
     Altitude chart; Northwest and Southwest High Altitude Instrument Approach Procedures
     books; Volume 2, Low Altitude Instrument Approach Procedures book; Salt Lake City
     Sectional Aeronautical Chart; and Area Planning 1B. Maintain Terminal Change Notices
     (TCN), as applicable. Maintain the FCIF part IB and SOF Read File in the control tower.
        6.5.1.2. (Added) The minimum qualification required for initial SOF nominees will
        be an experienced 4-ship flight lead or an experienced weapons system officer (WSO)
        as defined in AFI 11-2MDS, Volume 1, Aircrew Training. A pilot or WSO, with 366
        OG/CC approval, may have these requirements waived. A pilot who is a previously
        qualified SOF does not need to be a 4-ship flight lead to be re-qualified as a SOF, but
        must have flown in the local area for at least 3 months. Squadron commanders
        nominate qualified individuals, but the OG/CC has the ultimate responsibility in
        determining an individual’s readiness to assume SOF responsibilities.
     6.5.3. SOFs who are placed on DNIF status will, if applicable, ensure their AF Form
     1042 is annotated with “May perform SOF duties.” and will ensure SARMs personnel
     have a copy of this form on file prior to performing duties.
     6.6.2. Squadron commanders will submit nominations for SOF using Attachment 7
     (Added), SOF Nomination Letter. Once entered into SOF upgrade, document training on
     Attachment 8 (Added), USAF SOF Certification and Training Letter, and Attachment
     9 (Added), 428 FS SOF Certification and Training Letter. All of these letters are located
     on the 366 OG/OGV SharePoint in a digital format. Squadrons will maintain the
     nomination and completed certification letter in the individual’s training record.
     6.6.6. Accomplish upgrade tours with an Instructor SOF. To qualify as an Instructor
     SOF, a SOF must have at least 6 months SOF experience at Mountain Home AFB
8                                    AFI11-418_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP 4 JUNE 2012


       (MHAFB). Squadron commanders will nominate qualified individuals to 366 OG/CC
       using Attachment 10 (Added), Instructor Supervisor of Flying Nomination Letter. A
       digital copy is located on the 366 OG/OGV SharePoint. Squadrons will maintain the
       signed nomination letter in the individual’s training record. Instructor SOFs are
       designated on the Letter of Xs.
       6.6.7. Previously certified SOFs are required to accomplish items noted in (Attachments
       8 (Added) and 9 (Added)).
