This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 32-70, Environmental Quality, July 1994;
AFPD 23-2, Supplies and Materiel Management; June 1993; AFPD 90-8, Environment, Safety, and Occu-
pational Health, January 1999; AFPD 90-9, Operational Risk Management; and AFPD 91-3, Occupa-
tional Safety and Health, September 1993. It establishes procedures and standards that govern
management of hazardous materials (HAZMAT) throughout the Air Force. It applies to all Air Force per-
sonnel (at classified and unclassified operations) who authorize, procure, issue, use, or dispose of
HAZMAT in the course of their official duties; and to those who manage, monitor, or track any of the pre-
ceding processes, whether the processes are performed by government or contractor personnel. This Air
Force Instruction (AFI) is applicable to all installations, except where international agreements require
modified policy. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are
maintained in accordance with AFPD 37-1, Air Force Information Management, and Air Force Manual
(AFMAN) 37-123, Management of Records, and the associated Air Force Records Disposition Schedule.
Send comments and suggested improvements on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publi-
cation, through channels, to Headquarters United States Air Force (HQ USAF), Deputy Chief of Staff for
Installations and Logistics, Environmental Division (HQ USAF/ILEV), 1260 Air Force Pentagon, Wash-
ington DC 20330-1260. Major Commands (MAJCOMs) are required to supplement this instruction
within 12 months of issuance. In addition, other organizations may supplement this instruction. MAJ-
COM, the Air National Guard (ANG), Field Operating Agency (FOA), and Direct Reporting Unit (DRU)
Environmental, Safety, and Occupational Health Committee (ESOHC) chairs can submit to HQ USAF/
CVA a request for a waiver to the assignment of specific responsibilities in this AFI. Waiver requests must

clearly identify the specific changes to responsibility assignments and provide the rationale for deviating
from the standardized Air Force structure as defined in this AFI. The HQ USAF ESOHC Co-Chairs have
final approval authority for these waiver requests. This instruction is consistent with Air Force Occupa-
tional Safety and Health (AFOSH) standards. It prescribes AF Form 3952, Chemical/Hazardous Mate-
rial Request/Authorization and AF Form 3953, Contract Class I Ozone Depleting Substance (ODS)
Senior Acquisition Official (SAO) Approval Application Form. See Attachment 1 for a list of refer-
ences and supporting information.

(AFMC) AFI 32-7086, 1 November 2004, is supplemented as follows:
(AFMC) This supplement does not apply to the Air National Guard or US Air Force Reserve units and
members. This supplement applies to all Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) installations and tenants
located or doing business on an AFMC installation. It expands on the guidance provided in the AFI and
assigns responsibilities consistent with the AFMC infrastructure to ensure all AFI requirements are met.
Any AFMC installation may supplement this instruction.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.
This revision updates and replaces AFI 32-7086, Hazardous Material Management, 1 Aug 97, in its
entirety. This revised AFI includes updates of many of the roles and responsibilities for HAZMAT and
ODS management (Chapter 1 and Chapter 2), replaces the HAZMAT Pharmacy terminology with the
installation HAZMAT management program (Chapter 2), and revises the HAZMAT and ODS authoriza-
tion and tracking requirements (Chapter 2, Chapter 3 and Chapter 4).
(AFMC) This supplement updates AFMC requirements to reflect changes in AFI 32-7086, 1 November
04 revision.

       AIR FORCE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS (HAZMAT) MANAGEMENT PROCESS

Section 1A—HAZMAT Management Process (HMMP) Purpose and Objectives

1.1. HMMP Purpose. The HMMP includes the activities and infrastructure required for ongoing identi-
fication, management, tracking, and minimization of HAZMAT. The purpose of the HMMP is to manage
the procurement and use of HAZMAT to: (1) support Air Force missions; (2) to protect the safety and
health of personnel on Air Force installations and communities surrounding Air Force installations by
ensuring proper management of HAZMAT; (3) to minimize Air Force use of HAZMAT consistent with
mission requirements; (4) and to maintain Air Force compliance with environmental requirements for
HAZMAT usage.

1.2. HMMP Objectives.
    1.2.1. The HMMP supports accomplishment of the Air Force mission by minimizing and effectively
    managing dependence on HAZMAT within acceptable levels of mission and ESOH risk, while reduc-
    ing associated Total Ownership Cost (TOC).
    1.2.2. The specific objectives of the HMMP are to:
       1.2.2.1. Collect and maintain HAZMAT data on the standardized Air Force HAZMAT tracking
       system.
       1.2.2.2. Protect the safety and health of personnel on Air Force installations and communities sur-
       rounding Air Force installations from Air Force misuse of HAZMAT.
       1.2.2.3. Integrate weapon system HAZMAT reduction needs into the weapon system require-
       ments generation, prioritization, funding, and execution processes.
       1.2.2.4. Manage mission critical requirements for Class I Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS).
       1.2.2.5. Provide the work area supervisor with information necessary to comply with applicable
       hazardous material risk communication requirements, especially the Occupational Safety and
       Health Administration (OSHA) Hazard Communication (HAZCOM) Standard.
       1.2.2.6. Comply with applicable hazardous material management laws, regulations and Executive
       Orders (EOs), especially EO 13148, Greening the Government Through Leadership in Environ-
       mental Management, 26 April 2000, which requires federal agencies to comply with Emergency
       Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), the initial catalyst for the creation of the
       HMMP.
       1.2.2.7. Minimize the generation of hazardous waste (HW).

Section 1B—HMMP Structure

1.3. HAZMAT Definition. For purposes of this AFI, the term HAZMAT includes all items (including
medical supply items, but excluding drugs in their finished form and pharmaceuticals in individu-
ally-issued items) covered under EPCRA (or other host nation, federal, state, or local) tracking require-
AFI32-7086_AFMCSUP1_I 10 APRIL 2006                                                                      7


ment, the OSHA HAZCOM Standard, and all Class I and Class II ODS. It does not include munitions or
HW.

1.4. HMMP Team. This AFI assigns specific functional area responsibilities for HMMP execution at all
levels. The key to effective HAZMAT management is cross-functional cooperation achieved through the
establishment of HMMP teams at all levels.
   1.4.1. HMMP Team Chain of Command. At each level (HQ USAF, MAJCOM, and installation), the
   Environmental Protection Committee (EPC) or Environmental, Safety, and Occupational Health
   Committee (ESOHC) chair will establish, via formal charter, a cross-functional HMMP team. (See
   Attachment 4 for an example charter.) Civil Engineer (CE) will lead the HMMP team. The team will
   report to the EPC or ESOHC chair. Individual team members are also responsible for reporting to their
   functional chain of command on HMMP issues.
       1.4.1.1. (Added-AFMC) The HQAFMC HMMP Team is chartered by the ESOH IPT.
   1.4.2. HMMP Team Composition. The HMMP team will include, but is not limited to, representa-
   tives from CE (representing environmental and fire protection), Surgeon General (SG) (Bioenviron-
   mental Engineering or BE), Safety (SE), Communications and Information (SC or CS), Legal (JA),
   Maintenance, Logistics Readiness (with supply expertise), Contracting, and HAZMART supervisors.
   Other functional areas such as Finance, Requirements, Plans, Manpower, Public Affairs, HAZMAT
   users, and tenant organizations are also members of the HMMP team, as required. Contracted func-
   tions may have contractor representation on the HMMP team. The team charter will specifically iden-
   tify HMMP team members.
       1.4.2.1. (Added-AFMC) HMMP Team Composition. The HMMP team will also include Air
       Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) representation, as required.
   1.4.3. HMMP Team Functions. The HMMP team, at all levels, will:
       1.4.3.1. Provide oversight for the three major areas covered in the HMMP: the Installation
       HAZMAT Management Program (IHMP), the Weapon System HAZMAT Program (WSHP), and
       the ODS Program (ODSP).
       1.4.3.2. Identify and resolve issues, particularly in policy and resource guidance; cross feed smart
       procedures; evaluate performance; incorporate HAZMAT management initiatives into existing
       procedures; and validate and prioritize strategies that support and enhance HAZMAT manage-
       ment.
       1.4.3.3. Communicate policy goals and objectives and develop efficient HAZMAT management
       plans.
       1.4.3.4. Provide the necessary teamwork, oversight, coordination, and cross feed to develop and
       sustain the standardized Air Force HAZMAT tracking system and associated interfaces.
       1.4.3.5. Regularly schedule and hold meetings at least quarterly to address HMMP issues with
       suggested topics of discussion as follows:
              Resource (funding and personnel) review, validation, and tracking
              Support Agreements
              Metrics
              Contract HAZMAT requirements

               IHMP issues
               WSHP issues
               ODSP issues
               Customer feedback
       1.4.3.6. HAZMART supervisors, and HMMP team members should use the Air Force Institute of
       Technology (AFIT) HMMP Course as the primary source of HMMP management and
       HAZMART operations training. Also, HMMP team members should be familiar with both the
       standardized Air Force HAZMAT tracking system and the Environmental Compliance Assess-
       ment and Management Program (ECAMP)/Environmental, Safety, and Occupational Health
       (ESOH) CAMP HMMP protocols.
    1.4.4. HMMP Team Problem Resolution Process. The HMMP team chain of command (paragraph
    1.4.1.) is structured to ensure senior leadership insight into the HMMP and involvement in resolving
    HMMP issues that the team has not been able to resolve.
       1.4.4.1. The HMMP team is responsible for first trying to resolve issues within the team itself.
       1.4.4.2. If this is not possible, the HMMP team has the responsibility to go to the ESOHC chair
       for assistance. Individual team members have to first inform their chain of command before the
       HMMP team presents the issue to the ESOHC chair.
       1.4.4.3. If the ESOHC chair cannot resolve the issue, the HMMP team, with the approval of the
       ESOHC chair, should refer the issue to the HMMP team at the next level of command.

1.5. HMMP Programs. The HMMP consists of three major programs: the IHMP, WSHP, and the ODSP.
The WSHP and the ODSP are dependent on the IHMP for data collection and allocation control, respec-
tively. In addition, it is essential that each HMMP team establish a management effort to ensure the accu-
racy and reliability of the HAZMAT data in the standardized Air Force HAZMAT tracking system.
    1.5.1. IHMP. Chapter 2 describes the IHMP requirements for authorizing, procuring, issuing, and
    tracking HAZMAT at Air Force installations. The IHMP provides the necessary data and controls to
    support the WSHP and ODSP.
    1.5.2. WSHP. Chapter 3 describes the WSHP requirements to link HAZMAT reduction efforts to
    installation and MAJCOM priorities. The WSHP relies on IHMP data to link HAZMAT usage to
    weapon systems.
    1.5.3. ODSP. Chapter 4 describes the requirements for managing ODS. The ODSP relies on the
    IHMP to control the allocation of mission-critical supplies of ODS.
    1.5.4. Data Quality Management Effort. Each HMMP team must implement a management effort to
    provide for the quality assurance of the HAZMAT data upon which the effectiveness and efficiency of
    the HMMP depend. Each management effort should provide for continuous improvement of the
    HMMP through the quality Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle. Key elements of the HMMP quality manage-
    ment effort may include continuity folders with documented operating instructions, required training
    of new HMMP team members and HMMP customers, inclusion of HMMP activities in the ECAMP
    and ESOHCAMP reviews, installation HMMP team visits to customer work areas, and formal
    cross-feed of lessons learned.

                                              Chapter 2

               INSTALLATION HAZMAT MANAGEMENT PROGRAM (IHMP)

Section 2A—IHMP Purpose and Objectives

2.1. IHMP Purpose. The purpose of the IHMP is to provide Air Force installations with a standard way
to manage HAZMAT procurement and use and to comply with ESOH requirements. NOTE: Although the
primary focus is on HAZMAT, the broader purpose is to protect the environment, safety and health of
potentially affected DOD or Air Force workers and communities.
   2.1.1. The IHMP provides for process-based authorizing, procuring, issuing, and tracking of
   HAZMAT. It is a repository for data required for meeting HAZMAT reporting requirements, tracking
   the locations of HAZMAT on an installation, assessing Air Force processes for pollution prevention
   opportunities, and measuring success in minimizing HAZMAT use.
   2.1.2. The IHMP ensures HAZMAT users obtain the material required to perform their Air Force
   mission. However, the IHMP will only issue HAZMAT to users that understand and have imple-
   mented appropriate ESOH precautions.
   2.1.3. The IHMP ensures the purchase and use of only the smallest quantities of HAZMAT necessary
   to accomplish the mission. The IHMP accomplishes this by eliminating HAZMAT usage not essential
   to mission accomplishment, substituting reduced-risk HAZMAT whenever possible, and minimizing
   HAZMAT usage when the mission dictates their use. Decision-making on minimization and substitu-
   tion should take into account reducing overall TOC inclusive of ESOH costs within acceptable levels
   of risks. NOTE: Only the SM that controls a technical order (TO) may make a change to it or to any
   HAZMAT requirements identified in the TO

2.2. IHMP Objectives. In addition to the HMMP objectives in paragraph 1.2.,the IHMP will.
   2.2.1. Support accomplishment of Air Force missions while minimizing HAZMAT usage.
   2.2.2. Focus efforts to improve process efficiencies in order to reduce TOC.
   2.2.3. Provide standardized HAZMAT service to the customer.
   2.2.4. Purchase, store, and issue HAZMAT in smallest quantities required to support mission require-
   ments.
   2.2.5. Ensure HAZMAT issue and use conform to appropriate ESOH requirements.
   2.2.6. Track HAZMAT by process, facility location and where applicable, weapon system, and TO or
   manual.
   2.2.7. Enter all required HAZMAT data into the standardized Air Force HAZMAT tracking system.
   2.2.8. Provide HAZMAT data to support Air Force requirements.

Section 2B—IHMP Structure

2.3. IHMP Elements. The standard Air Force IHMP will function as a partially decentralized operation.
The EPC or ESOHC chair will use the HMMP team (as described in paragraph 1.4.) to provide oversight
and coordination of the IHMP. The standard Air Force IHMP consists of the following:
     2.3.1. HAZMART. As “customer service desk” for the IHMP, the HAZMART is the only entity on an
     installation authorized to issue government-owned HAZMAT, and is the only approved source for
     Class I ODS. At a minimum, a HAZMART is a facility or location where customers can receive sup-
     port for obtaining HAZMAT, and where HAZMAT are managed and tracked. Each installation must
     have at least one primary HAZMART established by, and accountable to, the Logistics Readiness
     Squadron (LRS) commander. However, those installations, such as Geographically Separated Units,
     that have IHMP support from another location do not require a HAZMART.
        2.3.1.1. (Added-AFMC) The HAZMART does not have to serve as a receiving or storage loca-
        tion for hazardous materials, prior to delivery to the customer. The HAZMART should not pre-
        clude the use of "just-in-time" delivery of hazardous materials.
     2.3.2. The Standardized Air Force HAZMAT Tracking System. The HMMP team will use the stan-
     dardized Air Force HAZMAT tracking system to support reporting requirements and to manage
     HAZMAT, including War Reserve Materiel (WRM) IAW 2.6.1.7., at the installation. The HMMP
     team will provide appropriate user access to the tracking system. Bar coding, or an alternative practice
     selected by the HMMP team through the process described in 2.10.1.8., will be included in the busi-
     ness practices supporting this tracking system.
     2.3.3. HAZMAT Determination and Authorization Process. This process, described in 2.5., estab-
     lishes the standardized procedures for identifying which hazardous materials will be included in the
     IHMP. It also establishes the standardized procedures for requesting and authorizing HAZMAT and
     for approving and tracking contractor usage of HAZMAT.
     2.3.4. HAZMAT Data Quality Management Procedures. In addition to individual functional area
     responsibilities, each installation HMMP team must ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data in
     the standardized Air Force HAZMAT tracking system. To this end, the installation team must estab-
     lish and implement procedures to confirm that HMMP team members are fulfilling their roles and
     responsibilities as defined in this AFI.

2.4. HAZMART Functions. All installation HAZMARTs (whether contractor or government operated)
must:
     2.4.1. Manage the receipt, storage, issue, inspection, and distribution of HAZMAT.
     2.4.2. Immediately forward to the HMMP team information on any requested material that is not cur-
     rently loaded in the standardized Air Force HAZMAT tracking system and is potentially hazardous.
     The HMMP team will determine whether the material meets the HAZMAT definition in paragraph
     1.3.
     2.4.3. Review submitted AF Form 3952 information and supporting materials for accuracy and com-
     pleteness.
     2.4.4. Ensure that all requests for HAZMAT have prior authorization according to paragraph 2.5.
     before issue.
AFI32-7086_AFMCSUP1_I 10 APRIL 2006                                                                    19


   2.4.5. Enter HAZMAT transactions into the standardized Air Force HAZMAT tracking system.
      2.4.5.1. This includes, but is not limited to, Government-wide Purchase Card (GPC), contractor
      purchased/used, contracting purchased transactions, and supply system transactions.
      2.4.5.2. It is the responsibility of contractors and GPC holders to report HAZMAT purchases and
      use to the HAZMART. Appropriate penalties for the contractor, or administrative and disciplinary
      action for the latter should be established.
   2.4.6. Minimize HAZMAT usage or waste by reusing/redistributing excess HAZMAT on base to
   other Air Force bases, or through the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO) Reutiliza-
   tion, Transfer, Donation, and Sales (RTDS) program. Before ordering or purchasing HAZMAT, deter-
   mine if it is possible to obtain the HAZMAT from the installation free-issue, reuse, and redistribution
   program, as the preferred HAZMAT source.
   2.4.7. Work with customers and suppliers to ensure they purchase HAZMATs in practical quantities
   to minimize waste, handling, and storage costs.
   2.4.8. Use the Class I ODS Requisition SAO Approval process described in paragraph 4.6. to requi-
   sition Class I ODS.
   2.4.9. Use bar coding, or an HMMP team-approved alternative procedure, on all materials deter-
   mined to be HAZMAT, IAW paragraph 2.5.
   2.4.10. Perform quality control functions to properly identify items as possible HAZMATs to prevent
   inadvertent procurement or issue transactions for unauthorized materials. Immediately notify the
   HMMP team of any suspected or potential HAZMAT that has not been properly coded as a HAZMAT.
   2.4.11. Work with the Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) monitor or the Time Change mon-
   itor to ensure all HAZMAT contained in TCTO kits is properly identified and controlled.
   2.4.12. Maintain and update the HAZMART-specific and supply-specific HAZMAT data fields in the
   standardized Air Force HAZMAT tracking system as required in the Users Manual or On-Line Help.
   2.4.13. Assist users in identifying HAZMAT stock numbers and/or part numbers, and finding appro-
   priate MSDS.
   2.4.14. Submit required changes for the standardized Air Force HAZMAT tracking system to the
   HMMP team for review and possible validation.
   2.4.15. Ensure copies of MSDSs not available in the existing MSDS inventory are forwarded to either
   the installation SG OPR for MSDS management or directly to the central Air Force MSDS focal point
   (see paragraph 2.11.2.).

2.5. HAZMAT Determination and Authorization Process.
   2.5.1. No one may bring a HAZMAT onto an installation, or use a HAZMAT on an installation until
   they receive all required authorizations via the process described in this section. The IHMP will only
   track items determined to be a HAZMAT via this process. NOTE: Government organizations and
   contractors have different procedures for obtaining authorization for HAZMAT use (contractors see
   paragraph 2.5.5.). In addition, HAZMARTs do not require authorizations to perform the HAZMART
   supply functions of ordering, receiving, stocking, and storing HAZMAT (Also see paragraph 4.4.3.1.).
20                                                        AFI32-7086_AFMCSUP1_I 10 APRIL 2006


     2.5.2. AF Form 3952, Chemical/Hazardous Material Request Authorization. The AF Form 3952
     establishes the standardized data required to request and authorize HAZMAT. Throughout this AFI,
     the term "AF Form 3952" refers to either the hard copy of the AF Form 3952 or the standardized Air
     Force HAZMAT tracking system authorization data entry screens. The electronic data entry screens
     may or may not appear similar to the hard copy of the AF Form 3952. However, the standardized Air
     Force HAZMAT tracking system must be able to produce a hard copy of the AF Form 3952 IAW the
     AF Form 3952 authorization data requirements detailed at Attachment 2.
     2.5.3. General Determination and Authorization Procedures.
        2.5.3.1. Work area supervisors shall use an AF Form 3952, as described in paragraph 2.5.2. to ini-
        tiate a request for HAZMAT, and submit it to the HAZMART (or local HMMP team specified
        workflow). This form is used for the first time use of a HAZMAT in a Work Area; for the renewal
        of an AF Form 3952 authorization that is expiring; to submit revisions to an existing AF Form
        3952 because of changes to the requiring document, procedures, HAZMAT, draw amount or draw
        frequency; and for use of the HAZMAT in a different process. (Block #1 of Figure 2.1.)
            2.5.3.1.1. Work area supervisors should first check the standardized Air Force HAZMAT
            tracking system or consult with the HAZMART to see if the item is already loaded into the
            standardized Air Force HAZMAT tracking system and if it is blanket authorized by all three
            AF Form 3952 Authorizing Offices (CE, SE, and BE).
            2.5.3.1.2. For any requested material that is not currently loaded in the standardized Air Force
            HAZMAT tracking system, the HMMP team will determine whether it meets the HAZMAT
            definition in paragraph 1.3. If the HMMP team determines that the material does not meet the
            HAZMAT definition, the work area supervisor does not need an AF Form 3952 authorization
            to obtain the material. If the HMMP determines that the material does meet the HAZMAT def-
            inition, the HAZMART will load the material information into the standardized Air Force
            HAZMAT tracking system.
            2.5.3.1.3. For a material that is loaded in the standardized Air Force HAZMAT tracking sys-
            tem and has blanket authorizations from all three AF Form 3952 Authorizing Offices, the
            supervisor only has to complete sections I, II, and VI on the AF Form 3952, and does not need
            to obtain separate CE, SE, and BE authorization. (Blocks #2, #3, and #4 of Figure 2.1.).
            2.5.3.1.4. For HAZMAT that requires a process-specific authorization by one or more of the
            Authorizing Offices, the work area supervisors must provide a copy of the one or more docu-
            ments that require the use of the requested HAZMAT in the work area process where the
            supervisors intend to use the requested HAZMAT. The requiring document will be a TO,
            owner/operator manual, work specification, or drawing (Part I, Section III of the AF Form
            3952). Provide a copy of the requiring document or pertinent page for first time requests. For
            TOs, provide the TO number, figure, index, relevant paragraph, page, change number, and
            change date. For other requiring documents, provide the equivalent information. (Block #5
            and #9 of Figure 2.1.)
            2.5.3.1.5. In the absence of a requiring document, the AF Form 3952 Authorizing Offices
            (CE, SE, and BE), operating on behalf of the HMMP team, will require the use of the least
            hazardous available material. The HAZMART will assist the requestor and the Authorizing
            Offices to assess the availability of alternative materials. NOTE: This does not apply when the
AFI32-7086_AFMCSUP1_I 10 APRIL 2006                                                                   21


        HAZMAT is a Class I ODS because the authorizing offices cannot approve the use of a Class
        I ODS in the absence of a requiring document (see paragraph 4.4.1.).
        2.5.3.1.6. When a process-specific authorization is required, the Authorizing Offices may
        only approve the use of that HAZMAT if a suitable material reduction or substitution is not
        feasible. NOTE: The SM office that controls a TO is the only organization that can make
        changes to the HAZMAT usage required by the TO. Refer to Chapter 3 for guidance on
        requesting TO changes.
        2.5.3.1.7. The HAZMART will work with the AF Form 3952 Authorizing Offices to identify
        the least hazardous available material that complies with the requiring document. NOTE: This
        requirement does not apply in the case of pure products, such as Class I ODS from the DLA
        Class I ODS Defense Reserve, and it does not apply when all qualified manufacturers provide
        essentially the same formulation (in the opinion of the Authorizing Offices).
        2.5.3.1.8. Once the Authorizing Offices have agreed on the least hazardous (from an inte-
        grated ESOH perspective) of the available materials, the HAZMART will advise the requestor
        of the recommended selection, and, with the requestor’s concurrence, ensure that it is properly
        reflected on the AF Form 3952. The AF Form 3952 must specify the least hazardous materials,
        using the manufacturer name/Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code and part
        number/trade name. The HAZMART can only issue to the requestor items specifically identi-
        fied on the AF Form 3952.
        2.5.3.1.9. Work area supervisors shall provide copies of their completed AF Form 3952 to
        their unit Safety representative and their Unit Environmental Coordinator (UEC), where one is
        designated, for informational purposes.
     2.5.3.2. Each of the AF Form 3952 Authorizing Offices (CE, SE, and BE) will make an indepen-
     dent determination of whether to authorize the HAZMAT use as specified by the requestor, autho-
     rize with additional restrictions (specified in the Remarks Block of the AF Form 3952), or not
     authorize the request. If any one Authorizing Office does not authorize, then the request is denied.
     The requestor must comply with all restrictions specified by the Authorizing Offices.
        2.5.3.2.1. When an Authorizing Office decides to authorize without additional restrictions, it
        must then determine whether to issue a process-specific or blanket authorization. Process-spe-
        cific authorizations approve the use of a particular HAZMAT in a given process in specified
        amounts. Blanket authorization approves the use of a particular unit of issue of a HAZMAT
        independent of process.
        2.5.3.2.2. Each of the AF Form 3952 Authorizing Offices (CE, SE, and BE) will make an
        independent determination of whether or not to provide a blanket authorization for a specific
        HAZMAT and HAZMAT container size. Each of the offices providing a blanket authorization
        must also specify a HAZMAT container size and maximum draw amount for the HAZMAT.
        Blanket authorizations must identify specific National Stock Numbers (NSNs) and specific
        qualified products under that NSN, or specific material and container size. In addition, users
        must stay within the maximum draw amounts specified on their AF Form 3952 for the blanket
        authorization to remain valid. If all three AF Form 3952 Authorizing Offices (CE, SE, and BE)
        have provided blanket authorization for a material, the HAZMART shall issue the material to
        subsequent requestors that have completed sections I, II, and VI of AF Form 3952, without
        routing the AF Form 3952 to the Authorizing Offices.
22                                                    AFI32-7086_AFMCSUP1_I 10 APRIL 2006


        2.5.3.2.3. If an authorizing office declines to issue a blanket authorization, that office must
        provide a process-specific approval for all subsequent AF Form 3952 requests to use that
        HAZMAT.
        2.5.3.2.4. It is not necessary for all three (CE, SE, and BE) authorizations to be of the same
        type (blanket or process-specific). However, all three offices must authorize (or review for
        contractor submittals) the request before the user can obtain the requested HAZMAT. (Blocks
        #4 and #9 of Figure 2.1.)
     2.5.3.3. Once the requestor has obtained all three authorizations, the HAZMART adds the autho-
     rization to the Authorized Users List (AUL) in the standardized Air Force HAZMAT tracking sys-
     tem. (Block #10 of Figure 2.1.) However, requests for an ODS must also meet the SAO approval
     requirements in Chapter 4 before being included on the AUL. NOTE: The AUL should be used
     in place of the Standard Base Supply System (SBSS) health hazard approval listing (HHAL).
     There will be only one Issue Exception (IEX) Code for HAZMAT -- IEX Code 9. Current NSNs
     assigned IEX Codes 8 and M will need to be updated by the LRS/Regional Supply Squadron
     working with the installation HMMP Team. For more information on SBSS IEX codes please
     refer to AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual, Vol. II, Part Two, Chapter 14.
     2.5.3.4. The HAZMART may not procure or issue HAZMAT to a requestor unless the requestor
     is on the AUL for that HAZMAT.
     2.5.3.5. Requestors must maintain copies of their completed AF Form 3952s or electronic equiv-
     alents for active authorizations, to include supporting documentation.
     2.5.3.6. HAZMARTs must maintain a file of all completed AF Form 3952s in either hard copy or
     electronic equivalent.
     2.5.3.7. AF Form 3952s will automatically expire after a period to be determined by the installa-
     tion HMMP team, unless revalidated IAW paragraph 2.10.1.9.
     2.5.3.8. Work area supervisors must notify the HAZMART of any changes to the information on
     an approved AF Form 3952. NOTE: Changes to the HAZMAT composition (as reflected in the
     MSDS) or to the conditions of use or processes described in AF Form 3952 invalidates the autho-
     rization.

     2.5.4. HAZMAT Authorization Procedures for Tenant Units.
        2.5.4.1. Tenant units must follow general procedures outlined in paragraph 2.5.3.
        2.5.4.2. Support agreements may specifically delegate CE, SE, and/or BE authorization responsi-
        bilities to the tenant. Even if the base delegates CE authorization authority to a tenant unit, the ten-
        ant unit must still notify the base CE of all AF Form 3952 requests before final authorization.
     2.5.5. HAZMAT Determination and Authorization Procedures for Contractors
        2.5.5.1. Contractors operating a HAZMART must comply with the requirements in paragraph
        2.4. to participate in and enforce the HAZMAT authorization procedures. Contractors operating a
        HAZMART do not require AF Form 3952 authorizations to perform the HAZMART supply func-
        tions of ordering, receiving, stocking, and storing HAZMAT.
        2.5.5.2. Contractors using HAZMAT on Air Force installations must comply with the authoriza-
        tion procedures in paragraph 2.5.3., as modified below.
           2.5.5.2.1. If a contract is expected to require a contractor to bring or to use HAZMAT on an
           installation, the Contracting Office shall include both Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)
           Clause 52.223-3, Hazardous Material Identification and Material Safety Data, current edition,
           AFFARS Clause 5352.223-9003, and installation-specific contract requirements.
           2.5.5.2.2. IAW paragraph 2.10.1.10., HMMP team representatives will provide the contract-
           ing office with installation-specific contract requirements (for inclusion in the contract)
           regarding how contractors must request AF Form 3952 authorization and report the required
           HAZMAT usage data to the HAZMART.
           2.5.5.2.3. IAW FAR Clause 52.223-3, each offeror must provide the Contracting Office with
           a list of proposed HAZMAT that it plans to use on the installation during the performance of
           the contract. IAW AFFARS Clause 5352.223-9003, contractors must obtain Air Force authori-
           zation prior to using HAZMAT on an Air Force installation, and must report usage data to the
           HAZMART.
           2.5.5.2.4. Contractors must submit to the Contracting Office the information and supporting
           documentation (including MSDS) necessary to obtain HAZMAT usage authorization. The
           Contracting Office will transmit the contractor submittal to the HAZMART for processing. If
           the HAZMAT is a Class I ODS, the contracting officer must also have a copy of the applicable
           and current SAO approval of the Class I ODS requirements (see paragraphs 4.3.1., 4.3.6., and
           4.5.). NOTE: Contractors are not required to coordinate with a government UEC or Unit
           Safety Representative.
           2.5.5.2.5. For each contractor-identified HAZMAT that the HMMP team determines does not
           meet the Air Force definition of a HAZMAT, the IHMP requirements do not apply. The
           HMMP team will notify the Contracting Office that the contractor has authorization to bring
           and use that material on the installation without reporting usage.
           2.5.5.2.6. For each contractor-identified HAZMAT that the HMMP team determines does
           meet the Air Force definition of a HAZMAT, the Air Force will require CE authorization and
           SE and BE review of the AF Form 3952 information. The CE authorization is for environmen-
           tal, fire protection concerns, and emergency response purposes only. The SE and BE reviews
           are “for information purposes only” (see AF Form 3952), and do not involve evaluation and
AFI32-7086_AFMCSUP1_I 10 APRIL 2006                                                                    25


          approval of the contractor’s safety and health programs. The purpose of the SE and BE review
          is to identify potential risks to government personnel and resources and advise CE and the
          Contracting Office on how to mitigate identified hazards from planned contractor HAZMAT
          usage. If the HAZMAT is a Class I ODS, CE must ensure there is an applicable and current
          SAO approval for the contract Class I ODS requirements before signing the AF Form 3952.
          2.5.5.2.7. The HAZMART ensures entry of the contractor supplied information into the stan-
          dardized Air Force HAZMAT tracking system. This action includes the addition of the con-
          tractor to the AUL.
          2.5.5.2.8. Report data on the HAZMAT used during the performance of the contract at inter-
          vals and in the format specified by the HMMP team.
          2.5.5.2.9. If the contractor needs to bring a material on the installation that was not included
          in the original HAZMAT listing, the contractor must first notify the Contracting Office and
          then obtain prior authorization, if the HMMP team determines the material to be a HAZMAT.
   2.5.6. GPC Authorization Procedures.
       2.5.6.1. As required in AFI 64-117, Air Force Government-wide Purchase Card Program, indi-
       vidual cardholders must obtain prior authorization before using the GPC to purchase HAZMAT.
       2.5.6.2. The individual cardholders must process, at the time of receipt, each authorized
       HAZMAT purchase -- initial and recurring -- through the HAZMART for the material to be
       reviewed for consistency with the authorization (amounts, MSDS, draw frequency, etc.), for bar
       coding (or approved equivalent, IAW 2.10.1.8.), and for recording of “receipt and issue” in the
       standardized Air Force HAZMAT tracking system. HAZMART personnel are not required to
       deliver any GPC-purchased HAZMAT items. NOTE: Installation HMMP Teams may establish
       alternative reporting procedures for GPC purchases of HAZMAT that have blanket approval from
       all three AF Form 3952 Authorizing Offices (CE, SE, and BE).

2.6. Deployment Planning. In planning for deployments, Installation Deployment Officers (IDOs), and
Unit Deployment Managers (UDMs) must consult the HMMP team when assigning the following
required HAZMAT management tasks. NOTE: For additional guidance, refer to Air Force Handbook
(AFH) 10-222, Volume 4, Environmental Guide for Contingency Operations; AFI 10-400, Aerospace
Expeditionary Force Planning; AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution; and AFI 10-404, Base
Support and Expeditionary Site Planning; Air Force Interservice Manual (AFMAN) 24-204(I), Preparing
Hazardous Materials For Military Air Shipments; AFI 32-7006, Environmental Program in Foreign
Countries, and Air Force Pamphlet (AFPAM) 91-216, USAF Safety Deployment and Contingency Pam-
phlet.
2.6. (AFMC) IDOs and UDMs will contact the HMMP Team Lead in CE.
   2.6.1. Pre-Deployment Requirements.
       2.6.1.1. Identify deploying unit HAZMAT usage (materials and amounts) required for the dura-
       tion of the deployment.
          2.6.1.1.1. Identify HAZMAT (materials and amounts) the deploying unit plans to take with it
          from the home station.
26                                                    AFI32-7086_AFMCSUP1_I 10 APRIL 2006


        2.6.1.1.2. Identify HAZMAT (materials and amounts) sustainment requirements, to include
        WRM.
     2.6.1.2. Obtain completed AF Form 3952 authorizations for the use of each identified HAZMAT
     requirement. Ensure the AF Form 3952s identify any special ESOH considerations for deployed
     unit usage (e.g., additional PPE not needed in normal shop environment or additional training for
     personnel not already trained in the usage of a given HAZMAT).
     2.6.1.3. Coordinate HAZMAT management requirements (for the duration of the deployment)
     with gaining MAJCOM/Theater Command (THEACOM) and/or deployment location.
        2.6.1.3.1. Determine whether there will be a gaining installation HAZMART or whether the
        deployed unit will be responsible for providing HAZMAT and for tracking and reporting
        HAZMAT usage during the deployment. Clearly define gaining installation HAZMART or
        deployed unit HAZMAT responsibilities, and obtain agreements from the affected organiza-
        tions.
        2.6.1.3.2. Identify any Overseas Environmental Baseline Guidance Document (OEBGD) or
        Final Governing Standards (FGS) requirements on transportation, use, or disposition of
        HAZMAT. NOTE: When these documents are not applicable, refer to the environmental guid-
        ance in the Operation Plan (OPLAN) or Operation Order (OPORD).
     2.6.1.4. Construct a deployment folder for each unit Mission Support Kit that contains HAZMAT.
     This folder will include as a minimum:
        2.6.1.4.1. Copies of the current manufacturer-specific MSDSs for each HAZMAT the deploy-
        ing unit plans to use.
        2.6.1.4.2. Approved copies of AF Form 3952s authorizing the chemical for a specific process
        or equivalent listing of information from the standardized Air Force HAZMAT tracking sys-
        tem.
        2.6.1.4.3. AFH 10-222, Vol. 4, Environmental Guide for Contingency Operations.
        2.6.1.4.4. Deployment HAZMAT inventory listing.
     2.6.1.5. Ensure that personnel tasked for deployment have appropriate PPE required for the
     deployment plus fit test and training certifications. NOTE: The deployment PPE requirements
     may differ from the home station PPE requirements.
     2.6.1.6. Establish plans and procedures to support the HAZMAT requirements (to include track-
     ing and reporting) for the deployed units.
        2.6.1.6.1. Determine how HAZMAT management functions performed by contractors at the
        home station will be accomplished during deployment.
        2.6.1.6.2. Include deploying contractors in the HAZMAT deployment planning process. Take
        into account the HAZMAT needs of contractors performing mission-related functions during
        deployments.
     2.6.1.7. Ensure that HAZMAT received for WRM storage is tracked by the standardized Air
     Force HAZMAT tracking system for the purposes of knowing where and how much WRM
     HAZMAT is on an installation. Tracking in Air Force HAZMAT system subject to information
AFI32-7086_AFMCSUP1_I 10 APRIL 2006                                                                   27


       security requirements. NOTE: Placement of HAZMAT into WRM will not require AF Form
       3952s until issued at the deployed location.
       2.6.1.8. See paragraph 4.7. for ODSP required tasks during deployments.
   2.6.2. Deployment Requirements.
       2.6.2.1. Download data for deployed HAZMAT from the home station standardized Air Force
       HAZMAT tracking system to show the material is no longer on the installation.
       2.6.2.2. Track HAZMAT usage data for the duration of the deployment (regardless of the source
       of the HAZMAT). Use the standardized Air Force HAZMAT tracking system, if available, for
       this.
       2.6.2.3. The issuing of HAZMAT from WRM at deployed locations will require the requestor to
       present an approved AF Form 3952.
   2.6.3. Re-Deployment Requirements.
       2.6.3.1. Notify the HAZMART at the deployed location, if available, of any serviceable
       HAZMAT the deployed unit is taking back to the home station.
       2.6.3.2. Update the home station standardized Air Force HAZMAT tracking system upon return
       from the deployment to reflect all HAZMAT the deployed unit brought back to the installation.
       2.6.3.3. Ensure proper disposition of excess HAZMAT.

2.7. HAZMAT Transportation Security. The Department of Homeland Security and the DOT, in con-
junction with other federal agencies, have mandated the implementation of increased measures to protect
shipments of HAZMAT and certain hazardous waste.
   2.7.1. HAZMAT Transportation Security Plans. On 25 Mar 2003, the DOT amended Title 49, Code
   of Federal Regulations, Part 172, Hazardous Materials Table, Special Provisions, Hazardous Materi-
   als Communications, Emergency Response Information, and Training Requirements, to require
   HAZMAT shippers and those that offer HAZMAT for shipment to establish security plans consistent
   with 49 CFR Part 172 requirements as of 25 Sep 03. Table 2.1. identifies the HAZMAT thresholds for
   those required to comply with this requirement. Specific guidelines for developing security plans have
   been incorporated into DOD 4500.9-R, Defense Transportation Regulation, Part II Cargo Move-
   ments, Chapter 205. An Operating Instruction (OI) entitled Security Plans for Complying with DOT
   Security Regulation is available for viewing or downloading at the HQ AFMC Logistics Support
   Office website and may be used as a guideline to develop individual security plans.
28                                                         AFI32-7086_AFMCSUP1_I 10 APRIL 2006


Table 2.1. HAZMAT Transportation Thresholds for Developing Security Plans.
A shipment in other than a bulk packaging of 2,268 kg (5,000 pounds) gross weight or more of one class
of HAZMAT for which placarding is required.
A shipment of a quantity of HAZMAT in a bulk packaging having a capacity equal to or greater than
13,248 L (3,500 gallons) for liquids or gases or more than 13.24 cubic meters (468 cubic feet) for solids.
A quantity of hazardous material that requires placarding in accordance with 49 CFR 172 subpart F.
A highway route-controlled quantity of a Class 7 (radioactive) material (as defined in 49 CFR 173.403).
More than 25 kilogram (kg) (55 pounds) of a Division 1.1, 1.2, or 1.3 (explosive) materials (as defined
in 49 CFR 173.50) in a motor vehicle, rail car or freight container.
More than one liter (L) (1.06 qt) per package of a material poisonous by inhalation that meets the criteria
for Hazard Zone A (as specified in Sec. 173.116(a) or 173.133(a) of this subchapter).
A select agent or toxin regulated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under Title 42, Code
of Federal Regulations, Part 73, Select Agents And Toxins.

     2.7.2. HAZMAT Transportation Security Training. The amendment of 49 CFR Part 172 also estab-
     lishes a requirement that security awareness training be provided for all employees responsible for
     shipping, receiving or handling HAZMAT. Training must include awareness of the security risks asso-
     ciated with HAZMAT transportation; methods designed to enhance transportation security; and how
     to recognize and respond to possible security threats. New employees eligible for training must
     receive the security awareness training within 90 days of employment. Receipt of this training must be
     documented in the employee’s training records (this is a one time requirement).
     2.7.3. Air Force activities that are required to maintain a security plan (see 2.7.1.) must give their
     employees in-depth security training on that security plan. This training must include the security plan
     objectives, specific security procedures, each employee’s responsibilities, actions to be taken in the
     event of a security breach, and the organization’s security structure.

Section 2C—IHMP Responsibilities

2.8. HQ USAF HMMP Team. The HQ USAF HMMP team as described in paragraphs 1.4.2. and 1.7.
will provide oversight, coordination, guidance, support, and resource advocacy for the IHMP.
     2.8.1. Ensure MAJCOM and DRU HMMP teams are implementing the IHMP as required in this AFI.
     2.8.2. Ensure that any contracting initiatives involving any aspect of the IHMP specifically define
     responsibilities for executing the affected IHMP elements and support Air Force deployment plan-
     ning.
     2.8.3. Provide representatives to participate in the standardized Air Force HAZMAT tracking system
     Configuration Control Board (CCB).

2.9. MAJCOM and DRU HMMP Teams. MAJCOM and DRU HMMP teams as described in para-
graphs 1.4.2. and 1.10.2. will:
     2.9.1. Ensure installation HMMP teams are implementing the IHMP as required in this AFI.
AFI32-7086_AFMCSUP1_I 10 APRIL 2006                                                                      29


   2.9.2. Ensure that any contracting initiatives involving any aspect of the IHMP specifically define
   responsibilities for executing the affected IHMP elements and any continuing or follow-on resource
   (funding and personnel) responsibilities.
       2.9.2.1. Each MAJCOM functional with installation IHMP responsibilities must, in coordination
       with the HMMP team, provide installations with guidance on outsourcing and privatization of
       installation IHMP responsibilities (including IHMP deployment), and require prior approval of
       installation decisions.
       2.9.2.2. Any aspect of the installation IHMP responsibilities, including the HAZMAT authoriza-
       tion responsibilities, can be performed by contractors, provided the contract complies with appli-
       cable federal and military procurement policies, and supports IHMP deployment requirements.
   2.9.3. Provide installations with guidance on authorizing and reporting GPC purchases of HAZMAT
   IAW paragraph 2.5.6.
   2.9.4. Provide representatives to support and participate in the standardized Air Force HAZMAT
   tracking system CCB.
   2.9.5. Review and assess the validity of changes to the standardized Air Force HAZMAT tracking
   system requested by installation HMMP teams, or MAJCOM or DRU personnel and forward vali-
   dated change requests to the standardized Air Force HAZMAT tracking system CCB for consider-
   ation.
   2.9.6. Provide guidance to installations on inclusion of IHMP responsibilities in deployment plans.
   NOTE: This guidance must address contractor-performed IHMP responsibilities.

2.10. Installations.
   2.10.1. The installation HMMP team, as described in paragraph 1.4.2. and 1.11.2. will:
       2.10.1.1. Ensure personnel meet all installation-level responsibilities for executing the IHMP.
       2.10.1.2. Determine for each requested potentially hazardous material whether it meets the
       HAZMAT definition in paragraph 1.3. and, therefore, must be tracked using the standardized Air
       Force HAZMAT tracking system. NOTE: The HAZMART notifies the team, IAW 2.4.2. and
       2.5.3.1.2., when a HAZMAT determination is necessary.
       2.10.1.3. Establish and implement procedures for HAZMAT reduction, recycling, reuse, or
       shelf-life control, in order to minimize the generation of HW. This includes reducing HAZMAT
       disposal through reduction, recycling, reuse, shelf-life control, etc. HMMP teams may recom-
       mend a change to a weapon system process to reduce the amount of HAZMAT required or dis-
       charged into the environment through the WSHP described in Chapter 3.
       2.10.1.4. Assess customer satisfaction periodically (e.g.; spot-check the time required to process
       AF Form 3952s), and make improvements whenever possible.
       2.10.1.5. Ensure that any contracting initiatives involving any aspect of the IHMP specifically
       define responsibilities for executing the affected IHMP elements IAW this AFI.
           2.10.1.5.1. Any IHMP task, including the HAZMAT authorization responsibilities, can be
           performed by contractors, provided the contract complies with applicable federal and military
           procurement policies, and supports IHMP deployment requirements.
30                                                    AFI32-7086_AFMCSUP1_I 10 APRIL 2006


        2.10.1.5.2. If any IHMP functional responsibilities are contracted out, they must remain under
        the purview of the individual functional office that this AFI assigns those responsibilities to.
     2.10.1.6. Develop local GPC procedures for HAZMAT purchases to implement the requirements
     in paragraph 2.5.6. Ensure the Contracting Office implements these procedures and includes them
     in the GPC training and guidance.
     2.10.1.7. Ensure that appropriate IHMP requirements described in paragraph 2.6. are accounted
     for in deployment planning.
        2.10.1.7.1. Ensure the UDMs include in the appropriate installation contingency deployment
        plans the HAZMAT deployment planning requirements described in paragraph 2.6., and assist
        the UDMs in executing those requirements during actual deployments.
        2.10.1.7.2. Ensure that HAZMAT management functions performed by contractors at the
        home station will be accomplished during deployment, either by inclusion in the contract or by
        assigning the responsibilities to government personnel qualified to perform the functions.
     2.10.1.8. Determine and document the procedures for effective tracking of HAZMAT from cradle
     to grave, for facilitating work center inspections for unauthorized HAZMAT, and for supporting
     the free-issue of unused HAZMAT. The preferred method is bar coding, but the installation
     HMMP team may develop and document alternative local procedures.
     2.10.1.9. Establish, document, and implement a schedule for and procedures to review and re-val-
     idate each AF Form 3952. The objective of this is to review process changes, demand history,
     technology changes, and requirements changes that could impact the validity of an authorization.
     2.10.1.10. Develop and execute procedures to ensure hazardous materials brought onto the instal-
     lation by all contractors are properly managed IAW paragraph 2.5.5.2. The HMMP team will work
     with the Contracting Office to develop and implement procedures to:
        2.10.1.10.1. Ensure that contracts for HAZMART operations or that involve the use of
        HAZMAT on the installation include FAR clause 52.223-3, AFFARS clause 5352.223.9003,
        and appropriate installation-specific contract requirements. NOTE: This requirement includes
        any effort to contract-out any HMMP responsibilities.

           AIR FORCE WEAPON SYSTEM HAZARDOUS MATERIALS (HAZMAT)
                              PROGRAM (WSHP)

Section 3A—WSHP Purpose and Objectives

3.1. WSHP Purpose. The WSHP describes how installation and MAJCOM HMMP teams can work
with the affected installation weapon system maintenance organizations and MAJCOM weapon system
Requirements Offices to use the existing weapon system management structure to identify, prioritize, val-
idate, advocate for, and fund weapon system-driven HAZMAT reduction needs. This enables installation
and MAJCOM priorities to drive weapon system HAZMAT reduction efforts, just as installation and
MAJCOM priorities drive all non-ESOH weapon system requirements.
   3.1.1. Weapon system-controlled HAZMAT usage refers to HAZMATs used in a specific process as
   defined by a TO or other SM-controlled technical manual or data.
   3.1.2. The WSHP is not a separate requirements generation process. Rather, it provides a roadmap
   and adds supporting structures to assist HMMP teams to integrate HAZMAT reduction needs into the
   existing weapon system management processes. A variety of documents describe the weapon system
   management processes. DODI 5000.2 provides the overarching guidance. However, the most relevant
   Air Force documents describing the Air Force weapon system requirements, identification, prioritiza-
   tion, funding, and execution processes include the following:
       3.1.2.1. AFPD 10-6, Mission Needs and Operational Requirements
       3.1.2.2. AFI 10-601, Mission Needs and Operational Requirements Guidance and Procedures
       3.1.2.3. AFPD 16-5, Planning, Programming, and Budgeting System
       3.1.2.4. AFI 16-501, Control and Documentation of Air Force Programs
       3.1.2.5. AFPD 63-1, Acquisition System
       3.1.2.6. AFPD 63-11, Modification System
       3.1.2.7. AFI 63-1101, Modification Management
       3.1.2.8. TO 00-5-1, AF Technical Order System
   3.1.3. Weapon systems and their maintenance processes drive the majority of HAZMAT uses on Air
   Force installations. AFI 63-1101 defines a weapon system as a combination of elements that function
   together to produce the capabilities required to fulfill a mission need, including hardware, equipment,
   software, and all Integrated Logistics Support elements, but excluding construction or other improve-
   ments to real property. SMs are responsible for modifying Air Force weapons systems when directed
   by the Lead Command. SMs alone have engineering control over weapons systems and their mainte-
   nance processes.
   3.1.4. The installation and MAJCOM HMMP teams determine whether or not to initiate a request to
   reduce or eliminate a weapon system HAZMAT requirement. The WSHP describes how installations,
   MAJCOMs, and SMs must work together in an integrated process to change weapon system
   HAZMAT requirements. The WSHP describes how to identify weapon system HAZMAT reduction
   needs to the weapon system Lead Command for validation, and how only validated needs are for-
40                                                        AFI32-7086_AFMCSUP1_I 10 APRIL 2006


     warded to the weapon system SM for engineering review and analysis. The SM makes a recommen-
     dation to the Lead Command for a proposed solution. When a Lead Command then decides to pursue
     a SM-recommended solution, the installation and MAJCOM HMMP teams work together to develop
     prioritized cost- and risk-based justifications for funding weapon system changes through the Plan-
     ning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution System (PPBE).
     3.1.5. Installation data are essential for identifying the existing weapon system-driven HAZMAT
     costs and risks and for identifying HAZMAT usage that can be avoided in the development of new
     systems. The WSHP describes how installations and MAJCOMs can use these data to identify and
     prioritize weapons system HAZMAT reduction needs and to work with the SMs to assess potential
     return on investment. MAJCOMs and HQ USAF need this information to make decisions on whether
     to fund specific weapon system HAZMAT reduction programs.

3.2. WSHP Objectives. The overall goal is to reduce weapon system HAZMAT usage, consistent with
mission accomplishment, with minimal TOC (inclusive of ESOH costs) and within acceptable levels of
risk.

Section 3B—WSHP Structure

3.3. WSHP Description. The WSHP describes how to integrate user-identified weapon system
HAZMAT reduction needs into both the existing weapon system management processes and into the
development of new weapon systems.
     3.3.1. For existing weapon system HAZMAT reduction needs, the WSHP involves the following:
        3.3.1.1. The first step is for the installation HMMP team to select weapon system-controlled
        HAZMAT process(es) it wishes to target for HAZMAT reduction or elimination. For instance,
        HMMP teams should focus on those HAZMAT requiring significant resources to effectively man-
        age. To target a particular HAZMAT for reduction or elimination the HMMP team should:
            3.3.1.1.1. Begin this process by identifying the HAZMAT usage driving significant ESOH
            risks and/or costs.
            3.3.1.1.2. Then identify weapon system processes driving the HAZMAT usage of concern.
            3.3.1.1.3. Work with the affected installation weapon system maintenance organizations to
            decide which weapon system processes to target. The AFI will refer to these selected weapon
            system HAZMAT processes as "candidate processes."
        3.3.1.2. The installation HMMP team will then coordinate efforts with the affected installation
        weapon system maintenance organizations to collect the data needed to support MAJCOM evalu-
        ation of the changes to the one or more candidate processes. This data should represent the instal-
        lation HMMP team's estimates of annual usage and estimates of associated costs and risks by
        specific process, as defined by the TO reference or other SM-controlled technical data or Techni-
        cal Manuals. The process-specific installation data collection effort should focus on estimates of
        the following information:
            3.3.1.2.1. Annual HAZMAT usage for each candidate process
            3.3.1.2.2. Annual HAZMAT procurement costs for each candidate process
AFI32-7086_AFMCSUP1_I 10 APRIL 2006                                                                   41


        3.3.1.2.3. Annual environmental control equipment costs associated with the HAZMAT usage
        in each candidate process, to include amortized costs of equipment and operational and main-
        tenance costs
        3.3.1.2.4. Annual HAZMAT or HW disposal costs associated with each candidate process
        3.3.1.2.5. Annual PPE costs associated with each candidate process
        3.3.1.2.6. Annual occupational health and safety (surveillance and compliance) costs associ-
        ated with each candidate process
        3.3.1.2.7. Level of process risk as documented through an ORM evaluation
        3.3.1.2.8. Associated personnel and overhead costs
     3.3.1.3. For a specific candidate process, the HMMP team must work with the affected installa-
     tion weapon system maintenance organizations to decide whether to submit the desired HAZMAT
     reduction request through either the weapon system modification process or the TO change pro-
     cess. At this stage, this is a common sense determination. Ultimately the SM will decide whether
     the candidate process requires either a TO change or hardware modification or both. Figure 3.1.
     identifies the different steps for submitting a request to change either the weapon system itself or
     the documentation that controls a specific operational or maintenance process.
        3.3.1.3.1. If the HAZMAT reduction requires a change to an existing weapon system, then the
        HMMP team must work with the affected installation weapon system maintenance organiza-
        tions to submit the request to change a candidate process IAW the Permanent Modification
        Process described in AFI 63-1101 and depicted in Figure 3.2. This requires the installation
        weapon system maintenance organization to submit an AF Form 1067, Modification Pro-
        posal, to the MAJCOM Modification Requirements OPR, with the installation-level HMMP
        team providing copies to the MAJCOM HMMP team so that it can work with the MAJCOM
        Modification Requirements OPR to evaluate the requested change.
        3.3.1.3.2. If the installation-level HMMP team and weapon system maintenance organization
        decide it is possible to accomplish the HAZMAT reduction with only a change to a TO (or
        other SM-controlled technical data or Technical Manual), then the installation HMMP team
        will work with the weapon system maintenance organization to submit either a Joint Com-
        puter-Aided Acquisition and Logistics Support (JCALS) Program recommended change or an
        AFTO Form 22 to their MAJCOM Command Control Point (CCP) IAW Chapter 5 of the TO
        00-5-1, as depicted in Figure 3.3. The installation weapon system maintenance organization
        must submit the recommended change as an “Urgent Recommendation” for a TO “Improve-
        ment.” In addition, the installation HMMP team must submit copies of the recommended TO
        change to the MAJCOM HMMP team, so that the MAJCOM HMMP team can work with the
        MAJCOM CCP to evaluate the requested change.

        3.3.1.3.3. The installation HMMP team must also provide the MAJCOM HMMP team with
        the cost and risk data associated with the specific candidate process so that the MAJCOM
        HMMP team can use the data to support the MAJCOM and Lead Command validation pro-
        cess.
     3.3.1.4. The MAJCOM HMMP team will coordinate the consolidation of the candidate process
     data MAJCOM-wide and support the efforts of the MAJCOM and Lead Commands to validate
     and prioritize the installation inputs for further analysis by the SM.
        3.3.1.4.1. MAJCOM weapon system OPRs (either the MAJCOM Modification Requirements
        OPR or the MAJCOM CCP) are the only offices that can validate weapon system candidate
        process change requests. The MAJCOM HMMP teams must assist the appropriate MAJCOM
        OPRs in their review of the installation weapon system maintenance organization-submitted
        weapon system modification request or TO change request.
        3.3.1.4.2. If the MAJCOM is not the Lead Command for the subject weapon system, the
        MAJCOM must forward the requested candidate process change to the Lead Command
        weapon system OPRs (either the Lead Command Configuration Review Board [CRB] or the
        Lead Command CCP) with a request to validate the change. The MAJCOM HMMP team must
        also provide the Lead Command HMMP team with the cost and risk data associated with the
        specific candidate process, and request that the Lead Command HMMP team support the val-
        idation process.
        3.3.1.4.3. Lead Commands, working with the program offices, will provide greater TOC
        fidelity, as necessary, to make a decision on whether to validate a candidate process change
        request. For the purpose of the WSHP, TOC consists of identifiable life-cycle costs that can be
        assessed either qualitatively or quantitatively in support of comparisons between various alter-
        natives for making a recommended TO or hardware change. Paragraph 3.3.1.2. describes the
        installation-level identifiable costs.
     3.3.1.5. If the Lead Command validates the requested weapon system candidate process change
     request, the Lead Command weapon system OPR forwards it to the responsible SM.
     3.3.1.6. For validated needs, the Lead Command will first obtain inputs from the SM on a Rough
     Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimate of the scope and costs to make a change prior to directing an
     SM to perform a complete “opportunity assessment” of potential changes to the candidate process.
     3.3.1.7. If directed by the Lead Command , the SM will perform a detailed opportunity assess-
     ment for the candidate process. This will include, but is not limited to, the following:
        3.3.1.7.1. Identification of alternative materials, equipment, or procedures that can reduce or
        eliminate the HAZMAT usage.
        3.3.1.7.2. Performance of a Life Cycle Analysis to assess the TOC of the existing HAZMAT
        usage for each candidate process, based on the annual cost data provided by the MAJCOMs
        and the SM’s official assessment of the expected life of the process.
        3.3.1.7.3. Performance of a Life Cycle Analysis to assess the TOC of each alternative modifi-
        cation, to include the costs of each alternative and the resulting life cycle costs.
        3.3.1.7.4. Evaluations of the ESOH risks and costs associated with each alternative, with the
        requirement that no alternative create new environment, safety, or occupational health risks, as
46                                                        AFI32-7086_AFMCSUP1_I 10 APRIL 2006


           compared to the current situation, unless there is a formal risk acceptance decision by both the
           SM and the MAJCOM.
        3.3.1.8. The SM provides the Lead Command with prioritized recommendations on the alterna-
        tives, based in part on a return on investment assessment of the information above.
        3.3.1.9. The Lead Command HMMP team must then work with the Lead Command offices
        responsible for deciding whether to approve funding and implementation of a SM-recommended
        alternative (for either a weapon system modification or TO change).
           3.3.1.9.1. If the Lead Command decides to proceed with the requested HAZMAT reduction
           change, it becomes part of the normal weapon system PPBE.
           3.3.1.9.2. The Lead Command HMMP team must then work with the HQ USAF HMMP team
           to support and advocate for funding through the HQ USAF Corporate Structure.
        3.3.1.10. For those approved weapon system modifications or TO changes that either the Lead
        Command or HQ USAF ultimately decide not to fund, the Lead Command HMMP teams must do
        the following:
           3.3.1.10.1. Work with the responsible SM to include the requested changes in later system
           modification projects whenever technically and economically feasible.
           3.3.1.10.2. Work with Lead Command new weapon system Requirements Office to ensure
           that the needed changes are incorporated in the requirements for appropriate new systems.
     3.3.2. For HAZMAT reduction needs for new weapon systems, the WSHP involves the inclusion of
     HAZMAT limitations or other ESOH requirements into the Capability Development Document
     (CDD).
        3.3.2.1. The CDD documents operational and performance oriented requirements, with thresh-
        olds and objectives stated in terms of system-specific capabilities, characteristics, and other
        related variables. The CDD does not direct the use of specific system designs or specifications, or
        require compliance with policy, laws or agreements. It is inappropriate to state in the CDD that the
        desired system will comply with ESOH AFIs. For example, a CDD cannot require compliance
        with AFI 32-7086, but the CDD can prohibit the use of any Class I ODS. System specific require-
        ments can include tailored application of requirements from this and other ESOH AFIs, laws and
        standards. Generic, boilerplate requirements cannot be included in CDDs.
        3.3.2.2. To assist in the identification and justification of system-specific HAZMAT and other
        ESOH requirements in a CDD for a new system, the Lead Command HMMP team can use the fol-
        lowing sources of information from similar systems or the systems being replaced:
               HAZMAT usage data and validated HAZMAT reduction needs
               Compliance site data for sites involving HAZMAT usage
               Mishap data involving HAZMAT
               ORM information involving HAZMAT usage
        3.3.2.3. Lead Command HMMP teams must work with the Lead Command Requirements Office
        to propose and advocate for HAZMAT and other ESOH CDD requirements that are system-spe-
        cific. The HMMP teams for MAJCOMs that will receive the new system when it is fielded should
        support the Lead Command HMMP team in the CDD process.

          AIR FORCE OZONE DEPLETING SUBSTANCE (ODS) PROGRAM (ODSP)

Section 4A—ODSP Purpose and Objectives

4.1. ODSP Purpose. In this AFI, the term ODS refers to Class I and Class II ODS as listed in Table 4.1.
and Table 4.2., respectively. By international agreement (i.e. The Montreal Protocol on Substances that
Deplete the Ozone Layer), all ODS production is to cease. Consumption, transportation, use, and disposal
of ODS are governed by the Clean Air Act (CAA) sections 601-618 (Title 42, United States Code, Section
7671-7671q); Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 82, Protection of Stratospheric Ozone, current
edition; and. EO 13148. The ODSP manages the Air Force’s continued reliance on ODS to: (1) minimize
the risks to mission capability; (2) minimize the costs to the Air Force; (3) ensure the Defense Logistics
Agency (DLA) Class I ODS Defense Reserve stockpile of Class I ODS can support the existing Weapon
System requirements until those systems leave the inventory; (4) eliminate Air Force usage of Class I
ODS when required to maintain mission capability or when there is a validated business case for an alter-
native that does not increase environmental, safety, and health risks and costs; (5) eliminate Air Force
usage of Class II ODS before it becomes necessary to establish a stockpile of Class II ODS; and (6) ensure
compliance with applicable international agreements, federal laws, and regulations governing ODS
usage.
   4.1.1. Class I ODS. By international agreement, all Class I ODS production effectively ended on 31
   December 1995. Because of this, continued reliance on Class I ODS usage presents potential risks to
   Air Force mission capability and costs. It is critical to mission capability and the reduction in costs
   that the Air Force effectively manages these risks. Table 4.1. lists the Class I ODS covered by this
   AFI. In addition to the Class I ODS in Table 4.1., there is a category of Class I ODS called Hydrobro-
   mofluorocarbons (HBFCs). This AFI does not list HBFCs because there are no known USAF uses of
   HBFCs, and the USAF does not stockpile this ODS.

     4.1.2. Class II ODS. By international agreement, all Class II ODS production levels, as of 01 January
     1996, became the "base levels" from which incremental reductions will occur until all Class II produc-
     tion has ceased by the year 2030. Dependence on Class II ODS usage beyond the year 2015 will create
     potentially increasing risks to Air Force mission capability and costs. It is critical to mission capability
     and the reduction in costs that the Air Force minimizes these risks. Table 4.2. lists the Class II ODS
     covered by this AFI. The incremental phase out of all Class II ODS production will occur according
     to the schedule in Table 4.3.

4.2. ODSP Objectives. The ODSP objectives include:
     4.2.1. Eliminating ODS usage through the implementation of economically and technically feasible
     alternatives or the replacement of ODS-dependent systems at the end of their service lives. Alterna-
     tives must be non-ODS, commercially available materials that will not increase environmental, safety,
     or occupational health risks and costs.
     4.2.2. Minimizing the release of ODS into the environment through a robust responsible use program
     IAW Section 608 of the CAA (42 USC 7671g) and its implementing regulations.
     4.2.3. Managing, through careful stewardship, the allocation of mission critical Air Force supplies of
     Class I ODS and the recovery and reclamation of used or excess supplies of Class I ODS to ensure
     timely support of mission accomplishment and to support existing weapon system requirements for
     Class I ODS until those systems leave the inventory at the end of their expected service life.

Section 4B—ODSP Structure

4.3. ODSP Senior Acquisition Official (SAO) Authority.
     4.3.1. The Air Force initially established the ODSP SAO offices to meet the legal requirements for
     SAO approvals of contractual requirements to use a Class I ODS and then expanded the SAO office
     responsibilities to provide centralized HQ Air Force control of the overall ODSP.
     4.3.2. Section 326 of the Fiscal Year 1993 National Defense Authorization Act requires SAO
     approval of contract requirements for the use of a Class I ODS or of contract requirements that can
     only be met by the use of a Class I ODS.
     4.3.3. The overall goal of having officially designated SAO authorities is to maintain effective man-
     agement by Air Force Senior Leadership of the ODSP because of its critical mission readiness impli-
     cations.
     4.3.4. Air Force SAO authority is limited to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Science, Technology,
     and Engineering (SAF/AQR), HQ USAF/ILE, HQ USAF/ILM, and HQ USAF/ILG general officers
     or civilian equivalents.
     4.3.5. The SAO authority applies to the issuance of ODSP policy guidance, approval of contractual
     requirements for Class I ODS, management of the DLA Class I ODS Defense Reserve stockpile,
     approval of Class I ODS alternatives, and approval of Class II ODS requirements beyond 2020.
        4.3.5.1. To ensure a balance of environmental, weapon system engineering and technical manage-
        ment, and logistics considerations, HQ USAF/ILE, SAF/AQR, and either HQ USAF/ILG or HQ
        USAF/ILM must concur on each SAO decision before any one of the four offices can issue the
        decision.
        4.3.5.2. However, the four SAO offices delegate to the HQ USAF HMMP team approval author-
        ity for the individual requisitions from the DLA Class I ODS Defense Reserve stockpile, with the
        requirement that the HQ USAF HMMP team provide summary reports and analyses of those req-
        uisitions to the four SAO approval authorities, as necessary.
     4.3.6. SAO authority only applies to those products that are pure ODS. "Pure" ODS are those prod-
     ucts that conform to the military or commercial specifications that define the formulations of the ODS
     listed in Table 4.1. and Table 4.2. The Air Force and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) refer to
AFI32-7086_AFMCSUP1_I 10 APRIL 2006                                                                   53


   these specifications when either buying new product or recycling/reclaiming used product. For Class
   I ODS, the following specifications apply:
      1,1,1-Trichloroethane: ASTM D4126, Standard Specification for Vapor-Degreasing
             Grade and General Solvent Grade 1,1,1-Trichloroethane, January 4, 1993
      CFC-113: MIL-C-81302, Cleaning Compound, Solvent, Trichlorotrifluoroethane, August 6, 1965
      Halon 1301: ASTM D5632-01, Standard Specification for Halon 1301,
            Bromotrifluoromethane (CF3Br), October 10, 2001
      Halon 1211: MIL-B-38741, Bromochlorodifluoromethane, Technical, April 8, 1984
      Halon 1202: MIL-D-4540B, Dibromodifluoromethane, July 30, 1979
      All CFC refrigerants: ARI Standard 700, Specification for Fluorocarbon Refrigerants
            and Other Refrigerants, 1999

4.4. Class I ODS Program. The Class I ODS Program has five key elements: the AF Form 3952 Autho-
rization Process, the DLA Class I ODS Defense Reserve Management Process, the Prohibition on
Requirements for Contractors to use Class I ODS, the SAO Approval Process, and the Metrics.
   4.4.1. AF Form 3952 Authorization Process. Refer to paragraph 2.5. for a detailed description of the
   process. Units can only obtain Class I ODS through an installation HAZMART, which requires an
   approved AF Form 3952. An AF Form 3952 for a Class I ODS cannot be approved unless it identifies
   a requiring document that specifies the exclusive use of a Class I ODS.
      4.4.1.1. (Added-AFMC) If the requiring document, e.g., TO, owner’s manual, etc., calls out any
      suitable substitute, the request for approval will be disapproved.
   4.4.2. DLA Class I ODS Defense Reserve Stockpile Management.
      4.4.2.1. The purpose of the Congressionally authorized stockpile is to bridge the gap between the
      end of Class I ODS production and the cost-effective elimination of mission critical weapon sys-
      tem Class I ODS requirements (as described in paragraph 4.2.3.).
      4.4.2.2. The DLA Class I ODS Defense Reserve is the only Air Force approved source for obtain-
      ing Class I ODS. The Air Force prohibits its organizations from purchasing Class I ODS on the
      commercial market. However, the Air Force SAOs may approve commercial purchases of Class I
      ODS, on a by exception basis, until 31 December 2010 (as specified in EO 13148).
      4.4.2.3. The Air Force will only use these stockpiled supplies of Class I ODS to meet valid Air
      Force (or other Service) requirements.
      4.4.2.4. Only the four Air Force SAO approval authorities, as described in paragraph 4.3.4., may
      authorize the issuance of the stockpiled Class I ODS (see paragraph 4.3.5.2. for delegation of this
      authority) or approve DLA recommendations on the disposition of Air Force assets in the DLA
      Class I ODS Defense Reserve.
      4.4.2.5. Users of Class I ODS halons must return any excess amounts to the DLA Class I ODS
      Defense Reserve for recovery, reclamation, and redistribution. Installation and MAJCOM HMMP
      teams are permitted to shift stocks of Class I ODS refrigerants from one authorized user to
      another, before declaring them excess, and turning them in to the Defense Reserve. Users must
54                                                         AFI32-7086_AFMCSUP1_I 10 APRIL 2006


        responsibly dispose of used Class I ODS solvents in a manner that minimizes release to the envi-
        ronment.
        4.4.2.6. When it becomes necessary to service or replace an aircraft halon bottle, the unit must
        send the bottle, with its contents intact, to the Warner-Robins Air Logistics Center (WR-ALC) for
        recovery and reclamation of the halon and servicing or replacement of the bottle. There are only
        two exceptions to this.
            4.4.2.6.1. The unit should send all five-pound Halon 1211 fire bottles with their contents
            intact to the DLA Class I ODS Defense Reserve for recovery and reclamation of the halon and
            servicing or replacement of the bottle.
            4.4.2.6.2. If a unit has a mission-driven need to contract for halon recovery, reclamation, or
            bottle servicing, the unit must first obtain a contract SAO approval.
        4.4.2.7. Installation facility Class I ODS halon fire suppression and refrigerant air conditioning
        and refrigeration systems must rely on internal installation CE supplies of halons and refrigerants,
        without access to the DLA Class I ODS Defense Reserve stockpile.
            4.4.2.7.1. Each installation CE office has a Halon Management Plan that identifies each piece
            of facility equipment requiring either Halon 1211 or Halon 1301 and the amounts of those
            Class I ODS either installed in the equipment or in CE supply. The Halon Management Plan
            describes the planned phase out of each piece of equipment, the adequacy of the internal CE
            halon supplies to support the existing equipment without relying on the Defense Reserve
            stocks, and the plans to send excess supplies of Halon 1211 and Halon 1301 to the DLA Class
            I ODS Defense Reserve.
            4.4.2.7.2. Each installation CE office has a Refrigerant Management Plan that identifies all
            facility equipment containing a Class I ODS refrigerant that meets the recordkeeping and
            reporting requirements under Section 608 of the CAA (42 USC 7671g) and its implementing
            regulations. A plan shall identify amounts of Class I ODS either installed in the equipment or
            in CE supply. The Refrigerant Management Plan describes the planned phase out of each piece
            of equipment, the adequacy of the internal CE refrigerant supplies to support the existing
            equipment without relying on the DLA Class I ODS Defense Reserve stocks, and the plans to
            send excess supplies of Class I ODS refrigerants to the DLA Class I ODS Defense Reserve.
            NOTE 1: The Refrigerant Management Plan also includes all Class II ODS equipment and
            supplies. NOTE 2: The Refrigerant Management Plan must comply with the AFCESA Refrig-
            erant Management Handbook.
     4.4.3. Prohibition on Requirements for a Contractor to use a Class I ODS. A requiring activity may
     not include in solicitations or contracts any specification, standard, drawing, or other document that
     requires the use of, or establishes a requirement that can only be met by the use of, a Class I ODS in
     the manufacture, test, operation, or maintenance of any system, subsystem, item, component, or pro-
     cess.
        4.4.3.1. If a requiring activity requires a contractor to use a Class I ODS, or establishes a require-
        ment that the contractor can only meet by using a Class I ODS, it must first obtain SAO approval
        of each Class I ODS usage requirement. NOTE: A contract to operate a HAZMART does not
        require SAO approval for ordering, receiving, stocking, and storing of Class I ODS.
AFI32-7086_AFMCSUP1_I 10 APRIL 2006                                                                     55


     4.4.3.2. Contracting officers shall include the clause at 5352.223-9000, “Elimination of Use of
     Class I Ozone Depleting Substances (ODSs),” in all solicitations and contracts, unless the requir-
     ing activity certifies that there are no Class I ODS requirements in a given solicitation or contract.
     4.4.3.3. Unless SAO approval has been obtained, the AFFARS clause 5352.223-9000 prohibits
     contractors from providing any service or product with any specification, standard, drawing, or
     other document that requires the use of, or establishes a requirement that can only be met by the
     use of, a Class I ODS in the test, operation, or maintenance of any system, subsystem, item, com-
     ponent, or process. NOTE: This prohibition does not apply to manufacturing.
  4.4.4. Class I ODS SAO Approval Process.
     4.4.4.1. An Air Force organization must have a valid Class I ODS SAO approval before:
        4.4.4.1.1. Awarding a contract that requires the use, or has a requirement that can only be met
        by the use, of a Class I ODS.
        4.4.4.1.2. Obtaining Class I ODS from the DLA Class I ODS Defense Reserve through the
        installation HAZMART.
     4.4.4.2. SAO approvals granted under this process are intended to support existing Class I ODS
     usage requirements until it becomes possible to cost effectively eliminate those requirements.
        4.4.4.2.1. This enables the Air Force to comply with the requirement in EO 13148, Section
        505(b), to cost effectively phase out Class I ODS requirements as the equipment using the
        Class I ODS reach the end of their expected service lives.
        4.4.4.2.2. During equipment modification or upgrade programs, it may be also possible to
        cost effectively eliminate existing Class I ODS requirements if technically feasible, commer-
        cially available non-Class I ODS alternatives exist that do not increase environmental, safety
        or occupational health risks and costs.
     4.4.4.3. Each SAO approval of contractual requirements to use a Class I ODS must include the
     certification by an Appropriate Technical Representative (ATR) that there is currently no econom-
     ically and technically feasible commercially available substitute for the Class I ODS requirement
     that does not increase environment, safety or occupational health risks and costs.
     4.4.4.4. The Air Force has three kinds of Class I ODS SAO approvals, as follows:
        4.4.4.4.1. Weapon System Contract Class I ODS SAO Approvals. Weapon system or support
        system contracts that require the use of, or can only be met by, the use of Class I ODS, or
        which deliver an item containing Class I ODS, must have SAO approval as described in para-
        graph 4.5. These SAO approvals grant access to the DLA Class I ODS Defense Reserve on a
        case-by-case basis.
        4.4.4.4.2. MAJCOM-Wide Facility Halon and Class I ODS Refrigerant SAO Approvals.
        These SAO approvals grant authorization for all organic and contractor uses of Class I ODS in
        support of Air Force facilities. However, MAJCOM-wide facility Halon and Class I ODS
        refrigerant SAO approvals prohibit access to the DLA Class I ODS Defense Reserve and the
        purchase of Class I ODS.
56                                                        AFI32-7086_AFMCSUP1_I 10 APRIL 2006


            4.4.4.4.3. Class I ODS Requisition SAO Approvals. Each individual requisition of Class I
            ODS from the DLA Class I ODS Defense Reserve stockpile requires SAO approval from the
            HQ USAF HMMP team using the procedures in paragraph 4.6.
                4.4.4.4.3.1. (Added-AFMC) If an AFMC installation has several requirements for the
                same Class I ODS, they may consolidate requirements into one request for SAO approval.
                The HAZMART Class I ODS Representative must provide copies of all locally approved
                AF Forms 3952 for the consolidated requirements. One request for SAO approval can be
                submitted to the Depot Maintenance Logistics Environmental Organization within
                HQ AFMC as long as AF Forms 3952 have been locally approved and the servicing
                HAZMART has storage capability for total requested until issued.
     4.4.5. Class I ODS Metrics. The HQ USAF HMMP team will specify metric data requirements that
     installation HMMP teams must submit through their MAJCOM HMMP teams using the standardized
     Air Force HAZMAT tracking system. The SAO officials will use the Air Force-wide Class I ODS
     metrics to provide the basis for assessing the adequacy of the DLA Class I ODS Defense Reserve. The
     metric data will also provide the basis for any Air Force corporate decisions to eliminate Class I ODS
     requirements from existing weapons systems to reduce long-term requirements below available sup-
     plies in the DLA Class I ODS Defense Reserve.

4.5. Contract Class I ODS SAO Approval Requests.
     4.5.1. Attachment 3 contains copies of the two versions of AF Form 3953 for submittal of requests
     for a Contract Class I ODS SAO approval along with detailed instructions for filling out the forms.
        4.5.1.1. The AF Form 3953A (General Version) and instructions apply to all contracts that con-
        tain a requirement for the use of a Class I ODS, except those for halon fire bottle maintenance.
        4.5.1.2. The AF Form 3953B (Halon Fire Bottle Version) and instructions apply only to halon fire
        bottle maintenance contracts that contain a requirement for the use of a halon. NOTE: See para-
        graph 4.4.2.6.2. It is important to carefully review these contract requirements to ensure responsi-
        ble use of the halons, to include the recovery of halons from bottles being prepared for servicing.
     4.5.2. The legal requirement is for SAO approval of any requirement in a contract for the use of a
     Class I ODS or of any requirement in a contract that can only be met by the use of a Class I ODS.
     NOTE: The SAO is not approving the contract -- only the Class I ODS requirements within the con-
     tract.
     4.5.3. The contract requiring activity (an operational organization or SM Program Office) responsible
     for initiating a contract action is also responsible for preparing and submitting the Contract SAO
     Approval Application.
        4.5.3.1. The contract requiring activity should contact the installation HMMP team through the
        HAZMART for assistance, as necessary, in preparing the application.
        4.5.3.2. The contract requiring activity should submit the completed application to SAF/AQRE
        for staffing at HQ Air Force.
            4.5.3.2.1. Operational MAJCOM organizations should first submit the completed applica-
            tions through the MAJCOM HMMP team for review and approval.
AFI32-7086_AFMCSUP1_I 10 APRIL 2006                                                                   57


          4.5.3.2.2. SM Program Offices should submit the completed applications directly to SAF/
          AQRE, providing copies to the Program Executive Office or Designated Acquisition Com-
          mander office responsible for that Program Office.
          4.5.3.2.3. Either the MAJCOM HMMP team or the SM Program Office should coordinate the
          submittal of the application with SAF/AQRE in advance of the formal transmittal of the appli-
          cation to SAF/AQRE. This will help to minimize rework actions by the submitting organiza-
          tion.
      4.5.3.3. Before submittal to SAF/AQRE, the contract requiring activity must obtain the ATR cer-
      tification that there is no technically or economically feasible, commercially available non-ODS
      alternative that does not increase the environment, safety, or occupational heath risks and costs.
          4.5.3.3.1. If the contract requiring activity is an operational MAJCOM organization, it must
          obtain the ATR certification from the SM Program Office that has engineering control of the
          technical requirement for the use of the Class I ODS (e.g., the SM that controls the TO that
          requires the use of the Class I ODS).
          4.5.3.3.2. If the contract requiring activity is a SM Program Office, then the Program Manager
          or Chief Engineer (or a designee of either the Program Manager or Chief Engineer) can pro-
          vide the ATR certification.
      4.5.3.4. (Added-AFMC) The Depot Maintenance Logistics Environmental organization within
      HQ AFMC is the MAJCOM OPR for the Class I ODS Program. Using activities shall submit their
      requests to their Installation Class I ODS Representative. In turn, the Installation Class I ODS
      Representative shall route all requests through the Depot Maintenance Logistics Environmental
      organization within HQ AFMC. Requests will then be forwarded to SAF/AQR for SAO approval.
   4.5.4. SAF/AQRE staffs the application through the SAO approval offices at HQ Air Force and other
   HQ Air Force offices as appropriate.
   4.5.5. Use the following timelines for planning purposes in the preparation and staffing of a contract
   SAO approval request.
      4.5.5.1. Air Staff will notify the submitting MAJCOM whether SAO Approval request is
      accepted as complete within 5 workdays.
      4.5.5.2. Air Staff will process accepted requests within 45 days.

4.6. Requisitions from the DLA Class I ODS Defense Reserve.
   4.6.1. The Class I ODS Requisition SAO Approval process requires review of individual DLA Class
   I ODS Defense Reserve requisitions at all levels. To the greatest extent possible, the Air Force will
   conduct this process electronically, via e-mail, with the objective of providing SAO approval within
   five days of the initiation of the request.
   4.6.2. DLA Class I ODS Defense Reserve Requisition SAO Approval procedures are as follows. (See
   Figure 4.1.)
58                                               AFI32-7086_AFMCSUP1_I 10 APRIL 2006


Figure 4.1. Class I ODS Requisition SAO Approval Procedures
AFI32-7086_AFMCSUP1_I 10 APRIL 2006                                                                59


     4.6.2.1. Supervisors of a shop requiring Class I ODS must first complete the HAZMAT Authori-
     zation Process described at paragraph 2.5.3. Contractors submitting a requisition for a Class I
     ODS must also have completed the HAZMAT authorization process described in paragraph 2.5.5.,
     and there must be a current SAO approval for the contract requirement to use the Class I ODS.
     4.6.2.2. Before submitting a requisition for a locally authorized Class I ODS to the DLA Class I
     ODS Defense Reserve, HAZMART personnel will contact the MAJCOM HMMP team LG repre-
     sentative to initiate the Class I ODS Requisition process. HAZMART personnel will transmit to
     the MAJCOM HMMP team LG representative a copy of the relevant AF Form 3952 that autho-
     rizes the proposed requisition. The AF Form 3952 for a Contractor requisition must specify the
     applicable and current contract SAO approval number.
     4.6.2.3. The MAJCOM HMMP team LG representative will coordinate the MAJCOM HMMP
     team review of the proposed Class I ODS requisition. The MAJCOM HMMP team will base its
     review upon the completed installation-level AF Form 3952, and additional information requested
     by the MAJCOM or HQ USAF teams. The MAJCOM HMMP team LG representative will trans-
     mit to the HQ USAF HMMP team SAF/AQR representative a copy of the MAJCOM-approved
     request for SAO approval; a Class I ODS requisition; and the relevant AF Form 3952 that autho-
     rizes the proposed requisition.
        4.6.2.3.1. (Added-AFMC) The Installation HAZMART Class I ODS Representative will
        report any turn-ins of excess, recovered, and/or unserviceable Class I ODS to the Depot Main-
        tenance Logistics Environmental organization within HQ AFMC. In turn, HQ AFMC will for-
        ward this information to the DLA Defense Reserve. The Installation HAZMART Class I ODS
        Representative must maintain records of all Class I ODS turn-ins for accounting purposes.
        4.6.2.3.2. (Added-AFMC) The Installation HAZMART Class I ODS Representative will
        provide to the Depot Maintenance Logistics Environmental organization within HQ AFMC
        the specific requirement(s) for the requested Class I ODS. Requirements shall outline the spe-
        cific purpose; including aircraft and components to be serviced, as well as the amounts to be
        used and expected timeframe of use.
     4.6.2.4. The HQ USAF HMMP team SAF/AQR representative will coordinate the HQ USAF
     HMMP team review of the proposed Class I ODS requisition. The HQ USAF HMMP team will
     base each individual SAO approval determination on the completed installation-level AF Form
     3952; the recommendation of the MAJCOM HMMP team; additional information requested by
     the team; and an analysis of the projected Air Force Class I ODS usage rate.
     4.6.2.5. The HQ USAF HMMP team SAF/AQR representative will transmit the SAO approval
     directly to DLA Class I ODS Defense Reserve, the MAJCOM HMMP team LG representative,
     and the installation HAZMART.
     4.6.2.6. The installation HAZMART can then submit the formal requisition to the DLA Class I
     ODS Defense Reserve.
     4.6.2.7. (Added-AFMC) All AFMC HAZMART Class I ODS Representatives will submit
     requests for SAO approval through the Depot Maintenance Logistics Environmental organization
     within HQ AFMC for review. HQ AFMC will send forward MAJCOM approved requests to SAF/
     AQR for SAO disposition. In turn, the SAO will provide their disposition back to HQ AFMC, to
     be forwarded back to the Class I ODS Representative at the requesting installation.

4.7. Class I ODS Deployment Planning.
     4.7.1. ODS for deployed units will come from the DLA Class I ODS Defense Reserve stockpile and
     be issued through either the gaining installation HAZMART or through the deployed unit with
     HAZMAT management responsibilities.
     4.7.2. In addition to the HAZMAT management tasks for deployments identified in paragraph 2.6.,
     IDOs and UDMs must consult the HMMP team when assigning the following ODSP tasks:
        4.7.2.1. Pre-Deployment Planning Tasks.
            4.7.2.1.1. Coordinate Class I ODS usage requirements with gaining MAJCOM/THEACOM
            and/or deployment location as described in paragraph 2.6. This is especially critical for halon
            requirements.
            4.7.2.1.2. Determine whether there will be a gaining installation HAZMART or whether the
            deployed unit will be responsible for providing Class I ODS and for tracking and reporting
            Class I ODS usage during the deployment. Clearly define gaining installation HAZMART or
            deployed unit Class I ODS tracking responsibilities, and obtain agreements from the affected
            organizations.
        4.7.2.2. Deployment Tasks.
            4.7.2.2.1. Download data for deployed Class I ODS from the home station standardized Air
            Force HAZMAT tracking system to show the material is no longer on the installation.
            4.7.2.2.2. Track Class I ODS usage data for the duration of the deployment (regardless of the
            source of the Class I ODS). Use the standardized Air Force HAZMAT tracking system, if
            available, for this.
        4.7.2.3. Re-Deployment Tasks.
            4.7.2.3.1. Notify the deployed location HAZMART, if available, of any Class I ODS the unit
            is taking with them to the home station.
            4.7.2.3.2. Bring records of Class I ODS usage to the home station HMMP team, and data on
            Class I ODS amounts being returned to the home station HAZMART.
            4.7.2.3.3. Ensure the HAZMART updates the home station standardized Air Force HAZMAT
            tracking system with the Class I ODS data.
            4.7.2.3.4. Provide the HQ USAF HMMP team a report of Class I ODS deployment data
            (amounts deployed with, amounts issued during the deployment, amounts remaining with the
            gaining installation, and amounts returned to home station) and lessons learned. Within 60
            days of the end of each deployment, submit this report to SAF/AQRE through the HMMP
            teams for the installation and MAJCOM responsible for the deployed unit.
            4.7.2.3.5. Return all excess Class I ODS to the DLA Class I ODS Defense Reserve stockpile.

4.8. Class II ODS Program. The Class II ODS Program has two key elements: the AF Form 3952
Authorization Process and the Prohibition on New Class II ODS Requirements.
     4.8.1. AF Form 3952 Authorization Process. As a HAZMAT, Class II ODS usage requires prior
     approval through the AF Form 3952 Authorization Process. Refer to paragraph 2.5. for a detailed
     description of the process.
AFI32-7086_AFMCSUP1_I 10 APRIL 2006                                                                    61


   4.8.2. Prohibition on New Class II ODS Requirements. The Air Force will not centrally stockpile
   Class II ODS to support continuing requirements after the phase-out of Class II ODS production in the
   United States (see paragraph 4.1.2. for phase-out schedule). Therefore, the Air Force will not develop
   or procure any new weapon or facility systems scheduled to remain in the Air Force inventory beyond
   01 January 2020 that require Class II ODS in their operations or maintenance. The Air Force will not
   modify any existing weapon or facility systems scheduled to remain in the Air Force inventory
   beyond 01 January 2020 in any manner that adds requirements for Class II ODS in their operations or
   maintenance.
       4.8.2.1. SMs seeking an exception to this Class II ODS policy must apply for SAO approval,
       using the same process as Class I ODS Contract SAO approvals, described in paragraph 4.5.
       4.8.2.2. The Base Civil Engineer (BCE) has approval authority for exceptions to this Class II
       ODS policy for installation Real Property air conditioning and refrigeration equipment. BCE
       approval of an exception for installation Real Property air conditioning and refrigeration will
       require the following:
           4.8.2.2.1. Incorporation in the installation Refrigerant Management Plan of detailed descrip-
           tions of the BCE plans to support Class II ODS usage requirements throughout the life of the
           new or modified air conditioning or refrigeration equipment, without HQ USAF-supplied
           Class II ODS.
           4.8.2.2.2. Submission of the revised Refrigerant Management Plan, with changes highlighted,
           to the MAJCOM Refrigerant Manager and AFCESA for their review and comment.
           4.8.2.2.3. Annual review and certification by the BCE of the installation Refrigerant Manage-
           ment Plan, incorporating equipment and refrigerant changes during the previous year. NOTE:
           The Refrigerant Management Plan must comply with the AFCESA Refrigerant Management
           Handbook.

Section 4C—ODSP Responsibilities

4.9. SAF/AQ. SAF/AQR is the primary SAO approval authority within SAF/AQ. When necessary, SAF/
AQR may delegate this responsibility to another general officer or civilian equivalent within SAF/AQ. In
addition, SAF/AQR will:
   4.9.1. Provide additional guidance, as necessary, defining SM responsibilities under the ODSP.
   4.9.2. Provide additional contract SAO approval application guidance, as necessary.
   4.9.3. Serve as the HMMP team OPR for the ODSP, which includes the following responsibilities:
       4.9.3.1. Analysis of Class I ODS metrics data.
       4.9.3.2. Processing and staffing all Air Force SAO approval requests. In this role, the AQR repre-
       sentative must:
           4.9.3.2.1. Track requisitions from, and turn-ins to, the DLA Class I ODS Defense Reserve.
           4.9.3.2.2. Notify DLA when the HQ USAF HMMP team approves a requisition from the
           DLA Class I ODS Defense Reserve.
           4.9.3.2.3. Maintain historical SAO approval records.
62                                                        AFI32-7086_AFMCSUP1_I 10 APRIL 2006


            4.9.3.2.4. Work with SAF/AQC to maintain the AFFARS clause on Class I ODS requirements
            in contracts.
            4.9.3.2.5. Produce Air Force Class I ODS SAO approval reports as required by the Fiscal Year
            1993 National Defense Authorization Act and DOD policy.
     4.9.4. With the approval of the other SAOs, formally identify to weapon system SMs the preferable
     commercially available ODS alternatives for a specific type of weapon system ODS application (fire
     suppression, coolant, and solvent) in order to maximize commonality and economies of scale across
     systems (both Air Force and other service platforms). NOTE: Alternatives to Class I ODS for weapon
     system equipment or processes may not be used by base-level personnel without the formal approval
     of the SM for the weapon system, usually accomplished through a TO change.
        4.9.4.1. Preferable ODS alternatives must:
            4.9.4.1.1. Be technologically mature.
            4.9.4.1.2. Be commercially available without Air Force or DOD having to fund production
            capacity increases.
            4.9.4.1.3. Be economically feasible.
            4.9.4.1.4. Not increase environmental, safety, or occupational health risks and costs.
        4.9.4.2. SAF/AQR, with the approval of the other SAOs, has only designated one preferable ODS
        alternative to date: HFC-125 as the material replacement for halon in aircraft fire suppression
        applications.
        4.9.4.3. SAF/AQR, with the approval of the other SAOs, may designate other preferable alterna-
        tives as new materials or systems that meet the requirements in paragraph 4.9.4.1. become avail-
        able.

4.10. HQ USAF/IL. HQ USAF/ILE, HQ USAF/ILM, and HQ USAF/ILG are the primary SAO
approval authorities within HQ USAF/IL. In addition, HQ USAF/IL will:
     4.10.1. Integrate ODS management and conservation into installation Weapon Systems Maintenance
     and LRS processes through policies, procedures, and training.
     4.10.2. Ensure that HQ USAF/ILE develops MAJCOM-wide facility Halon and Class I ODS refrig-
     erant SAO approval procedures.
     4.10.3. Ensure that HQ USAF/ILG works with SAF/AQR as the SAO approval OCR for processing
     and staffing all Class I ODS requisition SAO approval requests.

4.11. MAJCOMs and DRUs.
     4.11.1. MAJCOM. MAJCOMs will use their HMMP teams to provide command oversight of the
     MAJCOM efforts to ensure a robust “responsible use” program for ODS in order to minimize release
     of ODS to the atmosphere. LG is primarily responsible for ODS in support of weapons systems, and

     AFFARS Clause 5352.223-9000 in solicitations and contracts.

4.13. Other Specialized Responsibilities.
     4.13.1. SM. SMs will reduce their systems’ reliance on ODS to as near zero as is technically and eco-
     nomically feasible; without increasing environment, safety, or occupational health risks and costs; and
     as is consistent with the Lead Command’s requirements and priorities.
        4.13.1.1. If the Lead Command for a existing (or legacy) system establishes a formal requirement
        to eliminate the use of an ODS, the SM will first identify any Air Force identified preferred alter-
AFI32-7086_AFMCSUP1_I 10 APRIL 2006                                                                    67


     natives for the application in question. In the absence of an Air Force identified preferred alterna-
     tive, the SM will then try to identify any commercially available, technically and economically
     feasible alternative processes or materials that do not increase environmental, safety, or occupa-
     tional health risks and costs (see paragraph 4.9.4.1.). SMs will use the system safety standard prac-
     tice in MIL-STD-882D to assess ESOH risk.
        4.13.1.1.1. Lead MAJCOM system users will provide the final determinations of economic
        feasibility through the PPBE process. This means that if the Air Force funds the lead MAJ-
        COM requirement, it is economically feasible. If the Air Force decides not to fund the MAJ-
        COM requirement, it is not economically feasible.
        4.13.1.1.2. SMs must assess supportability of existing ODS requirements through the pro-
        jected life of the system, based on obtaining the Class I ODS from the DLA Class I ODS
        Defense Reserve and Class II ODS from commercial sources. SMs should work with the HQ
        USAF HMMP team to assess the availability of DLA Class I ODS Defense Reserve assets.
        SMs will work with their systems’ lead commands to formally accept the supportability risks,
        using the system safety methodology defined in MIL-STD-882D.
     4.13.1.2. For systems in development, SMs will not include operational or maintenance Class I or
     Class II ODS requirements without Lead Command and SAO approval (see paragraph 3.3.2.1.).
     4.13.1.3. SMs will submit necessary SAO approval requests and will:
        4.13.1.3.1. Document why a non-ODS alternative is not commercially available and techni-
        cally and economically feasible without increasing environment, safety, or occupational health
        risks and costs using the MIL-STD-882D methodology to assess risks.
        4.13.1.3.2. Document the comparative TOCs between the ODS under consideration and the
        non-ODS alternatives. The TOC analysis will have to address design, development, test, pro-
        duction, operations, and maintenance for the projected life of the system.
        4.13.1.3.3. Assess the supportability and commonality advantages of any proposed ODS.
     4.13.1.4. For existing systems undergoing modifications or upgrades, SMs will not add any new
     Class I or Class II ODS requirements without Lead Command and SAO approval. In addition,
     SMs must work with the Lead Command for a modification or upgrade to identify potential oppor-
     tunities to eliminate existing ODS requirements. If the SM and Lead Command agree that there
     may be a potential opportunity to eliminate an existing ODS requirement, the SM will work with
     the Lead Command to include the following in the formal requirements document:
        4.13.1.4.1. A threshold requirement to formally evaluate the technical and economic feasibil-
        ity of replacing an ODS usage requirement with a commercially available non-ODS material
        or system without increasing environment, safety, or occupational health risks and costs.
        4.13.1.4.2. An objective requirement to replace the ODS requirement.
     4.13.1.5. In the SAO approval process, the SM Program Office must provide the ATR certifica-
     tion for weapon system Class I ODS requirements. The SM or chief engineer or their designee can
     provide the ATR certification.
     4.13.1.6. SMs must obtain SAO approval to convert from one ODS to another, if necessary to
     support mission accomplishment of an existing system.
68                                                       AFI32-7086_AFMCSUP1_I 10 APRIL 2006


        4.13.1.7. In seeking ODS replacements, SMs will:
           4.13.1.7.1. As the first option, use the SAF/AQR-identified preferred ODS alternatives (see
           paragraph 4.9.4.). NOTE: Using a SAF/AQR-identified alternative does not relieve SMs of
           their engineering responsibilities to integrate the alternative into their systems, to include
           assuring OSS&E.
           4.13.1.7.2. If SAF/AQR has not identified a preferred alternative, SMs will take a systems
           engineering approach to identify potential ODS replacements, placing a priority on commer-
           cially available, mature, and supportable systems that increase commonality and economies of
           scale across DOD systems. SMs must evaluate the environmental, safety, and health aspects of
           any non-preferred ODS replacement process or material. SMs will not pursue ODS alternative
           processes and materials that pose greater environmental, safety, or occupational health risks
           and costs than the ODS being replaced, using the MIL-STD-882D methodology to assess
           risks. SMs must assure the OSS&E, as required by AFI 63-1201.
           4.13.1.7.3. If SAF/AQR has identified a preferable ODS alternative (paragraph 4.9.4.), the
           SM must request SAO approval before working on a non-identified replacement. The SM
           request must demonstrate that the SM-proposed alternative does not impact OSS&E, and has
           the following benefits over the SAF/AQR-identified preferable replacement:
           The technical and economic feasibility advantages.
           The environment, safety, and occupational health advantages. This would include an assess-
           ment by the National Research Council Committee on Toxicology.
           The commercial availability, supportability, and technology maturity advantages.
           The TOC advantages.
     4.13.2. AFCESA.
        4.13.2.1. AFCESA is responsible for producing semiannual Halon reports.
           4.13.2.1.1. Sample Form 3521, Halon 1301 Semiannual Report, RCS: HAF-ILEV (SA)

           ing emergency conditions, Precedence Normal. Submit data requirements in this category as
           prescribed, or as soon as possible after submission of priority reports. Continue reporting dur-
           ing MINIMIZE.
        4.13.2.2. AFCESA will revise its Refrigerant Management Handbook and the appropriate Engi-
        neering Technical Letters to incorporate both Class I and Class II ODS refrigerant requirements.
        4.13.2.3. AFCESA will annually review installation Refrigerant Management Plans to include
        BCE-proposed revisions that incorporate exceptions to the Class II ODS policy for installation
        Real Property air conditioning and refrigeration equipment (IAW 4.8.2.2.2.).
AFI32-7086_AFMCSUP1_I 10 APRIL 2006                                                               69

Terms
Appropriate Technical Representative (ATR)—The individual responsible for certifying that there are
no Air Force preferred alternatives or commercially available, technically and economically feasible
alternatives for an existing ozone depleting substance (ODS) requirement that do not increase the
environment, safety, and occupational health risks and costs. It must be the person who has the authority
to change the process or design that requires the use of the ODS, e.g., the Single Manager (SM) of a
weapon system.
Authorized Users List (AUL)—The list of all completed AF Form 3952 authorizations, as recorded in
the standardized Air Force HAZMAT tracking system, for installation-level work areas to use specific
HAZMAT in specific processes (so long as the conditions described in the AF Form 3952 authorization
remain unchanged).
Blanket Authorization—The blanket authorization approves the use of a particular unit of issue of an
HAZMAT independent of process. Each of the AF Form 3952 Authorizing Offices (CE, SE, and BE) will
make an independent determination of whether or not to provide a blanket authorization for a specific
HAZMAT and HAZMAT container size. Each of the offices providing a blanket authorization must also
specify a maximum draw amount for the HAZMAT and HAZMAT container size. Blanket authorizations
78                                                         AFI32-7086_AFMCSUP1_I 10 APRIL 2006


must identify specific NSNs and specific qualified products under that NSN, or specific material and
container size. In addition, users must stay within the maximum draw amounts specified on their AF Form
3952 for the blanket authorization to remain valid. It is not necessary for all three (CE, SE, and BE)
authorizations to be of the same type (blanket or activity-specific). However, all three offices must
authorize (or review for contractor submittals) the request before the requestor can obtain the HAZMAT.
Candidate Process—A process that contains environmental, safety, and/or occupational health costs and/
or risks identified for reduction or elimination to drive down total ownership cost (TOC) within
acceptable levels of risk.
Compliance Costs—Costs incurred as a result of efforts to comply with applicable environmental, safety,
and occupational health laws, regulations, executive orders, and Department of Defense/Air Force
policies. Environment, Safety, and Occupation Health (ESOH)-driven compliance costs include, but are
not limited to, permit, disposal, control equipment, training, energy, and inefficiencies (such as increased
man-hours or power usage) resulting from use of PPE or pollution control equipment. A complete
accounting of ESOH-driven compliance costs must include those ESOH-driven compliance costs paid by
the shop, as well as those paid by civil engineering, surgeon general, safety, judge advocate, public affairs,
and other support organizations.
Configuration Control Board—The group responsible for consolidating, evaluating, ranking, and
recommending implementation or disapproval of suggested changes and improvements to the
standardized Air Force HAZMAT tracking system.
Consumer Use Item—Any consumer product or hazardous substance, as those terms are defined in the
Consumer Product Safety Act (Title 15, United States Code, Chapter 47, Section 2051, et seq.) and
Federal Hazardous Substances Act (Title 15, United States Code, Chapter 30, Section 1261, et seq.)
respectively, where the employer can show that it is used in the workplace for the purpose intended by the
chemical manufacturer or importer of the product, and the use results in a duration and frequency of
exposure which is not greater than the range of exposures that could reasonably be experienced by
consumers when used for the purpose intended.
Data Field—The smallest element (numeric or alphanumeric) of data in the standardized Air Force
HAZMAT tracking system. It has a finite length and number of characters.
DLA Class I ODS Defense Reserve—Only approved source of supply for Air Force Class I ODS usage
requirements. Requires AF Form 3952 authorization and Senior Acquisition Official (SAO) approval
from the HQ USAF HMMP team before DLA will process a requisition for a Class I ODS from the DLA
Class I ODS Defense Reserve.
Hazard Communication (HAZCOM)—The OSHA Hazard Communication Standard found in 29 CFR
1910.1200 requires supervisors to inform the workers they supervise of the occupational safety and heath
hazards of chemicals used in the workplace and the proper procedures and equipment to use to minimize
the risks of injury or sickness.
Hazardous Material (HAZMAT)—For purposes of this Air Force Instruction (AFI), the term HAZMAT
includes all items (including medical supply items with the exception of drugs in their finished form and
pharmaceuticals in individually-issued items) covered under the Emergency Planning and Community
Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) (or other host nation, federal, state, or local) reporting requirement, the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Hazard Communication (HAZCOM) Standard,
and all Class I and Class II Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS). It does not include munitions.
AFI32-7086_AFMCSUP1_I 10 APRIL 2006                                                                      79


Hazardous Material Management Process (HMMP)—A standard methodology used to manage and
track the procurement and use of HAZMAT to support Air Force missions, protect the safety and health of
personnel on Air Force installations and communities surrounding Air Force installations from misuse of
HAZMAT, minimize Air Force use of HAZMAT consistent with mission needs, and to maintain Air Force
compliance with environmental requirements for HAZMAT usage. The HMMP is composed of three
interdependent programs: the HAZMAT Pharmacy Program (IHMP), the Weapon System Hazardous
Material (HAZMAT) Program (WSHP), and the ODS Program (ODSP).
Hazardous Material Management Process (HMMP) teams—At each level (HQ USAF, MAJCOM,
and installations) the Environmental Protection Committee (EPC) or Environmental, Safety, and
Occupational Health Committee (ESOHC) chair will establish a cross-functional HMMP team. Civil
Engineering (CE) will lead the team. The HMMP team will report to the EPC or ESOHC chair. The
HMMP team will include, but is not limited to, representatives from CE (representing Environmental and
Fire), Maintenance (weapon systems), Logistics Readiness (with Supply expertise), Contracting, Surgeon
General (SG) (Bioenvironmental Engineering or BE), Safety (SE), Legal (JA), Communications and
Information (SC or CS), and the HAZMART supervisors. Other functional representatives such as
Finance, Requirements, Plans, Manpower, Public Affairs, HAZMAT users, and tenant organizations are
also members of the team, as required. Contracted functions may have contractor representation on the
HMMP team.
Hazardous Waste (HAZWASTE)—Any material subject to the hazardous waste manifest requirements
of Environmental Protection Agency specified in 40 CFR Part 262 and meets the definition in 40 CFR §
261.3 according to AFI 32-7042, Solid and Hazardous Waste Compliance.
HAZMART—A HAZMART is the “customer service desk” for the IHMP, and is the only entity on an
installation authorized to issue government-owned HAZMAT. At a minimum, a HAZMART is a facility
or location where customers can receive support for obtaining HAZMAT, and where HAZMAT are
managed and tracked. A HAZMART is intended to be the primary location on an installation where LRS
personnel stock, store, issue and distribute HAZMAT. Each installation must have at least one primary
HAZMART established by, and accountable to, the LRS commander. The HMMP team may designate
additional unit-controlled supply activities as HAZMARTs, performing all the functions of the primary
HAZMART. The HAZMART responsibilities include the receipt and entry of data on Government-wide
Purchase Card purchases of HAZMAT and the receipt and entry of data on contractor usage of HAZMAT.
Inadvertent Release—Unintended and unplanned releases. Inadvertent releases do not include releases
resulting from the intended use of the material (e.g., the release of halons in actual fire fighting or fuel
tank inerting).
Installation HAZMAT Management Program (IHMP)—An Air Force standardized program for
authorizing, procuring, issuing, and tracking of HAZMAT. This program was previously called the
HAZMAT Pharmacy Program (HPP).
Life Cycle—A series of stages or processes through which a system, product or entity passes from
inception to termination and disposal. It includes conception, design, development, testing, production,
deployment, training, maintenance, supply management, distribution, modification, and disposal/
demilitarization.
Life Cycle Analysis—The comprehensive examination of the environmental and economic effects of a
product or process throughout its lifetime including new material extraction, transportation,
manufacturing, operations, and ultimate disposal.

Medical Supply Items—Those items purchased through the Medical Dental Division of the Air Force
Working Capital Fund as required in AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual, Volume 5, Air Force
Medical Materiel Management System-General.
Ozone Depleting Substance (ODS)—Refers to Class I and Class II ODS, as defined by the Montreal
Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.
Partially Decentralized Operation—The operating concept of the IHMP. It consists of at least one
facility or location, known as a HAZMART, that serves as the “customer service desk” for the IHMP;
with the other IHMP activities (Bioenvironmental Engineering, Civil Engineering, Safety, Contracting,
Maintenance, and other, unit-controlled HAZMARTs, etc.) operating from their own organizations.
Process—A uniquely defined “unit of work” bounded by (1) ESOH regulatory drivers, and (2) hazard
recognition, evaluation, and control. Shops provide the TO number, title, page, and paragraph information
that identify the work “step” in an overall process. However, this information is captured only as a
"driver" for the identified process; TO “steps” are not the sole determinants in defining a process.
Process-specific Authorization—One of the two types of BE, SE, or CE approvals to authorize the use
of a given HAZMAT. Process-specific authorizations approve the use of a particular HAZMAT in a given
process in specified amounts.
Report Owner—Any organization requiring data from the HAZMAT data system to complete required
reports.
Recovered Material—Partially used, waste materials, and by-products recovered or diverted from solid
waste, excluding those materials and by-products generated from, and commonly reused within, an
original manufacturing process.
Recycle—The process that transforms recovered materials into new or usable products.
Requiring Document—The document that requires the use of the requested HAZMAT in a work area.
The requiring document will be a TO, owner/operator manual, work specification, or drawing.
Senior Acquisition Official (SAO)—The SAF/AQR, HQ USAF/ILE, HQ USAF/ILM, and HQ USAF/
ILG General Officer or civilian equivalents that provide centralized HQ USAF control of the ODSP.
These SAO offices also have the authority and responsibility for approving an ODS requirement based on
an ATR certification that there are no commercially available, technically and economically feasible
alternatives that do not increase the environment, safety, and occupational health risks and costs.
Single Manager (SM)—Single Manager (SM) is the Air Force term for the acquisition program manager
as defined in Department of Defense Directive 5000.1, Defense Acquisition. SMs are responsible for all
aspects of planning, development, sustainment, and evolution of the systems or products their program
offices acquire and support. The SM controls the weapon system technical data (e.g., Technical Order)
that establishes the requirement to use HAZMAT or ODS in a weapon system or a weapon system
maintenance process.
The Air Force has approximately 70 SMs, although this number will vary as the Air Force continues to
reorganize to improve efficiency and effectiveness. Program Management Directives (PMDs) identify the
SMs and funding sources and amounts for individual programs. SMs do not advocate for funding; that is
the responsibility of the MAJCOMs that employ the systems or products provided and supported by the
SMs. These MAJCOMs also define the cost, schedule, and performance requirements that the SMs must
meet.
AFI32-7086_AFMCSUP1_I 10 APRIL 2006                                                                       81


There are two types of Air Force SM. The first is the System Program Director (SPD). The SPD directs
Air Force System Program Offices (SPOs), and is ultimately responsible and accountable for decisions
and most resources in overall program execution of a military system. The SPD is accountable for the
cost, schedule, and performance (to include sustainment) of the program.
The second type of SM is the Product Group Manager (PGM). The PGM directs the acquisition activities
(to include sustainment) for a specific product group that supports one or more SPDs. The PGM is respon-
sible for decisions and resources and is accountable for the cost, schedule, and performance (to include
sustainment) of a specific product group.
A single Air Force weapon system may have multiple SMs who have responsibility for the cost, schedule,
performance (to include sustainment) of various components of the overall system. For instance, a typical
Air Force aircraft has a single SPD responsible for the airframe and overall integration of the aircraft sys-
tems. In addition, a typical Air Force aircraft will have several PGMs that provide "products" such as avi-
onics, engines, armaments, electronic counter measures, etc.
Total Ownership Cost (TOC)—The sum of all financial resources necessary to organize, equip, train,
sustain, and operate military forces sufficient to meet national goals in compliance with all laws and
policies applicable to DOD; all standards in effect for readiness, safety, and quality of life; and all other
official measures of performance. TOC is comprised of costs to research, develop, acquire, own, operate,
and dispose of weapon and support systems, other equipment and real property; the costs to recruit, train,
retain, separate and otherwise support military and civilian personnel; and all other costs of business
operations. For the purpose of the WSHP, TOC consists of the identifiable life-cycle costs that can be
assessed either qualitatively or quantitatively in support of comparisons between various alternatives for
making a recommended TO or hardware change. At the installation level, the identifiable costs will be
limited to operational, sustainment, training, and disposal costs. MAJCOMs, working with the program
offices, will provide greater life cycle cost fidelity, as necessary, to make decisions on whether to proceed
with a candidate process or on which alternative should be implemented.
User—Anyone or any organization utilizing hazardous material in the performance of their Air Force
mission.
Weapon System—A combination of elements that function together to produce the capabilities required
to fulfill a mission need, including hardware, equipment, software, and all Integrated Logistics Support
elements, but excluding construction or other improvements to real property.
Weapon System Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) Program (WSHP)—Describes how MAJCOM
and installation HMMP teams can identify needs for weapon system-driven HAZMAT reductions within
the existing weapon system requirements identification, prioritization, funding and execution processes.
Weapon System Process Usage List—The quantity of HAZMAT used in each weapon system process.
Work Area—A definable location where personnel perform work. This can be outdoors (e.g., an aircraft
trim pad) or indoor; administrative or industrial; or any installation-level location where a hazardous
material is used in the performance of a specific process. Synonymous with work center.

84                                                     AFI32-7086_AFMCSUP1_I 10 APRIL 2006


        13. UNIT OF ISSUE–Normally defined by the NSN or LSN.
        14. DRAW AMOUNT— The quantity of a HAZMAT (expressed as a multiple of the Unit of
            Issue in Block 13) authorized for issue to the work area during each period specified in
            Block 15 (Draw Frequency). The work area should propose a Draw Amount and a Draw
            Frequency that is based upon the Amount of Material Used Per Process and the Process
            Frequency entered in Blocks 19 and 20. For example, a shop may need to use 5 quarts of
            oil each time it performs an oil change on a fleet vehicle, which it does approximately once
            per month. The shop would enter “5 quarts” in Block 19 and “once per month” in Block
            20. If the work area wanted to get the product from the HAZMART only quarterly and had
            the facilities to properly store a 3-month supply, it could specify a quarterly draw amount
            of 15 quarts. The appropriate entry for the Draw Amount (Block 14) would be "15 quarts,"
            and the Draw Frequency (BLOCK 15) would be "per quarter."
        15. DRAW FREQUENCY—How often does the requestor need to obtain the identified Draw
            Amount of the HAZMAT (set to keep minimum essential amounts in the shop). For a more
            detailed explanation see the directions for Block 14, above. If this is a non-recurring
            requirement, enter "One-time only."


     SECTION III. REQUIRING DOCUMENTS—Complete items 16a through 16e. Identify the jus-
     tification documents that require the use of the requested HAZMAT in the work area process
     described in Section IV. Typically, the requiring document will be a Technical Order (TO), owner/
     operator manual, work specification, or drawing. Attach a copy of the specified pages from the
     requiring document. For TOs, provide the TO number, figure, index, relevant paragraph, page,
     change number, and change date. For other justification documents, provide the equivalent infor-
     mation. NOTE: In the absence of a requiring document, AF Form 3952 authorizing offices will
     require the use of the least hazardous available material.
        16a. DOCUMENT NUMBER—Specify TO, MILSPEC, or commercial manual.
        16b. PARAGRAPH NUMBER—Relevant paragraph requiring use of HAZMAT.
        16c. PAGE NUMBER—Relevant page number requiring use of HAZMAT.
        16d. REVISION/CHANGE—Enter the latest change number for the entire document, not the
             change number (if any) on the page containing the HAZMAT call-out.
        16e. REVISION/CHANGE DATE— Enter the latest change date for the entire document, not
             the change number (if any) on the page containing the HAZMAT call-out.


     SECTION IV. PROCESS INFORMATION—Complete items 17 through 23.
        17. IS THIS REQUEST FOR A NEW WORKLOAD OR PROCESS IN THIS SHOP?
            Self-explanatory.
        17a WILL THIS REPLACE ANOTHER AUTHORIZATION (DIFFERENT MATERIAL OR
            PROCESS)? If so, specify the existing authorization number and reason for change?
        18. PROCESS--A description of the process in which the requestor plans to use the HAZMAT
            in question in the work area described in Section I. This requestor may provide this by ref-
AFI32-7086_AFMCSUP1_I 10 APRIL 2006                                                                    85


           erence to the Section III requiring document page and paragraph number, if copies of those
           sections are included with the 3952 submittal. Be sure to provide the following informa-
           tion:
           i. Application method, including but not limited to: hand, brush, spray, spatula/putty
           knife, cloth, roller, dipping, pouring, squeeze bottle, hose, spray gun/nozzle, and vapor
           condensation.
           ii. Type of industrial equipment, such as open tanks, closed tanks, vapor degreaser, spray
           booth, mechanical equipment, or liquid-tight equipment (closed system) in which the
           HAZMAT will be used.
           iii. If the process involves transferring HAZMAT to industrial equipment, list the
           equipment number and specify whether the transfer will occur by pouring, pumping, or
           another method.
           iv. Method by which the HAZMAT will be or has been mixed (hand; mixer, open
           container; mixer, closed container, etc.), heated (oven, soldering iron, torch, etc.), or
           abraded (wire brush, sander, grinder, etc.).
        19. AMOUNT OF MATERIAL USED PER PROCESS—This amount is different from, but
            related to, the DRAW AMOUNT in Block 14. For example, if the process is to change the
            5 quarts of oil in a motor vehicle, then a user wishing to change the oil in three vehicles
            would draw 15 quarts of oil (BLOCK 14), but use only 5 quarts per individual process (per
            vehicle). Therefore, enter “5 quarts” in this block. See the instructions at Block 14 for a
            more detailed discussion of the relationship between the entries in Blocks 14, 15, 19 and
            20.
        20. FREQUENCY OF PROCESS—How often the process is performed. Example: If a work
            area has to change the oil in one of its vehicles approximately once per month, so state. If
            this is a non-recurring (one-time) requirement, enter "One-time only." NOTE: Blocks 12
            and 13 should be consistent with the data in Blocks 19 and 20. If these two sets of data are
            not consistent, the AF Form 3952 should be rejected until this can be resolved. See the
            instructions at Block 14 for a more detailed discussion of the relationship between the
            entries in Blocks 14, 15, 19 and 20.
        21. DURATION OF PROCESS—How long it takes to complete the process one time.
        22. DESCRIBE ANY ENGINEERING CONTROLS IN USE DURING THE PROCESS—
            Such as exhaust/ventilation systems, enclosures, covered tanks, cooling coils, etc.
        23. INDICATE ANY PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE) CURRENTLY
            BEING USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS PROCESS—List any PPE used while
            performing this process. Include eye, face, body, foot, and hand protection; and manufac-
            turer and model number for both respirator and cartridge.
        24. DESCRIBE THE METHOD OF DISPOSAL FOR THE WASTE THAT IS GENER-
            ATED—Typical responses include, but are not limited to: totally consumed in use, par-
            tially consumed in use, recycled on-site, recycled off-site, drummed/containerized,
            sanitary sewer, storm sewer, industrial drain, bulk, and air emission. NOTE: "returned to
            DLA Class I ODS Defense Reserve" is mandatory for all Class I ODS refrigerants and
            halons. Class I ODS solvents are normally disposed of as hazardous waste.

       SECTION V. REMARKS
           25. PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION—Optional. If this is a revision to an existing
               AF Form 3952 (See Block 1), identity the blocks that have changed and what has changed
               in those blocks (i.e. "changed from __/to __")


       SECTION VI. CERTIFICATION—Complete items 24 through 29
           26a. REQUESTOR’S NAME, ORGN SYMBOL, AND PHONE—For the individual per
                forming the process.
           26b. SIGNATURE—Electronic or hardcopy.
           26c. DATE—Date requestor signed document.
           27a. CERTIFYING OFFICIAL’S NAME, ORGN SYMBOL, AND PHONE—Work area
                supervisor who certifies that the material is required for use in the work area process
                described in Section IV and IAW the requiring document specified in Section III. NOTE:
                This person must be able to validate the requirement and ensure the workers using the
                requested HAZMAT have the proper training and equipment to safely use the requested
                HAZMAT,
           27b. SIGNATURE—Electronic or hardcopy.
           27c. DATE—Date certifying official signed document.


B. Part II—Material Authorization: Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE), Safety (SE), and Civil Engi-
neering (CE) offices must review Part I of each AF Form 3952 and complete part II. All three offices must
authorize the use of the requested HAZMAT in the process specified in Part I before a work area represen-
tative may obtain the HAZMAT for use in that process. The only exception to this process-specific autho-
rization requirement is when BE, SE, or CE have approved a blanket authorization to use a HAZMAT,
packaged in a specific size container, in any process.


       Section I. HEALTH REVIEW. BE will evaluate Part I of AF Form 3952 and document in Part II,
       Section I of AF Form 3952 health risks and control options and authorize requested HAZMAT
       use, as appropriate. Reviews will include, and remarks may reference, HAZMAT-related work
       area surveys.


       The BE office must select one of the four checkboxes:
       1. Blanket Authorized
       2. Authorized with the restrictions listed in Part 1 Section IV, and those listed below (if any)
       3. Not authorized
AFI32-7086_AFMCSUP1_I 10 APRIL 2006                                                                   87


     4. Contractor Submitted 3952--reviewed for information purposes only (this does not involve
     evaluation and approval of the contractor’s safety and health programs)


     For box 2, any requirements beyond those listed in Part 1 Section IV should be listed in the
     Remarks Section. If necessary, the Remarks section should highlight the major concerns such as
     mandatory requirements for engineering controls and/or personal protective equipment (PPE).
     This information will provide employees with information to effectively manage risk related to
     potential occupational hazards. If box 3 is marked and the AF Form 3952 is not authorized, the BE
     must discuss in the remarks section the rationale for rejection. For contractor AF Form 3952, the
     BE may wish to identifying potential health risks to non-contractor personnel and resources and
     advise CE and the Contracting Office on how to mitigate identified hazards from planned contrac-
     tor HAZMAT usage.


     Section II. SAFETY REVIEW. SE will evaluate Part I of AF Form 3952 and document in Part II,
     Section II of AF Form 3952 safety risks and control options and authorize requested HAZMAT
     use, as appropriate. Reviews will include, and remarks may reference, HAZMAT-related work
     area safety surveys.


     The SE office must select one of the four checkboxes:
     1. Blanket Authorized
     2. Authorized with the restrictions listed in Part 1 Section IV, and those listed below
     3. Not authorized
     4. Contractor Submitted 3952--reviewed for information purposes only (this does not involve
     evaluation and approval of the contractor’s safety and health programs)


     Unless Box 1 is checked, the SE reviewer must complete the Remarks block, regardless of
     whether or not an MSDS is attached. For non-contractor AF Form 3952 that are being authorized,
     the Remarks block should highlight only the major concerns, which may or may not be identified
     in the MSDS, in order to provide employees using the HAZMAT with information pertinent to
     their safety and health. These concerns may include chemical reactivity (conditions to avoid); PPE
     not identified in the health review or in addition to the PPE identified on the front of AF Form
     3952 such as aprons, boots, gloves, etc., as required; recommended first aid treatment in the event
     of over-exposure; or applicable restrictions during use. If the AF Form 3952 is not authorized, the
     SE reviewer should discuss in the remarks section the rationale for rejection. For contractor AF
     Form 3952, the SE should identify in this section potential health risks to non-contractor personnel
     and resources and advise CE and the Contracting Office on how to mitigate identified hazards
     from planned contractor HAZMAT usage.


     Section III. ENVIRONMENTAL AND FIRE PROTECTION REVIEW. CE will evaluate Part I
     of AF Form 3952 and document in Part II, Section III of AF Form 3952 environmental require-
88                                                      AFI32-7086_AFMCSUP1_I 10 APRIL 2006


     ments and control options, and fire protection and emergency response requirements. Reviews
     will include HAZMAT-related work area surveys of such items as environmental controls, envi-
     ronmental permits, disposal restrictions, fire protection concerns, and ozone depleting substance
     approvals.


     The CE office must select one of the three checkboxes:
     1. Blanket Authorization
     2. Authorized with the restrictions listed in Part 1 Section IV, and those listed below (if any)
     3. Not authorized


     For Box 2 any requirements beyond those listed in Part 1 Section IV should be listed in the
     Remarks Section to provide employees using the HAZMAT information pertinent to environmen-
     tal protection. If box 3 is marked and the AF Form 3952 is not authorized, the BE must discuss in
     the remarks section the rationale for rejection. The CE office must also specify the Senior Acqui-
     sition Official (SAO) approval number if the AF Form 3952 request is for contractor usage of a
     Class I ODS. Since CE is the only authorizing office that can approve or disapprove an AF Form
     3952 submitted by a contractor, CE must include in this section an assessment of whether the
     authorized contractor HAZMAT usage may cause violations of environmental compliance
     requirements or create health and safety (including fire protection) hazards (based on the BE, SE,
     and Fire Protection inputs).

Section I
Except for Blocks 1 and 2, the Requiring Activity (RA) must complete Section I. The RA must also com-
plete Block 33, Requiring Document Information, of Section II in order to identify the Appropriate Tech-
nical Representative (ATR) for each separate ODS requirement in a given contract. The ATR is the office
that owns the Requiring Document for a given ODS requirement. NOTE: the alpha designations for
Blocks 17-25 in Section I are directly linked to the alpha designations for Block 33-36 in Section II. Thus,
the requiring document identified in Block 33A is the document that requires the use of the ODS identi-
fied in Block 17A in the process identified in Block 18A. The ATR for the ODS and process identified in
Blocks 17A and 18A is shown in Block 35A and is the office that owns the requiring document shown in
Block 33A.

Section II
The Appropriate Technical Representative (ATR) should complete Section. However, the RA must com-
plete Block 33, Requiring Document Information, of Section II in order to be able to identify the ATR for
each separate ODS requirement in a given contract. The ATR is the office that owns the Requiring Docu-

directly linked to the alpha designations for Block 33-36 in Section II. Thus, the requiring document iden-
tified in Block 33A is the document that requires the use of the ODS identified in Block 17A in the pro-
cess identified in Block 18A. The ATR for the ODS and process identified in Blocks 17A and 18A is
shown in Block 35A and is the office that owns the requiring document shown in Block 33A.


In the SAO approval process, the Air Force single manager with engineering authority over the system,
sub-system, or support system provides the ATR certification for the Class I ODS requirements in that
system, sub-system, or support system. Each SAO approval must include the certification of at least one
Appropriate Technical Representative (ATR) stating no economically and technically feasible substitute
exists for the specific Class I ODS requirement. Unless the contract is a single manager contract, this
means that the Requiring Activity, which completes Section I, will be different from the ATR, which com-
pletes Section II. Contracts that require the use of Class I ODS in different processes controlled by differ-
ent single managers will require ATR certifications from the different single manager offices. Call SAF/
AQRE at DSN 426-8539 for assistance in routing this form to the correct ATRs.
