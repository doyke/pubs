   1.3.1. Each ALC will develop local procedures that will, as a minimum, meet the requirements of this
   instruction. (NOTE: Local directives will be developed or updated for implementation within 180
   days from the publication of this instruction). Operating instructions will provide specific procedures
   for the following:
       1.3.1.1. Processing, controlling, and accomplishing support of depot maintenance equipment and
       facilities through the Industrial Services Division.
       1.3.1.2. Determining requirements, monitoring, and accomplishing preventive, corrective and
       predictive maintenance for depot equipment.
       1.3.1.3. Developing plans and performing Industrial Services Division functions.

1.4. Categories of Industrial Services Division Work.
   1.4.1. Work performed by the Industrial Services Division falls into the following general categories:
   1.4.2. Repair. Work normally generated as a result of utility, facility, or equipment failures. The
   Industrial Services Division (MAD) will operate a trouble call desk for the receipt and processing of
   emergency repair work on nonreal property. Instructions on repair work are included in Chapter 2.
   1.4.3. Project Work. Work resulting from management planning efforts. Examples of typical
   project-type workloads include the installation of new equipment and relocation of a production shop.
   The planning, scheduling, and control functions will receive and process requests for this type of work
   according to Chapter 3.
   1.4.4. Preventive and Predictive Maintenance. Work planned and performed to protect the capability
   of equipment by removing the cause of failure and making adjustments for normal wear before failure
   occurs. This work is performed on a predetermined time schedule according to the instructions con-
   tained in Chapter 2.
   1.4.5. Direct Product. Work normally resulting from a requirement of a MAD customer for skills
   peculiar to the Industrial Services Division. When this occurs, procedures applicable to the direct pro-
   duction activity will apply to the Industrial Services Division resources involved. A direct production
   Resource Control Center (RCC) may be established in the Industrial Services Division where it per-
   mits the most efficient use of skills and directorate resources.

1.5. Relationship to BCE (Work Accomplishment).
   1.5.1. Industrial Services Division versus BCE responsibilities. (see Figure 1.1). Availability of
   resources may drive changes to BCE and Industrial Services Division responsibilities listed in Figure
   1.1. A local memorandum of agreement will be developed to reflect these changes.
   1.5.2. BCE’s Mission and Function Statement. BCE is responsible for maintaining real property,
   roads and grounds, real property installed equipment (RPIE), and utilities. Real property facilities and
   equipment are defined as lands, buildings, structures, utility systems, improvements and accessories
   as accounted for in real property records. The BCE obtains project approval, executes facility projects,
   establishes and maintains programs to prevent real property deterioration, develops and conducts a
   facilities and infrastructure maintenance and operations program based on mission requirements and
   cost effectiveness.

NOTES:
X indicates the office of primary responsibility (OPR).
C indicates OPR, but BCE coordination/support required prior to Industrial Services performing work.
Local coordination procedures will be jointly determined by Industrial Services BCE. The OPR for C*
tasks may vary based on the extent and/or nature of the work. These areas are negotiated if the OPR is not
clear. This listing of MAD responsibilities versus BCE responsibilities was modified to require additional
coordination. This increased coordination will protect utility systems from overload and help to maintain
the structural integrity of real property.

1.7. Interpretation of Utility Tasks:
   1.7.1. Electrical, less than 600 volts. MAD will maintain all branch circuits within a production divi-
   sion occupied facility from power distribution panel or bussway to non-RPIE utilization equipment.
   BCE will be responsible for power supply and electrical components to the first buss switch on the
   main distribution service and all electrical installations to RPIE. BCE will make all connections to the
   supply point in electrical vaults for RPIE and non-RPIE, unless approval is granted to MAD through
   an AF IMT 332, Base Civil Engineer Work Request.

    1.7.2. Electrical, greater than 600 volts. BCE will be responsible for maintenance and repair of all
    power supply, electrical equipment and connections to RPIE as well as non-RPIE.
    1.7.3. Potable Water Systems. BCE will be responsible for maintenance and repair of the systems to
    be used for personnel and sanitary installations as well as the supply and complete distribution system
    up to and including the backflow preventing device at the service connection to all process and
    non-RPIE industrial systems. (Fire water supply and distribution systems are BCE responsibility.)
    1.7.4. Chilled Water and Hot Water Systems. Chilled water and hot water systems are considered util-
    ity systems if any part of either system is being utilized for “creature comfort” or other RPIE support.
    As a utility, BCE will be responsible to maintain the chilled water plant or boiler plant supply and
    return piping main loop as well as all RPIE support secondary distribution systems. Process and other
    non-RPIE hot or chilled water supply and return DIPE systems will be maintained by the MAD from
    the service connection at the supply main to the service connection at the return main or first valve
    installation in service loop if no disconnecting means is available at the service connection. The
    chilled water will be of such a quality that it meets a maximum standard of 45 degree dew point with
    a particulate of 5 micron or less at point of use.
    1.7.5. Steam and Condensate Return, Natural Gas, and Compressed Air. All plant and main distribu-
    tion systems are the responsibility of the BCE. Secondary branch systems to support non-RPIE will be
    maintained by MAD from the service connection at the main distribution system (or closest valve in
    the branch line if no service disconnect is available) to the non-RPIE or utilization process. BCE will
    make all connections to the source of supply. The compressed air will be of such a quality that it meets
    a minimum standard of 32 degree dew point with a particulate of 5 micron or less at point of use.
    1.7.6. Industrial Gases (argon, hydrogen, nitrogen, etc.) and High Compressed Air. All plants, storage
    reservoirs, DIPE systems, gauges, etc. will be maintained by MAD.
    1.7.7. Waste Water Collection Systems. BCE will be responsible for all collection systems supporting
    sanitary or personnel comfort facilities as well as RPIE producing waste water from point source to
    disposal plant. Waste water from non-RPIE or industrial process discharge sources will be conveyed
    by process piping or other means to the BCE industrial waste collection system. MAD will be respon-
    sible to maintain the non-RPIE waste water conveying systems from its source to the nearest floor
    drain, sump or lift station wet well. These latter locations are collection points for the BCE industrial
    sewage systems. Below grade sumps that have no gravity drain connection to the industrial waste sys-
    tem and collect waste water from non-RPIE sources only will be considered the same as floor drains
    and will be maintained by the BCE. Small waste water forwarding pumps (1 horsepower or less) com-
    plete with discharge piping, valves, fittings and controls as required to service these small pumps will
    consequently be included as a part of the conveyance system and will be a MAD responsibility. BCE
    will be informed by process owners within MA anytime a change in production processes will result
    in increased volume of waste collection.
    1.7.8. Storm Water Collection System. Maintenance of storm drains is a BCE responsibility. No
    other than nonpolluted run off flows from rain water shall be conveyed to the storm water collection
    system. Oil-water separators in the storm water systems will be maintained and repaired by BCE.
    1.7.9. Irrigation Sprinkler Systems. Maintenance and repair of automatically or manually controlled
    irrigation and sprinkler systems is a BCE responsibility and as RPIE will be a part of landscaping.
    1.7.10. Newly-Constructed Facilities and Substantial Additions or Alterations to Existing Facilities.
    MXD will be notified when BCE has accepted the formal issuance of a certification of beneficial
AFMCI21-127 23 JUNE 2005                                                                               9


  occupancy. Prior to occupying a new facility, MAD and BCE will meet to confirm all BCE responsi-
  ble equipment and MAD responsible equipment (IOE). When responsibility is determined, MAD and
  BCE will install a tag on their identified equipment to indicate recognition of their maintenance
  responsibility. BCE will turn over to the MAD representative all operator maintenance (OM) manuals,
  spare parts lists, drawings, start-up instruction, etc., for industrial equipment which are provided by
  the contractor as a requirement of the construction contract. To assure that warranty conditions are
  properly satisfied, it is imperative that BCE promptly surrenders all non-RPIE PM and OM data to
  MAD and timely arranges for the preoccupation meeting with MAD representatives.Chapter 2

                                                Chapter 2

                                    EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE

2.1. Maintenance Concept.
     2.1.1. This chapter provides guidance for maintenance procedures and practices to ensure reliability
     and mission support capability of Depot Industrial Plant Equipment (DIPE) and non-DIPE.

2.2. Maintenance Program Determination.
     2.2.1. Types of Equipment. The Industrial Services Division, with the aid of the Production Divi-
     sions, determines which equipment requires specific operator maintenance (OM) and the equipment
     to be included in the preventive maintenance (PM) and predictive maintenance (PDM) programs man-
     aged by Industrial Services. Equipment such as bench grinders, bench drill presses, etc, generally
     requires only OM because of its simplicity and intermittent use. Equipment such as numerically-con-
     trolled machine tools, lathes, milling machines, boring machines, surface grinders, breathing air sys-
     tems, hoists test stands, etc., must be capable of producing to specific tolerances, normally requires
     specific PM or PDM, in addition to OM.
        2.2.1.1. DIPE is defined as permanently affixed/fixed location equipment not readily movable or
        other equipment as determined by Industrial Services Equipment Specialists and local operating
        instructions. DIPE is used for, but not limited to cutting, abrading, grinding, shaping, forming,
        joining, testing, measuring, heating, treating, or otherwise altering the physical, electrical, or
        chemical properties of materials, components, or end items, entailed in manufacturing, mainte-
        nance, supply, processing, and assembly operations. Industrial equipment such as material con-
        veyance systems, process compressed air and vacuum systems, specialized industrial gas systems,
        hoists/bridge cranes, and breathing air systems may be included. DIPE will be identified with an
        Industrial Services Division identification number in accordance with (IAW) paragraph 0 of this
        document.
        2.2.1.2. Non-DIPE support equipment will be defined IAW paragraph 0of this document.
        Non-DIPE will include all equipment required to perform support functions except when it is, or
        becomes, an integral part of mission equipment. Support Equipment (SE) does not include any
        equipment required to perform mission operation functions. SE will include test equipment and
        automatic test equipment (when it accomplishes a support function), field and depot SE, and
        related computer programs and software. Support equipment includes the following major catego-
        ries:
            2.2.1.2.1. Direct Support Equipment (DSE).
            2.2.1.2.2. Powered and non-powered Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE).
        2.2.1.3. 3400 Series Machinery and Shop Equipment
            2.2.1.3.1. Equipment which does not require specific OM, specific servicing inspections, or
            for which technical data does not exist will be tagged with condition status tags, IAW Techni-
            cal Order (TO) 34-1-3, Inspection and Maintenance of Machinery and Shop Equipment, and
            TO 00-20-3, Maintenance Process of Reparable Property and the Repair Cycle Asset Control
            System. Examples of this class of machinery and shop equipment include small bench grinders
AFMCI21-127 23 JUNE 2005                                                                                11


          and buffers, drill presses or other equipment that requires only On Condition Maintenance
          (OCM).
   2.2.2. Maintenance Program Criteria. The following criteria will be applied to determine if equip-
   ment will be included in the maintenance management PM or PDM program.
      2.2.2.1. Equipment creating an unsafe or hazardous environment if failure occurred, due to lack of
      PM or PDM, will be included.
      2.2.2.2. All weapon peculiar equipment having specific PM requirements delineated by an appli-
      cable TO will be included.
      2.2.2.3. Equipment subject to breakdown repairs that are expensive compared to PM or PDM will
      be included.
      2.2.2.4. Equipment critical to production and where failure would result in costly downtime will
      be included.
      2.2.2.5. Equipment not critical to the depot maintenance process (e.g., small drill press) and can
      be repaired without regard to downtime or equipment availability should be excluded.
      2.2.2.6. Equipment of small dollar value, where the cost of PM or PDM is likely to exceed the
      cost of replacement upon failure, should be excluded.

2.3. Maintenance Process.
   2.3.1. Preventive Maintenance (PM):
      2.3.1.1. PM is the normal upkeep and preservation of equipment through systematic inspection,
      detection and correction of discrepancies to prevent failures, to verify serviceability, or restore
      complete-serviceability of equipment that has been subjected to usage, wear and tear, or deteriora-
      tion caused by environmental elements. It is performed on a periodic basis, according to a specific
      set of instructions and a predetermined time schedule and includes such actions as locating and
      correcting minor vibrations or tool chatter, adjusting or replacing drive belts, accomplishing lubri-
      cation requirements, making adjustments in gibs, bearings, and lead screws, and leveling of
      machines.
      2.3.1.2. Perform preventive maintenance for Industrial Services maintained equipment IAW
      locally developed procedures.
      2.3.1.3. PM Frequency. PM inspections should be spaced as far apart as possible to reduce cost,
      yet, stay within safe time limits during which defects do not ordinarily develop to the point of
      needing attention. Use the following sources to establish PM frequencies:
          2.3.1.3.1. Technical Orders (TO). Follow TO prescribed frequencies when weapon system
          peculiar equipment is covered by a TO, unless written approval is obtained to adjust the
          requirement.
          2.3.1.3.2. Manufacturer’s Recommendations. These normally assume a high degree of use;
          that is, eight or more hours per workday. Estimated usage rates will be used to compensate for
          the less than high use rates to preclude unnecessary PM costs.
          2.3.1.3.3. Judgment. In the absence of other sources, judgment based on similar pieces of
          equipment should be applied.
12                                                                         AFMCI21-127 23 JUNE 2005


           2.3.1.3.4. Historical Data. Historical maintenance data may indicate the need to adjust PM
           frequencies. If frequent repair is required, increased PM may be justified. Conversely, lack of
           repair may indicate the PM frequencies should be reduced. Repair data is maintained on the
           AFMC IMT 388, Machine Tool and Equipment Historical Record, or in the Computerized
           Maintenance Management System (CMMS).
        2.3.1.4. The PM is overdue when the original PM due date has been exceeded.
        2.3.1.5. The PM is past due when the original PM due date has been exceeded by one frequency
        cycle or 60 days, whichever is less. Equipment with past due PM must be taken out of service by
        production shop personnel in coordination with Industrial Services maintenance personnel.
        2.3.1.6. The Industrial Services equipment specialists prepare PM instructions, which are
        reflected on AFMC IMTs 306, Preventative Maintenance Instruction, or computer generated
        equivalent. A Work Authorization Document (WAD) may be used in lieu of AFMC IMTs 306 and
        is not required to be attached to the equipment. The WAD should contain the PM number, due
        date, next due date and minimum interval of inspection for the specified equipment.
        2.3.1.7. Use the following sources to establish PM Instructions:
           2.3.1.7.1. Maintenance Technical Orders. Follow the prescribed periodic maintenance instruc-
           tions when weapon system peculiar equipment is covered by a TO.
           2.3.1.7.2. Manufacturer’s Recommendations. Commercial operating manuals, data, or speci-
           fications will be used to determine PM instructions if no Maintenance Technical Orders exist
           or are no longer applicable due to approved modifications that have been done to the equip-
           ment and the maintenance TO updates have not been received.
           2.3.1.7.3. Judgment/Historical Data. For equipment that has no tech data available containing
           PM instructions, judgment based on experience or similar equipment historical data may be
           used to document PM instructions.
     2.3.2. Predictive Maintenance (PDM):
        2.3.2.1. Predictive maintenance is the process of using electrical and mechanical testing and diag-
        nostic devices to predict when a piece of equipment is deviating from its normal operating param-
        eters. It is designed to protect equipment capability and investment by removing causes of failure
        and making adjustment to compensate for normal wear before failure or an unsafe condition
        occurs. Predictive maintenance technology may aid in optimizing PM frequencies by utilizing
        data trends.
        2.3.2.2. Perform PDM for Industrial Services maintained equipment.
     2.3.3. Corrective Maintenance (CM):
        2.3.3.1. CM is the unscheduled repair or service of equipment to verify serviceability, or to restore
        complete serviceability of equipment that has been subjected to usage, wear and tear, component
        failure or deterioration caused by environmental elements. It is performed on a customer demand
        basis.
        2.3.3.2. Industrial Services Division will perform CM IAW locally developed procedures.
     2.3.4. Operator Maintenance:
AFMCI21-127 23 JUNE 2005                                                                               13


      2.3.4.1. OM requirements are documented and maintained with the equipment or are readily
      accessible. They will include, as a minimum, the nomenclature of the equipment, equipment iden-
      tification number, frequency of maintenance action, and the actions required. Maintenance per-
      formed by the equipment operator falls into one of the following categories.
          2.3.4.1.1. General OM. Applies to all equipment to ensure serviceability and safety of the
          equipment prior to use. It consists of a review of equipment documentation for current status
          and a visual inspection of the equipment for defects, adequate servicing and general state of
          cleanliness.
          2.3.4.1.2. On Condition Maintenance (OCM). This type of maintenance generally applies to
          equipment that does not have any published technical data requiring specific inspections. It
          may also apply to less costly and less complex equipment whereby the cost of scheduled PM
          is not feasible and only requires general OM. Equipment of this type may be repaired by
          Industrial Services personnel, as required. Documentation will be IAW TO 34-1-3, Inspection
          and Maintenance of Machinery and Shop Equipment.
          2.3.4.1.3. Specific OM. This is equipment maintenance or inspection of a specific nature as
          identified on AFMC IMT 306, Preventative Maintenance Instructions or equivalent and per-
          formed by the owning organization/operator. The AFMC IMT 306 must be attached to the
          equipment or in a readily accessible location. These instructions will include OM of a critical
          nature that, if neglected, could result in costly equipment damage or create an unsafe condition
          for shop personnel.
      2.3.4.2. Using organizations preparing internal preventive maintenance instructions may utilize
      the AFMC IMT 306 to identify these inspections. Using organizations will identify on the AFMC
      IMT 306 all organizational inspections.

2.4. Maintenance Initiation:
   2.4.1. Production shop personnel in coordination with Industrial Services maintenance personnel will
   lockout/tagout the DIPE based on any safety hazard. This will be accomplished IAW AFOSH STD
   91-501 and local directives.
      2.4.1.1. Requesting organization will provide the following information when contacting the
      maintenance organization for repairs.
      2.4.1.2. Status of the equipment (operational or inoperative).
      2.4.1.3. Type or nature of repair service required.
      2.4.1.4. Equipment type and the equipment identification number.
      2.4.1.5. Justification to establish priority code IAW paragraph 2.5.1.1.
      2.4.1.6. Name of the reporting individual.
      2.4.1.7. Equipment location including building number, post or room number, shop name, shop
      RCC, and any other pertinent information.
      2.4.1.8. Name and telephone number of requesting organization, point of contact, and alternate to
      be contacted at repair site.

           4.3.1.3.1. All labor standards with current workload will be reviewed yearly. If an inactive
           standard is observed, the standard shall be deleted.
           4.3.1.3.2. The planner develops and maintains an active labor standard file that contains sup-
           porting and backup data for the labor standard. Documentation requirements for engineered
           standards are identified in AFMCI 21-105, Atch 5. Non-engineered standards should include
           all available documentation (minimum requirements are identified in AFMCI 21-105, para-
           graph 3.4.4.).
     4.3.2. Laboratory Planning.
        4.3.2.1. The planner will assist and coordinate on new or transferring workloads that require
        MADL laboratories support.
        4.3.2.2. The planner shall process the appropriate documentation for all new or renewing work-
        load.
           4.3.2.2.1. The planner will evaluate the status of laboratory workload for new or existing
           requirements. If it is a new requirement the Planner will assign an operation number.
           4.3.2.2.2. The planner will input labor hour information into the E046B, Labor Standard
           Mechanization System for new requirements and update the system for existing requirements.
           4.3.2.2.3. The planner will obtain applicable laboratory supervisors, section supervisor and
           branch chief coordination on labor standard review documentation for new requirements. The
           Planner will obtain applicable section supervisor signature on labor standard review documen-
           tation on existing requirements. If there is a change to the labor hours the planner will obtain
           the applicable laboratory supervisors coordination.
           4.3.2.2.4. The planner will maintain a file folder containing a copy of labor standard review
           documentation for new requirements and a copy of the labor standard review documentation
           for existing requirements, Temporary Job Request.
        4.3.2.3. The planner will perform the following planning operations upon receipt of all, AFMC
        IMT 206’s:
           4.3.2.3.1. Verify Schedulers Code, Planners Code, Funds, Job Order Quantity and Need Date
           are all correct upon receiving the Statement of Work (SOW) or special instructions with an
           assigned Temporary Job Order Number from the Financial Management Branch work loader.
           4.3.2.3.2. Review all work requests for referenced technical data/specifications for shortfalls
           such as peculiar tools/equipment, skills, special processes, and confer with appropriate labora-
           tory supervisor and scheduler to verify organizational capability for total performance as
           required.
           4.3.2.3.3. All initially identified deficiencies will be addressed with the initiator for corrective
           action and/or work statement modification prior to opening actions in G004L. Lack of
           required/proper skills documentation will be obtained from the appropriate laboratory supervi-
           sor in writing. These attempts, verbally and/or written, should be documented and kept in a
           planning folder until final cancellation is completed and/or changes/corrective actions are
           received for final processing action.

            flight or section chief should require an OWC technician familiar with the equipment to
            accompany the equipment to and remain at the PMEL to provide technical assistance until the
            equipment is completed or placed in an interim complete status. The owning/using organiza-
            tion will pick up the items immediately upon notification of completion.
            7.7.3.6.2. Priority - One-of-a-kind or one-deep TMDE that is part of a unit’s deployment
            package or is critical to daily peacetime operations, and any TMDE for which a critical quan-
            tity has become unavailable for use. A letter of justification signed by the OWC flight chief (or
            equivalent) will accompany the equipment. The OWC flight chief (or equivalent) should
            pre-identify by letter TMDE that meets the mission essential definition as approved by the
            TMDE flight chief or delegated approval authority. PMEL must accept mission essential
            equipment any time during duty hours and schedule it as the next item into work with the
            equipment worked by all shifts until calibration or repair is completed or status of the item
            changes. The owning/using organization will pick up the item immediately upon notification
            of completion.
            7.7.3.6.3. Routine - TMDE not categorized as emergency or mission essential. PMEL must
            accept routine equipment during normal turn-in/pick up hours.
