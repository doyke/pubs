1.3. Phases of Training:
     1.3.1. Initial Qualification Training (IQT). This training is necessary to qualify aircrew
     for duties in a sailplane. See Chapter 2 for IQT program requirements.
     1.3.2. Mission Qualification Training (MQT). This training is necessary to qualify
     aircrew for the unit’s mission or local area requirements. This training may be incorporated
     in MAJCOM-approved IQT syllabi. See Chapter 3 for MQT program requirements.
     1.3.3. Continuation Training (CT). This training is necessary for qualified aircrew to
     maintain their level of proficiency, increase flight certifications, and develop as instructors. It
     provides minimum ground and flight training requirements. See Chapter 4 for CT program
     requirements. Squadron commanders certify pilots as experienced or inexperienced in
     accordance with the definitions in Attachment 1.
     1.3.4. Specialized Training. This training is necessary to carry out the unit’s assigned
     missions but is not required of every crewmember. Examples of specialized training include,
     but are not limited to, spin IP, functional check flight (FCF) pilot, etc. Individuals recognized
     by the unit will accomplish appropriate formal course training to qualify personnel in these
     specialized areas, or comply with locally developed syllabi and squadron-developed training
     programs. See Chapter 5 for specialized training program requirements.
AFI11-2SAILPLANEV1 15 APRIL 2009                                                                7


1.4. Training Concepts and Policies:
   1.4.1. Commanders will ensure training programs are designed to achieve the highest degree
   of qualification consistent with flight safety and resource availability.
   1.4.2. Units will normally train every assigned or attached pilot to MR status. The OG
   commander may approve training for individual pilots to basic aircraft qualified (BAQ) if
   there is minimal impact to the mission and adequate resources are available to support
   required nonmission sortie and event requirements. Document this authorization in the
   individual’s training folder.
   1.4.3. Night and night vision goggle training are not authorized.
   1.4.4. Instrument flight rules training is not authorized.
1.5. Training Records and Reports. Units will:
   1.5.1. Maintain aircrew records for individual training and evaluations according to AFI 11-
   202, Volume 1; AFI 11-202, Volume 2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program; and
   the RDS.
   1.5.2. Maintain formal course or equivalent training records for assigned and attached
   aircrew. Qualification documents maintained in other locations (supervisor of flying, etc.)
   need not be duplicated.
   1.5.3. Maintain original documentation for each certification either in the individual’s
   training records, on an AF IMT 1381, USAF Certification of Aircrew Training, or on an AF
   Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications.
   1.5.4. Use AF IMT 4293, Student Activity Record, or the student’s active grade sheet to
   document all instructor comments, syllabus deviations, proficiency advancement, additional
   training (including justification), incomplete missions, counseling, airsickness, and any
   unusual occurrence that could affect the pilot's progress. Instructors should annotate areas of
   student difficulty. Units may specify additional training folder requirements.
   1.5.5. Prepare and forward training reports according to MAJCOM directives.
   1.5.6. Document training in Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS), using the
   forms specified in AFI 11-202, Volume 1. Track the following information for all aircrew, as
   applicable:
       1.5.6.1. Ground training dates accomplished and due.
       1.5.6.2. Flying hours by 30, 60, and 90 days, and cumulative totals.
       1.5.6.3. Event requirements and accomplishments by cumulative total and amount
       remaining for the training cycle.
       1.5.6.4. Sortie and event currencies and expiration dates.
1.6. Pilot Utilization:
   1.6.1. Commanders will ensure assigned pilots fill only authorized positions as listed in unit
   manning documents (UMD) and pilot status is properly designated. The overall objective is
   for pilots to perform only operations-related duties. Supervisors may assign pilots to valid,
   short-term tasks (escort officer, flying evaluation board member, mishap board member,
 8                                                      AFI11-2SAILPLANEV1 15 APRIL 2009


     etc.), but must continually weigh the factors involved, such as level of pilot tasking, flying
     proficiency, currency, and experience.
     1.6.2. Duties required by various publications that may be assigned to aircrew position
     indicator (API)-1 pilots are quality assurance evaluator, programmer, flight safety officer,
     supervisor of flying, mobility contingency plans officer, training (except ARMS duties),

in ARMS. (Refer to ETCA for ancillary training.)
4.2. Training Cycle. There is one annual training cycle: 1 June to 31 May.
4.3. Quarterly Meetings:
      4.3.1. CT Meetings. Commanders will direct and supervise quarterly CT meetings. The
      purpose of these meetings is to discuss standardization and mission-related topics and to
      increase general knowledge. A CRM topic or scenario will be discussed in each CT meeting
      referring to CRM core concepts from AFI 11-290.
      4.3.2. IP Meetings. Commanders will direct and supervise quarterly IP meetings.
      Commanders will use these meetings to discuss standardization, instructional techniques,
      grading practices, and recent trends. These meetings may be combined with CT meetings if
      all topics are adequately covered.
      4.3.3. Attendance. Attendance at CT and IP meetings is mandatory. The unit will determine
      a method to track CT and IP meeting attendance as part of the go/no-go process for flight.
      Individual who are not available for CT or IP meetings will read the meeting minutes or be
      briefed by an operations supervisor before their next flight.
4.4. Ground Training Requirements. Table 4.1 summarizes sailplane pilot ground training
requirements. For ground training prescribed by other instructions, units must reference those
instructions for the latest requirement. Units may credit initial ground training accomplished

completed to determine the cause of the deficiency and if the pilot requires any additional
training in the new training cycle. If an IP fails to complete an ID sortie, then additional training
must include the delinquent ID sortie prior to performing instructor duties.
      4.6.1. The OG commander (or the NAF director of operations for a NAF flight examiner) is
      the reviewer and waiver authority. The reviewer should consider the type and magnitude of
      the deficiency and the pilot’s experience level to determine if additional training, increased
      supervision, or a waiver to the previous training cycle requirements is warranted. Document
      this waiver, with justification, in the individual’s training folder.
      4.6.2. Refer to paragraph 4.13 for guidance on prorating requirements. Refer to AFI 11-
      402, Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, for guidance on
      aviation service suspension when failure to complete requirements is for causes entirely
      within the member’s control.
      4.6.3. The minimum additional training will include all deficient sorties and events with
      appropriately certified IP supervision.
4.7. Flying Training Currencies. Table 4.3 defines currency requirements for all sailplane
pilots. Any pilot not meeting currency requirements will not perform the sortie or event except
under the supervision of an IP. Refer to Attachment 4 for guidance on logging sorties and
events for currency and recurrency. Commanders will ensure recurrency training is documented
in the individual’s training folder.

   4.8.1. Table 4.3 lists the currency items affecting qualification.
   4.8.2. When authorized by AFI 11-202, Volume 1, and approved by the OG commander,
   pilots may complete a locally generated training program. For locally generated training, the
   squadron commander will develop an individual program, taking into account the pilot’s
   previous experience and currency. The unit will send a copy of the proposed training
   program to the NAF director of operations for approval.
4.9. Loss of IP Status:
   4.9.1. An IP will be decertified for one of the following:
       4.9.1.1. Failing a flight evaluation. To regain IP status, the IP must successfully complete
       a flight evaluation according to AFI 11-2SAILPLANE, Volume 2.
       4.9.1.2. Failing a qualification written examination. To regain IP status, the IP must
       successfully reaccomplish the written examination.
       4.9.1.3. Failing to complete the ID sorties required by Table 4.2. See paragraph 4.6 to
       regain IP status.
   4.9.2. If an IP becomes noncurrent in an event or sortie listed in Table 4.3, IP status may be
   retained, but the IP will not instruct in that event or sortie until the required currency is
   regained. Supervision by another IP is required to regain currency.
4.10. Multiple Qualification Requirements. Individuals qualified in more than one MDS
(other than sailplanes) will complete all of the flying training requirements of this chapter in a
sailplane.
4.11. Flight Surgeon Requirements. FSs will accomplish CT in accordance with AFI 11-202,
Volume 1. FSs will not accomplish night sortie requirements in sailplanes. FSs will regain
currency by complying with paragraphs 2.6.1.2 of this instruction.
4.12. Indoctrination Flier Training. Indoctrination fliers will complete an annual ground
training program to include review of aircraft systems, emergency procedures, and egress
training according to AFI 11-301, Volume 1. They will complete monthly boldface testing.

experience. Units will document this waiver in the individual’s training folder.
   5.2.1. Prerequisite. MQT complete.
   5.2.2. Ground Training. Before flying with students, the unit will ensure each new IP is
   briefed on the BIP program requirements. During the BIP program, the unit will ensure each
   new IP is briefed on unit policies, CT requirements, grading practices, and student training
   records management. The unit may credit similar training accomplished during IQT and
   MQT for BIP training requirements.
   5.2.3. Flying Training. The flying training portion of the BIP program consists of two
   different kinds of sorties, BIP sorties (with the new IP) and sponsor sorties (with the new IP’s
   students).
       5.2.3.1. BIP Sorties. The new IP will complete one sortie with the BIP sponsor, a
       stan/eval pilot, or a unit supervisor. The objective for these sorties is to further develop
       the new IP’s instructional techniques. On the BIP sortie, the BIP will discuss instructional
       techniques, planning profiles, student progress, grading practices, local flying policies,
       common student errors, and pitfalls to avoid. The BIP will document sortie results in the
       new IP’s training record.
       5.2.3.2. Sponsor Sorties. The new IP’s BIP will fly one sponsor sortie with the new
       IP’s basic soaring or IQT student after the new IP completes a minimum of two sorties
       with the student. A stan/eval pilot or a supervisor in the new IP’s chain of command may

       also fly the sponsor sortie. This sortie will count as a regular syllabus sortie for the
       student. The objectives of these sorties are to improve the new IP’s perception of student
       performance, prevent inexperience from inadvertently affecting student performance, and
       enhance instructional abilities. After the sortie, the sponsor will provide feedback to the
       new IP on the student’s progress, effectiveness of instructional techniques, grading
       practices, and suggested areas for student improvement. The sponsor will document
       sortie results in the new IP’s training record.
