AETCI 36-2215, 9 Sep 2010 is supplemented as follows:

This supplement establishes requirements for administering technical training for Training
Operations (TO) and Training Groups (TRG) aligned under the 82d Training Wing (TRW). This
supplement applies to all personnel assigned to 82 TRW/TO and TRGs under 82 TRW, to
include geographically separated units (GSU) except for the 367th Training Support Squadron
(TRSS). References to courses or course personnel, as used in this supplement, apply to the
formal course instructors, instructor supervisors (IS), or other appropriate faculty or staff in the
academic flight. All signatures required by this supplement or AETCI 36-2215, may be
completed by a designated representative of the incumbent only when the incumbent is
unavailable due to leave, temporary duty (TDY), or hospitalization. Unless otherwise specified,
all references to Training Evaluations pertain to 82 TRG/TGAV, 782 TRG/TGAV, 982
TRG/TGAV, and 82 TRW/TOO. 82 TRW/TOO performs the training evaluation function for
faculty development (82 TRW/TOF). All references to 82 TRW/TOM pertain to 82 TRW
Military Training Support Flight. The term GSU includes operating locations (OL) and
detachments (Det). The term squadron commander does NOT include GSU commander. At

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction contains numerous changes and has no close approximation to a one-to-one
correspondence with the instruction it revises. This document is substantially revised and must
be completely reviewed.
1.1. The TTMS Management User’s Handbook is available at the TTMS web page accessible at
https://www-r.aetc.af.mil/ttms. For each student status code entered in TTMS, appropriate
personnel will also enter an explanation of the code in the Comments section, where the system
allows. Explanation examples include, but are not limited to: PDS class number, estimated re-
entry date, number/type of academic/performance failures, etc. Update status comments weekly,
where the system allows.

10.5. (Added) When TDY student information is not available in the TTMS, instructors and IS
will send a copy of orders to the Registrar no later than 1 duty day after the student's arrival.

12.3.3. Squadron commanders have approval authority for excusing assigned students from

day 10 and is absent the entire 8-hour day on day 11. The hour on day 10 is documented as an
absence. The 8 hours on day 11, and subsequent consecutive time until the student returns to
class, are documented as ineffective time.
12.4.1.1. (Added)      Courses/MTLs and appropriate liaison offices must notify each other

12.14.2. For NPS students, the course will forward a copy of the completed counseling forms to
the MTL/GSU commander/GSU training superintendent to be included in the student’s collateral

awards and these awards are not required to be annotated on the TTMS Student Training Record.

A8.1.4.1. (Added)      Document a dishonest attempt or dishonest completion of a course

grade were awarded an AF Form 1256, Certificate of Training, regardless of the time taken to
complete the course.” In the actual course length block (front side), enter the total hours taken
by the student who took the longest amount of time to complete the course. Instructors teaching
continuation training courses log actual time spent with students. Enter the course completion
date of the last student completing the course. If time between each student completion exceeds
