5.18.4. (Added) . Commander preliminary survey and certification requests of open storage
areas to SFPI must be coordinated through their unit security managers.

550, Basement, 552-3000. Temporary storage of Top Secret materials will be provided by the
ECC. Expanded operations (such as full formation of the Wing Battle Staff) may prohibit storage

Law Enforcement Desk, 317-907-552-3421, who will arrange alternate storage for the materials.
The 732nd Air Mobility Control Center (AMCC) 317-907-552-2858, is available to provide

certified and on the GSA approved listing by 1 October2008.
5.28.4. (Added) . Building 9468, Mundy Ave, is designated as the base central classified
destruction facility. The purpose and intent of this facility is to provide a central capability to all
US Government related common users within the base/local area/community to properly destroy
all forms of sensitive and/or classified information that lack the need or justification to procure
their own organizational equipment; it should be used to the extent feasible to save the costs of

approved container certified for up to Secret storage until delivery.

6.6.4. (Added) . For purposes of tracer actions, Alaska is considered to be in the Continental
United States (CONUS).
6.6.5. (Added) . Procedures for disseminating classified material within the unit/staff agency,

                                          Attachment 3
  EMERGENCY PROTECTIVE/RELOCATION PLAN OF CLASSIFIED MATERIAL

A3.1. Purpose/Threat. This plan supplements AFI 31-401, paragraph 1.3.6.2. It establishes
procedures for the protection and removal of classified materials in case of fires and natural
disasters. Since Alaska is one of the 50 United States, no emergency destruction plan is
required. However, the threats against Alaska are those of natural disasters, such as fires, floods,
volcanic eruptions, or earthquakes.
A3.2. Scope/Responsibilities/Limited Factors. This plan is applicable to all military activities
located on Elmendorf AFB. All personnel with appropriate security clearances are responsible
for the proper care and disposition of classified materials in their charge, with the classified
account custodians bearing primary responsibility for the security containers during the
execution of this plan. Limiting factors will vary depending on the specific emergency and
situation.
A3.3. Task Organization/Coordination Instructions. For all military activities on Elmendorf
AFB. All units must establish an operating instruction for the information security program,
detailing what actions will be accomplished by assigned personnel for securing or relocating
classified material during emergency situations described above. (NOTE: This plan must
extend to include those authorized to keep classified at home in any case of incapacitation.) The
base Security Forces and Fire Department would respond as part of their normal duties. As such,
coordination will be handled on a case by case basis.
A3.4. Protection/Relocation Procedures. In the event of fires, floods, volcanic eruptions, or
earthquakes the following actions will be taken.
   A3.4.1. The senior ranking individual assigned to the activity or the installation commander
   will implement the appropriate emergency procedures.
   A3.4.2. Time permitting, secure all classified materials in an approved security container for
   the storage of classified materials.
   A3.4.3. If time or conditions preclude proper storage, the individual in possession of the
   material at the time is responsible for its safekeeping until conditions permit proper storage.
   A3.4.4. If relocating the classified materials is required, each unit needs to have designated
   an alternate storage location. When material is to be relocated, all classified materials will be
   placed in an appropriate container (bag or box). The container will then be sealed and
   marked with the highest classification and transported to the alternate location until the
   situation is terminated.
   A3.4.5. If material cannot be accounted for after an incident, the unit security manager and
   commander will be notified immediately. Commander will then initiate a preliminary
   inquiry in accordance with AFI 31-401, Chapter 9. If communications security (COMSEC)
   material is involved, the Base COMSEC office must be notified immediately.
