This instruction implements AFPD 10-11, Operations Security, and provides guidance for safeguarding
information on certain sensitive US Air Force airborne and surface reconnaissance programs.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This is the initial publication of AFI 10-1103 which replaces AFR 55-29.



1. Need-to-Know. All those with information regarding sensitive reconnaissance programs must under-
stand the importance of safeguarding that information. They will provide access to sensitive reconnais-
sance program information or material only to those with a justified need-to-know.

2. Protective Measures. Major commands, field operating agencies, direct reporting units, and their
subordinate units will protect sensitive reconnaissance programs under their control and will:
   • Appoint program managers (PM) to oversee all aspects of security.
   • Establish special access programs following procedures in AFI 16-701, The US Air Force Access
       Programs, if normal security and safeguarding procedures are not sufficient to limit access.
   • Supplement this instruction, if required.

3. Record Keeping. PMs or their delegated representatives will indoctrinate, debrief, and maintain a
record of those with access to sensitive reconnaissance programs.
4. Classification. The author of documents relating to sensitive reconnaissance programs will classify
them using appropriate program classification guides.
