1. SCOPE:
     1.1. This instruction establishes responsibilities and operating procedures for vehicle
     operations either motorized or non-motorized on the airfield. Vehicle operation is for official
     use only, with maximum attention paid to safety and accident prevention. Operators shall not
     deviate from procedures or principles set forth in this instruction except in the interest of
     safety. Airfield safety must be part of every operation; conscientious and safe operations can
     prevent most accidents. The requirements of this instruction shall be included in the unit’s
     self-inspection program if personnel perform airfield driving duties. An Airfield Driving
     Program Inspection Checklist is included as Attachment 9.
     1.2. Vehicles on the airfield present a clear and definite danger, both to aircraft and ground
     personnel. Carelessness, haste and disregard for established safety standards are the primary
     sources of aircraft/vehicle incidents. Human beings by nature are creatures of habit. The
     goal of the Airfield Driving Program (ADP) is to maintain a safe flying environment by
     training all personnel to establish good/safe airfield vehicle operating habits.
     1.3. The standards set in this instruction apply to all owners, users, and operators of vehicles
     (motorized and non-motorized) on the airfield. Only properly trained and certified personnel
911AWI13-202 15 DECEMER 2010                                                                   3


  may drive on the airfield. All personnel operating a vehicle on the airfield must be
  knowledgeable of and comply with this instruction. In addition, drivers shall be trained on
  local driving procedures and possess a valid Air Force (AF) Form 483, Certificate of
  Competency. The AF Form 483 must be endorsed by Pittsburgh ARS Airfield Management
  (911 OSF/OSAA) in order to be valid. This requirement applies to military and civilian
  employees assigned to, visiting, contracted or on temporary duty to this base, and to all types
  of vehicles, i.e., military, commercial, and privately owned.
  1.4. All base assigned personnel who drive a vehicle on the airfield shall complete all
  training and testing requirements. Airfield experience (e.g. operating vehicles or aircraft) is
  not a substitute for completion of airfield driving training and testing requirements as
  outlined in this instruction.
  1.5. This instruction does not address every possible scenario. Contact Airfield Management
  if you have any questions or require clarification.
