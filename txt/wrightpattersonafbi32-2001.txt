Section A—General Information

1. Objectives. To provide with due regard to function, for the design, operation, and
maintenance of buildings and structures for safety to life from fire. The importance of a good fire
prevention program cannot be overemphasized. It is vital to the effective accomplishment of the
AFMC mission and must be practiced at all levels. The destructiveness of a fire could easily
cause mission failure or serious delay in mission accomplishment.

Section B—Responsibilities

2. Installation Commander. Responsible for fire protection at WPAFB and its satellite
stations, and exercises primary responsibility through the Base Civil Engineer (BCE).
3. Base Fire Marshal. The BCE is designated to assist the base commander in discharging fire
protection responsibilities.
4. Base Fire Chief. The fire chief manages the fire protection organization and exercises those
duties outlined in AFI 32-2001, Fire Emergency Services Program.
5. Base Medical Services. The 88 MDG provides Emergency Medical Systems supplies,
equipment, and medical personnel as required in response to various base emergencies and
selected training activities.
 4                                        WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI32-2001 18 APRIL 2013


6. Security Forces (SF). Responds to the scene of fires or emergencies for traffic/crowd
control. The SF member reports to the senior fire officer in charge at the scene for instructions.
They protect and guard the scene after the emergency if further investigation is warranted.
7. Group, Squadron, Unit or Detachment Commanders and Supervisors at All Levels:
     7.1. Are responsible for the enforcement of this instruction and must make sure sound fire
     prevention procedures are established and practiced in each activity or facility under their
     jurisdiction.
     7.2. Ensure an Operating Instruction (OI) is developed, Attachment 2, for their organization
     to follow when fire is discovered. The OI must cover fire reporting, building evacuation to
     include assisting handicapped people, safeguarding classified information, and basic fire
     suppression procedures. Depending on the type of activity, instructions must also include
     such items as emergency removal of aircraft from hangars, protection of high value and/or
     critical material and mishaps involving fuel. A completed copy must be forwarded to Fire
     Prevention Section, 88 ABW/CEFP. NOTE: The intent of paragraph 7.2., is not for every
     group, squadron, organizational or detachment commander and supervisor to develop their
     own OI. However, there will be an OI for each facility. Those facilities that are occupied by
     more than one organization are requested to have the major user develop the OI and forward
     it to the other organizations for coordination and adoption. The RPBM is designated as the
     OPR for the development of the OI since he/she is the most familiar with the organizations
     and operations that are located throughout the facility.
     7.3. Periodically inspect their organizations to ensure compliance with governing
     instructions to eliminate fire hazards.
     7.4. Ensure the complete fire prevention orientation of assigned workers, custodians, and
     supervisors. Supervisors at all levels are responsible for enforcing sound fire prevention
     practices in their work areas.
     7.5. Make sure that all work areas are left in a fire-safe condition at the end of each tour of
     duty.
     7.6. Fire prevention inspections and practices in facilities, rooms, or areas which are under
     lock and key are the responsibility of the individual supervisor maintaining that secured area.
     It is the supervisor's responsibilities to arrange access to these areas for base fire inspectors to
     perform scheduled fire prevention inspections.
8. RPBM. Each RPBM or alternate is responsible to the organizational commander for fire
safety within facilities under their jurisdiction. These duties include:
     8.1. The primary or alternate RPBM shall accompany the fire inspector on all scheduled fire
     inspections of facilities under their control.
     8.2. Ensuring periodic fire drills are conducted according to paragraph 14 of this instruction.
     Fire evacuation drills are not held during inclement weather.
     8.3. Coordinating with the Fire Emergency Services Flight (88 ABW/CEF) the placement
     and use of vending machines and rented or leased equipment.
     8.4. RPBM training to be conducted by the fire inspector during the course of a scheduled
     fire inspection. This training is documented and maintained in the facility folder.
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI32-2001 18 APRIL 2013                                                         5


   8.5. In those facilities jointly occupied by more than one organization, the RPBM should
   notify the other organizations to correct hazards/deficiencies within their areas and follow-up
   to ensure corrective action has been taken. The RPBM’s responsibilities are to inspect the
   facility, ensure fire hazards are eliminated, check emergency lights and exit light battery
   back-up mode and ensure fire extinguishers have been accounted for and ready for use.
   Monthly documentation of extinguisher inspections are a must!

Section C—Fire Prevention Requirements and Procedures

9. Fire Prevention Inspection Procedures. 88 ABW/CEFP performs scheduled and
unscheduled inspections of all facilities and areas determined by the fire chief. Fire hazards
and/or deficiencies identified during an inspection are recorded on an AF Form 1487, Fire
Prevention Visit Report.
   9.1. A copy is given to the person accompanying the fire inspector, normally the RPBM.
   This person starts corrective action within his/her authority and capability.
   9.2. The original copy of the inspection report is sent to the functional manager, 3-Ltr.
   He/She is required to review, fill out and sign the reverse side, blocks 19-22, after corrective
   actions have been taken and return it to 88 ABW/CEFP by the suspense date in block 5.
   9.3. Processing and Managing FSDs. These processes are not an alternative to the
   operational risk management (ORM) analysis; rather, ORM is an integral part of the risk
   quantification necessary to processing and managing FSDs. ORM documentation should be
   part of the supporting information with any mitigation/corrective action plan or
   alternative/equivalency/exemption approval request.
       9.3.1. FSD I. FSD I indicates a deficiency with the greatest risk to life and mission
       continuity. Facilities with an identified FSD I should not be occupied except in
       accordance with an approved corrective action plan.
          9.3.1.1. Corrective Action Plan. For an existing facility, a mitigation/corrective
          action plan shall be prepared by the facility user with the support of the fire
          emergency service flight, the CEP flight, the operations flight (as appropriate), and
          wing safety. The plan shall specifically identify the level of occupancy and
          operations permitted pending the correction of the FSD I. The wing commander shall
          approve the plan before forwarding it to the MAJCOM/A7 for informational
          purposes.
       9.3.2. FSD II. FSD II indicates a significant risk to mission continuity and/or existing
       property capability. Facilities with an identified FSD II should not be occupied unless
       interim control measures are in place.
          9.3.2.1. Corrective Action Plan. For an existing facility, a mitigation/corrective
          action plan shall be prepared by the facility user with the support of the fire
          emergency service flight, the CEP flight, the operations flight (as appropriate), and
          wing safety. The plan shall specifically identify the level of occupancy and
          operations permitted pending the correction of the FSD II. The wing commander (or
          other appropriate commander) shall approve the plan before forwarding it to the
          MAJCOM/A7 for informational purposes.
 6                                        WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI32-2001 18 APRIL 2013


        9.4. Correct the hazard/deficiency.
     9.4.1. When no hazard/deficiencies are found, or are corrected on the spot, the reverse side
     of the AF Form 218, Facility Fire Prevention/Protection Record, is used to document the
     inspection. The fire inspector maintains this form. No other actions are required.
10. Fire Reporting Procedures. Notify the Fire Emergency Services Flight by dialing 9-1-1
throughout the base, including Prairies, Woods, and Brick quarters. Each telephone will have a
WPAFB Form 1450, Emergency 911 Decal, affixed to it. In few cases, you must dial a 9 or 99
prior to the traditional 9-1-1 in order to place the call, however each business phone should have
a decal affixed with the proper number identified. If additional, WPAFB 1450, Emergency 911
Decals, are needed, call the Fire Prevention office at 257-4075. The facility manager is
responsible for ensuring compliance with this requirement. It is the duty of any individual who
discovers a fire, or potential fire, to notify the Fire Emergency Services Flight by the fastest
means available. All fires, regardless of size or nature, must be reported to the fire department
for investigation and record. This includes fires, which have been extinguished. WARNING: A
false alarm is a malicious act. Anyone transmitting a false alarm is subject to severe disciplinary
action. In the event of a fire or any indication of fire, such as smoke, odors, or unusual heat
conditions, take the following actions:
     10.1. Alert All Personnel. Sound the alarm, verbal or mechanical. Pass the alarm to other
     occupants by word of mouth and/or by activating the building fire alarm system if the
     building has one.
     10.2. When reporting a fire, someone should be directed to wait outside to direct the
     responding firefighting equipment to the location of the fire. Persons calling:
        10.2.1. Give building number and location, e.g., area A, or B.
        10.2.2. Give facility title, e.g., Officers Club, theater, etc.
        10.2.3. Tell where fire is, e.g., kitchen, basement, etc.
        10.2.4. Tell the nature of the fire if known, e.g., flammable liquids, trash, etc.
        10.2.5. Tell how bad the fire is, e.g., whole room involved or small fire
        10.2.6. Give your name phone number, location, room or post number.
        10.2.7. Keep calm, speak clearly and answer all questions asked by the fire dispatcher.
        Do not hang up until told to do so.
     10.3. Cellular Phones used to call 9-1-1. If on WPAFB and calling from a Cell Phone, the
     number is (937) 257-9111 to connect directly to the WPAFB Fire Department Emergency
     Dispatch Center. If you dial 9-1-1 from a Cell Phone your call goes to the nearest County
     Emergency Dispatcher. You will need to request to be transferred to the Wright Patterson
     Emergency Dispatcher and they will transfer you.
11. Emergency plans. Emergency plans shall be provided for high-rise, health care,
ambulatory health care, residential board and care, assembly, day care centers, special
amusement buildings, detention and correctional occupancies, underground and windowless
structures, facilities storing or handling hazardous materials.
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI32-2001 18 APRIL 2013                                                         7


   11.1. Emergency plans shall be developed in accordance with NFPA 101, Life Safety Code,
   and shall include the procedures for reporting of emergencies; occupant and staff response to
   emergencies; the type and coverage of building fire protection systems.
   11.2. Emergency plans should include the following items based on the type of occupancy
   and hazards involved:
       11.2.1. Procedures for reporting of emergencies relocating and/or evacuating occupants.
       11.2.2. Occupants or staff member duties during emergencies.
       11.2.3. Floor plans identifying the locations of portable fire extinguishers, other manual
       fire-extinguishing equipment, other automatic or manual fire suppression systems, first
       aid equipment, hazardous material spill equipment.
       11.2.4. Manual fire alarm pull stations and fire alarm control panels.
       11.2.5. Floor plans identifying the primary and secondary routes of evacuation for each
       room or portion of the occupancy.
       11.2.6. Floor plans indicating the locations of interior areas of refuge.
       11.2.7. Site maps identifying the designated exterior assembly area for each evacuation
       route.
       11.2.8. Assessments of both building systems and management features.
       11.2.9. Use of alarms.
       11.2.10. Transmission of alarm to fire department.

       11.2.16. Designation of an emergency response coordinator and a back-up coordinator.
       11.2.17. An alternate means of communications other than the fire alarm.
       11.2.18. Emergency contact information.
   11.3. An Emergency Plan, Attachment 4, is a requirement for your facility and varies based
   on type of Occupancy. Request the assistance from the 88 ABW/CEFP at 257-4075 in
   developing your Emergency Plan.
   11.4. Facility Emergency Plan should be reviewed and updated to reflect current information
   annually.
12. Building Evacuation Procedures. When notified of a fire, either by word of mouth or fire
evacuation alarm, all personnel must evacuate the facility by the most direct route. If time
allows, close all doors, windows, secure safes and shut off unnecessary equipment. This deters
the spread of fire and reduces possible injury to other personnel.
 8                                       WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI32-2001 18 APRIL 2013


     12.1. Once clear of the building, all employees, and visitors should meet at the designated
     assembly areas outside the facility. Supervisors ensure the accountability of their employees
     and report to the facility manager.
     12.2. Assisting the Handicapped. The supervisor establishes procedures to assist
     handicapped personnel during building evacuation. Remember elevators may not be
     available. At a minimum 2 personnel should be assigned this duty. If difficulties occur while
     rendering assistance, one person should remain with the handicapped individual and the other
     individual report to the Fire Department On-Scene Commander the location and number of
     personnel remaining in the facility. If this is impossible to accomplish dial 9-1-1 and give the
     information to the Fire Department Dispatcher.
13. Fire Prevention Training Requirements. Required for all personnel. Fire prevention
training is divided into two categories: General and specific.
     13.1. General fire prevention training is required for all newly assigned military and civilian
     personnel, including temporary or over-hires, working on WPAFB within 30 days. This

14. Fire Drills. Fire drills are conducted periodically to ensure all personnel with specific fire
protection duties and responsibilities during emergency situations can perform these duties. Fire
drills also reduce the possibility of panic in a real situation. Speed in evacuating buildings,
although important, is not the primary objective and should be secondary to proper order and
discipline. Drills should be held at unexpected times and under varying conditions to simulate
unusual fire situations. Managers of facilities with fire alarm systems will request assistance
from the Fire Emergency Services Flight before any system is activated. The fire department is
notified before any fire drill. Mandatory fire drills are conducted as follows:

Terms
Fire Safety Deficiency (FSD)—Requires a matrix to determine the priority required for the
corrective action. They are prioritized according to their seriousness. These codes are used in the
same manner as RAC’s per AFI 91-301, Air Force Occupational and Environmental Safety, Fire
Protection, and Health (AFOSH) Program. FSD’s are defined as conditions that reduce fire
safety below an acceptable level, including noncompliance with standards, but that on their own
cannot cause a fire.
Fire Door—An internal door installed in a building to separate sections or certain areas, to
prevent damage by heat or smoke in the event of a fire.
Fire Hazard—A condition that can cause a fire.
Fire Protection—All aspects of fire engineering, fire prevention, fire suppression, and related
rescue operations.
Fire Prevention—Efforts directed toward avoiding the start of a fire.

Fire Suppression—The detection, response, attack, control, confinement, and extinguishment of
a fire.
Functional Managers—The senior operating official at all levels exercising managerial control
over an activity or operation. These individuals are usually those officials who can acquire and
commit resources for the abatement of occupational safety, fire and health hazards.
Hazard Abatement—To eliminate or reduce a safety, fire, or health hazard in compliance with
AFI 91-302, Air Force Occupational and Environmental Safety, Fire Protection, and Health
(AFOSH) Standards.
Interim Controls—Temporary measures pending permanent corrective action.
Real Property Building Manager (RPBM)—A person who signs receipt for any facility under
his/her jurisdiction. Facility managers are responsible for the fire-safe condition of the facilities
and equipment under their jurisdiction.
Risk Assessment Code (RAC)—Qualified safety, fire protection, and health personnel will
evaluate each occupational hazard or deficiency and assign a RAC. Fire Department issued
RAC’s are defined as hazardous conditions that will cause a fire.

Plan Date

A2.1. This operating instruction/procedures establishes internal procedures to ensure sound
resource protection for all personnel and equipment within building XXXXXX. This operating
instruction/procedures is/are applicable to all personnel assigned to building XXXXXX.
A2.2. References:
A2.2.1. AFI 32-2001, Fire Protection Operations and Fire Prevention Program.
A2.2.2. WPAFBI 32-2001, Fire Prevention Program.
A2.2.3. OSHA 1910.38, Employee Emergency Evacuation Plans.
A2.2.4. AFI 91-302, Air Force Occupational and Environmental Safety, Fire Protection and
Health (AFOSH) Standards
A2.3. Fire Reporting Procedures:
A2.3.1. All fires must be reported, even those, which have been extinguished. In the event of a
fire, such as smoke, odor, or unusual heat conditions, take the following actions:
A2.3.1.1. Alert All Personnel. Sound the alarm to other occupants by word of mouth and/or by
activating a manual fire alarm pull station located throughout the facility. Operation of a manual
pull station will activate an audible warning device and also transmit an alarm to the fire
department communication center.
A2.3.1.2. Notify the Fire Protection Division. Dial "9-1-1" and give the following information:
Building number, tell where the fire is (i.e., room number, basement), give your name and rank.
Remember to keep calm, speak clearly and answer all questions asked by the communication
center dispatcher. Do not hang up until told to do so. When reporting a fire someone should be
directed to wait outside to direct the responding firefighting equipment to the location of the fire.
If on WPAFB and calling from a Cell Phone, the number is (937) 257-9111 to connect directly to
the WPAFB Fire Department Emergency Dispatch Center. If you dial 9-1-1 from a Cell Phone
your call goes to the nearest County Emergency Dispatcher. You need to request to be
transferred to the Wright Patterson Emergency Dispatcher and they will transfer you.
A2.3.1.3. Building Evacuation Procedures. When notified of a fire by word of mouth or fire
evacuation bells, all personnel must evacuate the facility by the most direct route.
A2.3.1.3.1. If time allows close all doors, windows, secure safes (or hand carry classified
material) and shut off any unnecessary equipment. This deters the spread of fire and reduces
possible injury to other personnel.
A2.3.1.3.2. Once clear of the building, all employees (and visitors) should meet at the designated
assembly area outside the facility, and inform the fire department of any people that aren't
accounted for and last known location.
 24                                     WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI32-2001 18 APRIL 2013


A2.3.1.3.3. Assisting the Handicapped. The supervisor establishes procedures to assist
handicapped personnel during building evacuation. Remember, elevators may not be available.
At a minimum, 2 personnel should be assigned this duty. If difficulties occur while rendering
assistance, one person remain with the handicapped individual and the other individual report to
the Fire Department On Scene Commander the location and number of personnel remaining in
the facility. If this is impossible to accomplish dial 9-1-1 and give the information to the Fire
Department Dispatcher.
A2.3.1.4. Basic Fire Suppression Procedures (using fire extinguishers):
A2.3.1.4.1. After the alarm has been sounded and it appears that the fire could be contained or
possibly extinguished without danger, then personnel, by using the proper fire extinguisher, may
attempt to extinguish the fire if properly trained.
A2.3.1.4.2. When fighting a fire, remember the following: Stay low to avoid breathing the heated
smoke, vapors or fumes as much as possible and stay near a door for an escape route. If the fire
is uncontrollable, get out of the area and close the door behind you.
A2.3.1.5. Classification of Fires and Extinguishing Agents. Fires are divided into five main
classes based on materials involved. Use of the proper extinguishing agent is vital for the class of
fire. All personnel must be able to determine the type of fire and the correct extinguishing agent
to use on each as follows:
A2.3.1.5.1. Class A . Fires involving organic material such as paper, wood, cloth, excelsior, etc.
Fires of this type can best be extinguished with water, or ABC dry chemical fire extinguisher.
A2.3.1.5.2. Class B . Fires involving flammable or combustible liquids such as gasoline, oil,
paints, cooking fats, etc. Class B fires are best extinguished by smothering or replacing the
surrounding air with an inert agent. Fire extinguishing agents for use on Class B fires are carbon
dioxide (CO2) or dry chemical.
A2.3.1.5.3. Class C . Fires involving energized electrical components such as electrical wires,
motors, switches, transformers, appliances, etc. The fire-extinguishing agent applied to Class C
fires must not be a conductor of electricity. The best fire control method is to turn off the
electrical power to the item. The types of fire extinguishing agents to be used are (CO2) or dry
chemical.
A2.3.1.5.4. Class D . Fires involving combustible metals such as magnesium, titanium,
potassium, sodium, and lithium are best extinguished by using a blanket effect. These fires must
be extinguished by a special extinguisher. This extinguisher is easily identified by being painted
yellow or have a yellow star on it.
A2.3.1.5.5. Class K . Fires in cooking appliances that involve combustible cooking media,
vegetable or animal oils and fats. NOTE. Some extinguishers may be used on different classes of
fire (A, B, or C)
