1. Cellular Telephone (CT) Use Policy.
   1.1. Acquisition of new Cellular Telephone (CT) devices. The use of cellular phones is restricted to
   commanders, vice commanders, First Sergeants, deputy commanders, key and/or standby personnel
   who require two way communications of an immediate nature that cannot be satisfied through the use
   of pagers or land mobile radios (LMR). CTs will not be used for command and control. Commanders,
   division chiefs, and organizational management are responsible for ensuring oversight of CT assets,
   and periodic checks of CT management. CTs are to be used for administrative purposes only.
   1.2. Air Force provided CTs are to be used for official and authorized purposes. Personnel are autho-
   rized to use CTs to make short infrequent personal calls when appropriate under the circumstances.
   An example of appropriate calls includes notifying family members of changes in work schedules and
   delays. Emergency calls are always authorized. Examples of inappropriate calls include obscene or
   harassing calls, calls for commercial gain, or personal calls that generate more than minimal charges
   to the government.
   1.3. Use a regular (corded land line) telephone as a first priority when and where available.
   1.4. Telephone Monitoring and Recording.
2                                                        MILDENHALLI33-106 19 OCTOBER 2007


       1.4.1. The Air Force uses unsecured telecommunications systems such as telephones, CTs, radios,
       facsimile, pagers, computer networks and other wired or wireless electronic devices to conduct
       day-to-day official business. Adversaries can easily monitor unsecured systems that could provide
       information on military capabilities, limitations, intentions and activities. See AFI 33-219, Tele-
       communications Monitoring and Assessment Program (TMAP).
       1.4.2. When a CT is issued, personnel are required to sign a form that includes the following
       notice and consent statement: “Do not transmit classified information over unsecured telecommu-
       nications systems. Official DoD telecommunications systems are subject to monitoring. Using this
       telecommunications system or device constitutes consent to monitoring.” (A sample consent state-
       ment is provided in Attachment 2.) The signed forms will be retained by the owning unit’s Tele-
       phone Control Officer (TCO) until 6 months after the device is returned. Every CT will have a DD
       Form 2056 (miniature version) attached. These forms can be obtained from the Base PWCS
       office.
    1.5. Each Unit TCO will validate their unit’s itemized CT bill(s) monthly. These validations will be
    performed in accordance with paragraph 4. below prior to the GPC holder paying the CT bill(s).

2. Requesting Cellular Telephone or Blackberry Services:
    2.1. All requests must be submitted with complete justification and appropriate documentation in
    advance of purchase.
    2.2. Requests are made by completing an entry into the Project Workflow Requirements Resources
    (PWRR) system. The PWRR input must document the communications requirement, not the specific
    need for a specific equipment item. The request must provide sufficient justification as to why a
    mobile communications asset is needed. All initial Blackberry (BB) requests will be approved by the
    100 Communications Squadron Commander as Host Base Communications Systems Officer (CSO),
    who is the Approval Authority. All initial requests for standard CT’s will also be approved by the 100
    Communications Squadron Commander as Host Base Communications Systems Officer (CSO), who
    is the Base Approval Authority. PWRR will be submitted to 100 CS/SCXP.
    2.3. Before requesting a BB, ensure the items under Attachment 3 have been fully researched.
       2.3.1. If the using organization identifies a functional requirement to communicate sensitive
       unclassified or classified information, a completed operations security (OPSEC) analysis docu-
       ment and certification of risk acceptability (see AFI 10-1101, Operations Security) must accom-
       pany the original PWRR requirement.
       2.3.2. OPSEC determination is disputed; the issue will be elevated to 100CS/CC.
       2.3.3. The Communications and Information Systems Officer (CSO) will review the completed
       package and will recommend whether the requiring commander should accept the risk and fund
       the requirement.
    2.4. The PWRR is also used to upgrade a communications account. Any new upgrades to the original
    PWRR request must also be kept on file.
    2.5. When an account is terminated, the old CT will be turned in to 100 CS/SCXW for possible reuti-
    lization or proper disposal to DRMO; old BBs disposition will be determined by 100 CS/SCBBX,
    Computer Systems Management.
MILDENHALLI33-106 19 OCTOBER 2007                                                                        3


3. Billing for Unofficial Calls.
   3.1. All personal calls, as described under paragraph 1.2., made on government CT that cause the CT
   bill to exceed the established monthly-allotted usage charge will be reimbursed by the user.
   3.2. The unit TCO will be responsible for monitoring CT bills to determine if toll charges for unoffi-
   cial calls are being incurred. Identified users will be directed to take appropriate action to reimburse
   the government.
   3.3. AFI 33-111, Voice Systems Management, explains how to recover unofficial call costs. The TCO
   reviews all telephone data and informs the Unit’s commander and the Unit’s resource advisor when
   there is abuse. Unit resource advisors will be responsible for collection of unauthorized CT usage fees
   via a DD Form 1131.

4. Monthly Requirements.
   4.1. A monthly validation of CT bills must be performed prior to payment of the bill. The monthly
   validation process is initiated by 100 CS/SCXW by sending a CT validation letter to each Unit’s TCO
   (see Attachment 4 for a sample monthly validation letter). The CT account invoices are sent to each
   unit directly by the supplier. Upon validation of the bill, the Unit TCO will sign their name and date
   under the stamped or written words, “VALIDATED BY”, on the very first page of the bill to signify
   validation. The CT validation letter will then be signed at the bottom acknowledging all appropriate
   actions have been taken by the Unit TCO. The validation letter will then be returned to 100 CS/SCXW
   verifying all calls were for official business and all personal calls were kept to a minimum not to
   exceed the monthly allotted usage plans for each bill. Unit TCOs will maintain a copy of this CT
   monthly verification letter for at least 3 years. Any CT additions or deletions will be annotated on the
   Unit TCO’s CT inventory sheet and a new updated copy will be sent back with the monthly validation
   letter to 100 CS/SCXW. 100 CS/SCXW will maintain these validations for each unit for a minimum
   of 3 years.

5. Annual Requirements.
   5.1. 100 CS/SCXW will send an annual inventory listing to each Unit TCO for revalidation of CTs.
   This listing will be utilized to inventory, account for, validate all CTs within the unit and ensure all
   CTs have the DD Form 2056 attached. The Unit TCO will send the completed, signed revalidation
   spreadsheet back to 00 CS/SCXW for compilation of the base’s complete wireless communication
   inventory. 100 CS/SCXW will maintain this inventory

                  CUSTOMER BRIEFING AND ACCOUNTABILITY RECEIPT
1. This briefing is intended to inform those using a government cellular telephone (CT) of the user respon-
sibilities.
2. CT Costs: The using organization is billed for each individual CT number. Our service provider World-
Cell (with Vodafone as subcontractor) bills RAF Mildenhall units at a contracted rate; personal calls
should be kept to an absolute minimum, and should not overrun plan minutes even if you are willing to
reimburse the government. A regular telephone (corded landline) shall be used as a first priority when and
where available. Bills are reviewed carefully for unofficial or questionable charges. You will be asked to
validate to your unit Telephone Control Officer that all CT charges to your number were for official pur-
poses.


3. Security. CTs are not to be used for operational communications, i.e., those which may be considered
sensitive or For Official Use Only. IAW AFI 33-111, Voice Systems Management, Do not use regular
unclassified CT for C2 purposes. The weak CT signal is susceptible to jamming, intrusion, interference
and monitoring. All Blackberries must be password protected.


4. Fraud, Waste and Abuse. Using a government CT without approval for other than official government
business and authorized calls without reimbursement to the government is fraud. Using a CT in lieu of
other available government landlines, where available, is abuse. Using a CT when pagers and radios will
accomplish the mission is waste.


5. Statements of Understanding. By signing below, I certify that I will not discuss classified or sensitive
information on this device. I acknowledge and understand the following statement IAW AFI 33-219. “Do
not transmit classified information over unsecured telecommunications systems. Official DOD telecom-
munications systems are subject to monitoring. Using this telecommunications system or device consti-
tutes consent to monitoring.”




I acknowledge receipt of and responsibility for the items described herein. I certify that all charges
incurred on this cellular phone while it is signed out to me will be for government official and authorized
calls, unless otherwise noted.
