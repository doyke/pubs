2. Procedures:
   2.1. Guidelines. It is the goal of the Niagara Falls ARS is to provide quality lodging facilities
   and service, while keeping official travel costs at a minimum. On-base lodging will be used
   to the maximum extent possible prior to granting reservists commercial contract quarters.
      2.1.1. Authorized Personnel. Niagara Falls ARS offers UTA lodging for Reserve
      member in non-commuting status only. Family accompanying reservist during the
      UTAs will be considered Space “A” and may result in the member seeking lodging off-
      base, at their own expense.
      2.1.2. Reservations Policy. Reservations for UTA Lodging must be made no more than 5
      days after the previous UTA for the next training cycle. Reservists are encouraged to use
      the sign-up sheet located at the main desk in the Main Lodge to request their rooms. If
      reservations need to be made over the telephone the member must receive a confirmation
      number from the lodging staff. If a reservation is not made there is no guarantee of a
      room on base.
          2.1.2.1. Within five days after the completion of the UTA, lodging will input the
          names and procure the necessary lodging facilities.
      2.1.3. Room Assignments. Room assignments are established on a first come/first serve
      basis. Once assigned a room, members may not be moved to another room or building for
      convenience. Niagara Falls ARS Lodging allows persons who share rooms to reserve
      their rooms with a specific roommate as long as they are arriving on the same day and the
      reservations are made within the allotted time period.
      2.1.4. Check-In Procedures. Military identification cards are required at check-in. Check-
      in for the Friday before the UTA is between 1400 hours and 0300 hours. Check-in for a
      UTA Saturday is between 0600 hours and 1300 hours. If the member cannot check-in
      during these hours they must notify the lodging staff by 1300 hours on the check-in date.

    2.1.5. Check-Out Procedures. Check-out time is 0800 hours on Saturday and 1100 hours
    Sunday through Friday. Individuals will be charged late fees if they check-out after 1200
    hours. This late fee is the individuals’ responsibility and will not be paid by the unit.
    2.1.6. Cancellation Procedure. Cancellations must be made before 1800 hours on Fridays
    and before 1300 hours on Saturdays. The member must obtain a cancellation number
    from the lodging staff canceling the reservation. Failure to do so will be considered a no-
    show.
    2.1.7. No Show Policy. Reservists requesting rooms and not checking into Lodging as
    outlined in Para. 2.1.4. will be considered no-shows.
       2.1.7.1. First time No-Show. The Unit First Sergeant and Unit Commanders will
       receive notification and a “Warning Letter” (See Attachment 1) will be sent to the
       member notifying them of their no-show status.
       2.1.7.2. Second time No-Show. Reservists making reservations and not checking in
       at lodging at the designated times for a second time in a twelve month period will
       receive a “Denial of Lodging Letter.”(See Attachment 2) This letter will deny the
       member on-base lodging or commercial lodging for the next UTA. Reservists in this
       status will be required to make and pay for their own lodging for their next UTA.
       This status does not alleviate the reservist from fulfilling any military obligations.
       2.1.7.3. Third time No-Show. Reservists making reservations and not checking in at
       lodging at the designated times for a third time in a twelve month period will receive
       a “Lodging Privileges Suspension Letter.”(See Attachment 3) This letter expires six
       drill months after the offense. Reservists in this status will be required to make and
       pay for their own lodging for their UTAs. This status does not alleviate the reservist
       from fulfilling any military obligations.
    2.1.8. Commercial Lodging Requirements. “Only” the Niagara Lodge’s management
    staff or designees may contact the hotel to make additions to the commercial lodging
    requirement once the reservation has been established. If a member is manipulating the
    system in order to receive off-base lodging they may forfeit their lodging privileges.
