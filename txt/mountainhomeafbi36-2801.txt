1. General:
   1.1. Purpose. Recognition of deserving personnel for the appropriate award is a continuing responsi-
   bility of supervisors, first sergeants, and commanders at all levels. Such recognition is essential to an
   individual's success and career advancement. Accordingly, supervisory personnel must carefully eval-
   uate the qualifications of their personnel and nominate only those deserving such recognition.
   1.2. Recognition Ceremony. Winners will be recognized at the quarterly awards ceremony and/or
   the annual awards banquet. These events are mandatory for all nominees. 366 FW/CCC (Command
   Chief Master Sergeant) will designate at least one primary and one alternate senior noncommissioned
   officer responsible for all arrangements surrounding these two events. Attendance is encouraged for
   first sergeants, commanders, supervisors, family members, and friends.
   1.3. Eligibility. All military personnel and civilian personnel as outlined in paragraph 1.4. are eligible
   for nomination in the appropriate category. Members compete in the grade category they held during
   the majority of the award period (e.g. if a member has held the grade of TSgt for 2 months of the
   award period and is promoted to MSgt, nominate the member in the NCO category, not the SNCO cat-
   egory). If the member is promoted at the mid-month point of the award cycle, the unit commander
   determines in which category to nominate the member. MHAFB tenant units are encouraged to partic-
   ipate in 366 FW Quarterly Awards program by submitting nominees in respective categories outlined
   in paragraph 1.4. of this instruction. Nominees from MHAFB tenant units may compete for quarterly
   recognition as part of the FWS. MHAFB tenant units will compete for annual awards through their
   respective parent organizations.
      1.3.1. Quarterly Awards. There is no limit to how many times an individual can be nominated
      or selected for this award; however, the same individual may not be nominated for two consecu-
      tive quarters.
      1.3.2. Annual Awards. Annual competition is completely separate from quarterly competition.
      Quarterly award winners are not automatic nominees for annual awards. Separate nomination
      packages must be submitted for the annual awards.
   1.4. Categories:
      1.4.1. Airman: Airman Basic - Senior Airman.
      1.4.2. Noncommissioned Officer: Staff Sergeant - Technical Sergeant.

      1.4.4. Company Grade Officer (CGO): Second Lieutenant – Captain
      1.4.5. Field Grade Officer (FGO): Major – Lieutenant Colonel
      1.4.6. Civilian Categories:
          1.4.6.1. Category I (Civilian Employee): All Civil Service General Schedule and Wage
          Grades 8 and below
          1.4.6.2. Category II (Senior Civilian Employee): All Civil Service General Schedule, Wage
          Grades, Wage Leaders, and Wage Supervisors 9 and above

       (366 MXG), 366th Mission Support Group (366 MSG), 366th Medical Group (366 MDG) and
       Fighter Wing Staff (FWS). Each group may submit one nomination each to compete for the quar-
       terly/annual awards.
       1.7.2. FGO, Flt/CC and the civilian categories will be selected by package review only using the
       AF Form 1206. Enlisted and CGO award recipients will be selected by package review and a per-
       sonal interview. If a nominee is unable to meet the board in person then video teleconference, tele-
       phone interview, or a decision to take the mean score if all efforts to meet the board fail will be
       used. Questions for the board will primarily be to review military bearing, wear of uniform, over-
       all appearance, and communication abilities.
MOUNTAINHOMEAFBI36-2801 11 JULY 2006                                                                    5


        1.7.2.1. Enlisted Category Questions. Each nominee should be able to answer the follow-
        ing:
            1.7.2.1.1. What they do and how they personally contribute to the mission of the squadron,
            the wing and our Air Force?
            1.7.2.1.2. A question related to their heritage as Air Force enlisted members.
            1.7.2.1.3. A question related to current events affecting the military/Air Force and/or our
            mission and future.
            1.7.2.1.4. A question developed from a bullet in their nomination package (AF Form
            1206)
            1.7.2.1.5. Every NCO and SNCO should be able to tell the board who their people are and
            about the families of their subordinates.
        1.7.2.2. CGO Category Questions. CGO board questions are approved by the President of
        the board and are generally opinion based. Below is a suggested framework of questions to
        follow that will help aide in the development of potential questions to use on the board.
            1.7.2.2.1. Mission. The primary task of a military organization is to perform its mission.
            This is paramount, and everything else must be subordinate to this objective. As a leader,
            your primary responsibility is to lead people to carry out the unit’s mission successfully.
            1.7.2.2.2. Leadership. Leadership is essential to a successful officer. Increase proficiency
            in preparation of performance reports and proper way to wear the uniform will make a
            good officer a better officer. But such proficiency is not essential to an officer. Leadership
            is essential.
            1.7.2.2.3. Set the Example. You must set the standard for your unit. People will emulate
            your standards of personal conduct and appearance. They will observe your negative char-
            acteristics as well as your positive one. If you are arrogant, or domineering, you will
            deserve no respect, only resentment.
            1.7.2.2.4. Officer Evaluation System. The measurement of an officer’s performance,
            with potentials, strengths and weaknesses, is a matter of the gravest importance to the Air
            Force, as well as to the individual officer. Performance reports constitute the most impor-
            tant single source of information for selection and assignment of people to do the work of
            the Air Force.
            1.7.2.2.5. Core Values. Integrity First, Service Before Self, Excellence in All We Do
            1.7.2.2.6. Current Events. Staying abreast of current events helps completes the "Whole
            Person" concept.
  1.8. Administrative Procedures for Submission of Nominations:
     1.8.1. Quarterly Award Nomination Package will be submitted IAW Attachment 1-Attachment
     2 using an AF Form 1206 (most current version) with maximum number of lines, using bullet for-
