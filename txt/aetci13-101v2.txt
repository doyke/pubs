       1.3.3.14. Act as liaison or intermediary to HQ AETC/A3V and squadron Stan/Eval
       function.
       1.3.3.15. (Note: N/A 173 OSS/C2.) The OG commander determines the minimum
       number of personnel for the OG/OGV battle management function. However, the
       function should at least be manned by AFSCs 13B3C/D, 1C571, and 1C571D. OG/OGV
       personnel will:
          1.3.3.15.1. Have AWO, WD, Surveillance Technician (ST), Interface Control
          Technician (ICT) or Electronic Protection Technician (EPT) experience (BMC or
          CMR).
          1.3.3.15.2. Have instructor and Stan/Eval experience (from any MAJCOM).
          1.3.3.15.3. Be qualified as a SEE and maintain BMC (any system) in their specialty
          (AWO, WD, ST, ICT, EPT or WT).
          1.3.3.15.4. Be authorized to maintain multisystem certifications such as MCS and
          BCS-T.
          1.3.3.15.5. Be designated in writing reflecting his or her current qualifications.
1.4. Transfers.
   1.4.1. Upon permanent change of station (PCS), individuals transferring from a unit that did
   not possess like equipment will receive an initial qualification evaluation (INIT QUAL). (T-
   2)
   1.4.2. Individuals transferring from a unit (any MAJCOM) that possesses like equipment
   (for example, Modular Control System (MCS) to MCS, or Tactical Display Framework
   (TDF) to TDF), will retain current qualifications after meeting the requirements specified in
   the local unit directives. However, prior to performing operations duties unsupervised at a
   new unit, they must meet the following requirements (T-2):
       1.4.2.1. Satisfactorily complete training requirements directed by AETCI 13-101
       Volume 1, Battle Management Training Program, and the unit DO.
       1.4.2.2. Satisfactorily complete the Stan/Eval INIT QUAL written examinations for the
       duty position.
       1.4.2.3. Have their existing qualification validated by the final approving officer to
       perform operations duties at the new unit on a newly prepared AF Form 8, Certificate of
       Aircrew Qualification. (AF Form 8 is prescribed in AFI 11-202, Volume 2, Aircrew
       Standardization/Evaluation Program.)
AETCI13-101V2 27 MAY 2014                                                                      13


          1.4.2.3.1. If a positional evaluation is not administered, transfer the applicable
          qualification data from the last positional evaluation to the front of the AF Form 8.
          The mission description area of the evaluator's remarks will indicate that this is an
          AETC validation of the individual’s qualification.
          1.4.2.3.2. The Stan/Eval function may administer a complete or partial positional
          evaluation to determine qualification.
   1.4.3. Individuals in temporary duty (TDY) status to another like unit to perform operations
   duties need only complete any MAJCOM or unit-directed training and standardization
   evaluation requirements prior to performing BMC duties unsupervised. Due to core
   similarities in software, all Tactical Display Framework based control system variants are
   considered like equipment within AETC. While personnel are TDY within AETC (e.g. 337
   ACS personnel to Kingsley Field), the host unit will recognize the TDY personnel’s'
   qualifications. Before the TDY personnel may control from host unit equipment
   unsupervised, the TDY personnel require host unit specified local area orientation (LAO) and
   system variant difference training. The LAO and difference training will be annotated in the
   individuals training folder and guest controller documentation. This does not apply for PCSs.
   For PCSs follow transfer guidance in paragraphs 1.4.1 and 1.4.2
1.5. Deviations to this Instruction. Deviations must be coordinated with HQ AETC/A3V or
NGB/A3Y (as appropriate). (T-2)
1.6. Waivers.
   1.6.1. Policy and procedures are enacted to provide for quality and consistency in training
   and evaluation. Occasionally, unique circumstances may warrant special consideration and
   possible waiver of policy provisions. At the same time, because it is important to preserve
   fidelity of training, evaluation, and policy implementation throughout the command, a
   process must be established for review of proposed waivers. Waivers that change the intent
   of the policy outlined in this instruction are not authorized without AETC/A2/3/10 (T-2)
   approval. Unless otherwise stated in this document, Wing/CCs (T-3) are the approval
   authority for individual personnel exceptions to the policy outlined in this instruction caused
   by special or unusual circumstances.
   1.6.2. AETC units will coordinate waivers through AETC/A3V. (T-2) Squadron
   commanders will submit all T-2 waiver requests through command channels in electronic
   format. (T-3) Waiver requests must provide justification why the individual or unit cannot
   comply with requirements. (T-2) Units will file a copy of approved written waivers to this
   volume according to AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management. (T-3) Approved
   waivers affecting crewmembers must be written into the Additional Comments area of the
   AF Form 8. (T-3)
   1.6.3. The OG/CC of local supplements will handle waivers to unit supplemental guidance.

        FORMAL INSPECTIONS AND INFORMAL HEADQUARTERS VISITS

2.1. Purpose. This chapter describes higher headquarters formal Stan/Eval inspections and
informal visits to subordinate units by Stan/Eval personnel. In addition, it provides procedures to
be used to establish Stan/Eval SIIs for inspection during formal Stan/Eval visits.
2.2. Formal Inspections. Formal Stan/Eval inspections will be conducted as part of AETC
inspection program conducted by AETC/IG IAW AFI 90-201/AETC Supplement, “Inspector
General Activities”.
   2.2.1. The Stan/Eval portion of the AETC IG inspections are designed to:
       2.2.1.1. Determine the effectiveness of the unit Stan/Eval program and instructor
       qualification and training programs.
       2.2.1.2. Verify aircrew compliance with published operational procedures and all
       applicable flying Special Interest Items (SII). This is independent of IG SII inspections.
       2.2.1.3. Provide feedback to commanders based on specific evaluation of the existing
       inspection criteria.
   2.2.2. The emphasis during the inspection will be to:
       2.2.2.1. Assess operations crew capability to perform the unit’s assigned mission. Assess
       this with written and positional evaluations (SPOT, INIT QUAL, recurring qualification
       evaluations [QUAL], etc.).
       2.2.2.2. Determine the effectiveness of the unit Stan/Eval program through an evaluation
       of the individual components specified in paragraph 2.5. The OG/OGV and squadron
       chief of Stan/Eval will receive complete qualification evaluations in their primary duty
       positions.
       2.2.2.3. Assess the capability of the unit SEEs to evaluate operations crewmembers.
       2.2.2.4. Verify compliance with operational procedures and provide an assessment of the
       unit's ability to perform its assigned training mission based on individual and crew
       proficiency.
   2.2.3. The following areas will be evaluated:
       2.2.3.1. Initial qualification training program (IQT).
       2.2.3.2. Continuation training (CT) program.
       2.2.3.3. Instructor upgrade program (according to HHQ-approved syllabi and local
       directives).
       2.2.3.4. Stan/Eval board (according to approved local directives).
       2.2.3.5. AF Form 847 program (according to AFI 11-215 and the AETC supplement).
       2.2.3.6. Operations administrative procedures and records.
       2.2.3.7. Operational Risk Management (ORM) procedures.
AETCI13-101V2 27 MAY 2014                                                                       15


2.3. Positional Evaluation Procedures.
   2.3.1. Minimize interference with the unit training schedule. The primary emphasis during
   the formal Stan/Eval visit will be administering positional evaluations to all individuals
   selected by the team chief.
   2.3.2. All available SEEs will receive a SEE objectivity evaluation (OBJ).
   2.3.3. The squadron and OG chiefs of Stan/Eval will receive a complete qualification
   evaluation in their primary duty position. Note this evaluation as a recurring evaluation if the
   examinee is within his eligibility period; otherwise, note the evaluation as a SPOT
   evaluation. The CC may establish a new eligibility period and evaluation due date according
   to paragraphs 4.25.10 and 4.25.11. Other unit SEEs may receive positional SPOT
   evaluations.
   2.3.4. Perform NO-NOTICE positional evaluations of a representative sample of
   crewmembers. Make every effort to evaluate a cross section of supervisors and experienced
   and inexperienced individuals. Document each positional evaluation on AF Form 8. These
   evaluations may be noted as SPOT evaluations.
   2.3.5. Individuals who are multi-qualified may be subject to positional evaluations in each
   duty position.
   2.3.6. Unit SEEs will administer positional evaluations while receiving an objectivity
   evaluation from a HHQ SEE (T-2). The unit SEE will select, brief, and coordinate the
   individual’s qualification evaluation scenario (T-2). The examinee will perform all mission
   planning (T-2). This constitutes an evaluation of the unit examinee, the unit SEE's
   objectivity, and the unit's positional evaluation procedures and profiles. When an objectivity
   evaluation is conducted, include both the evaluation of the unit SEE and the evaluation of the
   unit examinee in the visit results.
   2.3.7. Administer positional evaluations to individuals by notifying the unit DO immediately
   prior to the mission briefing (if the individual is already scheduled to work on position) or by
   requesting an individual be added to the next day's schedule for this purpose.
2.4. Academic Testing. Academic testing will evaluate general systems knowledge and
knowledge of operational procedures.
   2.4.1. Academic examination procedures follow. HHQ will:
      2.4.1.1. Dictate the composition and total number of questions in the examination.
      Derive questions from the general knowledge and local procedures MQF.
      2.4.1.2. Notify the unit of test requirements in a formal notification message. The unit
      will develop four written tests from the MQF test bank according to direction in the
      formal notification message. The unit will forward the tests to HHQ NLT 30 days prior to
      the formal visit.
      2.4.1.3. Analyze examination results to evaluate the overall systems knowledge of unit
      personnel.
      2.4.1.4. Pass/fail criteria are the same as for qualification examinations.
 16                                                            AETCI13-101V2 27 MAY 2014


       2.4.1.5. Formal visit examination results may be used for qualification evaluation written
       examination credit if the examination is administered within the eligibility period.
   2.4.2. All BMC operations personnel available for duty will test unless excused by the team
   chief. (T-2) Attached personnel will test during the inspection. (T-2)
       2.4.2.1. Available for duty does not include those on leave, TDY, or restricted to quarters
       or hospital.
       2.4.2.2. Test individuals who are multi-qualified in their primary duty position as
       identified by the DO.
       2.4.2.3. BMC personnel in upgrade training for another duty position will test in their
       primary BMC position.
       2.4.2.4. Do not assign positional or instructor duties to BMC qualified individuals who
       fail the academic written examination during the formal Stan/Eval visit until they have
       had time to study and complete the re-examination. (T-2) A minimum of 24 hours must
       elapse before administering a re-examination to allow for an adequate period to study.
       (T-3) If a qualified individual fails a re-examination, the SEE that administers the re-
       examination will document the re-examination failure on an AF Form 8 and treat the
       failure as an unqualified SPOT evaluation according to paragraph 2.4.2.6. (T-3) Failure
       of the re-examination will result in (T-2):
           2.4.2.4.1. A loss of qualification.
           2.4.2.4.2. A downgrade to unqualified (UQ) status and placement in remedial
           training.
           2.4.2.4.3. The requirement for a complete qualification evaluation to regain BMC
           qualification.
       2.4.2.5. The academic test rating criteria is included in Attachment 2.
       2.4.2.6. Although the academic test is an academic SPOT evaluation, an AF Form 8 is
       only required for those individuals who fail the written re-examination. Document re-
       examination failures as an unqualified SPOT evaluation. (T-3)
2.5. Informal Visits. HHQ personnel will periodically visit units possessing equipment in
which they maintain qualification. The purpose of these visits is to maintain system currency,
provide feedback and cross tell to the units, and exchange information. These visits will be
conducted on an informal basis and will not result in a visit report. HHQ may, at the request of
the DO or chief of the Stan/Eval function, administer prior notice/no-notice positional
evaluations during these visits.
   2.5.1. Scheduling. Coordination will be made through the unit DO to ensure sortie and
   equipment availability.
2.6. SAVs. IAW AFI 90-201/AETC Supplement, SAVs may only be requested by Wg/CCs to
the functional area or directed by AETC/CC or CV. Purpose is to provide problem-solving
assistance when necessary or address specific areas of interest or concern. A SAV report will be
completed for these visits. This SAV report should identify problems and provide
recommendations for any additional assistance.

                                         EVALUATIONS

Section 4A—Introduction

4.1. General. This chapter establishes procedures for conducting battle management
qualification evaluations. Not only are the majority of AETC personnel live mission qualified in
a specific system and duty position, but they are also qualified as formal course positional
instructors (PI). PIs may be qualified as live instructors, simulation instructors, or both.
   4.1.1. Basic qualified (BQ) refers to the qualification status of an individual who has
   successfully completed IQT and an INIT QUAL.
   4.1.2. Basic Mission Capable (BMC) BMC refers to the mission status of an individual, who
   has satisfactorily completed Initial Qualification Training (IQT) and Battle Management
   Instructor Training (BMIT), but does not maintain Combat Mission Ready (CMR) status.
   BMC crewmembers do not maintain CMR status due to duty assignment or other reasons as
   determined by the appropriate authority. These individuals will accomplish training
   requirements according to AETCI 13-101, Volume 1 and complete an evaluation as detailed
   in this publication prior to performing operational duties in a live environment unsupervised.
   (T-2)
   4.1.3. The battle management Stan/Eval program utilizes different types of evaluations to
   ensure qualification of personnel and standardization of operations. SEEs will use the
   policies, procedures, and evaluation criteria in this instruction for conducting all positional
   evaluations. SEEs will use qualification ratings detailed in this instruction, which are
   reflective of standard AETC flying training ratings found in AFI 11-202, Volume 2, Aircrew
   Standardization/Evaluation Program as well as AFI 13-1 Stan Eval Volume 2. An overall
   rating of Qualification Level 3 (Q3) and unqualified status could result from an
   unsatisfactory rating of single critical or multiple noncritical areas. Specific criteria are listed
   in the individual chapters or areas. SEEs may use the AF Form 4144, Positional Evaluation
   Checklist, or a locally developed form (such as the sample form in Attachment 5) to initially
   document all evaluations.

Section 4B—BQ and PI

4.2. BQ Overview. BQ is a status gained thru evaluations that are conducted to ensure an
individual is proficient in performing operations duties unsupervised on a specific system and
duty position in a live flying environment. The methods for determining the examinee's level of
job knowledge and proficiency for BQ are academic testing and positional evaluation.
4.3. Evaluation Procedures
   4.3.1. Individuals must successfully complete an INIT QUAL after IQT to gain BQ status.
   (T-2) To successfully complete a BQ evaluation, the examinee must demonstrate to the SEE
   the knowledge and ability to do assigned functions safely and effectively.
AETCI13-101V2 27 MAY 2014                                                                       21


   4.3.2. All BQ personnel must successfully complete the recurring QUAL evaluation to
   maintain BMC status. (T-2) Recurring qualification evaluations for BMC personnel consist
   of a BQ positional evaluation, instructor evaluation as applicable, and a written examination.
   4.3.3. Failure of a QUAL evaluation results in a downgrade to unqualified (UQ) status for
   qualified individuals. Individuals downgraded to UQ status will be supervised by an
   instructor in that crew position and will be assigned remedial training. (T-2) All remedial
   training must be completed prior to a re-evaluation (RECHECK). (T-2)
   4.3.4. A QUAL evaluation will update an individual's evaluation due date only when it is a
   complete evaluation resulting in a Q2 or better. A complete evaluation requires the examinee
   accomplish all written examinations and a positional evaluation over all applicable areas
   listed by the appropriate criteria. (T-2)
   4.3.5. Document all qualification evaluations on AF Form 8 according to Chapter 5 of this
   instruction. (T-2)
   4.3.6. All areas of evaluations used to determine BQ status may be conducted off-station at
   any AETC battle management unit. SEEs will make the determination if further evaluation is
   required once back on home station IAW paragraph 4.12.4. (T-2)
4.4. PI Overview. All individuals maintaining live and/or simulation positional instructor
qualification must complete initial and recurring instructional capability evaluations. (T-2) The
evaluation will assess their judgment, technical knowledge, instructor ability (including error
analysis of student activity), and use of grading documents as well as proficiency in their
specialty (AWO, WD, WT, etc.). (T-2)
4.5. PI Evaluation Procedures
   4.5.1. After completion of a formal AETC instructor program, SEEs will perform an initial
   positional instructor evaluation (IPIE) on PIs in an area representative of their instructor
   duties. (T-2) IPIEs will be accomplished on actual instructional missions whenever possible.
   The instructional mission should utilize students that are reflective of the instructor’s normal
   duties (e.g. international students for BCS-I PIs, USAF students for BCS-T PIs).
   Subsequently, evaluate personnel designated as PIs on their ability to instruct during QUALs
   to maintain PI status. (T-2) If BMC qualified, the PI QUAL will be given concurrently with
   the QUAL (T-2) (Note: the QUAL portion of the evaluation will be given prior to the PI
   portion). If not BMC qualified, the individual will still require a PI QUAL according to the
   timelines specified in Section 4C. (T-2) SEEs may require the evaluatee to present verbal
   explanations of equipment operations, procedures, and techniques pertinent to the evaluatee's
   crew position and PI responsibilities. Note: Individuals (MAJCOM excluded) who are
   multisystem certified may be evaluated on both systems during their recurring evaluations.
   Example- the QUAL portion of their evaluation on one system and the positional instructor
   evaluation on the second system (Airmanship is not considered multisystem and requires a
   separate PI QUAL, per chapter 9).
   4.5.2. All areas of PI QUALs may be conducted off-station at any AETC battle management
   unit. SEEs will make the determination if further evaluation is required once back on home
   station IAW paragraph 4.12.4. (T-2)

Section 4C—Types of Basic Evaluations

4.6. INIT QUAL
   4.6.1. The INIT QUAL is a positional and written evaluation given to determine an
   individual’s qualification status. Complete this evaluation within 30 days (2 UTAs) after the
   unit Chief of Training (COT) has certified an individual's training is complete. NOTE: INIT
   QUALs may be given by any SEE or flight examiner (FE); they are not restricted to CCV
   duties.
   4.6.2. The INIT QUAL written examinations will be successfully completed before
   beginning the positional evaluation. (T-3)
   4.6.3. The positional evaluation is complete when all applicable tasks defined in this
   publication are accomplished to include additional training (AT).
   4.6.4. Both the written examination and positional evaluation will be conducted with prior
   notice. (T-2)
   4.6.5. Designate individuals who successfully complete INIT QUAL as BQ (and BMC)
   and/or PI (simulation or live) as applicable, enter them into CT and add to the Letter of Xs
   (Letter of Xs is optional for 173 OSS/C2). (T-3)
   4.6.6. CCV will notify the COT, DO, and CC of any failure of INIT QUAL written exams.
   (T-2) Do not schedule the individual for a reexamination for a minimum of 24 hours to allow
   time for additional study. (T-3) Failure of the reexamination results in an overall rating of
   “Q3” for the evaluation.
   4.6.7. Failure of the positional evaluation requires individual to be returned to training for
   remedial training according to AETCI 13-101, Volume 1. The individual must accomplish
   the entire positional portion of the INIT QUAL once released to Stan/Eval. (T-2)
   4.6.8. Consecutive failures of an INIT QUAL require individual be returned to training and
   referral to squadron commander for administrative action according to AFI 11-402, Aviation
   and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges; or AFI 36-2101, Classifying
   Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted). (T-2)
   4.6.9. Successful completion of INIT QUAL establishes an expiration date and eligibility
   period. (T-2)
4.7. QUAL
   4.7.1. The QUAL is an academic and positional evaluation required for an individual to
   maintain BMC and (or) PI qualification.
   4.7.2. The written examination (if applicable) and positional evaluation may be given in any
   order. The written examination may be administered anytime during the eligibility window,
   however, it must be administered NLT 30 days after the first positional event is completed.
   4.7.3. The positional evaluation is complete when all applicable tasks in this publication are
   accomplished to include AT.
   4.7.4. Successful completion establishes a new expiration date and eligibility period.
AETCI13-101V2 27 MAY 2014                                                                     23


   4.7.5. When an individual fails the written evaluation, the chief of Stan/Eval will
   immediately notify the unit CC, DO and COT. (T-2) The COT will place the individual in
   non-basic mission capable (N-BMC) status. (T-2) Do not schedule the individual for
   positional duties until he has had time for study (minimum 24 hours) and has completed the
   re-examination. (T-2) Until a re- examination is accomplished, individuals in N-BMC status
   may only perform positional duties when supervised by an instructor for that duty position.
   (T-2) A successful re-examination and completion of the positional evaluation will result in a
   return to BMC status. Failure of the re-examination will result in an overall rating of “Q3”
   for the evaluation. (T-2)
   4.7.6. Failure of the positional evaluation will result in an overall rating of “Q3.”
   4.7.7. An overall rating of “Q3” will result in a downgrade to UQ status, assigned remedial
   training, and the individual must be supervised by an instructor in that crew position if
   performing positional duties. (T-2)
   4.7.8. Handle remedial training according to AETCI 13-101, Volume 1.
4.8. RECHECK
   4.8.1. A RECHECK is a prior notice qualification evaluation given to an individual who
   failed an INIT QUAL, a QUAL, a SPOT eval, or in some cases a supplementary eval. (Note:
   Failure of a QUAL results in downgrade to UQ status.)
   4.8.2. Complete the RECHECK within 30 days (2 UTAs) from the release of the remedial
   training date. (T-3)
   4.8.3. The RECHECK of an individual who failed a QUAL will concentrate on the specific
   scenario or events that resulted in the “Unqualified” rating unless a complete RECHECK is
   deemed necessary by the squadron commander. (T-3) In all cases, the SEE will evaluate and
   rate each task the examinee performs during the course of the re- evaluation. Document the
   results on a separate AF Form 8 as a “RECHECK.” (T-3)
   4.8.4. Successful completion establishes a new expiration date and eligibility period based
   on the month in which the RECHECK was completed. Specific SPOT eval exceptions exist
   and are outlined in 4.24.4. of this publication.
   4.8.5. Failure of a RECHECK will be viewed as a serious lack of proficiency. Enter the
   comments in the "Additional Comments" paragraph of the examiner's remarks section on the
   AF Form 8. (T-3)The squadron commander and DO will consider the examiner's comments.
   Within 14 calendar days or 1 UTA, the squadron commander will decide whether an
   additional RECHECK will be administered or if proceedings will be initiated to remove the
   individual's AFSC according to AFI 36-2101 and AFI 11-402. (T-3)
   4.8.6. If a decision is made to conduct a second RECHECK, it will be a complete
   qualification evaluation consisting of both the written examinations and the positional
   evaluation. Failure of a second RECHECK requires AFI 36-2101 and AFI 11-402
   proceedings.
4.9. Re-qualification Evaluations (RQ QUAL)
   4.9.1. RQ QUAL evaluations are used to requalify:
 24                                                              AETCI13-101V2 27 MAY 2014


   4.9.2. Previously qualified crewmembers returning to a battle management system IAW
   AETCI 13-101 Volume 1.
   4.9.3. Crewmembers that have become unqualified due to failure to meet lookback
   (exceeding 180 days).
   4.9.4. Due to Commander Directed Downgrade for demonstrated lack of ability/proficiency.
   4.9.5. Crewmembers who fail to complete their required periodic evaluation within the
   allotted 17 months.
   4.9.6. Failure to complete a recurring evaluation prior to the end of the 30 day window once
   an evaluation has started. NOTE: In cases of individuals who fail to complete a recurring
   evaluation prior to the end of the 30 day window, no remedial training is required and a RQ
   QUAL evaluation will be accomplished within the next 30 days. (T-3)
4.10. Additional Training
   4.10.1. AT is required for all critical tasks rated unsatisfactory (U). (T-2)
   4.10.2. SEEs may recommend AT for noncritical areas rated Q-, or they may choose to only
   debrief (see 4.10.3).
   4.10.3. SEEs will normally recommend AT for noncritical areas rated U. However, it is not
   required for non-critical areas if the assignment of such action will not constructively
   improve the examinee's performance. In such cases, corrective action by the SEE must
   include a thorough debrief of the examinee. (T-2) The SEE will enter the word "debriefed" in
   the discrepancies paragraph of the “Examiner’s Remarks” on AF Form 8. (T-3) This
   authority must be judiciously exercised.
   4.10.4. For all areas that have AT assigned, SEEs will debrief the examinee's supervisor,
   COT, CC, and DO. (T-2)
   4.10.5. Prescribed AT will be specific, accomplished, and documented according to Air
   Force training directives and Chapter 5 of this instruction. (T-2)
4.11. Failure to Complete or Pass a Written Examination or Positional Evaluation
   4.11.1. Failure to complete recurring evaluation requirements within the eligibility period (3-
   month window) will result in a loss of qualification (RQ QUAL or sim positional instructor,
   as applicable) until a complete re-qualification is successfully conducted. (T-2) The Chief of
   Stan/Eval will notify the DO, CC, and the COT if an individual does not complete written
   examination or positional evaluation requirements during the specified eligibility period. (T-
   3)
   4.11.2. Downgrade individuals who fail to pass a QUAL to UQ status in that position. (T-2)
   These individuals will not perform positional duties except under the direct supervision of an
   instructor in the same crew specialty. (T-2) (NOTE: Individuals failing to pass an INIT
   QUAL are returned to training and must complete another INIT QUAL).
   4.11.3. Place individuals who fail a written examination in N-BMC status (returned to
   training for initial evaluations if they fail twice). (T-2) These individuals will not perform
   positional duties except under the direct supervision of an instructor in the same crew
AETCI13-101V2 27 MAY 2014                                                                       25


   specialty. (T-2) Downgrade individuals failing the re-examination to UQ status in that
   position. (T-2)
   4.11.4. Individuals receiving an overall "Q3" rating on a qualification evaluation must
   satisfactorily complete a RECHECK before regaining qualified status. (T-2) Examinees who
   fail to complete the RECHECK within the time limits require a MAJCOM waiver. These
   individuals may only continue to perform positional duties under the direct supervision of an
   instructor until the waiver is approved. (T-2)
   4.11.5. Multi-qualified individuals receiving a "Q3" overall rating on a qualification
   evaluation which serves as a prerequisite for a supervisory certification (e.g. Senior Director,
   Squadron Duty Officer, Safety Monitor) will be decertified) in that supervisory position. (T-
   2) Note: Instructors downgraded to UQ status will lose their instructor rating and must
   complete a positional RQ QUAL, positional instructor evaluation, and be reappointed as an
   instructor by the DO before resuming duties as an instructor. (T-2)

Section 4D—Evaluation Structure

4.12. Positional Evaluation Requirements. Minimum positional evaluation requirements for
qualification evaluations are detailed in subsequent chapters of this instruction.
   4.12.1. Base outlines on evaluation criteria and tailor them to match the minimum scenario
   requirements specified. They will include the minimum events, procedures, and details
   necessary to ensure that a complete evaluation is accomplished for both the live and
   simulated environment (if required). (T-2)
   4.12.2. If using simulation equipment, specify specific scenarios. (T-2) Simulation
   evaluation scenarios most readily available and commonly used are those created and
   approved for formal student training. These do not require documented CCV approval to be
   used in evaluations.
   4.12.3. Include unit procedures for the conduct of these evaluations in a unit-developed
   document. (T-2) This may be a unit-developed checklist, SEE's guide, or a supplement to this
   instruction. As a minimum, these procedures will include SEE and examinee responsibilities
   and information that the SEE will furnish to the examinee. (T-2)
   4.12.4. (337 ACS only) Airmanship evaluations are considered Positional Instructor
   evaluations only.
   4.12.5. As feasible, AWO/WD evaluations will be conducted using the following precedence
   of resources: local high performance (HP) sortie on unit equipment; off-station HP sortie on
   local equipment; MU-2 sortie (337 ACS only) and high fidelity sim.
4.13. Positional Evaluation Procedures
   4.13.1. Prior to a positional evaluation, the examiner will brief the examinee on conduct and
   purpose of the evaluation, and will ensure that the examinee is familiar with the evaluation
   criteria. (T-2) The SEE will schedule all evaluations and obtain coordination to ensure
   adequate assets (live or simulated) are available to complete the evaluation. (T-2)
   4.13.2. During the positional evaluation, the SEE will determine the examinee's performance
   for each area according to criteria specified in this regulation. (T-2) Emphasis will be on
 26                                                           AETCI13-101V2 27 MAY 2014


   deviations from prescribed tolerances or critical areas of the criteria noted during the
   positional. (T-2) The examiner will not use trick questions or unrealistic compounding of
   emergencies or problems during the evaluation. (T-2)
   4.13.3. Following the evaluation, the SEE will compare the examinee's performance with the
   criteria provided and assign an appropriate rating for each task. (T-2) The SEE will
   thoroughly debrief the examinee on all aspects of the positional evaluation to include overall
   performance, specific discrepancies, and AT recommended. (T-2) Evaluation tasks requiring
   additional training will be debriefed with the examinee's supervisor, COT, DO, and CC. If
   able, CCV should also be present at the staff debrief. (T-2)
   4.13.4. Events not covered in an evaluation mission may be observed on a subsequent
   mission as long as the following requirements are met:
      4.13.4.1. Upon completion of the first positional event, the evaluation must be completed
      within 30 days. (T-2)
      4.13.4.2. The evaluation must be completed within the eligibility window (evaluation
      eligibility zone). (T-2)
      4.13.4.3. Document such evaluations using First event/Second event, etc. formatting on
      the back side of the AF Form 8. (T-3)
4.14. Written (MQF) Examinations. Written examinations are only required for INIT QUAL
and QUAL evaluations, unless specified for PI evaluations by the squadron commander.
   4.14.1. Unit Stan/Eval functions will develop and control written examinations for each
   position. (T-2) However, when different positions are responsible for identical information,
   Stan/Eval may use the same examinations for these positions.
   4.14.2. Unit Stan/Eval will maintain two INIT QUAL/QUAL tests on file for each duty
   position. (T-2) Unit Stan/Eval must ensure that no more than 50 percent of the questions are
   duplicated between tests. (T-2) The tests will consist of 40 questions from the AETC MQF
   and 10 questions from the local procedures/system MQF, except for 607 ACS evaluations.
   (T-2) 607 ACS evaluations for the AWO and WD positions will consist of 85 questions from
   the ACC CRC Weapons MQF, 10 questions from the local procedures MQF and 5 questions
   from the AETC MQF. (T-2) 607 ACS evaluations for the ICT, EPT and ST positions will
   consist of 85 questions from the ACC CRC (ICT, EPT and SURV) MQF and 15 questions
   from the local procedures MQF. (T-2)
   4.14.3. Review all examinations for accuracy annually, as a minimum, and after any
   applicable publication changes. (T-2)
   4.14.4. Units using computer-generated examinations do not need to maintain the hard copy
   examinations referenced above provided the following restrictions are observed:
      4.14.4.1. Individual examinations, to include re-examinations, are randomly generated
      from the MQF and unit- developed questions.
4.15. Written Examination Administration Procedures
   4.15.1. The minimum passing grade for any MQF examination is 85 percent (except for
   compliance with academic instructor requirements IAW AETCI 36-2604). (T-2)
AETCI13-101V2 27 MAY 2014                                                                     27


   4.15.2. Grade all examinations prior to the individual's next scheduled period for performing
   operations duties. Critique examinations to 100 percent. (T-2)
   4.15.3. Failure of the written examination twice will result in return to training status for
   individuals attempting initial upgrade. (T-2)
   4.15.4. For individuals currently BMC qualified, failure of the written examination results in
   placement in N-BMC “status” and requires a re-examination. (T-2)
   4.15.5. When an individual fails a written examination, notify the unit CC, DO and COT in
   writing. The notification will state that the individual may only perform positional duties
   when supervised by an instructor in that crew position and also requires a re-examination.
   Conduct required training according to AETCI 13-101, Volume 1. (T-2)
   4.15.6. A minimum of 24 hours must elapse before a re-examination may be administered to
   allow for an adequate period of study. (T-2) Use an alternate examination. (T-2)
   4.15.7. Accomplish re-examinations within 30 days (2 UTAs) after the COT or
   noncommissioned officer in charge has certified that the individual is ready for the re-
   examination. (T-2)
   4.15.8. Failure of the re-examination will result in an overall rating of “Q3” for the
   qualification evaluation and a downgrade to UQ. (T-2)
   4.15.9. Maintain examination answer sheets through the end of the current quarter and the
   AF Form 8 is signed by the final approving officer (whichever occurs first) for trend
   reporting purposes. (T-2) Electronic storage methods are also approved.
4.16. Security. Stan/Eval personnel must maintain positive control of all examinations. To
prevent compromise when not in use, secure examinations and answer keys in a locked
container. (T-2)
4.17. MQF. The MQF is a set of questions applicable to crew duty positions and is based on the
weapons system or unit mission and local procedures. The MQF is the question bank used for
developing INIT QUAL and QUAL written examinations. The questions are derived from
operational publications and MAJCOM training materials. This question file and source
instructions will be accessible to all unit operations personnel.
   4.17.1. Responsibilities. The responsibility for ensuring that MQFs contain current and
   essential test questions is shared by all users.
       4.17.1.1. HQ AETC/A3V policy OPR is responsible for:
          4.17.1.1.1. Approving recommended changes, additions, and deletions to the MQF.

         necessary to ensure they are accurate and current.
         4.17.1.2.3. Ensuring ACC CRC MQF is available to 607 ACS.
     4.17.1.3. Each OGV is the unit point of contact for input of all proposed changes or
     updates to MQFs. OGV will submit, through channels, suggested changes from these
     reviews and any new proposed questions that result from new operations directives. (T-2)
     4.17.1.4. Each squadron CCV will (T-2):
         4.17.1.4.1. Develop and control tests used for written examinations.
         4.17.1.4.2. Administer and grade written tests.

         NLT 30 November.
         4.17.1.4.5. Conduct semiannual MQF testing. Units are required to conduct semi-
         annual MQF testing only if there were any academic testing failures during the last
         formal inspection. Tests will consist of 40 general knowledge MQF questions and 10
         local procedures/system MQF questions; procedures described in paragraph 4.14
         apply to semiannual MQF testing, as well as initial or recurring evaluations. With
         MAJCOM approval, units may substitute open-book tests using questions derived
         from syllabus, wing/squadron standards, mission guides, etc. Results of semi-annual
         MQF testing, if required, will be forwarded to AETC/A3V.
  4.17.2. Review and Update Procedures:
     4.17.2.1. Stan/Eval functions will continually monitor applicable sections of the MQFs
     for necessary updates. They will accomplish periodic reviews at least annually. (T-2)
     4.17.2.2. The unit chief of Stan/Eval is authorized to make corrections, change spelling,
     or correct erroneous or invalid questions resulting from recent changes to systems and
     (or) operational procedures to MQFs. Submit these corrections in writing through
     Stan/Eval channels to HQ AETC/A3V within 10 days after implementation. (T-2) Submit
     new questions resulting from revisions or changes to directives to HQ AETC/A3V for
     approval prior to implementation. (T-2)
  4.17.3. Classification Guidelines:
     4.17.3.1. The overall classification of the MQF is determined by the highest
     classification of its contents.
     4.17.3.2. Classify test questions extracted from the MQF according to their classification
     in the MQF. Mark tests appropriately and protect them according to security directives.
     (T-2) Whether they contain classified questions or not, handle the tests as controlled
     items. (T-2)
AETCI13-101V2 27 MAY 2014                                                                      29


4.18. Examination Questions
   4.18.1. Question Sources. Examination questions will focus on information that is necessary
   for safe, effective mission accomplishment. Emphasize systems and operational procedures
   knowledge that the crewmember must immediately recall while performing operational
   duties. (T-2) Also, key information from publications not immediately available on position
   will be subject to testing.
   4.18.2. Construction of Questions
       4.18.2.1. Write examination questions in a manner that measures knowledge of the
       correct information at the desired level of knowledge.
       4.18.2.2. Stan/Eval written examinations may contain multiple choice (four choices
       desired with only one most correct answer), completion (fill–in–the–blank) items, or
       true/false type questions.
       4.18.2.3. Completion (fill-in-the-blank), performance, or computation questions must
       include answer parameters (for example, answer within +50 knots).
       4.18.2.4. Questions that have numerical answers will have the answers arranged in order
       from largest to smallest or vice versa.
       4.18.2.5. In general, avoid negative statements. However, if the word “not” appears in
       the question, either underline it or type it in all capital letters for attention.
       4.18.2.6. Fill-in-the-blank or matching questions, in conjunction with a map, may be
       used for questions covering local airfields, geographic points or fixes, airspace, tactical
       air navigation points, or radar and flying units.
       4.18.2.7. Local procedures questions may encompass:
           4.18.2.7.1. Airspace use and coordination of air traffic control procedures.
           4.18.2.7.2. Operations instructions.
           4.18.2.7.3. Aircraft emergency procedures.
           4.18.2.7.4. Associated flying unit operating procedures, where applicable.
           4.18.2.7.5. Weapons and tactics, as appropriate. However, if used, weapons and
           tactics questions should be applicable to the performance of unit-specific operational
           duties.
           4.18.2.7.6. Unit procedures (for example, squadron instructions).

Section 4E—Timing of Evaluations

4.19. Expiration. Qualification evaluations expire on the last day of the 17th month following
the successful completion of the INIT QUAL or QUAL. This is the expiration date of
qualification. For example, if the initial, RECHECK or recurring positional evaluation was
completed 15 March 2011, the recurring qualification evaluation must be accomplished by 31
August 2012. To the max extent possible, recurring basic qualification and instructor positional
evaluations are accomplished concurrently. (T-2)
 30                                                             AETCI13-101V2 27 MAY 2014


4.20. Eligibility Window. The evaluation eligibility period is the 3-months prior to the
evaluation due date. The written examination and positional evaluation may be administered
anytime within the 3-month eligibility period. The written examination and positional evaluation
may be given in any order (Exception: INIT QUALs require the written examination to be
administered first). Both the written and positional portions of the evaluation must be completed
within 30 days (2 UTAs) after completion of the first positional event. (T-2) For the example in
paragraph 4.18, administer the next written and positional evaluation any time between 1 June
and 31 August 2012. Complete all requirements for the recurring qualification evaluation within
the eligibility period. (T-2)
   4.20.1. Extended Evaluations. Squadron commanders may extend the expiration date of
   QUALs up to 4 months for the following reasons:
       4.20.1.1. Individuals will be assigned PCS or permanent change of assignment (PCA) to
       a unit that does not possess the same mission equipment.
       4.20.1.2. Individuals will be separating or retiring from the service.
       4.20.1.3. Individual is in DNIC/DNIF status.
       4.20.1.4. Extended TDY/deployment (Note: not to be used as a management scheduling
       tool). NOTE: Extensions beyond 4 months require AETC/A3V approval. Document such
       extensions with a memorandum for record (MFR) placed in the individual's flight
       evaluation folder (FEF) on top of the affected AF Form 8.
   4.20.2. If a recurring evaluation is not completed prior to the end of the eligibility period,
   downgrade the examinee to UQ status and complete a RQ QUAL within 30 days of release
   from remedial training. The SEE will include a short explanation of the circumstances
   surrounding the late evaluation on the AF Form 8. Enter this statement in Section IV,
   Comments. Update the recurring qualification evaluation due date when a complete
   qualification evaluation is accomplished.
   4.20.3. No-notice Evaluations:
       4.20.3.1. Use the no-notice evaluation program as a management tool to evaluate
       crewmembers on an unscheduled basis. (T-2)
       4.20.3.2. Distribute no-notice evaluations proportionately among crew positions. (T-2)
       4.20.3.3. Do not conduct INIT QUALs, initial positional instructor evaluations, and
       RECHECKs as no- notice. (T-2)

Section 4F—Grading

4.21. Rating Policies
   4.21.1. To receive an overall qualified rating (Qualification Level 1[Q1] or Qualification
   Level 2 [Q2]) on a qualification evaluation, the individual must demonstrate the ability to
   correctly perform positional duties, successfully complete required missions, and operate unit
   equipment safely and effectively during the evaluation. (T-2)
   4.21.2. All areas required for a specific qualification specified in the applicable criteria
   volume must be rated for an initial or recurring qualification evaluation to be complete. (T-2)
AETCI13-101V2 27 MAY 2014                                                                        31


   If the evaluation constitutes a RECHECK, all AT must be completed prior to the RECHECK
   evaluation, and if required, those areas being reevaluated must be rated as well as any other
   areas observed. (T-2) Rate all areas observed during the SPOT evaluation. (T-2)
   4.21.3. When sortie availability does not allow for a complete evaluation of all mission
   events during an initial or recurring qualification positional evaluation, the events not
   performed may be completed using simulation equipment (Distributed Training Operations
   Center (DTOC) /Distributed Mission Operations Center (DMOC)/Full Mission Trainer
   (FMT). However, at a minimum, evaluate weapons personnel on a live air-to-air mission. (T-
   2) The mission description entered on AF Form 8 will indicate any missions evaluated using
   simulation equipment. (T-3)
   4.21.4. When a required area cannot be evaluated on position due to equipment limitations,
   operational requirements, or weather conditions, the area may be rated through using training
   devices or oral examination. SEEs will make every effort to evaluate all required areas on
   position before resorting to this provision. If this provision is used, include an explanation in
   the “Remarks” section of AF Form 8 stating the reasons an area was not rated on position
   and the method of evaluation. (T-3) This provision is not applicable to the mission events
   required for the completion of a weapons evaluation. Simulation profiles may be those
   already approved for use in formal student training or created and approved by CCV based
   on a need for a specific level of activity and difficulty for the simulation evaluation. The
   SEE's judgment will be the determining factor in the effective use of the simulation. (T-2)
   The SEE may declare either the simulated evaluation or a particular event non-effective if the
   simulation scenario does not meet requirements due to unforeseen circumstances (equipment
   failure, simulation error, etc.).
   4.21.5. For all initial and recurring qualification evaluations, conduct a complete positional
   evaluation. (T-2) This is true even if a critical area is rated U prior to the completion of all
   areas. The only reason to terminate any positional qualification evaluation before all areas
   have been observed or rated is a compromise of flight safety.
   4.21.6. When safety of flight is jeopardized, the SEE will take immediate corrective action
   and terminate the evaluation or the mission, as appropriate. (T-2) A safety of flight deviation
   will result in an overall rating of qualification level 3 (Q3). (T-2) Explain the discrepancy on
   AF Form 8. (T-3)
   4.21.7. If a U area rating is given in a critical area, the SEE must give an overall rating of
   Q3. (T-2)
4.22. Overall Qualification Levels. There are three possible overall qualification levels that
can be awarded based on an individual's performance. They are qualification level 1 (Q1),
qualification level 2 (Q2), and qualification level 3 (Q3). (See paragraph 4.21.4 for rating
deviations.) The standards for awarding each qualification level are as follows:
   4.22.1. Q1. Evaluators will award a Q1 rating when the examinee has demonstrated desired
   performance and knowledge of procedures, equipment, and directives within specified limits
   and tolerances. The examination may have areas rated as debriefed as long as the examinee
   did not have any deficiencies that required AT or imposed restrictions. If the individual has
   demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in all phases of the evaluation, he or she can
 32                                                              AETCI13-101V2 27 MAY 2014


   receive an exceptionally qualified (EQ) annotation. The evaluation must be free of
   discrepancies, and the requisite written examination score must be a 96 percent or higher.
   4.22.2. Q2. A Q2 rating is awarded when the examinee demonstrates the ability to perform
   duties in a safe manner, but one of the following conditions exist: an area is assigned AT, or
   a grade of U is given in a noncritical area and no AT is assigned. The examinee is considered
   fully qualified and may still perform BMC and instructor duties while completing any
   assigned AT unless specified otherwise on the AF Form 8.
   4.22.3. Q3. A Q3 rating is awarded anytime a U is awarded in a critical area, or in the SEE's
   judgment, there is justification based on discrepancies to award a Q-/U grade on two or more
   noncritical areas. A Q3 on an evaluation will result in a UQ status, which will require a
   RECHECK or RQ QUAL. (T-2)
   4.22.4. Rating Deviations. Evaluators will not consider momentary deviations when grading
   if the examinee applied prompt corrective action and such deviations did not impact safety of
   flight. Cumulative deviations will determine the overall rating. Regardless of performance,
   an EQ rating may not be awarded during a SPOT evaluation unless the individual chooses to
   complete all examination requirements for a recurring evaluation.
4.23. Area Grades. A three-level grading system is established for individual areas as specified
in the appropriate grading criteria of this publication. Note: Areas identified as critical will only
be graded Q or U. (T-2) The grading system is as follows:
   4.23.1. Q. This grade is the desired level of qualification. To receive this grade, the
   examinee must have demonstrated a satisfactory knowledge of all required information,
   performed duties within tolerances prescribed by this publication, and accomplished the
   assigned mission.
   4.23.2. Q-. This grade indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned tasks, but
   requires debriefing or AT as determined by the SEE. Deviations from standards did not
   jeopardize mission accomplishment. The SEE must annotate any discrepancies on AF Form
   8 as ―debriefed" or in sufficient detail to allow the examinee's AT to be focused on specific
   learning objectives. (T-3)
   4.23.3. U. This grade is assigned for any performance outside allowable parameters or
   deviations from prescribed procedures that compromise mission accomplishment. AT is
   normally required, and the SEE must annotate the AF Form 8 in sufficient detail to allow the
   examinee's AT to be focused on specific learning objectives. (T-2) In some cases, it is not
   necessary to require AT, especially if the assignment of such action will not constructively
   improve the examinee's performance. In such a case, annotate the AF Form 8 as “debriefed”.

Section 4G—Ancillary Evaluations

4.24. Supplementary Evaluations
   4.24.1. Commanders use supplementary evaluations as administrative tools to identify and
   evaluate implemented solutions to operational problems. These evaluations are most often
   administered as inspections (using specifically prepared checklists) whose results are
AETCI13-101V2 27 MAY 2014                                                                    33


  reported to the commander. The form and content of supplementary evaluations is entirely at
  the discretion of the commander.
     4.24.1.1. Commanders will determine evaluated areas. (T-2)
     4.24.1.2. The Stan/Eval function will determine the method of evaluation, is responsible
     for administrative management of data collection, and will report results as directed by
     the commander. (T-2)
  4.24.2. The focus of any supplementary evaluation should be one specific area of crew
  performance such as radio transmissions, crew pre-mission briefings, or checklist use. (These
  areas are listed as examples and are not intended to be used as mandatory areas to be
  inspected.) Specific areas of emphasis are needed so that data logged during supplementary
  evaluations may be used to identify trends or deficiencies as well as their cause.
  4.24.3. Any unit SEE may conduct supplementary evaluations. Data could be obtained
  through daily observation of crew operations, or during simulated or live exercises.
  4.24.4. The evaluation should not be all encompassing nor should it result in the assignment
  of an overall rating for any specific crewmember. Positional supplementary evaluations do
  not constitute qualification evaluations (except in cases where flight safety is compromised).
  Therefore, do not use AF Form 8 to document positional supplementary evaluation results,
  unless flight safety is compromised, then an AF Form 8 will be filed as a Commander-
  Directed Downgrade. (T-2)
  4.24.5. The unit chief of Stan/Eval will accomplish the following when a specific area is
  identified for a positional supplementary evaluation (T-2):
     4.24.5.1. Outline the specific objectives of the evaluation and ensure development of
     checklists for use by unit SEEs.
     4.24.5.2. Determine an adequate time frame in order to achieve the objectives.
     4.24.5.3. Notify operations personnel of the evaluation objectives and time frame for
     evaluation.
     4.24.5.4. Ensure unit SEEs record the results of each evaluation.
     4.24.5.5. Consolidate the information obtained during the evaluation period.
     4.24.5.6. Evaluate the results and determine if corrective actions should be
     recommended.
     4.24.5.7. Report supplementary evaluation results to the appropriate OPR through the
     CC. The report will include the objectives of the evaluation, the timeframe during which
     it was performed, discrepancies that were noted, recommended corrective action, and
     suspense dates for completion of corrective action. The unit CC approves and endorses
     all recommendations for corrective actions.
     4.24.5.8. Perform follow-up to ensure that completed corrective action was effective.
     4.24.5.9. Retain a copy of supplementary evaluation reports and checklists developed for
     at least 1 year.
 34                                                            AETCI13-101V2 27 MAY 2014


4.25. SPOT Evaluation
   4.25.1. A SPOT evaluation is an evaluation other than one used to satisfy the requirements
   of a periodic, initial instructor or RQ QUAL instructor evaluation. The evaluation may be
   No-Notice. It requires AF Form 8/8A documentation.
   4.25.2. Positional evaluations conducted during formal inspections will normally be SPOT
   evaluations.
   4.25.3. SPOT evaluations are normally limited in scope. They may consist of positional
   evaluation and (or) written examination.
   4.25.4. The positional evaluation may cover any task or combination of tasks contained in
   the applicable positional criteria. In addition to the tasks scheduled, the SEE will evaluate
   and rate each task performed by the examinee during the course of the SPOT evaluation.
   4.25.5. SPOT evaluations may be conducted with no notice.
   4.25.6. SPOT evaluations are assigned overall qualification ratings and area grades just as
   any other recurring evaluation using the levels detailed in this publication.
   4.25.7. An area grade of U in a critical area results in an overall grade of Q3. Administer a
   complete RECHECK as in paragraph 4.8. (T-2)
   4.25.8. An area grade of U in a noncritical area only requires RECHECK in the failed area.
   (T-2) However, depending on the extent of the lack of proficiency identified in the SPOT
   evaluation, the CC may recommend a complete RQ QUAL, consisting of both the written
   examination and the positional evaluation.
   4.25.9. Successful completion establishes a new expiration date and eligibility period based
   on the month in which the RECHECK was completed. Specific SPOT eval exceptions exist
   and are outlined in 4.24.4. of this publication.
   4.25.10. After a SPOT evaluation is conducted, unless the SPOT eval covers all the required
   areas and no additional evaluation is needed (e.g. formal HHQ Stan/Eval visits), the CC may
   direct the SEE to complete an additional events to meet the criteria necessary for use as a
   QUAL evaluation. This will establish a new eligibility zone and expiration date. If this option
   is used, document the circumstances in the Additional Comments section of the Form 8. (T-
   3)
   4.25.11. If a complete positional evaluation conducted outside the eligibility period is to be
   used to update an individual's Expiration Date of Qualification, complete all requirements,
   both positional and academic, within 30 days (2 UTAs). (T-2) If not completed within 30
   days, only a SPOT evaluation can be awarded for either the written or positional (whichever
   was completed).
   4.25.12. HHQ appointed examiners can administer SPOT checks at any time in any MDS.
4.26. SEE Objectivity Evaluations
   4.26.1. Stan/Eval examiner is not a qualification, it is a certification. A SEE administers an
   objectivity evaluation to determine whether another SEE is certified to administer a
   qualification evaluation. Observations, analysis, and other substantial actions are directed
   primarily at the SEE conducting the evaluation, and will not interfere with or affect the
AETCI13-101V2 27 MAY 2014                                                                       35


   individual on position except for flight safety issues. Objectivity evaluations are not a
   recurring requirement and as such may be graded on a 1or 3 rating level when given.
       4.26.1.1. A 1 rating indicates that the observed SEE complied with HHQ and local
       Stan/Eval directives, properly briefed and debriefed the examinee, correctly identified
       discrepancies, awarded the correct area and overall rating, properly documented the
       evaluation, and if required, recommended appropriate AT.
       4.26.1.2. A 3 rating is given when the observed SEE fails to satisfy the requirements of
       paragraph 4.25.1.1.
       4.26.1.3. An overall 3 grade must be given if any task area is rated U. (T-2)
   4.26.2. AETC/A3V battle management SEEs maintaining a BMC qualification may perform
   an objectivity evaluation on any battle management SEE (regardless of position). Unit chiefs
   of Stan/Eval (or designated representative) will conduct objectivity evaluations on all
   assigned SEEs.
   4.26.3. A SEE objectivity evaluation does not fulfill the requirements of a qualification
   evaluation.
   4.26.4. Document the SEE objectivity evaluation on AF Form 8 IAW Chapter 5. (T-3)
   4.26.5. AF Form 8 will be reviewed, approved, and filed in the examinee's evaluation folder
   (EF). (T-2)
   4.26.6. Commanders, AETC/A3V SEEs and unit chiefs of Stan/Eval are not authorized to
   change or to direct a change of rating (area or overall) on AF Form 8 completed by a unit
   SEE unless a valid administrative error was made.
4.27. Letter of X’s. The DOT or CCV (determined locally by the squadron) will maintain a
letter of Xs, designating the live and simulation qualifications of all unit personnel (N/A for 173
OSS/C2). (T-2) The Letter of Xs will supplement the AF Form 8 to show the specific mission
AWOs, WDs, WTs, STs, ICTs, and EPTs are qualified to conduct and or teach. (T-2) NOTE:
Airmanship evaluations are PI evaluations and not BMC evaluations. See AETCI 13-101, Vol 1
for Letter of X’s specifics.
 36                                                              AETCI13-101V2 27 MAY 2014

                              STAN/EVAL DOCUMENTATION

5.1. Purpose. This chapter directs the use and provides guidance for the completion and
maintenance of AF Forms 8 and 942, AF Forms 4144 and 3132, General Purpose (11 x 81/2).
   5.1.1. In all instances of documentation, use of electronic forms is authorized, to include use
   of Common Access Card (CAC)-enabled signatures and wholly electronic Flight Evaluation
   Folders (FEF).
       5.1.1.1. In all instances, computer-generated forms must mirror AF forms as published
       on the USAF E-Publishing web site. (T-2)
       5.1.1.2. In all instances of data entry, if an electronic form is used, the format required by
       the electronic form will be used. (T-2)
5.2. Completion of AF Form 8. Complete AF Form 8 for each INIT QUAL, QUAL,
RECHECK, RQ QUAL, SEE objectivity, and SPOT evaluation according to the following
instructions. (T-2) For date fields use a two-digit day, three-letter month and two-digit year
format (e.g. 24 Jun 13). Make basic entries according to the formats prescribed in the following
paragraphs.
   5.2.1. Date Completed. Enter the date the final positional portion of the evaluation was
   completed or the additional training if assigned. If the positional evaluation had to be
   conducted in parts, enter the date the last part was completed.
   5.2.2. Examinee Identification
       5.2.2.1. Name, Rank, and Social Security Account Number (SSAN). Abbreviated or
       non-abbreviated rank format is acceptable. Use of last four of SSAN is approved.
       5.2.2.2. Organization and Location. Use the unit designation and location that the
       examinee is assigned or attached. AETC/A3V may use their office symbol in place of the
       unit designation.
       5.2.2.3. Aircraft/Crew Position. Enter the qualification level and the position; for
       example, BMC/WD. After completing an INIT QUAL for a secondary qualification,
       annotate the AF Form 8 as BMC/WT and enter “This is the individual’s secondary
       qualification.” in Section IV on the reverse side of the AF Form 8.
           5.2.2.3.1. If an individual is instructor qualified, enter as an instructor position by
           adding an “I” to the normal designator, such as IWD (instructor weapons director).
           5.2.2.3.2. If an individual is completing a qualification for instructor, such as going
           from WD to IWD, enter IWD.
           5.2.2.3.3. If the individual is qualified in an additional position, such as a WD also
           being evaluated to qualify or re-qualify as a WT, enter the position in which the
           individual is qualifying.
           5.2.2.3.4. For objectivity evaluations, put “E” (for evaluator) and the position of the
           observed SEE.
AETCI13-101V2 27 MAY 2014                                                                  37


     5.2.2.4. Eligibility Period. Enter the 3-month period preceding the expiration date from
     the last similar evaluation (for example, if the last evaluation expires September 2008,
     enter Jul-Sep 08).
         5.2.2.4.1. Enter “N/A” (not applicable) for initial evaluations, evaluations
         accomplished outside the examinee’s normal eligibility period, SPOT evaluations and
         objectivity evaluations.
         5.2.2.4.2. Dual entries are authorized for misaligned combined evaluations (for
         example, if last instructor AWO [IAWO] evaluation expires November 2010 and
         QUAL evaluation expires January 2011, enter “IAWO: Sep-Nov 10/QUAL: Nov 10-
         Jan 11” for a combined IAWO/QUAL evaluation). If aligning a QUAL with an
         INSTR and the examinee is in the zone for an evaluation, enter “N/A” in the INSTR
         portion and the eligibility period in the QUAL portion.
  5.2.3. Section II —Qualification:
     5.2.3.1. Ground Phase:
         5.2.3.1.1. Examination/Check. Enter the title, date completed, and score of each
         examination. In the event of a failed examination with a successful re-examination,
         enter the date the examination was successfully completed with both scores. For
         example: “MQF 12 Jun 13 78/96”. Note: When an examinee passes the written
         examination but receives a “Q3” rating for the positional evaluation, AF Form 8 for
         the RECHECK will include the written examination entries from the previous AF
         Form 8, unless an entire RECHECK is required. In the event the examinee fails a re-
         examination, enter both scores and dates and enter a “3” in the unqualified block on
         the AF Form 8.
     5.2.3.2. Flight Phase:
         5.2.3.2.1. Mission/Check.
             5.2.3.2.1.1. Enter the type of check completed (QUAL, INSTR, and SPOT). This
             will be “QUAL” for all evaluations except instructor or Stan/Eval objectivity
             evaluations. For an instructor qualification, enter the word “INSTR” and the duty
             position. For Stan/Eval objectivity evaluations, enter “SPOT.”
             5.2.3.2.1.2. Prefixes. The following prefixes will be used, when applicable, to
             further describe the evaluations.
                5.2.3.2.1.2.1. Initial (INIT). The first evaluation of any type for a crew
                position or instructor qualification in an MDS, (e.g., INIT QUAL, INIT
                INSTR).
                5.2.3.2.1.2.2. RQ QUAL. An evaluation administered to remedy a loss of
                qualification due to:
                  5.2.3.2.1.2.2.1. Expiration of a required periodic evaluation. The RQ QUAL
                  will be IAW the guidance for that periodic evaluation.
                  5.2.3.2.1.2.2.2. Loss of currency that requires a RQ QUAL evaluation.
                  5.2.3.2.1.2.2.3. Commander-directed downgrade.
38                                                           AETCI13-101V2 27 MAY 2014


                  5.2.3.2.1.2.2.4. The RQ prefix will not be used to prefix a qualification
                  evaluation following a failed INIT evaluation. No qualification was
                  achieved, thus RQ QUAL is not possible.
                5.2.3.2.1.2.3. No-Notice (N/N). The no-notice evaluation program provides
                commanders a sampling of daily operations performance and an assessment of
                unit training effectiveness.
                  5.2.3.2.1.2.3.1. A no-notice evaluation is one where the examinee is
                  notified of the evaluation at or after the beginning of normal preparation for
                  the mission. The beginning of normal preparation for a mission will be
                  determined by the examiner and will be defined in supplements to this
                  instruction. The intent is to preclude extraordinary preparation for the
                  mission.
                  5.2.3.2.1.2.3.2. An examinee may utilize a no-notice evaluation to update a
                  QUAL/MSN evaluation expiration date provided all requirements for the
                  evaluation are completed within the prescribed time periods of this
                  publication. If all requirements were not completed on the first simulation or
                  live fly event, subsequent simulation or live fly events are authorized to
                  complete all required areas.
                  5.2.3.2.1.2.3.3. If the examinee chooses to utilize a N/N SPOT to update
                  his/her QUAL/MSN, document the evaluation as a N/N QUAL/MSN.
                  5.2.3.2.1.2.3.4. If the examinee elects not to update a QUAL/MSN
                  evaluation expiration date, the evaluation will be documented as a N/N
                  SPOT evaluation.
                5.2.3.2.1.2.4. Simulated (SIM). An evaluation where the positional phase
                requisite is conducted during a virtual/constructive mission scenario.
                5.2.3.2.1.2.5. Multiple Prefixes. More than one prefix may be used to
                describe an evaluation (e.g., N/N, SIM SPOT).
        5.2.3.2.2. In the “Date” column, enter the date of each session or mission needed to
        complete the evaluation. If more than one session or mission is involved to
        successfully complete an evaluation, show each session or mission on subsequent
        lines. All events will be listed in chronological order, and will correspond to multiple
        entries under mission description, Section IV.
     5.2.3.3. Qualification Level
        5.2.3.3.1. Place a “1” or “2” in the qualified block or a “3” in the unqualified block
        for the member’s overall qualification level. For SEE objectivity evaluations, enter
        "1" in the qualified block or a "3" in the unqualified block."
        5.2.3.3.2. Combined evaluations (for example, INST/QUAL, INST/QUAL/AR)
        require only one qualification level number if all parts of the evaluation were awarded
        the same qualification level grade.
        5.2.3.3.3. If the qualification levels of a combined evaluation vary, indicate the
        qualification level for each part separately (for example, “QUAL: 1” and “AR: 2” in
AETCI13-101V2 27 MAY 2014                                                                   39


        the qualified block, or “QUAL: 1” in the qualified block, and “AR: 3” in the
        unqualified block).
     5.2.3.4. Expiration Date of Qualification
        5.2.3.4.1. For evaluations that establish a new eligibility period, enter the month and
        year that is 17 months after the month in which the flight phase of the evaluation was
        successfully completed.
        5.2.3.4.2. For evaluations, to include SEE objectivity evaluations, which do not
        establish a new eligibility period, enter “N/A.”
        5.2.3.4.3. Combined evaluations require only one date if all parts of the evaluation
        were successfully completed and “N/A” if all parts were assigned an unqualified
        grade.
        5.2.3.4.4. For a combined evaluation where one component is successfully completed
        and one component is assigned an unqualified grade, indicate by assigning a new
        expiration date for those portions completed successfully, and “N/A” for those
        portions awarded an unqualified grade (e.g. the Expiration Date of Qualification
        would list “QUAL: mmm yy” under the QUALIFIED column and “INSTR: N/A” in
        UNQUALIFIED column).
     5.2.3.5. Additional Training
        5.2.3.5.1. Due Dates. If AT is required, enter the not-later-than training date. AT
        must be identified within seven days of evaluation and completed within 30 days
        once identified (2 UTAs).
        5.2.3.5.2. Date Additional Training Completed. Enter the date(s) the examinee
        completed AT. If no AT is recommended, enter “N/A.” The AF Form 8 DATE
        COMPLETED field at the top right corner should reflect the date that AT was
        completed.
        5.2.3.5.3. Certifying Official. The COT is the certifying official and will sign and
        date the AF Form 8 once all AT is complete. The SEE will not sign the permanent AF
        Form 8 prior to the Certifying Official.
     5.2.3.6. Restrictions. Place an "X" in the applicable block if comments are annotated in
     Section IV.
        5.2.3.6.1. Indicate imposed restrictions that must be completed before the individual
        can perform duties unsupervised by an instructor. List the specific restriction imposed
        in this area. For example, “Must be supervised by an instructor until accomplishment
        of a complete qualification evaluation.”
        5.2.3.6.2. Not all AT will require a restriction to be imposed. Impose a restriction
        when the individual must be supervised or must complete a requirement prior to
        performing duties unsupervised. All failed evaluations will have a restriction
        imposed.
        5.2.3.6.3. When a restriction is imposed because of an individual’s inability to
        perform certain tasks, AT will be assigned.
40                                                             AETCI13-101V2 27 MAY 2014


         5.2.3.6.4. Note restrictions on the First Line in section IV.
     5.2.3.7. Exceptionally Qualified Designation. An exceptionally qualified comment can
     be awarded when, in the judgment of the examiner, the examinee has demonstrated
     exceptional skill and knowledge in all phases of the evaluation; and the examinee has
     scored a 96 percent or higher on requisite written examination and the evaluation has no
     downgrades in any evaluated areas.
         5.2.3.7.1. Enter designation in all capital letter. Document justification for award of
         exceptionally qualified designation (e.g., areas of excellence) in Additional
         Comments inside Examiner’s Remarks, Section IV Comments.
         5.2.3.7.2. The designation can only be applied to the total evaluation; not to separate
         requisites.
     5.2.3.8. Commander-Directed Downgrade. Place an “X” in the appropriate block if
     applicable. See paragraph 5.2.6 for further guidance.
  5.2.4. Section III —Certification:
     5.2.4.1. Flight Examiner:
         5.2.4.1.1. The examiner signing Section III of the AF Form 8:
             5.2.4.1.1.1. Is responsible for the content of the AF Form 8.
             5.2.4.1.1.2. Will always place an "X" in the remarks block, and add any
             comments to the Additional Comments section inside Examiner’s Remarks,
             Section IV, or write “None”.
             5.2.4.1.1.3. Will be the first dated signature on Section III of the AF Form 8.
         5.2.4.1.2. If two or more SEEs are required to complete an evaluation, the examiner
         completing the evaluation will sign Section III of the AF Form 8. The other examiner
         will sign the back of the Form 8 for the portion of the evaluation they completed or as
         the Graduate Training Management System (GTMS) allows. If not using GTMS, and
         digital signatures are used, the Form 8 must be converted to PDF to allow a digital
         signature in Section IV.
         5.2.4.1.3. The SEE will not sign before AT was certified as completed.
     5.2.4.2. Reviewing and Final Approving Officers:
         5.2.4.2.1. Use Attachment 3 to determine the reviewing and final approving officers.
         The reviewing and final approving officers will indicate whether they concur or do
         not concur. If they do not concur or if they have remarks, they will also mark the
         “Remarks” block and enter the remarks on the back of the AF Form 8. Remarks are
         required if they do not concur. In no case will SEEs act as the reviewing or final
         reviewing officer for a positional evaluation they administered. If no comments are
         required, write in “None”. Units will not “pre-annotate” concur/non-concur or
         remarks for reviewing and final approving officers.
         5.2.4.2.2. After final approval, the examinee will review AF Form 8 and sign and
         date the form at the bottom. This signature certifies the individual has seen the form,
         been briefed on its contents, and understands his or her current qualification status
AETCI13-101V2 27 MAY 2014                                                                    41


        and any restrictions or AT that have been imposed. It does not imply agreement or

  5.2.5. Section IV—Comments. Use the following headings as applicable in the space
  provided on the reverse side of the form:
     5.2.5.1. Mission Description. The mission description should be a brief and meaningful
     narrative providing supervisors with a summary of all information pertinent to the
     mission and practical events conducted during the evaluation. This narrative should not
     use terminology or acronyms unique to a unit or location. It should include, as a
     minimum, whether a live or simulation scenario was conducted, the number and type of
     participants, type of events, and equipment limitations or problems experienced. It will
     also include the airspace, type of control provided, a summary of events conducted, and
     equipment limitations or problems experienced. This summary should not recreate the
     entire mission but provide an overview. All events will be listed in chronological order
     and prefaced with First Event, Second Event, etc.
     5.2.5.2. Discrepancies. Document discrepancies by annotating the grading area number,
     grading area title, (followed by any subarea title in parenthesis) grade awarded (Q-/U),
     annotation if discrepancy was debriefed and synopsis of discrepancy. Examiners must
     provide a detailed explanation of noted discrepancies to ensure examinee understanding.
     The discrepancy must clearly inform the supervisor of the action the examinee took or
     failed to take. If no discrepancies were noted, type “None.” If debriefing is the only
     action necessary, enter “Debriefed.” after the specific discrepancy.
     5.2.5.3. Recommended Additional Training. Recommend training to improve
     performance for discrepancies identified, other than those that were debriefed. Record the
     position or area in which the AT is required. If there is no recommendation, type “None.”
     5.2.5.4. Additional Comments. Usually an optional paragraph, comments in this section
     are restricted to significant information dealing with the examinee's performance that is
     not documented elsewhere. Efficiency report-type comments or comments comparing the
     examinee to other individuals are prohibited. Comments are mandatory for those failing a
     RECHECK and for evaluations that were not completed prior to the end of the eligibility
     period. In this case, the SEE will include a short explanation of the circumstances
     surrounding the late evaluation and will detail why a RECHECK is now required. If there
     are no comments, type in “None”.
        5.2.5.4.1. Document any commendable items under Additional Comments using the
        following format: “Commendable” followed by grading area number, grading area
        title (followed by any subarea title in parenthesis) and examiner’s description of
        commendable circumstances.
        5.2.5.4.2. If an alternate evaluation method is used to satisfy a part of the positional

        5.2.5.4.4. Incorporate the information contained in any applicable MFRs (e.g.,
        extension, waivers). MFRs become a permanent part of the FEF only when the Major
42                                                             AETCI13-101V2 27 MAY 2014


         discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by a later AF Form
         8.
     5.2.5.5. Reviewing Officer's Remarks. Any comments or exceptions to the examiner's
     remarks are indicated here or “None.”
     5.2.5.6. Final Approving Officer's Remarks. Any comments or exceptions to the
     examiner's or reviewing officer's remarks are indicated here or “None.”
     5.2.5.7. Non-concurrence by Reviewing and Final Approving Officers. The reviewing
     and final approving officers will ensure the recommended AT is adequate to correct the
     noted deficiencies. If a reviewing or final approving officer does not agree with the
     overall rating, the overall grade will not be changed. Place an “X” in the “Do Not
     Concur” block and comment in Section IV, Comments block.
  5.2.6. Commander Directed Downgrade Guidance. Any commander (squadron or above) in
  the member’s chain of command may direct a downgrade to an intermediate level of
  qualification or unqualified status without administering an evaluation under the following
  guidance:
     5.2.6.1. For flying-related cases, use for cause only, for example, breach of flight safety -
     including incidents not observed by an examiner, or observed, but by an examiner of
     another specialty.
     5.2.6.2. For non-flying related cases, do not use as a substitution for, or in lieu of,
     administrative or judicial actions. Use in cases where a member’s actions directly affect
     the commander’s confidence in the member’s ability to safely control aircraft and/or
     operate equipment.

              regain qualification.
           5.2.6.3.3. Section III. Only the commander directing the downgrade and the
           individual concerned will sign the AF Form 8. The directing commander will sign in
           the final approving officer block and “X” the remarks block.
5.3. Suspenses
   5.3.1. Temporary Qualification letters (or AF Form 8A) will be issued for all evaluations
   (INIT QUAL, QUAL, OBJ). Use the memorandum format at Attachment 4 as a temporary
   record of the qualification results. A temp QUAL letter should be generated by each
   examiner administering a portion of the eval until it is completed. Place temporary
   qualification memorandums in section II of the individual's EF within 24 hours after
   completion of the evaluation. The certificate will be signed by the SEE and the unit chief of
   Stan/Eval after his review. Temporary qualification memorandums need not be typed. Only
   one temporary qualification letter (if given by the same SEE) is required at the completion of
   the evaluation for a combined evaluation. Do not remove the temporary qualification
   certificate from the FEF until AF Form 8 is routed and complete.
   5.3.2. Each unit will develop procedures to ensure tracking of AF Form 8.
   5.3.3. Units will complete all reviews and approvals, and file the completed AF Form 8 or in
   the EF within 30 days (2 UTAs) of the completed positional evaluation.
5.4. Completion of AF Form 4144. The SEE can use this form to record the events of the
evaluation. Use it as a working copy, a guide to conduct the evaluation, or to debrief the
examinee. Maintain the form according to local procedures. If used, complete the form as
follows (T-2):
   5.4.1. Type of Evaluation. Enter the type of evaluation as initial, recurring, SPOT, instructor
   qualification, etc.

   criteria task areas. Enter an “X” in the rating box for Q, Q-, or U in each individual
   evaluation area.
   5.4.6. Remarks. This section is for SEEs use. Recommended use is as a guide for debriefing.
5.5. Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF). The FEF is designed to maintain those basic source
documents that provide a history of each individual's qualifications. An FEF must be established
for each crewmember maintaining a qualification status of BMC or positional instructor (live or
simulated). (T-2) The FEF must include the following evaluation records: AF Form 8 or AF
 44                                                             AETCI13-101V2 27 MAY 2014


Form 4143 and other computer-generated forms used to indicate qualification status. (T-2) The
organization to which the individual is assigned or attached will maintain the FEF. Individuals
assigned or attached to other than US Air Force units may use the appropriate format of the
service to which they are attached. The unit chief of Stan/Eval is responsible for maintaining the
FEF.
   5.5.1. Contents of the FEF. The FEF is comprised of two sections:
       5.5.1.1. Section 1 is on the left side of the folder. Place AF Form 3132 or AF Form 942

       2)The control mission profile must meet the minimum requirements of Paragraphs
       6.1.1.4.1 through 6.1.1.4.3 (T-2) SEEs will make the determination as to whether
       briefed/conducted control activities fulfill control requirements. The live/virtual mission
       does not have to conform to a specific profile (e.g., Offensive or Defensive Counter-air)
       if the unit is unable to schedule aircraft to conduct such a mission. During the QUAL
       evaluation, Counter-air and Air Refueling control must be evaluated. (T-2) Tasks not
       observed and assessed during the normal course of the evaluation will be evaluated
       separately while the examinee is on position. (T-2)
       6.1.1.3. The evaluation will be conducted in controlled radar and communications
       jamming environment; otherwise, radar and communications jamming may be simulated.
       (T-2) When possible, the evaluation will be conducted with a full operational crew.
       6.1.1.4. The examinee must control one Counter-air and one Air Refueling mission to
       complete the evaluation. (T-2)
          6.1.1.4.1. Counter-air missions will be conducted where weapons examinees provide
          tactical or broadcast control, with a minimum of one intercept, as briefed by the
          aircrew. (T-2) The control will be provided to at least two separate fighters/elements
          simultaneously committed against a minimum of two targets. (T-2) The examiner will
          ensure the weapons examinee participates in all phases of the mission. (T-2) NOTE:
          It is not a requirement for this mission to result in a maneuvering dogfight.
          6.1.1.4.2. Air refueling evaluations require control be provided to at least two
          separate receivers rendezvousing on one or more tankers. (T-2) The weapons
          examinee is to demonstrate a close control rendezvous. (T-2) Switch actions will be
          used at the discretion of the examinee.

  QUAL EVALUATION OF THE AIR WEAPONS OFFICER (AWO) AND WEAPONS
                          DIRECTOR (WD)

Section 7A— Evaluation Procedures and Instructions Note: This section contains criteria
applicable to AWO & WD positional evaluations, excluding CRC evaluations at the 607 ACS
unless noted otherwise.

7.1. QUAL Evaluation. The minimum event for the basic qualification is a live counter air
mission or air-to-surface mission. (T-2) The examinee must demonstrate a degree of knowledge
and proficiency essential for successful mission accomplishment, profile execution, and safety of
flight. Examinee will be evaluated on all phases of a given control mission while aircraft are on
their assigned frequency. (T-2)
7.2. Specific Profiles. WD/AWO qualification evaluations will be conducted on live missions
(to the maximum extent possible) or high fidelity sim mission (example: Network Training
Center (NTC)/Full Mission Trainer (FMT)/Distributed Mission Operations (DMO). (T-2)
Additionally, the SEE is responsible for determining whether briefed or conducted control
activities meet qualification requirements. With the exception of the air combat training or
dissimilar air combat training (air-to-air) portion of the evaluation, the missions conducted have
to conform to specific profiles as defined by the OG/OGV. (T-3) If the individual is designated
to be live air refueling (AR) certified by the squadron operations officer (DO), the evaluation
may include a live AR sortie. Live certification in AR will be annotated, using a letter of Xs. (T-
2)
   7.2.1. Live Counter-air Mission. Conduct a live air-to-air or air-to-surface mission where the
   AWO/WD provides control to high performance aircraft as briefed by the aircrew. (T-2) An
   INIT QUAL or QUAL may be conducted using general aviation contract aircraft only if it is
   representative of duties based on qualification or lookback. To meet evaluation requirements,
   missions should consist of at least two engagements or a single continuous engagement
   lasting more than 10 minutes.
       7.2.1.1. Control should be provided to fighters or elements (blue air) against adversaries
       (red air) who are cleared for evasive maneuvering. The SEE will ensure that the
       AWO/WD participate in all phases of the mission. (T-2) Another controller on a separate
       frequency may control the adversaries. The SEE will determine whether the examinee
       controls blue air or red air.
       7.2.1.2. If a mission is scheduled or degrades to a two-versus-one engagement, the SEE
       will determine the mission's suitability for an evaluation based on the workload of the
       examinee. (T-2) The SEE will determine whether the examinee controls blue air or red
       air. (T-3) A two-versus-one engagement is the minimum sufficient to meet evaluation
       requirements. (T-2)
   7.2.2. Aerial Refueling (AR) Operations.
       7.2.2.1. Conduct an AR operation where control is provided to at least one receiver. (T-
       2) The AWO/WD must demonstrate proficiency on AR tactics using the continuum of
       control dictated by the mission requirements, available equipment, weather conditions
 56                                                             AETCI13-101V2 27 MAY 2014


       and consistent with procedures outlined in ATP-56, Part 2, Annex 1. (T-2) This
       evaluation will consist of a complete AR operation, from anchor activation to the return
       of the airspace block. (T-2)
       7.2.2.2. Evaluations may be scheduled for an AR operation with more than one tanker
       (cell) or receivers. Increased difficulty level over single tanker operations does not
       prohibit the requirement to achieve rendezvous criteria outlined in Area 14, Air Refueling
       Operations Positioning.
       7.2.2.3. The examinee will have two opportunities to meet criteria for a RV Alpha or RV
       Delta rendezvous. (T-2) Failure to achieve parameters in two attempts will result in a
       rating of U for Area 14. (T-2)
       7.2.2.4. If, due to mission degradation, the examinee is unable to complete the AR, then
       they may be accomplished in the SIM/FMT using the same evaluation criteria. Annotate
       the AF Form 8 in the remarks section indicating the SIM/FMT portions of the evaluation
       that must be evaluated under live conditions for the next recurring evaluation. (T-3)
   7.2.3. Air-to-Surface Event. The AWO/WD directs at least one flight of aircraft conducting
   air-to-surface tactics against a ground objective. (T-2) Weapons personnel will provide
   tactical or broadcast control to an aircraft or flight of aircraft where flight integrity is
   maintained that enters an air-to-surface tactical engagement. (T-2) To meet mission
   requirements, the mission should consist of at least two engagements, or a single engagement
   lasting at least 10 minutes.
   7.2.4. Critical Areas. Certain areas require a degree of knowledge and proficiency absolutely
   mandatory for successful mission accomplishment. Consequently, a U rating in any of the
   following critical areas will result in an overall grade of Q3: Area 5, Crew Coordination,
   Area l6, Safety of Flight, Area 17, Aircraft Emergencies, and Area l8, Equipment Safety
   Procedures. (T-2) In addition, Area 41 (Ground Safety Hazards) and Area 42
   (OPSEC/COMSEC/Authentication) are also considered critical areas for CRC evaluations
   only and a U rating in either of those areas will result in an overall grade of Q3 for CRC
   evaluations. (T-2)
   7.2.5. Receiving a U Rating in Area 14. An examinee that receives a U rating in Area 14 is
   prohibited from conducting live AR operations unsupervised. (T-2) However, if this is the
   only area rated U, the examinee will still be qualified to perform duties on air-to-air missions.
   (T-3) The additional comments section of the AF Form 8 will contain the statement, "Not air
   refueling certified." Once the Training Requirement (TR) is complete, annotate as "air
   refueling certified." (T-2)
7.3. Evaluation Objective. The examinee must demonstrate the ability to operate safely and
effectively according to technical orders, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations,
and other operational directives. (T-2)

  BMC QUALIFICATION EVALUATION OF THE WEAPONS TECHNICIAN (WT)

Section 8A—Evaluation Procedures and Instructions

8.1. BMC. The minimum event for the BMC qualification is a live counter-air or air-to- surface
mission. (T-2) The evaluation may also include the AR operation. The examinee must
demonstrate a degree of knowledge and proficiency essential for successful mission
accomplishment and safety of flight. (T-2) Examinee will be evaluated on all phases of a given
control mission while aircraft are on their assigned frequency. (T-2)
8.2. Specific Profiles. To the maximum extent possible, the WT will be evaluated on live
missions where the AWO/WD provides control as briefed by the aircrew. The SEE is responsible
for determining whether briefs or conducts control activities meet qualification requirements.
With the exception of the air-to-air portion of the evaluation, the missions conducted have to
conform to specific profiles as defined by OG/OGV. (T-3)
   8.2.1. Live Air-to-Air Mission
       8.2.1.1. Assist in the conduct of a live air-to-air mission where the AWO/WD provides
       control as briefed by the aircrew. (T-2) To meet evaluation requirements, missions should
       consist of at least two engagements or a single continuous engagement lasting at least 10
       minutes.
       8.2.1.2. The WT must monitor fighters or elements (blue air) against adversaries (red air)
       who are cleared for evasive maneuvering. (T-2) The SEE will ensure the WT participates
       in all phases of the mission to the maximum extent possible. Another control team on a
       separate frequency may control the adversaries.
       8.2.1.3. If a mission is scheduled or degrades to a two-versus-one engagement, the SEE
       will determine the mission's suitability for an evaluation based on the workload of the
       examinee. A two-versus-one engagement is the minimum sufficient to meet evaluation
       requirements. (T-2)
   8.2.2. AR Operations
       8.2.2.1. The examinee will assist the AWO/WD in the conduct of AR operations. (T-2)
       The missions need not include specific AR rendezvous. This evaluation consists of a
       complete AR operation, from anchor activation to the return of the airspace block. (T-2)
       8.2.2.2. Evaluations may be scheduled for an AR operation with more than one tanker
       (cell) or set of receivers.
   8.2.3. Air-to-Surface Event. The examinee will assist the AWO/WD in the conduct of an air-
   to-surface mission where the AWO/WD directs at least one flight of aircraft conducting air-
   to-surface tactics against a ground objective. (T-2)

        OBJECTIVITY EVALUATION OF THE STAN/EVAL EXAMINER (SEE)

Section 13A—Evaluation Procedures and Instructions

13.1. Conducting a SEE Objectivity Evaluation
   13.1.1. All areas of the objectivity evaluation are considered critical to its success, and the
   evaluation will be graded only as 1 or 3. (T-2) A score of U in an area will result in an
   overall grade of 3. (T-2) Cumulative deviations will be considered when determining an
   overall rating of 1 or 3.
   13.1.2. Only one SEE objectivity evaluation will be required, and it will suffice for all areas
   the SEE is qualified to evaluate in. If the SEE is qualified in two systems, the objectivity
   evaluation will only be required in one system.
   13.1.3. There are no requirements to conduct an objectivity evaluation on a SEE solely
   because he or she has become certified/qualified in another system, or positional
   certification.
   13.1.4. SEEs with prior experience as evaluators from other MAJCOMs will still receive an
   objectivity evaluation. (T-2)
   13.1.5. There is no requirement for recurring objectivity evaluations.
   13.1.6. SPOT objectivity evaluations will be given at the discretion of the AETC, group, or
   squadron chiefs of Stan/Eval, and these evaluations may be given in any or all areas of the
   SEE's qualification.
13.2. Evaluation Objective. The examinee must demonstrate a thorough understanding of
Stan/Eval directives, and ensure safety of flight as well as compliance with applicable technical
orders, FAA regulations, and operational directives. (T-2)

Section 13B—Qualification Criteria

individual who is assigned to a unit which does not have a primary combat mission, but has
successfully completed IQT, passed an initial qualification evaluation, completed BMIT, and is
complying with CT requirements for a designated duty position. This individual would require
mission qualification training (MQT) training and may require some part of IQT by a combat
ready unit before entry into combat.
Basic Qualified (BQ)—The status of an individual who has successfully completed IQT and an
INIT QUAL. Individual lacks the knowledge of Joint and Combined operations procedures to
operate in a theater. Individuals in this status may perform non-combat missions without
instructor supervision.
Certification—Designation of an individual by the organization commander as having
completed required training and being capable of performing in a role, mission, job, etc., for
which no qualification training program exists. Certifications associated with squadron unique
positions have no HHQ formal training program or syllabus.
Certifying Official—A person the commander assigns to determine an individual’s ability to
perform a task to required standards.
Combat Mission Ready (CMR)—The status of an individual who successfully completes IQT
and MQT, passes initial and mission qualification evaluations, complies with CT requirements,
and is assigned to a unit with a primary combat mission.
Continuation Training (CT)—Academic and positional training required to maintain
CMR/BMC qualification.
Critical Task—These are tasks where strict adherence to procedures and directives is
mandatory; failure to satisfactorily accomplish this task directly impacts either overall mission
success or flight safety.
Currency—Currency is compliance with CT requirements and positional proficiency required
by this directive.
Downgrade—The downgrading of an individual from BMC to UQ status due to failure of any
positional evaluation, failure to complete a recurring evaluation by the scheduled date, failure to
meet annual TRs, or the unit commander determines the individual to be non-proficient.
Eligibility Period—The 3-month period prior to expiration date of the evaluation during which
an individual must complete all written and positional requirements for the recurring
qualification evaluation.
Evaluation—Verbal, written, and positional methods used to determine individual proficiency to
include positional evaluations and written evaluations as prescribed by governing directives.
Evaluation Folder (EF)—The EF contains the basic documents that show the history of an
individual’s positional qualification. Only one EF will be developed and maintained for an
individual.
AETCI13-101V2 27 MAY 2014                                                                        109


Experienced—An experienced AWO/WD is an individual who has been formally awarded a
13B3/4X/1C5X1D AFSC, has one year in the AFSC after award, performed as a CMR/BMC
AWO/WD for a minimum of 6 months and has at least 50 career controlled events while
performing in a CMR/BMC status, of which a minimum of 25 must be current assigned unit
system specific (live/DMO) controlled events. An experienced EPT/ST is an individual who has
been formally awarded a 13BXX/1C5X1 AFSC, has one year experience in the AFSC after
award, has at least 50 career event operations performing duties in a CMR/BMC status, of which
25 must be current assigned unit system specific event operations, and performed in that
particular position, as CMR/BMC, for a period of 6 months. ICTs must perform in that particular
duty position, as CMR/BMC, for a period of 6 months.
Note: Instructors may credit one mission for every two live student missions for which they were
primary instructor. Unit DOs may determine equivalent general positional hours for individuals
that were previously assigned to units that did not track event operations.
Extended Training Period—Training period designed for individuals who fail to progress into
the next phase of training
Informal Visit—This is an announced visit by HHQ SEEs to subordinate units for proficiency
training or for orientation.
Initial Qualification Evaluation (INIT QUAL)—The first evaluation given to determine an
individual’s BMC qualification status. It will consist of a positional evaluation and a written
examination.
Initial Qualification Training (IQT)—Academic and positional training required to attain
BMC status.
Instructor—A qualified or certified individual authorized to instruct other individuals in
operations academics and positional duties.
Mission—Department of Defense definition: The task, together with the purpose, that clearly
indicates the action to be taken and the reason therefore. In common usage, especially when
applied to lower military units, a duty assigned to an individual or unit, a task. For the purpose of
this instruction, a more detailed explanation of this term applies: A mission includes briefing,
controlling, and debriefing. Briefings should include training objectives. Controlling consists of
taking radio and radar control of aircraft, and accomplishing one or more types of mission, such
as air-to-air, air refueling, air-to-surface, and active air defense scrambles. Debriefing should be
with the pilots (and instructor where applicable). The brief and debrief may be accomplished via
telephone or radio; however, face-to-face briefs provide optimum training.
Master Question File (MQF)— A bank of questions whose development is provided or
overseen by a headquarters-designated OPR. Stan/Eval functions use the MQF in constructing
written examinations that this instruction requires.
Mission Qualification Training (MQT)—Specific training designed to prepare crew members
to perform duties/tasks in support of a unit mission or tasking. Graduates of MQT are certified
CMR/BMC by the squadron commander.
Non-Basic Mission Capable (N-BMC— (Noncurrent)—Individual is N-BMC upon loss of
currency, for example, did not meet lookback or annual training requirements, or fails initial
written examination during recurring evaluation.
 110                                                           AETCI13-101V2 27 MAY 2014


No-notice Evaluation—Give this evaluation at such time that preparation, beyond that which is
normally accomplished for the mission, is not possible. These evaluations may be complete
qualification evaluations, a written examination only, or a positional evaluation covering only
selected areas.
Positional Evaluation—This is the portion of a qualification evaluation that covers on-position
duties, actions, and responsibilities. This includes knowledge of console operations and unit
equipment capabilities and limitations.
Positional Training— Hands-on training resulting from performance of duties in assigned
positions.
Prorating—This is the process of determining the TRs proportionately. This process is used
when personnel are TDY, DNIF, DNIC, or on emergency leave for more than 30 days.
Qualification Evaluation—Conduct this written and (or) positional evaluation to check an
individual’s proficiency in performing operations duties or to let an examinee demonstrate to the
SEE the academic knowledge and ability to do assigned crewmember functions safely and
effectively. Types of qualification evaluations are INIT QUAL, recurring, RECHECK and
SPOT. Document qualification evaluations on AF Form 8.
Recurring Qualification Evaluation (QUAL)—This is an academic and positional evaluation
required for an individual to maintain BMC status.
RECHECK—This is a prior notice qualification evaluation given to an individual who has been
regressed to UQ status.
Re-examination—This is the re-accomplishment of a required written examination following a
failure.
Regression—This is the movement of an individual from BMC to N-BMC.
Remedial Training—Training for individuals who fail a SPOT or recurring evaluation, or do
not complete CT requirements. Once qualified, all personnel should meet all TRs, or otherwise
be downgraded from BMC status to UQ.
SPOT Evaluation—An evaluation normally outside the eligibility period to ensure correction of
identified discrepancies or to SPOT check an individual's proficiency. A SPOT evaluation is
normally limited in scope. It may be either a positional evaluation and (or) a written
examination. These evaluations may be either no-notice or with prior coordination. An
evaluation begun as a SPOT evaluation may become (and be documented as) a recurring
evaluation if all recurring evaluation requirements are completed during the SPOT evaluation.
Do not add on missions to complete the requirements for a periodic evaluation unless the group
or squadron commander concurs with the aircrew member’s desire to realign the evaluation
expiration date, and approves the additional flight time requirements. Note: When the flight
examiner administering a SPOT evaluation is not qualified in the MDS and crew position of the
examinee, the evaluation will not be credited toward a periodic evaluation.
Standardization/Evaluation Examiner (SEE)—A SEE is an operations crewmember who has
completed an objectivity evaluation, and is designated to perform evaluation duties as specified
by this instruction.
AETCI13-101V2 27 MAY 2014                                                                      111


Stan/Eval Objectivity Evaluation—A HHQ SEE or the OG chief of Stan/Eval (or his or her
designated representative) gives this evaluation to unit SEEs to determine their ability to perform
SEE duties. Document certification as a SEE on an AF Form 8, and designate the individual by
letter upon completion of this evaluation.
Stan/Eval Special Interest Item (SII)—This is an operational area of concern designated by
headquarters staff for evaluation during formal Stan/Eval visits.
Time Periods—The following definitions are provided for interpretation of timing requirements
specified in this instruction:
Training Period—A specific amount of time to accomplish a prescribed phase of training.
Unit Training Assembly (UTA)—For the purpose of this instruction, a UTA is considered to be
the 2-day period per month that ANG operations personnel spend on duty. The acronym UTA
equals one full ANG drill weekend. When computing due dates, the UTA weekend on which an
event initially takes place does not count. For example, a reference allows two UTAs for
completion of an event. The original decision or event occurs during the drill weekend in March.
The unit or individual would have until the end of the drill weekend in May to complete the
action or response. The use of weekday and evening training periods will not shorten this time
period.
Unit—For the purpose of this instruction, a unit is defined as a squadron required to establish its
own Stan/Eval program.
Unqualified— The status of an individual who: has not entered or completed IQT training
requirements and has not successfully passed an INIT QUAL for BMC status; or has twice failed
the academic portion of an evaluation; or has failed a recurring or SPOT positional evaluation or
has failed a reexamination; or has failed to meet TRs; or has been downgraded at the direction of
the commander or DO due to failure to complete a recurring qualification evaluation.
Weapons Director (WD)—Personnel with a duty AFSC 1C5X1D with duties involving control
of aircraft.
Weapons Technician (WT)—Personnel with a duty AFSC 1C5X1 with duties involving
assisting in the control of aircraft
