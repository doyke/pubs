SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Compliance items
and individual references have been updated to reflect policies, guidance and procedures
governing Logistics Maintenance Flight operations IAW new AFI 21-101 and CAF Supplement.
1. General.
    1.1. Compliance and Standardization Requirements Lists are the primary lists used during
    HQ ACC/IG Unit Compliance Inspections (UCI) to access unit compliance with guidance
    governing each particular area of operations. Items in this C&SRL are defined by the HQ
    ACC and, as applicable ANG and AFRC (for associate units only), staffs and based upon
    existing “by-law” requirements, Executive Orders, DoD directives, AF and ACC guidance,
    and mission areas deemed critical by AF, ACC and/or ANG leadership to assessing and
    assuring unit organizational health and/or performance. The objective of the C&SRL is to
    identify deficiencies that preclude attainment of required capabilities.
    1.2. Critical Compliance Objectives (CCOs) represent the highest priority of inspection
    items and are fundamentally derived from the Common Core Compliance Areas (CCCAs)
    and the missions areas defined in AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities. Lower tier Core
    and General Compliance Items may be stand-alone or subordinate to a CCO. During the
    UCI, it is the intent of the evaluation team to inspect, as a minimum, 100% of the CCOs that
    apply to the inspected unit. However, C&SRL items listed do not limit the scope of the
    inspection. Critical, core and general compliance criteria are defined as follows:
       1.2.1. Critical Compliance Objective (CCO). An area or item where unit failure to
       comply with established guidance could result in significant liabilities, loss of life or
       serious injury or significant mission impact. Key mission areas are:
       - Airman development programs
       - Ability to deploy forces
       - Ability to employ forces
       CCOs are shown in BOLD AND ALL CAPS FORMAT.
       1.2.2. Core Compliance Item (CCI). An item or area that requires special vigilance
       and is important to the overall performance of the unit, but are not deemed "Critical."
       Non-compliance would result in some negative impact on mission performance or could
       result in injury or possible litigations. CCIs are shown in ALL CAPS FORMAT.
       1.2.3. General Compliance Item (GCI). An item or area deemed fundamental to
       successful overall performance of the unit, but non-compliance would result in minimal
       impact on mission accomplishment or would be unlikely to result in injury or possible
       litigation. GCIs are shown in sentence case format.
