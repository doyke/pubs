                                                Chapter 1

                               PROGRAMMING AND BUDGETING

1.1. General. The unit commander designates the comptroller or Financial Analysis Officer position
non-critical sensitive according to AFPD 31-5, Personnel Security Program Policy, and AFI 31-501, Per-
sonnel Security Management Program. Access to programming information for planning and budgeting
requires a security clearance for access to classified material, up to and including secret.

1.2. Budget Preparation:
   1.2.1. Who Prepares Estimates. HQ AFRC/FMA develops command-wide estimates with specified
   Headquarters Air Force Reserve Command staff and unit participation. Unit Financial Analysis Offic-
   ers (FAO) task other organizations, Resource Advisors (RA), Responsibility Center Managers
   (RCM), Cost Center Managers (CCM), and personnel of geographically separated units (GSU) to pro-
   vide input. The annual "call" details requirements for specific Elements of Expense/Investment Codes
   (EEIC) for Operation and Maintenance (O&M) and project/subproject for Reserve Personnel Appro-
   priation (RPA).
   1.2.2. Annual "Call" for Financial Plan Estimates:
       1.2.2.1. HQ AFRC/FMA prescribes the formats that Headquarters Air Force Reserve Command
       staff agencies use to send in requirements.
       1.2.2.2. HQ AFRC/FMA sends "call" letters to each unit FM assigned an Operating Budget
       Account Number (OBAN). Upon receipt of the AFRC "call", unit FMs prepare and submit fiscal
       year estimates in the prescribed format for all supported units. The annual "call" spells out detailed
       mechanized and manual procedures.
   1.2.3. Review by Financial Review Committees. The unit financial committees critically review all
   budget and financial submissions. The responsible commander at each organization reviews and signs
   the cover letter attesting to unit review and approval before sending it to HQ AFRC/FMA. The com-
   manders ensure:
       1.2.3.1. Estimates conform to policies, guidelines, and programs approved for the unit.
       1.2.3.2. Estimates consist of valid pricing and quantitative computations.
       1.2.3.3. Submissions include factual and complete justifications.
       1.2.3.4. Submissions include all reimbursement programs.
   1.2.4. Forms to Use:
       1.2.4.1. The "call" letter identifies the forms the comptroller/FAO will use for O&M and RPA.
       1.2.4.2. Appropriation 3080: the comptroller/FAO submits the forms to HQ AFRC/FMAP as
       directed in the BPIE "call" letter.

1.3. Financial Plan Preparation. AFRC units submit a financial plan in the 3rd quarter of each fiscal year,
allowing better alignment of initial funds distribution with current requirements. HQ AFRC/FMA sends
specific instructions to FAOs.

1.4. Control of Appropriated Funds. To have good financial management and to avoid violation of
DFAS-DE 7200.1-R, Administrative Control of Appropriations, requires control over obligations Units
establish necessary management controls that ensure obligations do not exceed funding authority. All per-
sonnel who commit or obligate appropriated funds require knowledge of the contents of above regulation.
This requirement must be annotated in the personnel’s training record as part of resource management
system (RMS).
AFRCI65-601 2 MARCH 2004                                                                                  7


                                                Chapter 2

                          PARTICIPATORY FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

2.1. Financial Management. Even the best planning, programming, and budgeting efforts encounter revi-
sions/shortages of financial resources due to changing priorities, fluctuating economic conditions, and
other fact-of-life realities. Local authorities decide allocation of available resources to best accomplish,
direct, and support mission responsibilities. Resource allocation decisions to reduce, defer, or eliminate
programs and determine program priorities require the coordinated action and collective efforts of the
commander and supporting staff. Such participation enhances the quality of decision-making, and
improves resource programming and utilization. The financial committees (see Chapter 3) meet to dis-
tribute initial funding. However, the committees recognize that reprogramming authority does not mean
the unit automatically receives additional funds to cover the areas from which reprogramming occurred.

2.2. Levels of Management Participation. Each unit consists of two major levels of financial management
participation:
   2.2.1. Organizational Level. At this level each organizational activity determines its needs, competes
   for funding, and executes its share of operating resources. Organizational management develops and
   maintains efficient and effective internal management and control of all aspects of resource identifica-
   tion, allocation, and consumption.
   2.2.2. Unit/Base-wide Level. At this level each distinct organizational activity competes and cooper-
   ates with all other unit/base activities to accomplish the overall unit mission within available
   resources. An established process assists in obtaining commander approval of:
       2.2.2.1. Initial distribution.
       2.2.2.2. Prioritized unfunded requirements.
       2.2.2.3. Financial plans.
       2.2.2.4. Reprogramming between responsibility centers.

                          FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES

3.1. General. Commanders establish financial management committees for effective participatory finan-
cial management.
    3.1.1. Document, as a minimum, the following requirements.
       3.1.1.1. Role and responsibilities of the committees.
       3.1.1.2. Membership.
           3.1.1.2.1. All unit budget personnel will attend the Financial Working Group (FWG) and, or
           Financial Management Board (FMB). Attendance is for informational and advisory purposes.
       3.1.1.3. Frequency of meetings (time or event). See Attachment 1 for recommended timeframe.
    3.1.2. The objective of a financial committee is to give managers flexibility in determining how to
    apply organizational resources and to recognize the technical and support responsibilities of staff
    managers. The committee structure also encourages competition on the basis of individual program
    merit and degree of contribution toward mission objectives.

3.2. Financial Management Board (FMB). The host/tenant commander establishes the FMB in writing.
AFI 65-601, Volume II, Budget Management for Operations, defines responsibilities and membership
requirements. Prepare minutes for each meeting in the suggested format shown in Attachment 2 within
five workdays. Within 15 workdays after the FMB, forward a copy of the minutes to HQ AFRC/FMAP.
HQ AFRC/FM/IG personnel review file copies of minutes during staff assistance visits and inspections.

3.3. Financial Working Group (FWG). The commander establishes the FWG if the size of the organiza-
tion warrants different membership for the FMB and FWG. The Comptroller or Financial Analysis Officer
chairs the FWG, which consists of major RCMs, RAs, and technical advisors as locally determined by the
commander. Prepare minutes for each meeting according to the format in Attachment 2. The minutes
contain a summary of topics discussed, recommended actions, copies of applicable briefing charts, and
document any resource management training. The Financial Analysis office maintains the minutes and
makes them available for review.

3.4. Financial Advisement/Status of Funds. At least quarterly, FMA will brief the current status of funds
to all unit commanders during Unit Training Assembly (UTA).

    MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL OF FUNDS WITHIN THE AIR FORCE RESERVE
                         COMMAND (AFRC)

4.1. Operating Budget Account Number (OBAN). OBANs support all AFRC units.

4.2. AFRC O&M (Appropriation (Appn) 3740):
   4.2.1. Loading Targets. HQ AFRC/FMA issues Operating Budget Account Documents (OBAD) for
   both quarterly and annual obligation authorities to all OBANs. FAOs at field level distribute annual/
   quarterly obligation authority to the RC by EEIC by EOM of receipt of initial authority. Load targets
   below the RC level only if organizations below those levels exercise control of operating costs. Iden-
   tify costs to applicable Cost Centers (CC) (DFAS-DE 7000.1R, Responsibility Center/Cost Center
   Codes, as supplemented). When Financial Analysis Officers know of changes in authority, they notify
   their servicing accounting and finance offices, who include changes in end-of-month accounting
   reports. AFRC base Financial Analysis Officers input funds distribution via the remote on-line
   accounting tie-in to the DFAS Field Sites.
   4.2.2. General Funding Policy Guidance:
      4.2.2.1. Conference Management. Make all efforts to conserve travel funds to conduct meetings,
      conferences, workshops, etc, by holding them on military installations. Do not use non-contract
      commercial facilities for meetings, conferences, workshops, etc. Estimates exceeding $5,000 for
      total travel and per diem require approval for use of commercial facilities from the Numbered Air
      Force commander, or the ARPC commander for ARPC-sponsored conferences. HQ AFRC/ACV
      approves these requests for HQ sponsored meetings, conferences, and workshops.
      4.2.2.2. Vehicle Rental (Part-Time). OBAN 95 (HQ AFRC) budgets and funds for vehicle rental
      to support AFRC/IG visits that exceed unit in-house motor pool capabilities.
      4.2.2.3. Funding of Civilian Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Moves:
          4.2.2.3.1. The gaining unit funds normal civilian PCS moves within AFRC. The unit issuing
          the PCS order obtains the necessary accounting classification from the financial management
          office of the gaining AFRC unit.
          4.2.2.3.2. The losing unit funds PCS moves generated by DOD actions (such as base closures,
          reductions-in-force (RIF), or conversions). Use standard RC/CC XX8101 and prime mission
          program element code (PEC).
          4.2.2.3.3. PCS moves are funded “after-the-fact”. Funding will be distributed to the units the
          month following the obligation. To qualify for this funding, your obligation must be at least
          $5,000.00. Any obligation less than $5,000.00 will remain unfunded until your PCS cumula-
          tive total reaches the $5,000.00 threshold. You may submit a written request for funding to
          cover obligations under this threshold if required.
      4.2.2.4. Wage Grade (WG) Pay Increases. FAOs submit to HQ AFRC/FMAO a copy of new WG
      pay schedules approved and established for unit WG civilian personnel when received.
      4.2.2.5. Facility Projects. HQ AFRC/CE controls the actual funds and sends a message to the base
      civil engineer authorizing solicitation of bids for approved projects. When the civil engineer pro-
10                                                                      AFRCI65-601 2 MARCH 2004


     cesses the AF Form 9, Request for Purchase, the funds reservation message is attached and routed
     through FM for coordination and forwarded to contracting. Upon receipt of offers, the low accept-
     able offer is identified. When the price is determined fair and reasonable (and within HQ AFRC/
     CE approval authority), HQ AFRC/FM issues the annual and quarterly funds to the applicable unit
     based on a HQ AFRC/CE/FM joint message. The AF Form 9 is returned to the local FM for place-
     ment of the funds citation and certification/obligation of funds.
     4.2.2.6. Modified Commitment Accounting. Due to the lead-time associated with preliminary
     contracting actions, originators often send AF Forms 9 (or similar type request for purchase),
     through their support accounting office before the quarter in which they incur obligations. This
     practice ties up needed quarterly authority unless you advise the financial services office (FSO) on
     the document that funds are not available for obligation until a subsequent fiscal period. To avoid
     tying up quarterly authority unnecessarily, the applicable funds manager indicates on the PR when
     to expect obligation action (for example, the contract award date, etc). The FSO then makes a
     "qualified funds certification," placing a statement similar to the following on the document:
     "I certify availability of funds effective (first day of the appropriate quarter) unless I advise you to
     the contrary before that date." (Reference DFAS-DER 7000-5, Accounting for Commitments)
     Under this procedure, funds are not committed until the quarter specified in the qualified state-
     ment. Financial Analysis Officers instruct resource managers in this procedure and work closely
     with the support FSO to monitor commitments on a continuing basis.
     4.2.2.7. Intercommand Deployments, Including Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) Exercises. AFI
     65-601, Volume I, Chapter 10, Operation and Maintenance, Air Force, Appropriation, instructs
     how to fund costs associated with these activities whenever you have transfer of operational con-
     trol (aircraft and personnel). The use of AFRC-assigned Emergency and Special Program (ESP)
     codes is mandatory.
     4.2.2.8. Support Agreements. Support agreements between the supplier (or host) and the receiver
     (or tenant) identify and delineate support responsibilities. Units generate the agreements and the
     local plans office functions as the office of primary responsibility.
         4.2.2.8.1. Units use DD Form 1144, Support Agreement, to document support given/received
         from other Air Force organizations, other military services, or Federal agencies. (See AFI
         25-201, Chapter 1, Support Agreement Procedures, for exceptions.) DD Form 1144 also
         includes cost estimates for each mandatory and optional category of support. The supplying
         financial analysis office (FMA) reviews the agreement and generates these cost estimates,
         including an economic analysis, if necessary, using methodology provided by the Secretary of
         the Air Force/Financial Management, through HQ AFRC/FMA. The supplying FMA also
         documents the costs and includes this information with the support agreement package. Iden-
         tify current reimbursable support using guidance in AFI 65-601, Volume I, Chapter 7 and AFI
         25-201, Chapter 4.
         4.2.2.8.2. After ensuring the accuracy of all specifics in the agreement, the unit comptroller or
         Financial Analysis Officer signs the agreement in the "Comptroller Signature" block, under
         the "Supplying Component" or the "Receiving Component," as applicable. After signature, the
         plans office submits the agreement to HQ AFRC/LGX which forwards it to other functional
         areas for review and approval.
AFRCI65-601 2 MARCH 2004                                                                            11


        4.2.2.8.3. Unit Financial Analysis personnel perform an annual budget review of all the sup-
        port agreements and update the cost estimates as necessary. (See AFI 25-201, Chapters 2 and
        5)
     4.2.2.9. Support Furnished Incident to Aircraft Accident Investigation Operations. AFRC units
     provide in-house emergency and logistical assistance to the investigating team as required by AFI
     91-204, Investigating and Reporting US Air Force Mishaps, and AFPD 32-40, Disaster Prepared-
     ness. This support does not include TDY costs of investigating board members of other major
     commands. The investigating command pays related costs for lease of vehicles, contractual ser-
     vices, and communication. (Reference AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Chapter 7)
     4.2.2.10. Equipment Leases (AFRC Units). All proposed new equipment leases undergo an
     appropriate Economic Analysis (EA) (see AFMAN 65-506, Economic Analysis) which substanti-
     ates the lease as the lowest total overall cost (LTOC) alternative. Comptroller/Financial Analysis
     Office staff performs EAs and forwards the analyses to HQ AFRC/FMAP for review/approval.
     Also, refer to AFI 65-601, Volume I, Chapter 10, for lease with option to purchase information. In
     either case, the Comptroller/Financial Analysis Officer ensures that the analysis considers appro-
     priation impacts in both O&M (Appn 3740) and BPIE (Appn 3080). NOTE: Forward a copy of the
     EA for equipment determined uneconomical to lease to HQ AFRC/XPR for consideration of fund-
     ing from fund code YR (Reserve Equipment Appropriation 0350).
     4.2.2.11. Subsidiary Limitations. HQ AFRC establishes three-digit alphanumeric codes that allow
     tracking of legal and administrative limitations. The "Footnote Narrative" portion of O&M
     OBADs issued to all OBANs includes these codes.
     4.2.2.12. Reimbursements. Review of the status of earned versus anticipated appropriation reim-
     bursements is a critical budget responsibility. When financial analysis offices observe reimburse-
     ments not earning at the rates anticipated, they investigate the causes and take immediate
     corrective action. Review the Operating Budget Ledger (OBL) regularly. Reimbursement author-
     ity will be automatically apportioned to the extent that reimbursable orders are received and
     accepted.
     4.2.2.13. Environmental Programs:
        4.2.2.13.1. Environmental Compliance (PEC 55356F). The environmental compliance pro-
        gram includes all work necessary to ensure Air Force activities comply with applicable fed-
        eral, state, interstate, and local environmental regulations and standards as well as DOD and
        Air Force environmental policies. This program accounts for costs of annual "must do" ser-
        vices and projects associated with "keeping the gates open" (or recurring requirements) such
        as hazardous waste disposal, permit fees, sampling, analysis, monitoring, etc, as well as non-
        recurring compliance requirements. Prior to FY95 this PEC included all other environmental
        services not covered above except Defense Environmental Restoration Account (DERA)
        projects. In FY95, however, costs associated with pollution prevention and environmental
        conservation were segregated from the environmental compliance PEC as follows:
        4.2.2.13.2. Environmental Conservation (PEC 55953F). Use PEC 55953F for environmental
        education/training, including the DOD Cultural and Natural Resources Management Course;
        environmental certifications/licenses only if part of a mandatory training course; Environmen-
        tal Impact Analysis Process (EIAP) (applicable law is the National Environmental Policy Act
        (NEPA); Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUS) study preparation and updates in sup-
12                                                                  AFRCI65-601 2 MARCH 2004


        port of EIAP noise analysis; natural resources; annual reviews and updates of environmental
        plans; cultural resources; and natural resources management.
        4.2.2.13.3. Pollution Prevention (PEC 55954F). The pollution prevention program includes
        all work necessary to eliminate or reduce undesirable impacts on human health and the envi-
        ronment. This program includes municipal solid waste (MSW) reduction; ozone depleting
        chemicals (ODC) elimination; hazardous waste reduction; toxic release inventory (TRI)
        reduction; hazardous material use reduction; and air emission reductions. Typical costs funded
        under this program include: travel, training, maintenance of foundations, projects or equip-
        ment that eliminate or reduce use of ODCs (such as recycling equipment, storage cylinders,
        antifreeze recyclers, paper and cardboard balers, composting equipment and hazardous mate-
        rial pharmacy requirements, etc), opportunity assessments and management action plans.
     4.2.2.14. Cost Per Flying Hour (CPFH):
        4.2.2.14.1. Units receive funds for stock funded CPFH Budget Code 8 and Budget Code 9
        items, i.e., depot level reparables (DLRs) and consumable flying hour supplies. Users establish
        due-outs for CPFH assets from supply that obligate customer O&M funds. Examples of users
        are: aircraft maintenance, communications, civil engineering, vehicle maintenance, medical,
        etc. Pay particular attention to any DLR or CPFH requirement covered in support agreements.
        4.2.2.14.2. The funding document that issues annual O&M funds contains administrative sub-
        sidiary limitations. Load funding targets to the using RC/CC by EEIC consumption (644--fly-
        ing; 60902--flying hour consumables). Financial analysis offices track program execution
        closely and work with HQ AFRC/FMAO to prevent violations.
        4.2.2.14.3. Reprogramming into the CPFH EEICs from other O&M EEICs is permitted.
        Reprogramming out of CPFH EEICs into other O&M programs is not permitted.
        4.2.2.14.4. Non-flying DLRs, EEIC 645, will be funded on initial funding document based on
        unit requests and known requirements from HQ AFRC/LGQP.
        4.2.2.14.5. Successful execution of this program requires communication and close coordina-
        tion between the RAs, the cost per flying hour (CPFH) program manager, and the financial
        analysis office. Reparables severely impact quarterly O&M authority. RAs, the CPFH pro-
        gram manager, and the financial analysis office closely monitor obligations/due-outs through
        reports provided by the base supply system and the general accounting and finance systems.
        Report discrepancies immediately to your support unit LG/CPFH program manager for
        research and/or correction.
        4.2.2.14.6. Prior to FY closeout, financial analysis offices establish Miscellaneous Obligation
        Reimbursable Documents (MORD) against estimated stock fund price increases by EEIC for
        all due-outs. This requires close review of CPFH due-outs, estimated delivery dates, and pos-
        sible cancellations. Unit Responsibility Center Managers (RCM) and the CPFH program man-
        ager must work closely with the financial analysis office during this time.
     4.2.2.15. AFRC Fund Cites. Transferring your fund cite to another AFRC unit, or to the headquar-
     ters, is not authorized without a waiver approved by HQ AFRC/FM. Requests for waivers must be
     in writing, signed by the unit commander or HQ AFRC directorate, as applicable, and forwarded
     to HQ AFRC/FMAP, through the local Financial Management office.
AFRCI65-601 2 MARCH 2004                                                                              13


      4.2.2.16. Wellness Programs. Appropriated funds may be authorized to pay the costs incurred by
      employees participating in agency authorized smoking cessation programs along with other pro-
      grams classified as “preventive” activities per the U.S. Office of Personnel (OPM) Federal Person-
      nel Manual (FPM). Other associated costs, such as nicotine patches used in a smoking cessation
      program, are not authorized.
      4.2.2.17. Promotional Items and Awards. Although appropriated funds may be used to procure
      nominal value promotional items and awards for the Quality Air Force program, units must be
      prudent in using the limited resources available and make only reasonable, low cost ($25.00 or
      less) purchases of promotional items (coffee mugs, pens, note pads, etc).
      4.2.2.18. Shipment of Transferred Vehicles. The losing unit will fund (if requested to do so by the
      host) shipment of an AFRC-owned vehicle identified for transfer from one AFRC location to
      another AFRC location.
      4.2.2.19. Coins and Medallions. There is no authority which allows the use of appropriated funds
      to procure mementos simply for being assigned to an organization. Such a coin or medallion could
      be procured with appropriated funds when used as an award as outlined in AFI 65-601, Vol I, para-
      graphs 4.29 through 4.30.2, but not as standard issue for being present for duty. The Wing Com-
      mander must appoint an OPR to keep an inventory of the coins. The OPR will maintain a record to
      show the following: date of issue, recipient of coin, reason, and a continuous inventory of the
      coins.
      4.2.2.20. Active Guard Reserve (AGR) Travel. Use O&M funds for travel and per diem related to
      AGR personnel after reporting to duty station. Unit O&M funds are used and will not have a sub-
      sidiary limitation. Reserve Personnel Appropriation is responsible for PCS and transportation
      funds associated with the initial accession and separation costs of AGR personnel assigned to
      AFRC units, issued in Project 731. The gaining unit will use their own funds and will receive addi-
      tional authority for these costs from HQ AFRC/FMAR. Funds will be fenced and can only be used
      to fund the PCS and transportation costs for AGRs.
      4.2.2.21. Performance Awards. When an employee transfers from one AFRC unit to another
      AFRC unit, the gaining base will fund the performance award for that individual.

4.3. Air Force O&M (Appn 3400) Funds Used by AFRC:
   4.3.1. Contingency Official Representation Funds (ORF). HQ AFRC/FMAP, in conjunction with HQ
   AFRC/PA, monitors and controls contingency funds. Address all requests for ORFs to HQ AFRC/PA.
   4.3.2. Environmental Restoration Account (ERA). Charge ERA costs, subject to subsidiary limita-
   tion, to PEC 78008. The base civil engineer provides budget requirements and monitors funds. ERA
   normally funds the feasibility study used to choose a remediation option.
      4.3.2.1. If long term monitoring is the selected course of action, funding for the first two years
      comes from Air Force O&M (Appropriation 3400). After two years, Appropriation 3740 (AFR
      O&M) becomes the funding source.
      4.3.2.2. If chosen, remedial action funding continues in AF Appropriation 3400 for ten years,
      before transferring to AFRC Appropriation 3740 for the remaining life of the action.
14                                                                      AFRCI65-601 2 MARCH 2004


4.4. AMC MPA Travel/Per Diem and OCONUS Commercial Transportation. HQ AMC provides
funding for the programs outlined in 4.4.1. and 4.4.2. HQ AFRC “unit equipped” organizations qualify for
this funding for both programs as outlined below. Associate units only qualify for funding in support of
the OCONUS Commercial Transportation Program as outlined in 4.4.2. Funding for travel and per diem
associated with AMC MPA travel and per diem for associate units will be provided by the parent wing
fund cite. Specific procedural and coding guidance will be provided via Procedural Information Message
(PIM) traffic. (Reference AMCI 65-601)
     4.4.1. MPA Travel and Per Diem. Unit equipped organizations receive funding from HQ AFRC/FMA
     in OAC 65 to cover travel and per diem expenses for AMC-directed MPA missions, associate units
     receive fund cites from parent wing. Travel orders are prepared using the appropriate AMC fund cite.
     Tasking messages must accompany all travel orders prior to issuance to ensure proper coding.
     4.4.2. OCONUS Commercial Transportation. All units receive funding from HQ AFRC/FMA in
     OAC 65 for OCONUS commercial transportation for Aerial Port Squadrons and Maintenance Squad-
     rons en route support, along with TACC-tasked support from Aerospace Medical Evacuation Squad-
     rons. Only the over-water transportation costs are funded by OAC 65. (When using city pair, the entire
     transportation cost is considered as OCONUS and charged to OAC 65.) All other costs associated
     with OCONUS en-route support is funded by RPA. Dual fund cites must be used on the same set of
     orders (OAC 65 for OCONUS transportation and RPA-721.XX for CONUS transportation costs and
     per diem when applicable). Unit organizations will receive Deployment Review Board (DRB)
     approval letter and initiate travel order using funds provided in OAC 65. Unit organizations must pro-
     vide a copy of the DRB approval letter to unit FM.

4.5. Reserve Personnel Appropriation (RPA) (Appn 3700):
     4.5.1. Loading Targets:
        4.5.1.1. HQ AFRC/FMA issues decentralized (TBAS) funding for travel, per diem, transportation
        costs, clothing and subsistence, for both annual and quarterly authority, to all OBANs. Financial
        Analysis Officers distribute annual/quarterly obligation authority to organizations by project/sub-
        project. Load organization targets into the support FSO allotment ledger at the responsibility cen-
        ter level.
        4.5.1.2. Subsidiary Limitations. HQ AFRC establishes three digit alphanumeric codes that allow
        tracking of legal and administrative limitations. The "Footnote Narrative" portion of the RPA
        OBADs issued to all OBANs includes these codes.
        4.5.1.3. HQ AFRC/FMA issues Personnel Budgeting and Analysis System (PBAS) annual and
        quarterly authority by OBAN. These funds are loaded in PBAS as targets and a like amount is
        loaded in the accounting system at Denver to cover the obligations recorded in PBAS. The pay
        and allowance portion of RPA is a specific allotment. Exceeding targets in PBAS can lead to an
        anti-deficiency act violation.
     4.5.2. General Funding Policy Guidance:
        4.5.2.1. Both PBAS and decentralized RPA funds are segregated into budget activity codes
        (BAC). BAC 1 funds for pay and allowances (P&A), clothing, subsistence, gratuities, travel,
        transportation, per diem, and related expenses for personnel performing unit training assembly
        (UTA), annual tour (AT), additional flying training periods (AFTP), initial active duty training
        (IADT), and readiness management periods (RMPs). BAC 2 pays for all costs associated with
AFRCI65-601 2 MARCH 2004                                                                             15


     Reserve personnel performing tours of active duty for training (school) and additional training
     (special) tours. BAC 2 also pays for costs associated with Reserve personnel who suffer injury or
     contract disease in line of duty while participating in active or inactive duty training, Air Force
     Reserve Enlisted Incentives Program Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) Basic, MGIB Kicker, Medical
     Bonuses including Loan Repayment Program (LRP) and Special Pay Incentives (SPI), and Tuition
     Assistance. NOTE: See guidance for using accounting processing codes (APC) on Reserve orders
     in Attachment 8.
     4.5.2.2. Commercial transportation/travel funds in support of DRB-approved deployments are
     issued at the project 721/727 level with a corresponding administrative limitation as prescribed by
     paragraph 5.2. The subsidiary limitation, which appears on your funding document, is CO1 for
     project 721 and CO7 for project 727. Record the targets and subsequent obligations at the required
     five-digit project/subproject level.
     4.5.2.3. RPA funds Special Assignment Airlift Mission (SAAM) approved deployments (Appro-
     priation 3700). Funds are issued at the project 721/727 level with a corresponding administrative
     limitation as prescribed by paragraph 5.2. The subsidiary limitation, which appears on your fund-
     ing document, is SO1 for project 721 and SO7 for project 727. Record the targets and subsequent

     4.5.2.4. RPA funds are authorized for organizational clothing, as defined in AFI 65-601, Volume
     1, Chapter 10. Use project/subproject 721.19 for unit assigned officer/enlisted and 722.19 for IMA
     officer/enlisted members. Project/subproject 721.09 and 722.09 will be cited for enlisted initial
     issue and replacement clothing for unit personnel and IMA members respectively.
     4.5.2.5. Reserve Member Grade Insignia/Accouterments. Installations may purchase enlisted
     grade insignia and accouterments for free issue. Treat these insignia as a normal supply type
     expense. Allowance Standard (AS) 016 does not allow officer insignia and/or accouterments to be
     purchased with appropriated funds.
        4.5.2.5.1. Installations will use RPA funds to sew insignia and accouterments on enlisted
        member’s uniforms when enlisted member’s replace these items or receive a promotion.

        bursements should be posted to the same budget activity that is used to direct cite dining facility
        operating expenses.
        4.5.2.9. Variable Tour on AF Form 938, Request and Authorization for Active Duty Training/
        Active Duty Tour. Commanders and orders approving authorities will coordinate all variable tour
        extensions with the financial management office. The FM office will ensure funds availability and
        obligate funds into the PBAS to cover the extended period of the tour. This action is needed to
        ensure that pay and allowance funds are not over obligated. The statement “The unit FM office has
        coordinated on this authorization and required funds are obligated” must be included with the duty
        certification statement.
        4.5.2.10. AFRC Fund Cites. Transferring your fund cite to another AFRC unit, or the headquar-
        ters, is not authorized without a waiver approved by HQ AFRC/FM. Requests for waivers must be
        in writing, signed by the unit commander or HQ AFRC directorate, as applicable, and forwarded
        to HQ AFRC/FMAP, through the local financial management office.

4.6. Other Procurement (Appn 3080):
     4.6.1. Loading Targets. The FSO of the computer support base (CSB) according to DFAS-DE
     7010.1-R, General Accounting and Finance Systems at Base Level, paragraph 14-13, receives funds
     to finance procurement of non-medical investment equipment (FC 17, Appropriation 3080) for AFRC
     bases. The applicable AFRC Financial Analysis office receives the automated document and provides
     a copy of the documents to the CSB FSO accounts control function. All Appropriation 3080, Fund
     Code 17 documents have the CSBs accounting and disbursing station number (ADSN). Take the fol-
     lowing actions to ensure that funds are properly loaded (by CSB accounts control) in the accounting
     system. Selected supporting FSOs receive medical equipment (3080) funds.
     4.6.2. General Funding Policy Guidance:
        4.6.2.1. Units receive Appropriation 3080 (BPAC 84XXXX) funds to finance the annual require-
        ments for base level procurement of authorized investment equipment items (Budget Code Z
        items with a system unit cost of $250,000 or more). These funds are available for obligation for
AFRCI65-601 2 MARCH 2004                                                                               17


      three fiscal years; however, use these funds to finance the program requirements of the appropria-
      tion year and treat funds as annual programs. Maintain close coordination with local LG and HQ
      AFRC/LG personnel.
      4.6.2.2. The FSO receiving the funds monitors and controls the automated system for these trans-
      actions; however, AFRC Financial Analysis Officers monitor the status of these funds. The finan-
      cial analysis office formally requests (see Section 75 of DFAS-DE 70-77.2-M, USAF Standard
      Base Level General Accounting and Finance System) a copy of the Status of Funds Data Base
      Transmission (DBT) Report (RCS:HAF-ACF(AR)7801) from the FSO at the computer support
      base. Request the M07 report from the supply system through normal distribution. If these
      monthly reports do not reflect the same status, correct any discrepancies.

4.7. AFRC Major Construction Program (MCP) (Appn 3730):
   4.7.1. Loading Targets. HQ AFRC/FMA issues annual budget authority to AFRC units by project,
   FY, and Budget Authorization Account Number (BAAN). Budget Officers/Financial Managers load
   the authority into the support FSO Allotment Ledger. No quarterly authority is issued.
   4.7.2. General Funding Policy Guidance:
      4.7.2.1. AFRC Military Construction Program (MCP) includes budget projects: P313 -- Planning
      and Design (for both P321 and P341); P321 -- line item approved major construction (projects in
      excess of $1,500,000); and P341 -- unspecified minor construction (projects in excess of
      $500,000).
      4.7.2.2. Reprogramming is not authorized between budget projects or MCP projects. The Finan-
      cial Analysis Officer monitors all military construction projects by assigned civil engineer work
      project number. Upon completion of each project, the Financial Analysis Officer notifies HQ
      AFRC/CEM of excess funds available for withdrawal.

4.8. Reserve Equipment (Appropriation 0350, Fund Code YR):
   4.8.1. Loading Targets. Organizations with approved requirements receive these funds. HQ AFRC/
   FMAP issues funding documents to the applicable OBAN, where the funds are loaded into the support
   FSO Allotment Ledger.
   4.8.2. General Funding Policy Guidance:
      4.8.2.1. Congress allocates the Reserve Equipment Appropriation (0350) to purchase items
      needed to maintain Reserve readiness for mobilization. The funds are available for three years, for
      example, FY98 expires 30 Sep 00; FY99 expires 30 Sep 01; etc.
      4.8.2.2. Use these three-year funds, as soon as possible after receipt of funding authority to place
      items on order.

4.9. Reprogramming Guidance:
   4.9.1. O&M (Appn 3740). Reprogram as authorized between EEICs and PECs except as stated
   below:
      4.9.1.1. Commanders do not reprogram annual authority between budget activity codes (BAC)
      since legal limitations apply. AFI 65-601, Volume II, Chapter 4, paragraph 4.1.2.1 states: "You can
18                                                                      AFRCI65-601 2 MARCH 2004


        reprogram quarterly authority between BAs during the first three quarters of the FY as long as you
        don't exceed the annual authority by BA. During the 4th quarter, you may not exceed the total
        funding in each BA (it must equal the amount shown on the funding document received from
        higher headquarters)."
        4.9.1.2. Commanders do not reprogram from facility projects (EEIC 52X) and architectural and
        engineering (A&E) services (EEIC 532). HQ AFRC withdraws funding identified for canceled
        contracts or contracts that contain excess funding when the contract is awarded for less than pro-
        grammed. The wing commander may reprogram “unit controlled funds” for approved facility
        projects. Each occurrence must be reported through the base CE to HQ AFRC/CE, with the unit
        FM supplying an info copy to the applicable HQ AFRC/FM O&M analyst..
        4.9.1.3. Commanders do not reprogram between program elements of co-located but separately
        commanded units without formal documented consent of both commanders.
        4.9.1.4. Commanders do not reprogram Depot Level Reparable (DLR) funding (EEIC 645) or
        CPFH funding (EEICs 60902 and 644).
        4.9.1.5. Commanders do not reprogram civilian pay funding (EEICs 39X).
     4.9.2. RPA (Appn 3700). Reprogram between project/subprojects except:
        4.9.2.1. Commanders do not reprogram annual authority between BAs since legal limitations
        apply. Otherwise, reprogram between projects/ subprojects within BA unless restricted by senior
        leadership.
        4.9.2.2. AFI 65-601, Volume II, Chapter 4, paragraph 4.1.2.1 applies to this appropriation also. It
        states "You can reprogram quarterly authority between BAs during the first three quarters of the
        FY as long as you don't exceed the annual authority by BA. During the 4th quarter, you may not
        exceed the total funding in each BA (it must equal the amount shown on the funding document
        received from higher headquarters)."

4.10. Unfunded Requirements (UFR). HQ AFRC/FMA accepts valid UFRs from units any time
throughout the fiscal year. UFRs are normally not acted upon until midyear but if justification warrants
out-of-cycle funding, the UFR is presented to the command section via a Staff Summary Sheet (SSS).
Each AFRC unit forwards a copy of their UFR request to the applicable NAF/FM for validation.

4.11. Miscellaneous Obligation Reimbursable Documents (MORD). F i n a n c i a l a n a l y s i s o ff i c e s
closely monitor the issuance of MORDs for recurring and one-time requirements (for example, communi-
cations services, utility services, unprocessed AFTPs, etc). Issue MORDs for all known service type
requirements to reflect a realistic and timely monthly obligation status. Also, periodically review esti-
mates for excessive variances between estimated and actual obligations.
     4.11.1. Ensure an estimated obligation is accurately maintained for inactive duty training in PBAS. At
     the time of the PBAS end of month general ledger transmission, the PBAS IDT MORDs must be suf-
     ficient to reserve funds for all IDT periods which have been performed and not yet paid, and all IDT
     periods which will be performed during the following month.
        4.11.1.1. The IDT MORDs for the end of month August general ledger transmission must be suf-
        ficient to cover all unpaid IDT periods which have been or will be performed during the FY. Close
AFRCI65-601 2 MARCH 2004                                                                                 19


       coordination is required with all units to ensure no unusually high participation is scheduled for
       September, which is not covered in the August MORD.
       4.11.1.2. The PBAS General Ledger for each FY is maintained for 15 months. This means that for
       the first three months of each FY, the PBAS system is also maintained and updated for the previ-
       ous FY. For the end of months October, November, and December, general ledger transmissions
       for the current and the previous FY are required. For the end of month December general ledger
       transmission for the previous FY, the IDT MORDs should be reduced to zero unless sufficient
       documentation is on hand to identify specific individuals who have performed IDT periods during
       the previous fiscal year and have not been paid. This expired FY general ledger is recorded as the
       end of year PBAS position for that FY. Units should be prepared to explain any unpaid balances in
       this final expired FY transmission.

4.12. MIPRs and Project Orders:
   4.12.1. Funds on the MIPR that are expiring and have not been obligated by the performing agency
   must be returned to the requiring agency.
   4.12.2. Project Orders, which are issued to separately manage and finance Government Owned and
   Government Operated (GOGO) establishments, are not subject to the Economy Act. Funds need not
   be returned to the requiring activity when the funds expire regardless of the status of the work speci-
   fied on the project order.

4.13. Fiscal Year (FY) Closeout Checklist. AFRC publishes detailed and specific supplemental close-
out procedures as required. The closeout checklist actions shown below require all commanders to ensure
effective use of funds and accurate and valid recorded obligations. It is possible that completing checklist
actions makes additional funding available and avoids cancellation of obligations after the close of the
FY. Fiscal yearend closeout actions require the personal involvement of each unit Commander, Responsi-
bility Center Managers, Resource Advisors, and the financial committee. Supplement the checklist below
with local procedures as necessary to ensure effective use of funds. Notify HQ AFRC/FMA of any funds
available for withdrawal. The DOD Appropriations Act provides that you do not obligate more than 20
percent of current FY funding during the last two months of the FY (see AFI 65-601, Volume I, Chapter
4, paragraph 4-2). This necessitates careful planning to ensure obligation of at least 80 percent of your
available funds by 31 July. This limitation precludes unnecessary and, or wasteful practices near the end
of the FY. Comptroller, supply, and procurement personnel work closely with their Commander and unit
Resource Advisors to ensure compliance with this limitation. NOTE: Limitation applies to all projects
available to AFRC except obligations for support of active duty training of Reserve components, Reserve
Officer Training Corps (ROTC), and health professional scholarship program.
   4.13.1. Actions by the Commander:
       4.13.1.1. Appoint in writing by 1 July each year the Comptroller or Financial Analysis Officer as
       project officer to monitor and control the yearend review as prescribed in this Chapter.
       4.13.1.2. Vest in this officer the authority to require responsible persons to adhere to scheduled
       duties as outlined in succeeding paragraphs.
       4.13.1.3. Convene and preside over unit financial committee meetings.
       4.13.1.4. Require from the project officer, before 15 July, a schedule for implementing closeout
       actions and a list of all unfunded requirements.
20                                                                       AFRCI65-601 2 MARCH 2004


        4.13.1.5. Require the project officer to attend all meetings held with operating officials where
        they discuss funding and, or make determinations that affect fourth quarter funding and obliga-
        tions.
        4.13.1.6. For AFRC units not authorized a full-time logistics management officer, designate some
        other staff officer to perform necessary logistics management actions.
     4.13.2. Actions by the Comptroller/Financial Analysis Officer:
        4.13.2.1. Keep close liaison with the FSO/DAO, DFAS Field Site representative, functional staff
        officers, resource advisors, and funds managers to accomplish required FY-end adjustments.
        4.13.2.2. Analyze all accounts on a daily basis during September to ensure input of required
        adjustments.
        4.13.2.3. Actively participate in the review of recorded obligations. Help the FSO/DAO deter-
        mine the validity of obligation data; for example, civilian pay accruals in the Status of Funds Data
        Base Transmission Report (RCS: HAF-ACF(AR)7801) and Civilian Manpower Funding Report
        submitted under RCS: DD-COMP(AR)1092, DOD Budget Guidance Manual Reports.
        4.13.2.4. Ensure validity and accuracy of all unliquidated obligations, particularly those sup-
        ported by MORDs. As early as possible in September:
            4.13.2.4.1. Adjust any unsupported amounts to preclude post-closure fallout.
            4.13.2.4.2. Carefully review obligations for TDY travel (both O&M and RPA) and civilian
            PCS moves. With coordination of your support FSO, establish procedures for identifying and
            obligating end-of-fiscal year TDY requirements.
        4.13.2.5. Maintain a list of unfunded requirements by priority. Consider formal procurement
        lead-time for O&M funds and availability of personnel for RPA funds.
        4.13.2.6. Issue supplemental closeout instructions during June each fiscal year. RCS:
        DD-COMP(AR)1092 applies.
        4.13.2.7. Validate remaining balances on all funding documents issued for International Merchant
        Purchase Authorization Card (IMPAC) by 25 Sep of each year. No later than 26 Sep of each fiscal
        year, the paying office will start recording Sep calls against the funding document balances. (Full
        procedures are provided in the AFI 64-117, Air Force Government-Wide Purchase Card (GPC)
        Program, 6 Dec 02.
     4.13.3. Actions by the Supply Manager. Resource advisors and cost center managers require manage-
     ment reports produced by the standard base supply system. These reports depict supply transactions
     and management indicators that affect materiel and financial resources. RAs/CCMs review these
     reports in a timely manner and advise the Financial Analysis Officer of any discrepancies. Daily con-
     tact between the Financial Analysis Officer and supply officer during closeout ensures obligation of
     available funds for critical requirements.
     4.13.4. Actions by the Person Responsible for Contract Lodging. On 1 September, review contract
     lodging requirements for the remainder of the fiscal year. Ensure that your estimates include support
     of September UTAs and any programmed annual training that extends into September. Adjust AF
     Form 4009 (Government Purchase Card Fund Cite) to ensure that funds are obligated to cover end-of-
     year expenses.
AFRCI65-601 2 MARCH 2004                                                                               21


4.14. AFRC Base Level Financial Management Responsibilities. The AFRC base-level financial
management office is responsible for all normal host financial management duties and responsibilities for
all OBANs (OAC 62) assigned at their location, to include NAF OBANs.

4.15. Reserve Member Lodging. The following provides the correct appropriation to use for lodging
associated with reserve tours. These rules apply to all reserve tour lodging, whether centrally billed or
billed to the individual reservist. The term “government” for lodging purposes refers to “on installation”
or “government contract quarters”. Dual status tours may require use of both RPA and O&M appropria-
tions.
   4.15.1. Reserve Personnel Appropriation (RPA) (Appn 3700):
       4.15.1.1. Annual Tours – Government or Non-Government lodging (regardless of meal availabil-
       ity).
       4.15.1.2. School Tours – Government or Non-Government lodging.
       4.15.1.3. Special Tour – Government or Non-Government lodging.
       4.15.1.4. Inactive Duty (away from unit of assignment/attachment) – Government or Non-Gov-
       ernment lodging.
   4.15.2. Operation and Maintenance (O&M) (3740):
       4.15.2.1. Inactive Duty (at unit of assignment/attachment)--Government lodging.
   4.15.3. Payment/reimbursement is not authorized when a member is performing IDT at unit of
   assignment/attachment and utilizes commercial quarters (non-government).

                           FUNDS DISTRIBUTION AND ADJUSTMENTS

5.1. Issuance of AFRC Funds:
     5.1.1. The AFRC Chief of Financial Analysis (FMA) and the Chief of Procedures and Funds Control
     Branch (FMAP) sign AFRC funding documents. These persons and, or HQ AFRC/FMA financial
     analysts provide emergency telephone authorization and confirming message notification concerning
     AFRC funding documents.
     5.1.2. HQ AFRC/FMA issues interim message authority to the field units for funding documents not
     mailed by the 20th of the month. The Financial Analysis Officer at tenant locations provides a copy of
     the interim message to their support FSO and, or DFAS Field Site.
     5.1.3. Use telephone notification for approval and issuance of AFRC funds only in an extreme emer-
     gency and to prevent over-obligation or critical mission stoppage. HQ AFRC/FMA analysts follow up
     telephone issuance or adjustment of funds by E-mail message confirmation within 24 hours. The
     recipients take follow-up action if they do not receive written authorization within a reasonable time.
     The appropriate funding document follows telephone notification.
     5.1.4. The unit follows up the emergency request for funds after the 20th of the month with written
     justification explaining what caused the requirement. This applies to all years, all appropriations,
     quarterly and annual funding.
     5.1.5. HQ AFRC/FMA Analysts and Comptroller/Financial Analysis Officers of AFRC units use
     AFRC Form 41, Telephone Log--Funding Requirements, to document emergency telephone requests
     and, or record adjustments of funding. Record on this form the name of requesting individual, date
     and time of call, nature of emergency, applicable document data, amount of funding needed to avoid
     mission degradation reimbursement authority, etc. Include the nature of the emergency in a memoran-
     dum for record on each confirming message.
     5.1.6. Normally funding adjustments are in response to units quarterly obligation authority requests—
     DD-COMP(AR)1092 report (see paragraph 5.3.). Annual unfunded requirements are funded as
     resources become available and are prioritized by the command FMB.

5.2. Authority of the Funding Document. A funding document is the authority to incur direct and reim-
bursable obligations. AFRC uses automated funding documents. Documents contain information related
to limitations, ceilings, targets, fences, and other funding guidance. HQ AFRC/FMA issues all quarterly
authority on the initial document. During execution, HQ AFRC/FMA adjusts current quarter obligation
authorities, based on quarterly DD-COMP(AR)1092 reports (paragraph 5.3.) submitted by each AFRC
unit financial analysis office; plus, adjusts annual programs as required.
     5.2.1. Operating Budget Appropriations. Documents reflect applicable quarterly phasing except for
     the fourth quarter. Effective 1 July each year, fourth quarter equals annual amounts for fund codes
     (FC) 30, 50, 54, and 83.
     5.2.2. Non-operating Budget Appropriations. Budget authorization/allotment documents for all other
     fund codes show annual authority only for FCs YR, 17, 57, and 89.
AFRCI65-601 2 MARCH 2004                                                                                23


5.3. Report--Quarterly Obligation Authority Requirements. AFRC units assigned OBANs submit
their updated cumulative quarterly obligation authority requirements by E-mail message for all operating
budget appropriations to reach HQ AFRC/FMA applicable division not later than the 5th workday of the
third month for the first three fiscal quarters. Closeout procedures designate procedures to follow for the
fourth quarter. Quarterly requirements for the new fiscal year are due by 31 August. Estimate quarterly
projections on end-of-year position. DD-COMP(AR)1092 applies. State amounts to the nearest thousand
dollars.
   5.3.1. Follow sample messages at Attachment 3 for the quarterly reports referenced above to reflect
   BAs for O&M appropriations; projects for military family housing; and projects with budget activity
   for RPA. Show direct and reimbursements separately.
   5.3.2. Include detailed data in minutes of the financial committee meeting held to validate quarterly
   funding requirements. If there is not a financial committee meeting, include detailed data in a memo
   for record (MFR) of the briefing provided to the commander.

                                                 Chapter 6

                                     OTHER FUNDING POLICIES

6.1. Counterdrug Support Operations. For all requirements involving counterdrug support operations,
commanders providing counterdrug support (to include subordinate units), flying operations and financial
analysis personnel coordinate closely to ensure:
     6.1.1. All RPA special tour orders (funded in BAC 2, P727) include a training category code (TCC)
     of "QB," or “QC” for pay and allowances identification through the Joint Uniform Military Pay Sys-
     tem--Reserve Forces (JUMPS-RF) system.
     6.1.2. Establishment of separate organization cost center records in the supply system (if volume war-
     rants it).
     6.1.3. Ensure that all O&M counterdrug support has the proper counterdrug PEC assigned to it.

6.2. Funding of Miscellaneous Non-flying Units:
     6.2.1. AFRC retains authority to approve or disapprove funding for miscellaneous non-flying units.
     The OBAD of the nearest AFRC flying unit or the OBAD of the unit providing JUMPS-RF support
     normally includes funding. Financial Analysis Officers who provide funding support to more than one
     unit within the same PEC, with the participation and coordination of respective commanders, makes
     an equitable distribution of funds among units. Flying unit Financial Analysis Officers provide normal
     support and guidance on budgetary and fiscal matters. They do not approve/disapprove funding for
     amounts specifically identified to miscellaneous non-flying units. Their responsibility includes refer-
     ring requests for funds in excess of the approved financial plan for a particular unit or program ele-
     ment to HQ AFRC. They also assist miscellaneous non-flying units in preparing funding requests.
     6.2.2. In addition to the above general guidance, the following non-flying units have unique funding
     requirements:
        6.2.2.1. NAFs rely on the Financial Analysis Officer of the nearest flying unit. However, HQ
        AFRC/FMA through a financial management staff specialist located at each of the regional sup-
        port groups administers financial policy affecting all NAF headquarters.
        6.2.2.2. AFRC provides total fund support for AMC and ACC-gained Aero-medical Staging
        Squadrons (ASTS). ASTS commanders input their fund requirements to the designated AFRC
        unit financial plan. The designated AFRC unit funds all required support.
        6.2.2.3. The same OBAN that funds for the non-flying units provides funding for costs of travel
        performed by Air Force Reserve active duty personnel (951 RSPTS), with duty as advisors to
        AFRC miscellaneous non-flying units. Charge costs to the PEC appropriate to the non-flying
        Reserve unit he or she advises.
        6.2.2.4. AFRC distributes funds for recruiting costs under PECs 58160 and 58168. AFRCR 45-1,
        Recruiting Resource Management, contains funding policy for recruiting activities which unit
        Financial Analysis Officers support. NOTE: Recruiting does not have a personnel accounting
        symbol code, therefore, recruiting RAs identify their RPA requirements to their servicing financial
        analysis office concurrent with their O&M funds requirements.
AFRCI65-601 2 MARCH 2004                                                                               25


           6.2.2.4.1. Charge RPA funds for initial accession and separation travel for unit personnel in
           support of recruiting. Use P727XX travel funds for recruiting/retention support, including
           extended tours qualifying for PCS moves. Charge O&M funds for further TDY travel of
           recruiters after reporting to the recruiting location for duty.
           6.2.2.4.2. Charge travel for applicants for enlistment to the recruiting PEC 58160 citing EEIC
           409.
           6.2.2.4.3. HQ AFRC pays for recruiting advertising, printing, and promotional items under
           PEC 58168F.

6.3. Emergency and Special Program (ESP) Codes. SAF/FMB and HQ AFRC assign ESP codes to
identify costs associated with AFRC participation in specific programs. Place ESP codes in all fund cites
on applicable obligating documents. RCS: SAF-ACF(AR)7801 subsequently reports expenses for each
ESP code.

6.4. Program Element Code (PEC) Usage During Mission Conversion. AFRC units incur costs to
convert to new weapon systems (program elements), pre-conversion costs (school TDY, repair parts/
bench stock buildup, etc) several months before the official conversion date. If the expenses occur during
the same fiscal year as the official conversion date, record them in the gaining PEC. If they occur before
the fiscal year of conversion, record the costs in the losing mission program element (weapon system). In
either case, establish a separate RC/CC to segregate conversion costs per DFAS-DE 7000.1-R/AFRC Sup
1. To assure correct PEC, coordinate with HQ AFRC/FMAP.

6.5. Depot Maintenance Business Area (DMBA): BAC 01 provides depot purchased equipment main-
tenance (DPEM) funds from which AFRC reimburses the DMBA for depot level maintenance. Depot
level maintenance includes a large variety of maintenance, overhaul, reclamation, manufacture, assembly
and disassembly, etc., for aircraft, aircraft equipment and accessories, electronic and communications
equipment, vehicles, and other equipment. It also includes government furnished materials procured from
supply management business area (SMBA) stock funds by the DMBA and consumed by the depots in
support of the Air Force Reserve.

6.6. Accuracy and Timeliness of Reporting:
   6.6.1. Every management process contains continuous analysis of reports. Establish local procedures
   to ensure validity of coding on reports within coding criteria delineated by higher headquarters. The
   command computer records and makes available for extract reported data. Use extracted data in bud-
   get formulation and execution to respond to inquiries, to develop special cost studies, and to perform
   comparative analyses.
   6.6.2. In addition, Financial Analysis Officers place special emphasis on meeting suspense dates
   established on communications from outside the unit. The Financial Analysis Officer notifies the
   requester and gives the reason for slipped suspense dates and date of anticipated reply.

6.7. Reference Materials. Publications listed in Attachment 4 provide information/guidance frequently
needed. The financial analysis office (or place nearby) keeps publications needed/used most frequently.

6.8. Self-Inspection. Each unit develops a self-inspection program. Attachment 5 is a checklist devel-
oped for AFRC inspection teams. Ensure your self-inspection efforts incorporate at least the criteria con-
tained in Attachment 5.
AFRCI65-601 2 MARCH 2004                                                                               27


                                                 Chapter 7

              APPROPRIATED FUND (APF) SUPPORT OF MORALE, WELFARE,
                    RECREATION, AND SERVICES (SV) ACTIVITIES

7.1. General. SV activity categories assist the field in identifying and tracking support provided by APF.
This chapter reflects definitions of the three categories and of direct and indirect costs.

7.2. Categories of SV Activities:
   7.2.1. Category A, Mission Sustaining. Provide the most essential activities in all but the most exten-
   uating combat conditions. Since they have the least capacity to generate revenue, the Air Force-estab-
   lished goal for APF support of Category A SV activities is 100 percent funding. Category A activities
   are:
       7.2.1.1. Armed Forces Professional Entertainment Program Overseas.
       7.2.1.2. Common support services.
       7.2.1.3. Gymnasium/physical fitness/aquatic training/aerobic studios.
       7.2.1.4. Libraries.
       7.2.1.5. Parks and picnic areas.
       7.2.1.6. Recreation centers/rooms.
       7.2.1.7. Isolated/deployed/free admission motion pictures.
       7.2.1.8. Sports/athletics (self-directed, unit level, intramural).
       7.2.1.9. Unit level programs and activities.
   7.2.2. Category B, Basic Community Support Activities. These activities closely relate to Category A
   and are essentially community support systems with little ability to generate revenue. Category B
   activities receive substantial support from APF. Air Force established goal for APF support of Cate-
   gory B SV activities is 50 percent. Category B activities are:
       7.2.2.1. Arts and crafts skill development.
       7.2.2.2. Automotive crafts skill development.
       7.2.2.3. Child development centers.
       7.2.2.4. Entertainment (music and theater).
       7.2.2.5. Outdoor recreation.
       7.2.2.6. Recreational swimming pools.
       7.2.2.7. Sports program (above the intramural level).
       7.2.2.8. Youth activities.
       7.2.2.9. Stars and Stripes.
       7.2.2.10. Bowling centers (12 lanes or less).
       7.2.2.11. Marinas without resale or private boat berthing.
28                                                                          AFRCI65-601 2 MARCH 2004


        7.2.2.12. Recreational information, tickets, and tour service.
     7.2.3. Category C, Revenue-Generating Activities. These activities have the highest capacity to gen-
     erate revenue and are self-sustaining businesses capable of funding most expenses. The Category C
     activities are the least essential to the military mission but provide recreational activities necessary for
     a well-rounded recreation program. They receive no direct APF support but are authorized limited
     indirect APF support. Category C activities are:
        7.2.3.1. Clubs.
        7.2.3.2. Aero clubs.
        7.2.3.3. Amusement machine locations and centers.
        7.2.3.4. Animal care funds.
        7.2.3.5. Armed services exchange and related activities.
        7.2.3.6. Armed forces recreation centers (accommodation/dining and resale facilities).
        7.2.3.7. Audio/photo and other resale activities.
        7.2.3.8. Bingo.
        7.2.3.9. Bowling centers (over 12 lanes).
        7.2.3.10. Cabins/cottages/cabanas/recreation recreational guest houses and famcamps.
        7.2.3.11. Catering.
        7.2.3.12. Civilian dining, vending, and other resale activities and services.
        7.2.3.13. Joint service facilities.
        7.2.3.14. Other areas included are: golf courses, marinas and boating activities with resale or pri-
        vate boat berthing, paid admission movies, rod and gun clubs, package stores, skeet/trap ranges,
        snack bars/soda fountains, stables, unofficial commercial travel services, motorcycle clubs, para-
        chute/sky diving clubs, skating rinks, and supplemental mission funds such as in-flight services,
        etc.

7.3. Direct Costs. Direct costs are directly related to, or caused by, the operation of SV activities. Exam-
ples of direct cost elements are: civilian personnel costs when 25 percent or more of the individual's
assigned duties support SV; civilian PCS travel; TDY travel; utilities; rents; contracted or in-house equip-
ment maintenance; minor construction; aircraft petroleum, oil, and lubricants; other supplies.

7.4. Indirect Costs. Indirect costs are marginal costs for goods or services in support of the SV that result
from broad military mission requirements that do not exist specifically to support SV. Examples are: com-
munications-electronics; printing and reproduction; civil engineering maintenance and repair; legal ser-
vices; contracting; fire protection; security police; pest control; snow removal; refuse collection and
collection services; contracting; medical and veterinary; transportation/vehicles; architectural and engi-
neering (A&E); Office of Special Investigations (OSI); and data automation (information processing cen-
ters).

                                                Chapter 8

                   ORGANIZATIONAL LEVEL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

8.1. General. The resource management system involves all levels of management. Responsibility Cen-
ter Managers, resource advisors, and cost center managers act as focal points for organizational resource
management.

8.2. Responsibility Center (RC) Management. Responsibility Centers are the focal point for manage-
rial control of subordinate RCs and, or cost centers and function as a reporting level for financial account-
ing. Each unit commander determines the unit RC structure ensuring that responsibility for resource
management is clearly assigned within all subordinate organizations. Subordinate RC functions are the
same as an RC but on a smaller scale. Subordinate RCs report to major RCs.
   8.2.1. Major RCs generally report directly to the commander and represent such activities as mainte-
   nance, operations, logistics, support, etc. Commanders designate major RCs as financial committee
   members.
   8.2.2. HQ AFRC/FMAPP establishes subordinate RCs to fix program responsibilities and manage
   budget development and execution. The CPFH program manager is an example of a “fixed program.”
   Each Mission Design Series (MDS) has a fixed set of RC/CCs to capture obligations/expenditures
   pertinent to the unit’s flying hour program. No exception, no deviations without approval of HQ
   AFRC/FMAP. DFAS-DE 7000.1-R is the governing regulation when establishing CPFH RC/CCs.
   8.2.3. Each Responsibility Center Manager (RCM) formally appoints resource advisors (RA) by let-
   ter with an information copy to the supporting FMA.
   8.2.4. All unit activities fall within an organizational structure of RCs and are designated by local
   directive. The local directive, if desired, includes descriptions of the RC organization using tools such
   as organizational charts.
   8.2.5. AFI 65-601, Volume II, is an excellent tool for all comptrollers and Financial Analysis Offic-
   ers. Especially helpful is Chapter 10 on the resource management system, which defines responsibili-
   ties at each level (comptrollers, commanders, resource managers, resource advisors, etc). In addition,
   it provides valuable information on administering and distributing the budget, establishing and main-
   taining targets, and reprogramming authority.

                                                Chapter 9

                                               TRAINING

9.1. Financial Management Training Program:
     9.1.1. Responsibilities:
        9.1.1.1. HQ AFRC Chief of Financial Analysis:
            9.1.1.1.1. Provides necessary guidance to assist base/unit level training programs.
            9.1.1.1.2. Serves as focal point to disseminate information involving the resource manage-
            ment system (RMS) within the command.
            9.1.1.1.3. Monitors the quality of base/unit level RMS training.
            9.1.1.1.4. Provides initial, specialized, and refresher RMS training for all assigned HQ AFRC
            financial managers.
        9.1.1.2. AFRC base and tenant Financial Analysis Officers develop a unit training program to
        provide initial, specialized, and refresher training for financial committee members, RC managers,
        and resource advisors. The RCM or RA provides initial and refresher training for the CC manag-
        ers. At AFRC bases the chief of supply provides initial and refresher training in the proper use of
        management products produced by the supply system computer. At tenant locations the host sup-
        port base supply is responsible for this training.
     9.1.2. Categories of Training:
        9.1.2.1. Initial Training. New RC and CC managers require initial RMS training within 90 days of
        assignment of financial management responsibilities. Initial training for resource advisors starts
        within 30 days after assignment and ends within 90 days. This training:
            9.1.2.1.1. Provides trainees with a basic understanding of the types of resources to manage
            and the tools available to use. Don't overwhelm them with details.
            9.1.2.1.2. Acquaints trainees with the financial management structure of the installation and
            the directives and guides (local and higher headquarters) with which they need to be familiar.
        9.1.2.2. Specialized Training. This training assists RCMs and RAs in dealing with the financial
        management problems of their particular organization. This training is necessary since programs
        managed by every RC are not the same. While some RCs have only supply/equipment require-
        ments, others have more complicated and perhaps unique programs. NOTE: Unit training pro-
        grams make allowances for specialized training.
        9.1.2.3. Refresher Training. Examples of refresher training include items of current interest such
        as preparation of operating budget, RCM/RA responsibilities, policy changes from AFRC con-
        cerning fund administration, and yearend closeout procedures.
     9.1.3. Training Methods. Financial Analysis Officers determine the best methods to train individuals.
     Effective training includes either one or all of the following methods:
        9.1.3.1. Financial Committee Presentations. This method suits presenting changes in policies and
        procedures, and providing instructions on budget preparations and other forms of refresher train-
        ing. However, it does not particularly suit either initial or specialized training.
AFRCI65-601 2 MARCH 2004                                                                                  31


       9.1.3.2. Seminar/Group Presentations. Depending on the size and composition of seminar/group,
       this method suits initial, specialized, or refresher training. Ensure the structure of the group is
       compatible with the type of presentation (for example, do not invite long-time unit RAs to an ini-
       tial training session).
       9.1.3.3. Individual (Face-to-Face) Presentations. Perhaps this method best suits initial and spe-
       cialized training. Frequently, this type training is conducted without a conscious realization that it
       is training. It is specialized training when financial analysis personnel assist in resolving problems
       during the course of daily dealings with RCMs/RAs.
   9.1.4. Training Aids/Guides. Obtain financial management training guide from HQ AFRC/FMAPP.
   When using training aids/guides, measure their effectiveness. Written tests and critiques provide a
   valuable source of feedback on understanding of information contained in the training material. The
   financial management training program contains, as a minimum, time-phased refresher training ses-
   sions to ensure complete annual reviews of these training aids/guides.
   9.1.5. Documentation of Training:
       9.1.5.1. The Financial Analysis Officer keeps records on training provided to each financial man-
       ager. These records show the date of assignment to funds management responsibilities and each
       training date. The RCM or RA who provides the training keeps records of refresher/follow-on
       training of unit level CC managers.
       9.1.5.2. At AFRC bases, the supply officer maintains records pertaining to supply funds manage-
       ment training.
       9.1.5.3. At non-AFRC bases, the Financial Analysis Officer maintains records pertaining to sup-
       ply funds management training.
       9.1.5.4. The AFRC base and tenant Financial Analysis Officer briefs the financial committee
       quarterly on status of RMS training provided to unit financial managers and documents the train-
       ing in the committee minutes.
       9.1.5.5. Clearly distinguish RCM and RA financial management training program from any for-
       mal on the job training (OJT) and Air Force specialty code (AFSC) qualification training pro-
       grams for reservists and assigned active duty personnel. The RCM and RA financial management
       training program supplements, but does not substitute for, the AFSC qualification training pro-
       gram.

9.2. Reservist Qualification Training Program. As AFRC comptroller representative, the unit comp-
troller is responsible for all support and general management guidance of the qualification training for all
unit assigned reservists with comptroller AFSCs. AFI 36-2202/AFRC Supplement 1, Developing, Man-
aging, and Conducting Training, contains detailed responsibilities for this training program.

                                                 Chapter 10

                           UPWARD OBLIGATION ADJUSTMENTS (UOA)

10.1. General. Public Law 101-510, FY 1991 National Defense Authorization Act, 5 Nov 90, restruc-
tured the life cycle of appropriations and required the development of new management procedures to
process UOAs to expired and canceled year appropriations. SAF/FMB established policies for processing
and reporting UOAs in compliance with PL 101-510 and DOD guidance. An appropriation expires when
its specific time limit (i.e., one year or multi-year) runs out. The expired period extends for five years after
the original time limit ends. After the five years, the appropriation becomes canceled or closed. Once an
appropriation expires, its funds are no longer available for new obligations. However, there are legal
UOAs that can occur using the original “pot” of money. UOAs are defined as an increase in obligations to
an expired or canceled year appropriation. The distinction is important in relation to funding UOAs.
Expired appropriations are available for adjustments and disbursements. UOAs relating to an expired
appropriation must maintain the fiscal year identity of the expired appropriation. Canceled appropriations
are not available for obligation adjustments or to liquidate recorded obligations not yet disbursed. UOAs
to canceled appropriations must be obligated against current available appropriations. Since zero or
no-year appropriations never expire, they may be cited until the funds are exhausted.

10.2. Within-Scope Contract Change Approvals. Under Public Law 101-5-1, within-scope contract
changes must be approved by the Comptroller of the Department of Defense USD(C) if:
     10.2.1. Change requires additional work by the contractor.
     10.2.2. Change will be financed with prior year funds.
     10.2.3. The funds required for the program, project or activity (PPA) exceed $4 million during a fiscal
     year.
     10.2.4. This category may include but is not limited to the following:
        10.2.4.1. Differing Site Conditions.
        10.2.4.2. Re-procurements Caused by Contract Defaults.
        10.2.4.3. Engineering Change Proposals (ECP).
        10.2.4.4. Value Engineering Change Proposals (VECP).
        10.2.4.5. Contract Change Proposal.

10.3. Within-Scope Contract Change Thresholds. Within-scope contract changes must use the same
fiscal year funds as the related obligation. SAF/FM has granted approval authority to the major com-
mands of $100K for this type of adjustment. HQ USAF/REC has a $4 million threshold for these type
items. Once reached, request for approval must then be forwarded through HQ USAF/REC for USD(C)
approval.

10.4. Locally Approved. The following UOA categories require no additional work by the vendor and
may be approved locally, if under $25,000:
     10.4.1. Award Fees.
AFRCI65-601 2 MARCH 2004                                                                               33


   10.4.2. Incentive Fees.
   10.4.3. Administrative Errors.
   10.4.4. Accounting Errors.
   10.4.5. Price Inflation (wage determination, escalation price, and cost sharing adjustments).
   10.4.6. Ratification Actions.
   10.4.7. Foreign Currency Fluctuations.

           PRIORITIES FOR OBLIGATION OF RPA FUNDS (SCHOOL TRAINING)

A7.1. If limited funds prevent formal training, it is necessary to prioritize training requirements. A listing
of courses is not possible since units have different needs. Each unit compiles its own list, determining
essential versus nonessential training needs. To align requirements with available funds review this list
frequently. Courses that do not award an AFSC have a low priority. To help in establishing school request
priorities, unit commanders should form a school committee to review and prioritize known training
requirements. The order of priority, along with some areas considered in establishing these priorities, are
furnished below. (NOTE: The budget officer should contact HQ AFRC/FMAR before canceling formal
training courses due to lack of funds.)
   A7.1.1. Initial skill acquisition courses at Air Education and Training Command resident schools.
   A7.1.2. Skill-qualifying flying and flying related courses that are considered essential.
   A7.1.3. Mandatory seven-level and officer AFSC awarding courses.
   A7.1.4. Gaining MAJCOM required field training detachment courses.
   A7.1.5. Essential courses affecting unit's C status.
   A7.1.6. Officer/airmen professional military education (PME).
   A7.1.7. Five- and seven-level advanced/lateral/supplemental courses.
   A7.1.8. Courses that do not award an AFSC or lead to skill upgrading.

          PROCEDURES FOR USING THE ACCOUNTING PROCESSING CODE (APC)

A8.1. APC Codes. The APC is a six position code required for all pay inputs in JUMPS-RF procedures.
It identifies the work center, the training center, and the accounting code. The breakdown is:
     A8.1.1. The two-digit alpha-numeric code for the work center identifies the type of unit (aerial port,
     civil engineering, etc) and relates directly to the eight-digit personnel accounting symbol code of
     member assignment.
     A8.1.2. The one-digit numeric code for the training center is a 0 (zero) unless the work center man-
     ager wishes to identify expenses below the work center level. It relates directly to the work center. An
     example of a training center code use is to specifically identify an equipment maintenance branch or a
     component repair branch under a maintenance squadron.
     A8.1.3. The three-digit accounting code identifies the exact fund cite to be charged for pay and allow-
     ances (P&A). This accounting code always relates specifically to a project/subproject and, or pay sta-
     tus.

NOTES:
     1. Includes short military education courses (that is, Reserve Components National Security
        Course, NCO Leadership Development Training, Harvard Senior Executive courses, BOLD
        STROKE, flag/general officer courses, etc) and continuing education courses for professional
        AFSCs (medical, legal and chaplain, engineer, acquisition, etc)
        2. Use this TCC instead of BZ and EZ for any unit undergoing mission/aircraft conversion.
        3. Participants not in direct support of the military competitions are not eligible for appropriated
           sponsorship; they must participate on invitational orders.
        4. Year of training policy changes no longer permit award of initial skill AFSC after home sta-
           tion training, therefore OJT no longer qualifies for school tour credit. All hands-on skill train-
           ing at the unit will be in special tour status in this TCC. Normally, tours for OJT are restricted
           to upgrade milestone requirements when the member has difficulty achieving the next skill
           level with scheduled IDTs and AT over the mandatory upgrade period. OJT is limited to 45
           cumulative days per upgrade event without a waiver.
        5. This TCC covers all flying and nonflying training to qualify for the duty position or UTC that
           cannot be satisfied during scheduled IDTs and AT. Is typically training of a recurring nature,
           not related to AFSC upgrade.
        6. Use this TCC instead of MZ or RZ until the unit completes conversion.
        7. This TCC is used only when IMAs or unit members are being employed in support of a task-
           ing to AFRC from the JTF. When the JTF tasks non-AFRC units, and Reserve augmentation is
           needed (whether IMA or unit assigned members), military personnel appropriation mandays
           must be used.
        8. Use this TCC for both IMAs and unit-assigned members regardless of drug mission origin
           (that is, active mission or reserve mission as assigned by the JTF). The 45-day limit applies.
        9. Used when aircrew and related support staff have no other upgrade or mission qualification
           milestones to meet under Operational Training (MZ). Not authorized for IMAs.

A8.5. To Recap:
     A8.5.1. An APC OF A10E22 tells the P&A system that the member is assigned to an aerial port
     squadron (APS), that the member is enlisted, and that he or she is performing refresher and profi-
     ciency training (726.03).
     A8.5.2. If the servicing pay office services more than one colocated APS, the other APS work center
     code would be A2; a third APS would be A3.

  A8.5.3. If the APC is E60101, the member is an officer, assigned to a civil engineering squadron/
  flight, and is performing an annual tour.
