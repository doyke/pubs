6. Issue Procedures for Custody or Consumption of Munitions.
   6.1. There are two types of issues authorized for munitions items: consumption issues and
   custody issues. All issue requests will be submitted by electronic means. Utilize the FV2520
   CoP (https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/ClosedCoP.asp?Filter=OO-LG-SP-17) to the
 6                                                            45SWI21-201 20 DECEMBER 2011


     fullest extent possible. If you cannot get access to the CoP, your issue request can be
     submitted on a locally generated issue template.
        6.1.1. Consumption Issues. Consumption issues are limited to those assets consumed or
        installed within 15 days. Consumption issues may vary from that quantity which must be
        consumed on the day of issue to that quantity which will be consumed within 15 calendar
        days from the date and time of issue. If available storage facilities cannot satisfy the
        security and safety requirements, the consumption issues are restricted to that quantity
        which can be consumed on the day of issue. See AFI 21-201, paragraph 7.13.2.1.
        6.1.2. Custody Issues. A custody issue is an issue to an individual or organization for
        use at a point in time that may exceed 15 days. Secure facilities and adequate storage
        must be available for support of all custody issues. All custody issues are controlled on a
        custody account. See
AFI 21-201, paragraph 7.13.2.2.
     6.2. Requests for issue will be accomplished by submitting an electronic Issue Request via
     the FV2520 CoP. All requests will be reviewed by PLSSC munitions personnel and
     approved or disapproved for processing. Any issues submitted that exceed approved
     allocation quantities will be disapproved. If additional allocations are required, the unit will
     submit an Out-Of-Cycle Request in accordance with AFI 21-201.
        6.2.1. Issue requests for assets required for Flightline Sortie Generation will be requested
        on a quarterly basis. Custodians will send requirements via email to the PLSSC
        Munitions Section NLT the 15th day of the month prior to each new quarter. PLSSC
        munitions personnel will verify the requirements against current authorizations. All
        requests that exceed allocations will be rejected.
     6.3. Munitions items will not be issued until all documentation has been properly processed
     and qualified munitions inspectors have performed required inspections.
     6.4. Using munitions for purposes other than those for which the munitions were originally
     issued may constitute a violation under the Air Force Fraud, Waste, and Abuse Program. If
     exercises, training, or competitive events are cancelled, or a unit is not selected to take part in
     these events, then the original munitions authorization is void and the organization must turn
     in the unused munitions. Munitions are only authorized for use by the owning
     organization/shop identified on the AF Form 68 and are not authorized for release/use to
     other organizations/shops within the unit or to other external units.
     6.5. Munitions issued to organizations must be retained in the original packing except for
     assets in use. When munitions assets are in use, the organizations must still retain the
     original packing.
     6.6. When custody account issues are not processed for the total allocation, a due-out will be
     linked to the issue document number in the Combat Ammunition System (CAS) system for
     the remaining quantity until the allocation is filled. Due-outs not filled will be canceled in
     the CAS system by the end of FY.
7. Issue of Munitions Required for Aircraft Time Change.
     7.1. Forecasting of CAD/PAD items shall be accomplished in accordance with AFI 21-101.
     When units must forecast for CAD/PAD requirements not visible to the ALC in the
45SWI21-201 20 DECEMBER 2011                                                                  7


   Requirement Determination Module (RDM) of REMIS, use the AFTO Form 223, Time
   Change Requirements Forecast, (automated or manual) in accordance with Technical Order
   (T.O.) 00-20-9, Forecasting Replacement Requirements for Selected Calendar and Hourly
   Time Change Items.
   7.2. Munitions organizations will meet quarterly with Maintenance Operations Flight (MOF)
   P&S and the Flight Service Center (FSC) to determine requirements for the next 6-month
   period.
   7.3. All issues of time change items, regardless of expendability, recoverability, or
   reparability code (ERRC), will be issued under the due-in from maintenance (DIFM) control
   concept. The DIFM control concept means that when an asset is issued, it is tracked until it
   is turned in. The only exception to this procedure would be an inadvertent firing of
   munitions where there is nothing left to turn in except an empty casing. In this instance, an
   initial issue will be processed.
   7.4. Submit the issue request using the electronic Issue Request Form located on the FV2520
   CoP. Include the aircraft tail number and the ground date in the request.
   7.5. Munitions Operations will maintain close coordination with the requesting activity to
   ensure the issue document is not processed until 72 hours prior to the actual required date.
   7.6. A copy will be filed in the account folder on the share drive (FV2520 CoP).
8. Munitions Custody Account Expenditure (Nonsortie-Generated) Procedures.
   8.1. Requests for expenditures from FV2520 Custody Accounts will be accomplished by
   submitting an electronic Expenditure Request via the FV2520 CoP. If you cannot get access
   to the CoP, your expenditure request can be submitted on a locally-generated expenditure
   template.
   8.2. Request will be reviewed by PLSSC munitions personnel, validated, and processed. A
   copy of the processed expenditure document will be returned via email. A copy will be filed
   in the account folder on the FV2520 CoP.
   8.3. Expenditure request must be electronically submitted within 5 workdays after
   expenditure or installation.
9. Munitions Custody Account Expenditure (Sortie-Generated) Procedures.
   9.1. Utilize direct input methods to the fullest extent possible when completing sortie-
   generated expenditures.
   9.2. It is the responsibility of flight-line expediters to relay expenditure information as
   quickly as possible to PLSSC munitions personnel. Account custodians will use radio,
   telephone, fax, e-mail, or runner to relay the information as soon as actions are completed.
   9.3. Expenditures will not be processed in CAS until a validated AF Form 2434 or local
   equivalent is obtained from account custodians.
10. Procedures for Turn in of Munitions.
   10.1. Units will request turn-in actions of munitions by preparing an electronic Turn-In
   Request via the FV2520 CoP at least 5 workdays prior to the requested turn-in date.
 8                                                          45SWI21-201 20 DECEMBER 2011


        10.1.1. DIFM assets will be returned within 15 days after issue. The 15-day count starts
        from the date assets were physically issued.
     10.2. The using organization will ensure munitions are returned, except for assets in use.
     Returning munitions will be in their original container and packaging. All munitions will be
     segregated and identified by lot number.
     10.3. The PLSSC Munitions Inspector will perform a physical count of all munitions and the
     content of the containers, except for those still factory-sealed and intact. If the physical
     count differs from the quantity entered on the electronic turn-in document, the Munitions
     Inspector will coordinate with the responsible individual, resolve the discrepancy, correct the
     turn-in document, and return the electronic form via e-mail. A copy will be filed in the
     account folder on the share drive FV2520 CoP.
     10.4. Intransit found-on-base (FOB) munitions will be placarded ―Hold for FOB‖ and stored

      14.1.10. Commanders will perform an annual review and renewal of this agreement.
15. Munitions Inventory Procedures.
   15.1. All munitions supply points will be inventoried once every 3 months. An individual
   from PLSSC munitions will assist with the inventory and provide over-the-shoulder
   guidance. Two weeks prior to each of these scheduled inventories, organizations will be
   notified of the inventory start date. Custodians are asked to review their account to ensure all
   assets are on hand and stored in their proper location. Any movements, expenditures, or
   issue requests must be submitted and completed by the inventory start date. Only emergency
   requirements will be issued during the inventory. Refer to AFI 21-201 for the types and
   frequency of inventories.
   15.2. Inventories will be performed using electronic CAS-generated inventory worksheets
   (AM427) and direct input methods to the fullest extent possible. The account will be frozen
   before the physical count. Inventories will be conducted during the appropriate inventory
   month and reconciled within 30 days of inventory start date. Exception: Complete all
   semiannual inventory processes and post all necessary records by the last day of the
   scheduled inventory month.
      15.2.1. Custody Account Inventories. PLSSC munitions personnel will electronically
      forward a CAS-generated AM427G Inventory Count Listing to account custodians. The
      custodian will have 14 calendar days to return the completed inventory listing to
      munitions for processing in CAS. If discrepancies were discovered during processing, a
      recount of the affected item will take place. When all inventory discrepancies have
      cleared, munitions personnel will ―unfreeze‖ the inventory in CAS and generate an
      AM507A, Custody Account Listing, for signature by the custodian and unit commander.
      Additionally, an inventory results letter will be generated listing all discrepancies
      discovered during the inventory. These discrepancies must be corrected and verified

   PLSSC contractor munitions personnel and the 45 SW MASO or designated representative.
   During monthly 10% inventories, the inventory team will consist of a minimum of two
   individuals (at least one will be a contractor munitions person), with all findings forwarded to
   the MASO.
45SWI21-201 20 DECEMBER 2011                                                                   11


   15.4. Reconciliation and recount procedures. If discrepancies exist after the first count,
   conduct a recount, to include a check of the following areas (Note: Inventory recounts will
   be conducted by an alternate team, if available):
      15.4.1. The inspection/maintenance bay.
      15.4.2. The transportation holding area (if applicable).
      15.4.3. The unserviceable bay.
      15.4.4. Courtesy storage areas.
      15.4.5. Any other applicable holding/storage areas not noted above.
   15.5. If discrepancies still exist after performing the above actions, a second recount will be
   conducted, with the addition of verifying ―LITE‖ box contents. If discrepancies still exist
   after the second recount, perform the following procedures:
      15.5.1. Process a transaction history on the affected NSN back to the date of last
      inventory (DOLI).
      15.5.2. Collect all documents currently out of file and movement control forms for
      affected NSN/lot number.
      15.5.3. Compare source/input documentation against all transactions reflected on the
      transaction history beginning from the DOLI.
      15.5.4. Compare all movement control forms against transaction history.
      15.5.5. Research all custody accounts with the same NSN.
      15.5.6. Verify assets are not pending transportation.
   15.6. If the discrepancy still can’t be resolved, the MASO must initiate inventory adjustment
   procedures.
16. Loss/Damage Procedures.
   16.1. Discrepancies between accountable records and on-hand balances may be discovered
   during inventory or while accomplishing day-to-day operations. In either case, the 45 SW
   MASO must be notified immediately, and discrepancies must be thoroughly investigated to
   determine the cause.
16. 2. Commanders must submit a Report of Survey (ROS) if negligence, willful
misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use of munitions is suspected or when the loss
involves the following controlled inventory item codes (CIICs):
      16.2.1. Category 1 - Very high risk.
      16.2.2. Category 2 - High risk.
      16.2.3. Category C - Confidential, 6, or 8.
      16.2.4. Category S - Secret or 5.
      16.2.5. Category T - Top Secret.
   16.3. In addition, the commander must submit a ROS for all adjustments to custody account
   balances unless the adjustment:
 12                                                       45SWI21-201 20 DECEMBER 2011


      16.3.1. Is a one-time loss of category 3 (moderate risk) munitions of 20 or fewer items
      valued at $200 or less.
      16.3.2. Is a one-time loss of a category 4 and 7 (low risk) or U (unclassified) munitions
      of 200 or fewer items valued at $250 or less.
      16.3.3. Commanders may elect to process a ROS, regardless of criteria.
17. Suspended/Restricted Munitions Procedures.
   17.1. Suspended munitions are those munitions that have been withdrawn from issue and
   use, either temporarily or permanently, because they are either known to be or suspected of
   being unsafe or otherwise defective. Restricted munitions are those munitions that cannot be
   expected to perform satisfactorily under all conditions, but may be used safely within certain
   prescribed limitations.
   17.2. The Munitions Operations Office will provide immediate notification of suspended or
   restricted munitions to all current or former users via e-mail using the “read receipt” option
   in MS Outlook. Upon notification issued munitions are suspended or restricted, the
   munitions user will conduct a thorough search of all assets, placing particular emphasis on
   screening munitions installed in aircraft and life support equipment, mobility packages, and
   issues in support of war mobility commitments.
   17.3. The suspended or restricted munitions will be immediately turned in to the Munitions
   Office and a new lot number will be issued.
18. Failed to Function Munitions.
   18.1. If any munitions fail to function, custodians will notify the Munitions Office within 24
   hours. The Munitions Inspector will attempt to determine probable cause and recommend
   corrective actions. Munitions Inspection will notify the Item Manager/Equipment Specialist
   in accordance with T.O. 00-35D-54.
19. Munitions Requirements Forecasting.
   19.1. All organizations that use munitions are required to submit a yearly munitions
   requirements forecast. Tenant units will ensure, through their MAJCOM Munitions User
   Functional Manager (MUFM), Patrick AFB-assigned munitions org and shop codes are
   loaded in the Agile Munitions Support Tool (AMST) Hill site to reflect current year
   allocations authorized for each munitions account. Tenant units will also ensure, through
   their MFUM, accurate functional account codes are loaded for each asset in their particular
   account. Any asset incorrectly identified will be corrected within 5 working days of
   notification. The Munitions Office will provide an instruction letter and example format for
   forecasting.
   19.2. Custodians are required to load and verify their forecast using procedures assigned by
   the 784th Combat Sustainment Group (CBSG), Ogden Air Logistics Center. The forecast
   instruction letter notification will posted to the 784 CBSG website:
   https://www.my.af.mil/ammoprod/wm/.
   19.3. The annual munitions forecast is the primary vehicle to request and allocate munitions
   required for training and operations needs. It is the single most important report submitted,
45SWI21-201 20 DECEMBER 2011                                                                   13


   and its accuracy and validity cannot be over-emphasized. For additional information, refer to
   AFI 21-201, Chapter 14.2.
20. Allocation Process.
   20.1. On 1 October or the first duty day of October, the CAS System Administrator (SA)
   will process an AMC12A, Level Reconciliation Listing Report. A copy of this report will be
   made accessible to the 45 SW MASO.
       20.1.1. Once current allocated quantities for each NSN by account number (to include
       Cat Code) are accurately loaded, one more AMC12A will be processed and validated
       against the appropriate allocation document. All discrepancies will be corrected
       immediately.
       20.1.2. The AMC12A and the allocation documents will be provided to the 45 SW
       MASO for approval and signature, and all copies of the AMC12As will be filed on the
       share drive.
   20.2. After receipt of the allocations and no later than 45 days prior to the end of the fiscal
   year, the 45 SW MASO/designated representative will inform custodians of excess munitions
   requiring turn-in actions by NSN, quantity, and category code. Custodians will have assets
   turned in NLT 14 days after notification.
   20.3. All changes made to the allocation will be filed electronically in the account electronic
   files folder.
21. Mobility Requirements.
   21.1. Training. When munitions units deploy expendable training assets to an established
   SRAN/DODACC for longer than 60 days, transfer accountability to the gaining MASO. If
   the deployment is originally planned for less than 60 days but extends, the losing MASO
   coordinates with the gaining MASO to transfer accountability. Tactical-ferried, non-
   expendable training assets (i.e., captive carry missiles) are considered part of the aircraft.
   Accountability is retained by the home-station MASO, regardless of deployment duration.
   21.2. Custody Accounts. If custodians require shipment of assets via the transportation
   activity to an established SRAN/DODAAC, a request will be submitted to the Munitions
   Section and appropriate shipment documents will be processed. Shipment documents must
   be forwarded to the gaining MASO.
       21.2.1. If units are deploying with assets on custody accounts and time does not permit
       actual turn-in and shipment of the assets, custodians will submit the required
       documentation for processing the deployment action (paperwork transaction only). A
       shipment document will be given to the deployment custodian(s) to give to the MASO at
       the deployed location. If time does not allow custodian(s) to obtain the shipment
       document(s) to take with the munitions, the losing MASO will mail the document(s) to
       the gaining MASO.
   21.3. The Installation Deployment Officer (IDO) or deployed commander will designate a
   responsible individual to maintain accountability of assets until turned in to the home station
   or deployed MASO. This can be accomplished by handcarrying or completing an AF FORM
   68 for the deployed location.
 14                                                      45SWI21-201 20 DECEMBER 2011


   21.4. USAF members who are deploying and do not have an established munitions custody
   account will contact the 45 SW MASO to receive small arms ammo for the weapons being
   handcarried. The 45 SW MASO/designated representatives will process a shipment
   document with the ship to location SRAN/DoDAAC, if known. If the SRAN/DoDAAC is
   unknown, the MASO will use FV9999.
   21.5. The following statement will be on the back of the shipment document(s) and briefed
   to the member by the MASO/MASO representative. ―Small arms ammunition will be
   controlled and the person receiving the munitions must maintain accountability and lot
   number integrity for these assets. The shipping document and munitions will be turned in to
   the Air Force munitions storage area at the deployed location. If a storage area has not
   been established, member will retain accountability for these assets. Member will document
   on the back of the shipment document if assets are expended or turned over to any other
   military storage area (Army, Navy, etc.). If turned over to a military authority, member will
   receive documentation showing who accepted accountability for the assets (i.e., name, rank,
   SSN, organization, home-base DSN). This documentation will be given to the home station
   MASO upon return from deployment.”
22. Lot Number Integrity.
   22.1. Custodians are responsible for maintaining lot number integrity on all items issued to
   their custody account.
   22.2. Small arms ammunition removed from original packaging and installed in clips will
   have the lot number written on the outside of the clips.
23. Transportation (On/Off Base).
   23.1. The vehicle operator must have a complete understanding of the explosive hazards
   involved and emergency procedures. The individual must also meet the qualification
   requirements of AFMAN 91-201.
   23.2. The vehicle operator must ensure munitions cargo is stable and secure on transporting
   vehicle prior to movement. Explosives will not be transported in the passenger
   compartment of a vehicle or in privately owned vehicles (POVs).
   23.3. The vehicle must display appropriate Department of Transportation (DOT) placards on
   all four sides of vehicle. Exception: Not required for 1.4, less than 1,000 pounds net
   explosive weight (NEW).
   23.4. Transporting vehicle must be equipped with two serviceable fire extinguishers, each
   rated at least 2A:10BC.
   23.5. NO SMOKING! Will be observed while transporting explosives.                Smoking is
   prohibited within 50 feet of an explosives-laden vehicle.
   23.6. For small arms (1.4), the vehicle operator must ensure the vehicles and equipment are
   serviceable and inspected prior to use. Prior to off-base movements on public roads, perform
   an inspection using DD Form 626, Motor Vehicle Inspection, and DD Form 836, Shipping
   Paper and Emergency Response Information for Hazardous Materials Transported by
   Government Vehicles.
45SWI21-201 20 DECEMBER 2011                                                                15


   23.7. Ensure the proper primary and alternate explosive movement routes are selected prior
   to the operation.

providing links and other information to all areas of Air Force practices. The PLSSC CoP is
your link to all your munitions custodian account needs. You will request issues, process turn-
ins and expenditures, get access to inventories, get information on upcoming events, and obtain
all sorts of information you may need. It’s kind of a ―one-stop shop‖ for all your ―Ammo‖
needs.

4. The first step in your process is to request access to our CoP using the link below. Once
given access, take some time to familiarize yourself with the page layout. On the left-hand side,
you’ll see links for issue, turn-in, and expenditure requests. Click on the link and open a form;
look at the information required and become familiar with it.

5. If you look in the middle, you’ll see a set of folder links. These folders will contain basic
information for your account, forms for your use, operating instructions, training manuals, and
other useful information. Again, open the folders and look around.

6. This is the first step in establishing your paperless munitions account. So please, visit the link
and request access; we’ll set you up. Additionally, we will need to grant you access to the 45
LRF ―Ammo‖ share folder; please let us know if you cannot access folders on the ―Patrick‖
share drives.

7. If you experience any problems while viewing the page, please let us know right away. We’ll
do our best to get your problems resolved.
