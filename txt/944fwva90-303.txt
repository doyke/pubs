                                                   You can get help quickly and fairly under the Air Force IG
                                                    Complaint Program and you can make your complaint at
                                                    any level in the IG system without fear of reprisal.

                                                   The Inspector General Complaint Program is described in
                                                   AFI 90-301. This publication tells you how to file a
                                                   complaint and to whom. You may go to any IG at any
                                                   level, but experience has shown that supervisors, first
                                                   sergeants, and commanders can best resolve complaints.
                                                   For this reason, you are encouraged to discuss your
                                                   problem with them before seeing the IG.
