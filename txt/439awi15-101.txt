                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. The 439th Operations Support Squadron Weather Flight (439 OSS/OSAW) in
conjunction with the 15th Operational Weather Squadron (15 OWS), Scott AFB, IL provides
and/or arranges for weather support to the 439th Airlift Wing (439 AW) and other units assigned
to Westover Air Reserve Base (WARB). The 439 OSS/OSAW will also provide or arrange for
day-to-day weather support to Department of Defense (DoD) civilian contractors who request
weather information to support government-funded, on-base projects.
     1.1.1. The 439 OSS/OSAW is a DoD civilian government operation and will hereafter be
     referred to as the Weather Flight (WF) or 439 OSS/OSAW.
     1.1.2. The WF is the focal point for all weather services. This instruction will be reviewed
     annually and updated as required.
1.2. Background.
     1.2.1. The 15 OWS at Scott AFB, IL provides the regional operational-level weather
     products and information to Air Force and Army units in the northeast region of the
     Continental United States (CONUS).
1.3. Responsibilities. Specific responsibilities of the 15 OWS and the WARB WF are defined
in    the     Unit    Data     Page     hosted       on    the  15     OWS   website     at
https://ows.scott.af.mil/Tailored_Met/index.cfm?fuseaction=showunit&B_ICAO=KCEF&
UNIT_ID=106&UID=106&BW=H&UF=M&AOR=1&AOI=.
     1.3.1. The 15 OWS issues WARB Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFs), will provide
     weather briefings to transient aircrews passing through that cannot be supported by the WF,
     issues observed lightning warnings when the WF is closed, and issues forecast weather
     watches, warnings, and advisories. The 15 OWS will collaborate with the WF on the
     issuance of all TAFs and forecast watches, warnings, and advisories.
     1.3.2. The WF will issue all observed warnings, create tailored weather products focused on
     the local mission, provide the “eyes forward” function to the 15 OWS, and collaborate on
     forecast weather products (TAFs, Watches, Warnings, Advisories, etc.) with the 15 OWS
     during WF duty hours. Additionally, the WF will support the base in educating agencies on
     the purpose and applicability of weather products as required by regulation AFI 10-2501, Air
     Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations, or directed by the
     439 AW/CC.
     1.3.3. The WF will augment observations provided by the Automated Meteorological
     Observing System (AMOS) using “supplementing” and/or “back-up” procedures based on
     the AFMAN 15-111 and local policy. See Chapter 2. The WF will also ensure all
     observations that are not disseminated due to equipment or communication problems are
     passed on to the 15 OWS and the WARB Air Traffic Control Tower (TWR) for operational
     aviation and forecast purposes.
1.4. Duty Priorities.
439AWI15-101 23 AUGUST 2013                                                                    7


   1.4.1. WF duty priorities are listed in Table 1.1. WF Meteorological Technicians will use
   good judgment and Operational Risk Management (ORM) in complying with these duty
   priorities, especially when there is imminent danger to life and/or property.

1.5. Operational Hours. Services are normally provided from 0600 Local to 2300 Local, 7
days a week, including holidays. Meteorological Technicians performing these services can be
 8                                                           439AWI15-101 23 AUGUST 2013


contacted at DSN 589-2879 or Comm (413) 557-2879. Services during the hours 2300 Local to
0600 Local are provided by the 15 OWS, DSN 576-9755 or Comm (618) 256-9698. Requests for
locally provided services during the hours 2300 Local to 0600 Local must be forwarded to the
439 OSS/OSAW Weather Station Manager as far in advance as possible.
1.6. Assumptions, Shortfalls, and Limitations.
     1.6.1. Assumptions. Weather support can only be provided if the appropriate facilities,
     funding, communications, personnel, and indigenous support (e.g., power, water, etc.) are
     available.
     1.6.2. Shortfalls. Some services may not always be available due to station evacuation or
     other higher priority missions or duties (e.g., out of station briefings).
     1.6.3. Limitations. Surface weather observing has buildings obstructing the view of the
     horizon from south through southwest and to some extent west through north.
1.7. Meteorological Equipment. Readouts for all meteorological sensors are located at the
Base Operations, Building 1610.
     1.7.1. The primary sensor group is located on the approach end of Runway 23,
     approximately 1097’ from the threshold and 513’ off the runway.
        1.7.1.1. The 23 end primary sensors include wind, ice accretion, cloud height,
        visibility/runway visual range (RVR), precipitation identification, temperature/relative
        humidity, ambient light, rain bucket (tipping bucket), lightning detection, and pressure.
     1.7.2. The discontinuity sensor group is located on the approach end of Runway 05,
     approximately 2130’ from the displaced threshold and 87’ off the runway.
        1.7.2.1. The 05 end discontinuity sensor includes wind, cloud height, and
        visibility/runway visual range (RVR).
     1.7.3. Another discontinuity sensor group is located on the approach end of Runway
     33, approximately 1033’ from the threshold and 572’ off the runway.
        1.7.3.1. The 33 end discontinuity sensor includes wind and visibility/runway visual range
        (RVR).
1.8. Communications Equipment. Just as vital as meteorological equipment, communications
equipment allows the WF to get the right information to the customer. The following systems
are the backbone of the WF communications network.
     1.8.1. Local Area Network (LAN). The WF relies heavily on the LAN to receive all forecast
     tools and to operate all weather systems. This improves the timeliness and accuracy of
     weather intelligence to our customers.
     1.8.2. Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET). This is the primary system for disseminating
     weather forecasts, observations, warnings, watches, and advisories. This system relies on the
     LAN and 15 OWS communications to function properly.
     1.8.3. Pilot-to-Metro Service Radio (PMSV). The PMSV radio (274.75 MHz (UHF)) allows
     the WF to communicate with aircrews and TWR personnel.
439AWI15-101 23 AUGUST 2013                                                                    9


   1.8.4. Phones/Hotlines. Phones and hotlines primarily serve as a back-up system for
   disseminating critical, time-sensitive information rapidly.
1.9. Alternate (Back-up) Operating Location (AOL). In the event of a building evacuation,
the WF will move to the Westover Fire Station, Building 7084, Room 35, to continue operational
support and their “eyes forward” responsibilities to the 15 OWS. WF Meteorological
Technicians will resume operations at the AOL using Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) and
back-up equipment, as required. An observation will be disseminated within 15 minutes of
relocating to the AOL if augmenting. Weather services from the AOL may be limited.
   1.9.1. If electrical power/LAN communications are still available, weather sensor
   information will be accessible.          If electrical power/LAN communications are
   impacted/disrupted, backup equipment will be used as needed. The wind and pressure
   element of the observation will be estimated whenever back-up equipment is in use.
   1.9.2. The WF will not have access to their local Doppler/WSR-88D radar data for storm
   interrogation and the PMSV radio.
   1.9.3. Dissemination of longline observations will be through JET. If unable to upload
   through JET, Air Force Weather Web Services (AFW-WEBS) will be used as the primary
   backup.
   1.9.4. Local dissemination of observations, watches, warnings, and advisories will be done
   via telephone if normal dissemination through JET is unavailable.
1.10. Release of Weather Information to Non-Department of Defense Agencies and
Individuals. The National Weather Service (NWS) is the agency with the primary responsibility
for providing government weather services to non-Department of Defense agencies and the
general public. Any inquiries to gather weather information will be forwarded to the local NWS
office or to WARB Public Affairs (PA) for review and approval.
1.11. Aircraft or Ground Mishaps. The WF has a role when advised of an emergency or
mishap. The WF will ensure applicable weather data used in the development of any product
and/or service provided is saved for an investigation (e.g., MWPs, MEFs, space weather
products, radar, briefing slides, etc.). The WF will save data to fully reconstruct the
environmental conditions involved. These steps include:
   1.11.1. Follow local data save procedures using JET.
   1.11.2. Save radar imagery.
   1.11.3. Coordinate with the 15 OWS to initiate a data save, as appropriate.
   1.11.4. If the WF used products from other OWSs to support the mission involved, the WF
   must coordinate with all applicable OWSs to initiate a data save.
   1.11.5. Coordinate with Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) Operations at DSN 271-2586
   to save any applicable data and products not available locally.
   1.11.6. If an aircraft mishap is involved, ensure all the procedures of AFMAN 15-129V2,
   Air and Space Weather Operations – Exploitation, Chapter 3, paragraph 3.5., are followed.
   1.11.7. Provide all necessary assistance as required by 439 AW Mishap Investigation Plan.
   1.11.8. Retrieve archived surface observations upon request.
 10                                                         439AWI15-101 23 AUGUST 2013


                                           Chapter 2

                                   AIRFIELD SERVICES

2.1. General. Airfield services include those actions that affect the WARB aerodrome,
(defined as within 5 nautical miles (NM) of the center of the airfield). Examples include surface
weather observations, PMSV, and resource protection (weather watches, warnings, and
advisories). Resource protection will be addressed separately in Chapter 6.
2.2. Surface Weather Observations. Surface weather observations are taken, encoded,
recorded, and disseminated in accordance with AFMAN 15-111, Surface Weather Observations.
   2.2.1. Automated Meteorological Observing System (AMOS). WARB is an automated
   weather observing station equipped with an AMOS. The AMOS in use is the Air Force’s
   FMQ-19 system.
   2.2.2. Official Observing Site. The official observing site is the sensor group and will be
   determined by the current active runway in use. When augmenting, the official observing
   site is located on the northeast corner of Building 1610 by the manual rain gauge.
   2.2.3. Types of Surface Weather Observations:
       2.2.3.1. Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR) observations are taken and
       disseminated every hour between 58 and 59 minutes after the hour.
       2.2.3.2. Aviation Selected Special Weather Report (SPECI) observations are taken
       whenever certain specified criteria are observed per the AFMAN 15-111. Additional
       SPECI criteria for ceiling, visibility, and runway visual range (RVR) are determined
       specifically for WARB based on flying information published in the Flight Information
       Publication (FLIP), Notice to Airmen (NOTAM), and in the 439 AW Flying Operations
       Supplement, AFI 11-2C-5V3. See Attachment 2 for WARB SPECI criteria. Note:
       While Attachment 2 lists WARB SPECI criteria at the time of publishing this instruction,
       SPECI criteria is subject to change and is kept up-to-date in the local Cooperative
       Weather Watch (CWW) agreement. See the local CWW agreement for the latest SPECI
       criteria published for WARB or contact the WF.
   2.2.4. Augmentation. Augmentation is the process of having position qualified, certified
   Meteorological Technicians manually add or edit data to an observation generated by a
   properly sited AMOS. Meteorological Technicians will perform augmentation in accordance
   with the AFMAN 15-111. The two augmentation processes used are “supplementing” and
   “back-up”.
       2.2.4.1. Supplementing. A method of manually adding meteorological information to
       an automated observation that is beyond the capabilities of the AMOS to detect and/or
       report. Per the AFMAN 15-111, WARB Meteorological Technicians will supplement for
       the following and provide a Basic Weather Watch (BWW) when the following conditions
       are forecast to occur within 1 hour:
           2.2.4.1.1. Tornado, Funnel Cloud, Waterspout
           2.2.4.1.2. Hail (> 1/2 inch)
439AWI15-101 23 AUGUST 2013                                                                 11


        2.2.4.1.3. Volcanic Ash
        2.2.4.1.4. Ice Pellets
        2.2.4.1.5. Snow depth (only if a heavy snow warning has been issued, snowfall is
        occurring, and it is during airfield operating hours.)
        2.2.4.1.6. Remarks for tornadic activity indicating beginning/ending times,
        location, direction, and movement if known.
            Note: The criteria listed above will be supplemented when the airfield open.
            However, tornadic activity (Tornado, Funnel Cloud, Waterspout) will also
            be supplemented even during airfield closure periods.
     2.2.4.2. Local Supplementing Criteria. Based on ORM and known local weather
     situations particular to WARB that are frequently beyond AMOS’s capabilities and/or are
     limitations of the automated equipment, the criteria listed below will be supplemented by
     the Meteorological Technicians when the airfield is open, unless otherwise noted. These
     situations will be supplemented based on duty priorities and are situations that could
     adversely impact flight/ground operations, safety, or pose a threat to mission success.
        2.2.4.2.1. Ground Fog (MIFG)/Patchy Fog (BCFG). This is a frequent occurrence
        near the Runway 23 sensor group and on occasion can affect the Runway 05 and 33
        sensor groups as well. This will cause the sensor to falsely report the prevailing
        visibility below 3 SM and, on occasion, below 1 SM when the actual prevailing
        visibility is +7 SM. Note: RVR in these situations will continue to be reported
        despite supplementation of the visibility. RVR is not an augmentable parameter per
        AFMAN 15-111.
        2.2.4.2.2. Thunderstorms. Due to limitations of AMOS’s lightning detection
        system, thunderstorms and, therefore, lightning could be occurring and not detected
        or reported by AMOS.           Due to safety, supplementation will occur when
        Meteorological Technicians are issuing Observed Lightning Warnings for within 5
        NM and 10 NM of WARB when thunderstorms are observed and/or detected on other
        lightning detection system (i.e., AFW-WEBS).
        2.2.4.2.3. Freezing Rain/Freezing Drizzle. Due to the significant impact of
        freezing precipitation to operations, supplementation will occur when it is actually
        occurring and not being detected or reported by AMOS. Also, supplementation will
        occur when freezing precipitation is being reported by AMOS and it is NOT actually
        occurring. This can occur when wet, sticky snow is falling.
        2.2.4.2.4. Drizzle/Freezing Drizzle. Drizzle is not always detected by AMOS and
        could have an impact on the visibility, which can also go undetected. If it is freezing
        drizzle, a more significant kind of icing is occurring that could impact aviation
        operations and will be supplemented for operational and forecasting purposes.
        2.2.4.2.5. Correct precipitation type and/or report mixed precipitation. There
        are situations, especially in the winter, where AMOS will not report the correct type
        of precipitation that is occurring. This may be significant to operations and forecasts
        (i.e., icing forecasts, warnings, snow/ice removal, etc.).
 12                                                         439AWI15-101 23 AUGUST 2013


          2.2.4.2.6. Clouds and Visibility. Due to some limitations on cloud and visibility
          sensing with AMOS, certain situations may require supplementation when flight
          safety and mission impact are at risk, especially when conditions are below 3000 FT
          and 3 SM. WARB SPECI criteria will be considered when augmenting for clouds
          and visibility.
          2.2.4.2.7. Rapidly Changing Conditions. Due to AMOS’s time averaging methods,
          rapidly changing conditions are not handled well and a significant reporting delay
          occurs. This could adversely impact flight operations.
          2.2.4.2.8. Unknown Precipitation (UP). Due to the frequency that AMOS reports
          UP, especially in the winter, supplementation will occur to report the actual
          precipitation that is occurring for operational and forecasting purposes.
          2.2.4.2.9. False reports due to bugs/bees. This is a frequent occurrence Spring
          through Fall. Bugs/bees will cause false reports of drizzle, rain, or UP to occur that
          will be supplemented for operational and forecasting purposes.
          2.2.4.2.10. Hail during airfield closure periods. The WF will supplement for hail
          > 1/2 inch during airfield closure periods when on duty for Severe Weather Action
          Plan (SWAP) procedures. This will ensure documentation and accurate verification
          for any hail related damage sustained by WARB.
          2.2.4.2.11. Precipitation Amounts. The WF will supplement liquid precipitation
          amounts when AMOS values are unrepresentative due to its limitations. This can
          occur during windy conditions, isolated local events, winter precipitation, and when
          false reports of precipitation occur. This will ensure accuracy of local climatological
          records that are used by various base agencies.
          2.2.4.2.12. Anything else in the Meteorological Technician’s opinion that may affect
          flight/ground operations, safety, and/or any mission.
       2.2.4.3. Back-up. A method of manually providing meteorological data and/or
       dissemination to an AMOS observation when the primary, automated method is not
       operational or unavailable due to sensor and/or communication failure. Meteorological
       Technicians must maintain situational awareness of current weather conditions and
       AMOS observations.
   2.2.5. Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW). A process is in place to allow WARB TWR
   personnel and flying units to report changes in weather conditions or significant
   meteorological phenomena to the Meteorological Technician at DSN 589-2879 or Comm
   (413) 557-2879. See Chapter 7 for details.
2.3. Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFs). WARB TAFs are produced and disseminated by
the 15 OWS. The 15 OWS collaborates with the WF prior to TAF dissemination during WF
duty hours. TAFs are valid for 30 hours and apply to the area within 5 NM of the center of the
WARB aerodrome. Individual elements in the TAF will be forecast, as possible. The WF will
issue all TAFs should the 15 OWS become unable to provide them.
   2.3.1. TAF specification and amendment criteria are listed in AFMAN 15-129V1, Table
   3.10. Ceiling and visibility TAF amendment criteria specific to WARB are listed below in
   Table 2.1.
439AWI15-101 23 AUGUST 2013                                                                 13

2.4. “Eyes Forward” Process. This is the process by which the WF relays significant, time-
sensitive meteorological information not found in coded meteorological reports to the 15 OWS.
The process permits the WF to provide meaningful meteorological information to enhance the 15
OWS’s METWATCH process. Additionally, the WF assists in translating the current state of the
atmosphere and relays potential local weather effects that will impact weather conditions at
WARB and its operations. This helps form an integrated, site specific weather forecast for
WARB that takes into account local weather effects and enhances mission safety and success.
2.5. Pilot to Metro Service (PMSV) Support. The WF operates a PMSV on the frequency of
274.75 MHz (UHF). It is the primary means of disseminating weather information to airborne
aircraft. A daily radio check will be performed no later than 0800L. Back-up for this system is
via the WARB TWR.
2.6. Emergency Management Support. The WF will provide climatological data and
specialized support to 439 MSG/CEX to include Chemical Downwind Messages (CDM) and/or
Effective Downwind Messages (EDM), or any weather data necessary to calculate toxic
corridors. See Chapter 6 for more details.

                                    MISSION SERVICES

3.1. General. Mission services are those products providing weather input affecting each
customer’s daily mission. The primary products for accomplishing this are Mission Weather
Products (MWP). The MWP is used to refine large-scale forecast products, in both time and
space, on order to provide the environmental information necessary to make operational
decisions regarding specific missions.
3.2. MWP. MWPs are essentially mission-specific forecasts provided by a number of methods
such as verbal briefs, mass briefings, electronic briefs, etc.
   3.2.1. The WF will generate a MWP by fusing and tailoring strategic and theater weather
   center products, as well as, information supplied by local units and agencies. MWPs must be
   horizontally consistent with, but not necessarily mirror, products issued by the strategic and
   theater centers such as AFWA and the 15 OWS respectively. The end result is a
   product/information designed to provide tailored, timely, accurate, and relevant weather
   intelligence to various customers by whatever means proves most effective. MWPs are
   provided for either flying or non-flying missions as required by the specific mission/activity.
3.3. 337 AS Flight MEF. A flight MEF (Mission Execution Forecast) is a MWP that is
developed from mission information provided by the Global Decision Support System (GDSS)-2
and the Wing Operations Plan (WOP).
   3.3.1. The WF will provide a flight MEF for all 337 AS, non-IFM (Integrated Flight
   Mission), missions departing WARB.
   3.3.2. Support for 337 AS, non-IFM, missions departing from other locations can be
   provided by the WF during duty hours but will be at the mission aircraft commander’s
   discretion. The WF can be contacted at DSN 589-2879 or Comm (413) 557-2879 to provide
   weather support or assist in arranging it.
      3.3.2.1. It will be the aircraft commander’s decision to decide who will be more
      practical/appropriate in providing weather support for the mission when not departing
      from WARB (Westover WF, local base WF, or supporting OWS for the location).
      He/she will be responsible for arranging weather support but the WF can provide the
      support or assist with arranging the support upon request.
      3.3.2.2. If the aircraft commander requests that the WF provide support, he/she will keep
      the WF up-to-date on any changes or mission delays so they can evaluate the MEF for
      potential updates. They will also provide contact information and the preferred means of
      delivering the MEF.
      3.3.2.3. The following outlines future brief instructions and contact information for the
      WARB WF and OWSs. This information will be provided at the end of all 337 AS, non-
      IFM, MEFs departing WARB so future contact information is available for the mission:

  3.3.3. Weather support for IFM missions are provided by the 618 AOC (TACC)/XOW at
  Scott AFB, IL who will provide the official brief. See Attachment 3 for an example.
     3.3.3.1. For IFM missions departing WARB, the WF will post a basic slide consisting of
     the current WARB TAF and the TAF for the first destination.
     3.3.3.2. The WF can also provide current satellite and radar imagery at the weather
     station upon request.
  3.3.4. Flight MEFs provided by the WF will be posted to the base “Y” drive at
  Y:\OG\337\ALL\Flying Briefs\WX Briefs.
  3.3.5. Flight MEFs will be posted 4 hours 15 minutes prior to the departure time when
  possible but, at a minimum, will be posted 3 hours 15 minutes prior in order to meet the
  aircrew briefing time.
     3.3.5.1. Any briefings that would need to be posted during the normal WF closure period
     (2300L to 0600L) to meet the minimum 3 hours 15 minutes posting will be coordinated
     with the Weather Station Manager as soon as possible. Please note a minimum of 1 hour
     is needed to prepare a flight MEF.
     3.3.5.2. A copy of a flight MEF and current satellite and radar imagery can be obtained
     at the weather station upon request.
     3.3.5.3. Any questions related to the MEF can be addressed to the Meteorological
     Technician at the weather station.
439AWI15-101 23 AUGUST 2013                                                               17


   3.3.6. MEFs include all pertinent weather information affecting the flying missions.
   Example flight MEFs are given in Attachment 3.
   3.3.7. Aircrew members may receive a verbal briefing relative to a specific WF flight MEF
   at the weather station or by the calling the Meteorological Technician at DSN 589-2879 or
   Comm (413) 557-2879.
   3.3.8. For any exercises (ORI, ORE, etc.) that will take place away from WARB, the
   Weather Station Manager will arrange the weather support either by reaching back to the
   WARB WF or by submitting a SAR request to the appropriate servicing OWS if requested
   by the 337 AS.
3.4. Sensitivities and Limitations Employed in the Development of MWPs. Several sources
will be used by the Meteorological Technicians when developing MWPs so as to focus efforts on
known weather sensitivities and limitations that may have a “Go/No Go” impact on the mission.
   3.4.1. Airframe-Specific Weather Limitations. The 15 OWS Operational Weather Limiters
   (OWL) provides all known weather limitations for C-5 operations and any other transient
   operation as well. The information compiled in the OWL is based on Air Force publications
   and      can       be      found      on      the     15      OWS        website       at
   https://ows.scott.af.mil/Tech_Ref/owl/index.cfm.
   3.4.2. Flight Mission Weather Limitations/Restrictions. Weather thresholds for flight MEFs
   and MISSIONWATCH will be considered and are in accordance with AFI 11-202V3 and
   AFI 11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP_I.
   3.4.3. The base weather limitations that have an impact on operations at WARB are outlined
   below in Table 3.1.

Table 3.1. WARB Base Weather Limitations.

3.5. Space Weather. Space weather products are primarily provided by utilizing information
available                      on                   AFW-WEBS                             at
https://weather.af.mil/confluence/display/AFWWEBSTBT/Space+Weather+Main+Page.
3.6. Updates. Flight MEFs will be updated whenever forecast weather crosses amendment and
“GO/NO GO” thresholds. The acting Operations Supervisor (OPSUP) will be notified via
Command Post (CP) or directly by the WF if updates are significant and mission limiting.
3.7. MISSIONWATCH. MISSIONWATCH provides an organized approach for
Meteorological Technicians to continuously monitor routes, areas, and installations for
significant changes to weather products.
   3.7.1. MISSIONWATCH will focus on mission-limiting thresholds for the specific mission
   or associated units and notify customers when parameters cross these thresholds.
   3.7.2. Meteorological Technicians will provide alternatives to exploit mission weather and
   update environmental information through a continuous Mission Execution Forecast Process
   (MEFP).
   3.7.3. All on-site meteorological data sources will be used to accomplish
   MISSIONWATCH. Airfield Management Operations (AMOPS) will notify the WF when
   missions depart and arrive. The WF will be given access to GDSS-2 for awareness and
   MISSIONWATCH.
   3.7.4. During rapidly changing weather, the WF will amend/update the flight MEF as
   required and contact the CP to pass on changes or contact the OPSUP/aircrew themselves if
   changes are critical.
3.8. Transient Aircraft Weather Briefings. Westover WF Meteorological Technicians will
provide transient aircrews traditional flight weather briefings, for non-IFM missions ONLY,
utilizing the DD Form 175-1 (Flight Weather Briefing) or local verbal briefing procedures.
Updates to an existing flight weather briefing will be provided upon request.
   3.8.1. Transient briefings will be made available in the weather station or via phone.
   3.8.2. Updates to an existing IFM supported mission will be coordinated with 618
   AOC(TACC)/XOW at DSN 779-0353 or Comm (618) 229-0353 when significant changes
   have occurred.
   3.8.3. If the WF cannot support a transient aircrew due to hours of operation or other duty
   and mission priorities, the 15 OWS has the primary responsibility to provide weather
   briefings to transient aircraft. Briefings can be requested through the 15 OWS web page at
   https://ows.scott.af.mil/wx_brief/index.cfm?fuseaction=request&UID=106&BW=H&UF
   =M&AOR=1&USEHF=1 or by calling DSN 576-9755 or Comm (618) 256-9755.
   3.8.4. The WF will support Air Combat Command Air Operations Squadron (ACC AOS)
   controlled missions, which included CORONET movements, with launch, alternate, abort,
   and destination base forecasts but must use the ACC AOS/AOSW weather flight’s Control
   Mission Weather Product (CMWP) for the enroute and air refueling track portion of the
   brief. Any briefing support needed outside of WF hours of operation will be coordinated with
   the Weather Station Manager as soon as possible.
439AWI15-101 23 AUGUST 2013                                                                   19


3.9. Non-Flight MWP. Non-Flight MWPs are developed in response to any non-flying
operational mission being conducted. The scope, format, and delivery method will be
determined in coordination with the requestor.
3.10. WARB Snow and Ice Plan. Snow and ice removal crews are normally not scheduled
outside of normal duty hours, Mon-Fri. The WF will therefore send a Snow and Ice Plan
Notification for weather events requiring snow and/or ice removal of trace amounts or more from
the runway/base so crews, equipment, and the possible use of chemicals can be planned and
staged in advance.
   3.10.1. Snow and Ice Plan Notification Issuance.
       3.10.1.1. Issued around 1300L or earlier, pending other duty priorities, on the duty day
       (Mon-Fri) prior to the event whenever the potential exists for a trace or more of snow
       and/or ice to affect WARB.
       3.10.1.2. For events that are expected to occur on a Sunday, Monday, Holiday, or the day
       after a Holiday, updates should be expected over the weekend or the day prior given the
       weather situation may change (i.e., change in storm track, change in precipitation type,
       change in storm timing, etc.) and require adjustments to such a detailed forecast provided
       that far in advance.
       3.10.1.3. For unanticipated/unpredictable weather events that may produce a trace or
       more of snow or ice, a Snow and Ice Plan Notification will be issued as soon as possible.
       3.10.1.4. Snow and Ice Plan Notifications will be updated, if needed, for adjustments to
       timing, precipitation type, and amounts based on local criteria provided by Real Property
       Maintenance (RPM) and their snow and ice removal operation.
       3.10.1.5. For events or situations in which agencies may need more time to prepare, the
       Weather Station Manager will coordinate with appropriate agencies in advance to see if
       an earlier issuance is needed.
   3.10.2. Snow and Ice Plan Notification Checklist. See Attachment 4 for an example.
       3.10.2.1. The Snow and Ice Plan Notification Checklist will be filled out and contain, at
       a minimum, information on precipitation type, timing, and amounts plus information on
       temperature and wind. It may also contain any remarks that may be pertinent to snow
       and ice removal (e.g., expect blowing and drifting snow, expect temperatures to rise
       above freezing after 0900L, etc.) and an outlook for 12 to 24 hours after the event.
       3.10.2.2. The Snow and Ice Plan Notification Checklist will be emailed to any base
       organization or personnel requesting email notification. Requests to be added or
       removed from the email notification list should be addressed to the Weather Station
       Manager.
       3.10.2.3. Those organizations and their contacts listed on the Snow and Ice Plan
       Notification Checklist will be the only organizations/personnel called by the WF to verify
       receipt of Snow and Ice Plans. See Attachment 4.
   3.10.3. Snow and Ice Plan Notification Coordination. The Weather Station Manager will
   coordinate criteria for snow and ice plan issuance and contact information annually but NLT
   October 1st to ensure local criteria has not changed prior to the season.
 20                                                         439AWI15-101 23 AUGUST 2013


       3.10.3.1. Coordination will take place with the RPM manager (439 CE/PMI), Base Civil
       Engineering (439 MSG/CE), the Airfield Operations Manager (439 OSS/OSA), and the
       Airfield Manager (439 OSS/OSA).
       3.10.3.2. The agencies listed above will notify the Weather Station Manager with any
       changes to criteria or contacts when they occur.
3.11. Westover Five Day Outlook. A general weather five day outlook will be provided daily
for any base agency to use for planning purposes only. This forecast is specific to Westover
ARB and may not be representative of surrounding areas. See Attachment 5 for examples.
   3.11.1. The Westover Five Day Outlook will be posted to the following location on the base
   “Y” drive by 0900L or as workload and duty priorities permit: Y:\OG\337\ALL\Flying
   Briefs\WX Briefs
   3.11.2. During the fall/winter months, a “Winter Precipitation Amount Outlook” will also
   be provided to the general five day outlook and will be based on the following categories:
       3.11.2.1. MINIMAL – Snow: < 1 inch and/or Ice: Trace
       3.11.2.2. MINOR – Snow: > 1 inch to < 6 inches and/or Ice: Trace to < 1/4 inch
       3.11.2.3. MAJOR – Snow: > 6 inch and/or Ice: > 1/4 inch
       3.11.2.4. HIGHLY UNCERTAIN – The weather situation dictates too much
       uncertainty to predict snow and/or ice amounts this far in advance. Customers should
       keep abreast of the upcoming weather situation as it gets closer to the day of the event.
       Note: A detailed Snow and Ice Plan Notification will be sent out one duty day prior to the
       event, even in “HIGHLY UNCERTAIN” weather situations.
   3.11.3. During the spring/summer months, a “Thunderstorm Potential Intensity Outlook”
   will also be provided to the general five day outlook and will be based on the following
   categories:
       3.11.3.1. GENERAL – Wind: < 25 KT and/or Hail: None
       3.11.3.2. WEAK – Wind: > 25 KT to < 35 KT and/or Hail: < 1/4 inch
       3.11.3.3. MODERATE – Wind: > 35 KT to < 50 KT and/or Hail: > 1/4 inch to < 1/2
       inch
       3.11.3.4. SEVERE – Wind: > 50 KT and/or Hail: > 1/2 inch
3.12. Fitness Center 1. 5-Mile Run and 1.0-Mile Walk Forecast. Upon request from 439
FSS/SVMP fitness center personnel, the WF will provide a forecast for the 1.5-mile run and 1.0-
mile walk. See Attachment 6 for an example. A verbal GO/NO GO will be passed on and a
forecast worksheet will be filled out and posted to the Y drive at
Y:\Restricted\MSG\MSS\Fitness\Unit PT Exams weather. Forecasts will be based on the
following criteria per AFI 36-2905, Fitness Program and all criteria must be met in order for
conditions to be a “GO”:
   3.12.1. The air temperature must be > 20F.
   3.12.2. There can be “no significant rain”. 439 FSS/SVMP determined any amount of
   rain/drizzle will make it a “NO GO”.
439AWI15-101 23 AUGUST 2013                                                                       21


   3.12.3. If it is a wet day (i.e., rain, mist, or heavy dew), the temperature, with the wind chill,
   must be > 34F.
   3.12.4. Sustain wind must be < 15 MPH.
   3.12.5. Gusts must be < 20 MPH.

                               STAFF WEATHER SERVICES

4.1. General. Staff services are those briefings and other services provided primarily by WF
leadership. The briefings may be provided in a non-flight MEF format focusing on planning for
a particular event or a general informational brief for a specific audience. Examples include, but
are not limited to, staff meetings, Installation Command Center (ICC) briefings, Crisis Action
Team (CAT) briefings, and Instrument Refresher Course (IRC) briefings. Other services consist
of, but are not limited to, meteorological training for ATC personnel and fulfilling any requests
for meteorological data not provided on a scheduled or routine basis.
4.2. Staff Briefings. Staff weather briefings for 439 AW/CC (Wing Stand-up) will be provided
as required. Standard information includes current synoptic situation, 24 hour synoptic situation,
today’s forecast with maximum/minimum temperatures, five day outlook, and flight following
information for the next 24 hours.
4.3. IRC Briefings. IRC briefings are provided to the 337 AS upon request. Individualized
instruction may be provided depending on technician availability and priority of duties.
4.4. ICC/CAT Briefings. The WF will provide weather briefings as required for ICC/CAT
briefings. This includes real-world emergency, exercise, and deployment briefings. Each
briefing will be tailored to provide the appropriate weather intelligence required by wing
leadership.
4.5. Seasonal Weather Briefings. Upon request, the WF will provide a WF briefer for any
required seasonal weather briefings.
4.6. Pre-deployment Planning Briefings. The WF will provide pre-deployment weather
briefings when requested. The content of the briefing will vary depending on the customer’s
requirements.
4.7. Flight Information Publication (FLIP) Weather Updates. The WF is responsible for
ensuring all weather information in FLIP products is accurate. All weather related revisions,
corrections, or updates will be processed through the Airfield Management FLIP Manager, 439
OSS/OSAA, and submitted directly to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA).
4.8. ATC Limited Observation Training. The WF provides ATC Limited Observation
Training as requested. The ATC individual seeking training will call the Weather Station
Manager at DSN 589-3230 or Comm (413) 557-3230 and schedule an appointment.
4.9. Climatic Data Requests. Requests for climatological data can be made by phone, e-mail,
or in person. The WF will provide climatological data for WARB and other locations either
through locally maintained records or by utilizing the 14 WS/Air Force Combat Climatology
Center (AFCCC) for any requests beyond the local capability to fill.
4.10. Support Assistance Requests (SAR). Any specialized support for terrestrial, space, or
climatological services needed for base agencies or contractors will be handled by the WF. The
WF will submit a SAR request to the appropriate agency.
439AWI15-101 23 AUGUST 2013                                                                    23


                                           Chapter 5

                     SPACE WEATHER SUPPORT AND PRODUCTS

5.1. General. Many AF weapons and communications systems use Global Positioning System
(GPS), satellite communications (SATCOM) and high frequency (HF), very high frequency
(VHF) and ultra-high frequency (UHF) radio waves that can be rendered useless by electro-
magnetic radiation from the sun. This chapter contains some brief information regarding space
weather support, limitations, and products such as space weather analyses, forecasts, alerts, and
warnings.
5.2. Support. The WF will maintain working knowledge of AFWA space weather products to
support Westover missions/systems that could potentially experiencing adverse space weather
affects. Graphic products depicting space weather impacts on military systems have been
created to provide near real-time data on potential system impacts and are available via web
pages from the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) or National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA). Any space weather support requirements that cannot be met by
AFWA’s or NOAA’s available space weather products will require the WF to submit a support
assistance request (SAR) to AFWA. Sufficient time will be required for the SAR process to
generate new products to best satisfy the requirement.
5.3. Limitations. Like terrestrial weather, there are numerous factors that influence space
weather. One of the biggest limitations in identifying and forecasting space weather is a lack of
sensors. Additionally, given the speed of solar wind and light, the ability to provide lead-times
for significant space events can be extremely limited.
5.4. Products. Worldwide space weather products are available utilizing products generated at
AFWA’s strategic weather center and available through AFW-WEBS’ Space Weather Main
Page                                                                                            at
https://weather.af.mil/confluence/display/AFWWEBSTBT/Space+Weather+Main+Page.
Most space weather products from the strategic center are current to very short-term forecasts (6-
hourly periods). Broad coverage CONUS- based space weather graphics products are available at
https://weather.af.mil/confluence/display/AFWWEBSTBT/CONUS%20Regional%20Space
%20Weather. AFW-WEBS products are the primary source used by the WF to provide the
space weather portion of the flight MEF.
5.5. Additional Space Weather Products and Support. Other advanced graphical and textual-
based space weather products are available via space weather web pages from AFWA via AFW-
WEBS’ Space Weather Main Page or NOAA at http://sec.noaa.gov. These websites present
information concerning space weather events, warnings, observations, analyses, forecasts, and
data summaries. Both websites also supply on- line help pages and educational materials
(briefings, product catalogs, and links to other space weather sites). They provide additional
details for these and other space weather products, data, and images. For additional information
or product requests, contact the WF.
5.6. Reporting. Actual space weather impacts experienced by WARB personnel will be
reported either through the WF, any Air Force weather unit, or via the AFW-WEBS site at
https://weather.af.mil/AFW_WEBS/forms/SpaceImpactAssessmentRequest.php.
 24                                                          439AWI15-101 23 AUGUST 2013


                                           Chapter 6

                          RESOURCE PROTECTION SERVICES

6.1. General. Weather watches, warnings, and advisories for WARB are issued for
customer specified/higher authority specified criteria and within a desired lead time (DLT), when
required.
6.2. Support. The 15 OWS is responsible for issuing all forecast weather watches, warnings,
and advisories. During WF duty hours, the 15 OWS and WF collaborate on all products issued.
The WF is responsible for issuing all observed warnings
   6.2.1. As the “eyes forward” for the 15 OWS, the WF can issue a forecast warning if there is
   an immediate threat to life and/or property and there is insufficient time for the 15 OWS to
   issue the weather warning and/or collaboration.
   6.2.2. Additionally, the WF will issue all weather watches, warnings, and advisory products
   should the 15 OWS become unable to provide such products/services.
6.3. Severe Weather Action Plan(SWAP) Procedures. Although the primary responsibility
for resource protection lies with the 15 OWS, the most effective protection comes from the 15
OWS and the WF working together using the “eyes forward” and collaboration processes. When
the potential exists for severe weather to affect WARB, the 15 OWS and WF will implement
SWAP.
   6.3.1. SWAP is used to ensure sufficient personnel are available during potential/actual
   severe weather events or during meteorological and operational events critical to mission
   success.
   6.3.2. It is imperative that timely and accurate weather watches, warnings, and advisories are
   disseminated to all WARB agencies for personnel safety and resource protection.
   6.3.3. The WF will perform SWAP responsibilities as defined in AFMAN 15-111, AFMAN
   15-129V1, AFMAN 15-129V2, AFI 15-128, AFI 10-229, AFMAN 10-206, and in the
   agreement with the 15 OWS documented in the OWS-WF Unit Data Page.
6.4. Limitations. Reports of actual weather conditions received from other than a certified
Meteorological Technician are considered “unofficial” weather observations.
6.5. Weather Watches. Watches are issued whenever atmospheric conditions are forecast to
become favorable for the development of a predefined weather event that poses a threat to life
and property which could “potentially” occur within a 5 NM radium from the center of the
WARB aerodrome.
   6.5.1. Watches are issued 2 hours or more prior to the onset of the criteria listed in Table 6.1
   when possible.
   6.5.2. A watch will be upgraded to a warning should the criteria actually develop or when
   development is imminent and will pose a threat within a 5 NM radius of WARB.

Table 6.1. WARB Weather Watch Criteria.

  *NOTE 1: Blizzard criteria includes a duration > 3 hours, sustained wind
  or gusts > 30 KT, and considerable falling and/or blowing snow with
  prevailing visibility frequently < 1/4 SM. All criteria must be met.

6.6. Weather Warnings. Weather warnings are issued when the criteria in Table 6.2 pose a

  **NOTE 2: Blizzard criteria includes a duration > 3 hours, sustained wind or gusts      > 30 KT,
  and considerable falling and/or blowing snow with prevailing visibility frequently < 1/4 SM. All
  criteria must be met.
   ***NOTE 3: Observed Lightning Warnings are issued by the WARB WF when open. During
   WF closure periods, the 15 OWS at Scott AFB, IL will issue Observed Lightning Warnings
   based on lightning detection systems only. Therefore, ORM should still be exercised by all
   personnel.
6.7. Observed Weather Warnings. Lightning warnings are the only type of “observed”
weather warning issued for WARB. A Meteorological Technician will determine whether
lightning is occurring within 5 NM or 10 NM of WARB and issue/cancel the appropriate
warning when necessary. A lightning warning will remain in effect until a Meteorological
Technician has determined that lightning has not occurred within the distance specified in the
warning, 5 NM or 10 NM, for a minimum of 15 minutes per AFMAN 15-111.
   6.7.1. Observed Lightning Warnings for the area within 5 NM radius of the center point of
   the WARB runway complex are issued in accordance with AFOSH Standards 91-66,
   General Industrial Operations and 91-100, Aircraft Flight Line – Ground Operations and
   Activities.
   6.7.2. Observed Lightning Warnings for the area in a 5 NM-10 NM radius of the center point
   of the WARB runway complex are issued in accordance with AFMAN 91-201, Explosives
   Safety Standards and Department of Defense (DoD) 6055.9-STD, DoD Ammunition and
   Explosives Safety Standards Chapters 7, Paragraph C7.4.1.1.
6.8. Weather Advisories. A weather advisory is a special notice sent to customers whenever
mission-limiting, non-severe weather is expected to occur at WARB. The predefined weather
phenomenon may impact operations and is forecast to occur during the valid time of the
advisory. WARB weather advisory criteria can be found in Table 6.3.

Table 6.3. WARB Weather Advisory Criteria and Minimum DLTs.

  Criteria                                   DLT
  Wind > 25 KT but < 35 KT                   60 minutes
6.9. Weather Watch, Warning, and Advisory Dissemination. All weather watches,
warnings, and advisories are issued via JET and are numbered consecutively using five digits.
The first two digits indicate the month and the last three digits indicate the sequence number
(e.g., 04-003).
439AWI15-101 23 AUGUST 2013                                                                    27


   6.9.1. CP and the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) will receive and automated email
   message containing the watch, warning, and/or advisory to their organization’s email box.
   MOC will also receive a copy via JET.
   6.9.2. The TWR will receive the watch, warning, and/or advisory into their local ATC
   system, Airfield Automated System (AFAS), via the JET system.
   6.9.3. The WF will call CP, TWR, and MOC to verify receipt of all watches, warnings, and
   advisories.
   6.9.4. All watches, warnings, and advisories will be verbally passed on to Airfield
   Management Operations (AMOPS)/Airfield Management.
   6.9.5. Observed lightning warnings for “Lightning within 5 NM” are additionally
   disseminated verbally to Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD).
   6.9.6. Observed lightning warnings for “Lightning within 10 NM” are disseminated via JET
   but are ONLY called out by the WF for dissemination or verification of receipt to EOD and
   MOC.
   6.9.7. Certain weather warnings are disseminated by CP to the base “Giant Voice” system,
   in accordance with the Westover ARB Installation Emergency Management Plan 10-2, which
   allows all members on base to prepare for inclement weather.
   6.9.8. Weather watches, warnings, and advisories are disseminated by CP to the AtHoc
   system 24/7.
   6.9.9. Certain weather watches and warnings are disseminated by AMOPS via the Secondary
   Crash Network (SCN) per Westover ARB Installation Emergency Management Plan 10-2
   and local policy.
   6.9.10. Watches, warnings, and advisories will be called out by the WF in the following
   order:
       6.9.10.1. CP
       6.9.10.2. TWR
       6.9.10.3. MOC
       6.9.10.4. AMOPS
       6.9.10.5. EOD for Observed Lightning Warnings for within 5 NM and 10 NM ONLY
6.10. Upgrades/Downgrades. Advisories and warnings will be upgraded (e.g., forecast winds
increase from 35 knots to 50 knots) or downgraded as required. Upgrades should meet the
desired lead times specified in Tables 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3. Only one forecast warning may be in
effect at one time. If a warning is issued for one criteria and it becomes necessary to warn for
another criteria, a new warning with a new number will be issued to include all criteria expected.
A separate valid time may be specified for each criterion, if necessary.
6.11. Amendments/Extensions. Amendments/extensions to weather watches, warnings, and
advisories will only be issued to change the valid time and will be issued before the original
watch, warning, or advisory expires. New warnings and watches will be issued for any other
change in weather criteria.

6.12. Cancellations. Watches, warnings, and advisories may be cancelled when the weather
phenomena are no longer occurring or expected to occur. Cancellations will be disseminated in
the same manner described above in 6.9 for issuances. However, if the product is not cancelled,
it is assumed it will expire at the end of the valid period and additional notification will not
occur.
6.13. Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High Yield Explosive
(CBRNE). CBRNE operations lie with Emergency Management (EM), Fire Emergency
Services (FES), and Bioenvironmental Engineering (BEE). The WF will serve as the subject
matter expert (SME) for weather information needed to run CBRNE models.
   6.13.1. The WF will supply current weather information to EM, FES, and BEE to run plume
   models upon request.
   6.13.2. The WF will also provide forecast meteorological information and, as the weather
   SME, will determine which meteorological model data will best represent the current and
   forecast state of the atmosphere. The following lists the forecast products/information that
   can be provided by the WF to the CBRNE team upon request:
       6.13.2.1. Chemical Downwind Message (CDM). Used to predict the spread of
       chemical or biological agents after an incident or attack.
       6.13.2.2. Effective Downwind Message (EDM). Used to provide wind information in
       the prediction of areas affected by fallout following a nuclear attack.
       6.13.2.3. Basic Wind Message (BWM). Used to provide basic atmospheric information
       on wind, temperature, and pressure for a specific time and location surface to 30 KM.
       6.13.2.4. Other Meteorological Information.        Atmospheric information on wind,
       stability, temperature, humidity, weather, clouds, etc., can be provided by the WF upon
       request if information in CDMs, EDMs, or BWMs are inadequate, misrepresentative, or
       unavailable.
   6.13.3. During WF closure periods, CDM, EDM, and BWM forecast products can be
   provided by the 15 OWS. Contact the 15 OWS Senior Duty Officer at DSN 576-9698/9699
   or Comm (618) 256-9698/9699.
6.14. OPREP-3 Reporting. The WF will assist the 439 AW/CP with weather related OPREP-3
reports and provide the CP with all pertinent weather information as requested. The CP, in
turn, will provide the WF with a copy of any weather related OPREP-3 summary reports. The
WF will then forward this information to HQ AFRC/A3VA and the 15 OWS.
6.15. Tropical Cyclone Support. The WF monitors a Tropical Cyclone Threat Assessment
Product (TC-TAP) that is posted by the 15 OWS when a tropical system poses a threat to the 15
OWS AOR (i.e., the northeast CONUS).
   6.16.1. The WF CANNOT deviate from the 15 OWS TC-TAP forecast position, track,
   movement, maximum wind speed, or intensity. However, the WF can provide tailored
   weather forecasts for WARB based on the TC-TAP.
   6.16.2. The WF will ensure all customers understand that the 48-hour and 72-hour outlooks
   (or longer if issued) contain a high degree of uncertainty, are for planning purposes only, and
   are subject to change.

      will be sent.
      7.2.2.8. Initiate radio checks, when requested, to ensure proper PMSV operation.
      7.2.2.9. Notify WF Meteorological Technicians when observations and/or wind
      information are no longer being received.
      7.2.2.10. Notify WF Meteorological Technicians if elements in “automated”
      observations are missing or suspect due to possible equipment malfunction.
      7.2.2.11. Notify the WF when any of the weather conditions in Table 7.1 occur as part of
      the CWW program. The Meteorological Technician’s view from building 1610 is
      significantly obstructed by buildings south through southwest. Note: Upon receipt of
      this information, the Meteorological Technician will determine if augmentation is needed
      based on the AFMAN 15-111 and local policy. If augmentation is needed, the
      Meteorological Technician will determine if a SPECI will be generated or if conditions
      will be reflected in the next METAR.

Table 7.1. Cooperative Weather Watch Program.

 1.         A tornado, funnel cloud, or waterspout is observed or is reported by other non-
            weather personnel (e.g., pilots), especially to the south through southwest.
 2.         Lightning is observed, thunder is heard, or hail is falling, especially to the south
            through southwest.
 3.         The Tower’s prevailing visibility drops below 4 SM and differs by one or more
            reportable value.
 4.         When the Tower’s prevailing visibility “rapidly” increases or decreases when
            conditions are below 3 SM.
 5.         When the visibility rapidly drops to the south through southwest.
 6.         Any other meteorological condition that could have an immediate, significant impact
            on the airfield and/or aircraft operations.

7.3. 439 AW/CP will:
   7.3.1. Immediately relay changes in the flight MEF to aircrews when received from the WF.
      7.3.1.1. For critical MEF updates, they will pass on the current Operations Supervisor’s
      (OPSUP) contact information to the WF so they may speak with them directly.
   7.3.2. Immediately relay all mission status updates (i.e., maintenance delays, changes to
   departure times, changes to mission destinations, etc.) to the WF for all LOCAL and non-
   IFM missions. This will allow the WF to properly MISSIONWATCH the mission and
   determine if the MEF for the mission needs to be updated, especially when non-IFM
   missions are delayed or there are changes to destinations.
   7.3.3. Ensure the fastest dissemination of all weather watches, warnings, and advisories upon
   receipt in accordance with the Westover ARB Installation Emergency Management Plan 10-
   2.
439AWI15-101 23 AUGUST 2013                                                                    31


       7.3.3.1. CP has the primary responsibility for sounding the Emergency Notification
       System (Giant Voice) in the event of a tornado warning or other significant warnings
       (e.g., observed lightning warning, wind warning, etc.).
       7.3.3.2. CP has the primary responsibility for disseminating weather watches, warnings,
       and advisories via the AtHoc system for base-wide distribution 24/7.
   7.3.4. Request the assistance of the WF in providing required weather information to be
   included in any required OPREP-3 reports. Copies of any weather related OPREP-3 reports
   will be provided to the Weather Station Manager.
7.4. 439 AW/PA will:
   7.4.1. Act as a liaison for inquiries from the general public to include, but not limited to,
   news sources, lawyers, construction companies, local government agencies, and individuals
   not associated with any base agency or base contractor.
   7.4.2. Refer public requests to the servicing National Weather Service office at
   http://www.erh.noaa.gov/box/contact.shtml.
   7.4.3. Authorize any information that may be given to the general public by the WF. The
   WF will not pass on any current, forecast, or climatological information without going
   through PA.
7.5. 439 CS will:

7.6. 337 AS will:
   7.6.1. Notify the WF when current/planned mission specifics change in order for the WF to
   provide the most accurate information possible and/or to provide updates if necessary. A
   minimum of 30 minutes is required for preparation of an updated MEF.
   7.6.2. Provide post-mission feedback. The WF utilizes this data to refine their mission
   support role, gauge WF products strengths and weaknesses, and review forecasting
   techniques used.
   7.6.3. Advise the WF of any known future changes in general mission or support
   requirements (e.g., adding in new training requirements, changes to weather minimums
   whether permanent or temporary, etc.).
   7.6.4. Coordinate any changes to the format or issuance of MWPs or MEFs provided by the
   WF with the Weather Station Manager.
   7.6.5. Provide PIREPs directly to the WF via the PMSV, phone, TWR, or CP as frequently
   as possible.
   7.6.6. Coordinate any weather briefing support that would need to be provided by the WF
   outside the WF’s normal duty hours with the Weather Station Manager as soon as possible.
   7.6.7. Coordinate weather support for any special training activities, exercises, or events
   with the Weather Station Manager as far in advance as possible. Coordination of weather
   limitations and notification procedures may need to be established. The Weather Station
   Manager may also need to submit weather Support Assistance Requests (SAR) to appropriate
   agencies in advance for activities that take place away from WARB when it is not practical
   or possible for the WF to provide the support.
7.7. 439 MOS/MOCC. Will exercise ORM for lightning that may affect their operations when
the WARB WF is closed. MOC will be given access to AFW-WEBS’ lightning detection for use
outside of WF operating hours to assist in the ORM process.
439AWI15-101 23 AUGUST 2013                                                               33


   7.7.1. The 15 OWS at Scott AFB, IL will provide observed lightning warnings for within 5
   NM and 10 NM of WARB when the WF is closed. However, MOC will still need to
   exercise ORM when lightning is observed and/or thunder is heard as these “observed”
   warnings will be based on lightning detection systems ONLY. Lightning detection systems
   have limitations and do not detect all lightning strikes.
   7.7.2. During WF operating hours, WARB Meteorological Technicians will make the
   official determination on lightning that affects all WARB operations and, therefore, will
   determine if observed warnings for lightning within 5 NM and 10 NM will be issued or
   cancelled.
7.8. All Unit Agencies Receiving Weather Support will:
   7.8.1. Notify WF through proper chain of command when new weather support requirements
   are identified.
   7.8.2. Coordinate changes/additions to weather support requirements as soon as they are
   foreseen with the Weather Station Manager.

                      SPECIAL WEATHER OBSERVING CRITERIA

A2.1. General. SPECI surface weather observations will be taken and disseminated for the
criteria listed in this attachment. However, the ceiling, sky condition, visibility, and RVR criteria
listed below are subject to temporarily change if procedural NOTAMs have been issued for the
WARB airfield. Any changes that occur between updated publications of this regulation will be
published in the WARB Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW). Please see the CWW for current
SPECI criteria or contact the WF.
   A2.1.1. Ceiling SPECI Criteria.

Figure A2.1. Ceiling SPECI Criteria.
                               Ceiling SPECI Criteria:
              SPECI’s are generated when the ceiling forms or dissipates
              below, decreases to less than, or if below, increase to equal
                             or exceed the values listed.
                   200 FT                800 FT                2000 FT
                   300 FT                900 FT                3000 FT
                   500 FT               1000 FT
                   600 FT               1100 FT
                   700 FT               1500 FT
               Ceiling heights are measured and reported in feet above
                                  ground level (AGL)
   A2.1.2. Sky Condition. A layer of clouds (it does not have to be a ceiling) or obscuring
   phenomena aloft is observed below 1100 FT and no layer was reported below this height in
   the previous METAR or SPECI.
   A2.1.3. Visibility SPECI criteria:

Figure A2.2. Visibility SPECI criteria.
                              Visibility SPECI Criteria:
              SPECI’s are generated when visibility decreases to less than, if
                    below, increase to equal or exceed the values listed.
                     1/4 SM               1 1/4 SM              2 1/2 SM
                     1/2 SM              *(1 3/8 SM)              3 SM
                     3/4 SM               1 1/2 SM
                   *(7/8 SM)             *(1 5/8 SM)
                      1 SM                1 3/4 SM
                  *(1 1/8 SM)               2 SM
             * Values in parentheses are SPECI criteria for Westover ARB
             but are not reportable values in AMOS observations.
   A2.1.4. RVR SPECI criteria:

Figure A2.3. RVR SPECI Criteria.
                   Runway Visual Range (RVR) SPECI Criteria:
              SPECI’s are generated when the highest RVR value during the
                preceding 10 minutes decreases to less than or, if below,
40                                                         439AWI15-101 23 AUGUST 2013


                    increases to equal or exceed the values listed.
                 600 FT                 2000 FT               5500 FT
                 1000 FT                2400 FT               6000 FT
                 1200 FT                4000 FT
                 1600 FT                4500 FT
                 1800 FT                5000 FT
            When RVR is first determined as unavailable (RVRNO) for the
            runway in use, and when it is first determined that the RVRNO
              report is no longer applicable, provided conditions for the
                                 reporting RVR exist.
  A2.1.5. Tornado, funnel cloud, or waterspout. Is observed, disappears from sight or ends.
  A2.1.6. Thunderstorm (occurring at the station within 5 NM). Either begins or ends. Note: A
  thunderstorm is considered to have ended 15 minutes after the last occurrence within 5 NM
  of the aerodrome.
  A2.1.7. Thunderstorm in the vicinity (occurring within 5-10 NM of the station). Either
  begins or ends. Note: A thunderstorm is considered to have ended 15 minutes after the last
  occurrence within 5-10 NM of the aerodrome. This is local policy SPECI criteria due to the
  requirement of issuing observed lightning warnings for within 10 NM.
  A2.1.8. Precipitation.
     A2.1.8.1. Hail ( > 1/2 inch) begins or ends.
     A2.1.8.2. Freezing precipitation begins, ends, or changes intensity.
     A2.1.8.3. Any other type of precipitation that begins or ends. NOTE: Except for freezing
     rain, freezing drizzle, and hail, a SPECI observation is not required for changes in type
     (e.g., drizzle changing to snow) or the beginning or ending of one type while another is in
     progress (e.g., snow changing to rain).
  A2.1.9. Wind.
     A2.1.9.1. Shifts. A directional change of 45 degrees or more in less than 15 minutes
     with a wind speed of 10 KT or more throughout the wind shift.
     A2.1.9.2. Squall. A strong wind characterized by a sudden onset in which the wind
     speed increases at least 16 KT and is sustained at 22 KT or more for at least one minute.
  A2.1.10. Upon resumption of Observing Services. If “supplementing” or providing
  “back-up” to the AMOS, a SPECI observation will be taken within 15 minutes after the
  Meteorological Technician returns to duty following a break in observing coverage or
  augmentation at the unit unless a record observation if filed during that 15 minute period. If
  AMOS is functioning properly and is in “AUTO”, a SPECI observation is not required.
  A2.1.11. Volcanic Eruption. When eruption or a volcanic ash cloud is first noted.
  A2.1.12. Aircraft Mishap. ASPECI observation will be taken immediately following
  notification or sighting of an aircraft mishap at or near the observing location if augmenting
  the observations in back-up mode and/or supplementing observations for the mandatory or
  local policy supplementing criteria. A SPECI is not required if AMOS is functioning
  properly and is in “AUTO”.

  A2.1.13. Any other meteorological situation that in the Meteorological Technician’s opinion
  is critical to the mission or flight safety.
