6.9.5.1. (Added) OGV will maintain and provide to FS/CCV a “Failed Requisite Examination
Letter”, documenting dates/scores of failed requisite examinations and their successful re-
accomplishment. FS/CCV will ensure the examinee is placed on a supervised status. OGV will
track failed examinations and retests electronically (via PEX). FS/CCV will forward failed
examination info to OGV (i.e. when deployed) as soon as possible in the instance of a failed
requisite examination.
6.10.4. [31 FW] OGV will develop and CCVs will administer semi-annual tests. PEX is the
primary means of administering semi-annual testing. Hard copy testing is permissible in the
event PEX is not available. The tests should be administered near Jun and Dec, but timing may
vary depending on HHQ inspections and other inspections with testing requirements that qualify.
This program should evaluate a cross section of previously reported trends, general and tactical
knowledge, and may be administered open or closed book. Squadrons will ensure all examinees
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP 18 MARCH 2013                                                7


are debriefed on any incorrect answers, and failed exams are corrected to 100% (missed
questions will be documented for trend data). If the exam is administered via hard copy, CCVs
will forward trends from these tests to OGV. Semi-annual testing trends will be reported at the
SEB. Semi-annual testing will be documented via AF Form 1522, and tracked via ARMS.
FS/CCV will ensure all pilots (assigned and attached) take the semiannual test.

preferable over electronic (i.e. //SIGNED/initials//); however all are valid. Although not
required, every effort should be made to use only one signature format on each individual Form
8 for consistency.
7.3.2.7. (Added) SEFEs will document flight evaluation completion on a 31 OG/OGV flight
evaluation worksheet, 31 OG/OGV Emergency Procedures Evaluation Worksheet, and on a 31
OG/OGV TEMP FORM 8. FS/CCV will use the SEFE completed worksheet and 31 OG/OGV
TEMP FORM 8 to complete the official AF Form 8 utilizing PEX, and post the Temp Form 8
and accompanying worksheets above the section II cover sheet of the members FEF.
7.3.7.6. [31 FW] OGV and 31 OG/CC will review all officer AF Form 8s and document this
review on the reverse side of the AF Form 8 after the Form 8 has been routed and signed by the
examinee. OGV and 31 OG/CC will review the Form 8 prior to complete routing if the examinee
is no longer on station or if the Approving Officer is above 31 OG/CC. Only the initials will be
required for the additional reviewers.
7.3.8.6.1.1. (Added) Upon completion of the evaluation (flight and all requisites), FS/CCV
will file the completed 31 OG/OGV TEMP FORM 8 in the examinee's FEF along with the flight
and emergency procedures evaluation worksheets pending actual AF Form 8 posting. FS/CCV
must ensure the 31 OG/OGV Temp Form 8 is complete and adheres to all requirements of
paragraph 7.3.8 of this instruction prior to posting into members FEF.
7.3.8.7. (Added) FS/CCV will prepare and maintain all AF Forms 8 IAW AFI 11-202V2 and

7.8.1.2.1. (Added) FS/CCV will maintain FEFs on all assigned and attached squadron pilots.
Pilots who receive an evaluation at home station from the other squadron because their own
squadron is deployed will have their AF Form 8s processed by the FS/CCV at home station.
7.8.1.2.2. (Added) When one of the squadrons is deployed for more than 6 weeks, the
squadron at home station will physically maintain all 31 FW FEFs. In addition, the FS/CCV at
home station will be responsible for processing all AF Forms 8 (with inputs as required from the
TDY FS/CCV).
7.8.1.2.3. (Added) Wing leadership flies with both fighter squadrons on a rotating basis. Their
FEFs will be maintained, and evaluations tracked and processed by the squadron to which they
are attached to for flying. When wing leadership rotates, their FEFs will follow them. HHQ
personnel and other attached flyers’ FEFs will be maintained by the CCV of their assigned
squadron.

conjunction with CAPs are not considered Go/No-Go items. Reference paragraph 6.10.5
(Added).
9.3.3.1. (Added) Pilots that fail the monthly CAPs examination will be removed from the
flying schedule for the current day and will be required to accomplish and successfully pass
another examination prior to flying again.

                        LETTER OF CERTIFICATION GUIDANCE


A11.3.2. (Added)     Squadron Letter of Xs will be produced and maintained by FS/DOT.
A11.3.2.1.2.1. (Added) After SQ/CC (or SQ/DO in SQ/CC absence) signs the Master Letter of
Xs, SQ/DOT will finalize the electronic document to prevent further changes from being made.
In order to finalize the Letter of Xs, SQ/DOT will add the phrase "FOR REFERENCE ONLY"
and send an Adobe® .pdf copy of the document to OGV. OGV will post the document on
SharePoint. ® SQ/DOT will not distribute the Excel® file of the Letter of Xs. Any copies of the
signed Letter of Xs will be annotated with the phrase “FOR REFERENCE ONLY.” The intent
is for there to be only one Master Letter of Xs per squadron.
A11.3.2.1.3.1. (Added) After being finalized, the Master Letter of Xs (the signed original) will
be posted at the SQ Ops Desk. Pen & Ink updates can be made to the Master Letter of Xs by the
SQ/CC or SQ/DO IAW para A11.3.3. (Added - USAFE).
A11.4.1. (Added) The Letter of Xs will reflect the new certification level (If a SQ/CC
decertifies a Flight Lead down to wingman, the Letter of Xs will indicate that pilots new
certification level of wingman).
A11.5.1. (Added) When SQ/DOT replaces the Master Letter of Xs at the Ops Desk, the
previous months Master will be archived IAW paragraph A11.5. The intent is to archive the
document that may have been updated via pen & ink rather than archiving a document that was
only current as of the signature date. The method of archival is at the discretion of the squadron.

                             REAR COCKPIT EVALUATIONS

A15.1. RCP evaluations will be flown as a SPOT Evaluation and will be conducted IAW the
Rear Cockpit (RCP) Landing Qualification syllabus in Attachment 14 and AFI 11-202V2, AFI
11-2F-16V2 and associated supplements. Evaluations may be accomplished as a dedicated sortie
or during any mission with the examinee in the rear cockpit (an observe ride or sandbagging any
mission as long as training requirements are not diminished). An FE will occupy the front seat.
IAW paragraph 4.3.3.1. the 31 OG/CC waives the requirement for the FE to be current and
qualified in RCP landings. The FE will be current and qualified in landing.
A15.2. In order to maintain RCP qualifications, IPs will accomplish the RCP qualification as a
requisite for their INSTM/QUAL evaluation.
A15.3. The SPOT evaluation is a “flight phase” sortie and may influence the period evaluation
expiration date. For example, if the SPOT evaluation is flown after the INST/QUAL evaluation
flight, the expiration date of qualification will be based off the SPOT.
A15.4. The examinee will be given an FE coordination brief prior to flying the evaluation.
A15.5. If a SPOT evaluation is given as part of a requalification evaluation, the expiration date
of the SPOT Form 8 will be aligned with that of the current INST/QUAL evaluation.

                EMERGENCY PROCEDURES EVALUATION PROGRAM

A16.1. Purpose: The purpose of the Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE) program is to
evaluate emergencies, procedures, and tactical situations that cannot be safely evaluated in flight.
EPEs should be tailored to the examinee’s training and experience level. The purpose of the
EPE profiles in the 31 OG Viper Evaluation Guide is to provide SEFEs with a standardized
guide to administer EPEs. Profiles in the 31 OG Viper Evaluation Guide are intended to be used
as a guide and do not preclude SEFEs from administering alternate profiles.
A16.2. Reference: EPEs will be administered IAW AFI 11-202V2, USAFE and 31 FW
Supplements, AFI 11-2F-16V2, and the 31 OG Viper Evaluation Guide.
A16.3. Medium: The Unit Training Device (UTD) is the preferred medium for EPEs. EPEs
may be administered tabletop (verbal evaluation) if the UTD is not available. Squadron SEFEs
will be the primary evaluators for all EPEs. 31 OGV SEFEs may augment either squadron and
will normally give all rechecks. The general knowledge evaluation portion is not usually given
in conjunction with the flight evaluation and will be performed as part of the EPE.
A16.4. Requirements: All EPEs will include requirements listed in AFI 11-2F-16V2, and AFI
11-202V2 and USAFE Sup I.
A16.5. Grading: EPEs will be graded and recorded IAW AFI 11-202V2, USAFE and 31 OG
supplements, and AFI 11-2F-16V2. 31 OG/OGV Emergency Procedures Evaluation Worksheet,
should be used to assist in grading and evaluating the EPE. Examinees receiving an overall
unqualified grade (3) will not be permitted to fly until a successful recheck is accomplished.
SEFEs will complete the additional training letter (Attachment 19) if required, and will indicate
on the 31 OG/OGV Emergency Procedures Evaluation Worksheet if the additional training must
be completed prior to the flight evaluation.
A16.6. Profiles: EPE profiles are provided in the 31 OG Viper Evaluation Guide to aid and
standardize EPEs for the wing. The MSN EPE will involve a combat oriented scenario. Mission
materials for MSN EPE profiles are located at the UTD. NATO MSN EPE profiles should be
administered along with NATO MSN evaluations if a compatible simulator is available
(reference Attachment 17 for NATO MSN requirements). NATO specific Pre-MSN EPEs and
MEPEs should be annotated on the schedule to ensure the examinee is given the opportunity to
prepare for the evaluation (eg: PMEPE/N, MEPE/N). Pilots must be fully qualified (INT
complete) to be evaluated in this mission. Attached pilots and temporarily decertified pilots (“R”
on letter of Xs), may still be evaluated. Only fully qualified (INT complete) SEFEs may
administer a NATO MSN EPE

                         FLIGHT EVALUATION MANAGEMENT

A17.1. Scheduling: It is desirable for mission evaluations to be scheduled as 4-ships when
possible (CAS and NATO are the two exceptions) with the examinee flying in his most qualified
position. SEFEs will not administer more than one INSTM/QUAL evaluation on a single sortie.
Squadron CCV will monitor the scheduling process to ensure examinees are provided adequate
mission planning and debrief time. Strange field approach requests should be included on the
PVG two days prior to flight.
A17.2. Checkride Documentation Folder: CCVs will maintain a checkride folder to collect and
maintain requisite documents during the evaluation process. When the flight evaluation is
complete, the SEFE will fill in the flight evaluation information, sign, and date the 31 OG/OGV
Temp Form 8. When applicable, upon completion of the evaluation, CCVs will complete and
sign the AF Form 1522, and turn it in to the SARMs.
A17.3. Evaluation Administration: Examinees should contact the SEFE at least one day prior to
establish the exact requirements and profile. Instructors who are receiving recurring evaluations
will be evaluated on their ability to instruct in at least one area. This area will be the
instructional topic and will be emphasized throughout the flight. It is highly desirable for
instructors to instruct an actual upgrade ride (MQT) for the evaluation. Instructors receiving an
INSTM/QUAL evaluation will instruct on an INSTM/QUAL flying-related topic. The
remainder of the INSTM/QUAL mission may be briefed and flown as a CT type flight.
Examinees will fly in their most qualified position. Pit-and-Go evaluations should be completed
prior to the hot-pits, if all requirements were observed. However, both flights may be evaluated
at SEFE discretion. Pit-and-Go evaluations will be annotated as one sortie on the AF Form 8.
Fight-Tank-Fight evaluations should be completed after landing.
A17.4. INSTM/QUAL Evaluations: Evaluations for instrument/qualification will be flown as a
combined evaluation. INSTM/QUAL profiles will include as a minimum those areas defined by
AFI 11-2F-16V2, and should include at least one approach at a field other than home station
(preferably non-US), if possible. There are currently no DoD published PAR approaches in the
local area and will not be required due to lack of facilities. Document a failure to accomplish a
PAR on the AF Form 8 under "Additional Comments". The evaluation will be flown on a
tactical/RAP sortie when possible.
A17.5. MSN Evaluations: Pilots arriving who are not MR will receive an initial MSN
evaluation, which should be an air-to-surface PGM profile. All MSN checks should be
scheduled as "scenario-based missions" (i.e. SAT, CAS, DCA, etc). Suggested evaluation
profiles can be found in the 31 OG Viper Evaluation Guide.
A17.5.1. Air-to-Air Evaluations: Air-to-Air evaluations will include as a minimum those areas
defined by AFI 11-2F-16V2. Normally air-to-air mission evaluations should be scheduled as
DCA. For all profiles, the examinee will fly as an F-16, using F-16 weaponry and will not
execute bandit tactics. To call an Air-to-Air MSN check complete, an examinee must
successfully execute an air-to-air tactic and employ ordnance on a hostile aircraft.
A17.5.2. Air-to-Surface Evaluations: Air-to-Surface evaluations will include as a minimum
those areas defined by AFI 11-2F-16V2. If weapons employment evaluation is required IAW
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP 18 MARCH 2013                                                   21


AFI 11-2F-16V2, and air-to-surface weapons cannot be employed (either simulated or actual),
the evaluation is incomplete. Pilots and SEFEs should determine which target/profile they will be
fragged against. The flight examiner will then provide the examinee additional information to
aid mission planning.
A17.5.3. NATO MSN profiles: When NATO profiles are flown, both the MEPE and flight
should be NATO mission specific. Pilots must be fully qualified (INT complete) to be evaluated
in this mission. Attached pilots and temporarily decertified pilots (“R” on letter of Xs), may still
be evaluated. Only fully qualified (INT complete) SEFEs may administer a NATO MSN
evaluation. NATO missions should be flown using single-ship tactics with the SEFE in a chase
aircraft or in the rear seat of a D-model. NATO profiles may be administered no-notice.
A17.6. Instructor Evaluations: Pilots who are not previous F-16 instructor pilots require an
initial INSTR evaluation. Initial INSTR evaluations should be conducted by the OG/CC, FS/CC,
FS/DO, or an OGV SEFE. Initial instructor evaluations can be flown on any profile but should
be flown on an actual upgrade sortie when possible. Evaluation will be flown according to AFI
11-2F-16V1, 31 FW Supplement, and the 31 FW syllabus. These missions will be flown
primarily on MQT sorties with the instructor upgrade briefing and leading the flight. While no
specific evaluation requirements exist for INSTR evaluations, instructional ability will be
evaluated throughout the mission.
A17.7. An examinee’s SQ/CC, DO, and flight commander will be debriefed for any Q-2 or Q-3
evaluations and/or if the SEFE intervenes due to breaches in flight safety.
A17.8. Every attempt should be made to accomplish required areas during the actual flight. Six
month evaluation completion should be limited to flight evaluation “clean up items.” A verbal
examination is acceptable only if a reasonable number of attempts are accomplished to evaluate
required areas during actual flight.
