                           (_Shop Name Org/Office Symbol _) RESPIRATOR USE IN THE WORKPLACE
The objective of this Visual Aid is to provide workers, who are required to wear respirators, a conveniently located reference which details the
routine use of respiratory protection, fit-testing information, the tasks which require respiratory protection, cartridge change out as applicable, and
maintenance, cleaning, issuance, and storage procedures. Employee exposures to air contaminants will be eliminated or reduced to the lowest
level possible through the use of engineering controls, substitution of less or non-toxic products for those currently in use, and/or the use of
administrative controls. If these procedures are ineffective or impractical for reducing airborne contaminant levels below their Occupational
Exposure Limit, then respirators will be worn to ensure that no worker’s health is adversely affected.

1. Training. In accordance with AFOSH STD 48-137, training for respirator users must be conducted every 12 months. This training is
conducted in Bldg 3334 by the 72 AMDS/SGPB, Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight, prior to employee being fit-tested.

2. Fit-testing. Employees who wear tight-fitting respirators must be fit-tested every 12 months. The fit-testing is conducted by BEF in Bldg
3334 for employees who are medically qualified by the Occupational Medicine Flight. When reporting for fit-testing, employees must be clean-
shaven and must refrain from smoking for 30 minutes prior to the fit test. The fit-test room is open Monday-Friday, 0730-1100, 1200-1530 hours,
and is closed the third Wednesday of each month.

3. Routine Use/Emergency Situations.

3.1. Respirator wearers who use a tight-fitting mask must be clean-shaven every time the respirator is worn. Beard growth, including stubble, is
prohibited since the facial hair may interfere with the seal of the mask. Mustaches which end at the corner of the mouth and do not interfere with
the operation of the respirator are allowed.

3.2. You may not wear eyewear or head coverings such as hats or bandanas that interfere with the seal of the mask. If you require the use of
prescription eyewear, please contact Optometry to obtain prescription inserts.

3.3. For tight-fitting respirators , you must be refitted if you gain or lose more than 10% of your total body weight, have any facial or dental
surgery or any other condition that may affect the shape of your face. Any medical conditions that may affect your ability to wear a respirator
such as lung, heart, sinus or metabolic conditions must be reported to the Occupational Medicine Flight.

3.4. Prior to wearing your mask, you must inspect it for any defects in the face piece, lenses, straps, and valves. If you identify any defects
notify your supervisor or the person responsible for the maintenance of the respirator. Repair parts must be the exact replacement parts that are
recommended by the manufacturer. No modification of respirators will be conducted that may nullify the NIOSH certification (e.g., etching of
identifying numbers on any part of the respirator, mixing manufacturer replacement parts or using cartridges not approved by the
manufacturer).

3.5. If you wear an air-purifying respirator, ensure that the cartridges are the color specified in paragraph 4 of this TVA. The cartridges must be
from the same manufacturer as the mask and must be changed according to the frequency noted below.

3.6. If you wear an air-supplied mask, check the air pressure gauge to ensure that the supplied air meets the pressure requirements as stated in the
manufacturer’s instructions. If you use a cooling or heating vortex, check to ensure that your air supply is meeting the additional pressure
requirements. You should check the air pressure gauge each and every time you wear your air-supplied mask. Air line hoses shall be from the
same manufacturer as the respirator and may not exceed a length of 300 feet.

3.7. For tight-fitting respirators, perform negative and positive pressure checks to ensure that you have a good seal. These checks must be
accomplished every time you don your respirator.

3.8. If at any time you notice problems or an emergency arises while wearing your respirator, immediately leave the work area and report the
problem to your supervisor. This may include mask or equipment malfunction, strange smells, or sudden physical symptoms such as shortness of
breath or dizziness.

3.9. Ensure you inspect and clean your respirator after each use. Check with your supervisor to determine if the mask is to be turned in for
cleaning or if you are responsible for cleaning it yourself. See paragraph 5.3. of this TVA.

3.10. Store your respirator in a clean, dry area when not in use, including short breaks and lunch periods. Do not store equipment or other
material on top of the respirator as this may cause distortion or breakage of the mask. See paragraph 5.4. of this TVA for the storage location.

4. Tasks Requiring Respiratory Protection. It is essential that employees use the correct respirator for the operations being conducted. The
following chart identifies which specific tasks require the use of respirators in this work area, the correct respirator assembly, color of cartridges
and the cartridge change out schedule.
