                                                     PREFACE

 Note: Effective 1 October 1997 all Army loads will require an inspection by a qualified Sling Load Inspector.
 See Appendix I.



    This manual is one of a series of manuals for aviation and ground personnel who perform helicopter sling load
 missions ashore or aboard ship. Other manuals in this series are FM 55-450-4/FMFRP 5-31, VOL II/NWP 42-
 1,VOL II/AFR 50-16, VOL II/COMDTINST M13482.3 and FM 55-450-5/FMFRP 5-31, VOL III/NWP 42-1,VOL
 III/AFR 50-16, VOL III/COMDTINST M13482.4.

   These manuals are a coordinated effort of the US Army, US Marine Corps, US Navy, US Air Force, and US
 Coast Guard. All services participate in the sling load certification program begun by the Army in 1984. These
 manuals include standardized rigging procedures and other information from that program.

    Efforts were made to standardize ground crew and hookup procedures and terminology. The terms "helicop-
 ter" and "aircraft" refer to vertical lift aircraft that participate in sling load operations. Where service-unique
 requirements apply to an entire chapter or body of text, the service initials are at the beginning of the chapter or
 text. Otherwise the initials are at the end of the applicable sentence.

    The information in this manual will familiarize personnel with the sling sets, cargo nets, and other sling load
 equipment in the DOD inventory. It will also acquaint them with the helicopters used for sling load and provide
 basic procedures for rigging and hooking up loads. Rigging equipment and procedures described in this manual
 may not be authorized for all aircraft or services because of equipment or service restrictions. This manual does
 not provide details on aviation operations nor does it present detailed data that is normally contained in unit
 standing operating procedures (SOPs).

  h. Emergency Lighting. During an emergency, vari-
ous lighting patterns can be used with proper coordina-
tion between the aircrew and ground personnel. A com-
mon method using vehicles is shown in Figure 4-14. This
method should only be used in an emergency because it
impairs the pilot’s night vision and can disclose the land-
ing site position. Refer to the NWP-55-9-ASH for other
variations of night landing patterns (USMC).

gested areas and provides optimum safety. Avoid areas
of dust, mud, snow, or ice.

  b. Surface Conditions. Grassy fields, edges of run-
ways, ramps, or paved roads normally provide good sur-
face for sling load operations. Once the commander has
designated the areas to be used, ground crew personnel
clear the landing site and set up markings to identify the
area from the air. When the situation permits, they co-
ordinate with the pilot to determine which way the heli-
copter will go in an emergency.

  c. Cargo Preparation. Before the operation starts,
the ground crew must make sure that the cargo has been
correctly prepared, rigged, and inspected for sling load-
ing. If vehicles or equipment are not prepared properly,
they could be damaged when lifted by the helicopter.
Loads should be pre-positioned to expedite hookup.

  d. Static Wand. The static wand person drives the
grounding rod into the ground on the side of the load
opposite the rendezvous point/exit path. See Chapter 3
for detailed instructions concerning the grounding rod
and static discharge wand.
                                                                     Figure 5-2. Ground Crew Initial Position
  e. Positioning Personnel (Army). As the helicopter
approaches the landing site, the ground crew personnel
put on their equipment and take up their positions. The
signalman positions himself at the aircraft’s 12 o’clock
position, upwind of the load, facing the load and the
aircraft (Figure 5-2). The USMC outside director is re-
ferred to as a signalman.

  f. Positioning Personnel (USMC). Marine Corps
HST operations require different positions for the HST
personnel (Figure 5-3). As the helicopter approaches
the landing site, the outside director is at a position of 2

he is able to guide the helicopter over the load with

Any extra personnel, such as equipment operators, will
be positioned so that they are clear of the hookup area
and away from the approach and exit paths. No person-
nel should be positioned on the ground in the approach
path between the load and the aircraft.

  h. Hookup Team Procedures. Hookup team person-
nel should kneel down, brace themselves, and hold se-
curely to the load because of the rotor wash. The hookup
man will have the apex fitting/web ring in his hands ready
for hookup. The static wand person will hold the static

 a. Dual-point Procedures. Dual-point load rigging
procedures may be different from single-point rigging
procedures, When possible, coordinate with the aircrew
before attempting a dual-point hookup. Either cargo hook
can be connected first. Do not mistakenly connect one
of the slings to the center cargo hook.

  b. Aircraft Position. The hookup teams must con-
stantly be aware of the position of the aircraft and cargo
hook. It is difficult for the aircrew member to watch
both hookup teams as the aircraft hovers over the load.
The pendant system on the H-53E (Figure 5-8) enhances
hookup team safety by increasing load separation.

                      WARNING

Use extreme caution when attaching the apex
fitting to the cargo hook during a dual-point
hookup. The aircraft must hover close to the
load which could cause the aircraft to strike
the load or personnel. Special care must be
taken when connecting the aft hook. The rear
of the aircraft has a tendency to dip down if
the pilot has to move to the rear.

    (1) The overall capacity of the sling set changes as
we add or subtract sling legs. If you add legs to a sling
set, the capacity of the clevis does not change. There-
fore, a six-legged 10,000-pound capacity sling set will
still safely carry only 10,000 pounds. If one leg is re-
moved, the 10,000-pound capacity set will be able to
carry only 7,500 pounds while the 25,000-pound capac-
ity sling set can carry 18,750 pounds.

                WARNING
Each of the four legs of the 10,000- and
25,000-pound capacity sling sets will carry
only one-fourth of the overall capacity of the
set.
   (2) You may rig a load such as a fuel drum that has
only two lift points. In this case, run two chains through
each hookup point. This will allow the full capacity of
the sling to be used. If the load is less than half the
capacity of the sling set, you can use just two sling legs,
one leg to each hookup point as shown in Figure 6-9.

    (3) You may also use this method when hooking up
a load with only three lift points (Figure 6-10). Route
the extra chain leg through one of the hookup points and
use the same chain link number. You will be less likely         Figure 6-9. Load with Two Lift Points
to lose the fourth sling leg, and the sling set will be ready
for another load.

   (4) Some loads use six lift provisions. Figure 6-11
shows that the apex fitting was disassembled and two
additional legs were added.

   (5) Remember, this sling set can still only transport
10,000 pounds of cargo. Even though the six sling legs
could carry 15,000 pounds, the apex fitting can only carry
10,000 pounds.

    (6) Some loads can be carried in the dual-point con-
figuration. Dual-point loads require an additional apex
fitting for the extra sling set (Figure 6-12).

7-1. INTRODUCTION

This chapter covers the flat-web nylon cargo net, along
with the 5,000- and 10,000-pound capacity knotless ny-
lon cord cargo nets. These nets are used to carry sup-
plies, equipment, and loose cargo. The characteristics
of each net are discussed in detail.

7-2. FLAT-WEB NYLON CARGO NET

The flat-web nylon cargo net was designed to carry loose
cargo when loading or offloading ships. It was not de-
signed nor tested for helicopter sling loading, although
it is commonly used during sling load operations. The
net weighs 50 pounds and has a flat surface area mea-
suring 14 feet x 14 feet. The mesh size is 8 inches square.
A 10 foot x 10 foot and 12 foot x 12 foot net are also
available. The rated capacity of the net is 2,500 pounds                  Figure 7-1. Flat-Web Nylon Cargo Net
(Figure 7-1), downgraded from 4,500 pounds due to an
increased safety margin. The net has four steel hoist              fourths of the height on all sides of a single item or the
links with one link attached to each corner of the net. A          entire height of a mixed load.
7-foot loop of nylon rope may be attached to each link
to help the riggers spread out the net. Refer to Chapter 9           • Tie the net around the top of the cargo with nylon

items from failing out of the net (weave and tie).

Follow these instructions when rigging the net:

   (1) Spread the net out on the ground. Have four
persons pull evenly on each of the four lifting legs to
open the net to its fullest extension over the spot where
the net is to be loaded (Figure 7-5). This will prevent
the net from shifting under the pallets or load when the
helicopter lifts the net.

   (2) Inspect the net. Repair as necessary. Inspect the
pallet or load and make sure that the banding material
and pallet frame will not puncture, cut, or tear the net.                   Figure 7-6. Aligned Load

   (8) After you finish taping the legs and net on top of
the load, pull the net outward at each corner, grasp the
border cord from each side near the corner of the load,
and tape them together to tighten the sides of the net.
Take the excess netting at the corner and tape to the
adjoining side. At each side, pull the net up as high as
possible and tape it to itself to prevent it from snagging
on the load and tearing the net (Figure 7-11). Use only
enough tape to hold the net in place on the load. DO
NOT tape the net to the load.

the load must be moved after it is rigged, carefully guide
the forklift forks through the net and into the pallet slots.

            Figure 8-4. Securing the Strap

Pull the lower lateral straps to the corners of the load.
Route the free end under the floating bar and back over
the friction adapter. Attempt to tighten all four lower
lateral straps equally. Repeat this step using the middle
lateral straps. Fasten the upper lateral straps in the same
manner as in Figure 8-5. If the load is not high enough
for the upper lateral straps to go around the side of the
load, pull the suspension webs to their full height and
fasten the upper straps diagonally across the top corner
of the load. Strap fasteners should be tightened to within
4 to 5 inches of the upper lifting legs.

snap fasteners on the 24-inch suspension web straps to

8-4. REACH PENDANTS

A reach pendant is a synthetic rope assembly with an
attached stiffened reach tube and a loop on each end.
The built-in reach tube enables the hookup man to place
the pendant’s top eye on the helicopter cargo hook while
the helicopter hovers at a higher distance over the load.
There are two authorized reach pendants for use on sling         BOTTOM LOOP
loads, the 11,000-pound capacity Reach Pendant (11-
K), the 25,000-pound capacity Reach Pendant (25-K).

  c. Nylon Cord. Type III nylon cord has a breaking
strength of 550 pounds. Because of its high breaking
strength, nylon cord is not used in situations that require
the breakaway technique. Nylon cord is used to secure
loose equipment, padding, and excess chain.

  d. Protective Padding. To prevent chafing damage
to equipment during sling load operations, any chain end
of a sling connected to or resting against the lightweight
metal surface of a piece of equipment should be wrap-
ped with padding to prevent damage. The padding is
also wrapped around the nylon portion of the sling legs
and taped or tied to protect the legs from sharp objects
which could damage the sling legs or cause fusing or
melting of the nylon due to friction. The padding may             Figure 8-15. Large Clevis Assembly (Part No.

a strong, steady relative wind is ideal for VERTREP.

  c. Helicopter Fuel Loading. A full load of fuel adds
substantial weight to the helicopter and reduces the
amount of cargo that can be lifted. As the fuel is used,
more cargo can be lifted. The amount of cargo to be
transferred, distance to be flown, and wind and weather
conditions are some of the factors to be considered in
determining the fuel load.

9-5. VERTICAL REPLENISHMENT EQUIPMENT

Certain cargo-handling, load-carrying, and auxiliary
equipment is needed for VERTREP. Some items have
been used for alongside replenishment or cargo handling
for a number of years. A few have been designed spe-
cifically for VERTREP. The VERTREP equipment is
generally different from other equipment used to sling
load cargo and equipment (Chapters 6, 7, and 8).             Figure 9-2. Hoisting Sling Hooked to Cargotainer

                                                          that a lightweight load may be blown against the bottom
                                                          of the helicopter.

                                                            c. Cargo Net Loading (Loose Cargo). Use nets for

                                                          when loading cargo nets:

                                                             (1) Avoid lightweight (less than 100 pounds) loads
                                                          because of their instability during flight.
                                                              (2) Do not load small cartons on the bottom of the
                                                          net where they could be forced out through the openings
                                                          in the net.

                                                             (3) Cover or secure lightweight or small items to-
                                                          gether to keep them from blowing out of the net. Once
                                                          they are packed together, place them on top of the larger
                                                          loads.

                                                          the items from being lost through the net.

                                                             (1) Band or strap cargo securely to the pallet.

                                                             (2) Lay the cargo net out on the deck and place the
                                                          loaded pallet in the center.

aircraft’s hook must be maintained continuously until
hookup is complete. Static electricity is dangerous and
can cause serious injury or death.
