SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.
1.1.3. Publications/Forms Processing. The AF Form 673 has been revised; use the newest
version, 11 February 2013, on e-publishing for processing new and revised forms and
publication actions.
2.14. Publications/Forms Manager. 88 CS/SCOKI serves as the Base-level Publication
Manager to administer the organization’s official publications and forms program. 88
CS/SCOKI is also designated as the Base focal point for all publications and forms to include
 2                           AFI33-360_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP 27 MARCH 2013


AFTO (Air Force Technical Order) forms, AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual, supplements,
and JGDM (Joint Group Depot Maintenance) forms. All Command (AFMC) publications,
including (Instructions, Supplements, Manuals, etc.), and AFMC forms are now processed
through Air Force Network Integration Center (AFNIC).
5.4.2. Periodic Required Review (every 4 years). 88 CS/SCOKIP will initiate a review for
their publications and forms annually using the (new) AF Form 399. If the OPR has provided the
publication/form status on AF Form 673 within the past year, the review will be postponed until
the next year. NOTE: Both the OPR and the certifying official identified in the publication
must sign the AF Form 399 during the annual or special review.
5.4.4.3. When an OPR has a supplement to a higher level publication, and a revision is made to
the higher level publication, the OPR has 180 days to revise their supplement (either by an
interim change or a rewrite), by completing the special review (AF Form 399) tasked by the
Publications Manager.
5.7. Transfer of Responsibility/Ownership of a Publication. All OPRs shall follow the
criteria explained in AFI33-360, para 5.7., when leaving the organization or transferring the
publication to another organizational function.
5.8.1. OPRs submitting an AF Form 673 to rescind a publication shall ensure all interested or
affected functions are aware of the rescinded publication. If there are any forms that were
prescribed in the publication being rescinded, the OPR must also coordinate with the form’s
OPR to either have the form obsoleted or prescribed in another publication.
6.5. Constructing the Draft. Review all criteria in the AFI 33-360, para 6.5., for the layout and
construction of your new or revised publications.
6.5.1. OPRs shall format their draft publications and insert “DRAFT—NOT FOR
IMPLEMENTATION OR COMPLIANCE” across the top of each page, while circulating for
coordination/approval. This prevents anyone from complying with suggested guidance until
actually approved. Once the draft publication is submitted to the base publishing office, signed
and approved, the notice will be removed.
6.5.4. Create your draft using Word® in 12-point, Times New Roman font, flush left, and single
line spacing. Do not use page numbers, tabs, paragraph indents, bullets, auto numbering, etc.
The correct formatting will be applied once the publication is tagged at Air Force Departmental
Publishing Office (AFDPO).
6.5.6. Follow AFI 33-360, para 6.5.6., to ensure you include all concise purpose statements for
the categories of your opening paragraph.
6.8.4. All Guidance Memorandums (GMs), now become void after one-year has elapsed from
the date of the memorandum, or upon publication of an Interim Change or rewrite of the affected
publication, whichever is earlier. This has changed from the previous 180-day timeframe.
7.2.2. Mandatory Coordination. All functional/technical coordinations shall be completed
before obtaining the mandatory coordinations. Coordinations can be obtained by digitally
signing the AF Form 673, email concurrences, e-SSS, etc., attached to the AF 673 or added to
the email attachment when submitting the publication for final processing.
7.2.2.1. (Added) There are three mandatory Base-level publication coordinations: 88
CS/SCOKI (Records), 88 CS/SCOKIP (Privacy Act), and 88 ABW/JA organizational email

account. 88 ABW/JA must be the last stop for coordination so they can review all previous
comments/concerns before signing off on the document. It will not be accepted out of this order.
12.6.7. (Added) Use discretion when using the word “Report” as part of the title of the form.
The word “Report” is normally associated with a Reports Control Symbol (RCS). If a RCS is
required, then contact the local reports control manager who will determine if an RCS is
applicable to the form during the design phase.
