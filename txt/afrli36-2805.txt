SUMMARY OF CHANGES

The Military Quarterly/Annual Awards Monitor (AFRL/DPMD) will now administer the AFRL
Military Quarterly/Annual Awards Program. The title of AFRLI 36-2805 changed from
Airman/NCO/Senior NCO/CGO/FGO of the Quarter/Annual Awards Program to AFRL Military
Quarterly/Annual Awards Program. Paragraph 4.1.3 reflects requirements of completion of their
Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) Degree and Senior Noncommissioned Officer
Academy (SNCOA). Team Wright-Patterson Quarterly/Annual Award winners of the AFRL-
wide quarterly awards will automatically roll up to compete at the Team Wright-Patterson
Quarterly/Annual Awards, if they are located at Wright-Patterson AFB (WPAFB). If the winner
is not located at WPAFB, the next runner-up in that category, who is located at WPAFB, will be
the Team Wright-Patterson nominee. Members assigned to other detachments may compete for
their host base team awards if available. AFRL IMA annual award winner for each respective
category will be determined through a records-only board process. This publication has been
substantially revised and must be reviewed in its entirety.
