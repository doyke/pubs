This instruction supplements AFI 91-202, US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, dated
1 Aug 1998, and ACC Supplement 1 to AFI 91-202, dated 5 Oct 01. The purpose of this

Video Teleconference (VTC) date and time, groups will schedule personnel to attend the

recommended to rotate the personnel who attend these VTCs. In addition to an O-6, Chief, and
the Chief of Safety, the attendance breakdown will be as follows:

     - FTAC – 10 slots, if unable to attend, notify the wing safety office so the seats can be
       redistributed.
     - MXG – 6 slots, 2 each for MXS and AMXS and 1 each for MOS and MUNS.
     - MSG – 6 slots, 1 each for SVS, SFS, LRS, CE, CS; MSS/BW and CONS will be

using locally developed checklists located on the Wing Safety intranet page and pertinent
AFOSH Standards.

A9.2.1.9. (Added): USRs will conduct at least one 30 minute seatbelt check per month

annual inspection or one to two months prior to the unit’s scheduled annual inspection.

A9.2.2.9.1. (Added): USRs will ensure ground mishaps are reported to Wing Safety via the 28
BW Mishap Data Worksheet within 5 duty days from the date of mishap. Contact Wing Safety
as soon as possible for serious injuries resulting in hospitalization or quarters. Wing Safety can
be contacted after duty hours through the Command Post. The supervisors will complete the 28
BW Mishap Data Worksheet and ensure adequate preventive actions are taken to prevent
recurrence. The 28 BW Mishap Data Worksheet will be routed through the unit commander to
28 BW/SEG.
