RAMSTEINABI15-101 6 NOVEMBER 2013                                                           3


  1.3. Assumptions. Weather communications networks will function continually and
  without interruption to provide sufficient data for continuity of weather operations during
  peacetime. Loss of communication will cause significant degradation of quantity and quality
  of weather services.
  1.4. Limitations. 86 OSS/OSW support to 86 AW is limited as follows:
     1.4.1. The 86 OSS/OSW is responsible for ASF, MIF, and SIF functions to 86 AW at
     RAB, Germany. When able, 86 OSS/OSW will direct inquiries for the aforementioned
     functions to the appropriate supporting weather unit IAW AFI15-128 and AFMAN 15-
     129V2. The 521st Air Mobility Operations Wing (AMOW) and 435th Air Ground
     Operations Wing (AGOW) are tenant wings utilizing Ramstein airfield and base
     facilities; however, they will be predominantly supported by 618 AOC (TACC)/XOW,
     435AMS/OPSF, respectively and the 21 OWS. Exceptions will be listed in the following
     sections.
  1.5. Roles and Responsibilities. Coordination on this instruction constitutes acceptance in
  lieu of a memorandum or Letter of Agreement unless one is required by AFI or AFMAN.
     1.5.1. 86 OSS/OSW provides world-class weather support for the execution of 86 AW
     and partner missions anytime, anywhere. OSW remains prepared to support EUCOM
     and 86 AW peacetime and wartime taskings with dedicated equipment and personnel.
         1.5.1.1. 86 OSS/OSW Flt/CC ensures overall operational capability of the flight by
         providing intent, direction and resources in alignment with 86 AW priorities. The
         Flt/CC is responsible for the conduct and direction of the 86 OSS/OSW.
         1.5.1.2. 86 OSS/OSW Wing Weather Officer (WWO) exploits and makes weather a
         force multiplier by providing liaison and briefing services to all 86 AW agencies.
         1.5.1.3. 86 OSS/OSW Flt Chief provides technical leadership and oversees daily
         weather operations ISO base and flying operations. The Flt Chief adapts resources to
         mission requirements and manages weather services and equipment. Lastly, this
         individual is responsible for all training and readiness activities and the technical
         health of the forecast unit.
     1.5.2. 424 ABS and the associated airfield located at Chièvres AB are not manned with
     AF weather personnel. ASF services are provided by Belgian Air Component Weather
     Station, Chièvres AB (MET EBCV). FWBs are provided by 21 OWS FWB Section at
     Kapaun Air Station (AS), Germany (21 OWS/FWB), per AFI 15-128 and AFMAN 15-
     129V1. Services provided by 86 OSS/OSW are outlined in 3.8.
     1.5.3. 21 OWS provides synoptic-scale analysis and forecast products, resource
     protection, TAFs, METWATCH, and 603 AOC/AMD/IFM tasked FWBs for EUCOM
     and US Africa Command (AFRICOM) AORs. 21 OWS provides all weather products to
     USAFE WFs as required by relevant AFMANs and installation datasheets. Specific
     weather requirements are outlined and coordinated with 21 OWS as needed. 21 OWS
     ensures the weather support is available 24 hours per day, seven days a week. NOTE: 21
     OWS does not provide MEFs or provide embedded forecasters within the flying units
     attached to 86 AW, as they are not manned to do either task.

       1.5.4. The 618 AOC (TACC)/XOW provides weather services to the 618 AOC (TACC)
       to include MEFs for United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM)-tasked
       missions.
       1.5.5. Non-86 AW transient aircrew briefings will be provided upon request by the 86
       OSS/OSW as time and resources allow IAW posted 86 OSS/OSW duty priorities
       (Attachment 2). Otherwise, aircrew briefings will be provided through the 21 OWS. A
       minimum of two hours’ notice is required for a briefing request.
    1.6. Release of Weather Information. 86 OSS/OSW does not provide weather support or
    information to non-DoD organizations or to the general public except as authorized by AFI,
    Joint Ethics Regulation (5500.7-R) or the 86 AW/CC (or designated representative). In
    addition, 86 OSS/OSW personnel will not release weather data to outside agencies unless
    coordinated through 86 AW Public Affairs (PA).
    1.7. Operating Hours, Location, and Contact Information.
       1.7.1. Airfield Services Function (ASF).
           1.7.1.1. Operating Hours. The Airfield Services Functions operates 0600L to
           2200L Monday through Friday and 1000L to 2200L on German holidays. The
           Airfield Services Function is closed on USAFE family and 86 AW goal days or down
           days and US Federal holidays when local training flights are not scheduled. When
           the weather technician on duty is performing the MIF in addition to the ASF, closing
           hours will adjust accordingly if the recovery time of the last local training mission
           extends past 2200L.
           1.7.1.2. Location. The Airfield Services Function is located in Room 601, 6th floor
           of Building 2303 (Tower). The AOL is located on the 2nd floor of Building 2372.
           1.7.1.3. Contact Information. For general weather inquiries, and FWBs, during
           operating hours contact ASF, DSN: 480-2488, or via email at 86weather@us.af.mil
           (86 OSS/OSW in the GAL). Outside of operating hours, contact the 21 OWS
           Ramstein forecaster DSN: 489-2134, or the 21 OWS/FWB, DSN: 489-2133. For 86
           AW contingencies, exercises, emergencies, or severe weather events (i.e. SWAP
           initiation) requiring weather support outside of operating hours, contact the 86
           OSS/OSW standby technician via the on-call cell phone at 0170-786-6997 or the 86
           OSS/OSW Flt/CC at 0151-2778-4699.
       1.7.2. Mission Integration Function (MIF).
           1.7.2.1. Operating Hours. The MIF will tailor operating hours to accommodate
           local training flight mission requirements. As a general rule, the MIF will be on duty
           during local training mission launch and recovery times and not during DoD FLIP
           RAB quiet hours. The MIF shift is normally an 8-hour window that begins in the
           morning, depending upon local training mission times. Training missions that extend
           into late afternoon or early evening hours will be covered by the ASF as necessary.
           The MIF is closed on USAFE family and 86 AW goal days or down days and US
           Federal holidays when local training flights are not scheduled.
           1.7.2.2. Location. When manning allows, the MIF (embedded briefer) will be
           located in the 37 AS Mission Planning room in Building 2192. The MIF may also

        perform duties from the 6th floor of Building 2303 (Tower), Room 601 as required
        (e.g. all 37 AS missions have already taken off, etc.). Outside of MIF operating
        hours, the MIF and ASF are performed by one forecaster in Room 601, 6th floor of
        Building 2303 (Tower). Reference paragraph 1.7.1.2 for AOL information. At this
        time, the 76th AS has not requested an embedded forecaster.
        1.7.2.3. Contact Information. During MIF operating hours, contact the MIF at
        DSN: 480-7780. Reference paragraph 1.7.1.3. for additional contact information
        outside of MIF operating hours, or when the briefer is not in the 37 AS Building
        2291.
     1.7.3. Staff Integration Function (SIF).
        1.7.3.1. Operating Hours. The SIF operates 0730L to 1630L Monday through
        Friday and is closed on USAFE family and 86 AW goal days or down days and US
        Federal holidays.
        1.7.3.2. Location. The SIF is located in on the 2nd floor of Building 2303 (Tower).
        Reference paragraph 1.7.1.2 for AOL information.
        1.7.3.3. Contact Information. During operating hours, contact the SIF at DSN:
        480-2185. Reference paragraph 1.7.1.3 for additional information.
     1.7.4. Operating Hours During 86 AW Contingencies and Exercises. All 86
     OSS/OSW elements will alter operating hours to meet mission requirements during 86
     AW contingencies and exercises.
  1.8. Duty Priorities. 86 OSS/OSW completes daily tasks IAW the duty priorities list in
  Attachment 2.
  1.9. Airfield Support Function (ASF).
     1.9.1. “Eyes Forward”. The ASF functions as the “eyes forward” for the 21 OWS and
     keeps the 21 OWS Ramstein forecaster informed on changing environmental conditions
     for TAF production and amendment, weather WWAs, and general meteorological
     situational awareness. The ASF will notify the 21 OWS forecaster of all operationally
     significant PIREPs received from aircraft arriving to or departing from RAB. The “eyes
     forward” function yields meaningful meteorological information not contained in coded
     observations to the 21 OWS and is an integral part of the METWATCH process for RAB.
     1.9.2. Observations.
        1.9.2.1. Observations are issued for RAB under the ICAO identifier ETAR, 24 hours
        a day, seven days a week. Routine “METAR” observations are issued every hour
        between 55 and 59 minutes past the hour. Special “SPECI” observations are issued
        whenever weather conditions cross RAB airfield specification criteria thresholds.
        These criteria are based on AFMAN 15-111 SPECI Criteria, AFMAN 15-129V1
        standard specification and amendment criteria, and FLIP takeoff and landing minima
        for RAB. A complete list of specification and amendment criteria for RAB can be
        found in the Ramstein (ETAR) Installation Datasheet, under the “SPECI Criteria” and
        “TAF Criteria” tabs.

    1.9.2.2. RAB utilizes the AMOS, FMQ-19 “Fixed Based System” as the primary
    means of gathering real-time weather data on the Ramstein airfield complex. The
    AMOS is an integrated system of multiple weather sensors that continually measures
    environmental weather conditions to provide responsive, reliable, real-time weather
    information ISO flight operations. The 86 OSS/OSW utilizes the AMOS to take and
    disseminate automated observations IAW AFMAN 15-111. AMOS equipment and
    sensors are installed on runway 08, runway 09, runway 26, runway 27, and at the
    runway complex midfield. A certified observer maintains weather situational
    awareness and is available to augment AMOS observations during standard operating
    hours or upon recall during off-duty hours in the event that the AMOS system is
    malfunctioning.
    1.9.2.3. 86 OSS/OSW will perform one of two types of weather watch: a Basic
    Weather Watch (BWW) or a Continuous Weather Watch (CWW) IAW AFMAN 15-
    111. At RAB, the FMQ-19 observing system performs an automatic CWW. During
    back-up or supplemental augmentation of the AMOS, the ASF technician will
    perform a BWW unless required by environmental conditions outlined in AFMAN
    15-111.
    1.9.2.4. Augmentation
       1.9.2.4.1. Augmentation is the process of having position qualified weather
       technicians manually add or edit data to an observation generated by a properly
       sited automated observing system. Certain weather phenomenon’s are beyond the
       detection and reporting capabilities of the FMQ-19 system. Supplementary
       augmentation is the method of manually adding meteorological information to an
       automated observation that is beyond the capabilities of the FMQ-19 and will be
       conducted during operating hours. At all times (during both operating and non-
       operating hours), 86 OSS/OSW personnel will respond to SWAP procedures (see
       paragraph 1.12) and supplement mandatory criteria as required.
       1.9.2.4.2. Augmented meteorological elements will be determined from the
       primary official point of observation (elevation 817 ft above MSL) on the roof of
       the 4th floor on the east and west side of Building 2303. When 86 OSS/OSW is
       conducting operations from the AOL (Building 2372), augmented meteorological
       elements will be determined from the alternate official point of observation
       (elevation 779 feet above MSL) just to the southwest of Building 2372.
       1.9.2.4.3. RAB Specific Supplementation Criteria
RAMSTEINABI15-101 6 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                  7


Table 1. Mandatory Supplementary Weather Conditions Criteria (per AFMAN 15-111,
amended for RAB):
Body of Report
Tornado (+FC) (NOTE 1) (NOTE 2)
Funnel Cloud (FC) (NOTE 1) (NOTE 2)
Waterspout (+FC) (NOTE 1) (NOTE 2)
Hail (GR) (Only when size is greater than ¼ inch IAW local warning criteria)
Volcanic Ash (VA)
Ice Pellets (IP)
Remarks Section of Report
Snow Depth (only during airfield operating hours and if heavy snow warning has been issued and
snowfall is occurring)
NOTES:
1. The immediate reporting of funnel clouds takes precedence over any other phenomena.
2. ASF technician will log on to AMOS and be prepared to supplement for tornadic activity any
time a weather watch or warning has been issued for the phenomena.
               1.9.2.4.4. NOTE: Under previous AFMAN 15-111 guidance, a risk assessment
               for the supplementation of prevailing visibility was conducted by 86 AW/SE in
               2008 and is available to reference upon request. As current AFMAN 15-111
               guidance states that observations may be augmented for both the criteria listed in
               Table 1 and conditions that would adversely impact flight or ground operations
               (based on documented support unit requirements), this risk assessment is no
               longer necessary.
                   1.9.2.4.4.1. The ASF is authorized to supplement the prevailing visibility of
                   the AMOS weather observation when VFR conditions (5000 meters or 1500ft
                   AGL) are predominant over the airfield but the active sensor is reporting
                   unrepresentative values due to localized fog (i.e. the active sensor is sitting in
                   the only area of patchy fog on the flight line).
                     1.9.2.4.4.1.1. The ASF will only supplement if notification is received from
                     tower personnel indicating that operations are being impacted due to this
                     erroneous reading (i.e. VFR pattern closed, formation awaiting takeoff).
                     1.9.2.4.4.1.2. Based on ORM, supplementation will only take place during
                     daylight hours when sufficient visual cues are available for an accurate
                     manual observation.
       1.9.3. TAF. TAFs are coordinated with and issued by the 21 OWS RAB forecaster IAW
       AFMAN 15-124 using specification and amendment criteria as designated in AFMAN
       15-129V1 displayed in the Ramstein (ETAR) Installation Datasheet. Exception:
       Deviations required for SARs or Memorandums of Agreement (MOAs) for deployed
       weather teams.
           1.9.3.1. TAFs for RAB will be issued every 8 hours by the 21 OWS for the ICAO
           identifier ETAR and are valid for a 30-hour period. Official TAF issue times for
           RAB are 0200Z, 1000Z, and 1800Z and will be disseminated NLT 15 minutes past
           each respective issue time.

           1.9.3.2. Weather conditions within the TAF are forecast and amended for specific
           RAB amendment criteria listed in the Ramstein (ETAR) Installation Datasheet. If
           any unforecast criteria are occurring and are expected to persist for more than 30
           minutes, 21 OWS will amend the TAF. Of note, 21 OWS will amend the TAF to be
           representative of current conditions that are different from those initially forecast, at a
           minimum, when deemed operationally significant by the 86 OSS/OSW but that do
           not break amendment criteria.
           1.9.3.3. The RAB TAF primary means of dissemination is JET, see paragraph 1.9.4.
           for information regarding JET.

        1.9.4. Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET). JET is a computer dissemination system used
        to distribute weather information to wing agencies and into the AFW distribution network.
           1.9.4.1. JET is the primary dissemination tool for meteorological data on Ramstein
           (current airfield weather conditions, observations, TAFs, and weather WWAs).
           Operators requiring JET access should contact the 21 OWS to have an account and
           password created.
        1.9.5. Resource Protection - Weather WWA. Reference Chapter 2.
     1.10. Mission Integration Function (MIF).
RAMSTEINABI15-101 6 NOVEMBER 2013                                                              9


     1.10.1. Mission Integration involves gaining an in-depth understanding of supported
     mission platforms, equipment, and systems capabilities and sensitivities as well mission
     processes to reliably inject timely, accurate, and relevant environmental information at
     every decision point in the mission planning process to optimize mission execution. To
     ensure maximum mission integration, 86 OSS/OSW personnel executing the MIF will:
         1.10.1.1. Provide deployed or in place reachback mission planning, climatology,
         MEFs to include FWBs and stand-up crew briefings with requested space weather,
         volcanic ash plume, tropical system, air refueling tracks, primary and alternate
         destination weather, and DZ and LZ forecasts. Mission Execution Support will be
         provided primarily in the form of MWPs such as: MEF flimsy, DD Form 175-1,
         Weather Briefing, DZ and LZ forecast.
         1.10.1.2. Once crews are airborne, weather forecasters will MISSIONWATCH all
         missions briefed to pilots and notify the 37 AS and 76 AS Operations Centers of any
         mission-impacting changes to forecast weather.
  1.11. Staff Integration Function (SIF):
     1.11.1. 86 OSS/OSW SIF provides direct or continuing support to a mission set and
     determines both environmental threats and effective decision points to inject weather into
     the planning and execution process of the mission.
     1.11.2. SIF will:
         1.11.2.1. Ensure sound ORM principles and other safety considerations are applied to
         mitigate hazards to the mission.
         1.11.2.2. Emphasize the need to the chain of command for weather forces
         participation in combat related training through operational exercises.
         1.11.2.3. Ensure adequate resources are provided to meet mission requirements.
  1.12. Severe Weather Action Plan (SWAP). SWAP consists of actions taken by the WF to
  enhance the unit’s response capability during a severe weather event. Actions include, but
  are not limited to, recalling personnel or reallocating resources from other tasks, based on
  sound ORM practices, to provide focused support during a severe weather event.
     1.12.1. Severe Weather Recall. SWAP dictates that the duty weather technician (21
     OWS forecaster during non-duty hours) will contact the designated standby personnel
     whenever severe conditions are observed or forecast or for any weather situation, in the
     opinion of the duty technician, that constitutes a threat to Ramstein, regardless of whether
     the OWS has issued a weather warning and or watch. The technician will coordinate
     with the standby personnel on the actual requirement for their recall to the weather
     station, based on workload or severity of the weather situation. Severe weather recall is
     not a substitute for the alert notification pyramid on warning, watch and advisory
     dissemination. SWAP is designed to assist installation command personnel in managing
     severe weather events.
     1.12.2. Table 3 lists Ramstein SWAP criteria. Per AFMAN 15-129V1, tornadic activity
     and severe thunderstorms with hail GTE to ¾” require a forecaster to be present in order
     to provide the eyes forward function and supplementation as necessary. All other SWAP
     criteria will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis using ORM and flight leadership
 10                                              RAMSTEINABI15-101 6 NOVEMBER 2013


        coordination, if necessary, to determine whether or not the standby forecaster will report
        to the weather station. (For example, during heavy snow or freezing rain, the road
        conditions may not be safe for travel.) After normal duty hours, the standby forecaster
        will report to the weather station NLT 1 hour prior to the forecast weather warning
        conditions. Issuance of a Watch alone WILL NOT require the standby forecaster to
        report to the weather station. Exception: Tornado Watch requires the standby forecaster
        to report to the weather station to be ready to supplement for tornadic activity.
        1.12.3. At a minimum, notify the standby technician & Flt Chief (or Flt/CC) when a
        watch, or warning is issued or observed for any of the conditions in Table 3. Once a
        severe weather recall is activated, the team leader will intensify the “eyes forward” and
        MISSIONWATCH functions, and be prepared to supplement the weather observation as
        required. Intensifying “eyes forward” and MISSIONWATCH functions can include but
        is not limited to ceasing all non-operationally pertinent tasks (training, administrative
        tasks), assigning an additional forecaster to assist the on-duty or on-call duty personnel.
        Ensuring an expedited response to operational concerns is the top priority. The
        team leader will also perform data saves and emergency actions as necessary, consolidate
        and archive all pertinent weather data for an event that would require an OPREP-3 to be
        submitted by 86 AW/CP IAW AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting, AFI 10-229, and AFI
        10-206_USAFESUP_I, Operational Reporting. The OWS will be notified of the
        OPREP-3 and will provide the WF with copies of archived weather data as required.

     1.13.1. In the event of an emergency evacuation of all primary weather facilities listed in
     paragraph 1.7, 86 OSS/OSW personnel will resume duties at the AOL. Reference
     paragraph 1.7.1.2 for AOL information. NOTE: PMSV is not available at the AOL.
     Reference paragraph 3.5 for back up PMSV coverage.
     1.13.2. In the event of a JET communications outage, observations, PIREPs, TAFs and
     observed WWAs will be disseminated locally by office communicator, email, or
     telephone to ATC, GCA, CP, Airfield Management, and the 21 OWS. If the
     communication method is not simultaneous, ATC/GCA is contacted first. Lastly, the
     observations, PIREPs, TAFs and observed WWAs will be disseminated longline (i.e.
     internet). If the 86 OSS/OSW is unable, the 21 OWS will disseminate the data longline,
     and the 86 OSS/OSW will document WWAs and observations using hard copy
     procedures.
     1.13.3. In the event of a power outage or FMQ-19 outage, back up tactical weather
     equipment to include a TMQ-53 or TMOS, a laser range finder, Kestrel, visibility
     markers and compass will be utilized to continue providing a reduced ASF.
     1.13.4. In the event of a significant or catastrophic OWS communications outage, 86
     OSS/OSW will assume responsibility for the issuance and amendment of the RAB TAF,
     forecasted WWAs and FWBs for flights originating or transiting through RAB until
     which time 21 OWS has reconstituted to their Alternate Production Site.
     1.13.5. In the event of a significant or catastrophic communication outage or 86
     OSS/OSW personnel are no longer able to provide support to 86 AW agencies, 21 OWS
     assumes all 86 OSS/OSW weather support responsibilities as documented in AFMAN
     15-129V1, the most current Ramstein (ETAR) Installation Datasheet between 21 OWS
     and 86 AW, and this instruction.
2. WEATHER WATCHES, WARNINGS AND ADVISORIES (WWAs).
  2.1. General Information. WWAs are issued, as directed in AFMAN 15-129V1, Chapter
  4, to protect vital resources from hazardous conditions and to provide maximum flight safety.
  Each watch, warning, or advisory is assigned a number following the two-digit number of the
  current month (e.g. 08-001 would be the first WWA issued in August). Only one watch or
  warning will be in effect at one time for a given location, excluding the tornado warning and
  lightning watch or warning. Although only one watch or warning may be in effect at one
  time for a given location, multiple-criteria WWAs may be in effect at the same time for a
  single location. All WWAs are valid for an area within an 5 NM radius from the center of
  the Ramstein airfield midpoint. NOTE: WWAs are specifically issued for RAB and as such
  may not necessarily be valid or representative throughout the entire KMC.
  2.2. Definitions and Terms. WWAs consist of three distinct terms: watches, warnings, and
  advisories.
     2.2.1. Weather Warning. A special notice to notify installation personnel and
     supported units when an established weather condition of such intensity as to pose a
     hazard to life or property is occurring or expected to occur. Weather warnings provide
     concise information outlining environmental threats and are used to make resource
     protection decisions.

Figure 1. Weather Warning Example




         2.2.1.1. This example shows the second weather warning issued during the 5th
         month. The warning is for wind speeds between 35 and 50 knots, and is forecast to
         begin on the 12th day of May at 1700Z (1900L) and end the same day at 2000Z
         (2200L). The maximum expected value for wind speeds is 35 knots, and the wind
         direction is 260 degrees. This example also indicates that a separate Weather Watch
         05-003 and Weather Advisory 05-006 remain in effect.
      2.2.2. Weather Watch. A special notice to notify installation personnel and supported
      units of a potential for environmental conditions of such intensity as to pose a hazard to
      life or property. Weather watches indicate a potential for environmental threats and are
      used to make force protection and risk management decisions.

Figure 2. Weather Watch Example




         2.2.2.1. This example shows the first weather watch issued during the 5th month.
         The watch is for lightning within 5 NM, and is forecast to begin on the 2nd day of
         May at 1700Z (1900L) and end the same day at 2000Z (2200L). This example also
         indicates that a separate Weather Advisory 05-001 remains in effect.
      2.2.3. Weather Advisory. A special product notifying an end user when an established
      environmental condition affecting operations is occurring or is expected to occur.

Figure 3. Weather Advisory Example
RAMSTEINABI15-101 6 NOVEMBER 2013                                                        13


        2.2.3.1. This example shows the 9th weather advisory issued during the 5th month.
        The advisory is for wind speeds between 25 and 34 knots, and is forecast to begin on
        the 13th day of May at 1845Z (2045L) and end the same day at 2100Z (2300L). The
        maximum expected value for wind speeds is 25 knots, and the wind direction is 220
        degrees.
  2.3. Weather WWA Responsibilities.
     2.3.1. 86 OSS/OSW ASF technicians will work closely with the 21 OWS to issue,
     cancel, amend, and extend WWAs for RAB. 86 OSS/OSW will issue observed warnings
     and advisories during operating hours. 21 OWS will issue forecast WWAs. During 86
     OSS/OSW non-duty hours, 21 OWS will issue both observed and forecast WWAs.
     2.3.2. The 21 OWS issues forecast WWAs for operational threshold criteria IAW
     AFMAN 15-129V1, Chapter 4. The 86 OSS/OSW will issue all the observed advisories,
     as well as the warning for lightning observed within 5 NM of the airfield complex. The
     OWS will assume responsibility for this warning during weather station closure.
     2.3.3. Under rare circumstances 86 OSS/OSW may, without prior coordination, issue
     WWAs to facilitate resource protection actions when sufficient time does not exist to
     communicate a change in weather with the 21 OWS. The 86 OSS/OSW will forward
     pertinent information to the 21 OWS to ensure the warning is entered into the AFW
     dissemination system. (Ref. AFMAN 15-129V1, Table 4.2).
     2.3.4. WWA responsibilities for 86 AW while deployed are coordinated with 21 OWS
     and included in SARs, if necessary.
  2.4. Dissemination and Criteria. WWA dissemination and criteria with desired lead time
  (DLT) are outlined in the Ramstein (ETAR) Installation Datasheet under the “Unique WWA
  Support” tab.
     2.4.1. 21 OWS disseminates all RAB WWAs to 86 OSS/OSW by automated phone
     messaging system, email and JET.
     2.4.2. 21 OWS posts all EUCOM AOR WWAs onto the 21 OWS NIPRNET and
     SIPRNET web pages.
     2.4.3. The criteria for the WWA is coordinated and outlined by the supporting
     documents between the 86 OSS/OSW and 21 OWS.
3. SUPPORT TO FLYING OPERATIONS.
  3.1. Local Flying Squadrons. There are two flying squadrons assigned to the 86 AW that
  86 OSS/OSW is tasked to support.
     3.1.1. Assumptions. 86 OSS/OSW will use access GDSSII to the maximum extent
     possible to integrate into supported units.
     3.1.2. Shortfalls. 86 OSS/OSW does not have visibility of any further mission data not
     listed in GDSSII. 86 AW aircrews are required to maintain consistent dialog with the
     MIF during all phases of mission execution. Exception: During 37 AS MIF operations,
     the MIF has access to the 37th Scheduling Board information, Reference paragraph
     1.7.2.2.

     3.1.3. 37 AS. 86 OSS/OSW provides routine training mission weather support to 37 AS.
        3.1.3.1. Airframes Used. The 37 AS operates the C-130J model for tactical airlift.
        3.1.3.2. Commonly Used Local Flying Areas. 37 AS commonly uses local airspace
        around RAB and airspace throughout Germany, eastern France, and the Benelux.
            3.1.3.2.1. Drop Zones and Operating Areas. In addition to local airspace, 37

Terms
Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA)—A strategic weather center at Offutt AFB NE, providing
atmospheric data and analysis and forecast products required by the regional OWSs and the WFs
worldwide. AFWA provides the centralized repository for global observations and forecasts that
are data based at AFWA and, in turn, disseminated to DoD weather data users worldwide. In
addition to global observations and forecasts collected from worldwide sources, AFWA collects
meteorological satellite data from multiple sources. Based on global analysis of available data,
AFWA creates global analysis and forecast products to meet the forecast requirements of its
supported users.
Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR)—The WMO METAR code format used
worldwide to encode weather observations.
Aviation Selected Special Weather Report (SPECI)—An unscheduled report taken when
certain criteria have been met.
Basic Weather Watch (BWW)—Weather technicians will recheck weather conditions at
intervals not the exceed 20 minutes since the last observation or recheck, to determine the need
for a SPECI observation.
Continuous Weather Watch (CWW)—Weather technicians will monitor weather conditions
continuously and perform no other significant duties. In addition to taking METARs, weather
technicians will take and disseminate observations as conditions occur that meet SPECI
observation criteria. Weather flights may perform a CWW during AMOS augmentation if locally
determined to be more appropriate due to existing meteorological conditions.
Desired Lead Time (DLT)—The total amount of time required to disseminate a forecast WWA
from the supporting OWS through the local dissemination tree to all affected end-users plus the
amount of advance notice a supported organization requires to complete mandatory protective
actions before the onset of a particular weather phenomenon.
ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) Identifier—A specifically authorized 4-
letter identifier assigned to a location. The ICAO is not to be confused with the Routing
RAMSTEINABI15-101 6 NOVEMBER 2013                                                              35


Identifier used by the Automatic Digital Weather Switch to transmit addressed messages
including Automated Response to Queries. Routing IDs may not always match a station ICAO
and can have 5 characters.
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)—A United Nations organization
specializing in international aviation and navigation.
METWATCH (Meteorological Watch)—A deliberate process for monitoring terrestrial
weather or the space environment in an area or region. The purpose of a METWATCH is to
identify when and where observed conditions significantly diverge from forecast conditions and
determining courses of action to update or amend a forecast product or group of products and
designated agencies notified. Strategic and Operational level weather units typically conduct
METWATCH activities
Mission Weather Product (MWP)—Any weather product or group of weather products
generated by an Exploitation Unit that is integrated into the military decision making process.
MWPs may be planning or execution products and are not limited to aviation missions.
MISSIONWATCH (Mission Meteorological Watch)—A deliberate process for monitoring
terrestrial weather or the space environment for specific mission-limiting environmental factors.
The MISSIONWATCH process identifies and alerts decision-makers to changes affecting
mission success.
Operational Weather Squadron (OWS)—A characterization unit comprised of management,
technician, and training personnel responsible for providing regional weather support. Their
mission is to produce fine-scale tailored weather forecast products and services to supported
users within their area of responsibility (AOR).
Pilot Report (PIREP)—A report of in-flight weather provided by an aircrew member.
Severe Weather Action Plan (SWAP)—Actions taken by a weather unit to enhance the unit’s
response capability during a severe weather event. Actions include, but are not limited to,
recalling personnel or reallocating resources from other tasks to provide focused support during a
severe weather event.
Support Assistance Request (SAR)—Used to request specialized weather, space
environmental, or climatological support from the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA), 14 WS,
MAJCOMs, or Operational Weather Squadrons (OWS).
Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF)—A standard text forecast containing the cloud cover,
cloud heights, and visibility for general flight rule conditions (IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 3,
General Flight Rules; and AR 95-1, Flight Regulations), as well as wind, altimeter, and other
weather parameters needed to sustain the landing and takeoff of aircraft.
Weather Advisory (WA)—A special product notifying an end user when an established
environmental condition affecting operations is occurring or is expected to occur.
Weather Warning (WW)—A special notice to notify installation personnel and supported units
when an established weather condition of such intensity as to pose a hazard to life or property is
occurring or expected to occur. Weather warnings provide concise information outlining
environmental threats and are used to make resource protection decisions.
