1 January – 31 December              AW/CCC               the 433 AW/CCC           As Scheduled
   6.1. Nominations for Twelve Outstanding Airmen of the Year (12 OAY), First Sergeant of
   the Year, and Junior Officer of the Year are due by the suspense date established by 4th Air
   Force (normally mid January).
7. Evaluation Process for 433 AW Quarterly and Annual Boards.
   7.1. Effective evaluation of the AF Form 1206, Nomination for Award, requires a detailed
   process. Strong emphasis must be on initiative, achievement, and impact, not writing style.
   7.2. The Board President and each Board Member will be provided a BLUE two-pocket
   folder that contains an AF Form 1206, official MilPds Record Review Rip, Air Force Fitness
   Assessment Score Sheet, and a 433d Airlift Wing Quarterly Awards Board Nomination
   Package Checklist, 433d Airlift and a Wing Award Program Individual’s Score Card
   (Attachment 6).
   7.3. An interview schedule will be provided to Commanders, First Sergeants, and
   Supervisors prior to the board date. Nominees are encouraged to arrive at least 15 minutes
   early and should plan to be there for up to one hour. Interviews may last 5-10 minutes.
      7.3.1. It is appropriate to have a practice interview at the unit level to help the members
      feel at ease in this environment.
   7.4. Everyone in a category meeting the board will be asked the same questions. Different
   questions may be used for different categories if the Board President deems the change is
   justified to reflect the level of military experience in that category. The questions will not
   allow for just a ―yes or no‖ answer. They will be constructed to ask for an opinion and there
   are no wrong answers.
      7.4.1. At the conclusion of each interview, only the Board President may ask for
      feedback from a nominee. It is appropriate for nominees to ask questions or provide
      comments regarding programs or policies. This is an opportunity for Wing members to
      provide feedback to Wing leadership. The nominee’s comments will not be scored or
      affect the current score given. All score sheets will be collected by the Board President
      prior to asking the nominee for additional feedback.
   7.5. The quarterly winner in each category is automatically eligible for consideration by their
   Group to meet the 433d Wing Annual Awards Board. Additional information will be
   provided in time to the Group and Squadron Commanders to complete these special selection
   Board packages.
      7.5.1. The package content and structure for the Annual Wing Board will be determined
      by 4th AF guidelines for package submission. The Annual Board Structure is outlined in
      5.1. Since there is no interview process, the additional 40 points will be applied to the
      additional documentation required in the annual package as determined by the
      433AW/CC and the 433 AW/CV at the time the Annual Wing Board is convened.
10                                                       433AWI36-2801 4 OCTOBER 2011


     7.5.2. The 433AW/CC or the 433 AW/CV or appointed Board President will determine
     the nominee reviewing process for packages submitted to the convening board using
     433d Airlift Wing Instruction 36-2801 as a guideline to identify the most qualified
     candidate for the 4th AF OAY board.
  7.6. When evaluating an AF Form 1206, the individual’s write-up must not exceed 13 lines;
  sub-bullets are discouraged and count towards the maximum of number of lines.
  Nominations will be single-spaced typewritten lines, including the three category headings:
  Leadership & Job Performance, Significant Self-Improvement, and Base/Community
  Involvement. Nominations should include specific facts, achievements, and examples
  showing individuals are exceptional. Achievements should distinguish the nominee from his
  or her peers. Acronym’s are authorized and must be spelled out on back of AF Form 1206.
     7.6.1. Evaluation for both the quarterly and annual awards will be based on a
     combination of the AF Form 1206 (most current version), and the personal interview
     for a total score of 100. The AF Form 1206 is worth 60 percent of the overall weighted
     score; (1) Leadership & Job Performance: the individual’s primary duty is the most
     important area within the AF Form 1206 and is worth 40 points. (2) The other two areas,
     Significant Self-improvement and Base/Community involvement are worth 10 points
     each for a total of 20 points combined. The Personal Interview is worth 40 percent of
     overall weighted value comprised of the following: (1) Dress and Appearance, and
     Military Bearing are worth 4 points each for a total of 8 points, (2) Communication Skills
     as demonstrated in the interview portion make up the remaining 32 points.
     7.6.2. There are only three approved categories: Leadership & Job Performance,
     Significant Self-Improvement and Base/Community Involvement that will be scored.
     Any combination of lines may be used to fulfill the 13 line requirement, but achievement
     or accomplishment placed in the wrong category will not be scored. Additionally, any
     lines exceeding the maximum number of lines will not be scored. Each line will be
     evaluated on its own merit. Board members have the opportunity to award the maximum
     points to each section and can score each category using whole or half point increments.
         7.6.2.1. Leadership & Job Performance (40 points maximum): This section should
         incorporate 66% of each nominee’s total write-up. Describe significant leadership
         accomplishment and how well the nominee performed assigned primary and
         additional duties. Define the scope and level of responsibilities and the impact on the
         mission and unit. Include any new initiatives or techniques developed by the nominee
         that positively impacted the unit and/or the mission. Include results of Air Force,
         Major Command (MAJCOM), and Numbered Air Force-level inspections and/or
         evaluations. Include awards received; e.g., Maintenance Professional of the Year, and
         so forth. Below are guidelines to assist board members in differentiating the impact
         on the mission and leadership role.
            7.6.2.1.1. Innovative Methods/Programs, developed, designed, implemented, and
            impact etc.
            7.6.2.1.2. Process Improvement – cost saving, percentage improved or reduced,

          7.6.2.2. Significant Self-Improvement (10 points maximum): The primary focus of
          this section is the nominee’s professional and personal development and how it
          benefits the Air Force. This section should incorporate 17% of the individual’s total
          write-up. Although most board members are familiar with this category the key
          factors to this are individual commitment level and personal sacrifice. This category
          may be judged by the following questions: How much time was expended? How
          much effort was involved? Was the achievement done on duty or during individual
          off-duty time?
              7.6.2.2.1. Off-duty Education—College (in-residence, on-line, correspondence

          7.6.2.3. Base/Community Involvement (10 points maximum): This section rounds
          out the whole person concept. The section should incorporate 17% of the individual’s
          total write-up. The nominee’s commitment level and personal sacrifice are the key
          factors in evaluating this section. How much time and effort was involved? What was
          the amount of time committed to the achievement and the frequency? Did the
          nominee participate or lead the effort?

                                 HOW TO MEET A BOARD

                                   HOW TO MEET A BOARD
                                          PREPARATION
First impressions are lasting impressions; therefore, your military bearing must be impeccable.
The board will be looking for sharp, snappy, and precise facing movements. All boards allow
points for dress and appearance. If you master all items listed, you are guaranteed all of them.
    1. Have your uniform, FULL SERVICE DRESS ready well in advance of the day you are to
         meet the board. Some handy tips:
             a. Check your uniform for proper size and length. If in doubt have your supervisor
                 check it. Do not mix suit pants and coats.
             b. Make sure your uniform is cleaned and pressed well ahead of time. Take a look
                 at your shoes and ensure they are serviceable and clean. Check out all those
                 ribbons you have earned and make sure they are serviceable and also match what
                 your VMPF rip says.
    2. Males: Get a haircut that far exceeds the standards one day prior to meeting the board.
         Females: The same applies, but make sure the hair on the back of the neck does not
         extend lower than the bottom of your collar.
    3. When practicing your speech, practice panning the board while speaking. Talk to
         everyone on the board, not just the chairperson. Good eye contact is essential for good
         communication. You are graded on how well you communicate. Panning also helps you
         to relax.
    4. Be early. When you arrive, there will be a Sgt of Arms standing outside the meeting
    room. He/she will provide instructions, such as reporting procedures. If not, be sure to ask.
    5. Do not take your hat or your purse into the room.
    6. If you are instructed to knock before entering, knock once, firmly. Await to be told to
    enter from the board panel.
    7. When you open the door, take a good look at the room. Look for the chair you will be
    sitting in. March the most direct route to position yourself in front of the chair facing the
    board president. Perform the most appropriate facing moving to center yourself on the table.
    You will say “Sir/Ma’am, Airman/Sergeant reports to the Junior Enlisted Member of
    the Quarter or Year/NCO of the Quarter or Year Board/ Senior Enlisted of the Quarter
    or Year as directed.” The board president will say, ―Please have a seat.‖
    8. It is highly encouraged to sit at attention or a relaxed position of attention.
    9. Sit down on the edge of the chair with a small gap between your back and the chair back.
    Do not lean back- this will wrinkle the back of your uniform and create the image of being
    too laid back.
    10. Sit at attention and place your hands on your thighs.
    11. When answering questions, do not turn your body; turn your head and face towards the
    persons asking the questions. Smile and establish a rapport with the board.
    12. After being asked a question, repeat the question and giver your answers always using
    Sir/Ma’am. Try to give more than the basic answer, and use the full name and rank in your
    answer. Example: ―What is the most important line in the Amn’s Creed to you and why?‖
    ―Ma’am, the most important line to me, is I am Wingman, Leader and Warrior because when
    I do all these things I am impacting our AF mission and I will always be prepared for what
 30                                                        433AWI36-2801 4 OCTOBER 2011


   the AF has to offer me.‖ While answering the question, pan the board. Good eye contact
   with the board is critical as each board member will be grading you on how well you
   communicate.
   13. If you do not understand a question, ask them to repeat it.
   14. If you do not know the answer to a question, answer, ―Sir/Ma’am, I do not know the
   answer.‖ However, should you recall the answer to a previous question you did not answer
   or felt you answered incorrectly, be sure to ask the chairperson for permission to answer that
   question.
   15. If they ask, ―Do you have any comments?‖, then answer, ―Sir/Ma’am, I would like to
   take this time to thank the members of the board. It has been an honor and privilege to meet
   the board. Thank you very much.‖
   16. When you are finished, the chairperson will instruct you that you are dismissed.
            a. Answer, ―Thank you, Sir/Ma’am.‖ Stand back up at the position of attention,
               execute the appropriate facing movements and march to the door.
OVERALL
Be yourself. The board wants to know you. You must believe you are worthy of the award being
presented. Someone else did. You would not have been nominated otherwise. REMEMBER:
You are going to be nervous. This is natural, everyone else will be nervous too, including the
board members. But, if you prepare well ahead of time (practice makes perfect), your self-
confidence will overshadow any nervousness you have. Good luck!
