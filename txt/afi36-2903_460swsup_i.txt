            accommodations is legitimate, military personnel should avoid wearing the uniform to
            avoid the public perception of the misuse of government travel resources, which generates
            unnecessary complaints.
         6. Officers and Enlisted: Do not wear or mix unique uniform items with civilian clothes.

12. (Added) Recalls or Squadron and Higher Level Exercises. The standard uniform for these events
is the BDU (with BDU cap and subdued insignia if officer) or FDU. If a recall or exercise is initiated
during the duty day assigned personnel should not make a special trip home to change into the BDU or
FDU (unless directed to do so). Exceptions to this policy are authorized for formal events such as
retirement ceremonies, promotion ceremonies, etc.


13. (Added) Force Protection Condition (FPCON) Charlie. When the base security posture is
increased to FPCON Charlie or higher (exercise or real-world), all personnel should wear the BDU (with

exceptions are authorized for formal events such as retirement ceremonies, promotion ceremonies, etc.


14. (Added) Operations Personnel. Mission-ready and mission-support personnel working shift in the
Mission Control Station (MCS) or working in the MCS training suite will wear the FDU or BDU,
respectively. Group and squadron leadership, as well as day-shift space operators who are mission ready
or in training for operations will also wear the FDU, since their duties may require their presence on the
operations floor to meet mission requirements. Wear of the hood is authorized with the FDU green
jacket during winter months. When wearing the hood, the flight cap must be carried. The hood will only
be used for cold weather protection, and is not intended as the primary hat during the winter.


15. (Added) For force protection and Operations Security (OPSEC) concerns, civilian clothes are
authorized when performing duty at the Interim Mission Control Station Back-up (IMCSB). Clothing at
the IMCSB must present a professional image (i.e. business casual) IAW 2d Space Warning Squadron
commander guidance.


16. (Added) Operations personnel in Duties Not Including Flying (DNIF) or Duties Not Involving
Controlling (DNIC) status longer than 10 days, decertified, or awaiting a security clearance will wear the
BDU vice FDU as a daily uniform, unless performing duties in the command post.


17. (Added) Protective gear worn while operating a motorcycle must be removed immediately after
dismounting the vehicle.


18. (Added) Uniform of the day Monday through Friday is the BDU or FDU, if authorized to wear. The
last duty day of each month is declared “Blues Day,” in which all 460 SW members will wear an
appropriate combination of the blue service uniform, except for personnel performing maintenance and
outside planned duty.


19. (Added) Unit commanders should decide the wear for international service members when
participating in organized physical training. Color of gear should be consistent with the Air Force
physical training gear.

NOTES:
(All notes apply)
           1. The items listed represent common appearance issues and are not all-inclusive.
           2. Commanders do not have the authority to waive appearance and grooming standards
              except as identified.
           3. Installation commanders will determine what is extreme or faddish. The Installation com-
              mander may delegate this authority to subordinate commanders to the squadron com-
              mander level.
           4. During tours of less than 30 days, Reserve and Air National Guard (ANG) chaplains not
              on extended active duty may request a waiver for religious observance when consistent
              with their faith. For Air Force Reserve waiver-processing instructions see AFMAN
              36-8001. For ANG waiver-processing instructions submit requests to NGB/HC, 1411 Jef-
              ferson Davis Hwy, Arlington, VA 22202-3231.

     5. If due to a temporary medical condition ie., radiation/chemotherapy and resulting in bald-
        ness, commanders will authorize the wear of the cancer approved American Society cap
        (black/tan).
     6. Will not apply designs to nails or apply two-tone or multi-tone colors on duty excluding
        French manicure.
     7. (Women) Medical waivers are required for situations that require baldness as a medical
        necessity while in uniform.
     8. The intent of this item is that long hair should be styled in a manner that prevents loose
        ends from extending upward on the head. (For example: when using the claw clip or hair-
        pins, hair will not present the appearance of a “rooster tail”; when hair is in a bun, all loose
        ends must be tucked in and secured; when hair is in a pony tail, it must be pulled all the
        way through the elastic band and may hang naturally downward, not extending below the
        bottom of the collar). As with all hairstyles, a neat and professional image is essential.

                     detract from an appropriate professional image while in uniform.
                     Commanders should use these guidelines in determining appropriate
                     military image and acceptability of tattoos displayed by members in
                     uniform. Air Force members with tattoos not meeting an acceptable
                     military image should be required to (a) maintain complete coverage of the
                     tattoos using current uniform items (e.g. long-sleeved shirt/blouse, pants/
                     slacks, dark hosiery, PT running suit, etc.) or (b) remove tattoo(s).
                     Depending on the circumstances, commanders may seek Air Force medical
                     support for voluntary tattoo removal. PTDY is not authorized in this
                     situation and is at member’s expense. Members failing to remove, cover, or
                     alter excessive tattoos or who choose not to comply with acceptable
                     military standards may be subject to disciplinary action or involuntary
                     separation. Failure to observe these mandatory provisions and
                     prohibitions by active duty Air Force members, USAFR members on
                     active duty or inactive duty for training and ANG members in Federal
                     service is a violation of Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice
                     (UCMJ). (See notes 2, 4, 5 and 6).

NOTES:
  1. Members who intentionally alter or modify any part of their bodies in order to achieve a visible,
     physical effect that disfigures, deforms or otherwise detracts from a professional military image
     may be subject to disciplinary action or involuntary separation, as determined appropriate by the
     member’s commander. Examples of prohibited conduct include (but are not limited to) tongue
     splitting or forking, tooth filing and acquiring visible, disfiguring skin implants.
     2. Installation or higher commanders may impose more restrictive standards for tattoos and body
        ornaments, on or off duty, in those locations where Air Force-wide standards may not be adequate
        to address cultural sensitivities (e.g., overseas) or mission requirements (e.g.; basic training envi-
        ronments).
     3. Members who receive tattoos/brands not meeting the standards are required to initiate tattoos/
        brands removal at their own expense (may not use Air Force Medical Centers for removal) upon
        notification by their Commander. Members not complying with these requirements will be sub-
        ject to disciplinary action for failure to comply with Air Force Standards and may be involuntarily
        separated.
     4. There may be situations where the commander can restrict the wear of non-visible body orna-
        ments. Those situations would include any body ornamentation that interferes with the perfor-
        mance of the member’s military duties. The factors to be evaluated in making this determination
        include, but are not limited to: impairs the safe and effective operation of weapons, military
        equipment or machinery; poses a health or safety hazard to the wearer or others; or interferes with
        the proper wear of special or protective clothing or equipment (EXAMPLE: helmets, flack jack-
        ets, flight suits, camouflaged uniforms, gas masks, wet suits and crash rescue equipment.)
     5. Tattoo/branding policy went into effect 15 March 1998.
     6. Members who receive tattoos/brands not meeting the standards after the implementation of this
        policy are required to initiate tattoos/brands removal at their own expense upon notification by
        their Commander. Members not complying with these requirements will be subject to disciplin-
        ary action for failure to comply with Air Force Standards and may be involuntarily separated.

4.1. Wear Instructions. Wear regular or miniature size medals and ribbons, except for the Medal of
Honor (neck decoration). Do not mix sizes. Do not wear medals and ribbons on outergarments such as
all-weather coat, overcoat, and lightweight blue jacket. For order of precedence for awards and decora-
tions, see Figure 4.1. For arrangement of devices and ribbons, see Figure 4.2. and Figure 4.3. For
arrangement of medals by rows, see Table 4.1. For arrangement of ribbons on service uniforms, see
Table 4.2. For placement of medals on dress coat or jacket, see Table 4.3. Wear only authorized Air
Force awards and devices when wearing ribbons and medals.

4.2. Foreign Decorations. Decorations proffered by foreign governments such as a ribbon, medal
device, a badge, sash, sunburst, or neck-type decorations. Air Force Instruction 36-2803, The Air Force
Awards and Decorations Program, specifies how to accept foreign decorations and the authority required
for award acceptance by members. Members must have permission to wear foreign decorations they
accept. Wear criteria depends on the type of device the decoration represents.
   4.2.1. Wear sash, sunburst, or neck-type foreign decorations with the formal dress uniform only,
   according to the customs of the awarding nation. Wear only one type at a time.

awards take precedence over equal awards. Wear awards for wars, campaigns, and expeditions in the

Force ribbons. When members wear these awards with their Air Force ribbons, they must purchase rib-
bons that are the same size as their Air Force ribbons.

discharged and retired Air Force members may wear full-size or miniature medals on civilian suits on
appropriate occasions such as Memorial Day and Armed Forces Day. Female members may wear
full-size or miniature medals on equivalent dress.

medal with the highest precedence nearest the lapel on the top row.

NOTES:
  1. Wear the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal (DSM) ahead of a Distinguished Service Medal
     awarded by the Army, Navy, and Coast Guard.
   2. Awarded only by the Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard.
   3. A few of the decorations awarded by federal agencies are: Medal of Merit, National Security
      Medal, Presidential Medal of Freedom, Medal of Freedom, Gold and Silver Lifesaving Medals,
      NASA Distinguished Service Medal, Public Health Service Decorations (Distinguished Service
      Medal, Meritorious Service Medal, and Commendation Medal); US Maritime Service Decora-
      tions (Distinguished Service Medal, Meritorious Service Medal, and Mariner’s Medal). Do not
      wear these decorations unless you wear US military decorations and service medals. If you wear
      more than one, arrange them in the order of acceptance. If you wear two or more from the same
      agency, that agency decides the precedence. Ribbons must be the same size as Air Force ribbons.
      Wear only those decoration ribbons awarded by federal agencies and earned while in military ser-
      vice.
   4. The American Campaign Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, and European-African-Middle
      Eastern Campaign Medal are World War II Theater Campaign Medals. If authorized more than
      one, wear them in the order earned.
   5. When awarded more than one clasp, wear in the order earned on the suspension ribbon. Do not
      wear clasps on the service ribbon.
   6. Do not wear these decorations unless you wear other US military decorations and service medals.
      When authorized more than one, wear them in the order earned. If authorized more than one from
      the same foreign country, wear them in the order the country prescribes. On special occasions and
      as a matter of courtesy to a given country, you may wear the decorations of that country ahead of
      all other foreign decoration
   7. Before you wear Foreign Service ribbons, meet conditions in AFI 36-2803. When authorized to
      wear more than one, wear them in the order earned.
   8. Includes ribbons such as: Multinational Force Observers Medal and Inter-American Defense
      Board Medal. Wear these ribbons in the order earned and ensure they are the same size as Air
      Force ribbons.
   9. Only personnel who have served in the U.S. Navy are authorized to wear either the Navy Expert
      Rifle or Navy Expert Pistol Shot Ribbon/Medal

Figure 4.2. Placement of Devices on Ribbons and Medals.




NOTES:
  1. Wear a maximum of four devices on each ribbon. Place silver devices to the wearer's right of
     bronze devices. Replace the bronze device with a silver device after receipt of the fifth bronze
     device. Place clusters horizontally and tilt slightly downward to the wearer's right to allow maxi-
     mum number of clusters and other devices on the ribbon. Tilt all or none.
      2. On medals, place clusters vertically with silver clusters and stars above similar bronze devices.
      3. If all authorized devices do not fit on a single ribbon, wear a second ribbon. Wear a minimum of
         3 devices on the first ribbon before wearing a second ribbon. When wearing the second ribbon,
         place after the initial ribbon. It counts for one award. When future awards reduce devices to a
         single ribbon, remove the second ribbon.
      4. Wear regular devices on regular medals and regular ribbons; miniature devices on miniature rib-
         bons and medals. Wear all the same size devices.
      5. There are two methods of affixing devices on ribbons: a separate device or single-constructed
         device (2 or more devices manufactured together). When affixing separate devices to the ribbon,
         space devices equally. If using single-constructed device, center it. If using single-constructed
         device on one ribbon, use it on all ribbons. Place silver clusters, stars, etc., above similar bronze
         devices. EXCEPTION: Mix single-constructed devices with separate devices if the combina-
         tion of devices authorized is not available as a single-constructed device. In this event, place the
AFI36-2903_460SW_I 28 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                 139


      devices close to one another so they give the appearance of a single-constructed device as long as
      the devices are the same; i.e., bronze cluster and silver cluster. Wear only separate devices on
      medals. Wear a maximum of 4 unless wearing more prevents adding a second medal. Wear rib-
      bons awarded by other Services with appropriate device that Service authorized.

NOTES:
  1. WITH HOLDING BAR: The maximum length of holding bars for medals is 2 3/4 inches. When
     wearing fewer than 5 miniature medals or 4 regular-size medals, expose all. If wearing more than
     4 miniature or 3 regular medals on one row, each medal equally overlaps the medal to the left.
     The overlap does not exceed 50 percent. Expose the medal nearest the lapel. Stack and center the
     second or additional row of medals upward. The medal overlaps approximately 50 percent of the
     ribbon on the row below.
     2. WITH MOUNTING BAR: Wear the medal with the highest precedence on the top row nearest
        the lapel. Stack and center the second and additional rows of medals below. The medal will over-
        lap approximately 50 percent of the ribbon on the row below.

   officer career fields to determine the earned badge level. Time in Sister Service career fields is not
   used to determine earned badge level for Air Force occupational badges.

      10. Guidelines for wear of the Space Badge.
         a. The Space Badge is worn by officers and enlisted personnel designated as USAF Cre-
            dentialed Space Professionals (CSPs).
         b. Order of Precedence – The Space Badge is equal in precedence to aeronautical badges
            and worn above all other occupational badges and the parachutist badge. When
            awarded both Aeronautical and Space Badges, wear the Space Badge above the Aero-
            nautical Badge only when occupying a space billet.
         c. The criteria to earn the basic, senior and command space badges, respectively, are
            directly linked to the 3-level Space Professional Certification Program. For enlisted
            personnel, badge award is not solely linked to skill level attainment. Officer and
            enlisted personnel may verify their Credentialed Space Professional certification level
            by contacting the Space Professional Management Office, AFSPC/A1FX, 150 Van-
            denberg St Suite 1105, Peterson AFB, CO 80914-4450. Call them at DSN 692-3494 or
            visit their website at: http://www.peterson.af.mil/spacepro
         d. Basic Space Badge – Certification Level 1 – Completion of Space 100, maintain cur-
            rency with all acquisition or operational position-specific training requirements, 1 year
            satisfactory performance in a space-coded billet culminating with Space Professional
            Certification briefing to Wing CC/CV or equivalent. Additionally, enlisted CSPs must
            attain the 5 skill level to earn the Basic Space Badge.
         e. Senior Space Badge – Certification Level 2 – Completion of Space 200, maintain cur-
            rency with all position-specific requirements, 6 years satisfactory performance in
            space-coded billets.
AFI36-2903_460SW_I 28 FEBRUARY 2007                                                             151


           f. Command Space Badge – Certification Level 3 – Completion of Space 300, maintain
              currency with all position-specific requirements, 9 years satisfactory performance in
              space-coded billets. Additionally, enlisted CSPs must complete requirements for
              CCAF degree in space operations to earn the Command Badge.
           g. CDRUSSTRATCOM and AFSPC/CC are authorized wear of the command Space
              Badge upon assumption of their position. Not authorized for wear when no longer
              holding these positions unless it was previously earned.
           h. For General Officers not previously awarded the badge, award the basic Space Badge
              1 year after assumption of position and completion of the National Security Space
              Institute’s Space Operations Executive Level Course. Award senior and command
              badges at one year increments.
           i. AFSPC/CC, as the Space Professional Functional Authority approves qualifying space
              specialties and award criteria for allied and other US service members. Once the award
              criteria are approved, allied and other US services will control badge awarding for
              their respective service members.
        11. Permanent assignment denotes non TDY status. This rule also applies to other badges or
            patches i.e., Army Combat Patches earned or awarded by sister service components.
            Upon Permanent Change of Station (PCS) to an Air Force unit the member will remove
            them.

NOTES:
8. Retirees may wear civilian clothing when flying in military aircraft. They will present a favorable
appearance in good taste. Members of the reserve components who are eligible to retire but are not at
mandatory retirement age (60 years) do not wear the uniform while traveling on military aircraft.
9. Honorably discharged members who served during World War II wear the Honorable Discharge
Emblem on the left lapel.
10. Installation commanders authorize such separatees to use military clothing sales stores (MCSS) to
purchase uniforms and accessories required for special occasions such as military funerals, parades, or
other ceremonies. Separatees purchase only the service dress or mess dress uniforms and accessories.
Separatees may not purchase items commonly available from commercial sources. MCSSs establish
adequate controls over quantities of uniform items each separatee purchases. Commanders ensure
separatees present proof of honorable discharge under honorable conditions and know current uniform
and grooming standards.

                                                  Chapter 7

                             UNIFORM CHANGES AND SUPPLEMENTS

7.1. How To Recommend Uniform Changes. Submit proposals for new or changed uniform clothing
items and wear criteria into the Air Force IDEA Program Data System (IPDS [https://ideas.ran-
dolph.af.mil]). Process applications in accordance with AFI 38-401, The Air Force Innovative Develop-
ment Through Employee Awareness (IDEA) Program. Process requests for reconsideration for
disapproved proposals the same as initial proposals. They are exempt from the automatic higher-level
review provisions of AFI 38-401.
      7.1.1. Processing IDEAs. Host base MPF Customer Service Element considers each proposal.
      Base-level agencies, e.g., hospital, and safety, provide comments as needed. The installation com-
      mander signs proposals recommended for approval with rationale for approval and forwards to the
      submitter’s MAJCOM Director of Personnel. The MPF Commander has disapproval authority when
      the proposal is not a new idea, when it duplicates a previous idea with "ownership" rights, or when the
      proposal clearly is not beneficial or desirable. The MPF Commander will complete the evaluation in
      IPDS as the disapproving authority and will include the reason for the disapproval. For disapproval
      reasons other than above, the MPF Commander will include the following statement in the text of the
      evaluation "not recommended for adoption, but disapproval not within the authority of this office".
      7.1.2. Uniform Boards. Uniform Boards. MAJCOMs conduct their own uniform boards to evaluate
      each proposal. The commander, vice commander, or chief of staff signs proposals recommended for
      approval and sends them to HQ AFPC/DPSOOC, 550 C Street West, Suite 37, Randolph AFB TX
      78150-4738. HQ AFPC/ DPSOOC will conduct a quality review and consolidate proposals to the Air
      Force Uniform Board (AFUB). The AFUB evaluates each proposal and makes recommendations to
      the Chief of Staff, USAF. If the MAJCOM disapproves the proposal, return it and the reasons for dis-
      approval through command channels.
      7.1.3. Air Staff, Field Operating Agencies (FOA), and Direct Reporting Units (DRU) Recommenda-
      tions. FOA and DRU commanders, Air Staff Deputy Chiefs of Staff (DCS), and their assistants, sub-
      mit recommendations directly to the AFUB.
      7.1.4. Air Force Academy Uniform Board. The Superintendent, United States Air Force Academy
      (USAFA), appoints an Air Force Academy Cadet Uniform Board to review all proposed changes to
      Air Force cadet and preparatory school student uniforms. The Superintendent may approve changes
      regarding USAFA cadet and preparatory student uniform accessories and insignia, but must send
      other proposed changes to the Chief of Staff, USAF, for final approval. Proposed changes to the stan-
      dard Air Force uniform or wear criteria are submitted directly to the AFUB.
      7.1.5. The AFUB. This board, composed of senior Air Force personnel, ensures the Air Force uni-
      form is plain and distinctive, and develops consistent policy on all uniform matters. It reviews and
      selects items of uniform clothing, accessories, and insignia, which the Chief of Staff, AF, approves.
      AFUB changes are effective when incorporated into this instruction or other guidance as prescribed
      by AF/A1.
      7.1.6. Test Uniforms. Members wear test uniform items as part of an authorized test program.
      Unless, otherwise directed, members may wear test uniform items approved for Air Force use after the
      test period. AF/A1 determines which individuals, units or commands will test new uniform items.

7.2. Processing Supplements.
   7.2.1. Include all rules for local wear and additional uniform guidance in a supplement to this direc-
   tive. Refer to AFI 33-360, vol 1, Air Force Content Management Program--Publications.
   7.2.2. MAJCOMs approve their base supplements if instructions are within the guidelines of the basic
   directive. Coordinate any proposals deviating from current policy with Headquarters Air Force Per-
   sonnel Center, Current Operations Branch, (HQ AFPC/ DPSOOC), 550 C Street West, Suite 37, Ran-
   dolph Air Force Base, TX 78150-4737 before incorporating them into the supplement. DPSOOC
   approves all MAJCOM and FOA supplements. Ensures all are consistent with this instruction. Upon
   publication, send one copy and any changes to DPSOOC.
   7.2.3. Proposed ANG unit supplements are submitted through the state Adjutant General to the Air
   National Guard Readiness Center, NGB/DPF- FOC, for approval. Each unit sends a copy of its
   approved published supplement and changes to the appropriate Adjutant General and Air National
   Guard Bureau Readiness Center, Director for Personnel, upon publication.
