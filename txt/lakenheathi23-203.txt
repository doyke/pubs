This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive 23-2, Supplies and Materiel Management. The
purpose of this Instruction is to establish the functions and responsibilities of the Centralized Intermediate
Repair Facilities (CIRF). The CIRF will operate for only F-15C/D/E (Avionics, LANTIRN, and
F100-PW-220/229) and F-16 (LANTIRN Pods and F100-PW-100) units operating in the USAFE theater
of operation. The CIRF Customer Support Guide is available for customers and host supply accounts, and
provides specific requirements and operating instructions. AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter
21, USAFE Supplement 5 provides further guidance and lists all of the assets authorized repair under the
CIRF. This instruction applies to all organizations assigned to the 48th Fighter Wing, Royal Air Force
(RAF) Lakenheath, England, CIRF customers, and United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) F-15
host supply accounts. It does not apply to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) or Air National Guard
(ANG) units.



1. General Functions and Responsibilities.
   1.1. 48th Supply Squadron (SUPS) will:
       1.1.1. Establish and maintain Stock Record Account Number FB5437 and Routing Identifier
       Code DD3 on satellite account A1 for the USAFE F-15 CIRF.
       1.1.2. Segregate CIRF consolidated serviceable inventory (CSI) and consolidated reparable
       inventory (CRI) from 01 account.
       1.1.3. Manage and measure the effectiveness of the supply CIRF operations. The Combat Oper-
       ations Support Flight will be the primary point of contact for CIRF activity.
       1.1.4. Load approved stock numbers for the CIRF.
   1.2. Host Supply Accounts will ensure all Air Force Technical Order (AFTO) Forms 350, Reparable
   Item Processing Tags, are accurately completed to ensure reparable assets are issued to the correct
   organizational account at the CIRF. This action helps facilitate tracking of flying hour costs.
2                                                                        LAKI23-203 18 AUGUST 2000

    1.3. CIRF Supported Units will:
       1.3.1. Coordinate CIRF support requirements through USAFE/LGM to obtain initial/support
       instructions.
       1.3.2. Each unit submitting parts for maintenance to the CIRF is required to provide an Air Force
       (AF) Form 616 to separately account for their flying hour costs. Forward AF Form 616 to 48 LSS/
       LGLOR.
       1.3.3. 48 LSS/LGLOR will forward a data collection form to the deploying base to obtain infor-
       mation to load applicable organization codes and financial accounts. Once the AF Form 616 and
       data collection forms are received, Accounting will load the project funds management record
       (PFMR) and the USAFE Regional Supply Squadron (URSS) will load applicable organization
       codes. One organization code will be loaded on the RAF Lakenheath 01 system designator to
       order bits and pieces and one organization code will be loaded on the A1 system designator to
       credit the deployed unit's account when their Line Replacement Unit (LRU) is turned-in service-
       able.
    1.4. 48th Component Repair Squadron (CRS) will provide CIRF support for Avionics, Low Altitude
    Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN), and F100-PW-100/220/229 engines. They
    are responsible for ensuring a system is in-place to track deployed unit parts in the repair cycle in each
    shop. 48 CRS will use the AFTO Form 350 Tag to determine the correct organization account and AF
    Form 616, Fund Cite Authorization for tracking purposes.
    1.5. 48th Logistics Support Squadron (LSS) will:
       1.5.1. The 48 LSS/EME is responsible for ensuring a system is in-place to separately track
       engines from the deployed location to the repair shop for each unit.
       1.5.2. Coordinate engine asset processing with 48th Transportation Squadron Traffic Manage-
       ment Office (TMO).
    1.6. USAFE Regional Supply Support Squadron (URSS) provides Stock Control, Standard Base
    Supply System (SBSS) Computer Operations, and other supply support as necessary for the USAFE
    CIRF operation.
    1.7. 48th Transportation Squadron (TRANS) is the focal point to resolve transportation issues involv-
    ing the movement of repairable/serviceable assets to and from the CIRF.
