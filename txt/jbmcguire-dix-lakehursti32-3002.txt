1. General Information and Responsibilities.
     1.1. Installation Commanders may, on request from civil authorities, provide Explosive
     Ordnance Disposal (EOD) assistance in accordance with AFJI 32-3002, Interservice
     Responsibilities for Explosive Ordnance Disposal. The 87 ABW/CC delegates approval
     authority to the 87 MSG/CC to dispatch JBMDL EOD teams in response to emergency
     incidents off-base.
        1.1.1. JBMDL EOD assistance to civil authorities is normally limited to local
        communities and must not interfere with AMC mission.
     1.2. In accordance with AFI 32-3001, Explosive Ordnance Disposal Program, and AMCI
     32-3001, Air Mobility Command Explosive Ordnance Disposal, the closest EOD team
     (regardless of service) to an incident involving military or Federal agency ordnance (US or
     foreign) must respond immediately and take action to prevent or limit damage, injury, or loss
     of life. Using the fastest mode of transportation available, the EOD team should arrive at the
     scene as soon as possible (generally within 4 hours).
     1.3. Civil (state or local) authorities are primarily responsible for the safe handling and
     disposal of improvised explosive devices (IED), nonmilitary commercial explosives, or
     similarly dangerous articles outside DoD installations. The 87 ABW/CC may approve
     requests from civil authorities in this case when response is in the interest of public safety
     necessary to save lives, prevent human suffering, or mitigate great property damage.
     1.4. When the decision is made to provide assistance to civil authorities, the 87 CES/CC or a
     designee qualified to make the required on-scene command and risk decisions may be
     required to accompany the EOD team off-base. The 87 CES/CC may designate the EOD
     Flight Commander or Superintendent to fulfill this role.
     1.5. The 87th ABW Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) or other Judge Advocate General (JAG)
     Officer, will provide legal advice in order to avoid possible violations of the Posse Comitatus
     Act and to protect U.S. Air Force personnel and interests.
     1.6. The 87th ABW Public Affairs Office will handle media requests related to EOD
     responses as required.
2. Notification Procedures.
     2.1. Requests for EOD assistance from any off-base civil or military authorities will be
     referred to the JBMDL Command Post.
     2.1.1. Requests for EOD assistance on Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst property
     (McGuire AFB, Ft Dix, Lakehurst Naval Air Station) are considered ―on-base‖ and do not
JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTI32-3002 26 AUGUST 2011                                                   3


   require prior approval from chain-of-command. These requests will be routed through the
   JBMDL Command Post who will coordinate with the standby EOD technician and notify the
   chain-of-command as appropriate.
   2.2. The Command Post will record the necessary data and contact the primary EOD
   technician on standby.
   2.3. Upon receipt of the call, the standby EOD technician will notify the EOD Flight
   Commander/Superintendent, who will notify the 87 CES/CC.
   2.4. The Command Post will notify the 87 MSG/CC to request approval to respond. Once a
   decision is made, the Command Post will notify the standby EOD technician.
   2.5. The Command Post will send a GENADMIN report to HQ AMC Command Center
   within two hours of notification, per AFI 10-206, AMC Sup 1.
   2.6. If required, the senior EOD technician will contact the SJA or other JAG officer who
   will then contact the 87 MSG/CC to provide information on the legal aspects of EOD’s
   support to civil authorities. The on-call JAG officer will be reached through the JBMDL
   Command Post after duty hours.
   2.7. If required, the senior EOD technician will notify the 87th ABW Public Affairs Office
   to provide information regarding the nature of the response.
   2.8. The EOD team may request a Military Working Dog Team to accompany them off-
   base. This request will be channeled through the JBMDL Command Post for 87 MSG/CC
   approval. The Command Post will then notify the Law Enforcement Desk if support is
   approved.
3. Response Procedures.
   3.1. With the approval of the 87 MSG/CC, the JBMDL EOD team will respond to incident
   site.
   3.2. In accordance with AFI 32-3001, Explosive Ordnance Disposal Program, the senior
   EOD technician will coordinate with the on-scene commander to make a joint assessment
   and assign an incident risk category to the situation.
   3.3. The senior EOD technician will formulate a render safe procedure or a plan of action to
   abate the hazard and brief the on-scene commander, the command’s representative, or senior
   civilian authority on the proposed actions and possible damages that may occur. The plan of
   action should limit exposure of EOD personnel to risk of injury or loss of life, unless the
   threat to the civilian populace is so severe that the risk is clearly justified.
   3.4. Environmental considerations will be managed in accordance with AFI 32-3001
   Military Munitions Rule.
   3.5. Non-DoD toxic or hazardous materials (i.e. commercial explosives, homemade
   explosives, or non-military explosives used in IEDs) will not be taken to military installations
   for storage or disposal unless:
      3.5.1. The situation is deemed an emergency or lifesaving operation by the senior EOD
      technician and on-scene commander.
      3.5.2. Formal agreements exist with other Federal agencies.
 4                            JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTI32-3002 26 AUGUST 2011


     3.6. Once the primary standby team initiates the response, a backup EOD team will be
     placed on standby for joint-base support until the primary team returns.
4. After Action Procedures.
     4.1. Upon returning to JBMD, the EOD team chief will notify the Command Post, who will
     then debrief the 87 MSG/CC or designated representative on assistance provided.
     4.2. After completing the response, the EOD flight will prepare reports through Explosive
     Ordnance Disposal Information Management System (EODIMS) and forward to HQ AMC.
     4.3. EOD personnel subpoenaed to provide knowledgeable testimony will seek legal advice
     from the base legal office prior to appearing in court.
