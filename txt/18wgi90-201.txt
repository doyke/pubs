                                     GENERAL GUIDANCE

1.1. Policies.
     1.1.1. The 18 WG/XP is the OPR for local exercises and evaluations conducted under the
     authority of AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities, the PACAF supplement to AFI 90-
     201, and AFI 10-2501, AF Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and
     Operations.
     1.1.2. This document is effective for planning upon receipt. Supporting plans are not
     required; however, each unit should develop checklists, procedures, etc. as appropriate to
     support this instruction. This instruction is based on planning factors available at the time of
     preparation and is subject to modification during a specific exercise contingency. Letters of
     Instruction (LOIs) will be used to further script scenario constraints as necessary. The 18th
     Wing Commander (18 WG/CC) and 18 WG Command Staff may also issue Command Staff
     Directives (CSDs) for more precise scenario formulation. Additional documents such as
     PACAF Standard Simulations (PACAF Sims) and 18 WG approved simulations may
     supplement this instruction.
     1.1.3. Exercises will be conducted to evaluate the wing’s capability to perform its wartime
     mission and are based upon the wing’s Designed Operation Capability (DOC) statements,
     and higher headquarters (HHQ), Operations Plan (OPLAN), and Concept Plan (CONPLAN)
     taskings. In addition to major exercises, 18 WG/XP may conduct limited inspections of
     functional areas as directed by the 18 WG/CC. For example, an evaluation of mobility
     folders for a particular unit may be conducted outside of a mobility exercise.
     1.1.4. Exercise policies at a minimum will focus on competency of and compliance with the
     requirements listed in Kadena AB Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP)
     10-2, Contingency Response Plan (CRP), Kadena AB Installation Deployment Plan (IDP),
     Kadena AB In-Garrison Expeditionary Site Plan (IGESP), the Kadena AB Anti-Terrorism
     Plan, and 18th Medical Group (18 MDG) Medical Contingency Response Plan (MCRP).
     Exercises must evaluate and reinforce the capabilities to meet those requirements.
     Additional exercise requirements are listed in paragraph 1.4 and Chapters 3-4.
1.2. Objectives. The 18 WG exercise and inspection program is structured to meet the
following objectives:
     1.2.1. Provide realistic, integrated, large-scale training opportunities for 18 WG and partner
     units.
     1.2.2. Evaluate the wing’s performance and capability to respond, operate, and recover from
     combatant and noncombatant contingency operations and security threats.
     1.2.3. Maximize the benefits gained through exercises to improve mission readiness,
     enhance emergency management and crisis response, and enable units to master
     OPLAN/CONPLAN taskings.
     1.2.4. Report results and provide feedback to units and commanders for planning,
     preparation, and training purposes.

                  EXERCISE EVALUATION TEAM (EET) PROGRAM

2.1. EET Members.
   2.1.1. All EET members are trusted agents and will have access to privileged information
   regarding exercise planning. This information includes, but is not limited to: exercise start
   (STARTEX) times, scenarios, specific areas for evaluation, exercise end (ENDEX) times,
   etc. Divulging such information adversely affects exercise objectives and will result in
   removal from the EET and possible disciplinary action.
   2.1.2. EET members will be treated as XP members during exercises. It is essential that
   evaluators be cleared into restricted/controlled areas as quickly as possible without
   compromising security requirements. Once properly identified for access authority,
   evaluators are not to be restricted in their locations or actions within the restricted/controlled
   areas except in the interest of safety or security.
   2.1.3. EET members will not attempt to surreptitiously enter a restricted/controlled area
   through the use of bogus or other falsified identification. However, evaluators will otherwise
   take advantage of every opportunity to exploit lax security procedures. In so doing, EET
   members will not attempt to enter areas for which they do not possess clearance. See AFI
   31-301 for specifics.
2.2. EET Nomination/Responsibilities.
   2.2.1. Unit EET members are responsible for developing exercise scenarios based on unit
   needs, commander inputs, previous deficiencies, and as required to demonstrate critical
   combat processes. In addition, they are responsible for ensuring all deficiency responses
   appropriately answer report/evaluation deficiencies.
   2.2.2. Appointment of EET members.
      2.2.2.1. Mandatory membership is listed in AFI 10-2501, Installation Functional
      Support and CEMP Plan 10-2.
      2.2.2.2. Each Group Commander will identify an EET group lead. Group leads will be
      responsible for coordinating all exercise inputs within the group. In addition, they will
      work closely with their Group Commander to ensure all quarterly open deficiency
      responses from the group appropriately answer the deficiencies.
      2.2.2.3. Squadron Commanders will identify highly qualified unit personnel for
      assignment to the EET, including an EET unit lead. Personnel assigned to EET should
      have a minimum of one year remaining at Kadena to maintain continuity and sufficient
      availability to prevent large turnover rates before major inspections. Unit EET members
      will work as a team to ensure appropriate scenarios are developed for testing the unit
      mission.
      2.2.2.4. Personnel selected for assignment to the EET should attend initial training by 18
      WG/XP at least 30 days before utilization as an EET member.

      2.2.2.5. Units will forward a letter of appointment to 18 WG/XPE any time there is a
      change in EET membership. Each letter of appointment will list all team members
      currently assigned, team members being added, and those being relieved. Partner units
      are encouraged to participate in the 18 WG inspection process to include participation as
      EET members.
   2.2.3. EET members are responsible to the Chief of Wing Exercises/Warlord for planning,
   conducting, evaluating, and reporting the results of wing exercises. EET members are also
   required to validate deficiencies with and solicit ideas from Group and Squadron
   Commanders, OICs, and superintendents for areas requiring additional attention or re-
   evaluation.
2.3. EET Training Requirements.
   2.3.1. EET members will accomplish all applicable training IAW AFI 10-2501, Air Force
   Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations, Table 6.3. EET training
   consists of an initial training class, which is required, before duties as an evaluator are
   permitted. Training documents will be maintained by 18 WG/XPE IAW AFI 10-2501.
   2.3.2. Initial EET training is approximately 3 hours and covers the following topics:
      2.3.2.1. Chain of Command and personal responsibility.
      2.3.2.2. Rules of engagement and exercise ground rules when conducting an inspection.

      and smoke grenades. Safety maps and GBS drop zones will be established by the 18
      WG/XP office.
   2.3.3. Evaluators must be trained on the use of smoke and GBS before initial use per
   AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards, paragraph 7.26. The 18 WG/XPE office will
   maintain a list of EET members who have been trained with pyrotechnic devices.
   2.3.4. Additional training for EET members that will be tasked to evaluate Shelter
   Management Team (SMT), Contamination Control Team (CCT), and/or Emergency
   Operations Center (EOC) is required. Individual EET members will be responsible for
   acquiring the additional training and maintaining certifications. Reference AFI 10-2501 para.

   2.5.2. Dress Code for Evaluators. Members will wear Individual Protective Equipment
   (IPE) and field gear as directed by the Warlord. EET badges will be clearly displayed.
   2.5.3. Consider the safety of all operations. Location of smoke grenades and GBSs must be
   planned to minimize the possibility of creating hazards or obstructions to essential
   operations. Safety equipment will be readily available and, upon completion of the exercise,
   the site will be policed by EET for foreign objects and leftover debris.
   2.5.4. Effective establishment of a cordon area and evacuation of the area must be
   demonstrated within a reasonable length of time. Once objectives have been met, EET may
   direct the cordon be taken down. During inclement weather, personnel inside an effective
   cordon can be evacuated to a facility close by for safety purposes. Contractors working
   inside the cordon will not be evacuated.

                                          Chapter 3

                                  EXERCISE PLANNING

3.1. Operations to be Conducted.
   3.1.1. During LOREs, units within the 18 WG will be evaluated on their ability to prepare,
   mobilize, and deploy IAW selected OPLAN/CONPLAN and/or DOC statement(s). Units
   will also be evaluated on their ability to conduct combat operations using their Readiness
   Spares Packages (RSP), operate in a high-threat environment, and respond to simulated
   air/ground conventional, chemical, and biological attacks.
   3.1.2. Early phases of an exercise will primarily focus on Noncombatant Evacuation
   Operations    (NEO)/Okinawa       Area     Emergency     Evacuation    Plan    (OAEEP),
   mobility/deployment, reception of forces, and generation of combat airpower. Subsequent
   phases will shift to combat employment, force sustainment and the Ability to Survive and
   Operate (ATSO). Units will allocate resources to the pursuit of the mission objectives
   assigned by HHQ, 18 WG/CC, and as unit tactical circumstances dictate.
   3.1.3. Overall Exercise Construct. The 18 WG may be tasked to support a number of
   different contingencies. Regardless of the scenario, 18 WG training will focus on building
   and honing combat skills for all wing members as well as participating partner units. All 18
   WG members (deployed and non-deployed) participating in the exercise, as well as
   participating partner unit members, will respond to base Alarm Conditions and IPE uniform
   requirements and all command directives issued from the Kadena ICC. Unless otherwise
   directed, the wing will use a fight-the-base exercise environment to maximize training (see
   paragraph 4.6 for information on other scenarios). All exercise participants will be tasked by
   one of three methods:
      3.1.3.1. Units Deploying Via the Relevant OPLAN/CONPLAN Time-Phased Force
      Deployment Data (TPFDD). Personnel and equipment will deploy to their designated
      location (simulated) and start operations out of their ―deployed‖ operating location at
      Kadena. Due to manpower constraints, the ―deployed‖ unit will still receive and respond
      to all directions from the Kadena ICC.
      3.1.3.2. DOC Statement Taskings. Units not scheduled to deploy as part of relevant
      OPLAN/CONPLAN TPFFD but given DOC statement deployment tasking (Flexible
      Deterrent Option, etc.) will proceed through the mobility process (cargo build-
      up/marshal/load/personnel processing) and upon completion of cargo load and/or take-off
      time for deployment mission, will return to their garrison facilities on Kadena and operate
      in place at Kadena for the remainder of the exercise.
      3.1.3.3. Other members who remain in garrison for the directed OPLAN/CONPLAN will
      operate from their Kadena garrison facilities and must consider their unit within the threat
      ring of the anticipated enemy.
   3.1.4. NEO/OAEEP/SAFE HAVEN.               The 18 WG may be tasked to execute
   NEO/OAEEP/SAFE HAVEN operations either separate from or in conjunction with the
   other mission objectives depending on the scenario set by the 18 WG/XP.
18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                  17


  3.1.5. Mobility/Deployment. The 18 WG may be tasked to mobilize and deploy IAW KAB
  IDP via an exercise TPFDD, Flexible Deterrent Option (FDO), or as directed by the 18
  WG/XP.
     3.1.5.1. All tasked equipment and support personnel on the exercise TPFDD will be
     provided by the respective work centers at Kadena; real-world taskings and shortfalls
     must be considered. Common sense and good faith efforts to operate IAW the IGESP
     and TPFDD are expected while applying this instruction. 18 WG personnel deployed for
     real-world taskings (AEF, TDY) and on leave status will not be counted as available for
     the exercise and must be backfilled or shortfalled if they are unable to contribute to
     mission accomplishment from their deployed location. 18 WG will demonstrate
     personnel actions to backfill personnel shortfalls or secure return of members in TDY,
     AEF, or leave status.
     3.1.5.2. The 18 WG Command Staff will coordinate shortfalls with simulated HHQ
     (13 AF, 5 AF, 7 AF as required) following receipt of the exercise TPFDD. ―White Cell‖
     may suspense 18 WG for shortfalls through message traffic over secure media.
     3.1.5.3. Deploying Assets. Any mobilized equipment, supplies, or personnel will be
     isolated after takeoff time of their respective simulated airlift mission for the duration of
     the simulated flight as required by the scenario.
  3.1.6. Generation of Combat Airpower. Generation taskings will normally mirror those of
  the OPLAN/CONPLAN being exercised, and will be graded IAW the PACAF supplement to
  AFI 90-201. Off-station aircraft will normally be shortfalled and not counted as generated
  (may be counted as generated assets at XP discretion and if MOC can demonstrate a Code 1
  FMC capability at their deployed location). Depending on the scenario and Desired Learning
  Objectives (DLO), the 18 WG/XP may elect to adjust the number of tasked aircraft.
  3.1.7. Reception of Forces. The 18 WG units will be prepared to demonstrate all aspects of
  the reception and beddown of inbound forces, equipment, and aircraft as dictated by the
  exercise TPFDD- or XP-directed scenario. Inbound personnel may be simulated using XP
  augmentees. 18 WG will supply both rolling stock and palletized cargo to be used for
  exercise reception IAW the PACAF supplement to AFI 90-201 or 18 WG/XP directives.
  3.1.8. Combat Employment. Forces will be utilized IAW the plan being implemented or as
  directed by ATO. Simultaneous employment operations from Kadena Air Base and the
  simulated deployed locations may occur.
  3.1.9. Defense of the Base. Base defense scenarios consisting of both on- and off-base
  threats may be incorporated into the exercise scenario. Simulated attacks by ground forces
  may be exercised at any time during the exercise.
  3.1.10. Forces Assigned. Operations will be conducted utilizing those forces assigned to the
  18 WG and any forces agreeing to participate and designated for augmentation in the specific
  plan being executed.
  3.1.11. Supporting Instructions. Each unit/work center is encouraged to publish instructions
  or a Concept of Operations (CONOPS) supporting this document. These CONOPS will be
  closely aligned with the baseline instructions and should be referenced during exercise
  operations.
 18                                                     18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012


3.2. Special Events. During each LORE, the 18 OG may support exercise events (e.g., Aircrew
Extractions, Barrier Engagement, and Aircrew Decontamination) that require special
coordination to ensure proper execution. Dates and times for these events should be coordinated
by EET/XP using the Master Sequence of Events Listing (MSEL) or CSD. A list of sample
requirements for each group/unit is located in Attachment 4.
3.3. Scenario Development.
   3.3.1. 18 WG/XP will:
       3.3.1.1. Coordinate and gain approval from 18 WG/CC or CV on the proposed date and
       timeline for the exercise.
       3.3.1.2. Determine primary exercise objectives in conjunction with EET group leads and
       owning agencies by reviewing taskings, procedures in applicable OPLANs and
       CONPLANs, previous exercise reports, Air Force SIIs, PACAF CIIs, and deficiencies
       from other bases.
       3.3.1.3. Determine a basic scenario IAW AFI 10-2501, Air Force EM Program Planning
       and Operations, Table 7.1 that will satisfy the objectives.
       3.3.1.4. Coordinate with the MDG EET lead to determine the number and type of
       simulated casualties and Self-Aid Buddy Care (SABC) events. Task groups to provide
       the number of casualties required.
       3.3.1.5. Coordinate with the Civil Engineer Readiness (CEX) EET lead to develop
       attack/exercise scenarios for all wing exercises (meteorological data for attacks, type of
       agent, method of delivery, type of release, hazard footprint and persistency).
       3.3.1.6. Convene SWG as necessary to develop the scenario, refine objectives, and build
       the MSEL.
       3.3.1.7. Ensure no exercise prop will cause a Foreign Object Debris (FOD) hazard.
   3.3.2. Group EET Leads will:
       3.3.2.1. Assist 18 WG/XP with development of exercise scenarios appropriate to their
       Group responsibilities.
       3.3.2.2. Act as the focal point for their Group. Group leads will also be responsible for
       providing exercise players as tasked by 18 WG/XP.
       3.3.2.3. Attend all SWG and exercise planning meetings and all EET meetings during
       exercises.
   3.3.3. Team Members will:
       3.3.3.1. Provide inputs for their portion of the exercise. Team members are responsible
       for ensuring scripts contain appropriate inputs to complete exercise objectives. Scenario
       inputs will be due to the Warlord by the established suspense, normally, a minimum of 2
       weeks before the exercise.
       3.3.3.2. The 18 WG/CP senior member on duty is responsible for arranging the use of
       the base Giant Voice system.
18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                   19


       3.3.3.3. Unit EET leads and assigned EET members will develop and maintain detailed
       checklists for their respective area of evaluation to specifically evaluate locally
       established procedures contained in applicable OPLANs and other local CONPLANs.
       3.3.3.4. Unit EET leads will coordinate all unit EET activities, attend all EET meetings
       during exercises, and attend SWG and exercise planning meetings as appropriate for the
       scenario.
   3.3.4. The 18 WG XP/XPE and EET will develop exercise scenario ground rules to ensure
   scenarios are designed to simulate the stress and pressure that would occur during a real
   incident.
   3.3.5. There are many attack response exercises that will be conducted to test the wing’s
   ability to survive, operate, and recover from the effects of attacks by hostile forces. These
   attacks may range from terrorist activities and sabotage to acts of general war. Exercise
   attack situations will be built around a credible intelligence scenario that accurately portrays
   the potential enemy threat in our area of operation. Exercises are intended to provide as
   much realism as possible. The following resources and munitions will be used to enhance
   exercise situations.
   3.3.6. Red Air/Faker Aircraft. When available, aircraft will be used to conduct air attacks
   against Kadena based aircraft. If outside agency assistance is unavailable, simulated attacks
   will be added to the scenario.
   3.3.7. Infiltrators. Inspection team members and augmentees may be used as perpetrators
   during infiltrator exercises. In these instances EET will not surreptitiously use their
   credentials as an EET member to allow access or confuse personnel attempting to apprehend
   them. Where possible, EET should use a third party to play infiltrators.
   3.3.8. EET personnel that require GBS/smoke for their input will coordinate with 18 WG/XP
   during SWG meetings. Smokes will be placed in a can when in high concrete areas (i.e., CP
   Building, Fitness Center, Clinic).
   3.3.9. Damaged/Destroyed/Contaminated Status Labels. EET input damage forms will be
   used to designate damaged, destroyed, or contaminated facilities, equipment, vehicles, areas.
   A brief narrative description will be included to clarify exact damage, destruction or
   contamination. Attrition information and fire fighting information will also be posted, as
   applicable.
   3.3.10. Simulated Casualties (wounded or dead). Moulage is the preferred method of
   simulated casualties. When moulage is not possible, inject cards will be used to identify
   casualties. Casualties should not be confused with personnel attrited for improper IPE or
   inadequate attack response. All casualty requests must be coordinated through MDG EET.
   3.3.11. Simulated UXOs. Inert munitions used to simulate UXOs will be supplied by 18
   CES/CED to the XP White Cell via the deliverables document. All UXOs must be signed
   out via a hand receipt.
3.3.12. Simulated Craters.Bomb/rockets craters will be marked on runways, taxiways, and
parking aprons with traffic cones. Cones can be used to mark craters in the middle of the
taxiway providing aircraft are not taxiing and airfield management is notified through proper
command channels. Airfield management will decide whether to close taxiway. Aircraft and
 20                                                      18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012


vehicles will not be allowed to traverse through simulated craters. Vehicles operating within
coned off areas may become disabled based on EET on-scene determination.
   3.3.13. Chemical Agent Simulation. PACAF Standard Simulations guide, Simulated Use of
   Real-World M8 Chemical Agent Detection Paper and M9 Detection Agent, Sim 2.18, will be
   utilized to provide a suitable material to be used as M-8 or M-9 paper to show chemical agent
   presence. Simulated materials will be created by EET members and used in areas subjected
   to chemical attacks. Chemical monitoring, decontamination and contamination avoidance
   procedures should be implemented in these areas.
   3.3.14. Communication Outages. Throughout the exercise, various communications systems
   will be removed to see the wing’s capability for back-up systems. COMM-OUT procedures
   will be carried out until sufficient procedures have been followed to restore communications.
   During COMM-OUT procedures, great care will be taken to avoid emergency lines such as
   911, and critical real-world command and control hubs such as Command Post Emergency
   Action (EA) Cell.
18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                  21


                                           Chapter 4

                                 EXERCISE PROCEDURES

4.1. Safety and Security.
   4.1.1. All participants share responsibility to ensure exercise operations are conducted safely
   and that security is not compromised. If a safety or security violation appears imminent,
   immediate action must be taken to prevent injury to personnel, inadvertent release of
   classified information, or damage to equipment. Should an actual accident/incident occur, or
   if someone is injured during the exercise, delay or put on hold that portion of the exercise
   while appropriate action is taken.
   4.1.2. Depending on the nature of the accident and/or injuries, if participants deem it
   necessary to put the exercise on hold, they will transmit the following message over
   appropriate communication channels ―REAL WORLD, KNOCK IT OFF, KNOCK IT OFF,
   KNOCK IT OFF.‖
   4.1.3. The 18 WG/XP should be notified of safety and/or security incidents immediately
   through Command Post or other channels. If the severity of the incident warrants, 18
   WG/XP may terminate the exercise after consulting wing leadership.
4.2. OPSEC/COMSEC/COMPUSEC. OPSEC/COMSEC are a must and are graded items
during LOREs and HHQ inspections.
   4.2.1. Digital Encryption System (DES). DES-equipped radios are not cleared for
   transmitting classified information. Personnel needing to discuss classified activities must
   use an operational/keyed Secure Terminal Equipment (STE) or Voice over Secure Internet
   Protocol (VoSIP). Exercise/wartime flying schedules will be transmitted via secure means
   Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet), Theater Battle Management Core
   System – Unit Level (TBMCS-UL), or Tactical Aircrew Scheduling and Airspace
   Management System (TASAMS).
   4.2.2. Critical Information (CI). CI is information about friendly operations and activities
   which, individually or when pieced together, reveals sensitive details about capabilities and
   intentions. It requires protection from external collection and exploitation. CI should never
   be discussed over non-secure telephones, in public places, or anywhere that might lead to
   unwarranted disclosure. Follow published guidance from the OPSEC program office on
   handling procedures for CI.
4.3. Communications.
   4.3.1. All radio, telephone, message, and report communications required for the purpose of
   exercise realism will begin and end with the word ―EXERCISE.‖ Exercise inject cards are
   developed accordingly. If it is necessary to interject an actual message, use the appropriate
   phrase, ―THIS IS A REAL WORLD_________ (event).‖
   4.3.2. Reports. Required operational reports (voice and message) such as OPREPs,
   SITREPs, etc. will be prepared, but not transmitted. Prepared reports will be given to the
   EET member evaluating the functional area submitting the report or will be sent via e-mail to
 22                                                     18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012


   the XP ―White Cell‖. Additionally, the events log in the EOC and other base control centers
   will be made available for review after the exercise.
   4.3.3. Messages. All message traffic that would normally be dispatched during the exercise
   will be sent via 18 WG/XP ―White Cell‖. Functional areas are responsible for submitting
   their own messages and should not use command post to transmit them. The command post
   only needs to be courtesy copied on the messages sent. All reports must be routed through
   the appropriate chain of command prior to being released to the 18 WG/XP ―White Force‖
   (HHQ). The release chain for messages goes from the duty section to the Squadron
   Commander, then forwarded to the Group Commander, once approved by Group
   Commander, he/she releases through the EOC to 18 WG/XP ―White Cell‖. These reports
   will not be sent off-base.
4.4. Exercise Execution. The 18th Wing exercises responding to scenarios ranging from an
increase in readiness posture to full-scale employment operations.
   4.4.1. Exercise Initiation. 18 WG/XP will initiate all exercises. Unit team leads are
   responsible for managing their respective areas of evaluation and may take initiatives as they
   see fit within the guidelines of the scenarios, sequence of events, and ground rules.
   4.4.2. Exercise Actions. Actions directed by these instructions will commence upon receipt
   of a HHQ inspection, exercise alerting, warning message, or when directed by the 18
   WG/CC.
      4.4.2.1. Command and Control (C2). The Kadena ICC will stand up at the direction of
      the 18 WG/CC in the 18 WG Command Post.
      4.4.2.2. Specific ICC functions such as the Crisis Action Team (CAT), EOC and Unit
      Control Centers (UCCs) will stand up at the direction of the 18 WG/CC IAW Kadena Air
      Base Instruction 10-2501, Installation Control Center Operations.
4.5. Ground Rules.
   4.5.1. IPE/Field Gear. Exercise players will assume the IPE configuration directed by CSD.
   IPE and field gear will be marked and have M9 properly placed IAW AFPAM 10-100,
   Airman’s Manual, page 27 and 28, and as directed by CSD. Variations to uniform wear
   requirements, due to weather conditions or other reasons, will be approved by the 18 WG/CC
   and also published via CSD.
   4.5.1.1. Personnel will use training CWDE gear during the exercise to simulate use of the
   real-world C-1 bag (bags may be palletized depending on scenario).
      4.5.1.2. Emergency-essential civilian employees will comply with the same field gear
      and IPE requirements. Non-emergency essential civilians are exempt.
      4.5.1.3. Civilians who deploy with units must wear appropriate IPE as directed by the
      deployed installation commander.
      4.5.1.4. Contractor personnel deploying with US Armed Forces must wear appropriate
      IPE as prescribed by DODI 3020.41, paragraph 6.2.7.6, and their respective Performance
      Work Statement.
      4.5.1.5. During a Base X scenario, Kadena personnel deployed to Base X will don
      IPE/field gear upon arrival at Base X. They will also wear appropriate Mission Oriented
18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                              23


     Protective Posture (MOPP) gear for the current MOPP level, which will be briefed upon
     arrival at Base X. For ease of identification, IPE gear will differentiate personnel
     deployed to Base X from Kadena personnel during Phase I.
  4.5.2. Exercise Participation – Players and Non-Players.
     4.5.2.1. Emergency Response Personnel. Emergency response personnel are exempt
     from exercise participation for the duration of the emergency. The 18 WG EET members
     will in no way hinder or delay responding emergency personnel.
     4.5.2.2. Commanders will ensure maximum participation by unit personnel.
     4.5.2.3. Members unable to assume full IPE and MOPP levels will be non-players in the
     exercise or inspection unless coordinated through their respective group CC and
     approved by 18 WG/XP. These members may serve as augmentees to the XP team
     according to their profile restrictions.
     4.5.2.4. Personnel in-processing or out-processing the base, in conjunction with a PCS
     are exempt from play, and will wear blues to their appointments to signify their non-
     player status.
     4.5.2.5. The 18 WG members returning from AEF deployments are exempt from play
     during post-deployment relief and compensation time.
     4.5.2.6. Partner unit members across the base who are not participating in the exercise
     will remain in their duty uniform.
     4.5.2.7. 18 WG members in duty uniform, but in an approved no-play facility, are
     exempt from responding to exercise injects, alarm conditions, or uniform/IPE changes.
     The no-play facility listing will be posted on the XP SharePoint site prior to each LORE.
     4.5.2.8. For LOREs conducted while PME is in session, all students at NCOA, ALS,
     FTD, and FTAC are exempt from play. When PME is not in session, instructors will
     participate as players in the exercise.
     4.5.2.9. Non-Player Identification. Members not participating in the exercise include a
     significant portion of the population of Kadena AB. Non-player personnel will be
     recognized by the following:
         4.5.2.9.1. Civilian clothes
         4.5.2.9.2. USAF ―Blues‖
         4.5.2.9.3. Other service uniforms
     4.5.2.10. Members participating in the exercise will be identifiable by IPE gear, utility
     uniforms, and location in a mission-related duty area. The 18 WG/CC will coordinate
     with partner units to request minimal presence of non-players in the 18 WG play area.
  4.5.3. Play/No-Play Areas.
     4.5.3.1. All facilities on Kadena are normally considered play areas with exceptions
     noted below. During Phase II of a Base X scenario, facilities within the confines of Base
     X are considered play areas. The following facilities will be no-play areas at all times:
         4.5.3.1.1. DoDDS Facilities
24                                                      18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012


         4.5.3.1.2. Designated Medical Treatment Areas in the Clinic
         4.5.3.1.3. Child Development Centers
         4.5.3.1.4. Partner Unit Facilities (when not participating)
         4.5.3.1.5. Designated facilities approved by group CCs with 18 WG/XP concurrence
         4.5.3.1.6. Boeing V2 Operations Building
     4.5.3.2. Members will not be required to respond to exercise/inspection events within the
     confines of an approved No-Play Area, unless in a designated Play facility. The areas
     south of Douglas Blvd and southwest of McKennon Ave (north of Douglas Blvd,
     including the golf course and the Washington Heights/Clark Vista housing areas) are No-
     Play Areas for ATSO events. 18 WG/XP will maintain a list of Play facilities within the
     No-Play Area. No-Play facilities within the play area will be kept to an absolute
     minimum. Operational requirements or the diverse customer needs of these locations
     precipitate their No-Play status.
     4.5.3.3. Personnel who work at a Play facility outside the Play Area will don the
     appropriate MOPP gear based on the information they had leaving their home and/or
     upon entering the base. NBC Reconnaissance Teams will not respond to attacks outside
     the play area; however, individual Play facilities will perform the necessary post-attack
     actions and reporting. Furthermore, the Kadena ICC will maintain and report current
     MOPP levels for the No-Play Areas.
     4.5.3.4. Work areas which include only non-emergency-essential civilians and Master
     Labor Contract (MLC) employees will be treated as uninhabited facilities. If exercise
     mission requirements (i.e., bugout) drive uniformed members to work in one of these
     facilities, they will be required to sweep the building, post signage and M-8 stands as
     appropriate. When establishing operations in these facilities after the base has
     experienced a simulated attack during a period of simulated chemical weapons threat,
     uniformed personnel will assume the 10/24 rule is in effect until verification is received
     of no chemical attack in that sector and/or NBC Reconnaissance Teams verify the
     building is not contaminated. Facilities which fit this category are still deemed as Play
     Areas.
     4.5.3.5. Boeing V2 Operations contractors and visiting personnel working in the V2 ops
     building will be allowed to park their official government, contractor, and POVs in the
     parking lot adjacent to V2 ops building. They are exempt from configuring their vehicles
     for the exercise scenarios. Visiting personnel escorted by Boeing V2 personnel will be
     allowed unimpeded access to their flight line operations in the V2 ops building. To avoid
     unnecessary delays for these personnel, ECP monitors should be made aware of their
     presence via EAL.
  4.5.4. Personnel Entering/Exiting Play.
     4.5.4.1. Members will update base field status before arriving at their duty sections using
     any available means, to include:
         4.5.4.1.1. Commander’s Action Channel (CAC) for on-base personnel with cable
         television access
18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                25


        4.5.4.1.2. Base status signs located at the installation gates for off-base personnel
        without access to the CAC
        4.5.4.1.3. Phone calls to their duty section prior to departing for their shift when
        practical
        4.5.4.1.4. Passing the transition points that define the ―Play‖ area
     4.5.4.2. All 18 WG personnel will enter the play area through MOPP transition points.
     Due to inadequate parking facilities at those transition points, personnel will continue to
     their duty section regardless of current Alarm/MOPP condition and park their POV.
     After parking their POV, personnel will expeditiously don the appropriate field and/or
     IPE gear for the current Alarm/MOPP condition. Members may drive to work in UOD,
     AF PT Gear, or the BDO/CPO, as determined by 18 WG/CC, to facilitate the donning
     process. After donning the appropriate field and/or IPE gear, proceed as follows:
        4.5.4.2.1. For personnel with operational air conditioners in their vehicles, the
        following rules apply upon arrival at their duty section: If the sector is in Alarm
        BLUE/RED or BLACK MOPP 4, lower the window slightly then turn off car and air
        conditioner for 5 minutes to demonstrate MOPP proficiency. After 5 minutes,
        member may turn on car and air conditioner (while remaining in appropriate MOPP)
        until Alarm GREEN. After Alarm GREEN is declared the member is cleared to
        assume the new MOPP for their sector and proceed into work (if in doubt proceed in
        MOPP 4 until able to verify status). If there is no MOPP level, personnel will remain
        in their car until Alarm GREEN.
        4.5.4.2.2. For personnel without operational air conditioners in their vehicles, the
        following rules apply upon arrival at their duty section: If the sector is in Alarm
        BLUE/RED or BLACK MOPP 4, members will exit their vehicle, expeditiously don
        appropriate MOPP gear and proceed into their place of work, sweeping for UXOs.
        Members will use shuffle boxes and decontaminate the door prior to using
        sign/countersign or another identity verification procedure to gain entrance into the
        building. If there is no MOPP level, members will exit their vehicle, expeditiously
        don field gear and proceed into their place of work, sweeping for UXOs.
     4.5.4.3. 18 WG personnel will remain at their duty station until Alarm GREEN.
     Personnel may then depart while adhering to the current MOPP level, 10/24 rule if
     applicable, and proceed to their POV, if used. Comply with the requirements in
     paragraph 4.5.5, POV Play.
  4.5.5. POV Play.
     4.5.5.1. Members will minimize use of POVs to the maximum extent possible for official
     duties. While operating POV, 18 WG members will not respond to airfield attack cues.
     Additionally, members will not operate POVs in MOPP 4 to minimize risk of vehicle
     accidents and injury to personnel.
     4.5.5.2. POV Contamination.
        4.5.5.2.1. To mark a vehicle as contaminated, an EET or XP member will tape M-8
        paper with simulated contamination to the vehicle windshield using scotch tape or
26                                                      18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012


         masking tape (not duct tape) or the EET or XP member will inform the individual that
         the POV has been contaminated.
         4.5.5.2.2. Personnel leaving work during Alarm GREEN or YELLOW MOPP-2,
         who find their POV contaminated, will move at least 10 feet away from their POV,
         don MOPP-4 gear, and demonstrate an operational decon of the POV. Additionally,
         personnel must be prepared to describe required follow-on actions, such as filling out
         the STANAG marker, marking the vehicle and applying the 10/24 rule if the POV is
         still going to be used. After all steps are completed to the satisfaction of EET/XP
         personnel, EET/XP will terminate the task-eval. The POV will no longer be
         considered contaminated and will be available for normal use.
         4.5.5.2.3. Personnel leaving work during Alarm GREEN or YELLOW MOPP-4 who
         find their POV contaminated will begin with the operational decon of their POV and
         then proceed as outlined in the previous paragraph. Additionally, if members are
         leaving a facility in MOPP-4 due to Phase I of the 10/24 rule, it is recommended they
         remain in MOPP-4 until confirming that their POV is not contaminated.
         4.5.5.2.4. If no EET/XP member is visibly present, Airmen will complete all steps
         through the operational decon. If there is still no EET/XP present at this point, then
         Airmen may consider the task-eval terminated, doff MOPP gear (assuming their shift
         has ended), and depart in their POV.
  4.5.6. Bugout Procedures. Each 18 WG unit will identify an alternate facility to which
  personnel will ―bugout‖ in the event of simulated damage to their primary operating location.
  Units will ensure that these facilities are appropriate for the accomplishment of their mission
  and will coordinate use of these facilities prior to the start of a LORE/ORI. Upon arrival at
  the alternate facility, units will establish an ECP and take accountability. UCCs will notify
  the EOC of their alternate location as soon as possible after a bugout occurs.
  4.5.7. Services Facilities. Services facilities will normally be placed off limits for on-duty
  exercise participants upon direction of the 18 WG/CC. After issuance of off-limits order,
  participating exercise members will be restricted from all services facilities while in uniform
  to sanitize No-Play Areas to the max extent possible (Dining Facilities, Child Development
  Centers (CDC), and DoD schools (DoDDS), are notable exceptions). Members desiring to
  visit services facilities will do so after changing into civilian clothes at their quarters.
     4.5.7.1. Members will obtain their meals during duty periods from base dining halls,
     ―brown bag,‖ or MREs pre-staged in the dining halls for purchase. No food deliveries or
     ―food-runs‖ to services facilities will be allowed while members are on duty.
     4.5.7.2. The 18 WG warriors will maintain singular focus on demonstrating their combat
     skills in a contingency setting by allocating the bulk of their time to their work center, a
     dining facility, or quarters.
  4.5.8. Master Labor Contract Employees and ATSO Play. MLC workers on Kadena
  comprise a significant portion of the workforce. For instance, aircrew transportation is
  manned by MLC drivers. These members will continue to serve during exercises although
  they do not have IPE/field gear or receive ATSO training due to political sensitivities and
  contractual issues. As inbound forces arrive, IAW the exercise TPFDD, these forces would
  be used to fill driver requirements and MLCs would be placed on administrative leave.
18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                  27


   4.5.9. Attrition Procedures.
      4.5.9.1. In addition to simulated combat deaths and injuries planned during the exercise
      scenario, EET/XP members may identify additional personnel whose actions could result
      in death or injury during an actual conflict. These individuals may be designated as
      simulated deaths or attrition. Some example reasons for attrition are failure to wear
      MOPP gear properly, lack of a sense of urgency, violating CSDs, and/or safety
      violations.
      4.5.9.2. EET members will record the following information: name, rank, squadron,
      phone number, and time and date of infraction. Violator names will be immediately
      provided to the XP work center and the 18th Wing Exercise Attrition form will be filled
      out and turned into White Cell. This attrition form can be located on the XP SharePoint
      site via Attrition Card.
      4.5.9.3. Personnel attrited by EET members will be treated as either injured or deceased
      (via attrition card) and processed through the medical facility and/or morgue appropriate
      to their respective injury. Attrited personnel will be transported by their unit to all
      required locations.
      4.5.9.4. Once attrited personnel have processed through the medical facility, and/or
      morgue, they will report to the 18 WG/XP work center (White Cell) for duty until the end
      of their shift. The 18 WG/XP may use attrited personnel in an augmentee capacity to
      process through the Casualty Collection Area/Decontamination Line or perform other
      required tasks. Upon conclusion of their shift, attrited personnel will report to their unit
      commander to relay the details of their attrition. Attrited individuals will not usually
      perform normal duties until their next shift.
4.6. LOREs with Base X Implementation.
   4.6.1. Base X Scenario. In the event the 18 WG is tasked with a cadre/ADVON deployment
   scenario, an isolation area (Base X) may be directed. This exercise construct remains a
   viable simulation to be employed at the discretion of the 18 WG/CC. Under a Base X
   scenario, the wing will utilize Exercise Entry Points (EEP) and direct individual units who
   deploy to establish a deployed operating location different than their garrison facility on
   Kadena. In the event of an exercise involving Base X, 18 WG/XP will publish an LOI
   delineating the boundaries of Base X and specifying in-place facilities and assets. 18
   WG/XP may request group commanders to submit lists of assumed in-place assets for
   approval prior to the exercise. These lists should be based on the IGESP for the OPLAN
   being exercised. Units which do not deploy in the scenario will continue to operate from
   their garrison locations at Kadena.
   4.6.2. General Base X CONOPS. The 18 WG will deploy cadre to prepare the Base X play
   area for exercise/inspection operations. The cadre operates according to PACAFI 10-405
   and has the following general responsibilities:
      4.6.2.1. Contact host nation/USAF caretakers and Collocated Operating Base (COB)
      staff for the base and accept responsibility for facilities and assets. For Base X, this
      means contacting the COB staff to receive listings and locations of in-place assets.
28                                                     18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012


     4.6.2.2. Establish initial command and control at the deployed location, including
     contacting HHQ and host nation counterparts as defined in applicable OPLANs. For
     exercise purposes, cadre members will contact White Cell to simulate those contacts.
     4.6.2.3. Activate facilities and beddown arriving forces. The cadre receives, in-
     processes, beds down, and integrates incoming forces into the deployed AEW structure.
     Cadre operations emphasize turning over operations to incoming forces as soon as
     enough people have been deployed to sustain operations. Once that point has been
     reached, the cadre assimilates into the deployed wing organization unless tasked to re-
     deploy as required by the cadre/CC and 18 AEW/CC. The cadre also prepares the base
     for hostilities, including initiating logistics plans for weapons systems operating from the
     deployed location. It also includes initiating planning actions for air base ground defense
     and passive defense procedures.
  4.6.3. Command and Control. For LOREs in which a cadre/ADVON team forward deploys,
  the wing will normally use two separate ICC agencies during Phase I/II.
     4.6.3.1. Phase I. Deploying units will follow command directives from the Kadena ICC
     until arriving at their deployed location. At that time, the deployed units will follow
     command direction from the simulated Base X ICC. Units remaining at Kadena will
     continue to follow command guidance from the Kadena ICC.
  4.6.4. Base X deployment. Any aircraft returning from a simulated deployment mission will
  be recovered and placed in Base X under control of Base X maintenance, Maintenance
  Readiness Center, and Base X operations. Any deploying personnel who arrive at Base X
  prior to Phase II will wear IPE/field gear and assume MOPP and alarm conditions for Base X
  as directed by the deployed command post and will limit face-to-face interaction with in-
  garrison personnel in the conduct of their mission activities.
     4.6.4.1. Example 1 – Unit Deployment under Base X: An OG flying unit tasked to
     deploy in an OPLAN will pick up and move to an alternative facility on Kadena and will
     establish operations from that new facility after logistics movement is complete. The
     deployed unit will follow direction of the Base X ICC during Phase I and II.
     4.6.4.2. Example 2 – Partial Unit Deployment under Base X: An 18 CS UTC tasked to
     deploy in an OPLAN will pick up and move to an alternative facility at Base X and will
     establish operations from that new facility after logistics movement is complete. The
     deployed section will follow direction of the Base X ICC. The remaining members of the
     18th CS will stay in place at their Kadena facility and operate under the direction of the
     Kadena ICC throughout the entire exercise. They will respond to all Alarm Conditions
     and IPE changes as directed by the Kadena ICC.
  4.6.5. EEP Use. During deployment scenarios in which the 18 WG/CC does not elect to
  follow a FTB construct, EEPs will be utilized to enter and exit Base X during employment
  operations.
     4.6.5.1. All EEPs will be manned to control access in/out of the play area. The 18
     MSG/CEM will be responsible for preparing, manning, and equipping all EEPs. 18
     MSG/MDG/SFS will provide the following personnel/equipment to support requirements
     for establishing and manning EEPs and restricted entry/exit points.
18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                               29


        4.6.5.1.1. MSG:   Dayshift (0600-1800) two SNCOs (supervisor) and five
        Airmen/NCOs to man EEP 1. A minimum of two Airmen/NCOs to man all other
        EEPs. Manning will be adjusted as required.
        4.6.5.1.2. MDG:   Nightshift (1800-0600) two SNCOs (supervisor) and five
        Airmen/NCOs to man EEP 1. A minimum of two Airmen/NCOs to man all other
        EEPs. Manning will be adjusted as required.
        4.6.5.1.3. The 18 SFS will provide portable ―gate shacks‖ for the intersection of
        Fairchild Blvd and Collison Ave. The 18 SFS will man the gate shack during the
        entire exercise.
        4.6.5.1.4. MSG/MDG will provide EEP augmentee names and phone numbers to 18
        MSG/CEM NLT 1200, 2 weeks prior to STARTEX.
     4.6.5.2. Vehicle Pass Control and Accountability.
        4.6.5.2.1. Base X military vehicle availability is based upon assets authorized and
        assigned on the Base X Vehicle Authorization List as well as military vehicles on
        inbound UTCs. Units will provide all vehicles involved in Base X exercises. The
        Base X 18 LRS vehicle representative and unit VCOs maintain current authorized and
        assigned listings for all functional areas.
        4.6.5.2.2. All vehicles on Base X must have a pass issued by 18 LRS upon initiation
        of Phase II. Passes are controlled items and units will send a representative to sign
        for passes when they deploy to Base X. Passes must be returned to 18 LRS
        immediately after ENDEX. Passes will be issued based on the Base X Vehicle
        Authorization List; however, units may use reasonable substitutes and asset
        realignments that reflect real-world capabilities. The 18 WG/XP will make the final
        determination on any disputed substitutions. Base X vehicle passes will be randomly
        checked to ensure only approved assets are used. Units should request vehicle passes
        at the earliest possible date, but NLT 1500 hours 3 workdays prior to STARTEX.
        Submit vehicle pass requirements to the cadre Transportation Representative.
        4.6.5.2.3. Each unit is provided with two types of vehicle passes, restricted and
        unrestricted. All passes must be used IAW the guidelines listed below. The 18 WG/
        XP will resolve questions pertaining to the type of passes to be issued. The following
        types of vehicle passes will be issued:
            4.6.5.2.3.1. Restricted Passes. Will vary in color. Any vehicle issued this type of
            pass must stay within the confines of Base X at all times, except for real-world
            medical or CCA transport.
            4.6.5.2.3.2. Unrestricted Passes. Will vary in color. The 18 WG/XP is the
            approval authority for these passes. The 18 WG O-6 GOVs and 18 WG/CC have
            blanket authorization. Any vehicle issued this type of pass may only leave Base
            X for OFFICIAL reasons and may not stop at unauthorized locations while
            outside of Base X. Group VCOs will submit a vehicle list to 18 WG/XP which
            reflects the vehicle type, license number, unit, and purpose of the unrestricted
            pass.
30                                               18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012


     4.6.5.2.4. Emergency vehicles (fire, medical, safety, security, barrier maintenance,
     wrecker, mobile maintenance, airfield management, etc.) will have unlimited access
     rights when responding to real-world situations.
     4.6.5.2.5. EEP workers will allow the following vehicles access to Base X and POVs
     will not be allowed on Base X except as noted below:
        4.6.5.2.5.1. Transportation buses ferrying Base X personnel to/from EEPs.
        4.6.5.2.5.2. XP/EET evaluators displaying an XP/EET badge may enter in their
        GOV.
        4.6.5.2.5.3. USMC/353 SOG personnel in uniform and civilian personnel
        working in facilities located in the Play Area who are not participating in the
        exercise may enter in their POV/GOV.
        4.6.5.2.5.4. Vehicles with unrestricted passes or emergency vehicles.
18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                   31


                                           Chapter 5

                               ANALYSIS AND REPORTING

5.1. Exercise Evaluation: Evaluators will document and collect exercise details and
observations immediately from STARTEX to facilitate report writing and classifying
observations (e.g. deficiencies, strengths, etc.). Group representatives are at the core of this
process. They obtain inputs from EET member during the course of the exercise and collectively
determine and classify observations as follows:
   5.1.1. Deficiencies. By definition, a deficiency is normally a Critical, Significant (Major), or
   Minor deficiency. These are usually associated with non-compliance with tech data, OPLAN,
   manuals, timelines, etc., of policy or technical nature. It corresponds to a unit’s inability to
   comply with published guidance.
   5.1.2. Recommended Improvement Areas (RIAs). RIAs are not deficiencies; instead they are
   an identified process, product, or capability which could be improved by a suggested course
   of action. RIAs are included in exercise reports under Areas for Improvement without a
   deficiency number assigned.
   5.1.3. Strengths. Strengths are programs, processes, products, or teams that clearly exceed
   minimum standards or are key to a unit’s success.
   5.1.4. EET Post-Exercise Activities. Following ENDEX, 18 WG/XP will establish a
   meeting place and time for the following:
       5.1.4.1. Initial EET ―Hotwash‖. This meeting will be attended by all functional area
       EET team leads and will normally be scheduled for 2 hours after ENDEX. The purpose
       of this meeting is to facilitate the flow of information between EET members, helping to
       build the ―big picture‖ of what happened and to help identify wing-wide trends. All
       exercise inputs will be due IAW suspense’s established by 18 WG/XP personnel.
       5.1.4.2. Debriefing. A debrief will be scheduled for all IRREs/CEREs/OREs. This
       debrief will give the 18 WG/XP an opportunity to present all inputs to the WG/CC,
       WG/CV, group commanders, participating partner unit commanders, and unit
       commanders with reported discrepancies prior to publishing the report. All Group EET
       leads will attend the debrief.
5.2. Reporting Exercise Deficiencies.
   5.2.1. All wing deficiencies should be reported to 18 WG/XP through the 18 WG/XP
   deficiency database. EET members should gather all facts concerning these deficiencies and
   try to ascertain the root problem. Deficiencies should be submitted by highlighting the root
   cause, with underlying symptoms (observation) listed as sub-bullets. Interaction with other
   EET members is critical in establishing core problems.
   5.2.2. Validation. Validating deficiencies is an important element of the integrity of the
   inspection and should be conducted with affected units as soon as possible. Face-to-face
   validation is preferred, but not required; telephone validations are also authorized. Effective
   validation is accomplished through open and frank discussions between the EET and
   inspected units.
 32                                                      18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012


   5.2.3. If an observation involves a functional area outside that of the evaluator submitting the
   observation, they must discuss it with EET members from that respective area prior to
   submitting to the database.
   5.2.4. Evaluators should validate the deficiency with the supervisor or unit member who can
   fix the problem. Validating is not an acknowledgment of guilt; it is simply verifying that the
   observation identifies a suspected problem area. Evaluators must address the cause of the
   problem. They must confirm the facts and identify references. A review of what is believed
   to be the conditions, impact, and cause should be done with the responsible individual and
   his/her boss. The purpose of the validation process is to identify potential problems before
   writing them in the report.
5.3. Guidance for Writing Observations.
   5.3.1. Commendable. Should be used for recognizing individuals, as well as work centers
   and units, for truly exceptional performance, well above and beyond normal duties.
   Evaluators must remember to include the grade and full name(s) of individual(s) and office
   symbol of work centers or units. All commendable inputs must have sub-bullet statements
   justifying the inputs.
   5.3.2. Strengths. Should be used to document a unit’s strong areas. Strengths should also
   identify areas that were innovative and creative which allow the respective unit to
   accomplish their mission in an easier, more efficient manner. An OPR/OCR is not required.
   5.3.3. Deficiencies. An observation is a deficiency if it involves a failure to comply with
   AFI, failure of a critical process, a major safety violation, a repeat deficiency, or requires
   higher headquarters involvement. Evaluators will cite the governing instruction/regulation
   and provide an OPR. If the 18 WG/CC is designated as the OPR, an OCR is also required.
   5.3.4. Recommended Improvement Area (RIA). A weakness or observation, not serious
   enough to be considered a deficiency, which could be improved with a suggested course of
   action at the unit level.
   5.3.5. Grading Criteria. To standardize the rating system applied to exercises, EET will use
   the same grading criteria as the PACAF/IG. The five-tier rating system in AFI 90-201 will
   be used.
   5.3.6. Group leads assist 18 WG/XP with determining ratings within their assigned area
   based on compliance with published procedures and compliance with safety procedures.
   They will prepare written comments with justification for ratings above and below
   SATISFACTORY. However, EET members should allow the event being evaluated to take
   its natural course and should not interfere as long as valuable training can be safely gained.
5.4. Hot-Wash. At the Wing Commander's discretion, immediately after ENDEX, an exercise
hot wash may be conducted to provide immediate feedback to commanders. The hot wash will
be a broad overview of the exercise scenario, lessons learned, and observations without including
specific deficiencies. If conducted, participants include squadron/group commanders, group
representatives, area chiefs, staff agency chiefs, and key personnel from evaluated areas.
5.5. Validation Process. Group representatives will meet with evaluators and/or exercise
players as soon as practical and discuss observations/deficiencies and validate each accordingly.
18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                              33


   5.5.1. Deficiencies will be validated at ENDEX with individual unit commanders. Units will
   be given an opportunity to clarify/rebut observations and conclusions to avoid
   misunderstandings and improve accuracy.
   5.5.2. Disagreements that cannot be resolved during the validation process will be elevated
   to the Team Chief for further consideration. Note that an area for improvement or
   observation is not final until the report is published.
5.6. Report Writing:
   5.6.1. The Team Chief is the OPR for producing the report NLT 15 days from ENDEX.
   5.6.2. Each Group Representative will input their portion in the provided exercise report
   shell as validated data becomes available, but NLT 72 hours after ENDEX. Each objective
   must be properly evaluated and rated accordingly. During exercises, the Administrative
   Support personnel may assist group representatives with this task.
   5.6.3. The report will provide specific reporting and closure instructions. The Team Chief
   and respective group representatives will track deficiencies until closure and maintain a
   record of all exercise reports and replies.

                                            Chapter 6

                                         OPERATIONS

6.1. Purpose. This chapter outlines how the 18th Operations Group exercises its war-fighting
capabilities. It is written in general terms so as to apply to a variety of potential taskings. This
information is intended to provide guidelines only and is not regulatory in nature.
6.2. General CONOPS. This section contains information applicable to all 18 OG units during
LOREs/ORIs.
   6.2.1. Combat Plans Cell. The CPC works directly for the wing weapons officer. The
   18 WG Weapons Officer, or designated representative, will coordinate with HHQ (White
   Cell/EET) on all flying-related matters. In addition, the CPC breaks out the ATO and
   produces the flying schedule, monitors WRM inventory, mission plans, coordinates with
   outside units, and briefs aircrew on mission specifics. CPC will attend and brief details at the
   command staff meetings as required.
       6.2.1.1. The CPC will download the daily ATO via secure means (SIPRNet, secure fax).
       6.2.1.2. The CPC will build the flying schedule (shell) based on the ATO and distribute
       the schedule via secure means: TASAMS (primary), SIPRNet, secure fax, hand carry,
       etc. Individual-tasked flying squadrons (and/or OSS tanker scheduling) will build flying
       schedules based on the ATO and input into TASAMS in the event of CPC loss.
       6.2.1.3. The CPC will build a GAT flow and ensure a copy is sent to all relevant
       agencies. Individual tasked flying squadrons (and/or OSS tanker scheduling), MOC, and
       Shogun Control will fill the TASAMS shell with additional scheduling information as
       required.
       6.2.1.4. If unable to receive/send the schedule via secure means, it is the individual unit’s
       responsibility to coordinate alternate means of transmitting the relevant information.
   6.2.2. Command and Control of Aircraft Assets.
       6.2.2.1. TASAMS will be used as the primary flight following system during the
       execution phase. All units’ players should provide timely input of relevant data into
       TASAMs to aide C2. The SOF is responsible for inputting takeoff and land times. Base
       operations will input takeoff and land times when the SOF is not on duty or SOF
       workload does not allow input of the times (i.e., event time plus five minutes).
       6.2.2.2. Shogun Control.
           6.2.2.2.1. Manning. Shogun Control will be manned during flight operations by a
           minimum of one fighter pilot and either an AWACS crew member or tanker crew
           member.
           6.2.2.2.2. Responsibilities. Shogun Control is the liaison between White Cell, the
           command staff, and flight operations. It will operate on a UHF frequency listed in the
           18 WG Exercise In-flight Guide and on SATCOM frequencies as coordinated.
           Secure communication is required and should be provided by the 18th
           Communications Squadron. Shogun Control will perform the following tasks:
18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                               35


            6.2.2.2.2.1. Provide mission execution and fleet status reports for the command
            staff.
            6.2.2.2.2.2. Direct Alert Scrambles.          Shogun Control will receive the
            alert/scramble order from White Force and pass to the appropriate flying
            operations center, Ramp Rat, and directly to the aircrew/aircraft (if able) to
            expedite the order. After aircraft check-in, Shogun Control will pass further
            scramble instructions directly to the aircraft. If unable to meet a tasking, Shogun
            Control will notify the 18 OG/CC (and White Force as directed by the OG)..
            6.2.2.2.2.3. Work with each flying operations center and MOC to determine asset
            status and availability.
            6.2.2.2.2.4. Supervise execution of the daily ATO. Shogun Control will conduct
            flight-following by tracking takeoffs, landings, diverts, and overdue aircraft.
            6.2.2.2.2.5. In the event any MDS operations center is damaged or destroyed,
            Shogun Control will act as their communications liaison until they can re-
            establish operations at their alternate facility.
         6.2.2.2.3. Location. Shogun Control will operate out of the ICC. Requirements for
         the facility include a UHF secure-comm capable radio, SATCOM capability,
         SIPR/NIPRNet computer, and STE phone. Shogun Control POC will pre-position all
         checklists and materials necessary to accomplish Shogun Control’s duties in both
         primary and alternate facilities.
  6.2.3. Flying Unit Ops Desks. Flying operations sections are tasked to execute the daily
  flying schedule. The MDS specific ops desk serves as a single POC for all MDS-specific
  flying and maintenance-related issues. All MDS ops desks will be manned as necessary to
  accomplish mission related to include, but not limited to:
     6.2.3.1. Scheduling aircraft and aircrew while managing crew rest/recalls
     6.2.3.2. Providing updated names and tail numbers to Shogun Control
     6.2.3.3. Managing the flight line through the Ramp Rat/Standby Duty Officer (SDO)
     6.2.3.4. Coordinating with the CPC on future ATO taskings
     6.2.3.5. Providing CPC augmentation as required
     6.2.3.6. Coordinating flight line transportation as required
  6.2.4. CSAR. White Force provides CSAR tasking to Shogun Control by simulating the
  Joint Search and Rescue Center (JSRC). Shogun Control will contact the local rescue ops
  desk via STE, VOSIP secure chat, or over a pre-briefed frequency for airborne SAR aircraft.
  6.2.5. SOF. The 18 WG SOF will be performed by a SOF qualified F-15 pilot.
     6.2.5.1. The 909 ARS and 961 AACS Operations Supervisors and Standby Duty Officers
     (SDO) will function as an 18 WG/SOF for their respective aircraft operations.
     6.2.5.2. The SOF should remain vigilant of base conditions and ensure the current threat,
     Alarm, and MOPP conditions are posted on ATIS.
  6.2.6. Weather.

   Intelligence Network (CIN) that includes the Combat Intelligence Center, the ICC
   Intelligence representative, the intelligence cells in flying squadrons, and all other
   intelligence elements in the Wing. The CIN integrates intelligence into the command and
   control, mission planning, air operations, and base defense/force protection of the Wing. The
   SIO also serves as the co-chair of the Threat Working Group.
   6.2.8. Aircrew Flight Equipment. The 18 OSS AFE personnel attached to flying units will
   maintain aircrew life support equipment and weapons. When directed by the command staff
   and in coordination with the EOC/CBRN, AFE personnel will establish aircrew chemical
   defense operations utilizing OSS assets.
   6.2.9. SERE instructors will evaluate aircrews in the field during SAREXs. Cooperation
   between White Force/EET, Intel, and Rescue EET will ensure all aspects of a SAREX are
   properly coordinated and evaluated. All 18 WG mission-ready aircrews are eligible for
   short-notice SAREX tasking.
   6.2.10. Deploying Units. Certain OG units will deploy under both FTB and Base X
   scenarios. They include elements of the 18 AES, 31 RQS, and 33 RQS. The 909 ARS and
   961 AACS may deploy in either scenario.
      6.2.10.1. Tasking for deploying elements of the above units in a FTB scenario will be
      provided by White Cell, simulating each unit’s actual command chain during the
      employment phase. The 18 WG will continue to provide C2 decisions regarding
      FPCON, GDP, MOPP levels, alarm conditions, INFOCON, etc., for deployed units.
      Each unit will react to given attack/MOPP conditions for their location as depicted on the
      Kadena Air Base chem zone map. Each UCC will report to the Kadena EOC. The 18
      WG Command Staff attendance by both the home and simulated deployed locations
      leadership will be on an as-capable basis.
6.3. Unit-Specific CONOPS.
   6.3.1. 18 AES CONOPS.
      6.3.1.1. The 18 AES real-world alert crews will not participate and are exempt from
      exercise play. The scheduler on-call, SDO, line driver(s) and all other personnel involved
      in real-world mission execution are exempt from exercise play while performing real-
      world duties.
      6.3.1.2. Initial Response (Phase I). During Phase I, the 18 AES UCC will operate from
      its garrison location on a schedule directed by EOC/CSD.

     provide/demonstrate one or a combination of the following capabilities during Phase II:
        6.3.1.4.1. Mobile Aeromedical Staging Facility (MASF). Regardless of its physical
        location, the MASF may be considered deployed. Base support services will be
        responsible for all facilities, equipment and services to the MASF when located at in
        the 18 AES garrison facility IAW the unit’s DOC statement and applicable OPLAN.
        6.3.1.4.2. Aeromedical Evacuation Liaison Team (AELT). If exercised, the AELT
        will verify and coordinate physiology of flight issues and patient flight movement
        requirements. The AELT will locate itself with the primary medical provider of Base
        X and align itself to their contingency plans.
        6.3.1.4.3. Aeromedical Evacuation Operations Team (AEOT). The AEOT will
        demonstrate its ability to successfully manage AE crews and launch/recover missions.
        The AEOT will conduct operations from the 18 AES garrison facility.
        6.3.1.4.4. Aeromedical Evacuation Crew. The AECS will provide command of
        assigned AE forces, including ADCON and OPCON of the AELT, AEOT, UCC,
        MASF and exercise AE crews. It will also advise the 18 WG/CC, OG/CC, MDG/CC,
        as well as other agencies on AE capabilities and requirements. The AECS will be co-
        located with the UCC. Communication to and from the AECS, 18 WG/EOC, and
        White Force will be through the UCC.
        6.3.1.4.5. Aeromedical Evacuation Command Squadron. The 18 AES exercise
        AECs are under the direction of the AECS/AEOT, managed by the scheduler on-call
        and EET. Once crews are alerted for exercise missions, all AE crew members will
        attend an intel briefing prior to completing mission preparation. Upon completion of
        an intel briefing, all AE crew members will continue with the mission preparation
        based upon geographical orientation and availability of aircraft. The 18 AES Current
        Operations will alert the medical crew director and coordinate with the SQ tasked to
        provide airlift. The medical crew director will alert the rest of the AE crew members.

        Installation Deployment Readiness Cell (IDRC), 31 RQS FTB personnel will transfer
        all FTB operations to designated play areas. The 31 RQS FTB UCC will maintain
        24/7 operations until all UCC duties have been transferred to the deployed location.
        At this point, the garrison facility will be off limits to 31 RQS FTB personnel. Any
        31 RQS personnel not deploying will be absorbed into the 18 OSS to FTB and/or
        perform 31 RQS URM duties.
        6.3.2.2.2. 33 RQS/33 AMU. The 33 RQS and AMU personnel will report to Base X
        at the beginning of their next shift following processing through the IDRC. The
        33 RQS and AMU personnel not deploying to Base X will be absorbed into the
        OG/MXG’s personnel augmentation pool.
     6.3.2.3. Employment (Phase II) FTB.
        6.3.2.3.1. Chain of Command. The 31 RQS’s FTB personnel will operate under the
        command and control of the 31 RQS.
        6.3.2.3.2. UCC. The 31 RQS and 33 RQS FTB UCC will operate as a single entity.
        6.3.2.3.3. FTB Play Areas/ No-Play Areas will be designated prior to STARTEX.
     6.3.2.4. Employment (Phase II) Base X.
        6.3.2.4.1. Deployed Chain of Command. Base X personnel will operate under the C2
        of the 18 ERQS. All ERQS personnel deployed to Base X will stage and operate out
        of a Base X Play Area.
        6.3.2.4.2. The STE phone and TBMCS computer located in the UCC area are
        considered base support equipment and their use is limited to the Base X UCC.
        6.3.2.4.3. Perimeter Sweep team duties will be accomplished by whatever unit is
        occupying a given facility. Base X personnel are not responsible for manning a base
        security perimeter.
        6.3.2.4.4. A minimum of one Airman with an LMR is required at any ECP.
        6.3.2.4.5. Where available, all Base X personnel will use pre-existing secure/non-
        secure communications infrastructure.
        6.3.2.4.6. Additional planning time considerations will be factored into mission
        planning to facilitate movement of pararescue personnel between Play Areas during
        base alarm conditions.
  6.3.3. 44/67 FS CONOPS.
     6.3.3.1. Definitions.
        6.3.3.1.1. Operations Supervisor. The ops sup is the primary POC for fighter
        scheduling, and works with the duty scheduler if one is present. When accomplishing
18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                39


        the ATO, the ops sup and Ramp Rat will work in conjunction with maintenance and
        Shogun Control to prioritize and execute missions as required due to fallout, ATO
        changes, or HHQ taskings. The ops sup tasks pilots while they are inside the fighter
        ops building and while in transit to and from aircraft. Once pilots have started
        engines, their command authority becomes Shogun Control. Pilots who have started
        engines will continue to work maintenance issues through the ops sup and Ramp Rat.
        6.3.3.1.2. Ramp Rat. The Ramp Rat works for fighter ops and will be manned with
        an F-15 qualified pilot and a maintenance production superintendent. The Ramp Rat
        is the ops sup’s representative on the flight line. Ramp Rat passes information to
        pilots as required (including alert scramble notifications), manages the availability of
        FMC aircraft, and ensures expenditures are passed to flight line maintenance to
        expedite re-supply/loading of missiles.
        6.3.3.1.3. Gopher. The Gopher works for fighter ops, primarily to transport pilots to
        and from the Upper Fighter Ramp. Additional duties are as required by the ops sup.
        Gopher may be manned with any person assigned to the 44 FS, 67 FS, or respective
        AMU. The Gopher will possess a flight line driver’s license for Kadena AB.
     6.3.3.2. Initial Response (Phase I) FTB.
        6.3.3.2.1. Operating Location. Both fighter squadrons will utilize a single operating
        facility for all fighter ops in a FTB scenario.
        6.3.3.2.2. Recall Procedures. The ops sup on duty is primarily responsible for
        initiating a recall to fighter personnel when informed to do so. Recall procedures will
        be IAW 18 WG guidelines. Normally the ops sup will initiate a complete recall upon
        receipt of a DEPORD, to bring personnel to fighter ops for a situation brief by unit
        Intel and SQ/CCs. Variations may apply, based on taskings, pilot rest requirements,
        and other considerations.
        6.3.3.2.3. Facility Hardening Plan. Both fighter squadron facilities will be hardened
        IAW the Kadena CE Hardening Plan. The unit will supplement the plan with
        additional hardening measures to protect mission-essential vehicles and protect key
        parts of the building. The hardening plan will be documented and applicable supplies
        will be maintained in the facility.
     6.3.3.3. Employment (Phase II) FTB.
        6.3.3.3.1. Sweep procedures. UCC will accomplish building sweeps. If short-
        manned and with DO or CC approval, augment sweep teams with duty scheduler. In
        all cases, minimize unnecessary risk to mission-ready pilots.
        6.3.3.3.2. Bugout Procedures. Upon arrival at the new location, UCC will set up
        door checks to maintain personnel accountability, and ensure appropriate ATSO
        posture.
        6.3.3.3.2.1. During a bugout of fighter ops, the ops sup will hold responsibility for
        bringing necessary materials to continue his/her job on the move and at the new
        location. Classified material will be locked up before leaving. COMSEC, KY-58
        crypto, and classified hard drives will be secured in a safe. The alternate fighter ops
40                                                     18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012


        location will be equipped with identical classified material to preclude having to
        transport it. WDO is responsible for securing vault safes and doors.
        6.3.3.3.3. Aircraft Acceptance, Alert Status, and Crew Ready Procedures. Fighter
        ops-MX LOAs establish the following standards. For this document, the abbreviation
        ―MX‖ refers to the combined 67/44 AMUs.
            6.3.3.3.3.1. Definitions.  For definitions of generation and acceptance
            terminology (e.g., Hot-Cocked, On-Status, Cold Acceptance, etc.) reference the
            F-15 Exercise IFG.
            6.3.3.3.3.2. Aircraft Generation. When MX begins generating aircraft IAW a
            DEPORD, fighter ops will begin scheduling ops sups and pilots for the purpose of
            accepting generated aircraft. All pilot acceptances will be via cold acceptance.
            Reference the F-15 Exercise IFG for the Cold Acceptance Checklist.
            6.3.3.3.3.3. Hot pre-flights and hot acceptances will be by exception only, as
            requested by MX or 18 WG/XP. As the generation approaches completion, the
            ops sup will seek to begin hot-cocking already accepted aircraft based on known
            or anticipated alert commitments.
                6.3.3.3.3.3.1. Acceptance/Hot-Cock Timeline. To the max extent possible,
                MX and the ops sup will strive to step alert pilots to jets that have already
                been hot-cocked. These pilots will step NLT 30 minutes prior to their fragged
                on-status time. If stepping an alert pilot to a jet that has not been hot-cocked,
                pilots should be given a minimum of 60 minutes to run the aircraft, hot-cock
                it, and call ―On Status‖ by the required time.
                6.3.3.3.3.3.2. Alert Scramble. Shogun Control is the conduit through which
                alert posture changes or alert scramble orders will be issued. See F-15C Alert
                Standards for more details on alert status and scramble starts.
     6.3.3.4. Initial Response (Phase I) Base X.
        6.3.3.4.1. Operating Location. During a Base X scenario, Base X fighter operations
        will use the 44th FS building and in-garrison fighter operations will use 67 FS
        building.
        6.3.3.4.2. Recall Procedures are the same as a FTB scenario.
        6.3.3.4.3. Facility Preparation is the same as a FTB scenario.
        6.3.3.4.4. Aircraft deployment to Base X. Fighters at Base X are identified by a gap
        in parking spots between newly arrived Base X jets and those still at Kadena. All jets
        start in the flow-throughs on the upper fighter ramp at Kadena. The first 12 jets that
        deploy to Base X will usually launch from Flows 1-12 and recover in the protective
        aircraft shelters (PAS)/hard stands away from the upper fighter ramp when they
        chock-in at Base X. As more jets launch from Kadena flows 13-50, recovery will
        begin at Flow 1. Jets that do not make the launch because of maintenance problems
        are towed to the high-numbered flows to free up parking spots for Base X to expand.
     6.3.3.5. Employment (Phase II) Base X. Base X employment will be the same as a FTB
     scenario.

        6.3.4.3.1. The 623 ACF will operate from JASDF, Southwestern Direction Center
        facility at Naha AB during all portions of Phase II. From this location 623d Theater
        Control Operations Teams (TCOTs) will provide maximum vulnerability period
        coverage in support of ATO tasking. Crews will transit between Kadena AB and
        Naha AB daily in assigned GOVs.
        6.3.4.3.2. Due to local political sensitivities, the 623 ACF will not wear IPE/CWDE
        outside Kadena AB or while working inside Naha Air Base. The 623d TCOTs will
        be considered non-players and will not respond to alarm conditions beginning when
        within 10 feet of the GOV they are using to transit to Naha and they are in the process
        of removing their IPE in preparation for departing for Naha. They will be full players
        at all other times they are on Kadena IAW para 1.12. Crews will utilize the 18 OSS
        or other designated location to receive the Combat Plans brief. Once the briefing is
        received, the parking lot of the designated location will serve as the transition point
        for doffing IPE gear in preparation for transit. Upon completion of their mission
        tasking and reentering the play area, 623 ACF personnel will assume the proper
        MOPP level for their work area and proceed with the debrief.
        6.3.4.3.3. To facilitate mission planning, two 623d personnel will be assigned to the
        18 OSS CPC to deliver and produce required mission planning products and briefings
        to 623d TCOTs. TCOTs will utilize Bldg. 728, Bldg. 3384, or other designated
        location to receive the Combat Plans brief. Post mission briefing, the parking lot of
        the designated location will serve as the transition point for doffing IPE gear in
        preparation for transit. Upon completion of their mission tasking and reentering the
        play area, 623 ACF personnel will assume the appropriate MOPP level and resume
        full player status.

        processing of aircrews once a WARNORD has dropped. Organic and ROTE chalks
        will be generated, equipment palletized and processed by the IDRC for deployment.
        Sorties simulating deployment aircraft departures may be flown. The scenario may
        require the KC-135 to depart home station and employ en route to Base X. Once the
        deployment process has successfully been demonstrated, the 909 ARS will transition
        to a FTB scenario. Upon transition to FTB, all the personnel and equipment that were
        simulated to be deployed will return to the squadron and be available to support the
        FTB scenario. For training purposes and to simulate reach-back capability, those
        personnel not deployed on the UTC will also return to the squadron to be available
        for the FTB scenario.
     6.3.5.2. Employment.

      7.1.3.4. Monitor the ATO for impact on maintenance operations.
      7.1.3.5. Ensure coordination of maintenance support.
   7.1.4. The 18 AMXS Generation Super will coordinate pre-generation line-up on the AF
   Form 2409 with the MOC at PTDO. The generation line-up will finalize and provide to the
   MOC and Ammo Control (via Weapons Super) as soon as possible after EXORD.
   7.1.5. Aircraft Parking Plan.
      7.1.5.1. During generation, F-15s will utilize the flow-throughs and PASs as required.
      7.1.5.2. KC-135 and E-3 aircraft will generate in their normal parking areas on the north
      side (Nancy/Lima/Mike Rows).
      7.1.5.3. HH-60s will generate in front of Hangar 3534, 33 RQS/AMU (Helo 1-3 and
      Papa Row). The 33 RQS will demonstrate deployment by recovering on CME ramp next
      to Hangar 3490 and will operate from this location for the duration of the exercise.
   7.1.6. Pilot and EET aircraft acceptance procedures.
      7.1.6.1. Aircraft will be considered generated/regenerated IAW the PACAF supplement
      to AFI 90-201.
      7.1.6.2. Units must advise the MOC when an aircraft is ready for EET acceptance. The
      MOC timekeeper will record the time and notify EET of aircraft line number and time of
      request. IAW the PACAF supplement to AFI 90-201, the time EET is notified the
      aircraft is ready for acceptance will be the official time for the generation. EET will
      immediately advise MOC of their ETA to the aircraft, record the time of request, and
      dispatch EET evaluators to accomplish the acceptance inspection. NOTE: Exceptional
      release and aircrew acceptance must be annotated prior to EET beginning
      generation/regeneration acceptance inspection on all MDS.
      7.1.6.3. Maintenance EET and weapons EET will inspect all aircraft with a single
      aircraft acceptance inspection. When the number of days allotted for the exercise does
      not facilitate a Pause Ex, these inspections may be performed separately. If performed
18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                45


     separately, once the aircraft is accepted by Weapons EET and all proper documentation
     has been entered in the aircraft forms (per para 3.3.3.1), the owning AMU/SQ can
     reconfigure/download the aircraft for employment. If either weapons or maintenance
     EET acceptance inspections identify a safety of flight or system reliability discrepancy,
     the aircraft will be rejected. For an aircraft to meet acceptance requirements, both
     Maintenance and Weapons EET acceptance inspections must be completed within the
     allotted time. Rejected aircraft will graded IAW the PACAF supplement to AFI 90-201.
     7.1.6.4. Maintenance EET and weapons EET will annotate an INFO NOTE in the
     applicable AFTO Forms 781A stating: aircraft accepted by Maintenance/Weapons EET,
     date, time, applicable findings and collect data for tracking purposes. EET members will
     enter all discrepancies noted during the inspection in AFTO Form 781A. Maintenance
     and weapons EET will brief the respective Production Superintendent on any
     discrepancies found on aircraft regardless of whether the aircraft was accepted or
     rejected.
     7.1.6.5. EET will log discrepancies identified during inspections and provide collected
     information as an integral part of the LORE inspection report.
     7.1.6.6. F-15 MX will affix an AF Form 2409, Generation Sequence Action Schedule, to
     the outboard surface of the left vari-ramp. A cone will be placed in front of all generated
     F-15s when it is pilot accepted and ready for EET. No further maintenance is allowed on
     the aircraft without coordination of the cell boss or Production Superintendent. If
     maintenance is performed, the aircraft must have its exceptional release re-accomplished
     and a pilot must re-accept the aircraft.
     7.1.6.7. The DCC or ADCC, if possible, will provide aircraft’s AFTO Form 781 binder
     to the EET evaluator upon arrival. The DCC, ADCC or Cell Boss should accompany
     EET during aircraft acceptance inspection.
     7.1.6.8. The 33 RQS will provide a flight engineer to observe the EET evaluator
     inspection. A flight engineer will be present during all alert aircraft inspections. The
     DCC will provide an AF Form 2408, Generation Maintenance Plan, AF Form 2409,
     Generation Sequence Action Schedule, and aircraft’s AFTO Form 781 binder to the EET
     evaluator upon arrival.
     7.1.6.9. The 909 ARS will provide an aircrew member to observe the EET evaluator
     inspection actions to maintain integrity of the aircraft. The DCC will provide the
     aircraft’s AFTO Form 781 binder, AF Form 2408, and AF Form 2409 to the EET
     evaluator upon arrival.
  7.1.7. The 909 AMU KC-135R/961 AMU E-3 Real-World HHQ Missions or Alert Missions
  CONOPS. Reference the 18 WG simulations for real-world mission ROE.
  7.1.8. Munitions Operations During Aircraft Generation.
     7.1.8.1. All appropriate fire symbol placards will be placed on the front of the PAS (if
     used) as soon as munitions are delivered to that location.
     7.1.8.2. All munitions deliveries will be coordinated to ensure appropriate agencies are
     notified. The 18 MUNS will notify the MOC prior to leaving the munitions area. MOC
     will notify the fire department of pending munitions delivery and coordinate evacuation
46                                                     18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012


     of non-related personnel IAW AFMAN 91-201, 18 WG Sup 1, Explosives Safety
     Standards. The F-15 weapons superintendent will notify MOC of the location of
     munitions trailers by spot number upon acceptance of delivery and will coordinate all
     munitions movements between aircraft with Munitions Control. The HH-60 weapons
     expeditor will coordinate with Munitions Control at home station. Deployed weapons
     expediter will coordinate with deployed munitions personnel for re-supply.
     7.1.8.3. Unless specifically authorized by the weapons load crew chief, no concurrent
     maintenance actions will be conducted during weapons loading. The weapons load crew
     chief will direct nonessential personnel out of the weapons loading area and provide a
     safety briefing to all members required to remain in the area.
     7.1.8.4. Gun systems will be configured cold (Pins/Holdback tools installed/Rounds
     limiter to limit/990) until immediately prior to weapons supervisor post load inspection.
     At that time, missiles will be connected and gun will be configured hot (Pins
     reversed/Holdback tools removed/Rounds limiter to ―no-limit‖ and rounds counter set
     IAW 1F-15-33-1-2, Non-nuclear Munitions Loading Procedures).
     7.1.8.5. Following Weapons EET acceptance, crews will download all live tactical
     missiles and reconfigure aircraft with training missiles. This may occur prior to pilot and
     EET acceptance. Guns will be returned to cold status and aircraft reconfigured to meet
     Phase II configuration requirements after aircraft and weapons EET acceptance
     inspections are completed. AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures, contains
     tactical missile flight restrictions.
     7.1.8.6. To the maximum extent possible, 18 MUNS will ensure fully loaded UALs/
     LALS, and empty UALS/LALS are positioned in each loading area (44th/67th) to
     support loading/downloading operations. No more than two belts will be downloaded
     into each UALS/LALS.
     7.1.8.7. The 18 MUNS will ensure the mobile TMJ-72, Argon Bottle Charger, is
     positioned on the flight line and available when needed. NOTE: Using CATM argon
     bottles in live missiles is prohibited.
  7.1.9. Aircraft Regeneration (Phase II) and Munitions Re-supply Procedures.
     7.1.9.1. Reloading will be accomplished for pilot reported expenditures and any EET
     injects. Pilots will squawk simulated expenditures to expedite re-supply and document
     simulated expenditures in the aircraft AFTO Form 781A.
     7.1.9.2. All weapons BPO inspections, actual or simulated, will be accomplished by the
     applicable AMU or Armament Flight Rapid Response Team and documented in the
     aircraft forms. Tools/equipment needed to complete the task will be available on the spot
     for both simulated and actual inspections.
     7.1.9.3. F-15 weapons load crews will conduct reloading operations using half-up/half-
     down procedures as follows: All half-up/-down procedures will be completed from
     aircraft preparation through simulated cartridge installation and post-load. Each missile
     must be returned to the trailer before being uploaded on another station. Once all
     required munitions are loaded, perform a weapons post-load, and then download
     munitions (crew members may prepare missiles for download as soon as load crew chief
18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                 47


     performs a post load on that station). Document reloads in the aircraft AFTO Form
     781A.
     7.1.9.4. F-15 aircraft gun procedures. Reload when the system falls below 50 percent
     capacity based on pilot-reported expenditures (simulated or actual). Gun load simulation
     includes connecting the loading system, pneumatic gun and flex drive to the aircraft and
     waiting 5 minutes before disconnecting. Document the aircraft AFTO Form 781A and
     the UALS/LALS upload/download forms when complete.
     7.1.9.5. F-15 chaff/flare procedures. Reload will be accomplished when the system falls
     below 50 percent capacity based on pilot reported expenditures (simulated or actual). All
     aircraft will be fully replenished with chaff/flare prior to the first sortie of each flying
     day.
     7.1.9.6. HH-60 chaff/flare procedures. Reload will be accomplished when system falls
     below 50 percent capacity based on pilot reported expenditures (simulated or actual).
     7.1.9.7. Reconciliation will be accomplished with line delivery not later than 2 hours
     after the last aircraft downtime (unless impeded by Alarm Black/MOPP 4 at which time
     reconciliation will be accomplished as soon as possible when cleared to continue
     working). If the flying day exceeds 2400 hours, reconciliation will be accomplished not
     later than 0200, with expenditures for that day ending at 2400 hours.
     7.1.9.8. Weapons expediters will track simulated and actual expenditures on separate 18
     WG Forms 62, Munitions Configuration and Expenditure Document, and will provide
     copies to 18 MUNS for expenditure tracking, Armament Flight for rounds fired, and the
     MRC to meet XP deliverable requirements.
  7.1.10. Maintenance Communications. The MOC possess overall responsibility to assign
  and change LMR frequencies during FTB exercises. Table 3.1 contains assignments for
  maintenance radio nets during exercise operations.
     7.1.10.1. If frequency jamming occurs, MOC will notify the 18th Communications
     Squadron of the date, time, and net on which the jamming occurred. MOC should direct
     affected units to alternate nets. Backup communication devices will be telephone or
     runner.
     7.1.10.2. MOPP 4 Communications. Maintenance personnel should make use of air
     horns, voice emitters, etc., to ensure effective communication is maintained during
     MOPP 4 conditions. Vehicles equipped with flags will ensure the correct alarm condition
     flag is displayed at all times and will blow their vehicle horns at alarm condition changes
     to alert personnel. Maintenance aircraft tow teams must use air horns instead of whistles
     during MOPP 4 towing operations.

7.2. Base X.
   7.2.1. The deployed MXG/CC will have control of the entire deployed maintenance
   operation.
   7.2.2. When the 18 WG deploys an Alpha and/or Bravo AMU F-15 maintenance team, the
   Alpha AMU OIC is responsible for ensuring the deployed 18 WG F-15 mission is fully
   supported by all deployed maintenance personnel.
   7.2.3. The duties of the Alpha AMU OIC will include:
      7.2.3.1. Monitor status of aircraft and brief status at all Command Staff meetings.
      7.2.3.2. Coordinate the repair of aircraft that have diverted to other airfields.
      7.2.3.3. Designate/monitor CANN aircraft to eliminate duplication of effort.

      7.2.3.6. Ensure coordination of maintenance support.
      7.2.3.7. Coordinate any requests to home station for maintenance support.
   7.2.4. Aircraft Parking Plan.
      7.2.4.1. Fighters will utilize the flow throughs and PASs as required. Fighters will
      simulate parking at Base X. For flow thrus requiring simulated walls, use rope between
      the spots. On the back side of the flow thru, use cones to simulate the wall. Put the
      cones aside during launch operations and after launch, return the cones to simulate the
      back wall. A minimum of three cones per spot will be used to simulate the back wall.
      7.2.4.2. KC-135 and E-3 aircraft will park in their normal parking areas on the north side
      of the runway.
   7.2.4.3. Deployed HH-60s will park on the CME ramp next to Bldg. 3490 on the south side
   of the runway.
   7.2.5. Munitions operations during aircraft generation. Weapons 2W1/2W0 cadre personnel
   will initiate paperwork to establish a munitions account at Base X.
   7.2.6. Aircraft Regeneration (Phase II) and Munitions Resupply Procedures.
      7.2.6.1. F-15 aircraft landing at Base X are simulated loaded live with a full combat SCL
      provided aircraft was generated at point of origin. Aircraft will be serviced, inspected,
      and loaded/reloaded (as applicable) for ATO tasking or "Alert" status as directed.
      7.2.6.2. For regeneration of Base X sorties prior to transition day, the 44/67 AMUs will
      only be required to refuel the number of aircraft needed for the post-regeneration sorties.
      For example, if only eight sorties are to be launched after the regeneration, then only 10
      aircraft (eight primaries and two spares) need to be refueled at Base X. This will reduce
      the number of de-fuels required at the beginning of transition day or ENDEX.
      7.2.6.3. Deployed personnel will use only the equipment/tools that were deployed, or are
      already in-place at Base X. Any shortfalls will be procured using the proper
      support/supply channels.

   7.2.7. Maintenance Communications. The MOC possess overall responsibility to assign and
   change radio frequencies during Base X operations. The following are assignments for
   maintenance radio nets during exercise operation.
      7.2.7.1. Deployed radios. SQs will deploy with their own radios to augment the MOC’s
      radios. MOC will coordinate with squadrons and develop a plan to process these radios
      through MOC-LMR or Base LMR for simulated rechanneling. This rechanneling will
      take place prior to departure for Base X. Radios can either be hand carried or processed
      as part of each SQ’s mobility package. Each SQ will provide MOC with a list of radio
      serial numbers prior to STARTEX. The MOC will use this list to verify serial numbers
      prior to rekeying any radio.
      7.2.7.2. Deployed cellular phones. Personnel may deploy with government issued
      cellular phones. Upon arrival at Base X these cell phones will be considered simulated
      issued by 18th Contracting Squadron.

                                MEDICAL AND CHAPLAIN

8.1. Responsibilities.
   8.1.1. The 18 MDG working with SQ Medical Elements (SMEs) will:
       8.1.1.1. Comply with Kadena’s Installation Deployment Plan (IDP), Fight the Base
       Concept of Operations (CONOPS), and other applicable local directives in order to
       provide the required base medical support for Kadena AB personnel.
       8.1.1.2. Support a primary and if necessary an alternate medical facility. To adequately
       support the alternate medical facility, the 18 MDG may simulate a pre-positioned Air
       Transportable Clinic and a Patient Decon Tent near the alternate facility.
       8.1.1.3. Ensure any medical vehicle requirements are supported using resources assigned
       to the 18 MDG.
       8.1.1.4. Expand medical operations when needed and as directed by the 18 MDG/CC to
       provide medical personnel in sufficient quantity.
   8.1.2. The Military Treatment Facility (MTF) Commander will:
       8.1.2.1. Provide two (2) hand-held radios, as required by the SME.
       8.1.2.2. Ensure all exercise participants are familiar with real-world medical care
       procedures as outlined in below.
8.2. Real-world Patient Care.
   8.2.1. Real-world Patient Care. Direction for exercise participants needing real-world
   medical care will be published in a Command Staff Directive. In the event of a real-world
   emergency, the first person on-scene should contact 911 immediately. Ambulance services
   will coordinate the necessary care through normal channels and follow directed procedures to
   either transport the patient to the US Naval Hospital Okinawa Emergency Department or to
   the Kadena AB Clinic.
   8.2.2. The entire east side of the Medical Facility is used for real world; inside for patient
   care by providers, and outside for patient parking. The east side of the building covers from
   the front entrance around the east of the building to the covered parking area.
8.3. 18 MDG CONOPS.
   8.3.1. FTB.
       8.3.1.1. The Medical Security Team will be required to conduct external sweeps for the
       entire MDG perimeter. A portion of the third floor of the MDG is a no-play area due to
       infection control issues with Area Dental Laboratory. Signage will be used to mark both
       play and no-play areas on each floor. Inside the facility, the Security Team will sweep
       the occupied basement area. Security will also sweep all play areas on the second and
       third floor.
18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                               53


     8.3.1.2. The Aeromedical Staging Facility may demonstrate the ability to prepare for
     incoming forces by assembling a minimum of 20 percent of the Contingency
     Aeromedical Staging Facility.
     8.3.1.3. The MDG is a Casualty Collection Point and will ensure medical personnel are
     available to receive casualties on a 24-hour basis.
     8.3.1.4. The following capabilities will have 24-hour in-house coverage: NEO, OAEEP,
     Medical Control Center, Security, Public Health (during initial Mobilization phases)
     Patient Care, Patient Administration, Manpower, Transportation, real-world flight line
     and emergency response capability, Sick Call/Acute Care Clinic, and EOC support.
     8.3.1.5. To facilitate a common use of MDG terms, the following definitions should be
     used:
        8.3.1.5.1. Casualty is defined as: A living individual that has been wounded and
        requires medical attention immediately.
        8.3.1.5.2. Deceased is defined as: An individual that has been declared dead by
        competent medical authority. A physician can declare an individual deceased on
        scene or in the morgue.
     8.3.1.6. Casualty care will be provided at the Kadena Clinic.
     8.3.1.7. Casualty Processing. All casualties will be transported to the CCP using
     vehicles of opportunity. Units will notify their MCC when transporting their simulated
     casualties. Initially, casualties will be brought to the CCP and will be triaged. The
     Manpower team will support the arrival of casualties if directed to respond by the MCC.
     If there is a possible presence of contamination, the casualty will be triaged as
     contaminated versus uncontaminated. After appropriate decontamination, simulated
     casualties will be brought into the building for treatment. Simulated patients then enter
     the building for simulated care and then are discharged with the desired exercise input of
     return to duty, deceased, requiring aeromedical evacuation, or transport to USNHO. The
     CCP will have administrative personnel perform the appropriate patient administration
     functions to medically process and properly record disposition of the patient. The
     administrative paperwork collected by the Patient Administration Team will be used to
     report personnel status to PERSCO. After the established holding period, disposition will
     occur as defined.
     8.3.1.8. Squadron Medical Elements using an Air Transportable Clinic, or other
     facilities, can also support flight line operations. The SME level of involvement in
     support of 18 MDG operations will vary based on exercise and real-world mission
     requirements. SMEs, as per standard CONOPS, become assets of the MTF.
     8.3.1.9. The SME teams will provide patient care to the maximum extent possible;
     however, care may be extremely limited without the main clinic. Emphasis will be
     placed on protecting patients and staff from potential contaminants and to transporting
     casualties to USNHO for inpatient care.
     8.3.1.10. Unit personnel will perform SABC prior to transporting casualties via vehicles
     of opportunity to the appropriate CCP for triage. All available, uncommitted vehicles can
54                                                      18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012


     and should be used to transport casualties to the CCP. The 18 MDG/CC or designated
     representative will make the decision to dispatch vehicle assets should the situation call.
     8.3.1.11. Inpatient casualty care is not available on Kadena. Any patients with injuries
     or illnesses that would require inpatient care will be simulated transported to USNHO.
     8.3.1.12. If fatalities are identified at a CCP, the Patient Care Team will notify the MCC
     to contact mortuary affairs. Mortuary affairs personnel will report to the appropriate CCP
     with their vehicle to take charge of fatalities once the medical authority releases them.
     8.3.1.13. All casualties will remain under the jurisdiction of medical personnel or
     mortuary affairs until released by medical/mortuary affairs authorities and an EET/XP
     member.
     8.3.1.14. Any equipment that must remain with the patient (for example, litters and
     moulage supplies) will be properly marked by the owning organization. All equipment
     will be returned to the owning unit following termination of the scenario.
     8.3.1.15. Patient Time Out. All casualties requiring hospitalization, aeromedical
     evacuation, or expiring during exercise play will not be eligible to return to play until the
     start of their next shift. This does not include minimally injured personnel who are
     returned to duty by a medical provider. Medical providers, via the MCC and Medical
     EOC Rep, will consult the MCBRNE EOC Rep (Bioenvironmental Engineering) to
     determine when casualties affected by threshold (non-lethal) concentrations of CBRN
     agents can effectively return to duty.
     8.3.1.16. Weapons:
        8.3.1.16.1. Weapons under the control of combatant (non-medical) personnel are not
        allowed in the medical facility. Whenever possible, combatant personnel should
        secure their weapons at their work site before reporting for medical care. If a casualty
        does arrive armed, the Medical Security Team will secure the weapon(s) and notify
        the MCC. The MCC will contact the EOC to coordinate retrieval or disposition of the
        weapon(s).
        8.3.1.16.2. The Medical Security Team is more likely to be issued weapons before
        other non-combatants for the purpose of defense of patients and medical staff.
        Weapons will be issued to the Medical Security Team if the local potential of
        insurgents or enemy forces may present a potential threat to staff or patients.
        8.3.1.16.3. Bioenvironmental Engineering personnel assigned as MCBRNE teams
        are also more likely to be issued weapons before other non-combatants for the
        purpose of self-defense. MCBRNE teams are at a much higher risk of being engaged
        by insurgents or enemy forces, as they are multisector roving teams. Weapons will be
        issued to the MCBRNE teams based on threat of insurgents or enemy forces to the
        entire installation or local area of responsibility, and not based solely on the potential
        threat to staff or patients at the medical facility.
     8.3.1.17. Combatant Status.
        8.3.1.17.1. Medical care providers (direct patient care and ancillary service providers
        and technicians) will not normally be assigned duties that could jeopardize their status
        as non-combatants.
18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                              55


         8.3.1.17.2. Medical personnel assigned to routine duties inside the EOC (Medical
         EOC Rep and Bioenvironmental Engineering/MCBRNE EOC Rep) are considered
         combatants for the duration of the exercise, as the EOC is a legitimate C2 target.
         8.3.1.17.3. MCBRNE teams co-located with, operating jointly with (i.e., not as an
         independent team), or in direct support of Civil Engineer Readiness CBRN Recon
         Teams, will be considered combatants for the duration of the exercise IAW
         HQ/USAF JAI Letter, Utilizing Bioenvironmental Engineering (BEE) Personnel as
         Members of Nuclear-Biological-Chemical Teams, dated 23 May 2000.
  8.3.2. Treatment of Contaminated Patients.
     8.3.2.1. Unit personnel will implement SABC procedures, including the administration
     of nerve agent/antidote, if warranted. Casualties will be decontaminated in the field to
     the maximum extent possible prior to arrival at MDG’s contaminated patient CCP.
     During Alarm Black, the casualties will be collected and will be transported to the CCP
     as the route is reported clear.
         8.3.2.1.1. Primary Decontamination: The responsibility for field decontamination
         lies with the first responders performing SABC.
         8.3.2.1.2. Secondary Decontamination: A patient decontamination team will be
         located in the parking lot adjacent to Bldg. 626. The decontamination team will be an
         appropriate distance from the Contaminated CCP. The patient decontamination team
         at the clinic is not supplied with new chemical protective gear for re-issue. The MCC
         will identify to the EOC the number of personnel requiring re-issue of chemical
         protective gear, to include the appropriate sizes of protective gear.
         8.3.2.1.3. At the Contaminated CCP, the casualties will be triaged outside in
         chemical protective gear once the ―all clear‖ has been given.
         8.3.2.1.4. The patient decontamination team is not mobile. All contaminated patients
         must be transported to the clinic via vehicles of opportunity.
     8.3.2.2. All casualties who are not immediately returned to duty will be reported to
     PERSCO.
  8.3.3. Patient Transportation. Medical assets are available during exercises, but that does
  not replace the importance of SABC. In order not to risk or disrupt real-world emergency
  response capability, the real-world ambulance will not be dispatched during the exercise,
  unless an exercise scenario becomes real world.
  8.3.4. Nerve Agent Antidote Issue Procedures.
     8.3.4.1. The Personnel Deployment Function (PDF) will process personnel deploying.
     Personnel will receive the necessary nerve agent/antidote simulation cards on the
     mobility processing line. Each card simulates a full complement of Biological Warfare
     (BW) and/or Chemical Warfare (CW) protection. Medical Logistics will issue the cards
     either individually or to the chalk troop commander depending on the scenario. Public
     Health personnel will describe and demonstrate the use of prophylactic medication and
     auto injectors as part of the pre-deployment briefing.
56                                                    18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012


     8.3.4.2. If the PDF is not operational, unit UDMs will make arrangements through
     Medical Logistics to obtain the supplies for their personnel. Medical Logistics will
     provide these individuals with necessary simulation cards. Issuance instructions will be
     provided in the form of a CSD.
     8.3.4.3. The decision to begin, continue, or discontinue administration of nerve agent
     prophylactic medication, IAW AFJMAN 44-149, Treatment Of Chemical Agent
     Casualties And Conventional Military Chemical Injuries will be made by the wing
     commander. The MDG/CC, his representative, SMEs, medical intelligence officer and
     Civil Engineering Emergency Management, will serve in an advisory capacity.
  8.3.5. Heat Injury Prevention/Work/Rest Cycles.
     8.3.5.1. Work/rest cycles and flag conditions will vary according to the Wet Bulb Globe
     Temperature (WBGT). Bioenvironmental Engineering (BEE) personnel will monitor the
     WBGT conditions throughout any exercise.
         8.3.5.1.1. Information will be passed through the EOC and Command Staff, and
         posted on the heat stress web page via the Kadena Homepage for base-wide access.
         Heat stress conditions will be reported for both non-exercise players as well as
         exercise players. Conditions will account for MOPP and individual protective gear
         (body armor and helmet) as well as variations (such as the ventilation option and no-
         BDU option) in effect per CSD. Work-rest cycles posted on the heat stress webpage
         will be observed based on the current flag condition in effect.
         8.3.5.1.2. In the event the webpage is not operational, BEE will recommend
         work/rest cycles to the EOC. Work/rest cycles will then be released by CSD.
     8.3.5.2. Injects may occur that simulate medical symptoms of heat stress illnesses for the
     purposes of evaluating unit SABC ability.
     8.3.5.3. The workplace or line supervisor or wingman is authorized to remove an
     individual’s MOPP gear (including the gas mask) in the event of, or in the immediate
     danger of a real-world medical emergency. When the situation allows, the nearest
     EET/XP member will be notified and real-world emergency services will be activated.
     For non-emergency situations, any unit CC is authorized to determine an individual’s
     ability to continue in the exercise, and may request medical assistance in making said
     determination. Individuals deemed unable to continue with the exercise will remove
     MOPP gear as required, and be directed to report immediately to the MTF as a real-world
     patient. Unit CC’s will notify the EOC and EET/XP. Medical providers will determine
     when the individual may return to duty, and notify the unit CC. The individual’s unit
     control center will notify the EOC of when the individual is expected to return to their
     unit.
  8.3.6. MCBRNE Team.
     8.3.6.1. The MCBRNE team will stage and operate out of Bldg. 428 unless re-positioned
     closer to flight line at the request of the EOC or Command Staff. Operational control of
     the MCBRNE team will be the responsibility of the MCBRNE/BEE EOC Representative.
     8.3.6.2. All members of the MCBRNE team will be provided improved individual
     protective equipment as soon as reasonably available.
18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                 57


       8.3.6.3. The MCBRNE team will maintain flight line access (restricted area badges and
       flight line drivers training) as soon as in-processing the Bioenvironmental Engineering
       Flight. Personnel are authorized to apply for MOPP 4 driver certification. In the event
       no personnel on the current shift are qualified to drive in MOPP 4, the driver of the team
       may remove gas mask for safety purposes while driving. Upon arrival at destination, the
       driver will resume MOPP 4 before proceeding with the assessment mission.
       8.3.6.4. EET/XP will ensure simulated sample results are provided to the MCBRNE
       team once the assessment portion is accomplished. Sample results collected successfully
       will be consistent to the type and degree of agent used during the attack.
       8.3.6.5. For the purposes of time compression, exercise health risk assessments will be
       considered completed when the EOC has provided EET/XP reasonable solutions for each
       of the following criteria:
          8.3.6.5.1. Immediate actions to protect personnel from further residual exposure.
          8.3.6.5.2. Actions that would be taken to maintain operational effectiveness despite
          manning degradation from exposures (if any occur based on EET inject).
          8.3.6.5.3. Plan to mitigate or reduce residual agent hazard (based on MCBRNE and
          CEX recommendations) and minimize future potential personnel exposure.
       8.3.6.6. If armed and in non-combatant status, MCBRNE team members will display
       medical insignia and observe Law of Armed Conflict principles. Members may report,
       but not engage, hostile forces unless fired upon first.
       8.3.6.7. Due to extreme cost and sensitivity, advanced detection equipment used by the
       MCBRNE team will not be subjected to decontamination for the purpose of exercises.
       The MCBRNE team will demonstrate knowledge of decontaminating their equipment.
8.4. Base X. This section only addresses differences from the FTB construct.
   8.4.1. Ambulance support for real-world in-flight emergencies (IFEs) will be provided by
   Kadena AB Clinic assets.
   8.4.2. The notional Expeditionary Medical Support system (EMEDS) must operate in a high-
   threat environment and respond to simulated air/ground conventional, chemical, and
   biological attacks.
   8.4.3. The 18 MDG EMEDS will simulate an EMEDS +25 at Bldg. 920. For purposes of
   the exercise, the notional EMEDS +25 provides simulated 24-hour medical care
   commensurate with an EMEDs +25 including MCC, aeromedical evacuation preparation,
   and Team Aerospace Services (SGPB and SGPF).
   8.4.4. The following medical functions will support Base X medical functions: MCC,
   Patient Decontamination, SMEs, Bioenvironmental Engineering, and Patient Administration.
   Patients will enter EMEDS, and at appropriate time intervals then be discharged with the
   desired exercise input of RTD, deceased, or requiring aeromedical evacuation. Patient status
   will be immediately provided to PERSCO and Mortuary Affairs to facilitate their respective
   parts of the LORE.
   8.4.5. Casualty Processing. All casualties will be transported to the EMEDS CCP using
   vehicles of opportunity. The expectation will be that units will transport their simulated
 58                                                     18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012


   casualties to the EMEDS +25. Initially, casualties will be brought to the CCP and will be
   triaged as contaminated versus uncontaminated.            After appropriate decontamination
   simulated casualties will be brought into the EMEDS +25 (Bldg. 920) for treatment.
   Simulated patients then enter the EMEDS for simulated care, and then are discharged to the
   three categories as above (returned to duty, deceased or aeromedically evacuated to higher
   echelons of care). The EMEDS +25 will have administrative personnel to perform the
   appropriate patient administration functions to medically process and properly record a
   disposition the patient.       The administrative paperwork collected by the Patient
   Administration Team will be used to report personnel status to PERSCO after NLT 60 hours.
   After the established holding period, disposition will occur as defined above.
   8.4.6. EMEDS Leadership. Base X medical assets will fall under the control of the Base
   Director of Medical Services. EMEDS +25 will have a Deputy EMEDS Commander (DEC)
   who will oversee EMEDS +25 operations at Bldg. 920 and all other medical assets at that
   location. The DEC will make the final casualty disposition decision in conjunction with the
   EET needs to support the exercise. DECs do not have to be providers, but will be officers
   and competent medical authorities. Proper processing of these casualties will be performed
   IAW established protocols from the MDG/CC.
   8.4.7. Inpatient hospital facilities will be simulated to be an EMEDS facility at Bldg. 920
   with definitive care services available. Any patients with injuries or illnesses that would
   require inpatient care would be simulated transported to this facility.
   8.4.8. The SME teams will provide patient care to the maximum extent possible; however,
   care may be extremely limited without the hospital. Emphasis will be placed on protecting
   patients and staff from potential contaminants and to transporting casualties to a higher
   echelon medical facility 60 minutes away.
   8.4.9. Under no circumstances will exercise casualties be brought to the 18 MDG Clinic,
   Bldg. 626 on Kadena AB.
   8.4.10. The 44 PAX Ambulatory Bus (AMBUS) located at the Base X EMEDS will only be
   used to support relocation of EMEDS personnel to their alternate facility. There is no patient
   transportation capability at the Base X EMEDS.
8.5. Chaplain. The responsibilities, needs and uses of Chapel Service Team (CST) are as
follows:
   8.5.1. Establish a centralized high-visibility office between the CST and the Kadena
   community. The office will afford privacy and confidentiality for counseling on a 24-hour
   basis.
   8.5.2. Due to Kadena’s large area and the necessity for immediate response to areas of
   greatest need, a vehicle should be provided to the chaplain staff to support their various
   ministries.
   8.5.3. Due to the continual need for a chaplain's presence at a moment’s notice, day or night,
   it is requested that two (2) LMRs be issued to the Senior Chaplain assigned. These radios
   will expedite a quick response from any location on the base in case of an emergency. To
   foster coordination with the medical team, it is recommended these LMRs be programmed
   with the Medical Network frequencies.
18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                             59


  8.5.4. Additional services provided by the CST will include worship service opportunities,
  individual counseling, sacraments and rites, and the distribution of religious and morale-
  lifting literature.
  8.5.5. IAW AFI 52-101, paragraph 2.1.3, Chaplains and Chaplains Assistants are non-
  combatants and will not be placed in any duty status that compromises their status as non-
  combatants. IAW AFI 52-101, paragraph 2.2.2., Chaplain Assistants are combatants and are
  responsible for providing security for chaplains. As such, IAW AFI 52-101, paragraph 2.2.1,
  Chaplain Assistants are exempt from details or duties that impede Chaplain Service mission
  accomplishment.

                                            Chapter 9

                                          LOGISTICS

9.1. FTB.
   9.1.1. Supply.
      9.1.1.1. In order to ensure proper and accurate processing of supply transactions between
      the deployed Combat Supply Activity and the Standard Base Supply System (SBSS),
      these instructions contain guidance and responsibilities for the following programs:
      readiness spares package (RSP) replenishment, mission capability (MICAP), evacuation
      of repairables, storage aid issue of chemical warfare defense equipment (CWDE), fuel
      support, and equipment management element destroyed/damaged assets. Procedures for
      weapons/ammunition control will be covered in Chapter 14.
      9.1.1.2. These instructions are designed to specifically address operations for which
      home station replenishment and MICAP support have been declared. Where EXPlan or
      OPLAN procedures conflict with day-to-day operations, the EXPlan/OPLAN instructions
      will take precedence.
      9.1.1.3. These instructions assume that a post-post operation under the Combat Oriented
      Supply Operation (COSO) concept will be utilized. Manual accounting procedures are
      contained in AFMAN 23-110 and will be used when the SBSS is inoperative for an
      extended period. The Post-Post Control Team Chief will declare conversion from
      manual accounting to the CPS and vice-versa.
      9.1.1.4. Requirement Submissions to Customer Service.
            9.1.1.4.1. Supply requirements will be satisfied by Customer Service on a fill-or-kill
            basis.
            9.1.1.4.2. For aircraft MICAP zero-balance conditions, the Support Section will
            adhere to PACAF Regional Supply Squadron (RSS) procedures set forth in PACAFI
            23-207. Message submission requirements will be formatted IAW AFMAN 23-110’s
            manual accounting procedures.
      9.1.1.5. EME Destroyed Equipment Replacement.
            9.1.1.5.1. All equipment assets are subject to being listed as destroyed equipment.
            9.1.1.5.2. The custodian will notify the supply equipment representative upon
            discovery or notification of destroyed or damaged equipment assets.              The
            representative will require the NSN, Equipment Detail, quantity, and serial number of
            the equipment. Supply personnel will conduct priority sourcing to obtain a
            replacement for the unserviceable asset. A message will be sent to 7 AF/LGS,
            PACAF CAT, 18 LRS/LGRSC, or PACAF RSS/LGSME requesting emergency
            replacement of the indicated assets. Equipment custodians will be notified and
            required to sign for receipt of replacement equipment assets upon their arrival.
      9.1.1.6. Post-Post Processing. After the exercise is terminated, the Aircraft Parts
      Store/Readiness Spares Package Element (18 LRS/LGRMA-1/2) will ensure any and all
18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                61


     post-post transactions are processed into the Kadena SBSS. Real-world deployments
     take precedence over exercises.
     9.1.1.7. CWDE C-Bag.
         9.1.1.7.1. Bulk CWDE replacements assets will be palletized and tariff-sized by the
         18 LRS personnel.
         9.1.1.7.2. MICAS will be utilized to account for all bulk CWDE assets. If the
         MICAS program is not available, AF Forms 1297 will be used to issue, track, and
         account for bulk assets.
     9.1.1.8. Communication Requirements.
         9.1.1.8.1. The 18 LRS requires one Class A line in each office and two in the
         warehouse. Two RJ-45 data grade lines are also required in the warehouse.
  9.1.2. Fuels.
     9.1.2.1. In the event the primary, alternate and tertiary fuels locations are
     damaged/destroyed, line supervisors/expediters will perform command and control
     functions from mobile general-purpose vehicles or best available facility. Fuels support
     requests will then be made through the Fuels line supervisors/expediters via mobile
     radios. Refueling assets will be dispersed to key locations, thus ensuring asset protection
     and rapid response.
     9.1.2.2. Liquid Oxygen (LOX) and Liquid Nitrogen (LIN) cart fills remain a
     maintenance responsibility. The 18 WG LRS/LGRF may provide fire guard assistance if
     manning allows.
     9.1.2.3. When refueling units are not in use, they will be dispersed as determined by the
     POL supervisor to different locations. Due to the limited number of aircraft shelters, the
     refuelers will park in any vacant protective aircraft shelter, flow-through or hard stand.
     9.1.2.4. Bldg 3135 will be the primary location for lab personnel to analyze samples.
     The Area Lab in Bldg. 845 can be used as an alternate facility.
     9.1.2.5. Upon notification of Alarm BLUE/RED, all fuels personnel will take immediate
     cover and, if a MOPP level is declared, don appropriate CWDE ensemble. If Alarm
     BLUE/RED occurs during a fuel servicing operation, personnel will immediately cease
     operations (unless providing real support), close truck vents, shut-off engine, and ensure
     the single point nozzle is disconnected from the aircraft prior to taking cover and donning
     CWDE ensemble. If driving, the vehicle operator will find the nearest safe area to park,
     (i.e. designated protective shelter, revetment, or edge of the taxi way) remain in the
     vehicle, and don CWDE ensemble avoiding interference with aircraft movement. All
     personnel will remain under cover until notified that a change in operation conditions has
     occurred.
  9.1.3. Transportation.
     9.1.3.1. Phase I consists of mobility, support for the Passenger Deployment Function
     (PDF), the Air Passenger Terminal (APT), and the Cargo Deployment Function (CDF).
     Additionally, Emergency Management Exercise (EME), NEO, and Reception Processing
     Unit (RPU) require substantial transportation support. The Sub Motor Pool (SMP) is
62                                                     18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012


     established and works out of Vehicle Operations, to support ground transportation for the
     aforementioned functions and reports to the ID/RCC.
     9.1.3.2. The complete range of transportation support for Phase I (TMO, Vehicle
     Maintenance, Vehicle Operations, Combat Readiness) is provided as needed. 18 LRS is
     the process owner for the APT, CDF and SMP and provides personnel/equipment
     resources. Additional equipment will be sourced by Fleet Management to meet
     operational requirements.
     9.1.3.3. Arriving forces will be transported by the SMP from the aircraft to the RPU.
     SMP will provide a representative to the RPU to coordinate all transportation
     requirements from the RPU to individual’s lodging/work centers. Additionally, Vehicle
     Operations will establish a shuttle to transport personnel between their lodging locations
     and work centers. The amount of shuttles, locations of stops, and duration are predicated
     on the number of personnel arriving, lodging/work center locations, and length of
     contingency, respectively.
     9.1.3.4. All personnel baggage (and training C-1 bag if approved) will be turned into the
     Personnel Deployment Function (PDF) for pallet processing. PAX and pallets will be
     moved as directed by SMP. At the conclusion of the exercise, it is each unit’s
     responsibility to ensure all baggage pallets and nets are returned to their proper location.
     If units lack the capability to return baggage pallets/nets or other cargo, contact
     transportation.
  9.1.4. Vehicle Maintenance.
     9.1.4.1. In the event the primary, alternate and tertiary locations for vehicle maintenance
     are damaged/destroyed, command and control functions will be performed from the
     mobile maintenance teams or best available facility. Vehicle support requests will be
     taken via mobile radios or other available means. Mobile trucks will be dispersed to key
     locations to expedite response.
     9.1.4.2. Vehicles which require towing will be retrieved and turned into Vehicle
     Maintenance by Vehicle Operations personnel.            Those vehicles which require
     maintenance, but can still be operated, will be turned in for maintenance by the owning
     unit.
     9.1.4.3. Vehicle Maintenance will use the current base Vehicle Authorization List for
     vehicle requirements.
     9.1.4.4. Vehicle Operator Responsibilities. All operators are responsible for identifying,
     marking, and reporting contaminated vehicles. Contamination markers will be affixed.
     The following information will be entered into the vehicle’s Operator’s Inspection Guide
     and Trouble Report (AF 1800): date and time contamination occurred, type of
     contamination, location of vehicle, and where contamination is located on the vehicle if
     possible. Operators will report contaminated vehicle numbers to their organization’s
     UCC. The report will include registration number, type of vehicle, date and time
     contamination occurred, type of contamination, and where contamination is located on
     the vehicle if possible.
18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                63


      9.1.4.5. Unit Responsibilities. Vehicle using organizations are responsible for reporting
      their contaminated vehicles by registration number to the EOC.
      9.1.4.6. EOC Responsibilities. The EOC is responsible for compiling reported data on
      contaminated vehicles and forwarding the data to the LRS or equivalent UCC.
      9.1.4.7. LRS UCC Responsibilities. The LRS or LRS-equivalent UCC is responsible for
      providing contaminated vehicle data reports to both vehicle management and vehicle
      operations. The LRS UCC will provide a minimum of daily updates to the list.
      9.1.4.8. Mission-Critical Contaminated Vehicles. Critical vehicles required for mission
      essential activities may be determined usable by the 18 WG/CC. Sortie generating, sortie
      sustaining, emergency response, and force protection vehicles are examples of such
      assets. Contaminated vehicles identified as mission essential will be operated and
      serviced under the same requirements as when performing contingency maintenance
9.2. Base X.
   9.2.1. Supply.
      9.2.1.1. Applicability: This section applies to deployed supply resources within Base X
      and home station activities in support of Base X functions, and only addresses areas that
      differ from the FTB construct.
      9.2.1.2. These instructions are designed to specifically address deployed operations for
      which home station replenishment and MICAP support have been declared. Where
      EXPLAN or OPLAN procedures conflict with day-to-day operations, the
      EXPLAN/OPLAN instructions will take precedence.
      9.2.1.3. Combat Supply Activity (CSA). The Chief of Supply (COS) will deploy a CSA
      supervisor and at least two additional qualified 2S0X1 whenever an RSP is deployed.
      Personnel simulated as in place forces will assist in RSP management until deploying
      RSP personnel have arrived to cover both shifts.
          9.2.1.3.1. Supply requirements will be satisfied from the CSA-deployed assets first
          and on a ―fill or kill‖ basis.
          9.2.1.3.2. For aircraft MICAP zero balance conditions, the deployed Support Section
          will adhere to PACAF Regional Supply Squadron (RSS) procedures set forth in
          PACAFI 23-207. (NOTE: The CSA will perform interim duties of the FSSS if
          arriving at the deployed location prior to FSSS personnel.) Message submission
          requirements will be formatted IAW AFMAN 23-110’s manual accounting
          procedures.
      9.2.1.4. Issue of Tanks, Racks, Adapters, and Pylons (TRAP). Supply personnel will
      prepare all issue documentation and obtain signature from requiring organizational
      representative. If an out-of-balance condition exists for a required TRAP asset, personnel
      will conduct priority sourcing to locate assets. A message will be transmitted to
      PACAF/Osan and customer will be notified upon arrival of required assets. AMU
      production supervision needs to immediately notify supply personnel whenever there is
      external fuel tank expenditure. The maintenance representative responsible for tank
      build-up team personnel must know the external fuel tank requirements prior to tank
      build-up team employment.
64                                                     18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012


     9.2.1.5. Parts availability. For forward deployed aircraft, if the part is in the MRSP it
     will be made available to the requestor immediately. If the part is not in the MRSP, but is
     available at Kadena, the part will be made available immediately but the aircraft will not
     be made available for exercise use until after an additional 12 hour part delivery
     simulation is enforced. Parts will be made available to the requestor immediately for units
     not tasked to deploy during the exercise.
     9.2.1.6. CWDE C-Bag.
         9.2.1.6.1. Bulk CWDE replacements assets will be palletized and tariff sized for bulk
         shipment to Base X by the 18th LRS personnel. Pallets will be moved from 18 LRS
         directly to K5-Right for scheduled marshaling.
         9.2.1.6.2. The Base X EOC will coordinate through the LRS control center for the
         movement of bulk CWDE assets to the designated decontamination center.
  9.2.2. Fuels. This section contains guidance for fuels operations at Base X.
     9.2.2.1. Deployed Fuels Organization: The LRS/CC will deploy a senior 2F0XX as the
     POL supervisor. The POL supervisor will be directly subordinate to the deployed
     LRS/CC. Until the arrival of the senior ranking 2F0XX, the Fuels cadre team member
     will fill this position. This will ensure prompt response to aircraft fuel requests upon
     arrival at the deployed location.
     9.2.2.2. During Phase II, Fuels personnel working inside the confines of Base X will play
     as in-place personnel deployed personnel from a number of notional bases.
  9.2.3. Transportation.
     9.2.3.1. Transition from Phase I to Phase II (Base X Support). Transportation support
     provided during PHASE II (Base X) must be specifically defined. The following
     guidelines apply.
         9.2.3.1.1. All personnel baggage (and training C-1 bag if approved) will be turned in
         to the PDF) for pallet processing. Once built, the pallets will be moved directly to the
         Base X reception/processing area. Mobility personnel will be transported from the
         PDF to the Base X reception/processing area at PAX load start time. APT
         representative will call the IDRC Transportation Rep and schedule a bus for PAX
         pick-up at load time. Base X resources will be used to disperse personnel from the
         processing area to their work centers inside of Base X. At the conclusion of the
         exercise, it is each unit’s responsibility to ensure all baggage pallets and nets are
         returned to their proper location. If units lack the capability to return baggage
         pallets/nets or other cargo, contact Base X transportation.
         9.2.3.1.2. Mobility Cargo. Cargo will remain at the cargo yard, K-5 Right, until
         projected aircraft departure time or released by XP. The SMP will deliver cargo in
         chalk sequence.
             9.2.3.1.2.1. Baggage will be delivered to the Base X Personnel Reception Area.
             A Placard will be placed on the cargo/bags by CDRF personnel stating ―Aircraft
             Simulated in flight will arrive Base X at __________, do not open until then.‖
             The simulated flight time will be 2 ½ hours.
18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                  65


            9.2.3.1.2.2. Base X transportation personnel will deliver cargo to designated
            locations. It is still the owning unit’s responsibility for transporting rolling stock
            from K5-Right to their work area. Baggage will be delivered to the Base X
            personnel reception area. Bags must be dropped off at Base X in an orderly
            manner (no mixing between chalks). Also, bags need to remain weather protected
            until claimed (under a shelter or wrapped).
            9.2.3.1.2.3. Deploying personnel should claim their bags immediately upon
            completion of in-processing prior to departing for crew rest.
            9.2.3.1.2.4. At the conclusion of the exercise, transportation personnel will return
            baggage pallets/nets to Bldg. 792 and cargo pallets/nets to Bldg. 780 (Hangar 2).
            The transportation supervisor at Base X will direct this activity and ensure all
            pallets and nets are returned to their proper location.
     9.2.3.2. Phase I transportation manning requirements normally take precedence over
     Phase II requirements. When Phase I and the standup of Base X are occurring
     simultaneously, Phase I requirements will receive priority based on cadre/CC, MSG/CC,
     and 18 WG/CC coordination. Base X manpower is sourced from Kadena resources to
     represent UTC capabilities which would be sourced from other locations. During these
     situations, Base X will be minimally manned to support reception of cargo and personnel.
     Full Base X manning will not occur until Phase I is complete and personnel have been
     provided required rest.
     9.2.3.3. Base X Transportation CONOPS.
        9.2.3.3.1. One cadre member and three permanent party transportation personnel are
        available at the COB. Together, these limited transportation resources at Base X
        cannot provide the basic services needed to approximate the operating conditions at
        the COB. The majority of transportation manpower UTCs identified for the COB is
        sourced from locations other than Kadena. However, based on TPFDD data, a
        substantial number of these resources will be available to support COB operations
        early during a contingency. The following is a total list of transportation personnel
        resources who will be identified as Base X players to ensure at least minimum
        transportation support capabilities exist within Base X
            9.2.3.3.1.1. Personnel located at Base X:
               9.2.3.3.1.1.1. 2T370 (1) Vehicle Maintenance QAE
               9.2.3.3.1.1.2. 2T357 (1) Vehicle Maintenance Controller

            9.2.3.3.1.2. Personnel deploying from Kadena to Base X:
               9.2.3.3.1.2.1. 2T151 (1) cadre Vehicle Operations
               9.2.3.3.1.2.2. 2T251 (4) Air Transportation Personnel
            9.2.3.3.1.3. Personnel at Base X to simulate incoming TPFDD forces:
               9.2.3.3.1.3.1. 2T151 (10) Vehicle Operator (These personnel will folder-only
               process the PDF)
66                                                18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012


            9.2.3.3.1.3.2. 2T354 (1) General Purpose Mechanic
            9.2.3.3.1.3.3. 2T351 (1) Special Purpose Mechanic
     9.2.3.3.2. All transportation functions with the exception of Traffic Management will
     participate in Base X play. Vehicles which require towing will be retrieved and
     turned into Kadena Vehicle Maintenance by Base X Vehicle Operations personnel.
     Those vehicles which require maintenance, but can still be operated, will be turned in
     for maintenance by the owning unit.
     9.2.3.3.3. Base X Vehicle Requirements and Use Policy.             Base X specific
     requirements will include a separate Vehicle Authorization List.
        9.2.3.3.3.1. It is assumed that all authorized vehicles which are not military
        unique are available on Base X. Vehicles that are military unique are restricted to
        the number of assets actually assigned, along with any that are identified as part
        of inbound UTCs. Examples of military unique vehicles include aircraft tow
        tractors and MHE.
        9.2.3.3.3.2. All substitutes and asset realignments will reflect real-world
        capabilities (i.e. a pickup can sub for a metro, a bobtail cannot sub as a pick-up,
        an MB4 cannot sub as an MB2, etc.). EET has final say on any substitution
        disagreements.
        9.2.3.3.3.3. Base X Fuels cadre members control vehicle refueling procedures.
        Base X units should contact Base X Fuels for times and locations for vehicle
        refueling.
     9.2.3.3.4. The 18 LRS will establish shuttle bus services as necessary for
     transportation of personnel around Base X.

        12.1.2.4.1. Munitions Receipts via Air Shipment.
            12.1.2.4.1.1. Upon notification, Munitions Control will coordinate with Storage
            to dispatch 40-foot/MHU-110 trailers and drivers to pick up shipment. Empty
            AURCs or munitions containers will be pre-positioned on trailers.
            12.1.2.4.1.2. Drivers and shotguns will proceed to Hot Cargo Pad Bravo to pick
            up munitions. The 18 LRS will provide forklift support for this operation.
            NOTE: Munitions Operations personnel authorized in writing will inventory
            assets and receive them on accountable record.
            12.1.2.4.1.3. After arrival at the cargo pad, assets will be half-up/downloaded to
76                                                     18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012


            demonstrate loading of trailers. Once completed, drivers will deliver loaded
            trailers to Bldg. 47801, PGM, or designated operating location, if required for
            immediate build-up or to the appropriate dispersal location(s) for storage. Assets
            will be half-up/downloaded to demonstrate delivery. This procedure will be
            repeated as many times as necessary to demonstrate delivery of all munitions to
            the storage area.
        12.1.2.4.2. Munitions Receipts via International Organization Standardization (ISO)
        Shipment.
            12.1.2.4.2.1. A predetermined quantity of ISO containers will be pre-stuffed prior
            to ORE/I STARTEX and staged where space and net explosive weight limits
            allow. Munitions loads will replicate a mix of PGM, complete round
            configurations, and bulk conventional munitions to the greatest extent possible.
            12.1.2.4.2.2. Upon execution of tasked OPLAN, ensure 18 LRS coordinates ISO
            shipment operations at Tengan Pier with US Army’s 1315th Medium Port
            Command and contract ground transportation to line haul from the pier.
            12.1.2.4.2.3. TMO (18 LRS), Munitions Operations and Inspection will be at In-
            check to receive incoming assets.
            12.1.2.4.2.4. Delivery priority of received munitions. If assets require immediate
            build-up, drivers will deliver ISO containers to operating locations for download,
            de-stuff and build. ISO containers can be placed where space and net explosive
            weight limits allow. If not needed for current operations, munitions should be de-
            stuffed and stored in appropriate storage location.
            12.1.2.4.2.5. Empty ISO containers and blocking/bracing will be removed and
            delivered to the PACAF CE Silver Flag area.
     12.1.2.5. Munitions Shipments.
        12.1.2.5.1. Munitions Shipments via Airlift.
            12.1.2.5.1.1. At the direction of 18 MUNS supervision, build up of pallet trains
            (T-2) or any other anticipated air out load assets may be directed.
            12.1.2.5.1.2. Utilize the warning period to conduct minimal, low visibility build-
            up of these time critical air takings.
            12.1.2.5.1.3. Quantities and munitions types for pallet build-up will be
            determined at warning order. To the maximum extent possible, air out load
            TPFDD assets (as well as some other expected out load assets) may be kept in a
            pre-palletized condition. Therefore, no additional build-up of some assets will
            actually be needed.
            12.1.2.5.1.4. When possible, it is recommended to require the build-up of some
            assets from stocks to verify capability, proficiency, logistics and planning, and
            provide adequate training.
               12.1.2.5.1.4.1. If no munitions are available in stock for build-up, a teardown
               and build up of existing items may be needed to accomplish this.
18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                               77


               12.1.2.5.1.4.2. An alternative would be to use empty AUR containers
               (AURC) to simulate live assets (requires coordination with EET).
           12.1.2.5.1.5. Procedures. Lot selection will be performed by Munitions Storage,
           Inspection and Operations personnel immediately upon receipt of any air out load
           tasking.
               12.1.2.5.1.5.1. Once selection is accomplished for the first UTC, Munitions
               Operations will immediately generate shipment documentation.
               12.1.2.5.1.5.2. Precision Guided Munitions will provide TMRS support for
               outbound shipments. Lot selection for the remaining UTCs can occur
               simultaneously with multiple selection teams; however, the objective is to
               complete lot selection as soon as possible without delaying the process for the
               initial UTCs.
               12.1.2.5.1.5.3. Materiel Flight personnel will conduct pallet build-up
               operations at the structures that contain the missiles being out loaded or as an
               option, may deliver AURCs to other operating locations (Bldg. 43811, 43812,
               etc.) for palletization and chain-gating.
           12.1.2.5.1.6. Building pallet trains on dunnage is the preferred method.
               12.1.2.5.1.6.1. In the event that 22K forklift support is unavailable, aircraft
               pallet trains will be pre-positioned on 40-ft rollerized trailers and personnel
               will upload AURCs onto pallet trains only. Non T-2 pallets for air out load
               may be loaded on flatbed 40-ft trailers (requires pallet handling support on
               flight line), but preferred mode is by rollerized trailer.
           12.1.2.5.1.7. Start and stop times for pallet build, marshalling, JI and delivery
           will be called into Munitions Control for tracking of status.
           12.1.2.5.1.8. Munitions Control will ensure the DRCC is notified of all start and
           stop times to facilitate 18 LRS Marshal and 733 AMS JI support.
        12.1.2.5.2. Munitions Shipments via Break Bulk.
           12.1.2.5.2.1. For break bulk taskings, no movement is required unless 18 WG
           EET/XP indicates that the ship is at the pier ready to load munitions.
           12.1.2.5.2.2. Only lot selection, verification, documentation, and labeling of the
           tasked munitions are necessary. Lot selection will be performed by Munitions
           Storage, Inspection, Operations and Conventional Maintenance.
           12.1.2.5.2.3. If pier delivery operations are directed, the requirements for
           personnel and vehicles needed along the route and at the pier will be set aside as a
           simulation.
           12.1.2.5.2.4. The 18 WG EET/XP is required to serve as Pier Controllers, and
           request each asset be delivered, as determined by its cube, type, etc. Only at this
           point will TMO, Munitions Inspection and Munitions Operations personnel man
           the in-check station. Munitions will be half-loaded onto trailers, secured,
           placarded, and then immediately downloaded back to the storage location.
78                                                    18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012


            12.1.2.5.2.5. As an exception, the first 10 trailer loads may be fully loaded and
            routed through in-check for inspection.
        12.1.2.5.3. Munitions Shipments via ISO Container.
            12.1.2.5.3.1. ISO/CADS. Lot selection will be performed by Munitions Storage,
            Inspection, Operations Conventional Maintenance and Fabrication.
            12.1.2.5.3.2. The exercise tasking for ISO out load can be met by using pre-
            built/pre-stuffed ISOs, stuffing ISOs with munitions using pre-built blocking &
            bracing, and/or building blocking & bracing from wood supplies then stuffing
            ISOs with munitions.
               12.1.2.5.3.2.1. All tasked quantities will be placed in the ISOs, inspected,
               documented, placarded and moved to a properly sited staging area.
            12.1.2.5.3.3. Any stenciling requirements for labeling ISOs will typically be
            demonstrated with masking tape and markers.
            12.1.2.5.3.4. Delivery is not required unless 18 WG EET/XP directs that a ship is
            at the pier ready to begin loading operations. Only at that point will TMO,
            Munitions Inspection and Munitions Operations personnel man the in-check
            station.
            12.1.2.5.3.5. Personnel and vehicles needed along the route and at the pier will be
            set aside as a simulation.
            12.1.2.5.3.6. ISOs will be loaded onto the ISO trailers. The first ISO of each
            Cargo Increment Number may be routed through in-check, inspected, then return
            to the storage location for download.
            12.1.2.5.3.7. To demonstrate delivery of the tasked ISOs to the pier, the
            procedures in para 12.1.2.6.2. will be followed.
     12.1.2.6. Simulated Delivery of Outload Munitions.
        12.1.2.6.1. Simulated delivery of air deployed munitions.
            12.1.2.6.1.1. Minimal movement of munitions is expected to reduce mishap
            potential. However, a limited movement may be directed to demonstrate build-up
            completion, delivery capability, procedures, and adequate resources.
            12.1.2.6.1.2. Unless otherwise directed, loaded T-2 trailers will only be used to
            demonstrate delivery to the flight line. All other assets will be half up/down
            loaded and remain at the build-up/marshalling site, and their delivery will be
            demonstrated with an empty trailer. Deliveries to the flight line will be
            demonstrated by directing the required crew, with tractor/trailer, to a designated
            location. They will remain there for the time it would take to deliver, offload, and
            return to the Munitions Storage Area (MSA). This time will be one hour from
            arrival. Other locations may be needed to prevent compatibility or net explosive
            weight violations.
            12.1.2.6.1.3. EET evaluators may conduct acceptance inspections at any location.
            Once released, palletized missiles may be returned to original facility and be
18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                  79


            broken down.
            12.1.2.6.1.4. The number of demonstrated ―deliveries‖ must match the total air
            out load tasking.
        12.1.2.6.2. Simulated delivery of surface (sea) deployed munitions (Break Bulk and
        ISO).
            12.1.2.6.2.1. Minimal actual movements should be conducted. Also, as stated
            previously, this paragraph only applies if pier operations have begun, as directed
            by 18 WG EET/XP.
            12.1.2.6.2.2. After a real load is processed through in-check then downloaded
            back at its original holding/storage area, the tractor, trailer and delivery crew will
            be held in a designated area for the time needed to demonstrate delivery, offload
            and return from the pier.
            12.1.2.6.2.3. Materiel Flight Supervision will designate this holding area and
            inform Munitions Control. The demonstrated hold time will be 2 hours for all sea
            out loads to Tengan pier. The time will be determined for other locations as
            required.
     12.1.2.7. Munitions Accountability.
        12.1.2.7.1. Munitions accountability will be accomplished using the Combat
        Ammunition System (CAS). Higher headquarters shall determine the format and
        content of required items for Munitions Reporting (MUREP) and shall forward this
        information to Munitions Operations personnel. Munitions Operations personnel
        shall complete this report as often as requested by higher headquarters (typically once
        per day) and forward it in the correct format.
        12.1.2.7.2. Accountability of expended missiles will be maintained with a
        communications triad consisting of Munitions Control, Alternate Control and Flight
        line Super/Viper/Weapons Super. The Weapons Super unit will request specific re-
        supply requirements from control by code name and all information will be
        documented simultaneously by the triad. Munitions Control and Alternate Control
        will log all missile uploads to include spot and trailer number. Quantities will be
        verified upon reload of trailers at the missile re-supply location.
        12.1.2.7.3. Reconciliation will be accomplished not later than two hours after the last
        aircraft down (unless impeded by simulate airfield attacks, at which time
        reconciliation will be accomplished as soon as possible when cleared to continue
        working). Weapons expediters will track simulated and actual expenditures on
        separate 18WG Forms 62, Munitions Configuration and Expenditure Document (one
        clearly marked ―Exercise‖ and one ―Real World‖). If there are discrepancies noted
        on the 18WG Form 62, Flight Line Super/Viper and Weapons Super will compare
        information to transaction histories, expenditure reports or the AF IMT 4331,
        Munitions Transaction Sheet. The munitions superintendent will keep the Operations
        and Maintenance Group Commanders informed of on-hand balances and re-supply
        when needed.

        12.1.2.7.4. Missile expenditures and uploads to aircraft will be called in to Munitions
        Control by missile tail number. Air-to-ground expenditures and uploads to aircraft
        will be called in to Munitions Control by build code.
        12.1.2.7.5. All real-world chaff/flare/20mm expenditures will be processed in real
        CAS following normal day-to-day procedures. Simulated air-to-air and air-to-ground
        expenditures will be processed in training CAS. Munitions Operations will collect
        the necessary expended quantities from both databases to accomplish the MUREP.
     12.1.2.8. Emergency Destruction of Munitions.
        12.1.2.8.1. Procedures IAW T.O. 11A-1-42, General Instructions-Disposal of
        Ammunition, will be adhered to.

        munitions will be demonstrated by any suitable material.
        12.1.2.8.3. All actions required at each location will be carried out to the fullest
        extent.
        12.1.2.8.4. Missile trailers will be assembled in close proximity to pallets of MK-82
        general purpose bombs. Munitions storage igloos and magazines will have a pallet of
        MK-82 general purpose bombs placed inside.
        12.1.2.8.5. Non-electric trains will be used. Bomb fuse wells will be stuffed with C-
        4. If time is short, several knots will be tied in DET Cord and inserted into the C-4 or
        a blasting cap will be used if available. Time fuse will be used and a test burn of
        twelve inches will be conducted. A length sufficient to cover not less than 10 minutes
        will be used IAW T.O. 11A-1-42, General Instructions-Disposal of Ammunition.
        12.1.2.8.6. Chaff/flare/squibs/20mm will also be burned with missiles if time allows.
        If time is short, these assets will be collected into a pile on top of available
        UAL/LALS and ignited with an incendiary grenade, AN M14, NSN 1330002198557.
        12.1.2.8.7. Once direction is given to prepare for emergency destruction of
        munitions, authority to detonate will be dispatched by the 18 WG/CC or senior
        ranking on scene. The EOC will be kept informed frequently on status of
        preparations and when they are completed. Prior to detonation, all nonessential
        personnel will be evacuated to a safe distance.
     12.1.2.9. Reception and Beddown.
        12.1.2.9.1. Reception and Beddown Plan: Munitions Support Element UTCs

                                          Chapter 13

                    ABILITY TO SURVIVE AND OPERATE (ATSO)

13.1. General.
   13.1.1. Detailed ATSO procedures are contained in AFPAM 10-100.               All players will
   comply with ATSO directives in those publications.
   13.1.2. Notification of attacks will be via White Force acting as HHQ C2. All attacks
   against exercise participants will be initiated by either of two means:
      13.1.2.1. White Force will initiate ground-based attacks using ground burst simulators,
      simulated attacking forces, or with input cards.
13.2. Pre-Attack.
   13.2.1. The EOC will:
      13.2.1.1. Implement 18 WG/CC and ICC directives. These may include elements of the
      Wing Dispersal Plan or Wing Hardening Plan.
      13.2.1.2. Determine the location of contaminated waste disposal areas.
      13.2.1.3. Test C2 and Warning Systems.
      13.2.1.4. Keep unit members informed of the current MOPP level, sign/countersign,
      contaminated area locations, and CCPs.
   13.2.2. Facility Manager Actions:
      13.2.2.1. Post adequate zone maps throughout zone facilities and vehicles.
      13.2.2.2. Contaminated waste collection points will be identified by the EOC. All
      contaminated waste must be taken to one of these points. Facility owners are responsible
      for setting up a collection area IAW Facility Manager's Guide.
      13.2.2.3. Ensure all unit facilities have: hand & foot wash troughs, SABC kits,
      plastic/tarps, duct tape, litter or material to construct one, M-8 ―Bird-stands‖ for at least
      four corners of facility. GDP signs & checklist, material to black-out windows, enough
      sandbags to simulate facility hardening & to construct bunkers, UXO marking kits, and
      any unit specific requirements; refer to the Kadena Air Base Exercise Facility Setup
      Guide for complete details.
          13.2.2.3.1. The following items are recommended as a minimum for UXO marking
          kits: basic first aid supplies, CBRN Contaminated waste and UXO markers, M8 tape,
          one each ammunition can or bag for kit contents, five (5) rolls of red surveyors tape
          (NSN 9905-00-542-4504), ten (10) each ground stakes (NSN 6260-01-230-8555),
          three (3) boxes of red cylume glow sticks (NSN 6260-01-178-5559), ten (10) each
          UXO STANAG markers, Flashlight, Airman’s Manual, and radio.
      13.2.2.4. Notify units to perform post-attack assessments after chemical/biological
      contamination hazards have been isolated.
   13.2.3. Hardening:
18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                 85


      13.2.3.1. There are no hardened facilities (at Kadena or Base X).
      13.2.3.2. Protective Aircraft Shelters (PAS) are considered semi-hardened.
      13.2.3.3. If a unit expediently hardens a building, then it will be considered splinter
      protected.
      13.2.3.4. Facility users are responsible for obtaining necessary materials and
      constructing facility and equipment expedient hardening IAW the standard PACAF
      simulation and Kadena Facility Guide.
      13.2.3.5. Units are required to obtain and fill their own sandbags. See the Wing
      Hardening Plan and the Kadena Base Civil Engineer Contingency Response Plan for
      further instruction.
      13.2.3.6. Only the 18 WG/CC can declare what can or cannot be worn in a facility.
      Unless otherwise directed, semi-hardened facilities require wear of IPE gear IAW the
      current MOPP level and CSD.
   13.2.4. Contamination Preparation:
      13.2.4.1. All dispersed assets must be double wrapped with plastic sheeting, pallet bags,
      or tarps, or placed in covered storage if available IAW standard PACAF Sims.
      13.2.4.2. Facility preparation will be IAW Facility Manager's Guide.
      13.2.4.3. Decontamination fluid (5% bleach solution) will be simulated by using tap
      water.
      13.2.4.4. EOC will determine the location of contaminated waste disposal areas.
   13.2.5. Blackout. Likely threats (to Kadena and Base X) are from SOF and possible missile
   attacks. Blackout procedures are not standard in the event of these attacks.
   13.2.6. General Protective Actions:
      13.2.6.1. Ensure personnel working outdoors have quick access to overhead cover,
      vehicles, or personal covering such as plastic, tarps, raincoats, etc.
      13.2.6.2. Vehicle operators, when parking vehicles, will close all vents and windows;
      they will remain closed until vehicles are needed.
      13.2.6.3. All aircraft will be sheltered using the best available resources. If shelter
      and/or overhead cover is not available, and launching prior to the attack is not feasible,
      the aircraft will potentially be contaminated during a chemical attack, and will be treated
      as such until proven otherwise. The 10’ Rule will be implemented for these resources.
13.3. Trans-Attack.
   13.3.1. Changes in Alarm Conditions or MOPP will be transmitted by all available means
   (radio, telephone, flags, runners, local media, etc.).
   13.3.2. The ICC/EOC/Shogun Control will:
      13.3.2.1. Pass the alarm notification by all means available and assume appropriate
      MOPP level.
      13.3.2.2. Ensure inbound aircraft are notified of the attack warning and possibly divert.
 86                                                      18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012


   13.3.3. Individuals will:
      13.3.3.1. Pass the attack warning to other personnel in work area/facility.
      13.3.3.2. Take cover and assume directed MOPP level.
      13.3.3.3. If unable to get inside a facility or vehicle or under overhead cover, attempt to
      cover themselves with a poncho, tarp, or plastic sheeting to prevent contamination to suit.
      Taking cover inside a vehicle is only acceptable during missile attacks.
      13.3.3.4. If outside, observe the attack for any indications of chemical/biological agent
      use (i.e. low order detonations, liquid dispersal, chemical rain, suspected powder or
      liquid, dead or dying animals, personnel exhibiting chemical agent exposure symptoms,
      etc.).
      13.3.3.5. Remain under cover until released by EOC.
      13.3.3.6. Personnel observing ground force attack actions must warn by any means
      available those personnel within their area and report the incident to their UCC.
      13.3.3.7. Report all visual observations of release activity (i.e., missile air burst, ground
      burst, SOF backpack spray attacks, etc.) to UCC.
      13.3.3.8. Aircrew Protective Postures. Aircrew not performing flight duties will wear
      the ground crew ensemble as noted above. Aircrew will simulate MOPP levels IAW
      PACAF Sims.
13.4. Post-Attack.
   13.4.1. General. Once an attack has ended, the primary concern is to restore the base to an
   operational status. This includes identifying chemical-biological agents, battle damage,
   repairing the runway and critical facilities, treating injured personnel, expedient
   decontamination, and rendering safe unexploded ordnance.
   13.4.2. Procedures. When the attack is over, the 18 WG/CC will direct Alarm Signal and
   MOPP Level.
      13.4.2.1. ―Alarm Black, MOPP 4‖ or ―Alarm Black, MOPP 4, PAR Team Release‖. No
      movement is allowed outside of facilities and or shelters, unless specifically authorized
      by 18 WG/CC.
      13.4.2.2. ―Alarm Black, MOPP 4‖.
          13.4.2.2.1. Airfield Damage Assessment Teams (ADAT), NBC Recon Teams, EOD
          Teams and other specialized teams will be released to perform their mission.
          13.4.2.2.2. Teams will report indications of chemical agent presence found on M-8
          paper after each attack.      After reporting is complete, immediately replace
          contaminated M-8 paper. Discard old M-8 paper by triple bagging and placing in
          contaminated waste containers.
          13.4.2.2.3. Movement of individuals not on specialized teams during ―Alarm Black,
          MOPP 4‖ should not occur unless release is given by the ICC.
      13.4.2.3. ―Alarm Black, MOPP 4, PAR Team Release‖.
18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                              87


          13.4.2.3.1. Facility PAR teams are released; they will report contamination, battle
          damage and hazards to their UCCs. UCCs in turn will notify EOC.
   13.4.3. Once a battle damage profile is developed, the ICC/EOC will establish repair and
   UXO disposal priorities.
13.5. FTB Specific Procedures.
   13.5.1. FTB Contamination Control Area (CCA) Procedures.
      13.5.1.1. All contaminated personnel will process through the CCA.
      13.5.1.2. CCA Locations will be pre-identified by the EOC. CCA will be mobile for
      first chemical attack only. For all ensuing attacks CCA operations will be stationary.
      13.5.1.3. The CCA will not be available for processing until at least one hour after
      contamination is detected and determination to set up CCA is made.
      13.5.1.4. CCA Support will be as follows: CE will provide one Water Buffalo and MXG
      or MSG will supply two (2) Light Alls.
      13.5.1.5. In a real-world environment, the CCA site will not be known in advance due to
      a variety of factors. For exercise purposes only, potential CCA sites will be identified
      throughout the base.
      13.5.1.6. Aircrew Flight Equipment will be given space to process aircrew members at
      the CCA site.
      13.5.1.7. Unit commanders and supervisors will establish procedures for rotating people
      through the CCA on their shifts.
      13.5.1.8. After processing the CCA, participants may pick up water and an MRE.
   13.5.2. FTB EOD/ADAT Procedures.
      13.5.2.1. Operations. ADAT exercises will take place in specified airfield locations.
      Explosive tools will be utilized IAW AFMAN 91-201. Procedures will be performed
      with an EOD EET member on site and concurrence of the EOC Director.
      13.5.2.2. Rapid removal of sub-munitions using the ARTS will be performed at the
      SILVER FLAG site or on an inactive taxiway selected by the EET.
      13.5.2.3. C2 of ADATs will be by the EOC Director through the EOD/CE EOC
      representatives. Communication flow will be from ADAT teams through EOC to the
      MOS selection teams. If contact is lost with the EOC, the ADATs will deliver
      worksheets to the EOC and post them upon completion of predetermined routes.
      13.5.2.4. Bomb Removal Teams (BRTs). Kadena will provide BRTs to remove
      unexploded ordnance once it has been safed by EOD.
      13.5.2.5. Tracking and Recording Damage Assessment. The ADAT/DAT report form
      will be used by ADATs and the CE/EOD EOC members for tracking and recording
      damage assessment to runways and taxiways.
13.6. Base X Specific Procedures.
   13.6.1. Base X Contamination Control Area (CCA) Procedures.
88                                                    18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012


     13.6.1.1. Base X CCA/TFA operations are not intended to simulate long-term stay at the
     Toxic Free Area location. Emergency Management must develop a long-term plan.
     13.6.1.2. CCA/TFA operations for Base X are based on the following assumptions:
        13.6.1.2.1. The number of people at Base X is limited. A processing rate of 60
        people per hour will support Base X adequately. Supervisors and commanders will
        stagger shifts, ensuring this rate is maintained.
  13.6.2. Base X EOD/ADAT Procedures.
     13.6.2.1. In order to maintain 24-hour coverage and to realistically replace those forces
     which would already be in place, personnel not participating in the LORE deployment
     will act as EOD personnel already at Base X. This requires all EOD personnel have
     access to Base X.
     13.6.2.2. Bomb Removal Teams (BRTs). BRTs provide support as deployed teams and
     require access to Base X. These teams will also be required to provide vehicles and
     equipment for Base X support operations.
18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                              89


                                         Chapter 14

                                   COMMUNICATIONS

14.1. General.
   14.1.1. For the purpose of FTB scenarios, all in-garrison 18 WG agencies and partner units
   will coordinate their requirements through 18 CS using the appropriate customer service
   point for requests. Any deployed units staying on Kadena will follow the same procedures as
   in-garrison personnel by coordinating through 18 CS.
   14.1.2. The primary means of contact for communication systems problems is the
   Communications Focal Point (CFP), 634-2666. If it is an exercise related outage or issue,
   contact the 18 CS UCC.
14.2. Preparatory Guidelines.
   14.2.1. Existing phones and jacks will be used to the max extent possible.
   14.2.2. All exercise injects/real-world outages/requests for maintenance will be channeled
   through the 18 CS UCC.
   14.2.3. All communications requirements (i.e., equipment procurement, network
   connections, telephone drops) must be submitted NLT 30 days prior to STARTEX to allow
   for sufficient coordination via the Work Order Management System (WOMS).
   14.2.4. LMR nets. Users are required to use their own LMR equipment. The unit PWCS
   custodian is the primary POC for LMR issues.
   14.2.5. Secure communications. Users are responsible for their own STEs and appropriate
   keys. Other equipment requiring COMSEC material for encryption is a user responsibility.
   This includes equipment provided by the 18 CS which is turned over to users for operation
   (this ensures compatibility with other systems operated by the users).
   14.2.6. MOPP 4 Communications. All key personnel should make use of bullhorns, voice
   amplifiers, etc., to ensure that effective communication is maintained while operating in
   MOPP 4 conditions. Communications personnel are not required to provide such devices.
14.3. Message Handling Procedures.
   14.3.1. Unit-generated EXERCISE BEVERLY HIGH messages.
      14.3.1.1. If a unit has AMHS access and users have an account established through 18
      CS/SCOO, the unit can send and receive messages via the web based e-mail system on
      NIPRNet or SIPRNet as required.
      14.3.1.2. Hand-printed messages or messages typed on plain bond paper are permissible
      only in an emergency or time-critical situation (immediate precedence or above). Hand-
      printed or typed messages will not be used to circumvent normal message preparation
      procedures. When hand-written, only messages legibly printed in block letters will be
      accepted. The drafter must remain with the message(s) through transmission for data
      accuracy verification. Do not time stamp hand-written messages.
 90                                                    18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012


   14.3.2. Any outgoing EXERCISE BEVERLY HIGH messages requiring immediate
   response from the Inspection Team should be hand-carried or sent via e-mail to the XP work
   center.
14.4. Radio Frequencies.
   14.4.1. The number and type of frequencies available (simplex vs. repeater, HF/UHF/VHF,
   etc.) can be further clarified by the 18 WG Spectrum Manager.
   14.4.2. Temporary frequency requests will be processed through the base frequency manager
   via WOMS. The normal lead time is 90 days for MAJCOM and host-nation approval.
   Unless specifically authorized, no unit shall power-on or operate RF equipment.
14.5. Base X Theater Deployable Communications.
   14.6.1. For the purposes of LORE s and ORIs, it is assumed that the 18th Wing will deploy
   to a base with an existing fixed communications infrastructure.
   14.6.2. Personnel using existing phones must coordinate with 18 CS/SCO via the 18 CS CFP
   at least 30 days prior to STARTEX to ensure these numbers are annotated in the Base X
   telephone directory (which will be published on TBMCS). New communications
   requirements (e.g. previously deploying units occupying new facilities at Base X, new
   capabilities deploying, etc.) must identify new requirements to 18 CS/SCO at least 30 days
   prior to STARTEX to permit installation and testing of new circuits and instruments and
   switch programming to mirror the deployed location.
   14.6.3. All communications-related exercise scenarios will be played out using deployed and
   in-place communications personnel only.
   14.6.4. LMR nets. Users are required to use their own LMR equipment in Base X and are
   required to program their instruments using authorized frequencies for the Base X area. Base
   X is a fictional forward deployed location with different frequencies than Kadena Main Base.
   Kadena frequencies should not be used in the Base X area unless specifically approved by
   EET/XP.
   14.6.5. Re-key of LMRs at Base X will be accomplished by MOC.
   14.6.6. Secure Communications. Users are responsible for bringing their own STEs and
   appropriate fortezza cards. Other equipment requiring COMSEC material for encryption is a
   user responsibility; this includes equipment provided by the 18 CS which is turned over to
   users for operation (this ensures compatibility with other systems operated by the users).
   14.6.7. Communications services at Base X will be tailored to match deployed location as
   much as possible. All efforts will be made to simulate the real environment; in some cases
   this may result in a loss of service in several Base X areas. Certain functions, such as the
   EOC and ICC, require initial communications preparations before the exercise begins to
   provide pre-positioned capabilities. This coordination must take place at least 30 days prior
   to STARTEX to permit circuit tests, etc. All agencies installing and operating their own
   communications equipment must coordinate with deployed communicators to prevent
   unauthorized use and interference with other equipment.
   14.6.8. Equipment Installation/Support.       Any requests to change existing Kadena
   infrastructure or modify existing setups to support BASE X operations must be submitted to
18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                91


  appropriate work centers NLT 30 days prior to STARTEX. Requesting unit will fund any
  costs associated with these installations or moves.
  14.6.9. Data Processing. Personnel will bring computer components they require. Use of
  existing computers is allowed only when pre-positioned systems are available and must be
  coordinated with the owning organization.
  14.6.10. Communications Maintenance. Deployed 18 CS personnel will handle all requests
  for communications service. Requests are initially made through the cadre representative
  until a CFP function is established. The following assets are expected to be available during
  a Base X scenario, but may not be functioning immediately after 18 WG arrival:
     14.6.10.1. UHF satellite communications. Link between deployed ICC and the Theater
     Ballistic Missile Warning Network.
     14.6.10.2. VHF/UHF radio communications. Link between deployed ―Eagle Control‖
     and deployed aircraft.
     14.6.10.3. SHF satellite communications. Provides inter-site communications access.
     14.6.10.4. Official message traffic will be sent through DMS.
     14.6.10.5. Tactical switchboards. Provides intra-site telephone capability as well as
     access to DSN services as a backup to existing communication capabilities.
     14.6.10.6. Other services. Additional capabilities are limited due to asset availability or
     manpower support required. Requests are accepted through the communications focal
     point and prioritized based on workload. NOTE: Some of the above capabilities require
     a minimum of 30 to 90 days lead time to gain approval for operational use (i.e.,
     SATCOM coordination). If approval is not granted, all efforts will be made to simulate
     as many services as possible.
  14.6.11. Communications Center Support.         When tasked, a deployable network
  communications center will be set up for Base X use. Organizations requiring message
  support must adhere to the same policies/procedures available at Kadena AB. Users
  requiring message formats other than the Defense Messaging System must coordinate with
  communications personnel in advance. All efforts must be made to utilize DMS for official
  message traffic.
  14.6.12. LMR frequencies.        The following organizations/functions have permanent
  frequencies assigned under base support agreements which entitle them to LMR use at Base
  X: MOC 1, MOC 2, MOC 3, MOC 4, MOC 5, MUNS, Airfield Management Operations,
  Fire, Security Net, OSI, Intel, Eagle Net, POL, CES, EOD, Medical, Readiness, COMM,
  ALCE, ATOC, CE Alarm, and Deployed Giant Voice.
  14.6.13. Communications Personnel. As per OPLAN TPFDD, communications personnel
  are already in-place at the forward deployed. These ―in-place forces‖ personnel shall be IAW
  Table 14-1 (however, not necessarily limited to this exact composition). AFSC substitutions
  and totals deviations are permitted.
 92                                                    18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012


                                         Chapter 15

                                          SAFETY

15.1. Wing Safety Duties During Exercises. Wing safety personnel will utilize their current
office space, office equipment, and vehicles due to real world and exercise roles during
exercises. Real world response will be accomplished without exercise MOPP gear utilizing
Safety Observer Passes. Safety personnel can be reached 24/7 through the Command Post and,
when manning permits, a safety evaluator will be on-duty around the clock to monitor exercise
operations.
15.2. Personal Safety
   15.2.1. Visibility. All personnel will wear reflective belts from dusk to dawn and during
   periods of reduced visibility around the main base area as well as the flight line (SFS
   personnel exempt at the request of the SFS/CC). Additionally, all personnel will wear
   reflective belts when exposed to traffic.
   15.2.2. Hydration/Illness.
       15.2.2.1. Supervisors will ensure personnel are supplied water and that they consume the
       required amount per the water intake criteria issued by medical personnel. Supervisors
       will implement administrative controls to include breaks for fluid and food intake, and
       shift work to take advantage of cool mornings, evenings, and nights.
       15.2.2.2. Supervisors must also ensure their personnel are familiar with the
       signs/symptoms of hot/cold weather related injuries/illnesses like dehydration, heat
       stress, heat exhaustion, sun burn, frostbite, and hypothermia and implement a ―Buddy
       System‖ to help detect signs of injury/illness in others.
15.3. CWDE Wear Awareness.
   15.3.1. Visibility is greatly restricted when wearing CWDE. The M-50 mask has good
   visibility, but peripheral vision is reduced. All personnel must expect persons wearing masks
   to have limited vision and decreased dexterity. Personnel wearing masks must frequently
   turn their heads to make up for the lack of peripheral vision. Night vision is also reduced
   while wearing the masks and hearing will be affected.
   15.3.2. Operations in CWDE may result in hyperventilation, heat injuries/illnesses, or even
   claustrophobia which may result in personnel fainting or becoming ill. Furthermore, mishaps
   become more likely due to restricted visibility and general clumsiness of operating in
   CWDE. Supervisors, ―Buddies,‖ (and EET members), must be alert to detect potential
   mishap situations and provide guidance necessary to negate the mishap potential.
   15.3.3. Drivers must be trained to operate vehicles in chemical environments. Personnel will
   not operate GOVs in CWDE gear unless properly trained and certified.
   15.3.4. Medical personnel will ensure supervisors are made aware of adverse working
   conditions and the effect CWDE/PPE will have on personnel so they can implement adequate
   work-rest cycles. Tables found in AFOSHSTD 91-216 (Hot Weather, the Wind Chill
   Temperature Chart, and the Heat Index Chart) assist Medical personnel in providing
   appropriate information to wing leadership.
18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                 93


15.4. Base X Specific Procedures.
   15.4.1. The Chief of Safety is tasked to provide safety support, consultation, inspection, and
   mishap reporting, for the deployed commander in support of deployed operations.
   15.4.2. The deployed safety office will assist in briefing Right Start, Local Conditions,
   Newcomers, and Local Orientation at the request of the deployed commander.
      15.4.2.1. Deployed safety personnel will respond to exercise inputs, deployed safety
      inspections, and exercise briefings as players in exercise/MOPP gear as appropriate.
      15.4.2.2. All 18th Wing Safety personnel are authorized unrestricted access to Base X to
      monitor real-world safety concerns during the exercise. Non-deployed safety personnel
      are not required to react to Base X attacks. Safety will have three (3) unlimited vehicle
      passes in order to accomplish the mission.
      15.4.2.3. Deployed unit commanders will forward names of all safety trained personnel
      to the deployed safety office. These individuals will assist the deployed 18 WG/CC and
      individual deployed unit commanders in preventing mishaps and ensuring safe mission
      accomplishment.
   15.4.3. Any unit storing explosives at a separate Base X location will be required to possess
   an Explosives Facility License approved by 18 WG/SEW and posted at the storage location.
 94                                                     18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012


                                          Chapter 16

                                         SECURITY

16.1. FTB.
   16.1.1. Enemy Forces: Kadena represents a level I and II high-threat environment, including
   a chemical threat. Resources and personnel are subject to ground and air attacks.
   16.1.2. Friendly Forces:
   16.1.2.1. Inbound forces will not be physically available for exercise play. Additional 18
   SFS personnel may be used to simulate inbound forces. The exterior of the base is
   protected/defended by simulated defense forces of the host nation.
      16.1.2.2. On-duty security forces are available for armed response to real-world security
      situations. All exercise play will stop until real-world responses have been terminated.
      16.1.2.3. MOPP Play. MOPP gear will be on hand and worn as required, with strict
      compliance with work/rest schedules. All posted/on-duty SF personnel will be exempt
      from wearing chemical gear for real-world responses and must not wear chemical gear
      for any off-base response. Appropriate MOPP response will be assumed once processing
      of a real-world incident has been completed.
   16.1.3. The size and safety constraints of Kadena AB limit the scope of ABD/combat skills
   that can be realistically exercised (digging positions, laying communication wire, force-on-
   force training, etc.). To meet training objectives, security forces will establish a defensive
   area in an approved location for convoying and dismounted patrol training.
   16.1.4. Depending on the scenario, Security Forces may be tasked to establish a defensive
   area independent of main base to practice ABD common core tasks.
   16.1.5. 18 SFS Exercise Activities.
      16.1.5.1. The NCOIC, 18 SFS/SFMQ, will be the exercise monitor for SFS. Direct any
      questions or requests for clarification to the NCOIC.
      16.1.5.2. The 18 SFS will not up-channel or otherwise transmit off base any
      communications pertaining to the exercise.
      16.1.5.3. Host-nation forces will not be employed during LOREs. XP/EET, acting as
      HHQ, will be advised of notifications that would be made to host-nation forces.
      16.1.5.4. Handling of firearms and use-of-force procedures must be consistent with local
      requirements and USAF policy contained in AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by
      Air Force Personnel.
          16.1.5.4.1. Bayonets will not be affixed to weapons, or carried by any person.
          16.1.5.4.2. Knives, clubs, and other weapons (other than approved-issue weapons)
          are prohibited. Any approved knife will remain in its sheath during all attack
          scenarios so as not to give the impression of intent to use the weapon.
18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                95


        16.1.5.4.3. The 18 SFS Force-on-Force scenarios involving the use of weapons with
        blank ammunition will only be conducted in a separate area established for those
        scenarios (Sliver Flag Area or Area #1).
        16.1.5.4.4. Firefights will not be conducted on any of the taxiways, runways, or
        aircraft parking aprons and structures. SFS exercise fire and maneuver tactics will
        only be conducted in the SF ABD approved play areas.
        16.1.5.4.5. Physical contact between OPFOR and friendly forces is prohibited unless
        used in conjunction with enemy prisoner of war searches.
     16.1.5.5. All exercise communications (excluding radio transmissions), situation cards,
     and status reports will be preceded and followed by: ―THIS IS AN EXERCISE.‖ All
     radio transmissions will begin and end with the word ―EXERCISE‖.
     16.1.5.6. Scenarios.
        16.1.5.6.1. Effective mission execution, commensurate with sound safety practices,
        is of paramount concern. Scenario deviations, noted procedural violations, or
        potentially dangerous situations developing will be cause for immediate termination
        of any exercise scenario. The safety of all participants, observers, and evaluators will
        be maintained.
        16.1.5.6.2. No property will be intentionally destroyed, with the exception of minor
        OPFOR activity (e.g. cutting field phone wire, fences, concertina, or other obstacles).
        16.1.5.6.3. Evaluators and OPFOR may use actual or simulated weapons; however,
        they will use blank ammunition and adapters.
        16.1.5.6.4. On-scene command/EET are responsible for control of exercise scenarios.
        16.1.5.6.5. When a perpetrator is involved in an exercise inject, all posts and patrols
        must be advised. Responding patrols must acknowledge their understanding that a
        perpetrator is an expected element of the exercise.
        16.1.5.6.6. Pistols will remain holstered throughout the exercise. On-duty personnel
        armed with the M-16/M-4 will have the magazine inserted but no rounds of
        ammunition will be chambered. Weapons are not to be pointed at individuals at any
        time.
        16.1.5.6.7. When responding to a simulated situation wherein SFS personnel could
        reasonably expect to immediately encounter an armed adversary (a perpetrator is part
        of exercise), they should do so with weapons ready; that is, at Port Arms (chamber
        empty, on safe, finger not in trigger guard). On-duty forces will not unload their
        assigned weapons for exercises.
     16.1.5.7. Military Working Dogs (MWD).
        16.1.5.7.1. During all exercises, the on-scene commander must be aware of the
        strengths and weaknesses of utilizing MWD teams. If, for instance, the large number
        of personnel present easily agitates a MWD, the use of a muzzle may be appropriate.
        Supervisors must also know how to respond to MWD teams should assistance be
        required.
 96                                                      18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012


          16.1.5.7.2. All military working dogs will remain on a leash and controlled by their
          handlers at all times when out of their kennel.
          16.1.5.7.3. When conducting a search during an exercise, all personnel must
          understand that perpetrator(s) are an expected element of the exercise and must
          ensure that the perpetrator is protected should the MWD be released.
          16.1.5.7.4. Before conducting searches of buildings, personnel, etc., appropriate
          warnings must be given. All exercise participants prior to the exercise should
          understand loose-dog procedures.
16.2. Base X. This section only addresses only aspects of 18 SFS Base X exercise play that
differ from FTB play.
   16.2.1. Access.
      16.2.1.1. Personnel who do not have an AF Form 1199, but require unescorted access
      during local OREs should be issued Contingency/Exercise Area AF Form 1199 Badges
      through their unit security managers IAW 18WGI 31-101, para. 6.2. Upon initial arrival
      and when reporting for subsequent shifts, all deployed personnel gain access to Base X
      through approved EEPs. Personnel without a Restricted Access Badge must be escorted
      while in restricted areas.
      16.2.1.2. Personnel deployed to Base X who do not strictly adhere to the boundaries of
      Base X will be dealt with as real-world security violations.
      16.2.1.3. Personnel who do not meet ICC/EOC unescorted entry requirements will be
      escorted by an authorized escort official.
   16.2.2. Upon initiation of an exercise involving Base X, Security Forces will be tasked to
   deploy personnel to Base X, IAW tasked OPLANs/CONPLANs.
   16.2.3. Depending on the scenario, Security Forces may be tasked to deploy to other areas
   independent of Base X to practice ABD common core tasks.
   16.2.4. The 18 SFS will be responsible for supply of deployed security forces. Only
   equipment and facilities expected to be at the Base X will be utilized. WRM vehicle assets
   and Kadena Security Forces vehicles may be used as simulated in-place supplied vehicles.
   16.2.5. The size, location, and safety constraints of Base X limit the scope of ABD skills that
   can be exercised. To meet training objectives security forces will establish a defensive area
   in the Silver Flag Area or utilize Area 1 for convoying and dismounted patrol training.
   16.2.6. Personnel will not deploy with live ammunition. The only personnel authorized to
   enter Base X with live ammunition are aircrew members required to be armed in-flight for
   real world requirements and Security Forces personnel for real-world requirements.
   16.2.7. Real-world forces will maintain the capability to respond to incidents within 5
   minutes. Personnel required to transit the Base X area with live ammunition must be

17.1. FTB.
17.1.1. Facility Access.
       17.1.1.1. The 18 CEG personnel are authorized access to CE facilities to withdraw
       equipment for exercises as necessary.
       17.1.1.2. If 18 CEG is selectively armed, the primary CE armory will be at Bldg. 1461,
       and the alternate CE Armory is located at Bldg. 939.
   17.1.2. C2.
       17.1.2.1. Direct line telephones and the CE radio net will be utilized as the primary CE
       communication links.
          17.1.2.1.1. The 18 CEG will use this equipment to facilitate C2 and control between
          team chiefs, Damage Control Center (DCC) and the EOC. EOC/DCC traffic will be
          confined to secure telephone when necessary to protect critical information.
       17.1.2.2. EOC/Alt EOC: The EOC/Alt EOC will include CE personnel to assess airfield
       damage, select Minimum Airfield Operating Strips (MAOS), and manage all CE
       operations. CEX will man the CBRN Cell. FD and EOD will staff the EOC with one
       member each to operate their area of control.
       17.1.2.3. DCC/Primary/Alternate/Tertiary DCC: The DCC will be manned to direct all
       CE operations such as ADR and facility/utility damage assessment and repair. A CE net
       radio, STE, SIPRNet and Fax will be installed at the DCC. The alternate DCC will have
       a CE net radio.
   17.1.3. Firefighters. Refer to 18 CES/CEF SOP 32-100 for wartime roles.
       17.1.3.1. All fire stations and personnel will be considered Kadena exercise facilities and
       will participate in all scenarios under the direction of the Senior Fire Officer (SFO).
       17.1.3.2. At STARTEX, military firefighters will be placed on two 12-hour shifts and
       will provide around-the-clock fire protection services from their dispersal locations.
       Shifts will rotate at intervals determined by the SFO.
          17.1.3.2.1. Civilian firefighters will remain on a standard 24-hour work schedule.
          They will be placed on vehicles that limit their responses to exercise scenarios after
          2200 hrs.
          17.1.3.2.2. Real-world emergencies and stand-by will take precedence over any
          exercise scenario. The SFO will determine continuance of fire and emergency
          service play.
          17.1.3.2.3. Firefighters will primarily use the Crash Net for communications, with
          the Fire Net as backup. Either net is subject to be used at any time depending upon
          availability.
98                                                    18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012


         17.1.3.2.4. Personnel and equipment will respond to exercises from their dispersed
         locations as directed by the SFO, under the guidance of the EOC director through the
         SFO in the EOC.
         17.1.3.2.5. Attrition. Firefighters will not be attrited for any reason, due to real-
         world obligations and response requirements. However, EET/XP may document any
         incidents that would normally result in attrition.
         17.1.3.2.6. Fire department air bottles and foam reserves will be dispersed with
         vehicles at various locations.
  17.1.4. Damage Assessment.
     17.1.4.1. Airfield Damage Assessment Teams (ADATs) require the use of taxiways to
     realistically test surveying, identifying, recording, and reporting UXO and airfield
     damage information to the EOC for the purpose of MAOS selection and aircraft recovery.
     17.1.4.2. Damage Assessment and Repair Teams (DARTs) will survey, identify, record,
     and report damage on critical facilities and utility systems to the DCC.
  17.1.5. MAOS Plotting and Selection: Plotting of airfield damage will be performed at the
  EOC. MOS selection will be performed at the EOC. Airfield damage information used to
  determine the MAOS will be reported by the ADATs. Damage and repair priorities will be
  provided to the DCC for action.
     17.1.5.1. MAOS stripping teams will use water instead of paint to stripe MAOS. Using
     actual paint for stripping and then removing is not cost efficient.
  17.1.6. Airfield Damage Repair (ADR) Task Evaluations. All ADR requirements will be
  accomplished at the Silver Flag site. ADR includes Mobile Aircraft Arresting System
  (MAAS), Emergency Airfield Lighting Systems (EALS), and marking the MAOS to include
  paint stripping. The MOPP level at Silver Flag (simulated runway) area should be the same
  as the simulated damage area of the actual runway.
     17.1.6.1. Crater/Spall Repair: Actual crater/spall repair will be accomplished at the
     Silver Flag site.
     17.1.6.2. FOD Covers: FOD cover installation will be accomplished at the Silver Flag
     site.
  17.1.7. Other Requirements.
     17.1.7.1. Facility Hardening. CE will demonstrate capability to expediently harden one
     facility with available assets. See the Wing Hardening Plan and the Kadena Base Civil
     Engineer Contingency Response Plan for further instruction.
  17.1.8. Utility Outage Plans. The following procedures will be used in the event of outages.
     17.1.8.1. Electrical system outage.
         17.1.8.1.1. Generators will be either pre-positioned or permanently installed to
         provide back-up power to all critical facilities. The DCC maintains the generator
         priority list.
18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                    99


           17.1.8.1.2. Building/generator custodians are responsible for generator operation
           (start-up, refueling, etc.).   Building/generator custodians should perform an
           operational check/test immediately on deployment and report status to the DCC.
           Building custodians should contact the DCC for training on generator operation or
           maintenance.
       17.1.8.2. Potable water trailers (if required) and Port-a-Johns will be positioned
       throughout the base. Building latrines should not be used unless a water source is
       available. Contact the DCC for servicing of Port-a-Johns, water trailers, or for trash
       collection. One CE person will be utilized as an escort for the contractor to service Port-
       a-Johns and collect trash. The escort will be exempt from participation in attack
       responses.
   17.1.9. Base Recovery. It is assumed that at least 1 EA, 2 EB and 2 EP teams are deployed,
   and that contractors will supplement deployed CE forces. Contractor capability will be
   limited to four airfield craters within 24 hours and permanent repairs or replacement of
   damaged facilities under normal contracting timeframes.
   17.1.10. Hazardous Waste Accumulation Points. The approved accumulation point is
   identified/marked in the base map and is located in the DCC.
17.2. Base X. This section only addresses areas that differ from the FTB scenario.
   17.2.1. Mobility processing and the number of Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force
   (BEEF) teams deploying will be IAW the OPLAN being exercised. Mobility equipment and
   personnel will be moved into Base X after the take-off and simulated flight time of their
   respective simulated airlift mission.
   17.2.2. Weapons/Ammo. Prime BEEF pallets will be loaded with real-world weapons (M-
   16/M-9) and ammunition.           The unit will actually process and safeguard live
   ammunition/munitions during generation and mobility. After cargo marshalling is complete
   and the equipment is released at the POD, live munitions will be returned to storage and the
   training munitions may be deployed and employed. Only sufficient amounts of live
   ammunition to safeguard unit weapons will be deployed. Upon arrival at Base X, field
   armories will be established inside and outside of Base X to provide security for the
   weapons. The pallets will remain in Base X for use by the deploying teams.
   17.2.3. C2. Direct line telephones and the CE radio net will be utilized as primary
   communication links. The 18 CEG will use this equipment to facilitate communications for
   C2 between Base X team chiefs, DCC, and the EOC. EOC/DCC traffic will be confined to
   secure telephone when necessary to protect critical information.
   17.2.4. Phase I.
       17.2.4.1. Fire Department personnel will deploy as part of their respective Prime BEEF
       teams. Upon completion of processing into Base X, fire department personnel will be
       released back to the Kadena fire department.
       17.2.4.2. Fire Station #2, Bldg. 3300, will remain a Kadena facility until the official start
       time of Phase II or when sufficient numbers of firefighters have processed into Base X.
       This action allows for an organized transition of deployed firefighters into the facility.
100                                                       18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012


      Furthermore, this action will allow Kadena military and civilian firefighters to relocate to
      other fire stations without disruption of real-world fire service from Fire Station #2.
  17.2.5. Phase II.
      17.2.5.1. At initiation of Phase II, military firefighters will be placed on 12-hour shifts.
      17.2.5.2. Civilian firefighters will remain on a standard 24-hour work schedule.
      17.2.5.3. Military personnel assigned to Fire Headquarters, Fire Station #2 and Fire
      Station #3 will support Base X operations, if manning permits. Bldg. 739, the alternate
      Fire Dispatch Center, will be the responsibility of Base X personnel. Home Station
      firefighters will be responsible for stand-bys and exercises that are not involved in Base
      X.
      17.2.5.4. Real-world emergencies will take precedence over any exercise either in or out
      of Base X. The SFO will determine continuance of fire and emergency service play.
      17.2.5.5. Base X firefighters will primarily use the Fire Net, and Kadena AB firefighters
      will primarily use the Crash Net for communications. Either net is subject to being used
      by Base X or Kadena depending upon availability.
      17.2.5.6. Vehicles used as Base X assets will mirror COB vehicle assets to the extent
      possible. However, vehicle manning and usage will not fall below the minimum required
      to maintain adequate fire protection coverage for actual emergency responses.
      17.2.5.7. At Base X, personnel, support equipment and vehicles will normally be
      dispersed upon notification of Alarm Condition Yellow. Personnel and equipment will
      respond to exercises from their dispersed positions as directed by the SFO.
  17.2.6. Damage Assessment. To accommodate flying operations and safety concerns,
  ADATs will us a 1,000-ft section of Taxiway L as the simulated Base X runway.
  17.2.7. MAOS Plotting and Selection. Plotting of airfield damage will be performed at the
  Base X SCR and DCC. MOS selection will be performed at the Base X EOC. Airfield
  damage information used to determine the MAOS will be reported by the ADATs.
  17.2.8. Facility Hardening.     CE will demonstrate capability to expediently harden one
  facility.
  17.2.9. Utility Outage Plans. The main electrical power and water supply to Base X is
  distributed from local sources through Kadena AB distribution systems. The following
  procedures will be used in the event of outages.
      17.2.9.1. Electrical system outage. Generators will be pre-positioned within Base X to
      provide back-up power to critical facilities. The DCC maintains the generator priority
      list.
      17.2.9.2. Potable water trailers (if required) and Port-a-Johns will be positioned
      throughout Base X. Building latrines should not be used unless a water source is
      available. Contact the DCC for servicing of Port-a-Johns, water trailers, or for trash
      collection. One CE Base X person will be utilized as an escort for the contractor to
      service Port-a-Johns and collect trash. The escort will be exempt from attacks.
18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                              101


  17.2.10. Base X Recovery. It is assumed that at least 1 EA, 1 EB and 1 EP teams are
  deployed, and that contractors will supplement deployed CE forces. Contractor capability
  will be limited to four airfield craters within 24 hours and permanent repairs or replacement
  of damaged facilities under normal contracting time frames.
  17.2.11. Hazardous Waste Accumulation Points. Base X has no approved facilities for
  hazardous waste accumulation. To decrease potential for hazardous waste spills, Civil
  Engineer personnel may temporarily leave Base X and use the 18 CES Generator
  Maintenance Section approved accumulation point.            They must contact Generator
  Maintenance Shop personnel to assist in disposal; they must immediately re-enter Base X.

                                          Chapter 18

                              WEAPONS AND AMMUNITION

18.1. General. This chapter describes the responsibilities for issuing, storing, safeguarding, and
turning in weapons and ammunition during LOREs/ORIs. Each organization is responsible for
knowing, understanding, and complying with these procedures. Furthermore, each unit is
responsible for having sufficient quantities of weapons and ammunition readily available for
each member.
18.2. Responsibilities. The 18th Wing weapons are owned and maintained in serviceable
condition by individual organizations. Generally officers are assigned a 9mm pistol and two 15
round clips of ammunition, while enlisted members will be assigned an M-16 and two 30 round
clips. The amount of ammunition authorized for individual organizations may vary; check AFC
21-209. Except when other provisions are made, all weapons are stored in Base Supply.
18.3. FTB.
   18.3.1. Each unit will have a weapons account custodian and courier to receipt for the
   weapons associated with their assigned position.
   18.3.2. Ammunition. Personnel issued weapons will not be issued live ammunition unless
   they are providing courier service for deployed mobility weapons. The only other personnel
   authorized to carry live ammunition are aircrew members required to be armed in-flight for
   real-world requirements, real-world on-duty Security Forces, and personnel performing real-
   world resource protection (e.g. 33 RQS guarding helicopter guns). Persons carrying weapons
   with live ammunition will not have their weapons, magazines or holsters marked in any way.
   18.3.3. Real-world forces will maintain the capability to respond to security incidents within
   5 minutes. If an emergency situation occurs, STOP-EX will be initiated. Exercise
   participants will depart the affected area and rally for accountability at a designated point as
   soon as real-world forces have control of the situation.
   18.3.4. Marking Weapons. Persons carrying exercise weapons will have their weapons
   clearly marked, whether unloaded or loaded with blank ammunition. M-60/M-249/M-16/M-
   4 will be marked with bright white tape around the butt of the weapon. M-9 pistols will be
   marked with bright white tape affixed to the holster exterior. Persons armed with the M-9
   pistol during LOREs/ORIs will not remove the weapon from its holster to engage in exercise
   intruder play. Weapons (M-60/M-249/M-16/M-4) with blank ammunition must have a red or
   yellow blank adapter affixed to the flash suppresser, which may not be covered or
   camouflaged. For blank adapters with rings in the tightening mechanism, tape may be used
   to ensure noise discipline is maintained; however, this tape may not cover or conceal the red
   adapter. For personnel engaged in tactical portions of exercises where blank ammunition is
   authorized, white tape will be affixed to the exposed portion of the magazine once inserted.
   For all personnel other than those in tactical exercises where blank ammunition is used,
   magazines will not be inserted into weapons.
   18.3.5. If Security Forces deploy to areas outside of Kadena AB to practice ABD common
   core tasks, blank ammunition may be used to provide a realistic training experience. Strict
18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                            103


  issue, control and accountability procedures will be established prior to the use of blank
  ammunition to avoid live and blank ammunition being mixed.
  18.3.6. Arming Points.     Kadena AB will employ multiple arming points to maximize
  dispersal/issue actions.
     18.3.6.1. Maintenance Group arming point is Bldg. 46105
     18.3.6.2. Mission Support Group arming point is Bldg. 3382.
     18.3.6.3. Civil Engineer Group arming point is Bldg. 939.
     18.3.6.4. Operations Group arming points are individual squadron AFE areas.
  18.3.7. Weapon Storage Responsibilities. Each Group is responsible for the following
  actions. Units is not associated with a Group may place weapons in the Security Forces or
  the 18 LRS armory.
     18.3.7.1. Weapon Storage personnel must be well versed in all storage/arming
     procedures. Weapons Storage personnel will be unarmed, or their weapons will not
     contain live ammunition, when issuing simulated weapons or weapon crates. Personnel
     will be armed if live weapons are involved, whether the issuance is simulated or not.
     18.3.7.2. Groups will provide, in writing, Weapons Vault Authorization Letters to 18
     LRS, Security Forces, and Munitions listing couriers who are authorized to receipt for
     weapons and ammunition. The same personnel may be authorized to receive weapons
     and ammunition.
     18.3.7.3. Group Weapon Storage personnel will prepare and man arming points.
     18.3.7.4. Individual groups will provide transportation and couriers to receive weapons
     and ammunition.

     weapons and ammunition.
     18.3.7.6. Group Weapon Storage personnel will issue weapons and ammunition to
     individuals/units within each Group when directed by CSD. They will adhere to all
     procedures in DOD 5100.76-M, AFI 31-207, AFI 31-101, AFI 31-229, and AFI 36-2225.
     18.3.7.7. Failure to comply will result in 18 LRS not being able to issue weapons or
     authorize their release IAW AFM 23-110 and applicable resource protection directives.
  18.3.8. Supply Responsibilities. Supply personnel are responsible for receiving and storing
  weapons until a dispersal order is received via CSD. Exceptions include Security Forces,
  Civil Engineers, cadre, pilots, general officers, and others who have made special
  arrangements to maintain their own weapons.
  18.3.9. Armory Personnel Responsibilities.
     18.3.9.1. Armory personnel must be well versed in all armory/arming procedures.
     Armory personnel will be unarmed, or weapon will not contain live ammunition when
     issuing simulated weapons. Personnel will be armed if live weapons are involved,
     whether or not the issuance is simulated.

      18.3.9.2. Armory personnel will notify Security Forces of all weapon movements prior
      to and upon completion of those movements. They will provide weapons type, quantity,
      building location, and final destination of weapon movements. Group weapons
      custodians must maintain positive control and have the means for sounding an alarm (i.e.,
      radio, cell phone, etc.) when guarding or transporting weapons.
  18.3.10. Dispersal of Weapons.
      18.3.10.1. Dispersal of weapons will be directed via CSD. Once the dispersal order is
      received, each affected unit will immediately dispatch authorized weapons custodians
      and couriers to Supply to obtain unit weapons.
      18.3.10.2. When transporting 16 or more weapons, weapons must be moved under the
      protection of armed guard surveillance (two drivers, one of whom is armed). Armed
      couriers will escort weapon shipments until their return to the 18 LRS Weapons Vault.
      Weapons are issued and controlled via serial number through a series of hand receipts
      and signature tally records.
      18.3.10.3. Each individual Group is responsible for positive control, storage,
      safekeeping, and issue of weapons through their own arming point. Constant surveillance
      is required for all weapons, unless an approved alarmed facility is available. Group
      deployed weapons custodians are responsible for knowing and understanding all
      armory/arming procedures.
  18.3.11. Arming.
      18.3.11.1. Arming/selective arming will be directed via CSD.
      18.3.11.2. All weapons will be returned to the arming point at the end of a shift, unless
      otherwise directed by the 18 WG/CC.
  18.3.12. Weapons Turn-In. At ENDEX, all weapons received from 18 LRS must
  immediately be returned. Group weapons couriers are required to assist with inventories.
  18.3.13. The 18 SFS will write detailed armory/arming procedures and provide technical
  assistance to units establishing arming facilities. Furthermore, they will develop a working
  relationship with Base Supply armory personnel and other arming points to ensure firearm
  safety among all armory personnel.
  18.3.14. 18th Munitions Squadron (18 MUNS) Responsibilities.
      18.3.14.1. The 18 MUNS will provide annual munitions forecasting instructions to all
      18th Wing organizations and consolidate wing munitions forecast.
      18.3.14.2. The 18th Wing units in support of the 44th and 67th Fighter Squadrons will
      have 60 rounds of 5.56mm per primary mobility enlisted personnel assigned or 30 rounds
      of 9mm per primary mobility officer personnel assigned, provided by 18 MUNS. These
      rounds will be stored until the order to arm is received. They will be bulk issued to
      designated Group representatives.
      18.3.14.2.1. 1 Units with requirements other than the standard aviation package of 60
      rounds of 5.56mm or 30 rounds of 9mm must make independent arrangements. In either
      case, the unit requiring the munitions is responsible for ensuring their requirements are
      properly forecast and shipped from 18 MUNS.
18WGI90-201 28 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                               105


       18.3.14.3. At ENDEX, all units that received ammunition from 18 MUNS must
       immediately return the ammunition for shipment back to long term storage.
18.4. Base X. Unless otherwise specified, all provisions of the FTB section apply during a Base
X scenario with the following additional guidelines.
   18.4.1. Due to security considerations and space limitations, shipment of mobility weapons
   maintained by 18 LRS to Base X will be simulated unless otherwise directed. The 18 LRS is
   the lead unit for shipment of mobility weapons and 18 MUNS is the lead unit for shipment of
   ammunition. Each organization, however, must follow the guidelines in the 18th Wing IDP
   to ensure their weapons and ammunition are properly deployed/redeployed in a timely
   manner.
   18.4.2. All deployable weapons will be palletized and marshaled at K5-Right for shipment.
   Aircrews, Security Forces, and Civil Engineers may also simulate weapons movement to
   Base X. All pallets of weapons will be immediately returned to Base Supply Armory once
   released by K5-Right. Ammunition will also be marshaled to K5-Right, however once
   cleared, the ammunition will be returned to its bunker within MUNS (which is considered a
   Base X play area).
   18.4.2.1. Each unit will have a weapons account custodian and courier deploy to Base X to
   receipt for the weapons associated with their assigned mobility position.
   18.4.3. Personnel deployed to Base X will not deploy with live ammunition unless they are
   providing courier service for deployed mobility weapons. The only personnel authorized to
   enter the Base X area with live ammunition are aircrew members required to be armed in
   flight for real-world requirements and real-world on-duty security forces.
   18.4.4. No force-on-force training or OPFOR scenarios using blank ammunition will take
   place in Base X due to security and weapon safety requirements, limitations on using blank
   ammunition on or near taxiways and runways, and to avoid mixing live ammo and blank
   ammo. Persons carrying exercise weapons, unloaded or loaded with blank ammunition, will
   have their weapons clearly marked IAW with the FTB section of this chapter.
   18.4.5. Weapon storage personnel will ensure the weapons account custodian reports to the
   18 LRS Equipment Management Element to have a deployment indicator placed on weapons
   to be shipped. They will notify Base Supply Weapon Storage personnel when completed.
   18.4.6. All units deploying from Kadena with munitions will advise 18 MUNS Munitions
   Operations of the exact munitions they are deploying with prior to departure. Upon arrival at

MEMORANDUM FOR 18 WG/XP

FROM: 18 MDG/CC

SUBJECT: Simulation of Copying DD Form 2766s (Adult Prevention and Chronic Care
Flowsheets)

1. Request the following simulation be approved:

PHOTOCOPYING DD FORM 2766S (ADULT PREVENTION AND CHRONIC CARE
FLOWSHEETS)

OPR/OCR: 18 MDSS/SGAR / Capt Townsend-Atkins / 630-4947

REASON: Unnecessary expenditure of resources with disproportionately small return on
investment.

EVENT TO BE SIMULATED: Copying of DD Form 2766s.

SPECIFIC COST AND/OR IMPACT IF NOT APPROVED: The Patient Administration Team
spends 4-6 hours after each exercise shredding hundreds of photocopied DD Form 2766s
resulting in wasted time and resources.

DEMONSTRATE: Per AFI 41-210, Patient Administration Functions, during real-world
deployments/contingencies, personnel retrieve the original DD Form 2766 from the
18th Medical Group and take it to their deployed location for any documented medical care they
may receive. While deployed, a photocopied DD Form 2766 is kept in the member’s medical
record. Upon return from the member’s deployment, the original DD Form 2766 is placed back
into the medical record and the copied DD Form 2766 is shredded.

During exercises, the Patient Admin Team will pull all original DD Form 2766s and demonstrate
the capability by photocopying 50 DD Form 2766s and placing the photocopies in the member’s
medical charts. All personnel will carry the original DD Form 2766s to the mobility line for
processing, thereby following the guidelines of AFI 41-210.
