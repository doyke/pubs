This pamphlet series is intended as a load planning guide and provides the basic information,
data, and technical specifications needed in order for planners (both long range and individual
movement) to load plan aircraft in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF). Equipment and methods
listed are compatible with all CRAF aircraft and cargo areas discussed. It must be noted that,
unlike military cargo aircraft, civilian airframes are not standardized, and can vary widely,
even within each carrier’s fleet. Final approval, therefore, ultimately rests with the
individual contractor providing airlift services to the DOD. This pamphlet series enables
application of DTR 4500.9-R, Defense Transportation Regulation – Part III Mobility, Appendix
V, Aircraft Load Planning and Documentation; as well as AMCI 10-402, Civil Reserve Air Fleet
(CRAF). The guidance contained herein is applicable to all USAF, AFRC, ANG and DOD
agencies whenever they are charged with using the CRAF assets contained herein, in accordance
with DOD, inter-service, and/or MAJCOM agreements.

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Purpose. This pamphlet series is non-directive in nature. It provides the basic information,
data, and technical specifications needed in order for planners to more efficiently and effectively
load plan aircraft in the CRAF.

1.2. Scope. CRAF aircraft specifications listed herein are current as of the date of this printing.
Equipment and methods listed are compatible with all CRAF aircraft and cargo areas discussed.
It must be noted that, unlike military cargo aircraft, civilian airframes are not
standardized, and can vary widely, even within each carrier’s fleet. Final approval,
therefore, ultimately rests with the individual contractor providing airlift services to the
DOD.
1.2.1. Volume 3, Boeing. AMCPAM 24-2 Volume 3 deals specifically with aircraft
manufactured by the Boeing Company. Boeing was first formed in 1916 as Pacific               Aero
Products Co, changing its name about a year later to the Boeing Airplane Co. Through several
mergers over the years (the last being with McDonnell Douglas Corp in 1997), the Boeing
Company has melded the companies founded by aerospace pioneers William Boeing, Donald
Douglas, James McDonnell, James "Dutch" Kindelberger, and Howard Hughes Jr. As of the date
of this publication, the Boeing Company has produced almost 17,000 commercial jet aircraft
alone, with over 12,100 still in service.

1.3. Arrangement. This pamphlet series is designed for easy reference and access to the most
commonly needed information for planning purposes. Essentially, Volume 1 will contain all
information common to the entire CRAF program and most, if not all, carriers. Volumes 2
through 5 will contain information specific to a particular manufacturer’s airframes, with each
sub-volume addendum addressing a different series or type. Each can be referenced separately
from another; however, each addendum needs to be used in conjunction with Volume 1.
1.3.1. Volume 3, Boeing Addenda. Volume 3 is not separated from each subsequent addendum,
but is published as a “cover” document along with and as an introduction for each addendum.
The same information for Volume 3 essentially gets republished--unchanged with each Boeing
model’s addendum.
1.3.2. Volume 3, Boeing Quick Reference Tables. All chapter descriptions for various models
are designed to be used in conjunction with Chapter 2 Quick Reference Tables. The information
in the Quick Reference Tables will generally not be restated in the expanded chapters as they are
meant primarily for pictorial figures.

1.4. Supplements. Changes or supplements to this pamphlet by agencies, other than AMC, are
prohibited. This does not preclude its use as a reference document for preparation of intra-
agency instructional directives.

1.5. Acronyms. An explanation of the acronyms used in this pamphlet is in AMCPAM 24-2,
Volume 1, Attachment 1.

1.7. Description. Addendum F. Boeing B777 Series.
The B777 Series aircraft are wide-body, twin engine aircraft, designed for medium to long range.
The B777 resulted in many commercial aircraft "firsts" for Boeing: first time that airliners (eight
of them) partnered in design/development; first entirely computer designed; first "fly-by-wire".
Three design factors led to increased capacity/range. First, the B777 incorporates extensive use
of lighter weight materials (newer alloys and composites), accounting for 9-12% of the aircraft's
structural weight. This, along with using "fly-by-wire" (over cable controls) realized significant
weight savings. Second, the use of more efficient, quieter turbofans afforded greater performance
with only two engines. The final innovation was a wider, more circular fuselage (approximately
4 ft. wider than the B767 and only about 2 ft. less than the B747), giving it greater capacity for
its size. The B777 holds several distance records, and enjoys a 99.2% dispatch reliability rate.
Currently, over 820 B777's have been manufactured and delivered, and almost 300 are on order.

The baseline, B777-200, started development in 1990, and first flew on June 1994. The FAA (for
the first time) granted the B777-200 approval to fly extended-range twin-engine operations
(ETOPS) concurrent with its type-certification in April of 1995. So far, there are 88 B777-200's.

The B777-200ER, or extended range, initially flew October 1996, and was type-certified January
1997. The B777-200ER, or IGW/HGW (Increased/High Gross Weight), incorporated higher-
thrust engines, increased fuel/gross weight capacities, but otherwise remained the same as the
B777-200. The B777-200ER, currently the most popular of the series, has 412 models built.

The B777-300 was the next derivation. It flew its maiden voyage in October 1997, and was type-
certified on May 1998. The B777-300 was "stretched" roughly 33 ft. to accommodate more
passengers, and kept many of the same innovations from the B777-200ER, although having less
range. Sixty B777-300 models have been delivered to date.

Looking for increased range, the B777-300ER was developed. It flew first on February 2003 and
was type-certified on March 2004. It led the way for all future models by incorporating higher
performance engines, raked wingtips and more fuel/gross weight capacity. With over 210 models
delivered and almost 200 on order, the B777-300ER may soon outstrip the -200ER in volume.

The B777-200LR, or longer range, model had its first flight March 2005, and it received type-
certification February 2006. It has more fuel capacity (even without 3 optional aft compartment
AMCPAM24-2V3_ADD-F                     3 NOVEMBER 2011                                        7


fuel tanks) than any previous B777 model, and a higher gross weight than all but the B777-
300ER. Also known as the Worldliner, it holds the world record for distance traveled nonstop by
a commercial jetliner (11,664 NM). Currently only 37 B777-200LR's have been made.

A freighter version, the B777F, is the latest entry into the series, having its first flight in July
2008 and only recently being type-certified in February 2009. Although 7 of the 11 currently
delivered are for overseas carriers, the B777F has orders for 60 more, with half being domestic.

                               QUICK REFERENCE TABLES

2.1. Ranges. Most numbers are shown as a range, due to representing all-passenger to all-freight
versions OR due to different modifications within a series/type. Also, within a series, several
different engines/weight classes may exist.

2.2. Pallets. Unless otherwise noted, pallet information is based on the civilian pallet IATA code
PAG- / P1P- type LD7 which measures 88" × 125".

2.3. Table Legends.
2.3.1. Compartments. Unless otherwise noted, compartments are: M=Main/Upper;
F=Forward/Lower Lobe; A=Aft/Lower Lobe; B=Bulk/Lower Lobe.

2.3.2. “X”. An “X” represents the information does NOT apply for that series/type (ex: an all-
passenger version would have an “X” by Main Compartment Door)

2.3.3. Question Mark “?”. A “?” represents that the information should apply, but no
information exists in the manufacturer’s technical manuals.

2.3.4. Exclamation Point “!”. An “!” represents information that should apply, but has been
derived from a reliable, but non-manufacturer source.

2.4. After-Market Conversions. As a reminder, individual airlines may have converted an

                                            1) Shows inside dimensions where cargo compartment has a constant cross-section (internal contour measured perpendicular to the
                                               aircraft length - excludes any tapered section of the fuselage).
                                            2) Minimum 2 inches of clearance must exist between aircraft contour and maximum payload contour (represented by inner solid line of
                                               the contour drawing).
                                            3) All horizontal dimensions are measured left or right of aircraft centerline (CL).
                                            4) All vertical dimensions are measured from the top of the conveyor plane.
