1. General Guidance.
     1.1. Program purpose. The purpose of the AFSPC W&T program is to maximize the
     mission effectiveness of AFSPC space and cyberspace forces through mission planning,
     critical self-analysis, and the implementation of tactics. Ultimately, the W&T program yields
     tacticians who think about their tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) in a structured way,
     are committed to continuous learning about their weapon systems and the threat, and sharpen
     their peers and themselves through critical self-analysis.
        1.1.1. Mission Planning. Mission planning is an analytical process used to develop a
        deliberate methodology for the effective employment of weapon systems. Tacticians use
        this process to ensure mission accomplishment and threat/risk mitigation. Mission
        planning takes into consideration:
             1.1.1.1. The Mission: Know the assigned mission, objectives, and how it impacts the
             overall tactical situation.
             1.1.1.2. The Enemy: Know the enemy including how it fights, what it knows, how it
             operates and its level of commitment.
             1.1.1.3. The Threat: Understand battlespace elements that could prevent mission
             accomplishment.
             1.1.1.4. The Weapon System: Not only how it operates, but the employment
             considerations associated with its capabilities, advantages and limitations.
        1.1.2. Critical Self-Analysis. Critical self-analysis is a process by which (1) mission
        accomplishment is evaluated taking into consideration planning and execution
        performance, (2) deficiencies are identified, and (3) lessons learned are developed to
        improve future performance. Deficiencies can be identified through use of the debrief
        process, an effective debriefing process plays a central role in the rigorous and ongoing
        critical analysis of all unit operational processes. Self-analysis provides an unparalleled
        opportunity for crewmembers to critically review, understand, and learn from their
AFSPCI10-415 14 JUNE 2013                                                                            3


        performance in a given situation. Therefore, self-analysis should play a crucial role in the
        debrief process. AFI 90-1601, Air Force Lessons Learned Program provides the
        guidance to duly develop a complete lessons learned program. Critical self-analysis
        applies at the individual level as well as the organizational level.
        1.1.3. Implementation of Tactics. The AFSPC tactics cycle, shown in Figure 1, includes
        a development phase and an implementation phase. The cycle describes an iterative
        process in which new tactics are developed and existing tactics are implemented and
        reviewed to ensure relevancy and effectiveness. AFSPCI 10-260, Tactics Development
        Program, provides guidance for the tactics development phase of the tactics cycle. This
        AFSPCI primarily addresses the implementation phase.
             1.1.3.1. Space Electronic Warfare Integrated Reprogramming (Space EWIR) actions
             may be required to determine specific mission data that enables optimized weapon
             system employment. Reference AFI 10-703, Electronic Warfare Integrated
             Reprogramming and/or contact the 25th Space Range Squadron for further
             information.

                               DEBRIEF FUNDAMENTALS

A3.1. Debriefing is simply reconstructing and evaluating an event to determine how to replicate
success and avoid repeat mistakes. A successful debrief depends on the ability to critically
analyze events and the willingness to admit mistakes. The debrief process should encompass a
review of events, identification of problems, determination of root causes and development of
lessons learned. AFI 90-1601, Air Force Lessons Learned Program provides an excellent
reference for the debriefing process and how to execute a lessons learned program.
   A3.1.1. Review of events: In this step, debrief participants are collecting observations which
   may point to problems encountered during the event. Participants should use all sources to
   assist them in faithfully recreating the event. Useful tools available to aid in reconstruction
   include screen captures, event logs, chat logs and archived disk data. Each individual must
   recognize how his or her actions fit into the overall reconstruction of the event and should be
   prepared to explain the event from their perspective. One technique that may aid in
   reconstruction is to develop a timeline with the events as they occurred chronologically.
   Special emphasis is then placed on potential problem areas.
   A3.1.2. Identification of problems (also known as Debrief Focus Points [DFP]): The
   observations collected during the reconstruction phase are the means by which participants
   will identify problems. Problems as defined here are, “Areas or aspects of the event which
   impeded achievement of the desired outcome.” For example, if the mission was to support a
   special operations team through the application of a given tactic and the tactic was not
   accomplished, that would be a problem. DFPs focus on overall mission accomplishment not
   individual actions. However, individual actions may be contributing factors (CF) leading to
   a root cause (RC). To facilitate the debrief process, the DFP should be stated as a question.
   Therefore, using the example above the DFP becomes, “Why did the special operations team
   not receive the support it needed?” There may be many contributing factors to the mistake.
   Participants should record these factors and tie them to the identified problem to aid in the
   next step of the debrief process, determining the RC.
   A3.1.3. Determination of RC: Determining the RC is as easy as determining why the
   problem occurred. The difficult part lies in digging down to the actual problem and
   disregarding issues that were not a factor in the actual problem. Here, the contributing
   factors identified in the previous step will aid in diagnosing the RC. Honesty and the
   willingness to accept fault are keys to performing this step successfully.
       A3.1.3.1. RC determination may be accomplished via the “why” technique. Using the
       example above, the DFP is:
          A3.1.3.1.1. DFP: “Why did the special operations team not receive the support it
          needed?”
          A3.1.3.1.2. CF: I did not execute the required tactic at the required time.
          A3.1.3.1.3. “Why did I not execute the required tactic at the required time?”
          A3.1.3.1.4. CF: I didn’t prioritize my shift actions and other required tasks correctly.
16                                                              AFSPCI10-415 14 JUNE 2013


         A3.1.3.1.5. “Why didn’t I properly prioritize my shift actions to ensure I executed the
         required tactic at the required time?”
         A3.1.3.1.6. CF: I was unclear as to the priority of accomplishing the specified tactic
         with regard to my other assigned tasks.
         A3.1.3.1.7. “Why was I was unclear as to the priority of accomplishing the specified
         tactic with regard to my other assigned tasks?”
         A3.1.3.1.8. CF: Because it was not specifically addressed in the mission planning
         brief.
         A3.1.3.1.9. “Why was the prioritization of the specified tactic not specifically
         addressed during the mission planning brief?”
         A3.1.3.1.10. RC: Because there was no written guidance which identified the need to
         prioritize mission specific tactics with regard to other assigned tasks.
     A3.1.3.2. At a certain point further inquiry will not result in actionable solutions. That is
     the RC of the problem. In the example above, the RC of the problem is that mission
     planning guidance did not adequately address the need to prioritize actions in order to
     ensure that lower priority actions did not interfere with mission essential priorities.
  A3.1.4. Development of lessons learned. A lesson learned is a statement addressing the RC
  that prevents the problem from happening again. Good lessons learned are measurable and
  repeatable fix actions that lead to better job performance. A lesson learned must address four
  main points: when to enact the lesson, what specific actions to accomplish, how to
  accomplish those actions and why to comply with the lesson learned. A lesson learned
  should strike a balance between applicability and specificity. In other words, it must
  encompass the problem without being so broad as to apply in every circumstance and so
  narrow that the event has little chance of repeating.
     A3.1.4.1. The following formula has been very helpful as a template to start writing
     lessons learned: “When (circumstance: mission planning or executing), Opposite of RC,
     by Instructional Fix (proposed mechanism), so that DFP doesn’t happen.” Once
     comfortable writing lessons learned, using the formula word for word may no longer be
     necessary.
     A3.1.4.2. In the example above the root cause of the DFP was a lack of guidance which
     identified the need to prioritize mission specific tactics with regard to other assigned
     tasks. Therefore, a good lesson learned for the identified root cause is:
         A3.1.4.2.1. “During mission planning, I will prioritize mission tactics and tasks in
         accordance with a mission planning briefing template, so that warfighters depending
         on me get the support they need.”
         A3.1.4.2.2. This lesson learned identifies when the action will be executed, what
         specific action to take, how that action will be accomplished and why to comply with
         the lesson. It is actionable, measurable, and repeatable and will prevent the problem
         from recurring.
  A3.1.5. Process Improvement: As in the example above, lessons learned derived from events
  may drive checklist updates or procedural changes. Therefore, lessons learned that generate
AFSPCI10-415 14 JUNE 2013                                                                   17


  action items should find their way into a group or wing Operational Review Panel or other
  board designed to track fix actions. Evaluate lessons learned for Tactic Improvement
  Proposals (TIP). A TIP is simply a suggestion for either a new way to use an existing
  capability or another way to perform an established task. Anyone may submit a TIP;
  reference AFSPCI 10-260 for additional information on TIPs.
  A3.1.6. Debriefing is a developed skill that requires practice. Mission efficiency will
  increase as the debriefing process yields operators who continually dissect their performance
  to determine the best way to do the job and implement their fix actions.
