                                            Chapter 1

           USAF INTERNATIONAL MILITARY STANDARDIZATION (IMS)

1.1. Purpose. This chapter describes the core goals of IMS, the primary offices of responsibility
for USAF IMS activities, and outlines the various levels of IMS activities and basic DoD and
USAF IMS policies.
   1.1.1. Goals of IMS. IMS is the process by which the Department of Defense achieves the
   closest practicable cooperation among the Services and Department of Defense agencies for
   the most efficient use of research, development, and production resources, and agrees to
   adopt on the broadest possible basis the use of: a. common or compatible operational,
   administrative, and logistic procedures; b. common or compatible technical procedures and
   criteria; c. common, compatible, or interchangeable supplies, components, weapons, or
   equipment; and, d. common or compatible tactical doctrine with corresponding
   organizational compatibility. Standardization among contributing forces can greatly increase
   operational and support capabilities. The USAF advances interoperability by promoting
   standardization between allies and possible coalition partners. To provide the combatant
   commanders a more capable fighting force requires the active participation of national air
   force elements in progressing international military standardization. The objective of the
   USAF IMS program is to enable the air forces of the United States, its allies and other
   friendly coalition nations to operate together in the most effective manner. This objective can
   be achieved through the closest practical cooperation among these military forces, the
   efficient use of resources, and the reduction of operational, logistical, technical, and
   procedural obstacles.
   1.1.2. Tools of IMS. International Standardization Agreements (ISAs) form the basis that
   allows the military forces of friendly nations to operate effectively together. NATO
   Standardization Agreements (STANAGs) provide one example of a mature process to
   achieve international standardization. NATO, the Air and Space Interoperability Council
   (ASIC), and the American, British, Canadian, Australian and New Zealand Armies’ (ABCA)
   Program are three of many fora where international standardization activities are formally
   progressed. There are many other examples, and new standardization activities should reduce
   needless duplication of effort by utilizing existing standardization agreements as templates
   for their efforts.
1.2. The Lead Agent (LA). CJCSI 2700.01 requires the Joint Staff/J-7 to appoint a Department
of Defense (DoD) organization to act as the LA for United States (US) participation in
international military Rationalization, Standardization, and Interoperability (RSI) bodies. The
LA has primary interest in the equipment, doctrine or procedure being standardized, and
oversees the selection of principal representatives and participation of all US activity in the IMS
process. The Joint Staff, in CJCSI 2700.01, designated USAF as the LA for many IMS bodies.
CJCSI 2700.01 also identifies AF/A5XX-ISO as the Office of Record for all USAF Lead Agent
ISAs.
   1.2.1. USAF IMS Responsibilities. The Defense Standardization Program (DSP) assigns
   responsibility for the Air Force standardization program through the Office of the Secretary
   of the Air Force. As established through the authority of the Office of the Secretary of the Air
 6                                                            AFI60-106 30 SEPTEMBER 2014


     Force in AFPD 60-1, the Departmental Standardization Office (DepSO) is responsible for all
     Air Force materiel standardization matters, for those portions of the DSP assigned to the Air
     Force, and for allocated Lead Agent Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) responsibilities
     relating to US implementing documents for materiel ISAs (see AFI 60-101). The DepSO is
     located within SAF/AQRE.
     1.2.2. Authority for USAF International Military Standardization Activities. IAW AFPD
     60-1, the AF/A5X is responsible for the International Military Standardization (IMS)
     Program and for establishing the Air Force International Standardization Office to manage
     the program, The ISO is located with AF/A5XX.
1.3. IMS Management within USAF. The Air Force International Standardization Office
(ISO) develops policy and manages Air Force participation in IMS activities including NATO
MCASB, ASIC, ABCA Armies and AUSCANNZUKUS Navies. The ISO administers US
participation in those standardization activities identified in CJCSI 2700.01 for which the USAF
is LA. To ensure consistent USAF policy and procedures for NATO standardization, the ISO
also develops policy and administers the processing of standardization agreements developed
within the NATO Air Force Armaments Group (NAFAG) under CNAD, the NATO Fuels and
Lubricants Working Group (NFLWG) and Petroleum Handling Equipment Working Group
(PHEWG) under NATO Petroleum Committee (NPC), and the NATO Air Traffic Management
Committee (ATMC) with associated working groups and panels. To provide a centralized
coordination function and reduce duplication of effort, the ISO will also assist as requested the
coordination of Air Force IMS activities undertaken by the unified and specified combatant
commands, MAJCOMs, numbered Air Forces, direct reporting units (DRUs) or field operating
agencies (FOAs).
     1.3.1. USAF International Standardization Office. AF/A5XX-ISO is a part of the Air Force
     Regional Plans & Issues Division (AF/A5XX) and reports to the Director of Operational
     Planning, Policy and Strategy (AF/A5X). The office contact information is:

     1.3.2. Other USAF Offices. Due to their mutual and complementary responsibilities for
     international standardization activities, the ISO generally coordinates policy and IMS actions
     with SAF/AQI for CNAD/NAFAG issues, Air Force Petroleum Agency (AFPA) for
     NFLWG issues, AF Civil Engineering Center (AFCEC) for PHEWG issues, AF/A3O for
     ATMC issues, and the DepSO (SAF/AQRE) for DoD and multi-service materiel
     standardization issues.
1.4. Fundamental Levels. Four levels of standardization are defined to allow policy makers to
make practical decisions and the most efficient use of resources concerning IMS. The levels (as
defined in Joint Publication (JP) 1-02, JP 3-0, JP 6-0, and NATO publication AAP-6) are listed
below:
AFI60-106 30 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                     7


   1.4.1. Interoperability -- 1. The ability to operate in synergy in the execution of assigned
   tasks. 2. The condition achieved among communications-electronics systems or items of
   communications-electronics equipment when information or services can be exchanged
   directly and satisfactorily between them and/or their users. The degree of interoperability
   should be defined when referring to specific cases. 3. The ability to act together coherently,
   effectively and efficiently to achieve Allied tactical, operational and strategic objectives.
   1.4.2. Compatibility -- The suitability of products, processes or services for use together
   under specific conditions to fulfill relevant requirements without causing unacceptable
   interactions.
   1.4.3. Interchangeability -- The ability of one product, process or service to be used in place
   of another to fulfill the same requirements.
   1.4.4. Commonality -- A quality which applies to materiel or systems: 1. Possessing like and
   interchangeable characteristics enabling each to be utilized, or operated and maintained, by
   personnel trained on the others without additional specialized training. 2. Having
   interchangeable repair parts and/or components. 3. Applying to consumable items
   interchangeably equivalent without adjustment. 4. NATO defines commonality as a state
   achieved when groups of individuals, organizations or nations use common doctrine,
   procedures, or equipment.
1.5. Practical Limits to IMS. The USAF seeks the highest possible and practical level of
standardization with its allies in all areas of IMS. IMS decisions must be flexible and practical.
To attempt the highest level of IMS (commonality) when a lower level (compatibility or
interchangeability) appears practical or desirable may result in no agreement, or an unprofitable
one. At the same time, policy must allow smaller groups of allied nations the flexibility to
achieve standardization that may not be obtainable by all nations.
1.6. Basic USAF Policies. The following policies comply with DoD and CJCS policy guidance
on international military standardization:
   1.6.1. Cooperation. USAF cooperates, to the greatest extent possible, with its allies and the
   other Services regarding standardization issues.
   1.6.2. Standardization Goals. Standardization is not an end in itself, but is a means to
   increase operational effectiveness among allied military forces to economize resources and
   enhance military capabilities.
   1.6.3. Standardization Scope. Standardization is voluntary at the national decision- making
   level. Nations should make every effort, however, to maximize the use of limited resources
   and to standardize equipment and/or procedures which are essential to combined operations.
   1.6.4. US Process. The US directs IMS efforts toward producing the most effective
   execution of combined operational plans. Efforts should achieve the highest level of
   standardization possible with allied military forces. MAJCOMs, numbered air forces and
   other agencies frequently deal with other foreign counterparts on a bilateral or multilateral
   basis.
       1.6.4.1. Foreign Agreements. Agreements specifying IMS elements (such as doctrine,
       procedures or materiel agreements) are often included as part of operation plans
       (OPLANS) or Memoranda of Understanding (MOU). To maximize economy of effort,
8                                                           AFI60-106 30 SEPTEMBER 2014


       AF/A5XX-ISO can supply templates based on formal ISAs with NATO or other formal
       IMS organizations to reduce the duplication of effort by those staffs.
       1.6.4.2. Standardization of Equipment with NATO Nations. US policy dictates that
       standardization of equipment with NATO nations is considered when procuring
       equipment for use by US Armed Forces personnel stationed in Europe or likely to deploy
       to Europe or in support of NATO operations.
    1.6.5. Impact of USAF Subscription to ISA. When USAF subscribes to US-ratified ISAs, it
    imposes an obligation on the entire USAF to adhere to the terms of the agreement. The
    USAF accomplishes this by implementing the agreement.
    1.6.6. Deviating from US Ratified ISAs.
       1.6.6.1. For operational ISAs: Organizations with a requirement that would preclude
       adherence to a ratified ISA must request specific deviation authorization from AF/A5XX-
       ISO on a case-by-case basis.
       1.6.6.2. For materiel ISAs: Organizations that do not comply with an applicable ratified
       materiel ISA must notify AF/A5XX-ISO and SAF/AQRE on a case-by-case basis.
    1.6.7. Technology Transfer. AF/A5XX-ISO supports the release of technology to countries
    with which the United States has major security interests when such transfers can strengthen
    collective security. These transfers must be in accordance with US laws, regulations, and
    policies.
    1.6.8. Constraints to Standardization Activities. Standardization is not appropriate when it
    would significantly hinder or retard research, materiel development, strategy, tactics and/or
    operational techniques.
    1.6.9. Programs Excluded from IMS. USAF policy, as a rule, excludes the following areas
    from IMS programs:
       1.6.9.1. Classified Data. The US will exchange information classified RESTRICTED
       DATA or FORMERLY RESTRICTED DATA in accordance with the Atomic Energy
       Act of 1954. (Do not confuse the term RESTRICTED DATA with the allied countries’
       use of the term RESTRICTED to denote a level of classification.)
       1.6.9.2. Intelligence Systems. Intelligence and counter-intelligence systems, except
       when a nation offers to loan or share equipment or information.
       1.6.9.3. Electronic Countermeasures. Information on the vulnerability of specific
       weapon systems to electronic countermeasures or electronic counter-countermeasures.
       1.6.9.4. Electronic Warfare. Re-programmable digital electronic warfare systems, when
       those systems depend upon self-contained intelligence data bases.
       1.6.9.5. Other Factors. Items other than the above that may assume a highly critical
       nature with respect to the defense or overall security of the United States, especially the
       release of information prohibited by AFPD 16-2, Disclosure of Military Information to
       Foreign Governments and International Organizations, or other US laws, policies and
       instructions.
AFI60-106 30 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                     9


  1.6.10. Information Disclosure. National disclosure policies and DoD and USAF guidance
  on disclosure matters govern exchange of information in the pursuit of standardization.
  Patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and proprietary data belonging to the United States, foreign
  governments, private companies or private individuals must be protected in the exchange of
  information and equipment according to US law and applicable international agreements.
  1.6.11. Equipment Exchange. The Air Force is committed to a vigorous program of
  experimenting, testing, exercising and evaluating new operational concepts and systems for
  air and space power. USAF participants will make maximum use possible of Equipment
  Loans for test and evaluation (such as the ASIC Test Project Agreement Program) authorized
  by this AFI, the US Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2796d) and other agreements.
  USAF participants will also make maximum use of the Foreign Comparative Testing
  program (10 U.S.C. 2350a) which authorizes evaluation of foreign military equipment for
  potential procurement and employment by USAF forces.

                                           Chapter 2

       INTERNATIONAL MILITARY STANDARDIZATION ORGANIZATIONS

2.1. Purpose. This chapter provides an introduction to the NATO Military Committee Air
Standardization Board, NATO Conference of National Armament Directors (CNAD), Air and
Space Interoperability Council (ASIC), American, British, Canadian, Australian (ABCA) Armies
and other International Military Standardization (IMS) bodies. There are international civilian
governmental, civilian commercial (industry), and military organizations working to standardize
a wide array of products, equipment, doctrine and procedures. IMS delegates and organizations
must liaise with related standardization bodies to avoid duplication of effort. This chapter
describes the three formal IMS organizations with which the Air Force most frequently interacts.
It does not list all the IMS and international standardization (IS) organizations and their
exclusion from this chapter should not be construed as an indication of lack of importance to Air
Force IMS activities.
2.2. NATO Standardization Overview. In 1949, twelve nations chartered NATO. NATO
identified a need for standardizing alliance nations’ doctrine, tactics and equipment and
established its first standardization body – the Military Agency for Standardization (MAS). In
2001, the MAS merged with the Office of NATO Standardization to form the NATO
Standardization Agency (NSA). (On 1 July 2014, NSA was reorganized and designated the
NATO Standardization Office (NSO)). Within the NSO, there is the Military Committee Air
Standardization Board (MCASB) that manages Working Groups dealing with Air Standards.
Since then, several other NATO International Staff bodies such as the Conference of National
Armaments Directors (CNAD) have included standards development as part of their
responsibilities. The NATO Standardization Organization was established in 1995 to develop a
NATO Standardization Program (NSP). The NSA Handbook provides a good overview of the
NSA organizational structure.           NATO formulates standardization activities through
development and implementation of NATO Standardization Agreements (STANAGs),
Standardization Recommendations (STANREC), and Allied Publications (APs). STANAGs,
STANRECs, and APs are produced under the overall authority of the Military Committee, the
CNAD, and other Council Committees. The NATO publication, AAP-3, Production,
Maintenance and Management of NATO Standardization Documents, provides common
procedures for development and maintenance of these documents.
2.3. NATO Military Committee (MC) Board Structure. Within NATO, both the civilian and
military structures develop standardization agreements. The Military Committee, comprised of
military representatives of each member nation, is responsible for military standardization
policy. The MC is the principal agency concerned with standardization. The MC fosters NATO
military standardization within the policy established by the Military Committee and the NATO
Standardization Organization, enabling NATO forces to operate together in the most effective
manner. NATO MC, created in 1951, has a well-established system for developing ISAs and
addressing standardization issues among the member nations.
   2.3.1. MC Service Boards. To progress NATO military standardization efficiently, the MC
   is organized into Single Service Boards (SSB) (Air, Army, Maritime, and Medical) and a
   Joint Service Board (JSB), each consisting of a permanent chairman, an administrative staff
   (secretariat) and one Service member appointed by and representing each participating
AFI60-106 30 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                  11


  NATO nation. Currently, the USAF Regional Plans and Issues Division (AF/A5XX)
  provides the USAF Representative to the NATO MCASB. Each Service Board manages
  standardization activities within their scope of interests. All Boards pursue standardization
  activities through working groups (WGs). The WGs formulate standardization agreements
  (STANAGs) and Allied Publications (APs). The MC promulgates all approved STANAGs
  and APs, including those sponsored by non-MCASB NATO groups (military and civilian).
  2.3.2. MC Service Board Process. The Air, Army, and Naval Boards are in permanent
  session and meet formally quarterly at NATO Headquarters (HQ NATO), Brussels, Belgium.
  Service Board members contribute expertise, provide direction to WGs, and present national
  positions or comments on proposals the MC is processing. Each Board member is primarily
  responsible to represent their nation on Service board matters. They work directly for their
  own nation, not NATO MC or the Service Boards.
  2.3.3. MC Working Groups (WGs). The Service boards establish WGs as the focal points
  for IMS activities within their assigned functional area. Working Parties review current and
  proposed STANAGs and APs, and consider new areas for standardization. A WG consists of
  a chairman, a secretary, a Service Board representative and delegations from member nations
  and, sometimes, the NATO Commands. Nations generally nominate officers in the grade of
  O-6 to O-4, or civilian equivalent, to serve as a WG chairman. The WG chairman has
  significant international responsibilities in addition to any responsibilities they may
  concurrently have with the national delegation. Therefore, if a US delegation offers to chair
  a WG meeting, an O-6 officer or civilian equivalent is the preferred nominee. Depending on
  the specific WG, an O-5 officer or civilian equivalent may be acceptable, but must be
  coordinated with AF/A5XX-ISO. Although the chairman is a functional area expert, the
  chairman is not necessarily a previous member of the WG (i.e. a specialist who has not
  previously served on the WG but has the requisite skills and professional background may be
  nominated by a nation to serve as chairman for the specific meeting). The chairman runs the
  meeting and is responsible for ensuring the WG completes the agenda in the meeting time
  allotted. The board chairman welcomes the delegates and officially opens the meeting. The
  secretary provides administrative oversight and corporate memory, since they normally hold
  their position for 3-4 years. A Service Board representative greets the delegates on behalf of
  the board, provides the board guidance to the WG, and gives authoritative advice on policies,
  procedures and specific board guidance. The Head of Delegation (HoD) leads the nation’s
  delegation which may consist of one or more people depending on the WG. (There is no
  formal rule on how large a delegation can or should be. The HoD makes the determination.)
  NATO expects delegates will be subject-matter experts and qualified and authorized to
  represent their nations.
     2.3.3.1. WG Meeting Cycle. WGs normally meet every 6-12 months subject to Service
     Board approval. A WG’s Terms of Reference (TOR) governs the tasks and scope of each
     WG’s standardization efforts. The WG reviews the TOR at each WG meeting and
     amends it if necessary. The responsible Service Board has final approval of the TOR.
     The responsible board approves and issues a WG Convening Order (CO) several months
     prior to the WG meeting. The CO contains the meeting agenda, dates, times and place of
     the meeting and designates who the chairman will be. HoDs receive a copy of the CO.
     A delegation pre-meeting may be necessary to formulate joint US positions on all agenda
 12                                                           AFI60-106 30 SEPTEMBER 2014


       items. It is the responsibility of the HoD (even if delegated to others) to coordinate the
       delegation pre-meeting and the national comments on agenda items.
       2.3.3.2. WG Pre-Meeting Considerations. During the pre-meeting, members of the US
       delegation should determine if someone will serve on the drafting committee. The WG
       may discuss certain topics in panels or committees for one or two days. Again, during the
       pre-meeting, the HoD should let the delegates know who will represent the US in these
       special sessions. Normally, WGs try to achieve consensus thus increasing the number of
       nations able to ratify and implement a particular document. When a national delegation
       accepts responsibility for an action item, the HoD is responsible to ensure the item is
       completed by the agreed suspense. The HoD should not accept an action item just
       because no other delegation will do it.
       2.3.3.3. NATO Languages. English and French are the official languages for WG
       meetings and the MCASB provides simultaneous translation. If the US delegation is
       going to make a presentation at the meeting, the HoD should submit a copy of the
       speaker’s text, if available, to the WG secretary for use by the translators. At the start of
       the meeting, delegates will form a drafting committee to write the meeting report. The
       meeting report is the formal record of accomplishments and taskings of the WG.
       2.3.3.4. Post-Meeting Report. After the meeting, the Secretary will issue the meeting
       report and an action item suspense list following Service Board approval.
   2.3.4. Head of Delegation (HoD). A HoD leads each nation's delegation at a NATO
   MCASB WG, NFLWG, and PHEWG. The HoD is the NATO MCASB recognized
   spokesperson for his or her nation in all WG meetings and activities. The HoD supervises
   and coordinates all phases of the nation’s WG efforts. For NATO MCASB WGs, NFLWG,
   and PHEWG led by USAF personnel, the AF/A5X is the appointing authority for US HoDs.
   AF/A5X’s authority to appoint HoDs is based on AF/A5X’s position as the official
   international operational standardization representative of the SECAF and AF/A5X’s
   responsibility to implement the USAF IMS program IAW AFPD 60-1. USAF organizations
   nominate personnel to serve as a HoD through the HoD’s supervisor to AF/A5XX-ISO. For
   reasons of international protocol and the sensitivity of some international subjects, USAF
   appointed HoDs will generally be either an O-5/6 officer or civilian equivalent. On an
   exceptional basis, an O-4 or civilian equivalent may be appointed as HoD. A formal
   appointment letter will be prepared documenting the HoD’s appointment as head of the US
   national delegation. A HoD generally serves as the head of the delegation for as long as they
   remain associated with a WG, unless a new HoD is appointed by AF/A5X. For any NATO
   MCASB WGs headed by another US component, that component will coordinate with
   AF/A5XX-ISO for the nomination and appointment of the HoD. The component will also
   coordinate with AF/A5XX-ISO for the preparation of appointment letters to be signed by
   both the AF/A5X and the appropriate tasking authority of the other component. For NAFAG
   and ATMC HoD appointments they will be appointed by SAF/AQI and AF/A3O-B
   respectively.
2.4. NATO International Staff International Standardization Activities. The CNAD, Senior
NATO Logisticians Conference (SNLC), NATO Command, Control, Communications (NC3)
Board, and NATO Petroleum Committee (NPC) are some of the other activities that report
directly to the North Atlantic Council (NAC), and can undertake the development or revision of
AFI60-106 30 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                    13


STANAGs. The Main Armament Groups under the CNAD involved with standardization
include: NATO Naval Armaments Group (NNAG or AC/141), NATO Air Force Armaments
Group (NAFAG or AC/224), and NATO Army Armaments Group (NAAG or AC/225). In
addition, there are Cadre Groups under CNAD: Group of National Directors for Quality
Assurance (AC/250), Group of Experts on the Safety Aspects of Transportation and Storage of
Military Ammunition and Explosives (AC/258), Group on Standardization of Materiel and
Engineering Practices (AC/301), and the Group on Safety and Suitability for Service of
Munitions and Explosives (AC/310).
   2.4.1. The primary CNAD-subordinate group in which the USAF participates is the
   NAFAG. The U.S. NAFAG Principal is appointed by SAF/AQ. The NAFAG mission is to
   enhance the effectiveness of NATO air forces by promoting cooperation, standardization,
   and interoperability in the area of aerospace armaments through joint activities, information
   exchange, and materiel standardization agreements. The USAF participates in other CNAD
   groups as well as panels under the NSO to support the goals of IMS programs or as tasked by
   OSD.
       2.4.1.1. The NAFAG has a subordinate group structure to support its activities. The
       USAF provides the majority of U.S. representation in these groups.
       2.4.1.2. The other MAGs have a subordinate group structure to support their activities.
       Each MAG has a JCG administratively assigned to it. All of the capability groups are
       subject to joint participation according to their programs of work. As applicable, the
       USAF provides participation in these groups.
       2.4.1.3. Procedural Guidance. USAF personnel attending meetings of the NAFAG and
       its subordinate groups will use AFMAN 16-114, U.S. Air Force Participation in
       International Armaments Cooperation (IAC) Programs, to guide their participation:
2.5. Other NATO Organizations Involved in Standardization. The CNAD Tri-Service
Group on Communications and Electronics (AC/302) has been disbanded and merged into the
NATO C3 Board which will continue C3 standardization activities. The Research and
Technology Organization (RTO) created through the merger of the CNAD Defense Research
Group (AC/243) and the Military Committee’s Advisory Group for Aerospace Research and
Development (AGARD) may have limited involvement in IMS in the future.
2.6. Air and Space Interoperability Council (ASIC) Overview. ASIC is a five-nation
(Australia [AU], Canada [CA], New Zealand [NZ], United Kingdom [UK], and United States
[US]) organization with responsibility for identifying and eliminating the material and technical
obstacles to the fullest cooperation among the member nation’s air forces and to obtain the
greatest possible economy in the use of combined resources and efforts. ASIC, formed in 1948
and originally called the Air Standardization Coordination Committee (ASCC) until 2005
predates NATO. The ASIC mission is: to enhance current and future coalition war fighting
capabilities through air and space power interoperability. Unlike NATO, a mutual defense
treaty does not back ASIC and the ASIC has no designated geographic area of responsibility.
ASIC formulates ISAs with worldwide applicability in mind. The ASIC equivalent to a NATO
STANAGs is an Air Standard (AIR STD). All published AIR STDs, other than those which
must be withheld for security reasons, are sent to the NATO MCASB. Many are subsequently
adopted as NATO STANAGs. Similarly, some ASIC AIR STDs are derived from STANAGs
that are considered suitable for adoption by the ASIC air forces. A close liaison naturally exists
 14                                                         AFI60-106 30 SEPTEMBER 2014


between ASIC and NATO MCASB since three of the five ASIC nations (US, UK & CA) are
NATO members and many of the ASIC WG delegates from these countries are also NATO
MCASB WG delegates. This close liaison reduces duplication of effort and leads to economy of
resources. ASIC includes both international and national elements:
   2.6.1. National management levels of ASIC. The management levels include the National
   Directors, National Program Managers (NPM), Management Committee (MC), Heads of
   Delegation (HoD), and Working Groups (WG) or Steering Group (Figure 2.1). The WGs are
   Agile Combat Support (ACS), Air Mobility (AM), Aerospace Medical Group (ASMG),
   Command/Control & Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2&ISR), Force
   Application (FA), Force Protection (FP), and Fuels Group (FG).
       2.6.1.1. National Directors (NDs). Each member nation appoints a General Officer,
       typically at the one or two-star level to represent their Chief of Staff as the ND. The NDs
       meet annually to formulate policy, direct the activities of the ASIC organization, issue
       directives to the WGs, and resolve standardization problems. The US’s ASIC National
       Director is AF/A5X. The ASIC US National Director is appointed by the USAF Chief of
       Staff as the USAF official standardization representative and AF/A5X is recognized by
       the USAF DepSO through AFPD 60-1 as the USAF military standardization official.
       AF/A5X is the National Director for all the air forces of the US -- USAF and USN.
       AF/A5X will coordinate with sister Services for standards that will affect aviation.

Figure 2.1. Management Level Organizations.




       2.6.1.2. Management Committee (MC). The MC serves as the executive secretariat of
       the organization. The MC provides day-to-day management of ASIC activities. It sits in
       permanent session at HQ USAF and shares office facilities with AF/A5XX- ISO. The
       MC membership includes national air force representatives (usually a lieutenant colonel
       or equivalent grade officer) from each member nation. Each member will serve as the
       Chair for at least one WG, each member has the authority to manage and coordinate that
       WG’s actions and progress, both during and between meetings. Each member is also
       assigned a secretarial function for another WG. For complete listing of MC
       responsibilities, refer to Air STD C2ISR 1074, ASIC Instructions.
AFI60-106 30 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                              15


      2.6.1.3. Working Groups (WGs). The MC provides a Chairman and Secretary to the
      WGs. ASIC member nations send a delegation, composed of the HoD, Subject Matter
      Experts (SMEs), and representatives of other Services and defense agencies, to WG
      meetings (Figure 2.2). ASIC sponsors WGs covering aspects of air operations
      procedures, doctrine, materiel, and support facilities. These WGs are the ASIC focal
      points for developing standardization agreements called Air Standards (AIR STD),
      Advisory Publications (ADV PUB), Information Publications (INFO PUB) and
      exchanges of equipment under the Test Project Agreement (TPA) Program.

Figure 2.2. Working Group Level.




   2.6.2. National Elements of ASIC. In addition to the ASIC ND, the national elements
   include the NPM, HoDs, SMEs, Project Leads (PL), and representatives of other Services or
   agencies (Figure 2.3).
 16                                                       AFI60-106 30 SEPTEMBER 2014


Figure 2.3. National Organization.




      2.6.2.1. National Program Manager (NPM). Each participating national Air Force
      appoints an NPM responsible directly to his or her respective ASIC national director for
      the ASIC program on a national basis. The US Department of the Navy (DoN) appoints
      a program manager (PM) to interact on the DoN’s behalf. The NPMs meet at least
      annually with the ASIC MC to resolve questions of standardization policy and review the
      progress of ASIC. The USAF ASIC member is the Chief, International Standardization
      Office (AF/A5XX-ISO).
      2.6.2.2. Heads of Delegation (HoD). A HoD is a senior officer or civilian appointed to
      supervise one or more WGs and related WG activities at the national level. The HoD is
      the sole national spokesperson for their nation and leads the national delegation at WG
      meetings. AF/A5X is the appointing authority for all HoDs for USAF IMS activities.
      AF/A5X’s authority to appoint HoDs is based on AF/A5X’s position as the official
      standardization representative of the USAF Chief of Staff (as ASIC US National
      Director) and AF/A5X’s responsibility to implement the USAF IMS program delegated
      by the AF DepSO in AFPD 60-1 and AFI 60-101. Organizations nominate personnel to
      serve as a HoD through the HoD’s supervisor to AF/A5XX-ISO. For reasons of
      international protocol and the sensitivity of some international subjects, USAF appointed
      HoDs will generally be either an O-5/6 officer or civilian equivalent. On an exceptional
      basis, an O-4 or civilian equivalent may be appointed as HoD. A formal appointment
      letter will be prepared documenting the HoD’s appointment as head of the US national
      delegation. A HoD generally serves as the head of the delegation for as long as they
      remain associated with a WG, unless a new HoD is appointed by the US National
      Director. For any ASIC WGs headed by another US component, that component will
      coordinate with AF/A5XX-ISO for the nomination and appointment of the HoD. The
      component will also coordinate with AF/A5XX-ISO for the preparation of appointment
      letters.
AFI60-106 30 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                  17


2.7. ASIC Working Group. A WG consists of a Chairman (Ch), Secretary, and national
delegations. WGs normally meet every 12-18 months with meetings lasting five duty days. The
location rotates among the five nations. The WG Ch, a member of the Management Committee,
provides administrative oversight during the meeting, monitors WG progress between the
meetings and makes recommendations to the National Directors on the future direction of the
WG. The NDs approve the ND Task List for each WG which provides specific guidance, tasks
and WG scope. The HoD may hold a pre-meeting with the US delegation to develop a joint
national position on each agenda item prior to the actual meeting or may develop national
positions secretarially. Two documents explain the ASIC structure and administrative
procedures, and are invaluable for any HoD, NPM, or ASIC WG delegate. The Management
Committee (MC) issues ASIC Instructions (Air STD C2ISR 1074) covering administrative
details, WG meeting guidelines, development of ASIC IMS documents and sample formats for
all ASIC documentation. The ASIC National Directors’ Meeting Report produced annually by
the ASIC MC, contains the National Directors’ yearly direction for ASIC as a whole, specific
directives for each ASIC WG and details of each WG’s members, projects and ISAs.
2.8. Standardization Organizations similar to ASIC. Part of the MC’s or delegates’ duties
may include liaising with other standardization organizations. Here are other major groups and a
short description of what they do and points of contact for more information.
   2.8.1. American, British, Canadian, Australian and New Zealand Armies’ Program (ABCA).
   ABCA is an IMS organization similar to the ASIC, which focuses on the Five Armies
   working together to optimize coalition interoperability between land forces. Like ASIC,
   ABCA originated as a result of the close cooperation that developed between the Allied
   Armies during World War II. This relationship was formalized in 1947 when the Plan to
   Effect Standardization was initiated between the Armies of the United States, United
   Kingdom and Canada. The ABCA Program was formally established on 12 December 1949,
   and in 1954, the plan was progressed into the Basic Standardization Concept. In 1963,
   Australia joined the organization, and in 1964, the Basic Standardization Agreement (BSA
   64) was ratified by the four participating Armies. BSA 64 serves as the current legal
   foundation for the ABCA Program. New Zealand gained observer status in 1965 and was
   admitted as a full program member in 2006. The USMC became associate members within
   the US delegation in 2004. ABCA WGs are known as Quinquepartite Working Groups
   (QWGs) and they develop and promulgate agreements called Quinquepartite Standardization
   Agreements (QSTAGs). The US Army Materiel Command manages US participation in
   ABCA. USAF receives proposed QSTAGs, QWG meeting agendas and minutes called
   MFRs for review and comment. The Army uses these USAF comments (called a position) to
   formulate the joint US position to ABCA. The USAF limits its involvement in ABCA
   Armies to those QWGs concerned with air power issues. The ABCA Armies Standardization
   Program Handbook contains more details on the organization and its functions.
   2.8.2. Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, United States Navies
   (AUSCANNZUKUS).         Designed to promote interoperability between naval forces,
   AUSCANNZUKUS is also an IMS organization similar to ASIC. The aim of this
   organization is to ensure allied naval units have sufficient command, control, and
   communications (C3) interoperability to be able to participate effectively in all forms of

                                           Chapter 4

         THE INTERNATIONAL MILITARY STANDARDIZATION PROCESS

4.1. Purpose. Each organization has different procedures for developing and ratifying ISAs.
However, the overall processes are similar. This chapter describes in general terms the NATO
and ASIC document creation processes.
4.2. Developing ISAs. Development of an IMS agreement begins with a proposal to
standardize a particular aspect of multinational operations, a specific weapon system or system
component, or a logistical support item or process. The purpose of standardization is to increase
operational effectiveness and/or economize effort.
   4.2.1. NATO Proposal System. NATO MCASB uses the proposal system to develop NATO
   Standards. Any NATO Nation or Major NATO Command can submit a proposal for
   standardization to the MCASB. The appropriate Service Board will check the proposal for
   duplication of effort, military necessity and adherence to the organization’s policy. This
   validation process is accomplished through the use of a validation questionnaire sent to the
   nations. At this point, nations and MNCs provide their inputs. If sufficient consensus exists
   on the need to develop a standard, the Service Board will task the WG to develop a
   STANAG or AP. Alternatively, the proposal validation process can be accomplished during
   a WG meeting. In this case, the validation questionnaire is provided to the Service Board
   with a recommendation. If the proposal passes the validation process, the Service Board will
   open a Study, assign a Study number, and appoint a custodian. From this point, the WG
   becomes the focal point for developing the IMS agreement, known at this stage as a Study.
   The Service Board will appoint a custodian to gather inputs from other national delegates and
   draft a NATO Standard. HoDs and custodians should refer to NATO Allied Administrative
   Publication 3 (AAP-3), Procedures for the Development, Preparation, Production and the
   Updating of NATO Standardization Agreements and Allied Publications, and Military
   Agency for Standardization Administrative Instruction (MASAI).
   4.2.2. ASIC Project System. ASIC uses a project system to develop Air Standards and
   Advisory Publications. A member nation (or National Director) can propose the creation of a
   project to evaluate the extent or need for further standardization in a particular area. The
   proposed project covers a specific topic in the WG purview according to the WG’s Directive.
   Each nation validates the need for the project. Once approved, each nation appoints a
   member of the national delegation as project officer to study the subject. One of the nation’s
   project officers will also serve as custodian for the project and any AIR STDs or ADV PUBs
   developed under the project. The custodian will lead the project development effort and
   compile revisions and updates to the AIR STD or ADV PUB. For more details on
   development of ASIC agreements and the project system see the ASIC Instructions.
   4.2.3. Custodian of ISA. A USAF delegate assigned as the custodian of an ISA is key to
   developing the agreement and keeping it current through revisions or amendments. When in
   the preliminary stages of developing an agreement, revision or amendment, the custodian
   must coordinate directly with the delegates from the other nations and the US Air Force
   Terminologist. The HoD, MC rep, NPM or custodian should send an information copy of
   correspondence with other nations to AF/A5XX-ISO to update the action item suspense list.
AFI60-106 30 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                 29


   The custodian must take particular care to ensure ISAs are properly documented in national
   implementing documents.
   4.2.4. National Review. Once the custodian or project officer(s) drafts an IMS agreement,
   they send it to each national HoD or MC rep from the WG requesting the other nations
   review and comment on the draft. The custodian or project officer incorporates these
   comments into a second draft and sends it to the HoDs or MC rep for review and comments
   again. This draft and review process may take several cycles before the proposed IMS
   agreement is acceptable to all or most of the nations. Frequently, (for NATO IMS
   documents) the final Study Draft or proposed Ratification Draft is reviewed by the WG in
   session prior to delivery to the tasking IMS authority. When the document is acceptable to
   all or most of the nations, the WG turns the document over to the tasking IMS authority
   (NATO MCASB Service Board or ASIC MC).
   4.2.5. Ratification Review. The IMS authority circulates the IMS agreement to the nations
   and when a sufficient number, as determined by the IMS authority, have returned their
   national ratification details, the tasking authority promulgates and publishes the IMS
   agreement. The custodian or project officer keeps the document current by drafting revisions
   and amendments when needed. WGs continually review promulgated ISAs for validity.
   4.2.6. NAFAG Process for IMS Review. Within NAFAG the development of STANAGs is
   the responsibility of the AIR Group cognizant of related activity. When a NAFAG AIR
   Group undertakes development of a STANAG, a working group is typically formed to
   prepare the agreement. After the AIR Group is satisfied with the proposed STANAG it is
   provided to the Defense Support Division of the International Staff for ratification
   processing.
   4.2.7. Cover-sheeting.     Occasionally, one IMS organization will adopt another
   standardization organization's or member nation’s agreement in its entirety in a process
   known as “cover-sheeting.” The standard in question may be from a military, industrial,
   governmental, or international commercial standardization organization. For example, ASIC
   might take a NATO STANAG and reissue it with a cover-sheet designating it as an ASIC
   AIR STD. ASIC, NATO, and ABCA all cover-sheet ISAs.
4.3. Negotiating Agreements. AF/A5XX-ISO oversees US involvement in developing and
negotiating ISAs. US Joint Publications related to WG documents must be the basis for US IMS
positions as stipulated by CJCSI 2700.01:
   4.3.1. Implementation of ISAs. An IMS agreement entered into by USAF and the other
   Services is a good faith commitment requiring implementation subject to any stated
   reservation. Although not necessarily the “signature authority” of an IMS agreement, USAF
   HoDs and MC rep, act for the entire USAF and other Services. Consequently, thorough and
   proper coordination within USAF and other Services is essential. NOTE: Unlike most other
   ISAs, ISAs that provide for mutual support or cross-servicing of military equipment,
   ammunition, supplies, and stores or for mutual rendering of defense services, including
   training, are considered to constitute an international agreement. International agreements
   require proper staffing and coordination in accordance with DoDD 5530.3, International
   Agreements, and AFI 51-701, Negotiating, Concluding, Reporting and Maintaining
   International Agreements. International agreements require compliance and are legally
   binding. Close coordination with AF/A5XX-ISO and Air Force Deputy General Counsel for
 30                                                         AFI60-106 30 SEPTEMBER 2014


   Intelligence, International and Military Affairs (SAF/GCI) is required when negotiating and
   ratifying these types of agreements.
   4.3.2. Consistency with US Requirements. HoDs, negotiating standardization agreements in
   either materiel or non-materiel areas must make sure the agreements are consistent with
   appropriate US code, systems, doctrine and policies. Specifically, they must be cognizant of
   US policy regarding the use of voluntary consensus standards (as documented in DoD
   sponsored specification standards reform program).
   4.3.3. Creation of a US National Implementing Document.                HoDs negotiating
   standardization agreements in areas where there are no existing US or USAF documents in
   coordination with the document custodian must identify the agency to publish an
   implementing document and determine the time table for the implementing documents’
   completion.
4.4. Ratifying and Subscribing to Agreements. Ratification of an IMS agreement or
document is the declaration of a nation’s formal acceptance, with or without reservation, of the
content of a standardization agreement. Subscription is a Service or Agency agreement to accept
and abide by, with or without reservation, the content of a standardization agreement. Nations
ratify while Services and Defense Agencies subscribe. NOTE: The words “adopt” and
“adoption” as used throughout this AFI are meant to indicate the accomplishment of either
ratification or subscription.
   4.4.1. NATO Ratification Requests. AF/A5XX-ISO will coordinate ratification requests for
   NATO ISAs with sister Services and internal USAF organizations. Coordination will request
   the Army, Navy and Marine Corps delegates to send their Service’s subscription position,
   any recommended reservation or comments, and a recommended implementation document
   (if any) and date to the AF/A5XX-ISO by the suspense date. Reservations or comments that
   are not aligned with established joint doctrine must be resolved prior to submission to
   AF/A5XX-ISO. AF/A5XX-ISO will review the positions for consistency with known US
   policies and procedures prior to forwarding the position to the MCASB Air Board Secretariat
   for MCASB originated agreements, and to the International Staff for NAFAG originated
   agreements (with a copy to Armament Cooperation Division of the US Mission to NATO)
   and for NPC originated agreements. Ratification requests concerning doctrine will also be
   coordinated with the LeMay Center.
   4.4.2. Signature authority for NATO MCASB, NFLWG, and PHEWG IMS documents:
   AF/A5X is appointed by the USAF Chief of Staff as CSAF’s official standardization
   representative and AF/A5X is recognized by the USAF DepSO through AFPD 60-1 as the
   USAF international military standardization official. AF/A5X authorizes AF/A5XX-ISO to
   sign the actual cover document that is forwarded to the MCASB Air Board and NATO
   Petroleum Committee.
   4.4.3. ASIC Ratification Package. For ASIC documents, AF/A5XX-ISO will send the MC a
   ratification instruction package. Completion of this sheet provides the documentation which
   ensures all ISAs have been thoroughly and properly staffed. The MC rep will
   collect/coordinate appropriate Service responses to the ratification request. The USN PM
   will obtain the Department of the Navy position if it is not possible for the MC to obtain it.
   The MC rep formulates the US (Air Force, Army, Marine Corps, Navy and appropriate
   Defense Agencies) ratification position and forwards the completed package to AF/A5XX-
AFI60-106 30 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                    31


  ISO. AF/A5XX-ISO will review the completed package for consistency with known US
  policies and procedures prior to forwarding the position to the ASIC Management
  Committee. The MC rep must work closely with all Military Services’ and Defense
  Agencies’ delegates to get their positions in advance of the suspense date. The MC rep
  should inform AF/A5XX-ISO if they anticipate a delay in meeting the suspense. If 30 days
  past the suspense date one Service still has not responded, the MC rep should consider
  submitting a US ratification position reflecting a non-subscription for the tardy Service. If
  and when the MC rep gets a subscription position from the Service, notify AF/A5XX-ISO
  who will update the US national position with the ASIC MC.
  4.4.4. Signature authority for ASIC IMS documents. AF/A5X is appointed by the USAF
  Chief of Staff as the CSAF’s official standardization representative and is further recognized
  by the USAF DepSO through AFPD 60-1 as the USAF military standardization official.
  Once the MC rep has submitted a completed AF FORM 4019 to AF/A5XX-ISO, AF/A5XX-
  ISO prepares a ratification letter per the ASIC Instructions. AF/A5X authorizes AF/A5XX-
  ISO to sign ASIC IMS documents on behalf of the US ASIC National Director (AF/A5X).
  4.4.5. Service Positions. For IMS delegates/Action Offices to NATO MCASB, Army, or
  Naval Board WG or an ABCA QWG or other IMS activity, AF/A5XX-ISO will task them to
  formulate a USAF ratification position on a particular IMS document. In general, the action
  office will be tasked to respond directly to the IMS activity with an information copy to be
  sent to AF/A5XX-ISO.
  4.4.6. Guidelines When Formulating a USAF or US National Ratification Position. HoDs,
  SMEs, IMS delegates and IMS representatives should use these guidelines when formulating
  an USAF or US national ratification position.
     4.4.6.1. Confliction with Other Guidance. The US and USAF will not subscribe, ratify
     or support the adoption of any standard that conflicts with US military or US and
     international civil practices, unless a peculiar military operational requirement exists or a
     civil standard is unacceptable for military use. The US and USAF will not adopt an
     agreement that conflicts with other ratified standardization agreements or US code.
     4.4.6.2. Ratification Options. The US and USAF have these options when ratifying an
     IMS agreement:
         4.4.6.2.1. Ratify or Subscribe without reservations.
         4.4.6.2.2. Ratify or Subscribe with stated reservations. A reservation is a stated
         qualification by a nation describing the part of a standardization agreement it will not
         implement or will implement only with limitations. Reservations can be applicable to
         one Service or the entire US military. Reservations must be clear, and concise.
         4.4.6.2.3. Not ratify or subscribe. State the reasons for not ratifying or subscribing,
         to include due to no interest (while interposing no objection to other Services’
         subscription).
     4.4.6.3. No Intention to Implement. If there is no intention to implement a standard,
     USAF policy is to not ratify. If there is no objection to others ratifying, the non-
     ratification statement should state “USAF will not subscribe due to no interest (or no
     intention to implement) the subject document. USAF does not object to other nations (or
 32                                                        AFI60-106 30 SEPTEMBER 2014


       Services) ratifying/implementing the subject document.” Exceptions to this policy must
       be coordinated with AF/A5XX-ISO and/or USDELMCASB/USAF.
       4.4.6.4. Interservice-Interagency Coordination. The US ratification positions must
       include a position for all three Service components -- land, sea and air. The components
       may have the same or different subscription position. If a particular Service has no
       interest in a subject IMS document, the AF FORM 4019 must document the inter-service
       coordination and include a statement of non-interest by that Service.
4.5. Implementing and Complying With Agreements. When tasked to formulate a US
national or USAF position, the HoD, MC, or Action Office must identify an implementing
document and implementation date. Each Service fulfills its obligations in an IMS agreement
through implementation. DoD implements ISAs through US national military documents
(regulations, field manuals, etc.). Implementing Services and Agencies will ensure the
implementing document is annotated as implementing an IMS agreement and amended to
support the IMS agreement if required. A Service or the US could use the IMS agreement itself
as the implementing document (i.e. a self-implementing standard) provided they properly
distribute or make the document available to users. The implementation date is the date when
US forces (supporting NATO for NATO agreements) will comply with the provisions of the IMS
agreement. (See AFI 60-101 for guidance on materiel ISA implementation and compliance.)
   4.5.1. Implementation Documents. The USAF Action Office must determine the proper
   USAF implementing documents and implementation dates. When formulating a US national
   implementing position, HoDs and SMEs must include pertinent information concerning the
   implementing document and implementing date for all subscribing Services and defense
   agencies. The Preparing Activity of the implementing document must update the appropriate
   national implementing document by the international standardization agreement’s
   implementation date.
   4.5.2. Preparing Activity Notification. The HoD, MC rep, or other USAF Action Office
   determining the USAF implementing document must inform the national document's
   Preparing Activity as to which IMS agreement the national document implements. HoDs and
   MC reps, must ensure the Preparing Activity completes any implementing document
   revisions by the ISA’s implementation date. The update to the national document must
   include references to and provisions of the IMS agreement.
   4.5.3. Implementing Document Annotation of Inclusion in an ISA. In accordance with MIL-
   STD-961 and MIL-STD-962, preparing activities of military specifications or standards must
   show which ISA they implement and that the specification or standard has international
   implications. When amending, revising and canceling an implementing document, the
   Preparing Activity must coordinate the changes with the appropriate HoD, MC rep and AF/
   A5XX-ISO prior to the implementing document’s cancellation.
   4.5.4. Requests for Deviations from ISAs. Services or MAJCOMs may not deviate from an
   ISA without prior consultation with the signatory nations. If a USAF organization deviates
   from an US ratified ISA, it must send a deviation request to AF/A5XX-ISO.
4.6. Releasability of ISAs. Working parties occasionally evaluate their ISA for releasability to
non-member nations. NATO delegations will evaluate all NATO Unclassified STANAGs and
APs for releasability to Partnership for Peace (PfP) nations. NATO WGs will make a release
AFI60-106 30 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                               33


recommendation to the appropriate Service Board. The Service Board will release the document
only if there is a consensus (majority vote is not sufficient). US policy recommends all NATO
Unclassified ISAs for release to PfP nations.
 34                                                          AFI60-106 30 SEPTEMBER 2014


                                           Chapter 5

                                    EQUIPMENT LOANS

5.1. Loan Programs. NATO and ASIC have equipment exchange programs allowing for no-
cost loans of equipment between member nations for the purpose of test and evaluation to further
standardization. The US ratified NATO STANAG 3254, which defines the NATO equipment
loan program. Nations prepare a Combined Test Project Agreement (CTPA) document for each
loan of equipment under the program. The USAF and USN signed the ASIC Master Agreement
for the Exchange of Equipment for Test Purposes which outlines the ASIC program. Nations
prepare a Test Project Agreement (TPA) to document each individual loan of equipment. The
US must follow the provisions of Section 65 of the US Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C.
2796d) when participating in NATO and ASIC equipment exchange programs. SAF/IAPQ must
provide a copy of the negotiated loan agreement and supporting documentation to OSD for
review before entering into the agreement.
5.2. Equipment Loan Policy. Loan programs are beneficial to the US and USAF
standardization efforts. HoDs and SMEs are the equipment loan focal points and should
publicize these programs within the USAF. Equipment exchanged under these programs is
normally operationally capable or fielded for operational use, and not items in research and
development. Loaned equipment must be excess to US immediate operational requirements and
cannot be strategic or critical material. HoDs and SMEs must be able to articulate the benefits of
each equipment exchange to the US or USAF. USAF will not normally enter into a loan of
equipment valued at less than $20,000 unless the US expects a documentable gain in technical
knowledge from the testing.
   5.2.1. Cautions. HoDs and SMEs must consider the security, technology transfer and impact
   on domestic industrial manufacturing capability of the equipment exchange. Each loan
   agreement will address these and other statutory and regulatory requirements. HoDs, SMEs
   and project officers will contact their allied counterparts directly to ensure the proper test
   equipment; ancillary equipment and support are addressed in the TPA or CTPA. The USAF
   will transfer only information needed for basic operation and simple maintenance of the
   equipment for test purposes. If USAF or the borrowing nation must extend the loan duration,
   USAF and the borrowing nation may have to conclude a new agreement unless provisions for
   an automatic extension are included in the original CTPA or TPA. HoDs and SMEs should
   work with their counterparts to ensure the borrowing nation can complete the testing in the
   specified loan period.
   5.2.2. Test to Destruction. Certain types of testing will destroy the equipment as a result of
   the test. US law permits borrowing nations to test loaned equipment to destruction when
   there is sufficient benefit to USAF. The loan agreement must clearly authorize such tests.
   The borrowing nation must submit a certificate of destruction for all equipment tested to
   destruction or equipment accidentally destroyed during test. Equipment pre-positioned for
   the NATO Aircraft Cross-Servicing Program is not a loan of equipment and will adhere to
   guidelines prescribed in STANAG 3430.
5.3. Equipment Loan Process. Normally, requests for equipment loans should originate in the
WG. For requests originated outside a WG, AF/A5XX-ISO will determine the HoD with
AFI60-106 30 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                     35


functional area responsibility and task that HoD to work the request. The following steps outline
the equipment loan process:
   5.3.1. Loan Requests (ASIC TPAs). Potential borrowing nations submit equipment
   exchange requests through the US member of the appropriate ASIC WG and as coordinated
   with the NPM. AF/A5XX-ISO will coordinate with the appropriate HoD to appoint a US
   project officer. The potential borrowing nation’s ASIC National Director requests the loan of
   equipment from the potential lending nation’s ASIC National Director. Prior to the official
   request being sent by the potential borrowing nation’s National Director, the project officers
   should pre-coordinate all staffing items so that the official request can be processed in the
   most expeditious manner. The ASIC Instructions contain the standard request format. The
   project officer should be familiar with the technical details and availability of the equipment
   and provide AF/A5XX-ISO with requested information (copy the information to the NPM).
   5.3.2. Loan Agreement Staffing and Approval. AF/A5XX-ISO will assist in staffing the
   final approval on all CTPAs and TPAs. AF/A5XX-ISO will use the information provided by
   the project officer to prepare a draft loan agreement and supporting memorandums. Then
   AF/A5XX-ISO will coordinate these draft documents with the HoD and the project officer.
   Technology transfer, legal and financial implications, security, impact on domestic industrial
   base and benefit of the loan to USAF are some of the items considered in these documents.
   AF/A5XX-ISO will submit draft agreement to the Air Force International Cooperative
   Programs Office (SAF/IAPQ). Note: SAF/IAPQ will also be involved in the steps before
   draft is submitted from AF/A5XX-ISO.
       5.3.2.1. SAF/IAPQ staffs the draft loan agreement with appropriate HQ USAF offices to
       include SAF/GCI, SAF/IAPD, SAF/IARW, the appropriate SAF/AQ Directorate(s),
       SAF/IA regional division(s), and other offices, as appropriate. When HQ USAF staff has
       comments, changes, or otherwise does not approve the documents, SAF/IAPQ
       adjudicates them, then re-staffs as necessary. Upon completion of HQ USAF staffing,
       SAF/IAPQ initiates negotiations, as Office of the Under Secretary of Defense
       (Acquisition, Technology, & Logistics)/International Cooperation OUSD (AT&L)/IC has
       delegated the authority to develop loan agreements to the USAF.
       5.3.2.2. The HoD or MC rep and the project officer will monitor the equipment test
       progress for the duration of the loan period. They will notify AF/A5XX-ISO when they
       receive the equipment or a certificate of destruction (if required). Within 60 days of test
       completion, the borrowing project officer will produce a test report, coordinate it with the
       lending project officer and distribute it as approved by both nations. The borrowing
       nation will pay all costs to publish and distribute the test report.
       5.3.2.3. Loaning equipment does not relieve the owner of the equipment of remaining in
       compliance with DoDI 5000.64, Accountability and Management of DoD Equipment and
       Other Accountable Property.
 36                                                        AFI60-106 30 SEPTEMBER 2014


                                          Chapter 6

        INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AND INTERNATIONAL MILITARY
                        STANDARDIZATION

6.1. Purpose. Information management is an important aspect of producing standardization
agreements. The purpose of this chapter is to detail how IMS information is procured and
maintained.
6.2. Suspense Listing. Once every three months AF/A5XX-ISO generates a suspense list
showing all IMS action items overdue, due now or due in the future. AF/A5XX-ISO uses this
list to calculate the success of the USAF actions to meet USAF obligations in IMS programs.
AF/A5XX-ISO updates the list when it receives replies to action items, receives the information
copy based on action items from USDELMCASB/USAF and inputs (telephone calls, faxes, e-
mails, and letters) on other actions completed. When action offices receive the listing, they
should review their portion and submit any updates.
6.3. IMS Files. Each Action Office should maintain current IMS files for their working parties.
These files should include past correspondence dealing with the WG -- meeting reports, copies
of the WGs existing and developing ISAs, and copies of the pertinent reference documents.
Action Offices may request replacements from AF/A5XX-ISO.
6.4. Security Procedures. Security procedures are as follows:
   6.4.1. Informational Release Policy. USAF personnel involved in IMS must obtain
   authorization to release classified and unclassified US information to foreign personnel. AFI
   16-201, DoDM 5200.01, AFI 31-401, and DoD 5220.22R/AFI 31-601 provide guidance on
   the disclosure of information. SAF/IAPD will provide further guidance on disclosure as
   needed.
   6.4.2. Security Clearances. USAF personnel involved in IMS must have the appropriate
   security clearance for access to foreign and NATO classified information. USAF personnel
   must safeguard and handle classified information according to DoD 5200.1M/AFI 31-401,
   and AFI 31-501.
   6.4.3. Visit Requests of Foreign Nationals. Foreign personnel wishing to attend IMS
   meetings in the US should request visit authorization through their embassy. SAF/ IAPD
   will specify what level of US information these individuals may view in the visit
   authorization.
   6.4.4. ASIC Management Committee Members.               AF/A5XX-ISO will obtain from
   SAF/IAPD extended visit authorizations for the allied personnel assigned to the ASIC MC.
   6.4.5. NATO Access. All delegates to NATO WGs must have authorization to access NATO
   classified information before attending a meeting. Even if the WG meeting is conducted at
   the NATO Unclassified level, a NATO Secret or higher security clearance is required for
   unrestricted access to HQ NATO. Delegates can obtain a NATO security brief (per AFI 31-
   401) from their unit security manager. Assuming that an individual has a current US security
   clearance, a new security investigation is not required for a NATO security clearance.
AFI60-106 30 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                  37


6.5. Terminology Documents and Use. Each IMS organization has a terminology document
explaining and defining terms used in each organization. These documents are NATO Glossary
of Military Terms and Definitions (AAP-6). ABCA uses NATO’s AAP-6. Joint Pub 1-02
defines terms used by the US Services. USAF personnel should use terms as defined by the
particular IMS organization.
6.6. Document Posting and Distribution. There are different rules for the posting and
distribution of the various documents produced in NATO and ASIC. For specific details on
obtaining documents, please contact AF/A5XX-ISO. ASIC and NATO both have websites
where documents are posted. For DOD-wide standardization document inquiries, the ASSIST
website is available to eligible users.
   6.6.1. NATO Documents. May be found at the NSO website or on the ASSIST website.
       6.6.1.1. NSO address: http://nso.nato.int/nso
       6.6.1.2. ASSIST address: https://assist.dla.mil/online/start/
   6.6.2. ASIC documents may be found at the ASIC website or on the ASSIST website.
       6.6.2.1. ASIC website: https://teams.nzdf.mil.nz/sites/ASIC/default.aspx
   6.6.3. Classified IMS documents. Classified publications should be ordered directly through
   AF/A5XX-ISO. If you need more information on obtaining a classified IMS document, send
   a written request with justification and proof of security clearance to AF/A5XX-ISO.
6.7. US and USAF Hosted IMS Meetings. The US hosts each ASIC WG meeting in rotation
with the other nations (one meeting in five). NATO HoDs may occasionally volunteer to host a
NATO Air Board WG meeting provided they have sufficient time, funds and French-English
translation capabilities. When planning to host a meeting, the HoD must:
   6.7.1. Coordinate all meeting activities with the hosting facility, AF/A5XX-ISO, each
   nation's delegation and the appropriate international agency (NATO MCASB or ASIC MC).
   6.7.2. Complete all security and clearance arrangements before the meeting to include
   coordination through SAF/IAPD or your local disclosure authority for release of USAF
   information. Specifically, inform each allied delegation of any added or planned visits so
   that the foreign clearance request may include such information.
   6.7.3. Arrange for administrative support to include meeting facilities, secretarial services
   (typing and reproduction), lodging, dining, local transportation, area information packages,
   local area maps and simultaneous interpretation (translation), as required.
