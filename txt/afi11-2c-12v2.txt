                                          Chapter 1

                                GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. AFMC/A3V is the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for the three-volume
set of C-12 instructions. These instructions are numbered AFI 11-2C-12 Volume 1, 2, and 3, and
will contain the training, evaluation criteria, and operations procedures, respectively. In the
absence of published guidance units will coordinate with AFMC/A3V for approval of locally
developed guidelines.
   1.1.1. All evaluations will be conducted in accordance with (IAW) the provisions of AFI 11-
   202V2 and this instruction. Information gathering documents will be established as forms in
   accordance with AFI 33-360.
   1.1.2. Guidance in aircraft flight manuals, performance manuals, and Technical Orders
   (T.O.s) are the primary references for operation of the corresponding aircraft.
1.2. Recommended Changes/Waivers. Recommendations for improvements to this instruction
will be submitted on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, to AFMC/A3V,
508 W Choctawhatchee Ave, Suite 4, Eglin AFB FL 32542-5713. IAW AFPD 11-2, AF/XO is
approval authority for interim changes/revisions to this instruction. Waiver authority for this
instruction is AFMC/A3V. Waivers will be submitted on AFMC Form 73, AFMC Flight
Operations Waiver Request, through Stan/Eval channels to AFMC/A3V.
1.3. Procedures:
   1.3.1. Standardization and Evaluation (Stan/Eval) Flight Examiners (SEFE) will use the
   evaluation criteria contained in Chapter 3 for conducting all flight evaluations and
   paragraph 1.5 for all emergency procedures evaluations (EPEs). To ensure standard and
   objective evaluations, SEFEs will be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed evaluation
   criteria.
   1.3.2. Unless specified, the examinee or SEFE may fly in any seat which will best enable the
   SEFE to conduct a thorough evaluation.
   1.3.3. The SEFE will brief the examinee on the purpose of the evaluation and how it will be
   conducted prior to flight. The examinee will accomplish required flight planning in
   accordance with the duty position during the evaluation. Flight Examiners will be furnished a
   copy of necessary mission data, and mission materials.
   1.3.4. The SEFE will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the flight. This debrief will include
   the examinee's overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than
   qualified) and any required additional training. If the overall grade is Q-2 or Q-3, a unit
   supervisor must attend the debrief.
1.4. Grading Instructions. This instruction contains the standards and criteria for conducting
evaluations in C-12 aircraft. These standards when applied with SEFE judgment are the
determining factor in awarding area and overall evaluation grades.
   1.4.1. The SEFE will evaluate flight parameters based on conditions of smooth air and a
   stable aircraft. Do not consider momentary deviations from tolerances, provided the
 4                                                            AFI11-2C-12V2 24 MARCH 2008


     examinee applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flying
     safety. The SEFE will consider cumulative deviations when determining the overall grade.
     1.4.2. The SEFE will evaluate each area accomplished during the evaluation using the
     standards provided in this instruction and assign an appropriate grade for the area. Derive the
     overall flight evaluation grade from a composite of the area grades. SEFE judgment must be
     exercised when the wording of areas is subjective and when specific situations are not
     covered. SEFE judgment will be the determining factor in arriving at the overall grade.
     1.4.3. If the examinee receives an unqualified grade in any critical area, an overall
     unqualified grade will be assigned.
     1.4.4. Examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade will be placed in supervised status
     until a re-evaluation is successfully accomplished. Examinees receiving an overall
     unqualified grade because of an unsatisfactory Bold Face evaluation will not be permitted to
     fly in their aircrew position until a successful re-evaluation is accomplished. If examinee
     receives a grade of qualified with additional training required for an EPE, the SEFE will
     indicate if the additional training will be accomplished before the flight evaluation.
     Additional training and re-evaluations will be accomplished IAW AFI11-202V2.
     1.4.5. The following general criteria apply during all phases of flight except as noted for
     specific events and on instrument final approaches:

Table 1.1. General Criteria.

1.5. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). Aircrew will be administered EPEs. Use an
Aircrew Training Device (ATD) to perform EPEs (when available and properly configured) to
the maximum extent possible. If an ATD is not used, the EPE will be an oral evaluation.
     1.5.1. The following items, as applicable, will be included on all emergency procedures
     evaluations:
        1.5.1.1. Aircraft General Knowledge.
AFI11-2C-12V2 24 MARCH 2008                                                                 5


       1.5.1.2. Emergency Procedures. Evaluate a minimum of two emergency procedures per
       phase of flight (i.e., pre-takeoff, takeoff, cruise and landing). All Bold Face will be
       evaluated (if applicable).
       1.5.1.3. Crew Resource Management (CRM).
   1.5.2. The following additional items will be included on EPEs as a requisite for the
   instrument and/or qualification evaluation (if applicable):
       1.5.2.1. Evaluate use of standby/emergency instruments.
       1.5.2.2. Alternate/Divert Airfields. Evaluate a minimum of one approach at an airfield
       other than the base/airfield of assignment, mission & conditions permitting.
       1.5.2.3. Evaluate loss of visual references in close proximity to the runway (low
       visibility landings) including use of night vision devices during takeoff/landing, if
       authorized.
       1.5.2.4. Evaluate transition to instruments in a spatial disorientation incident.
   1.5.3. EPE scenarios should be tailored to unit tasking and should include emergencies
   occurring during situations an aircrew might encounter while flying the unit’s mission.
   1.5.4. The following grading criteria will be used to grade individual items on EPEs:
    Q: Performance is correct. Quickly recognizes and corrects errors.

                                            Chapter 2

                              EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1. General.
     2.1.1. All evaluations will follow the guidelines set in AFI 11-202V2, Chapter 5. The
     procedures outlined in this chapter apply to all flying units.
     2.1.2. Requirements for aircrew evaluations are detailed in Chapter 3. The flight phase of
     the evaluation may be accomplished in the equivalent of an FAA Level D or greater Aircrew
     Training Device (ATD).
        2.1.2.1. Takeoffs and landings should be accomplished/evaluated in flight.
     2.1.3. Evaluate all issued flight publications for currency and accuracy on all flight
     evaluations. Units may specify additional publications to be evaluated in the unit supplement
     to AFI 11-202V2.
        2.1.3.1. If digital T.O.s are used, in addition to a check for currency, the publications
        review conducted as part of an evaluation will include:
            2.1.3.1.1. The examinee will demonstrate the ability to navigate through and locate
            information in the electronic media.
            2.1.3.1.2. The examinee will demonstrate the ability to locate information in paper
            publications required for in-flight use (i.e. checklists, publication kits, etc).
2.2. Instrument Evaluation. A mission flown according to instrument flight rules (to the
maximum extent practical) best fulfills the objective of the instrument evaluation. This
evaluation will include approaches at airfields other than the base of assignment or deployed
locations if possible. This evaluation may be administered on any compatible mission with the
approval of the unit Chief of Stan/Eval and Commander's concurrence.
     2.2.1. The minimum ground phase requisite is the instrument examination.
     2.2.2. Minimum In-Flight Events.
        2.2.2.1. Instrument Approaches. Evaluate three instrument approaches to include at least
        one precision and one non-precision approach.
            2.2.2.1.1. Precision Approach. One precision instrument approach must be flown. An
            Instrument Landing System (ILS) or Precision Approach Radar (PAR) approach may
            fulfill this requirement.
            2.2.2.1.2. Non-precision Approach. Accomplish at least one non-precision approach.
        2.2.2.2. Holding or Procedure Turn. Every attempt should be made to accomplish this
        event. However, if mission constraints prevent accomplishment, this may be evaluated
        on the ground.
        2.2.2.3. Circling Approach. Every attempt should be made to accomplish this event.
        However, if mission constraints prevent accomplishment, this may be evaluated on the
        ground. It may be combined, as appropriate, with the non-precision approach
        requirement.
AFI11-2C-12V2 24 MARCH 2008                                                                     7


       2.2.2.4. Deleted
2.3. Qualification Evaluation. Requirements for a pilot qualification evaluation are the same
as an instrument evaluation with the following exceptions and requirements:
   2.3.1. Minimum ground phase requisites are closed and open book examinations, EPE, and
   Bold Face Written Exam. Answers must contain all Bold Face items in proper sequence.
   Abbreviations are allowed.
   2.3.2. No instrument approaches or procedures (holding, instrument penetration) are
   required. A full or partial flap pattern and landing is required. Emergency pattern work to
   include a simulated engine failure immediately after takeoff, engine out go around/missed
   approach, engine out approach and landing , and a no flap approach and landing are also
   required. A Visual Flight Rules (VFR) traffic pattern is required (weather permitting).
   2.3.3. Pilots will be evaluated on compliance with National Airspace System rules and
   procedures. Particularly, evaluate compliance with minimum safe maneuvering airspeeds
   below 10,000 feet Mean Sea Level (MSL) using criteria in Table 1.1, as well as using all
   means available to ensure safe operations (e.g., Flight following during VFR operations).
   NOTE: Individuals whose primary duty station is overseas may be evaluated on knowledge
   and application of appropriate International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) rules and
   procedures to meet the intent of this paragraph.
2.4. Instructor Evaluation. Initial Instructor and Instructor Requalification evaluations will be
conducted IAW AFI 11-202V2, Chapter 4. Flight evaluations will include a thorough evaluation
of the examinee's instructor knowledge and ability. The instructor candidate will demonstrate to
the evaluator an EPE. This is a one-time check in which the examinee must demonstrate the
ability to instruct in various phases of the unit’s mission. Instruction should include both
demonstrations and error analysis. Additionally, when possible the examinee should demonstrate
the ability to accurately apply grading standards. The examinee’s ability to analyze deficiencies
and impart constructive criticism is an integral part of this evaluation. Except for requirements
detailed on AFMC Form 59, Fixed Wing Pilot, 20070531 with the C-12 overlay, specific profiles
and/or events will be determined by the SEFE. All subsequent periodic evaluations (for example,
Instrument (INSTM), Qualification (QUAL)) will include instructor portions during the
evaluations. Initial and Requal Instructor Evaluations will include the applicable portions of the
following sections: General, Ground, Qualification, and Instructor.
2.5. Spot Evaluation. Spot evaluations will be conducted IAW AFI 11-202V2, Chapter 4. A
SPOT evaluation is an evaluation not intended to satisfy the requirements of a periodic (i.e.,
INSTM, QUAL) evaluation. A spot has no particular requisites or requirements, but may be
converted into a periodic evaluation if all of the requirements for that evaluation are met. SEFE
objectivity evaluations will be documented as SPOT evaluations.
2.6. Administrative Upgrade.
   2.6.1. Purpose. Use the administrative upgrade to document completion of Aircraft
   Commander requirements without administering an evaluation.

with the fuel reserves specified in 11-2C-12 Vol. 3.
Minimum Fuel—Fuel state, where, upon reaching the destination, the aircraft can accept little or
no delay. This is not an emergency situation but merely indicates an emergency situation is
possible should any undue delay occur.
Emergency Fuel—Fuel state requires immediate traffic priority to safely recover the aircraft. An
emergency will be declared and the aircraft immediately recovered at the nearest suitable field.
Global Decision Support System (GDSS)—AMC primary execution command and control
system. GDSS is used to manage the execution of AMC airlift and tanker missions.

Hazardous Cargo or Materials (HAZMAT)—Articles or substances that are capable of posing
significant risk to health, safety, or property when transported by air and classified as explosive
(class 1), compressed gas (class 2), flammable liquid (class 3), flammable solid (class 4) oxidizer
and organic peroxide (class 5), poison and infectious substances (class 6), radioactive material
(class 7), corrosive material (class 8), or miscellaneous dangerous goods (class 9). Classes may
be subdivided into divisions to further identify hazard (i.e., 1.1, 2.3, 6.1, etc.).
Initial Cadre—Those personnel assigned to conduct flight testing of experimental,
developmental, or new aircraft for which there are no established formal training programs nor
standardized evaluation criteria. Initial Cadre designations are appropriate through Initial
Operational Capability.
Instructor Supervision—Supervision by an instructor of like specialty (see also Direct
Instructor Supervision).

Forces (MAF) including crewmembers and/or aircraft from AETC, ACC, PACAF, USAFE,
AMC, ANG and AFRC forces not gained by AFMC.
Knock-it-Off—A term any crewmember may call to terminate a training maneuver. Upon
hearing ―
        knock-it-off‖ the crew should establish a safe altitude, airspeed and return the aircraft
power and flight controls to a normal configuration.
Letter of “X”s—A document used by units, signed by appropriate authority, that lists each
assigned/attached aircrew’s aircraft designation, crew position, and mission qualifications.
