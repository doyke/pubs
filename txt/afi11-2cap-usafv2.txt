                                           Chapter 1

                                          GENERAL

1.1. Conducting Evaluations. Units will conduct all evaluations according to the provisions of
AFI 11-202, Volume 2, and this instruction.
1.2. Procedures:
   1.2.1. Flight examiners (FE), including civilian examiners, will use the evaluation criteria in
   Chapter 3 for conducting flight and emergency procedures evaluations (EPE). To ensure
   standard and objective evaluations, FEs must become thoroughly familiar with the evaluation
   requirements and criteria in this instruction.
   1.2.2. Unless specified, the examinee will fly in the seat that best enables the FE to conduct a
   thorough evaluation. The FE normally occupies the left seat during periodic instructor
   mission evaluations.
   1.2.3. Prior to the flight, the FE will brief the examinee on the purpose of the evaluation and
   how it will be conducted. The examinee will accomplish required flight planning during the
   evaluation and will furnish the FE a copy of necessary mission data and maps (as required).
   1.2.4. The FE will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the evaluation. Debriefs include the
   examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than qualified),
   and any required additional training. If the overall grade is Q-2 or Q-3, the FE must notify
   CAP-USAF/XOV.
   1.2.5. FEs must be glass cockpit (G-1000) certified to give initial or periodic qualification
   (QUAL) or instrument (INSTM) evaluations to G-1000 certified members in a G-1000
   aircraft.
1.3. Grading Instructions:
   1.3.1. Tolerances in performance parameters are based on conditions of smooth air and a
   stable aircraft. Do not consider momentary deviations from tolerances, provided the
   examinee applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flying
   safety. Consider cumulative deviations when determining the overall grade.
   1.3.2. FEs will use the evaluation criteria in Table 1.1 and Table 3.1 to determine individual
   area grades. When individual areas are performed well above the grading criteria standards,
   make an appropriate comment under Examiner’s Remarks in the Comments block of the AF
   Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, or AF Form 8a, Certificate of Aircrew
   Qualification (Multiple Aircraft), stating performance and (or) instruction was commendable.
   FEs must use judgment when the evaluation criterion is subjective or the specific situation is
   not covered.
   1.3.3. FEs will derive the overall flight evaluation grade (Q-1, Q-2, or Q-3) from the area
   grades, based on a composite for the observed events and tasks according to AFI 11-202,
   Volume 2, this instruction, and FE judgment. If the examinee receives an unqualified area
   grade in any of the areas identified by this instruction, the FE will assign an overall
   unqualified grade (Q-3).

        1.3.4. Critical areas require adequate accomplishment by the examinee in order to
        successfully achieve the mission objectives. If the examinee receives an unqualified grade in
        any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will be unqualified (Q-3). Critical areas
        are identified in Chapter 3. Grade critical areas as "Q" or "U."
        1.3.5. The general evaluation criteria in Table 1.1 apply during all phases of flight (except as
        noted in Table 3.1 for specific events).

1.4. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). FEs will administer an oral EPE on the
ground. The FE will include a sampling of emergency procedures resolved to a logical
conclusion.
        1.4.1. The FE will include an evaluation of the following items on the EPE:
           1.4.1.1. General Knowledge. Evaluate aircraft systems and operating procedures, the
           national airspace system, and nontowered airfield operations.
           1.4.1.2. Emergency Procedures. Evaluate all BOLDFACE or critical action procedures
           and at least one emergency procedure.
        1.4.2. Units will not permit examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade (Q-3) because
        of an unsatisfactory EPE to fly in any aircrew position until the examinee completes a
        successful reevaluation.
        1.4.3. For each EPE graded ―qualified with additional training required,‖ the FE will indicate
        whether the additional training must be accomplished before the next flight.
1.5. Completing AF Form 8 or Form 8a. Evaluators record aircrew member qualifications
using the AF Form 8 or 8a in accordance with (IAW) AFI 11-202, Volume 2.
        1.5.1. With the exception of restrictions and exceptionally qualified designation (if used),
        place all comments on the reverse side of the AF Form 8 or 8a.
        1.5.2. Record additional aircraft upgrades, not requiring a flight evaluation, on AF Form
        1381, USAF Certificate of Air Crew Training¸ or AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew
        Certifications, and maintain in the flight evaluation folder.
1.6. Waiver and Approval Authorities. Except where specified in this instruction, each
MAJCOM Director of Operations (A3) is the waiver authority for individual aircrew provisions
of this instruction. Units will submit waiver requests through the chain of command to the OPR.

                                               Chapter 2

                                EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1. General. There are four types of evaluations in CAP-USAF aircraft: QUAL, instructor
(INSTR), INSTM, and SPOT. The requirement for a mission evaluation is waived by this
instruction according to the provisions of AFI 11-202, Volume 2. Evaluations include requisites
and required areas. Table 2.1 indicates when a requisite is required for an evaluation. Table 2.2
prescribes required areas that must be included in the flight evaluation profile. Evaluation areas
are aligned under the type of evaluation.
      2.1.1. For the purposes of this instruction, all CAP-USAF aircraft are a single USAF mission
      design series equivalent. Qualification in any CAP-USAF aircraft is qualification for all
      CAP-USAF aircraft, although additional aircraft equipment certifications may be required
      according to AFI 11-2CAP-USAF, Volume 1, CAP-USAF Aircrew Training. For G-1000
      certified aircrew, periodic evaluations will be accomplished in G-1000 aircraft with a G-
      1000-certified FE.
      2.1.2. When it is impossible or impractical to evaluate a required area in flight, the FE may
      evaluate it by oral examination to complete the evaluation. Landings cannot be evaluated
      orally. Document the oral evaluation in the Examiner’s Remarks in the Comments block of
      the AF Form 8 or 8a. If the FE determines the required item cannot be adequately evaluated
      orally, the examinee will require an additional flight to complete the evaluation.
      2.1.3. A publications check is not required.
2.2. Requisites. Table 2.1 indicates the minimum requisites for each type of evaluation. When
periodic evaluations are combined, accomplish all requisites for each evaluation and document in
the ground phase of the AF Form 8 or 8a.

2.3. Pilot Evaluations. All pilot evaluations are combined QUAL and INSTM evaluations. The
examinee normally flies in the left seat. AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, Instrument Flight
Procedures, provides guidance and procedures for instrument flying.
     2.3.1. Use either a precision approach radar (PAR) or instrument landing system (ILS) to
     satisfy the precision approach requirement.
     2.3.2. Use either an airport surveillance radar (ASR), very high frequency omnidirectional
     range (VOR), localizer (LOC), or area navigation approach to satisfy the nonprecision
     approach requirement.
2.4. Instructor Pilot Evaluations. To initially qualify as an instructor, a pilot must successfully
complete a dedicated initial instructor evaluation. Subsequently, crewmembers designated as
instructors will be evaluated on their ability to instruct during all periodic evaluations. All
periodic INSTR evaluations are combined with aircraft QUAL/INSTM evaluations to evaluate
both proficiency and instructor ability. The examinee normally flies in the right seat, but left-seat
evaluations may be accomplished. The FE will act as a student for the purpose of evaluating the
examinee’s instructional ability. Include at least one maneuver from each of areas 20 to 23, 27 to
29, 35 to 38, and 47 to 48 in the flight evaluation profile.
