     1.1.2. Restrictive sanctions and duty restrictions accompanying academic, conduct, aptitude,
     and athletic probation are at the discretion of the cadet’s commander. For honor probation,
     restrictions are at the discretion of the Commandant of Cadets. Applicability, clarification,

                                           Chapter 2

                       ACADEMIC REVIEW COMMITTEE (ARC)

2.1. Deficiency in Academics.
   2.1.1. Official grades are released by Dean of the Faculty, Office of the Registrar (DFR) at
   each mid-semester, end of semester, and end of third summer term. Once released, official
   grades are immediately retrievable by Cadets and AOCs in the Cadet Administrative
   Management Information System (CAMIS). Upon release of official grades, any cadet with
   an academic deficiency, as defined in Chapter 5 of the Curriculum Handbook, is on academic
   probation.
   2.1.2. Academic deficiency is defined in the Curriculum Handbook, Chapter 5. The cadet
   will remain on academic probation until the deficiency is corrected, at a minimum, until the
   next progress report. Although a cadet may appear to be no longer academically deficient
   through ARC action (e.g., dropping course and/or changing major), the cadet will remain on
   academic probation until the next progress report.
   2.1.3. Cadets may be removed from academic probation at mid-semester, at the end of a
   semester, or at the end of a summer term. Returning cadets who at the time of their departure
   from the United States Air Force Academy, were on academic probation will be on academic
   probation upon their return unless they successfully establish, in a written appeal to the
   chairperson of their class-year ARC, they are no longer academically deficient as defined in
   Chapter 5 of the Curriculum Handbook.
   2.1.4. At the end of each semester, the ARC will review all cadets on academic probation.
   The ARC may make retention recommendations or direct actions that are likely to improve a
   cadet’s academic performance and standing.
   2.1.5. The AOCs are responsible for notifying cadets of ARC directives and for ensuring
   cadets follow through with ARC directed actions. The AOCs should also identify who in
   their squadron is on academic probation, and ensure those cadets initiate USAFA Forms 68,
   Cadet Academic Deficiency Evaluation and Probation Action Plan. The AOCs should
   engage the cadet leadership and cadet academic advisors in the mentorship of academically
   deficient cadets.
   2.1.6. Instructors will evaluate and complete Comment Cards on academically deficient
   cadets at mid-semester, end of semester, and after the end of the third summer term.
   Comment cards are required from all instructors for cadets appealing an ARC records review
   vote for disenrollment. An email notification via CAMIS will be sent to instructors of cadets
   that are requesting an ARC interview. Instructors will have 3 days to complete the additional
   comments before the updated comment cards will be pulled for the ARC interviews.
   2.1.7. Mentoring of Deficient Cadets.
      2.1.7.1. Cadet Academic Officers, Cadet Squadron leadership, Academic Advisors, and
      AOCs are responsible for ensuring probationary cadets receive initial counseling and
      consistent academic mentoring throughout the probationary period. Initial counseling is
      documented utilizing the USAFA Form 68.
 6                                                        USAFAI36-3523 22 FEBRUARY 2012


            2.1.7.1.1. Probationary cadets have 10 duty days from the date official grades are
            released to complete the USAFA Form 68.
        2.1.7.2. Upon the release of official grades, AOCs should provide a list of academically
        deficient cadets to the Cadet Academic Officer (CADO). The CADO then engages the
        cadet leadership of probationary cadets and ensures each probationary cadet initiates a
        USAFA Form 68.
     2.1.8. ARC Records Reviews. The ARC reviews the records of every academically deficient
     cadet within 10 days of the official grade release at the end of each semester and at the end of
     the summer term. The ARC Record Reviews at the end of the spring semester will be held
     before the USAFA graduation date.
        2.1.8.1. The ARC Records Review results will be released via CAMIS letters to AOCs
        and Academic Advisors within 48 hours of the records review. The AOCs will receive
        an email with a link to each probationary cadet’s 1st ARC letter that received specific
        direction from the ARC. Not all probationary cadets will receive an ARC letter.
        However, all probationary cadets must complete the USAFA Form 68 and terms of
        academic probation. The AOCs should present the ARC letters to the appropriate cadets
        within 48 hours. Cadets recommended for disenrollment may be required to immediately
        attend an appellate rights briefing and may be directed to attend the mandatory briefing
        even if the AOC has not yet presented the 1st ARC letter.
     2.1.9. Academic Advisors are required to coordinate on the USAFA Form 68 and assign
     ―Consultations‖ that are likely to lead the probationary cadet towards achieving academic
     excellence. Academic Advisors should review instructor comment cards, cadet Academic
     Program Summary (APS) and Grad check documents, and previous counseling
     documentation prior to providing initial counseling sessions for probationary cadets.
     2.1.10. The AOCs should work with their appointed squadron CADOs and cadet supervisory
     staffs to develop a cohesive academic strategy that ensures the squadron supports the
     achievement of academic excellence and motivates probationary cadets to develop and
     sustain habits that result in academic success.
     2.1.11. Removal from Academic Probation. Cadets will be removed from all conditions of
     academic probation when official grades are released that indicate the cadet is no longer
     academically deficient. If a cadet remains on academic probation longer than one semester,
     e.g., because the repeat course for a single ―F‖ grade is not offered in the succeeding
     semester, the cadet may petition the appropriate ARC chairperson (through the ARC
     coordinator in the Curriculum and Academic Affairs Division (DFRC) to be removed from
     academic probation.
2.2. Composition of the Academic Review Committee.
     2.2.1. There are four ARCs, one for each class. Each ARC is composed of the following
     members:
        2.2.1.1. Representatives of the Headquarters USAFA Dean of the Faculty (USAFA/DF):
            2.2.1.1.1. Permanent Professor (chairperson) - voting member.
            2.2.1.1.2. Two professors or associate professors or any other military and/or civilian
            member of the Faculty Forum - voting members.
USAFAI36-3523 22 FEBRUARY 2012                                                               7


          2.2.1.1.3. The USAFA/DFR Academic Affairs Staff Officer (coordinator) -
          nonvoting member.
      2.2.1.2. Representatives of the Commandant (USAFA/CW):
          2.2.1.2.1. Group or Deputy Group AOC - voting member.
          2.2.1.2.2. Representative of the Department of Athletics (USAFA/AD) - voting
          member.
      2.2.1.2.3. Representative of the 10th Medical Group (10 MDG) (need not be present but
      will submit written inputs (including negative reply) to the coordinator) - nonvoting.
      2.2.1.2.4. The cadet’s academic advisor or Associate Air Officers Commanding for
      Academics (AAOCA) and AOC are to attend interviews of cadets selected for
      disenrollment (not records review) as nonvoting members of the ARC. Whenever there
      is a conflict of ARC interviews, the advisor or AAOCA and AOC should attend the most
      senior cadet’s interview.
   2.2.2. Failure of any nonvoting member to attend an ARC will not invalidate otherwise valid
   committee proceedings.
   2.2.3. Voting members may abstain or may be asked to abstain by appealing cadets. At least
   4 voting members must participate in the vote. The ARC coordinators should attempt to find
   alternate voting members when necessary. The ARC Coordinators are authorized to vote in
   the rare occasion that two normal voting members abstain.
2.3. Academic Review Committee Responsibilities.
   2.3.1. End-of-Semester and/or Summer ARC. Full voting membership ARC meetings are
   held at the end of each semester and at the end of the third summer term (fall semester
   transition week). Reviews may include any academically deficient cadet.
      2.3.1.1. With the approval of the Dean, the ARC recommends cadets for disenrollment,
      conditional turnback status, and late graduation. The committee will recommend to the
      Dean and Superintendent that cadets deficient in studies be disenrolled unless it
      determines that both their overall performance and the probability of successful
      completion of the academic program justify a recommendation for retention.
      2.3.1.2. Decisions by the ARC to retain cadets are final without Superintendent review.
      Should the committee decide that overall performance and probability of successfully
      completing the academic program justify retention, other actions may be deemed
      necessary. Cadets may be directed to:
          2.3.1.2.1. Be counseled by the appropriate agency.
          2.3.1.2.2. Be underloaded, or take a normal load during the current or next semester.
          (See definition of underload and normal load in the USAFA Curriculum Handbook.)
          2.3.1.2.3. Repeat a course; remove an incomplete grade.
          2.3.1.2.4. Replace honors course with non-honors course.
          2.3.1.2.5. Be removed from advanced placement course to lower level course with
          the course’s sponsoring department head’s approval.
 8                                                        USAFAI36-3523 22 FEBRUARY 2012


            2.3.1.2.6. Change their academic major.
            2.3.1.2.7. Be removed from or limit participation in extracurricular activities.
            2.3.1.2.8. Be removed from or limited participation in military duties.
            2.3.1.2.9. Be automatically reviewed at a future progress report.
            2.3.1.2.10. Graduate on time with a deficiency or with an Academy Board waiver of
            a graduation requirement.
            2.3.1.2.11. Be assigned an academic minus.
Note: A recommendation of academic minus indicates that disenrollment is not warranted solely
on academic grounds. This recommendation will be forwarded to the other Academy Board
standing committees (Military Review Committee (MRC) and Physical Education Review
Committee (PERC) for consideration. If an academic minus is present, a committee should
consider for disenrollment a cadet whose deficiency in military or athletic matters might
normally result in a vote for retention. If the other committee recommends disenrollment, the
appropriate ARC chairperson will appear before the Academy Board if necessary with the other
committee chairperson to explain the reasons for the ARC recommendation. An ARC will
evaluate continued assignment of academic minus at each review.
     2.3.2. Mid-semester ARC. Each ARC will review the records of deficient cadets. No
     retention and/or disenrollment voting occurs at mid-semester.
     2.3.3. End-of-Summer Term ARC. The third class ARC will review records of deficient
     cadets who attended any of the summer academic terms.
2.4. Academic Review Committee Preparation.
     2.4.1. Committee Coordinator Responsibilities:
        2.4.1.1. Ensure committee members are trained in responsibilities and procedures.
        2.4.1.2. Distribute cadet deficiency reports at each progress report.
        2.4.1.3. Prepare and distribute record review and/or interview schedules, agendas, and
        APSs as soon as possible to members and academic departments prior to the ARC
        meetings.
        2.4.1.4. Assemble deficient cadet records and brief during committee review.
     2.4.2. Group and Squadron AOC Responsibility. The AOCs will forward evaluations to an
     ARC chairperson through group AOC members. These evaluations will include any data the
     AOC believes to be significant for ARC decision-making, i.e., suitability for commissioning,
     Weekend Academic Call to Quarters (WACQ) assigned and/or served, multiple probations,
     and personal and medical information.
     2.4.3. Academic Advisor or AAOCA Responsibility:
        2.4.3.1. Mid-semester. The ARC requires advisors to oversee cadets in all categories of
        academic probation in completing the USAFA Form 68. Overloaded cadets on academic
        probation will be required to drop the overload. If recommendations require an academic
        program summary (APS) change, it must be submitted with the USAFA Form 68. All
USAFAI36-3523 22 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                9


      cadets on academic probation must be counseled within 10 duty days after the publication
      of the progress report.
      2.4.3.2. End of Semester. The ARC requires advisors to oversee cadets in all categories
      of academic probation in completing the USAFA Form 68 and submitting it to the ARC
      coordinator. If recommendations require an APS change, it must be submitted with the
      USAFA Form 68. All cadets on academic probation must be counseled within 10 duty
      days after the beginning of the following semester.
   2.4.4. Academically Deficient Cadet Responsibilities. Cadets on academic probation will
   complete a USAFA Form 68 according to instructions on the form and submit to the
   academic advisor or AAOCA. The USAFA Form 68 will be completed within 10 duty days
   after the publication of the mid-semester progress report, and within 10 duty days after the
   start of each new semester for end-of-semester progress reports. Exception: Cadets listed
   on an ARC interview roster must complete a USAFA Form 68 with their appeal package. If
   cadets fail to complete a USAFA Form 68 and deliver it to their academic advisor or
   AAOCA by the established deadline date, the academic advisor or AAOCA will forward the
   cadet’s name to the AOC, who will take appropriate disciplinary action.
   2.4.5. Instructor Responsibility:
      2.4.5.1. Mid-semester. The ARC requires instructors to complete Comment Cards for all
      ―C-,‖ ―D,‖ and ―F‖ grades in their courses. Comment Cards are optional for other cadets.
      2.4.5.2. End of Semester. The ARC requires instructors to complete Comment Cards for
      all their cadets listed on the ARC records review roster regardless of final grade, in
      addition to cadets with ―C-,‖ ―D,‖ and ―F‖ grades in their courses. Comment Cards are
      optional for other cadets.
      2.4.5.3. End-of-Semester ARC Interviews.           Instructors may complete letters of
      recommendation for cadets who elect to be interviewed by the ARC in appealing a
      disenrollment recommendation. A cadet’s request for a letter is not an institutional
      requirement but, instead, an instructor prerogative.
      2.4.5.4. End-of-Summer Term. The ARC requires all summer academic instructors to
      complete a Comment Card for all ―C-,‖ ―D,‖ and ―F‖ grades in their courses. The
      Comment Card will be submitted no later than two days after the last day of the summer
      term classes.
   2.4.6. Medical Staff Responsibilities. The medical representative will review the medical
   records of cadets being considered. A medical representative need not be present at
   committee meetings, but if there is significant medical information, either written or verbal
   comments need to be prepared for the committee. A negative reply to the coordinator prior
   to committee meetings is required.
   2.4.7. Athletic Representative Responsibilities. The athletic representative will review the
   athletic and physical education records of all cadets reviewed.
2.5. Academic Review Committee Procedures.
   2.5.1. Committee Process:
10                                                    USAFAI36-3523 22 FEBRUARY 2012


     2.5.1.1. The ARC reviews records of academically deficient cadets at the end-of-
     semester and/or summer term progress reports. The committee votes and makes
     recommendations for retention or disenrollment of cadets. If the cadet is a relative or
     involved socially with any voting member of the ARC that he or she would normally
     meet, the cadet must report to an unbiased ARC determined by the Vice Dean of the
     Faculty.
     2.5.1.2. During the review, all relevant information is considered. A profile or character
     sketch of the cadet is compiled using information from the instructor Comment Cards,
     formal records of counseling, military performance appraisals, athletic ratings, medical
     history, and any written statements submitted by the cadet.
     2.5.1.3. Cadets recommended for disenrollment after a records review (unless previously
     resigned) will be presented with a letter of notification from the ARC chairperson
     (electronically through the AOC) within two duty days of completion of the records
     review process. The appropriate ARC coordinator will present this notification. Each
     coordinator will brief cadets on their rights to present evidence as to why they should not
     be disenrolled and on the type of evidence considered relevant by the ARC. Cadets
     receiving such a notification have 72 hours to choose one of two options. The two
     options are:
        2.5.1.3.1. Written Statements Before and Personal Interview Before the ARC.
        Written statements may be submitted for consideration at the personal interview if
        presented to the ARC coordinator on or before the fifth day after receipt of the letter
        of notification. This is the only time cadets will be permitted to present their case
        orally and in writing. To exercise this right, cadets must appear in person before the
        ARC on the date, time, and location specified for the interview. Cadets will not be
        allowed to call witnesses to testify in person before the ARC. The cadet’s academic
        advisor or AAOCA and AOC are expected to attend the interview. As the situation
        dictates, informed alternates may stand-in.
        2.5.1.3.2. Waiver of Personal Interview and Written Statements.
     2.5.1.4. The ARC will interview cadets who elected to appeal no earlier than the sixth
     day after sending the letter of notification for academic disenrollment. After the
     interview, the ARC will vote again on whether to recommend disenrollment to the Dean
     and then to the Superintendent.
        2.5.1.4.1. For any ARC interview (those proceedings described in paragraph
        2.5.1.3.1.), the cadet meeting the ARC shall be permitted to challenge committee
        members for cause. A reasonable likelihood that the member cannot be impartial will
        constitute cause. The committee chairperson will rule on any such challenge,
        including those made against the chairperson. Should the challenge for cause be
        against the chairperson, that chairperson must consult an attorney from the
        Headquarters USAFA Staff Judge Advocate (HQ USAFA/JA) office prior to ruling
        on the challenge.
        2.5.1.4.2. The USAFA/DFRC will send an interview results notification letter to the
        AOC and Academic Advisor through CAMIS/email if cadets are retained by the Dean
USAFAI36-3523 22 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                11


         of the Faculty or Superintendent. The AOCs should immediately share the retention
         letter with the cadet and begin the academic probation process.
         2.5.1.4.3. Records of cadets recommended for disenrollment after a personal
         interview will be presented to the Dean for approval or disapproval of the ARC’s
         recommendation. If the Dean concurs with a recommendation for disenrollment, the
         ARC case file with the accompanying recommendations shall be reviewed
         by USAFA/JA and then forwarded to the Superintendent.
     2.5.1.5. Cadets disenrolled by the Superintendent will be presented a letter of notification
     from Headquarters USAFA Staff Judge Advocate Cadet Disenrollments (HQ
     USAFA/JACD).
  2.5.2. Voting. A quorum composed of at least four qualified voting ARC members must be
  present for voting on any proposed action. A majority vote by the quorum is required for all
  proposed actions before the ARC, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph. Each
  member of the committee has one vote on all recommendations brought before the
  committee. Recommendations for disenrollment or retention in each case are proposed as a
  formal motion. An open vote is taken on the motion and the details of the committee’s
  deliberations and votes for disenrollment will be given to the Dean and then the
  Superintendent, including full identification and explanation of minority and abstention votes
  on all cases required to be forwarded to them for consideration. For cadets recommended to
  the Superintendent for disenrollment, the committee will include in its findings whether the
  active duty commitment for a first or second-class cadet should be waived. The results of the
  committee meeting are confidential and will be revealed only to the Superintendent or
  Academy Board as needed.
     2.5.2.1. Retention Votes:
         2.5.2.1.1. All 5-0, 4-1, 4-0, or 3-1 ARC votes for retention are final without
         Superintendent review.
         2.5.2.1.2. The ARC chairperson will present all other votes to the Dean and
         Superintendent for final decision.
     2.5.2.2. Disenrollment:
         2.5.2.2.1. The ARC chairperson presents all ARC votes for disenrollment to the
         Superintendent for final decision.
         2.5.2.2.2. The Superintendent will make the final decision on cadets recommended
         for disenrollment by the ARC.
     2.5.2.3. Abstention Votes:
         2.5.2.3.1. Any voting member who is either an instructor, coach, otherwise required
         to submit a Comment Card, or who was disqualified from voting, and the vote will be
         recorded as an abstention. Alternate voting members will vote in place of the
         abstaining member. If more than two voting members abstain, the ARC coordinator
         will serve as a voting member.
         2.5.2.3.2. Abstention votes are included for purposes of satisfying the majority vote
         requirement. For example, a vote of two for retention, two for disenrollment, and one
12                                                  USAFAI36-3523 22 FEBRUARY 2012


        abstention would result in a recommendation for the cadet’s retention since the
        required three-vote majority was not met. Such a retention recommendation would
        be presented to the Superintendent for final decision.
        2.5.2.3.3. Other than as required in paragraph 2.5.2.3.2. above, abstention votes are
        not permitted.
  2.5.3. Observers. Members of the Academy Board, representatives from the Headquarters
  USAFA Office of Admissions (HQ USAFA/RR) and USAFA/DFR, and faculty members are
  encouraged to attend ARC meetings as observers. Any other person must obtain permission
  from the coordinator.

                                            Chapter 3

                              MILITARY REVIEW COMMITTEE

3.1. Deficient in Conduct.
   3.1.1. A cadet who is considered deficient in conduct (as defined in Attachment 1) will be
   interviewed by his or her Squadron AOC at the end of a rating cycle, or as required. The
   Squadron AOC may:
       3.1.1.1. Find the cadet proficient in conduct.
       3.1.1.2. Recommend the cadet be placed or continued on Conduct Probation.
       3.1.1.3. Refer the case to the Commandant of Cadets (USAFA/CW) via the appropriate
       Group AOC with a recommendation for potential disenrollment.
3.2. Deficient in Aptitude.
   3.2.1. A cadet who is considered deficient in aptitude (as defined in Attachment 1) will be
   interviewed by his or her Squadron AOC at the end of a rating cycle, or as required. The
   Squadron AOC may:
       3.2.1.1. Find the cadet proficient in aptitude.
       3.2.1.2. Place or continue the cadet on Aptitude Probation.
       3.2.1.3. Refer the case to the USAFA/CW via the appropriate Group AOC with a
       recommendation for potential disenrollment.
Note: A higher-level commander can request a USAFA Form O-299, AOC Evaluation of Cadet,
to recommend disenrollment action in the event the squadron AOC has determined not to pursue
a disenrollment action.
3.3. Referring Cases to the MRC. Generally, the MRC will be invoked for misconduct that
does not warrant the use of a Hearing Officer or Board of Officers. (Attachment 2 describes how
cadets deficient in conduct and/or aptitude are processed and the necessary reports to be
completed.) Cases of deficient cadets may be referred for consideration by the MRC in the
following ways:
   3.3.1. The Squadron AOC or Group AOC, after the interview described in paragraphs 3.1.1.
   and 3.3.1., may recommend the cadet’s case be considered for disenrollment by the MRC.
   The Squadron AOC will forward a recommendation for MRC consideration to the Group
   AOC on USAFA O-299, AOC Evaluation of Cadet. The Group AOC will, in turn, make a
   recommendation for convening an MRC to the Vice Commandant of Cadets
   (USAFA/CWV).
3.4. Final Decision on MRC. The USAFA/CWV will make the final decision on whether or
not a case of a deficient cadet will be considered by the MRC. USAFA Form O-299, AOC
Evaluation of Cadet, must be completed before the case is to meet the MRC.
3.5. When a Cadet is Recommended for Consideration by the MRC. The MRC recorder,
Cadet Wing Discipline (USAFA/CWVV-D) or designated agent will contact the MRC
chairperson to determine a meeting time and place and will notify all members of the MRC.
 14                                                    USAFAI36-3523 22 FEBRUARY 2012


   3.5.1. Cadets will be notified of the reasons they are meeting the MRC, their rights, and their
   options, in writing, at least 3 calendar days before the scheduled MRC meeting. The
   USAFA/CWVV-D or designated agent will also provide a copy of the Military Review
   Committee Case File to be used in the MRC to the cadet. The cadet will reply, in writing,
   acknowledging receipt and understanding of the letter. Cadets have the following three
   options:
      3.5.1.1. Waive their right to appear before the MRC. If the cadet chooses this option, the
      cadet may submit written matters to the MRC. The MRC committee will make a
      recommendation to the Superintendent, through the Commandant, based upon a review
      of the cadet’s Military Review Committee Case File.
      3.5.1.2. Resign.
      3.5.1.3. Appear before the MRC. The cadet appears before the MRC with witnesses and
      evidence.
   3.5.1.4. In all of these cases, the Superintendent may opt to convene an Academy Board as
   an additional forum for discussion.
   3.5.2. The MRC will interview those cadets who elect to appear before the committee.
   Although cadets may not appear with legal counsel, they will be permitted to make
   statements on their own behalf, submit written matters, and present up to 10 written and two
   in person character witnesses. The information must be deemed relevant to the case by the
   chair and the witnesses must be reasonably available. Cadets may be present for all
   testimony.
      3.5.2.1. For any MRC proceeding described in paragraph 3.5.1.1. or 3.5.1.3., the cadet
      meeting the MRC shall be permitted to challenge committee members for cause. A
      reasonable likelihood that the member cannot be impartial will constitute cause. The
      committee chairperson will rule on any such challenge, including those made against the
      chairperson. Should the challenge for cause be against the chairperson, that chairperson
      must consult an attorney from the HQ USAFA/JA office prior to ruling on the challenge.
   3.5.3. Following the interviews and/or discussion, the MRC will vote on a recommendation
   to the Commandant for Superintendent consideration. Normally, the MRC will make one of
   the following recommendations:
      3.5.3.1. Disenroll.
      3.5.3.2. Retain with or without probation. A recommendation for retention may specify
      administrative, remedial actions and/or terms of probation.
      3.5.3.3. Military Minus. This recommendation will be forwarded to the other standing
      committees (ARC and PERC) for consideration. Cadets whose deficiency in the ARC or
      PERC committee’s area might normally result in a vote for retention should, instead, be
      considered for disenrollment by that committee in the presence of a military minus. If the
      ARC or PERC committee recommends disenrollment, the MRC chairperson may be
      required to appear before the Superintendent or with the other committee chairperson to
      explain the reasons for the MRC recommendation.
3.6. Composition of the Military Review Committee.
USAFAI36-3523 22 FEBRUARY 2012                                                             15


   3.6.1. Voting members will be approved by the MRC chairperson and normally serve for the
   duration of their Academy tour. These members will be selected based on their familiarity
   with cadet life and active involvement in rating cadets. The MRC duties take precedence
   over other duties or scheduled activities. For this reason, voting members will attend all
   meetings unless excused by the chairperson. The five members of the MRC are:
       3.6.1.1. Vice Commandant of Cadets (USAFA/CWV) - voting member. (Alternate is
       any CW officer in the rank of Colonel, other than the USAFA/CWP.)
       3.6.1.2. One representative from USAFA/DF – voting member.
       3.6.1.3. One representative from USAFA/AD – voting member.
       3.6.1.4. Two representatives from CW – voting members.
       3.6.1.5. Recorder: The USAFA/CWVV-D or designated agent – nonvoting member.
       3.6.1.6. Legal Advisor: The USAFA/JA – nonvoting member.
*Note: All voting members will be 0-5s or above (retired or active duty). However,
experienced 0-4s may be approved by the MRC chair on a case-by-case basis.
   3.6.2. Each voting member of the MRC has one vote on all formal motions brought before
   the MRC. Decisions of the MRC are by majority vote. Any voting member may call for a
   vote by making a motion for disenrollment. If seconded, discussion will be terminated and a
   vote recorded. The chairperson may postpone a vote pending the presentation of additional
   information before the committee. Each member must vote his or her conscience and not be
   influenced by the votes of other representatives on the committee. The chairperson will
   verbally notify the respondent cadet of the results of the MRC.
   3.6.3. The USAFA/JA will designate an attorney to act as legal advisor to the MRC. The
   legal advisor will be present at all MRC meetings.
   3.6.4. Alternate MRC members are encouraged to attend meetings as observers. Academic
   advisors, coaches, and any other person interested in the MRC agenda may attend with
   permission of the chairperson. Observers, except bona fide committee members (primary or
   alternate) and Academy Board members, may not be present while deliberations are in
   progress. AOCs/AMTs will attend when their cadets are scheduled to appear before the
   committee. The chairperson can call additional members to testify if the member can present
   relevant information.
3.7. Specific Duties of MRC Members.
   3.7.1. Chairperson:
       3.7.1.1. Presides over all meetings of the MRC.

               PHYSICAL EDUCATION REVIEW COMMITTEE (PERC)

4.1. Deficiency in Physical Education.
   4.1.1. Cadets are deficient in physical education if they receive a failing grade in a physical
   education class, physical fitness test, aerobic fitness test, intramural activity, or have a
   semester or cumulative Physical Education Average (PEA) below 2.00.
   4.1.2. Athletic Probation.
       4.1.2.1. Cadets will go on athletic probation and be placed in the athletic reconditioning
       program (RECONDO) if their cumulative PEA is below 2.00.
       4.1.2.2. Cadets who fail a physical education (PE) class will be placed on academic
       probation.
       4.1.2.3. Intramural deficiencies will be directed to the PERC chairperson for appropriate
       action.
       4.1.2.4. The Fitness Testing and Evaluation Division (ADPT) will notify AOCs and
       cadets when cadets are placed on or removed from athletic probation. A complete listing
       of cadets on athletic probation will be maintained by ADPT.
4.2. The Physical Education Review Committee (PERC).
   4.2.1. The PERC may review cadets deficient in the PFT, AFT, intramural programs,
   physical education courses, or PEA. The committee may recommend what it deems
   necessary for each individual case. The most common recommendations follow, but are not
   limited to:
       4.2.1.1. Assigning counseling by the appropriate agency (AD, DF, CW).
       4.2.1.2. Requiring the cadet to repeat a PE course to better his or her PEA or to remove
       an incomplete grade.
       4.2.1.3. Evaluating and recommending the cadet for medical turn-back.
       4.2.1.4. Requiring the cadet attend a summer-term physical education program in place
       of leave.
       4.2.1.5. Removing or limiting the cadet’s extracurricular activities.
       4.2.1.6. Removing or limiting the cadet’s participation in military duties.

   decide, based on the number of cases being reviewed to convene more than one PERC board
   during a review cycle.
USAFAI36-3523 22 FEBRUARY 2012                                                               19


Note: A recommendation for an athletic minus indicates athletic deficiencies, which does not
solely warrant disenrollment itself. This recommendation will be forwarded to the other
Academy Board standing committees (MRC and ARC) for consideration. If the MRC or ARC
recommends disenrollment based partially on the athletic minus recommendation, a PERC
representative will appear before the Academy Board, if necessary with the other committee
chairperson, to explain the reasons for the PERC recommendation. Recommendations for
disenrollment or late graduation will be forwarded to the Superintendent through the Director of
Athletics (AD) and the appropriate chain of command. Medical turn-back recommendations will
be forwarded to the Commandant of Cadets (USAFA/CW) through the 10th Aerospace Medicine
Squadron Cadet Clinic (10 AMDS/SGP).
4.3. Composition of the Physical Education Review Committee.
   4.3.1. Chairperson directed by USAFA/AD – voting member.
   4.3.2. Two Athletic Department representatives (chosen by the Director of Athletic
   Programs or Deputy) – voting members.
   4.3.3. A CW representative – voting member.
   4.3.4. A representative from the Dean of Faculty – voting member.
   4.3.5. A representative of the 10th Medical Group (need not be present) – nonvoting
   member.
   4.3.6. A reconditioning program Officer in Charge (OIC) (need not be present) – nonvoting
   member.
   4.3.7. The recorder – nonvoting member.
   4.3.8. The AOC or AMT of any cadet interviewed by the committee will attend to offer any
   pertinent testimonies. The Academic Advisor is also advised to attend.
   4.3.9. Observers. Observers may attend PERC meetings with permission from the
   chairperson. Observers attending the meeting will not be allowed to speak during the
   proceedings unless the chairperson specifically requests it. No observer will be allowed to
   stay in the room during the final discussions and voting.
4.4. Physical Education Review Committee Procedures.
   4.4.1. The PERC will be convened as directed by the Director of Athletic Programs to
   consider cadets who are deficient in any aspect of the Physical Education program. The
   PERC will make appropriate recommendations to the Superintendent through the Director of
   Athletics and the appropriate chain of command. The PERC will normally meet after each
   scheduled PFT and AFT cycle. There are two types of PERCs – Review and Interview.
       4.4.1.1. PERC Review: Members review the athletic histories of athletically deficient
       cadets. The five voting members vote to decide what course of action needs to be
       followed based on the cadet’s individual history and inputs from the RECONDO OIC
       and 10 MDG. While the PERC can recommend a number of different actions, some of
       the more common outcomes are athletic probation, counseling, athletic minus, and
       disenrollment.

     4.4.1.2. PERC Interview: Cadets who elect to appeal a PERC Review disenrollment
     decision have a minimum of five working days to prepare a retention package for a
     PERC Interview. The cadet will be given written notice of his or her deficiency and
     rights. The PERC Interview will convene to hear the cadet’s appeal. The AOC or AMT
     will be present for the PERC Interview. The Academic Advisor is advised to attend. If
     the Academic Advisor cannot attend, then the advisor must submit a letter to the PERC
     Interview with their impressions of the cadet, including a recommendation for retention
     or disenrollment. The PERC votes on a course of action following the cadet’s appeal. If
     the disenrollment decision stands, the PERC chairperson will present the case to the
     Director of Athletics. If the Director of Athletics concurs, the recommendation is
     forwarded to the Superintendent through the appropriate chain of command. The
     Superintendent will make the final decision on cadets recommended for disenrollment by
     the PERC Interview.
     4.4.1.3. The PERC Interview is the cadet’s last opportunity to appeal. However, the
     chain of command from the Athletic Director through the Superintendent may request the
     cadet appear before them.
  4.4.2. Voting: A quorum composed of at least four qualified voting PERC members must be
  present for voting on any proposed action. A majority vote by the quorum (a 2-2 vote is not
  considered a majority vote) is required for all proposed actions before the PERC, except as
  otherwise provided in this paragraph. Each voting member of the committee has one vote on
  all recommendations brought before the committee. Recommendations for disenrollment or
  retention in each case are proposed as a formal motion. An open vote is taken on the motion
  and the details of the committee's deliberations and votes for disenrollment will be included
  in the PERC minutes. For cadets recommended to the Superintendent for disenrollment, the
  committee will include in its findings whether the active duty commitment for a first- or
  second-class cadet should be waived. The results of the committee meeting are confidential
  and will be revealed only to the Superintendent or Academy Board as needed. PERC
  retention votes are final and forwarded only to the Director of Athletics.
     4.4.2.1. Abstention Votes:
         4.4.2.1.1. Any voting member with a predisposition of the PERC case, the PERC
         chairperson will disqualify the individual from voting, and their vote will be recorded
         as an abstention.
         4.4.2.1.2. Abstention votes are included for purposes of satisfying the majority vote
         requirement. For example, a vote of two for retention, two for disenrollment, and one
         abstention would result in a recommendation for the cadet's retention since the
         required three-vote majority was not met.
  4.4.3. After the introduction of the PERC Interview panel, the chairperson will ask the
  appealing cadet if they have a reason to believe any voting member on the board cannot
  render a fair and objective decision. If the cadet states that a panel member may have a bias,
  then the chairperson and the cadet will discuss the alleged bias in private. After the
  discussion, the chairperson will decide if the committee member will vote or not.

4.5. PERC Preparations. Prior to convening the PERC Interview, the recorder will prepare a
list of all athletically deficient cadets arranged by deficient categories. The following
information will be provided:
   4.5.1. Athletic History Form.
   4.5.2. Minutes from the last PERC the cadet met.

4.6. PERC Scheduling. The PERC members will be notified of the scheduled meeting
approximately one week prior to the meeting.
   4.6.1. The PERC recorder will prepare and distribute an agenda to each PERC member prior
   to the meeting.

                                           Chapter 5

                   INTERCOLLEGIATE ELIGIBILITY COMMITTEE

5.1. Intercollegiate Athletics Eligibility Requirements.
   5.1.1. Eligibility for participation in intercollegiate athletics will be, as a minimum, always
   in accordance with the Constitution and bylaws of the National Collegiate Athletic
   Association (NCAA) and the rules of the Mountain West Conference (MWC) for sports
   designated as MWC sports. The NCAA and MWC eligibility standards include both
   minimum cumulative GPA criteria and satisfactory progress toward graduation.
   5.1.2. A member of an intercollegiate squad whose cumulative GPA falls below the
   following NCAA standards at the time a new semester begins becomes ineligible for
   competition until the beginning of the next semester (if he/she then meets the cumulative
   GPA requirement):

Table 5.1. NCAA Intercollegiate Eligibility GPA Requirements.

      Intercollegiate Eligibility GPA requirements (NCAA)
      Beginning of Semester              Cumulative GPA
         3                                       1.80
         4                                       1.80
         5                                       1.90
         6                                       1.90
         7 and subsequent semesters              2.00
   5.1.3. In addition to the minimum NCAA requirements in the Table 5.1., a cadet athlete also
   becomes ineligible for competition when he/she enters a new semester and fails to meet
   USAFA standards (below). A cadet athlete will be declared ineligible for any of the
   following circumstances:
       5.1.3.1. Multiple ―F‖ grades.
       5.1.3.2. An ―F‖ grade in a repeat course.
       5.1.3.3. Cumulative MPA or cumulative PEA below 1.5.
       5.1.3.4. Majors GPA below 2.0 during first-class year.
   5.1.4. At the beginning of a semester, only the Superintendent (through the Academy Board)
   may approve waivers to the USAFA standards. Eligibility committees may approve waivers
   to USAFA standards at mid-semester, but may never approve waivers to the NCAA
   requirements listed in Table 5.1.
5.2. Composition of the Intercollegiate Eligibility Committees.
   5.2.1. The eligibility committees will be composed of the following individuals:
       5.2.1.1. USAFA/DF representative (voting member and committee chairperson).
       5.2.1.2. The coach (voting member).
USAFAI36-3523 22 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                 23


       5.2.1.3. A CW representative (voting member).
       5.2.1.4. The Officer Representative (OR). The OR will serve as a nonvoting recorder for
       the committee and will monitor the grades of all cadets on the team roster.
       5.2.1.5. The committee chairperson will be a field grade officer (or above) or civilian
       equivalent.
   5.2.2. The Athletics Liaison office (USAFA/ADPL) will provide a list of members of each
   eligibility committee to USAFA/DFR, USAFA/CWVV, and to the NCAA Faculty Athletics
   Representative (FAR).
5.3. Procedures for Eligibility Committees.
   5.3.1. When, at mid-semester progress report or end-of-semester final grades, a cadet athlete
   is placed on academic probation, his/her status as a member of an intercollegiate team will be
   determined by an eligibility committee for the appropriate sport. In addition to the cases
   required to be reviewed under paragraph 5.3.3., a cadet athlete placed on athletic, conduct,
   and/or aptitude probation may be reviewed by the eligibility committee at the request of CW
   or the Athletic Director.
   5.3.2. The eligibility committees for intercollegiate sports will determine a proper course of
   action for a cadet who is deficient in any way. The committee’s objective goes beyond just
   ensuring the cadet meets minimum NCAA and MWC academic requirements. The
   committee is tasked with providing guidance and, if needed, restrictions on cadets to ensure
   they are on a path leading towards graduation and commissioning. A committee may merely
   warn the cadet, restrict attendance at practices, recommend extra instruction, or declare the
   cadet temporarily ineligible to participate in trips or contests. When a committee finds that a
   cadet is not making progress to complete the semester with a minimum cumulative GPA and
   with passing grades in all subjects, or not making progress toward removing his/her military
   or athletic probation, the committee may declare the cadet ineligible to participate in
   intercollegiate activities for the remainder of the semester. A cadet declared ineligible may
   be retained on the team and allowed to practice only (not compete in contests).
   5.3.3. Eligibility committees will meet within two weeks after the start of classes each
   semester and within two weeks following the publication of the progress report at each mid-
   semester to make decisions in academic, athletic, conduct, and aptitude probation cases
   resulting from:
       5.3.3.1. Single or multiple ―F‖ grades.
       5.3.3.2. Incomplete grades involving extenuating circumstances.
       5.3.3.3. Deficient semester or cumulative GPAs, PEAs and/or MPAs.
       5.3.3.4. Major GPA below 2.00 (first-class cadets only).
   5.3.4. Each eligibility committee will record minutes of its proceedings and send copies to
   the FAR, USAFA/DFR, USAFA/ADPL, USAFA/ADWC, and USAFA /CWVV. If no team
   members are deficient, a negative report must be submitted.
   5.3.5. Actions taken by the eligibility committees are completely separate from those actions
   taken by the ARCs; however, the eligibility committees will keep the FAR informed of their
24                                                   USAFAI36-3523 22 FEBRUARY 2012


  actions. The FAR, in turn, will inform the ARC chairpersons of eligibility committee actions
  (if necessary).

                 SUMMER TRAINING REVIEW COMMITTEE (STRC)

6.1. Deficiency in Summer Training.
   6.1.1. The STRC meets to examine cadet summer training deficiencies. Cadets are deficient
   in summer training when they have a grade of Controllable Incomplete (IC), Uncontrollable
   Incomplete (IU), Failed (F), Withdraw (W), Withdraw Passing (WP), or Withdraw Failure
   (WF) in one or more summer training programs.
6.2. Types of STRCs.
   6.2.1. There are two basic types of STRCs. They are a Review (paper records review) and
   an Interview (full board type). The STRC Review is convened when the training deficiency
   does not affect the cadet’s graduation date. If the training deficiency affects the graduation
   date, because it cannot be made up, then a STRC Interview must be convened.
   6.2.2. A STRC Review is conducted by the Chief of Training (USAFA/CWTT).
   6.2.3. A STRC Interview is chaired by the Directorate of Training Support (USAFA/CWT),
   the Deputy Director, or the BCT/CC for Basic Cadets. Board composition is detailed in
   paragraph 6.5.3. of this publication.
6.3. Basic Cadet Review STRC and Responsibilities.
   6.3.1. This STRC is held independently from the normal STRC Review in August.
   Following the basic cadets’ return from Jacks Valley and prior to the Acceptance Parade, any
   basic cadet who did not meet the pass/fail criteria for Basic Cadet Training (BCT) will meet
   this STRC. The BCT/CC will determine if this will be a review or interview. Review
   procedures are spelled out in paragraph 6.4. of this publication. Interview procedures are the
   same for the Basic Cadet Review (BCR) STRC as for any other STRC that is convened. The
   only difference is that BCR STRCs happen so quickly that there is not time to provide pre-
   briefs for board members. Interview procedures are spelled out in paragraph 6.5. of this
   publication.
      6.3.1.1. The recorder will: Obtain records and memoranda concerning the case for
      presentation at the STRC meeting. Contact the chairperson to determine a meeting time
      and place and notify all members of the STRC with this information. Ensure the AOC
      and training cadre are available during the meeting to provide information.
      6.3.1.2. The STRC will make one of the following recommendations:
          6.3.1.2.1. Retain.
          6.3.1.2.2. Disenroll.
      6.3.1.3. Basic cadets will be notified of the decision of the STRC by the chairperson at
      the conclusion of the meeting. Cadets recommended for disenrollment have the
      following options:
          6.3.1.3.1. Accept the recommendation. A disenrollment recommendation will be
          forwarded to the Commandant by the chairperson.
 26                                                    USAFAI36-3523 22 FEBRUARY 2012


          6.3.1.3.2. Resign.
          6.3.1.3.3. Appeal to a reconvened STRC. The basic cadet appears before the STRC
          with character references and evidence as prescribed in paragraphs 6.3.1.4. and
          6.3.1.5. of this publication.
      6.3.1.4. Basic cadets who appeal to the STRC will be provided with a prebrief letter.
      Notification will be prepared by the recorder and delivered immediately following the
      STRC. The prebrief letter will specify the time and place of the reconvened STRC
      meeting and the reasons the basic cadet is being recommended for disenrollment. The
      basic cadet will acknowledge receipt and understanding of the letter, in writing, to
      USAFA/CWT.
      6.3.1.5. The STRC will interview those cadets who elect to appeal. Although cadets may
      not appear with legal counsel, they will be permitted to make statements on their own
      behalf, submit written matters, and present character references at the discretion of the
      chairperson. The information presented by the cadet must be relevant to the case at hand.
      The STRC proceedings will not be delayed due to nonavailability of character references.
      6.3.1.6. Following the interviews and/or discussion, the STRC will vote to retain or
      disenroll. A disenrollment recommendation will be forwarded to the Superintendent.
      6.3.1.7. As before, the basic cadet will be notified of the recommendation by the
      recorder, in writing, approximately three duty days after the conclusion of the STRC.
6.4. STRC Review and Responsibilities.
   6.4.1. The STRC Review, which meets in August, will take final action on cadets deficient
   in summer training whose graduation dates are not affected.
   6.4.2. Approximately three weeks after the completion of the summer training, the STRC
   Review will be conducted by USAFA/CWTT. This STRC will conduct a records review of
   those first, second, and third-class cadets who are deficient in summer military training.
      6.4.2.1. Using the criteria in paragraph 6.1.1., the recorder, NCOIC of Summer Programs
      Scheduling, will identify those cadets who are deficient in summer military training.
      6.4.2.2. The recorder will contact the chairperson to determine a meeting time and place
      and if necessary, notify all members of the STRC, including the legal and medical
      advisors.
      6.4.2.3. The USAFA/CWTT will conduct a records review of those cases meeting the
      training deficiency criteria.
      6.4.2.4. The STRC may:
          6.4.2.4.1. Waive the training requirement.
          6.4.2.4.2. Require the cadet to complete the training the following summer.
          6.4.2.4.3. Recommend to the Group AOC that the cadet be placed on Conduct and/or
          Aptitude Probation during which the cadet will undergo a specified period of
          evaluation. If the cadet violates the probation before its expiration, the STRC may re-
          consider the case for referral to the Superintendent or Academy Board.
USAFAI36-3523 22 FEBRUARY 2012                                                              27


          6.4.2.4.4. Refer a case directly to a STRC Interview. Note: Any cases, which
          impact the graduation date of a cadet, must be referred to a STRC Interview.
      6.4.2.5. Cadets will be notified, in writing, of the results of the STRC Review and their
      options by the Summer Programs Scheduling Office (USAFA/CWTSS). Cadets have the
      following options:
          6.4.2.5.1. Accept the decision.
          6.4.2.5.2. Resign.
          6.4.2.5.3. Appeal. The cadet will appear before a STRC Interview with character
          references and evidence as prescribed in paragraphs 6.5.1. of this publication.
6.5. STRC Interview Procedures, Responsibilities and Composition.
   6.5.1. Cadets who appeal to the STRC will be provided with a prebrief letter. Notification
   will be prepared by the recorder and/or scheduling flight and delivered through the AOC at
   least three workdays prior to the reconvened STRC. The prebrief letter will specify the time
   and place of the STRC Interview and the reasons for the STRC’s decision. The cadet will
   reply, in writing, acknowledging receipt and understanding of the letter. The STRC will
   interview those cadets who elect to appeal. Although cadets may not appear with legal
   counsel, they will be permitted to make statements on their own behalf, submit written
   matters, and present character references at the discretion of the chairperson. The
   information presented by the cadet must be relevant to the case at hand. The STRC
   proceedings will not be delayed due to non-availability of character references.
   6.5.2. The STRC Interview (board interview) is normally convened in September:
      6.5.2.1. Approximately three weeks after the STRC Review, the STRC Interview will
      convene. The STRC will interview cadets who appealed the decision of the STRC
      Review.
   6.5.3. Board Composition: The seven members of the STRC Interview are as follows:
      6.5.3.1. Chairperson: USAFA/CWT, or the BCT/CC – voting member. (Alternate:

           TURNBACK AND CONDITIONAL TURNBACK STATUS POLICY

7.1. General. At any time, the Academy Board may direct cadets with weak academic records
be turned back immediately as an alternative to disenrollment. They are not expected to graduate
on time with their class unless they significantly improve their academic performance. An ARC
may recommend a cadet to be a conditional turnback. Cadets in turnback or conditional turnback
status will graduate and be commissioned as soon as administratively possible upon meeting all
graduation requirements. Establishment of turnback or conditional turnback status is effective
upon approval by the Academy Board. The ARC recorder will notify cadets of their placement
on turnback status for academic reasons.
7.2. Turnback. Cadets turned back to the next succeeding class rather than placed in
conditional turnback status are generally turned back for minor medical or administrative reasons
because they have missed a large amount of instruction and have virtually no chance to graduate
with their class (see USAFAI 36-2007, Application for and Administration of Cadet Turnback
Program). At the end of the calendar year in which a conditional turnback’s class has graduated,
the cadet who still has not met graduation requirements may be turned back to the next
succeeding class. At that time, the Academy Board may designate any one or two semesters to
be deleted in future computations of the cadet’s cumulative quality points and GPA.
7.3. Conditional Turnback Status. Cadets in conditional turnback status will be scheduled for
a divisional major, carry only five courses each semester, and remain at the Academy for at least
nine semesters. They may be permitted to take six courses when their cumulative or semester
GPA at the end of the preceding semester with five or more courses is greater than or equal to
2.40. They may be permitted to take seven courses if at the end of a preceding semester with at
least six courses, their cumulative or semester GPA is greater than or equal to 2.60. However, a
cadet must download to five courses if he or she is deficient on a mid-semester progress report.
Cadets who are able to meet the requirements of a disciplinary academic major while following
the above guidelines may petition the ARC chairperson to declare and graduate with that major
within the nine semesters. The chairperson will then present the cadet’s petition to the Academy
Board for approval. Cadets may petition the ARC chairperson to be removed from conditional
turnback status when they are no longer academically deficient and they can meet graduation
requirements by the end of a summer academic term through normal loads and reasonable
summer course work. These petitions should be prepared with the assistance of the cadet’s
advisor and contain a specific detailed recommendation for an academic program that will lead
to fulfilling graduation requirements. The ARC chairperson or the Dean may deny a cadet’s
request for removal from conditional turnback status. However, if the request is approved, it is
forwarded to the Academy Board for a final decision. All decisions on petitions for removal
from conditional turnback status will be forwarded to USAFA/DFRR for inclusion in the cadet’s
file.
7.4. Monitoring Conditional Turnbacks. The academic advisor will monitor the progress of
all cadets in conditional turnback status to ensure compliance with the provisions of this
instruction. At each progress report, the academic advisor will make necessary changes to the
academic load of all turnbacks and cadets in conditional turnback status. At the end of the fall
semester, the ARC will make an appropriate recommendation to the Academy Board in the case
USAFAI36-3523 22 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                31


of any cadet in conditional turnback status that has completed nine semesters of academics and
has not yet met graduation requirements.
7.5. Summer Training. The summer training schedule for cadets in academic difficulty,
especially those in conditional turnback status, will be formulated by USAFA/CWTS in
coordination with USAFA/DF. Cadets in academic difficulty may volunteer to give up their
leave and take a summer academic course in an effort to improve their academic status. Cadets
returning from medical or administrative turnback status or prior cadets being readmitted will be
reviewed by USAFA/CWTS in coordination with USAFA/DFR, Headquarters USAFA Cadet
Personnel (HQ USAFA/A1A), and USAFA/DFRR to determine summer training requirements
and projected return dates. The USAFA/A1A will send letters notifying cadets of their return
date.

                            DISENROLLMENT PROCEDURES

8.1. Disenrollment of Cadets. Cadets with deficiencies will be processed for disenrollment in
accordance with the provisions of AFI 36-2020, Disenrollment of United States Air Force
Academy Cadets.
8.2. Notification Procedures. Disenrolled cadets will be notified, in writing, by
HQ USAFA/JACD. The HQ USAFA/JACD counsels all disenrollees on their rights and
options.
8.3. Legal Reexamination (Title 10, United States Code U. S.C. 9351, Cadets: deficiencies
in conduct or studies; effect of failure on successor). Any disenrolled cadet who is deficient
only because of failure to pass a required examination in any one subject is entitled to a
reexamination of equal scope and difficulty in that subject, provided both his or her semester and
cumulative GPAs are more than or equal to 2.00 for all courses exclusive of the one failed. The
cadet must apply in writing to Headquarter USAFA Registrar's Office (USAFA/DFRC).
   8.3.1. The Secretary of the Academy Board or the Registrar will notify cadets of their
   entitlement to reexamination, in writing.
   8.3.2. An ARC coordinator must counsel cadets entitled to a reexamination concerning their
   Title 10 rights. Cadets will designate, in writing, whether they wish to take the
   reexamination within ten days of their receipt of the official written notification of
   disenrollment. Cadets who apply will not be outprocessed until the results of the
   reexamination are known. The reexamination will be prepared, administered, and graded by
   the department offering the failed course within five duty days of the department’s
   notification of the cadet’s request. The five duty days do not include weekend days, federal
   holidays, periods of authorized emergency leave, or days where the cadet is admitted as an
   inpatient in a hospital. Cadets awaiting reexamination will not be sent Temporary Duty
   (TDY). The reexamination will be of comparable scope and difficulty to the final
   examination in the failed course. Departments will notify USAFA/DFRC, in writing, of the
   cadet’s final examination grade for placement in the cadet’s official records.
   8.3.3. The department concerned will notify USAFA/DFRC by telephone of the date, time,
   and location of the reexamination.
   8.3.4. Cadets will prepare for their reexamination primarily through individual study. They
   will not be allowed to attend regularly scheduled classes in the course they failed.
   8.3.5. If disenrollment occurs at the end of the fall semester or at the end of the third summer
   term, the cadet will attend all academic and military formations while awaiting
   reexamination.
   8.3.6. If disenrollment occurs at the end of the spring semester, the cadet will take the
   reexamination in lieu of leave.
   8.3.7. Cadets who successfully pass a reexamination will be formally readmitted to the
   Cadet Wing. The original ―F‖ grade will remain on the transcript, and the cadet will be
   placed on academic probation until successful completion of the failed course if the course is
USAFAI36-3523 22 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                     33


   a core course or major’s requirement. If the course is an elective course or the cadet changes
   major, the duration of the academic probation is until the next progress report.
   8.3.8. Cadets who fail a reexamination are not authorized to take another reexamination.
8.4. Participation in Final Examinations.
   8.4.1. Cadets who plan to resign at the end of a semester and elect to take final examinations
   will receive letter grades and may be disenrolled for academic deficiency in lieu of voluntary
   resignation if they are deficient in studies at the final grade report. To avoid the possibility of
   academic disenrollment, a cadet must resign and be officially removed from all classes prior
   to the start of final examinations.
   8.4.2. Cadets notified of the Superintendent’s approval of or recommendation for
   disenrollment before the end of the last day of classes in a semester or term will not be
   allowed to take finals and will receive no credit for that semester or term. Grades of ―WP‖ or
   ―WF‖ will be awarded. If, however, all course work is completed and no final examination
   is required nor any project remains ungraded the grade earned will be awarded.
   8.4.3. Cadets notified of the Superintendent’s approval of or recommendation for
   disenrollment after the start of final examinations for a semester or term may complete all
   final examinations and will receive all credit earned.

9.1. Disenrollment Case File. HQ USAFA/JACD will forward the disenrollment case file to
the Secretary of the Air Force for approval in appropriate cases. The case file will include a
recommendation from the Superintendent. The Superintendent will recommend the type of
separation and whether any active duty commitment should be waived.
9.2. DD Form 785, Record of Disenrollment from Officer Candidate-Type
Training. HQ USAFA/JACD will prepare a DD Form 785 on any cadet pending disenrollment.
9.3. DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty. When a cadet is
discharged from the Air Force or transferred to another component, HQ USAFA/A1A will issue

Terms
Academic Probation—The status of a cadet who is deficient in established academic
performance standards.
Academic Review Committee (ARC)—A standing committee of the Academy Board
responsible for making disenrollment recommendations to the Superintendent on cadets deficient
in studies. At the end of each semester/term, the ARC reviews the cases of cadets with deficient
grade point averages (GPAs), recommends rehabilitative actions for those voted for retention,
interviews cadets initially recommended for disenrollment, and takes disenrollment
recommendations to the Superintendent for final approval. The Office of Primary Responsibility
(OPR) for records of ARC meetings and actions is the USAFA/DFR.
ARC Review—Any cadet whose academic record meets any one of the following criteria listed
below is considered to be seriously deficient in academics and is automatically placed on
USAFAI36-3523 22 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                   37


academic probation. The ARC at a record review will determine whether the cadet should be
recommended for disenrollment to the Superintendent, or for any other appropriate action.
Multiple Failures—More than one ―F‖ grade in majors, core, and/or elective courses.
Multiple Probation—Deficient in academics and aptitude, conduct, and/or athletic performance.
Repeated Cum Deficiency—Failure to achieve a 2.00 semester GPA in 3 sequential semesters.
Repeat Failure—Second failure (―F‖ grade) in the same course, whether core/core substitute,
major, or elective course regardless of the number of semester hours. Regardless of the outcome
of the ARC vote, the records of cadets in the repeat failure category will be presented to the
Superintendent for final decision.
Multiple Deficient Semesters—Two sequential semesters of either deficient semester and/or
cumulative GPA.
Single “F”—An ―F‖ grade in core, major, or elective course.
Automatic Review—An automatic review will be conducted on a select number of cadets who
were previously considered for disenrollment.
Cadet Information Card (Electronic Comment Card)—Information provided by the
instructor on a cadet taking his or her course to provide a written picture of the cadet’s classroom
performance both academically and militarily. The ARC and Superintendent use this
information to determine the cadet’s potential to graduate from USAFA and be commissioned
into the US Air Force. When ARCs are in session, this information may be obtained by
contacting the Registrar Office (USAFA/DFR); otherwise, this information may be obtained by
contacting the appropriate academic department.
Conditional Turnback Status—The status of cadets who have experienced academic
difficulties and will probably not graduate on time with their class. Cadets will remain in
conditional turnback status until they graduate. If they fail to meet graduation requirements by
the end of the calendar year in which their original class has graduated, the Academy Board may
transfer them to the next succeeding class; they will then be designated as turnbacks.
Deficient in Academics (Academic Probation)—A cadet is deficient in studies at mid-semester
report or the end of a semester/summer term when the cadet has one or more of the following:
——A grade of ―F‖ or a controllable ―I‖ in any course, whether graded or pass/fail, required for
graduation or commissioning. This includes majors or elective courses, military art and science
courses, physical education, and Aviation courses.
——Cumulative or semester GPA less than 2.00.
——Major GPA less than 2.00 in the first-class year.
GPA—The numeric average achieved by cadets in graded courses. The semester GPA is
determined by dividing all quality points earned during a semester/term by the semester hours
attempted. The cumulative GPA is determined by dividing all quality points earned during all
semesters/terms by the total of all the semester/term hours attempted. A maximum of 12
semester hours of repeat courses may be used to replace original ―F‖ grades in the computation
of the cumulative GPA. Quality points are earned per semester hour based on the following:

Incomplete—An interim grade of ―I‖ signifies that course requirements have not been
completed for the particular course.

      Controllable ―I‖ Grade—Willful failure to complete required course assignment.

      Uncontrollable ―I‖—Given when course requirements have not been met due to incapacity,
sickness, or emergency beyond the control of the cadet.

Underloaded Third Class Cadets—Academically deficient third class cadets who have not
carried six course units in either the third class fall or spring semesters.

Weekend Academic Call to Quarters (WACQ)—WACQs are weekend study periods of 60
minutes duration assigned to cadets (first class cadets exempt) to improve their academic
performance. WACQs are assigned by the AOC with the assistance of the CADO for the
remainder of the semester as follows: one automatic WACQ for being on academic probation
plus one for each ―C-―, two for each ―D,‖ and three for each ―F‖ grade. Additional WACQs may
be assigned by the academic advisor, up to a maximum of 15 per weekend. Cadets may select
the specific period on the weekend to serve their WACQs. Logging of WACQs in the squadron
is the responsibility of the cadet. WACQs may be served at the same time as confinements, but
in that case will be served in the cadet’s room unless the cadet’s AOC authorizes otherwise.
Cadets in good standing may serve WACQs anywhere. Cadets on academic probation will serve
according to the following limitations:

—Third and fourth-class cadets will serve in their rooms or at the library.

—Second class cadets may serve at their sponsor’s, academic advisor’s, AOC’s, or instructor’s
house as well as in their rooms or the library.

—Any cadets away on athletic trips may serve WACQs wherever they can as time allows.
USAFAI36-3523 22 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                    39



Athletic Probation—The status of a cadet who is deficient in any physical education program as
determined by the Athletic Director or the PERC. Athletic probation involves closer monitoring
of the cadet’s performance in physical education programs and directed remedial efforts.

Deficient in Athletics—A cadet is deficient in athletics by failing the PFT, the AFT, or if the
cadet’s semester or cumulative PEA is below 2.0 grade in a physical education course,
intramural activity.

Eligibility Committees—A group of officers and civilians who meet at least twice each
semester to review the proficiency of intercollegiate cadet athletes. Every USAFA/AD
sponsored intercollegiate athletic team is required to have an eligibility committee. USAFA/AD
or its designee serves as the OPR for records of eligibility committee actions. See Chapter 5.

Physical Education Review Committee (PERC)—A standing committee of the Academy
Board. The committee evaluates cadets deficient in the physical education program and makes
recommendations to the Athletic Director and the Superintendent. USAFA/ADP or its designee
serves as the OPR for records of PERC meetings and actions.

Genera Academic, Athletic, or Military Minus—A determination by the appropriate Academy
Board subcommittee that a cadet’s performance in a particular area is marginal but not so
inadequate as to warrant disenrollment. Another subcommittee may, if it finds that the cadet’s
performance in a second area of performance is also marginal, but not so inadequate as to
warrant disenrollment, recommend the cadet for disenrollment based upon marginal performance
in two or more areas. Minus recommendations must be forwarded to the other standing
committees of the Academy Board (ARC, PERC, and MRC) and considered under their
deliberations.

Deficient Cadet—A cadet who fails to meet the required standards in conduct, integrity,
training, athletic or academic proficiency, or aptitude for commissioned service.

Disenrollment—Termination of cadet status. Disenrollment does not in itself end other military
obligations (AFI36-2020).

Honor Probation—The status of a cadet who has violated the USAFA Honor Code by lying,
stealing, cheating, or tolerating the same and, therefore, has caused his or her commissionability
to be severely questioned, but who has been retained at the Academy by having the
disenrollment recommendation suspended for six months. Honor probation allows a cadet an
opportunity to learn and again prove him or herself and be reinstated into the Cadet Wing in
good standing.

Progress Reports—Academic, athletic, and military grades and performance averages published
each mid-semester, end of semester, and end of third summer term.

Turnback Status—The status of cadets who have been assigned to the next succeeding class,
due to administrative, medical, or academic reasons.

Military Aptitude for Commissioned Service—The personality, capacity, and inclination
(either natural or acquired) to adapt to military relationships, customs, and responsibilities
traditional and necessary in the military service; and the strength of character and willingness to
accept limits on freedom of individual action the traditional structure and legal status of military
service impose upon its members.

Aptitude Probation—The status of a cadet whose pattern of performance and/or consistent
inability to meet Cadet Wing standards raises doubt concerning his or her aptitude for
commissioned service as determined by the USAFA/CC, his or her designee, or the MRC.
Failure to successfully complete this process will normally result in the convening of the MRC.
The minimum period of Aptitude Probation is three months.

Conduct—A cadet’s adherence to or departure from civilian laws, as well as Air Force and
Academy directives and standards. The cadet disciplinary system identifies, corrects, and where
appropriate, attempts to rehabilitate cadets whose conduct fails to meet standards.

Conduct Probation—The status of a cadet whose conduct raises doubt concerning his or her
qualification to remain a cadet as determined by the CW/CC, his or her designee, or the MRC.
This type of probation is conduct-specific and is normally tied to behavior documented via
UCMJ actions (Art 15), Administrative Actions (Letters of Reprimand (LOR), Letters of
Admonishment (LOA), Letters of Counseling (LOC), and Record of Counseling (AF Form
174), and for cadets in all classes AFCW Form 10, Report of Conduct. Failure to
successfully complete the process will normally result in the convening of the MRC. The
minimum period of conduct probation is three months.

Deficient in Aptitude—Cadets are deficient in aptitude when they have a BCT, cumulative,
semester, or special (out-of-cycle, not included in Cumulative MPA) MPA of less than 2.00, or if
they receive a deficient AOC rating. A deficient AOC rating is an AOC rating of less than 2.0.

Deficient in Conduct—Cadets are deficient in conduct if they:

—Exhibit a pattern of misconduct that demonstrates an unwillingness and/or inability to adapt to
the standards expected of officer candidates.

—Receive Article 15 punishment or are convicted by a court-martial.

—Are found by a hearing officer or board under AFI36-2020 to have engaged in conduct
authorizing disenrollment under that instruction.

—Cadet has exceeded the career demerit total of 200 demerits.

Discharge—A complete severance from military status, active or otherwise (AFI 36-2020).

Military Performance Appraisal (MPA)—The rating received by a cadet from an end of
semester or Summer Leadership Program military performance evaluations. The cumulative
USAFAI36-3523 22 FEBRUARY 2012                                                               41


MPA is the average of previous semester and summer MPAs. Summer Leadership Program
MPAs are a chain of command evaluation of military performance. Semester MPAs are awarded
by the Squadron AOC, Group AOC, CWT/CC, USAFA/AD coaches, 306 FTG squadron
commanders, OICs, and/or NCOICs after consideration of information from instructors, coaches,
OIC, the primary rater, additional rater, Leadership Attribute Survey (LAS), and Professional
Development Program (PDP) scores. All cadets will be evaluated by their direct supervisor and
an additional rater with the AOC, Group AOC, or CWT/CC determining the final MPA rating.
The MPA is based on a 4.0 rating scale, with a 4.0 being the best and 0.0 being the worst. A 2.0
represents the minimum standard of acceptable performance. An MPA rating below 2.0 is a
deficient evaluation and is subject to review as required by this or other USAFA directives.

Military Review Committee (MRC)—A standing committee of the Academy Board that makes
recommendations for commissioned service on cadets deficient in conduct and/or aptitude. The
MRC reviews the cases of cadets with a deficient MPA interviews selected cadets, recommends
rehabilitative actions to the Commandant of Cadets, and with the approval of the Commandant
of Cadets makes recommendations to the Superintendent concerning aptitude for commissioning.
USAFA/CWV or its designee serves as the OPR for records of MRC actions.

Summer Training Review Committee (STRC)—A standing committee of the Academy
Board. At the end of each summer training period, the STRC will review fourth, third, second,
and first class cadets deficient in the completion of pass or fail summer training programs. The
committee will take final action on cadets deficient in summer training whose graduation date is
not affected, or make recommendations to the Superintendent on cases where the graduation date
could be delayed, or make recommendations to the Superintendent, with the approval of the
Commandant of Cadets, for disenrollment. CWT, or its designee serves as the OPR for records
of STRC meetings and actions.
