   1.7. 76 AMXG MOC and 552 MOC, when notified by BEF, will broadcast via radio the
   Heat Condition.
2. Outdoor Guidelines:
   2.1. Monitoring and Notification of Outdoor WBGT Index:
       2.1.1. WBGT is monitored by BEF during the months of May through September.
       Extended monitoring will be based on seasonal variations.
       2.1.2. On weekdays with a forecasted ambient temperature of 85°F or greater, BEF will
       monitor the WBGT Index and corresponding Heat Condition at least every two hours
       from 1000 to 1600.
       2.1.3. When the WBGT Index reaches 85°F, the WBGT Index will be monitored at least
       hourly by BEF until the WBGT Index drops below 85°F or until 1600, M-F.
       2.1.4. WBGT Index notification will be made every time the Heat Condition changes
       while above 85°F.
       2.1.5. BEF will make WBGT Index notifications to Tinker Command Post, 76 AMXG
       MOC, and 552 MOC. Upon notification from BEF, 76 AMXG MOC and 552 MOC will
       disseminate Heat Condition information via radio broadcast.
       2.1.6. Heat Conditions will be posted on the plasma screens located throughout the OC-
       ALC facilities.
       2.1.7. The WBGT Index can be found at any time by going to the Tinker Homepage,
       https://wwwmil.tinker.af.mil, and clicking the “HEAT CONDITION” icon to see the
       WBGT Index and Heat Condition and associated work/rest cycles (see Attachment 3).
       2.1.8. Contact BEF on-call personnel, through the Tinker Command Post, with any
       questions or concerns after 1600, M-F, and during weekends.
   2.2. Supervisors or designated representative (i.e. Unit Safety Representative (USR),
   Voluntary Safety Representatives (VSR)) will:
 4                                                        TINKERAFBI48-101 20 JUNE 2013


        2.2.1. When the forecasted temperature is greater than 85°F, brief affected employees on
        the Heat Condition notification procedures, techniques for prevention of heat-related
        illness, and reporting procedures for cases of suspected heat illness at the start of each
        shift. Training materials are available from Public Health.
        2.2.2. Implement all Heat Condition Advisories as published by BEF to include
        work/rest cycles.
        2.2.3. Ensure employees take breaks in a shaded or cooled area to the maximum extent
        possible.
        2.2.4. Ensure potable water is available for employee consumption.
     2.3. Wear of overly bulky and restrictive clothing (e.g., chemical warfare defense ground
     crew ensemble: CWDE) places an added heat stress burden on individuals. If personnel are
     wearing CWDE or other heavy, restrictive clothing (e.g., impermeable coveralls), a
     correction factor must be added to a reported WBGT Index to account for added
     physiological stress. See Attachment 2 for guidance.
3. Indoor Guidelines:
     3.1. Supervisors with employees working in “High Risk” areas, with assistance from VSR
     (if applicable) will:
        3.1.1. Identify “High Risk” areas. “High Risk” areas are unconditioned (non-air
        conditioned) areas in industrial areas. Buildings that contain areas that may be “High
        Risk” include, but are not limited to: 230, 240, 260, 2122, 2121, 2136, 2211, 3102, 3105,
        3234, 3703, and 3705.
        3.1.2. Brief affected personnel, when the forecasted temperature is greater than 85°F, on
        Heat Condition notification procedures, heat stress prevention techniques and reporting
        procedures for cases of suspected heat illness at the start of each shift.
        3.1.3. Ensure potable water is readily available for employee consumption.
        3.1.4. Perform wellness check of indoor employees every two hours when Heat
        Condition four (Red Flag) is reached outdoors to ensure personnel are given the
        opportunity to take a hydration/cooling break as needed.
        3.1.5. Perform wellness checks of indoor employees every hour when Heat Condition
        five (Black Flag) is reached outdoors to ensure personnel are given the opportunity to
        take a hydration/cooling break as needed.
        3.1.6. Implement outdoor procedures as described in paragraph 2.1 for interior facilities
        affected by direct solar load (e.g. western facing hangars with open hangar doors).
     3.2. Non-Industrial Areas. Since administrative workers are considered unacclimated,
     special consideration should be given to those areas where administrative employees are
     exposed to high heat due to temporary HVAC limitations. In conjunction with Employee
     Relations, supervisors and commanders should determine if accommodations are necessary
     to ensure the safety and well-being of affected employees. If accommodations are necessary,
     supervisors will implement the “High Risk” guidelines as described in paragraph 3.1.
TINKERAFBI48-101 20 JUNE 2013                                                                 5


4. Guidelines for Occupational Heat Exposures:
   4.1. Personnel who routinely perform their jobs while exposed to hot environments (such as
   aircraft maintenance, ground maintenance, and repair work in steam pits and tunnels) are
   occupationally exposed. Occupational exposures to thermal stress are evaluated during
   Occupational Environmental Health (OEH) surveillance (i.e., Industrial Hygiene Surveys) by
   BEF. BEF survey reports are posted in the work centers for 10 days and available to all
   workers.
   4.2. Supervisors of occupationally exposed personnel should use Attachment 2 to plan work
   and rest cycles for individuals under their control per AFPAM 48-151, Thermal Injury.
   When the WBGT Index reaches the temperatures shown in the attachment for the category of
   workload, supervisors should initiate work/rest cycles. Work load descriptions are located in
   Attachment 1.
   4.3. During normal duty hours, all related questions will be directed to BEF. After duty
   hours, inquiries will be directed to the BEF technician on-call via the Tinker Command Post.
   4.4. In case of emergency, dial 911.
5. Supervisor/Individual Considerations. Ability to adjust and tolerate heat varies with the
individual. Some of these factors are:
   5.1. Acclimatization (body’s ability to adjust to heat stress)
   5.2. Duration of exposure
   5.3. Amount of work to be performed
   5.4. Air movement and humidity
   5.5. Type of clothing worn
   5.6. Physical fitness
6. Prevention of Heat Stress Illness or Injury:
   6.1. Acclimatization. This is of the utmost importance for new arrivals from cooler climates.
   This process takes 10 to 14 days and is directly related to the heat stress imposed on the
   individual. A period of acclimatization is required for all personnel regardless of each
   individual’s physical condition. An individual is considered acclimatized if he or she has
   undertaken regular exercise for longer than 10 days in the same environmental conditions as
   the proposed activity.
   6.2. Encourage Water Intake. Commanders and supervisors are responsible for ensuring
   water is available. Do not use thirst as an index of how much to drink; drink more than you
   think you might need. Small amounts of water (one pint every hour) are encouraged during
   periods of moderate activity when exposed to hot temperatures. Milk and coffee do not make
   up for water loss. Carbonated beverages, while containing water, are not effective in keeping
   the body hydrated.

    6.3. Obtain adequate rest before physical exertion.
    6.4. Avoid strenuous exercise during hottest hours.
    6.5. Wear loose clothing to permit the passage of air.

Acclimatization—A period of adjustment an individual’s body requires to become accustomed
to working in hot environments. Full acclimatization occurs through progressive degrees of heat
exposure and physical exertion. Personnel may need two weeks of increasing exposure to
become substantially acclimated and may retain most of their adaptation for about one-week
after leaving a hot climate. Workers in good physical condition acclimatize more quickly.

Heat Stress—Heat stress is the combination of environmental and physical work factors that
constitute the total heat load imposed on the body. The environmental heat stress factors are air
temperature, radiant heat exchange (example, sunlight), air movement, and relative humidity.
Physical work contributes to total heat stress through the body’s production of heat (metabolic
heat) as it burns energy to sustain the work. This production of metabolic heat depends on the
intensity of the physical effort, which is affected, in turn, by body size, muscular developments,
physical fitness, and age.
Light (Easy) Work—Light work would correspond to sitting with moderate arm and leg
movements, standing with light work at machine or bench, using a table saw, or standing with
light or moderate work at machine or bench and some walking about. Military applications
would include walking on hard surfaces at 2.5 mph with <30 lb load, weapons maintenance,
manual of arms, tower operations, pilot ground activities, marksmanship training, and drill/
ceremony.
Moderate Work—Moderate work would correspond to scrubbing in a standing position, or
walking about with moderate lifting and pushing. Military applications would include walking
on hard surface at 3.5 mph with <40 lb load, walking on loose sand at 2.5 mph with no load,
patrolling, refueling, low crawl, high crawl, defensive position construction, and field assaults.
Heavy (Hard) Work—Heavy work would correspond to carpenter sawing by hand, shoveling
sand, heavy assembly work, or intermittent heavy lifting with pushing or pulling (pick and
shovel work). Military applications would include walking on hard surface at 3.5 mph with >40
lb load, and walking on loose sand at 2.5 mph with load, armament crew, heavy aircraft repair,
and Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) reconnaissance.
Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) Index—The WBGT Index is a combination of
temperature measurements which consider dry air temperature, relative humidity, and radiant
heating. The equation for the WBGT Index uses dry bulb (DB) temperatures, natural wet bulb
(NWB) temperatures, and globe (GT) temperatures.
