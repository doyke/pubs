             C-130 DEBRIEFING CHECKLIST


                       INTRODUCTION



  This debriefing checklist will be used in conjunction with T.O.
  1C-130H-2-00FR-00-1- to assist the maintenance debriefer in
  ensuring all pertinent information on each system malfunction
  is included on the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance
  Discrepancy and Work Document. The checklist is not
  intended to replace systems knowledge or common sense. The
  debriefer is charged with the responsibility of questioning the
  aircrew to make sure that all symptoms of a malfunction are
  known and recorded on the AFTO Form 781A. Remember this
  is the only information the technician will have to determine the
  source of the problem.
  Forward recommended changes to this form through channels
  to HQ AMC/A4M.
I.    Instructions: Prior to debriefing:
      A. The debriefing team members will review past
         debriefing forms, logs, or files to acquaint
         themselves with any previous repeat/recurring
         discrepancies.
      B. The appropriate maintenance specialty should
         be represented at the debriefing to help clarify
         discrepancies.

II.   Debriefing Procedures.
      A. The debriefing team leader will take charge of
         the debriefing and debrief the aircrew, utilizing
         this checklist as a guide.
      B. Review all AFTO Form 781A for the
         mission(s). Make special note of repeated or
         recurring discrepancies.
      C. Debrief all discrepancies as clearly as possible.
      D. Check adequacy of corrective action on all
         cleared discrepancies. If necessary consult with
         the on-duty pro super and specialist to validate
         questionable corrective actions. This should be
         the responsibility of the SMO, Maintenance
         Superintendent, Pro-Super, Expeditor, and lead
         technicians, not the debriefer.
      E. Using the questions in this checklist, and T.O.
         1C-130H-2-00FR-00-1, ensure all open
         descriptions of the discrepancies are as complete
         and comprehensive as possible.
      F. Determine if aircraft was flown low level over
         salt water and act as necessary to comply with
         T.O. 1-1-691, Aircraft Weapon System
         Cleaning and Corrosion Control.
      G. Ensure ALL locations where the aircraft stopped
         and was chemically disinfected for Foot and
     Mouth Disease, that an entry is made in the
     781A’s. Debriefers will document this
     information in G081, using screen 9051, with
     work unit code 02400 to create the Foot and
     Mouth Decontamination discrepancy; G081 will
     automatically enter this information in the
     aircraft history. Report this information
     electronically to HQ AMC/A4MJS; DSN 779-
     2622 ./ Commercial 618-229-2622. Due to the
     potentially damaging long-term effects of the
     decontamination on sensitive aircraft parts,
     accurate tracking is essential.
H. Determine if aircraft was flown through predicted
   areas of low volcanic ash, an entry is made in the
   781A’s. Debriefers will document this
   information in GO81 using screen XXXX, with
   work unit code XXXX to create the volcanic ash
   discrepancy; G081 will automatically enter this
   information in the aircraft history.
