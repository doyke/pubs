SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision incorporates Interim Change IC 2002-1 (Attachment 3). It incorporates changes made to
DoD Directive 5035.1 (7 May 1999), Combined Federal Campaign (CFC), Fund-Raising Within the
Department of Defense and DoD Instruction 5035.5 (12 October 1999), DoD Combined Federal Cam-
paign - Overseas Area (CFC-O), and updates them in the Purpose Statement. It adds DoD 5500.7-R, Joint
Ethics Regulation, authorized by DoD Directive 5500.7 (30 August 1993) to the Purpose Statement as a
new reference (Purpose Statement and Attachment 1, Section A - References). This change updates
addresses/office symbols (paragraphs 6.; 6.5.; 7.; 7.1.; 13.1.6.; 13.2.7.; 27.1.; and 27.2.). It aligns Air
Force campaign goals apportionment and prohibitions with DoD (paragraph 13.1.2.). It adds Joint Ethics
and DoD recommendations for keeping fundraising honest and aboveboard (paragraphs 13.2.1. and
13.2.3.). It removes previous restrictions against conducting promotional/special events in support of the
CFC and provides guidance on how these events must be conducted (paragraph 15.2.2.). It updates DoD
references governing payroll allotments for the CFC (paragraph 17.6.4.). It provides new DoD guidance
and some examples for the use of appropriated funds to support fundraising campaigns (Table 1., column
C and note 1) and adds reference to the Joint Ethics Regulation for determining when command sponsor-
ship (official endorsement) is appropriate for fundraising events (Table 1., column D, note 7 - added). It
changes the title of paragraph 19. and Table 1., column D from command sponsorship to official endorse-
ment and allows commanders to officially endorse internal fundraising falling under rules 3 and 4. Para-
graph 19. also spells out the Joint Ethics Regulation requirements for official endorsement. It eliminates
the Table 1., note 5 prohibition against external private organizations participating in both the CFC and
additional solicitations on base but away from the workplace. It removes similar dual Solicitation restric-
tions from the AFAF affiliates (paragraph 29.). It updates examples of authorized campaign aids and adds
electronic communications (Attachment 1, Section C). See the last attachment of the publication, IC
2002-1, for the complete IC. A bar ( | ) indicates revision from the previous edition.

dents) when approved by the installation commander, after consultation with an ethics official.

   accounting or program administration.

NOTES:

   1. Includes use of Federal funds, materials, or duty time to support fundraising. The use of appropri-
      ated funds is limited to expenses related to appointing project officers, using duty time for solici-
      tation or organizational meetings, using office space, office equipment/materials, kick-off
      functions, rallies, victory events, award ceremonies and other similar events that build support for
      the campaign but are not directly involved in fundraising (such as carnivals, car washes and sport-
      ing events). The use of appropriated funds for refreshments, personal gifts, or any other item or
      activity that is not essential to support the campaign is not authorized. For the DoD CFC Overseas
      Program, this authority extends to the use of installation-level CFC administrative and logistical
      support, and the use of military aircraft to transport CFC materials on a “space available” basis.
   2. These are solicitations conducted by organizations that are directed exclusively at their members.
      Only Air Force members may conduct internal fundraising activities (for example, solicitations,
      special events, and benefits), and these funds must exclusively benefit Air Force members. This
      restriction also applies to internal private organizations governed by AFI 34-223 or would be if
      their assets exceeded the minimums listed in AFI 34-223.
   3. For example, a squadron special event or benefit food sale for the unit Christmas party or a collec-
      tion to assist fellow employees in need.
16                                                                              AFI36-3101 12 JULY 2002


     4. Typical examples: benefit sales by base scout troops, athletic teams, or youth activities; and spe-
        cial events or benefits conducted by private, social, or professional organizations associated with
        the installation and composed primarily of DoD employees. To be eligible for official support and
        endorsement, the fundraising must be conducted by DoD employees, among DoD employees, for
        the benefit of DoD employees. Examples include (but are not limited to) spouses’ clubs, organiza-
        tion booster clubs, base-charted scouting organizations, Company Grade Officers’ Association,
        Non-Commissioned Officers’ Association, and so on. If the fundraising will benefit external or
        “outside” interests, follow Rule 5, Footnote 5.
     5. Typical examples: seasonal, traditional, or unique human care projects; fundraising drives for
        local, regional or national external charities or civil relief organizations and charitable collections
        to aid nonmilitary members of the local community, and so on.
     6. Commanders can publicize off-base fundraising activities, requests for volunteers, and so on in
        daily bulletins, base radio or television stations, or on bulletin boards. Commanders must not dis-
        criminate among organizations. During the CFC or AFAF, don't publicize any organizations.
     7. See referenced DoD 5500.7-R, Section 3-210.a. for guidance.

             IC 2002-1 TO AFI 36-3101, FUNDRAISING WITHIN THE AIR FORCE


12 JULY 2002


SUMMARY OF REVISIONS


This revision incorporates Interim Change IC 2002-1 (Attachment 3). It incorporates changes made to
DoD Directive 5035.1 (7 May 1999), Combined Federal Campaign (CFC), Fund-Raising Within the
Department of Defense and DoD Instruction 5035.5 (12 October 1999), DoD Combined Federal Cam-
paign - Overseas Area (CFC-O), and updates them in the Purpose Statement. It adds DoD 5500.7-R, Joint
Ethics Regulation, authorized by DoD Directive 5500.7 (30 August 1993) to the Purpose Statement as a
new reference (Purpose Statement and Attachment 1, Section A - References). This change updates
addresses/office symbols (paragraphs 6.; 6.5.; 7.; 7.1.; 13.1.6.; 13.2.7.; 27.1.; and 27.2.). It aligns Air
Force campaign goals apportionment and prohibitions with DoD (paragraph 13.1.2.). It adds Joint Ethics
and DoD recommendations for keeping fundraising honest and aboveboard (paragraphs 13.2.1. and
13.2.3.). It removes previous restrictions against conducting promotional/special events in support of the
CFC and provides guidance on how these events must be conducted (paragraph 15.2.2.). It updates DoD
references governing payroll allotments for the CFC (paragraph 17.6.4.). It provides new DoD guidance
and some examples for the use of appropriated funds to support fundraising campaigns (Table 1., column
C and note 1) and adds reference to the Joint Ethics Regulation for determining when command sponsor-
ship (official endorsement) is appropriate for fundraising events (Table 1., column D, note 7 - added). It
changes the title of paragraph 19. and Table 1., column D from command sponsorship to official endorse-
ment and allows commanders to officially endorse internal fundraising falling under rules 3 and 4. Para-
graph 19. also spells out the Joint Ethics Regulation requirements for official endorsement. It eliminates
the Table 1., note 5 prohibition against external private organizations participating in both the CFC and
additional solicitations on base but away from the workplace. It removes similar dual Solicitation restric-
tions from the AFAF affiliates (paragraph 29.). It updates examples of authorized campaign aids and adds
electronic communications (Attachment 1, Section C). See the last attachment of the publication, IC
2002-1, for the complete IC. A bar (/) indicates revision from the previous edition.

6. HQ Air Force Personnel Center, Directorate of Operations, Field Activities Division (HQ AFPC/
DPSF):


6.5.7. Announces the annual AFAF campaign to retirees, in conjunction with HQ Air Force Personnel
Center, Directorate of Personnel Program Management, Retiree and Transition Division (HQ AFPC/
DPPT), and prints a retiree pay deduction authorization form in the retiree newsletter before the start of
the campaign.


7.1. Communicate between HQ AFPC/DPSFM and the IPO.


11. The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS). Oversees the fiscal responsibilities and payroll
allotment program of the Air Force fundraising programs, per DFAS-DE 7073.2-M, JUMPS Unit Proce-
dures.


13.1.2. Support campaign goals. An overall campaign goal may be announced to encourage voluntary
participation through voluntary contributions by all Air Force personnel. Dollar goals may be established
for installations/activities and units. The installation goal may be divided equitably among activities and
units that are large enough to provide confidentiality to individual unit members. The following are pro-
hibited:


13.1.2.1. Setting 100 percent participation goals.


13.1.2.2. Establishing individual dollar goals, individual quotas or individual assessments.


13.1.6. Send requests for extensions to the AFAF campaign through the host MAJCOM DP to HQ AFPC/
DPSFM for approval.
24                                                                          AFI36-3101 12 JULY 2002



13.2.1. Ensure contributions to fund drives are truly voluntary and that each contributor can give confi-
dentially without fear of censure or criticism. No employee may be coerced in any way to participate or
contribute to the campaign. The Directives listed in Attachment 1, Section A, contain additional instruc-
tions on how to ensure that contributions are truly voluntary.


13.2.3. Ensure that any gaming devices or games of chance used in the AFAF, CFC or internal fundraising
comply with Federal, state, and local laws, and the referenced DoD 5500.7-R.


13.2.6. Resolve local complaints about fundraising practices according to AFI 90-301, Inspector General
Complaints.


13.2.7. Request an OSI investigation according to AFI 90-301 when contributions have disappeared. Send
the investigating officer's report through channels to your MAJCOM/FOA/DRU and HQ AFPC/DPSFM.


15.2.2. Get key persons to solicit employees at duty locations. Project officers may also conduct innova-
tive promotional events and activities such as car washes, carnivals, bake sales, or athletic events during
the campaign period if approved by the appropriate agency head and the events are consistent with agency
ethics regulations (maintained by the installation Staff Judge Advocate). For these approved special fund-
raising events, the project officers must do one of the following: allow donors to designate their money to
any of the local CFC organizations or Federations published in the local CFC brochure, or advise all
donors that their donation will be counted as an “undesignated contribution.” Conducting a special event
for a specific organization or charity must be avoided.


17.6.4. Accept CFC allotments from active duty and civilian Air Force members, including Guard or
Reserve members and civilian employees. See Financial Management Regulations; DoD 7000.14-R, Vol-
ume 7A, Military Pay Policy and Procedures Active Duty and Reserve Pay, and DoD 7000.14-R, Volume
8, Civilian Pay Policy and Procedures, that govern allotments.


19. Official Endorsement. Under DoD 5500.7-R, Section 3-210.a., Air Force employees may not offi-
cially endorse, or appear to endorse, fundraising for any non-Federal entity except for those specifically
identified in JER Section 3-210.a. That section permits official support and endorsement of the CFC and
AFAF. Under Section 3-210.a.(6), officials may also officially endorse and support fundraising activities
when conducted by organizations composed primarily of DoD employees (or their dependents) when
fundraising among their own members for the benefit of welfare funds for their own members (or depen-
dents) when approved by the installation commander, after consultation with an ethics official.


21. Using Official Mail and Base Information Transfer System (BITS). Fundraising personnel use official
mail and BITS to administer the CFC and AFAF campaigns in accordance with DoD 4526.6-M/Air Force
Supplement 1, Military Post Office Operating Procedures.
AFI36-3101 12 JULY 2002                                                                               25



27.2. Budget Report. Each AFAF affiliate must send a copy of the approved annual budget to HQ AFPC/
DPSFM and SAF/FMP within 30 days of its approval and before the start of the fiscal year. This report is
not subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review because it collects information from nine
or fewer members of the public.


27.4. AFAF Affiliate Annual Financial Report. AFAF affiliates prepare this report. It is not subject to
Office of Management and Budget review under The Paperwork Reduction Act because it collects infor-
mation from nine or fewer members of the public. This annual report describes the affiliate's accomplish-
ments and provides a detailed accounting of revenues and expenditures. It accounts for AFAF
contributions received during the fiscal year. Include the AFAF Contributions Accountability Report
using the format shown in figure 1. Send the report to HQ AFPC/DPSF and SAF/FMP within 30 days of
the end of your fiscal year. The Air Force Team (working level) reviews the reports for compliance.


28. Annual Audit. AFAF affiliates hire an independent certified public accountant to conduct an annual
audit. Provide a copy of the audit, including auditor and management comments, to HQ AFPC/DPSFM
and SAF/FMP no later than 90 days after the end of the affiliate's fiscal year.


29. Dual Solicitation. Affiliates may not take part in the AFAF Campaign if they receive funds from the
CFC. Organizations benefiting from solicitations at the workplace (AFAF or CFC) may conduct addi-
tional solicitations on base but away from the workplace with approval of the Installation Commander in
accordance with Table 1., rules 4 and 5.

NOTES:


1. Includes use of Federal funds, materials, or duty time to support fundraising. The use of appropriated
funds is limited to expenses related to appointing project officers, using duty time for solicitation or orga-
nizational meetings, using office space, office equipment/materials, kick-off functions, rallies, victory
events, award ceremonies and other similar events that build support for the campaign but are not directly
involved in fundraising (such as carnivals, car washes and sporting events). The use of appropriated funds
for refreshments, personal gifts, or any other item or activity that is not essential to support the campaign
is not authorized. For the DoD CFC Overseas Program, this authority extends to the use of installa-
tion-level CFC administrative and logistical support, and the use of military aircraft to transport CFC
materials on a “space available” basis.


2. These are solicitations conducted by organizations that are directed exclusively at their members. Only
Air Force members may conduct internal fundraising activities (for example, solicitations, special events,
and benefits), and these funds must exclusively benefit Air Force members. This restriction also applies to
internal private organizations governed by AFI 34-223 or would be if their assets exceeded the minimums
listed in AFI 34-223.
28                                                                             AFI36-3101 12 JULY 2002



3. For example, a squadron special event or benefit food sale for the unit Christmas party or a collection
to assist fellow employees in need.


4. Typical examples: benefit sales by base scout troops, athletic teams, or youth activities; and special
events or benefits conducted by private, social, or professional organizations associated with the installa-
tion and composed primarily of DoD employees. To be eligible for official support and endorsement, the
fundraising must be conducted by DoD employees, among DoD employees, for the benefit of DoD
employees. Examples include (but are not limited to) spouses’ clubs, organization booster clubs,
base-charted scouting organizations, Company Grade Officers’ Association, Non-Commissioned Offic-
ers’ Association, and so on. If the fundraising will benefit external or “outside” interests, follow Rule 5,
Footnote 5.


5. Typical examples: seasonal, traditional, or unique human care projects; fundraising drives for local,
regional or national external charities or civil relief organizations and charitable collections to aid nonmil-
itary members of the local community, and so on.


6. Commanders can publicize off-base fundraising activities, requests for volunteers, and so on in daily
bulletins, base radio or television stations, or on bulletin boards. Commanders must not discriminate
among organizations. During the CFC or AFAF, don't publicize any organizations.


7. See referenced DoD 5500.7-R, Section 3-210.a. for guidance.

Affiliate Organizations-Organizations authorized to receive funds from the Air Force Assistance Fund
(AFAF). AFAF is the umbrella organization for these nonprofit, tax-exempt, charitable organizations
(listed in paragraph 13.) that benefit Air Force military personnel and their families.


Air Force Assistance Fund Campaign-The AFAF campaign is an authorized on-the-job annual solicita-
tion of Air Force members (active duty military, non-extended active duty Reservists, and Air National
Guardsmen) through host command channels. Air Force civilian personnel who want to give, may do so.


Campaign Aids-Publicity items that make the CFC and AFAF campaigns more effective. Authorized
campaign aids include:
   • Balloons.
   • Lapel pins.
   • Posters.
   • Goal thermometers or displays showing achievement by organization.
   • Campaign progress reports, charts and analyses of campaign progress.
   • Endorsement or kick-off memoranda or letters.
   • News stories and articles for military installation publications or local newspapers.
   • Speeches and public appearances.
   • Recognition awards given to individuals for outstanding service to the campaign or for
      contributions based on a percentage of salary donated. (EXAMPLE: presentation of the CFC
      Eagle Award pin to recipients.)
   • Automated/electronic communication/marketing to widely promote the campaign.


Air Force Team-AF/CC appoints the incumbents from the following positions: Deputy Chief of Staff
(DCS), Personnel (team chief); DCS Logistics and Engineering; Comptroller of the Air Force; The Judge
Advocate General; Surgeon General; Office of Public Affairs, to provide advisory and consultative ser-
vices to the AFAF-affiliated retiree homes for the benefit of the Air Force and the welfare needs of its peo-
ple. The action officer representatives of the above offices form the Working Team that maintains regular
and recurring contact with the retirement homes.


Capital Funds-Contributions from fundraising campaigns conducted by charitable organizations that
provide the financial base or capital for major property or program additions.


Combined Federal Campaign (CFC)-The CFC is an authorized on-the-job annual solicitation of active
duty military personnel and civilian employees of the Air Force.


Designation-Individual contributions earmarked by a contributor for a particular organization.

Dual Solicitation-Soliciting funds for one organization from the same audience within a given fundrais-
ing cycle.


Local Federal Coordinating Committee (LFCC)-Within the CONUS, OPM establishes an LFCC at
each geographical CFC location. It governs the local CFC and contracts a Principal Combined Fund
Organization (PCFO) to administer it. Commanders or IPOs frequently chair or serve as a member of the
LFCC.


Membership Drives for Private Organizations-An activity by a private organization to solicit members
who will derive a substantial direct, private benefit in return for an established fee. Benefits may include
the use of an organization's recreational, consulting, and other facilities and services or the right to enjoy
professional standing or some other honor. Membership drives are not fundraising events and are not gov-
erned by this instruction.


Off-the-Job Fundraising Solicitation-The solicitation of Air Force personnel away from their work-
place including their quarters on a military installation, and entrances, lobbies, or concourses of buildings,
to raise funds.


On-the-Job Fundraising Solicitation-The personal solicitation of Air Force military or civilian person-
nel by designated key persons at their workplace or duty station for the support of eligible private volun-
tary organizations. Air Force personnel may conduct on-the-job fundraising solicitations at the
workplace, using federal resources, during duty time or in their official capacities, on or off duty.


Seasonal, Traditional, and Unique Human-Care Projects-These projects vary from installation to
installation. You may support them through off-the-job solicitations, special events, and benefits. They
include certain fundraising activities such as the use of "Poppies” by veterans' organizations, or food or
toy collections from boxes in public areas of Federal buildings, or installations, when approved by the
commander or heads of field installations or activities.


Solicitation-A request for money.


Special Events and Benefits-Commander-approved fundraising efforts organized to support worthy
causes and to return something of value to participants. The item of "value" can represent consideration
for a payment or contribution to the sponsoring organization over and above costs and expenses.


Suggested Giving Guides-Amounts that reasonably relate to the campaign goal, presented in terms of
percentage of annual income, number of hours' pay, or tabular form showing the suggested size of the gift
for various levels of income.
AFI36-3101 12 JULY 2002                                                                                   33


Voluntary Organizations-Private, nonprofit, tax-exempt, charitable organizations that provide specific
health, welfare, or recreational service functions or that provide international services consistent with the
policies of the US government. They are self-governing organizations financed primarily by contributions
from the general public and do not receive appropriated funds from the US Air Force. This term describes
agencies receiving money from the annual CFC.


Youth Activities Programs-On-base morale and recreational programs that support the morale of parents
by providing a year-round program that improves and maintains the physical and mental well-being of
their youth in accordance with AFI 34-801.
