This MESL compliments AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status, and Utilization Reporting.
It applies to all ACC E-4B units. This addendum does not apply to Air National Guard (ANG)
or Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units and members. Ensure that all records created as a
result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force
Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air
Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule
(RDS) located at http://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm Send recommended

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. E-4B Pre
Mod Block 1 table was removed. E-4B MESL Qualifying Notes updated for pilot proficiency
front end training only.

1. General. The MESL is the basis of status reporting IAW AFI 21-103. MESLs lay the
ground work for reporting the status of aircraft availability. They list the minimum essential
systems and subsystems that must work on an aircraft for it to perform specifically assigned unit
wartime, training, test, or other missions. Mission Ready Available (MRA) is used in readiness
SORTS reporting only and denotes MC aircraft capable of being configured for a contingency
mission in accordance with COMACC OMNIBUS Plan.
     1.1. Qualifying notes are used to define aircraft exceptions and help explain complex
     degraded mission systems such as communications equipment.
     1.2. Aircraft status for generation and deployment: The goal is to generate or deploy FMC
     aircraft, recognizing status actually achieved may be less than FMC. A Not Mission Capable
     (NMC) aircraft may be deployed provided it is safe for flight and can be configured and
     generated to MRA status at an employment site.
     1.3. All ACC units will generate, or deploy and regenerate, using ACC MESLs. Major
     Command differences in MESLs are acknowledged. Upon actual deployment to another
     MAJCOM theater, the gaining MAJCOM has the responsibility to resource and specify the
     unit’s requirements and resource the differences in support/mission equipment.
2. Reading the MESL. A MESL is read by comparing the systems stated by work unit code
(WUC) against the FSL and all applicable BSLs across the page. Each unit’s Design Operational
Capability (DOC) statement determines applicability of BSL columns. The aircraft MESLs
incorporate all ACC assigned aircraft and therefore it is important to compare only those
columns listed in the MESL which are applicable to the unit’s assigned aircraft. For example,
units with CC (wartime) coded aircraft will determine and report status using only the FSL and
BSL columns related to their DOC statement. Units with TF (training) coded aircraft will
determine and report status only using the FSL and TNG columns, and units with CB (test) code
aircraft will determine and report status using only the FSL and TST columns. Units with
multiple code aircraft will ensure status is reported using the MESL columns appropriate to the
individual aircraft assignment code.
