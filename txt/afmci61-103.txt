Directors and AFMC Center Commanders to support each of the five major study boards. This
publication does not apply to the Air National Guard (ANG) and the Air Force Reserve
Command (AFRC) and their units.

1. Role of the AFMC External Study Boards Process.
   1.1. The primary objective of the external study board process is to provide AFMC’s highest
   priority strategic study requirements to external study boards. Secondary objectives include
   minimizing workload, eliminating redundant study requirements and providing feedback to
   study submitters on the adjudication of their submission.
 2                                                                  AFMCI61-103 27 JUNE 2013


     1.2. Definition of Major Study Boards:
        1.2.1. Air Force Studies Board (AFSB) – The AFSB serves as a convening authority for
        the discussion of a wide-range of strategic level topics related to defense, intelligence,
        national security, space, and aerospace. In collaboration with Air Force leadership, the
        board develops studies related to the development and application of science and
        technology to be carried out by the National Research Council. The AFSB study
        selection and prioritization of topics are managed by SAF/AQR.
        1.2.2. Air Force Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) – The SAB is a Federal Advisory
        Committee that provides independent advice on matters of critical science and
        technology issues/challenges relevant to current and near-term AF needs, and
        maintaining our ‘technical dominance’ of air, space and cyberspace. The SAB study and
        selection process is managed by the Secretary and Chief of Staff of the Air Force.
        1.2.3. RAND Project Air Force (PAF) – PAF’s mission is to conduct an integrated
        program of objective analysis on issues of enduring concern to Air Force leaders by
        addressing far-reaching and interrelated questions. HAF/A8 manages and allocates
        studies to RAND.
        1.2.4. Air University (AU) – AU conducts independent research, outreach and
        engagement that contribute ideas for enhancing national security and assuring the
        continuing effectiveness of the USAF. AU solicits, manages, and provides AU
        researchers with topics useful to decision makers and those representing sponsors’ needs.
        1.2.5. Defense Science Board (DSB) – The DSB is chartered to provide independent
        advice and recommendations on matters relating to the DoD scientific and technical
        enterprise in order to develop and strengthen the department's research and development
        strategies for the 21st Century. The DSB works with the Secretary of Defense, the Under
        Secretary of Defense Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD (AT&L)), and the
        Department of Defense Research and Engineering Enterprise.
     1.3. The process will also provide study topics for consideration by HQ AFMC/A9, whose
     mission is to conduct rigorous, critical, and objective analysis to inform the decisions of the
     AFMC Commander and Agile Combat Support Core Function Lead Integrator. More
     information on each board can be found on the HQ AFMC/A9 SharePoint site:
     https://org.eis.afmc.af.mil/sites/HQAFMCA89/A9A/AFMC%20Study%20Topics/Forms
     /AllItems.aspx. The information can be found on the study board description tab located
     within the AFMC Proposed Study Topics spreadsheet.
2. Responsibilities.
     2.1. AFMC/CA
        2.1.1. Solicits topics from HQ AFMC Directors and AFMC Center Commanders for all
        five major boards and HQ AFMC/A9 study consideration.
     2.2. HQ AFMC Directors and AFMC Center Commanders.
        2.2.1. Reviews previously conducted and requested studies.
        2.2.2. Identifies and prioritizes new strategic study topics.
        2.2.3. Submits topics annually to HQ AFMC/A9 by last Friday in January.
AFMCI61-103 27 JUNE 2013                                                                      3


   2.3. HQ AFMC/A9
      2.3.1. Collates and prioritizes proposed topics based on level of interest, direct impact,
      probability of study success, and alignment with study boards.
      2.3.2. Vets proposed prioritized topic lists through HQ AFMC 2-ltrs for AFMC/CC
      approval.
      2.3.3. Maintains Master Study List on SharePoint, records/identifies received and
      approved topics.
3. How the AFMC External Study Boards Process Works.
   3.1. Each year in mid-December, AFMC/CA will issue a strategic study topics data call, via
   e-mail and SOCCER, to all HQ AFMC Directors and AFMC Center Commanders. The
   purpose of the call is to gather AFMC strategic study requirements. Study topics are due to
   HQ AFMC/A9 by the last Friday in January. The study topic requirements will be submitted
   in accordance with a template developed by HQ AFMC/A9 which will include study title,
   description, submitter, and general officer sponsor.
   3.2. Study submitters will review previously conducted and requested studies to inform the
   identification of new study requirements. They will also prioritize their study requests and
   identify the preferred study board to conduct the study.
   3.3. HQ AFMC/A9 will collate and prioritize the topics pertaining to each of the five major
   study boards. HQ AFMC/A9 will select the top topics for each of the study boards, and vet
   them through the AFMC 2 letter directorates and AFRL Chief Technologist for coordination.
   After HQ AFMC/A9 topic selection and AFMC Directors and AFMC Center Commanders
   coordination, HQ AFMC/A9 will prepare and staff the package for AFMC/CC approval. HQ
   AFMC/A9 will also facilitate the submission of the study topics to the points of contact for
   the study boards. Once topics are submitted, the decision to accept/conduct a study resides
   with the board and/or their AF points of contact.
   3.4. Below is a more specific breakout of timeline and process for each study board:
      3.4.1. The AFSB call occurs annually during the January/February time frame. HQ
      AFMC/A9 facilitates the submission of the AFSB topics approved by AFMC/CC to
      AFSB and SAF/AQR. SAF/AQR prioritizes, selects and gives direction on topics
      selected for AFSB study.
      3.4.2. The SAB call occurs annually during the February/March time frame. HQ
      AFMC/A9 facilitates the submission of the SAB topics approved by AFMC/CC to the
      SAB. SAB selects the “finalists” from topics submitted from across the AF. AFMC-
      related “finalist” topics are prioritized and staffed for AFMC/CC approval. HQ
      AFMC/A9 facilitates the final submission back to the SAB, who typically selects 3-5
      topics from across the AF.
      3.4.3. RAND’s call for topics occurs annually during the April/May timeframe. HQ
      AFMC/A9 facilitates the submission of the RAND topics approved by AFMC/CC to
      RAND. RAND works directly with AFMC General Officers to refine the list. RAND
      submits a revised list of topics to HQ AFMC/A9, who prioritizes the list. The prioritized
      topics are sent to AFMC 2 letter directorates for coordination then to AFMC/CC for
      approval. Once approved, the list is forwarded to AF/A8X who works with all
4                                                                   AFMCI61-103 27 JUNE 2013


       MAJCOMs to develop an integrated priority list for the AF. AF/A8 also facilitates
       prioritization deliberations for the RAND PAF Working Group and Steering Group, with
       the latter being chaired by VCSAF.
       3.4.4. The AU call for topics occurs during the May/June time frame. HQ AFMC/A9
       facilitates the submission of all topics, not already selected, that fit into one of the six AU
       tracks. The six tracks include profession of arms, military studies, international security
       studies, leadership studies, communication studies, and warfare studies. The topics are
       sent to graduate students assigned to AU for review and selection of topics of interest.
       Upon completion of the student’s study, the student submits the completed paper to the
       organization requesting the study. Once the AFMC organization receives the research
       paper, the organization will provide feedback of the usefulness of the results to AU.
       3.4.5. The DSB call is more sporadic, and it typically does not occur annually. When it
       does occur, HQ AFMC/A9 facilitates the submission of the DSB topics approved by
       AFMC/CC to the DSB.
    3.5. HQ AFMC/A9 will maintain a master study list on the HQ AFMC/A9 SharePoint
    website,                                      located                                        at
    https://org.eis.afmc.af.mil/sites/HQAFMCA89/A9A/AFMC%20Study%20Topics/Forms
    /AllItems.aspx, identifying all submitted topics and the results of their adjudication through
    AFMC staffing and AFMC/CC approval.
