                                            Chapter 1

                                       INTRODUCTION

1.1. Purpose. This instruction establishes the Department of the Air Force Civilian Police and
Security Guard (DAF CP/SG) Program. The DAF CP/SG program is an integral part of Law and
Order (L&O) operations, a core function of the Air Force Security Forces (SF). The term Law
and Order operations as used in this document refers to the Law and Order Program defined in
AFPD 31-1 and in the terms section of this document. In the "0080" series, the parenthetical of
"law enforcement" in the title designates the position as being a police position versus an
information protection or other like position. This document also assigns responsibilities and
establishes policy, standards and procedures for the effective implementation of the program. It
describes and outlines standard policies and procedures for selecting, hiring, training and
equipping DAF CP/SG. Exception: The daily work environment of senior staff level 0083 series
SF employees does not require response to law enforcement emergency incidents or situations;
they are not armed and do not wear a uniform or a badge. As staff officers, they do not enforce
the law and are not exposed to work situations that ever require use of force, firearms, strenuous
physical activity, exertion or agility. Accordingly, the requirements of this instruction pertaining
to physical agility testing, weapons qualification, wear of the uniform, medical evaluation and
job compatibility assessment apply to these staff employees only if specifically required by their
position description. Senior staff level 0083 series SF employees are defined as those who work
at Group Headquarters, Numbered Air Force (NAF) Headquarters, Major Command (MAJCOM)
Headquarters, Field Operating Agencies (FOA) and Headquarters Air Force (HAF). Disputes
regarding identification/classification of these employees may be forwarded to AF/A7SD for
resolution. Senior staff level 0083 series SF employees who may deploy to an area of combat
must comply with requirements of the deployed location. SF units will adhere to the
requirements of respective Collective Bargaining Agreements (CBA), to include local level
impact and implementation which take precedence over this AFI and supplements to this AFI
created at any level. In instances where CBA obligations deviate from established AFI standards,
commanders will ensure future drafts of binding agreements comply with this AFI and
supplement(s). It is the AF’s intent to build a program that is limited to Civilian Police Officers,
GS-0083, which provide increased capability and effectiveness. To meet this intent, all new unit
manning document (UMD) positions should be designated as GS-0083 series. Units will convert
existing Security Guard GS-0085 positions to Police Officer GS-0083 positions at the earliest
opportunity. The use of GS-0083-12 and above SCPDs must be validated by CFM/FM before
they are used to ensure appropriate and balanced integration of these positions into SF units. A
unit organizational chart denoting the position and a justification must be submitted to CFM/FM
for validation.

                                 SELECTION AND HIRING

2.1. Basic Character Traits/Qualities. Civilian police officers and security guards will display
the basic character traits of honesty, courtesy, tact, cooperation, personal appearance, and
bearing. Additionally, personal qualities demanded of DAF CP/SG include professionalism,
superior conduct, character, integrity, dependability, mental stability and physical fitness. Each
unit will maintain records of pre-employment evaluations for all applicants both those hired and
rejected in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records.
2.2. Qualification Standards. DAF CP/SG will be required to meet the Office of Personnel
Management (OPM) qualification standards for police or guard positions and conditions of
employment found in Attachment 2.
   2.2.1. Job-related functions, such as strenuous activity, physical exertion, physical agility
   and levels of stress as they pertain to a specific job will be considered for both normal and
   emergency operations. Physical requirements are per Office of Personnel Management
   (OPM) qualification standards, conditions of employment and job analyses.
       2.2.1.1. Medical evaluation for DAF CP/SG applicants and current employees will be
       conducted in accordance with prescribed OPM medical eligibility requirements found in
       5 CFR Ch. I (1–1–07 Edition) 339.202 Medical Standards and 339.205 Medical
       Evaluation Programs and DoD 6055.05M, Occupational Medical Examinations
       and Surveillance Manual. These medical standards are designed to ensure the applicants
       for a police or guard position and current employees are physically capable of performing
       the required arduous, hazardous duties of Integrated Defense (ID) and “national security”
       without creating a threat to the health or safety of themselves or others.
       2.2.1.2. Physical agility testing (PAT) is applicable to all DAF CP/SG personnel and will
       be conducted in accordance with Chap 6, after being medically cleared by an AF
       physician. Attachment 3 will be used to document medical certification completion prior
       to the PAT. The local implementation of the PAT action may fall within the guidelines
       of your collective bargaining agreements and should be staffed through your local Labor
       Relations Officer for assistance in meeting any local bargaining obligations.
           2.2.1.2.1. Applicants must obtain a medical clearance from a licensed physician prior
           to taking the initial PATs, as described in Attachment 2 and 3. Applicants will obtain
           documentation from his/her physician which will be reviewed by an Air Force
           medical officer for approval. If the AF physician does not have Federal status, the
           clearance will be approved by the supporting medical officer having Federal status as
           indicated in Attachment 3. Current DAF CP/SG (non-probationary) will, prior to
           taking their PATs, undergo a medical evaluation in accordance with Attachment 2
           and OPM medical evaluation standards and Air Force Surgeon General
           cardiovascular examination guidelines found in AFPAM 48-133, Physical
           Examination Techniques. Credentialed Government or civilian physicians may
           conduct the medical evaluation. The requirements and guidelines OPM standards
           DoD 6055.05M and Optional Form (OF) 178 (U.S. Office of Personnel Management
10                                                          AFI31-122 22 DECEMBER 2010


        Certificate of Medical Examination), will be provided to the examining physician to
        guide them in their evaluation.
     2.2.1.3. Medical evaluation guidelines and procedures supportive of requirements are
     found in Attachment 4 and 5. A copy of these requirements and OF 178 should be
     provided to medical authorities conducting medical evaluation of DAF CP/SG and
     applicants.
        2.2.1.3.1. To be finally selected, examinees must be medically certified to the
        appointing officer as eligible under such standards.
     2.2.1.4. Appropriate administrative suspension, termination, or retirement action, as
     determined by each DFC in consultation with the servicing Civilian Personnel Officer
     (CPO) and legal advisor, will be taken for currently employed DAF CP/SGs who are
     determined by medical examination to possess lasting medical or psychiatric conditions
     that, in the judgment of the examining physician, constitute a direct threat to the health or
     safety of themselves or others or will adversely affect performance of assigned duties.
     When an appeal is made, the AFSFC Commander will create the Air Force Security
     Forces Qualifications Review Board (SF-QRB) to make the necessary employment-
     related decisions as described in Attachment 12.
     2.2.1.5. All otherwise qualified applicants will undergo the Job Compatibility
     Assessments (JCA) as part of the interview/selection process. The DFC is responsible for
     the successful completion of the JCA for all applicants as part of the applicant’s
     interview. The JCA provides the DFC/hiring authority a tool for the selection of the best
     DAF CP/SG applicant. DAF CP/SGs will take the JCA survey only once.
        2.2.1.5.1. The JCA will be mailed to each participating SFS unit’s training section. It
        will be accounted for and secured in a metal container in the unit and will be handled
        as FOUO and treated as sensitive testing material. Administration instructions for the
        JCA are found in the JCA Procedures Manual which can be found in the Civilian
        Police, Community of Practice (COP) under the JCA Manual Procedures folder:
        https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=AF-DP-00-46. After
        opening the attached link, click on My AFKN on top line and open My CoPS, go to
        SF Civilians and open same. A list of folders under Document Management will
        appear and click on Approved A7S Civilian Guidance then click on the folder, FOUO
        080527-1050 JCA-Procedures-Manual. The JCA Procedures Manual will contain the
        instructions for how the JCA is administered to include scheduling, proctoring,
        shipping/mailing of answer sheets and how the hiring authority can access the
        applicant’s score. The JCA Procedures Manual also contains POCs for AFPC
        support.
     2.2.1.6. DAF CP/SG as per Position Description, Recruitment Knowledge, Skills and
     Abilities must demonstrate during interview the ability to speak, read, write, and
     understand English sufficiently to execute job requirements.
     2.2.1.7. DAF CP/SG must be able to operate all Security Forces vehicles and installed
     equipment and will possess a valid driver’s license. The DFC will be notified and
     CPO/CPF will be contacted for advice regarding options defined by applicable Federal
AFI31-122 22 DECEMBER 2010                                                                     11


     and/or agency instruction for personnel whose driver’s license cannot be maintained due
     to suspension or revocation.
  2.2.2. Individuals tentatively selected for appointment to DAF CP/SG positions will be
  subject to the following pre-employment checks/inquiries. Checks/inquiries will be
  requested by the security forces unit/organization and performed by the Information
  Protection Office to meet the minimal NACI standard. The DFC will be notified and
  CPO/CPF will be contacted for advice regarding options defined by applicable Federal
  and/or agency instruction for employees whose security clearance is revoked or their
  suitability to maintain a security clearance is in question.
     2.2.2.1. Local files check. This is normally a check of the Security Forces Management
     Information System (SFMIS) and/or Defense Central Index of Investigations (DCII) to
     determine if unfavorable information has been recorded on individuals covering the time
     period of age 18 to present.
     2.2.2.2. Reference check.     This is a check with former employers, supervisors and
     personal references.
     2.2.2.3. Arrest and Criminal History Records Check (except where prohibited by local
     and state law). This is normally a National Crime Information Center (NCIC) check of
     the state(s) in which an applicant has resided.
     2.2.2.4. National Agency Check Plus Written Inquiries and Credit Check (NACIC).
     These are conducted by OPM for all civilian employees assigned to non-sensitive
     positions and will be required for most basic positions. (See AFI 31-501, Personnel
     Security Program Management). However, when DAF CP/SG positions which are
     normally categorized as non-critical sensitive positions, and may require completion of a
     favorable Access National Agency Check with Written Inquiries and Credit Check
     (ANACI) prior to appointment (See AFI 31-501), filling a position before completion of
     the ANACI will be kept to a minimum. If absolutely necessary, a pre-employment
     waiver may be authorized in writing by appropriate authority listed in AFI 31-501. In
     such cases, the position may be filled only after the ANACI has been initiated, as long as
     favorable NACI has been completed.
         2.2.2.4.1. Responsible officials (See Chapter 3, AFI 31-501) will implement a
         tracking system to ensure records of personnel granted waivers are monitored to
         ensure results are received. CPO will share ANACI results with requesting
         organization upon receipt.
     2.2.2.5. Lautenberg Amendment to the Gun Control Act of 1968, Suitability. This is
     normally determined through an arrest and criminal history records check and/or local
     files check. If favorable determination is made and when hired, the employee will be
     briefed on the Lautenberg Amendment and briefing documented on DD Form 2760,
     Qualification to Possess Firearms or Ammunition, which will be placed and maintained
     in employee’s CPO and Unit personnel file.
  2.2.3. The security forces unit/organization where employment is being sought will make the
  results of the local files check, reference check, and arrest and criminal history records check
  available to the CPO/Civilian Personnel Flight (CPF) with a recommendation to continue or
  discontinue processing of the applicant. Results of the ANACI are normally provided to
 12                                                          AFI31-122 22 DECEMBER 2010


   CPO/CPF by AFCAF or OPM. Receipt of the ANACI results, the last piece of information,
   thus makes available all pre-employment information to hiring officials for use in making
   hiring decisions. Additionally, provisions of HSPD-12 allow issuance of the CAC after a
   favorable return on fingerprints.
   2.2.4. DFC of outside CONUS (OCONUS) MAJCOMs will utilize the necessary security
   screening procedures to ensure the spirit and intent of this instruction is met. The
   Information Protection office will be used for this process. The cooperation of the host
   country will be solicited, as needed.
2.3. Drug Testing. All DAF CP/SG will be subject to the AF random drug testing program as a
condition of employment. All DAF CP/SG applicants will receive a letter from CPO directing
the administration of a drug test (Condition of Employment for Certain Civilian Positions
Identified as Sensitive Positions Under the Department of the Air Force, Drug-Free Federal
Workplace Program) and pass the drug test per DoDD 1010.9, DoD Civilian Employees Drug
Abuse Testing Program, and AFI 36-810, Substance Abuse Prevention Control, before being
hired. Additionally, drug testing may be required as a result of an accident or an unsafe practice
and for employees in sensitive positions. The extent to which such employees are tested and the
criteria for such testing shall be determined by the Head of each DoD Component, based on the
mission and its employees' duties, the efficient use of resources, the danger to public health and
safety or to U.S. national security that might result from the failure of an employee to discharge
his or her position adequately.
2.4. Medical Standards. To achieve its mission of delivering security services to protect Air
Force and Department of Defense (DoD) personnel and resources worldwide, the Air Force
requires a capable and physically fit DAF CP/SG work force.
   2.4.1. The Air Force medical examinations include:
       2.4.1.1. Pre-employment exams.
       2.4.1.2. Fitness for duty exams.
       2.4.1.3. Periodic occupational health and injury compensation examinations.
       2.4.1.4. Chemical, breath, blood, or urine tests prescribed by AFI 31-218 (I), Motor
       Vehicle Traffic Supervision, and existing laws.
   2.4.2. Disclosure of these and similar medical examinations and the resulting medical
   records and information are prescribed by AFI 41-210, Patient Administration Function, and
   do not fall under confidentiality requirements.
   2.4.3. Medical evaluation for DAF CP/SG applicants and current employees will be
   conducted in accordance with prescribed OPM and DoD 6055.05M, Occupational Medical
   Examinations and Surveillance Manual. The following excerpts from applicable laws,
   regulations and policies are provided for informational purposes.
       2.4.3.1. Law: 5 U.S.C. Section 3301, Civil Service; generally the President may ascertain
       the fitness of employees as to age, health, character, knowledge, and ability for the
       employment sought.
       2.4.3.2. Code of Federal Regulations:
           2.4.3.2.1. 5 CFR Part 339 – Medical Qualifications Determinations
AFI31-122 22 DECEMBER 2010                                                                   13


         2.4.3.2.2. 339.101 Coverage. This part applies to all employees or all employees in
         competitive or excepted service positions.
         2.4.3.2.3. 339.102 Purpose and Effect, subparagraph (c). Failure to meet a properly
         established medical standard or physical requirement under this part means that the
         individual is not qualified for the position unless a waiver or reasonable
         accommodation is indicated, as described in subparts 339.103 and 339.204. An
         employee’s refusal to be examined in accordance with a proper agency order
         authorized under this part is grounds for appropriate disciplinary or adverse action.
         2.4.3.2.4. 339.202 Medical Standards. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM)
         may establish or approve medical standards for a Government-wide occupation (i.e.,
         an occupation common to more than one agency). An agency may establish medical
         standards for positions that predominate in that agency (i.e., where the agency has 50
         percent or more of the positions in a particular occupation). Such standards must be
         justified on the basis that the duties of the position are arduous or hazardous, or
         require a certain level of health status or fitness because the nature of the positions
         involves a high degree of responsibility toward the public or national security
         concerns. The rationale for establishing the standard must be documented. Standards
         established by OPM or an agency must be established by written directive and
         uniformly applied; directly related to the actual requirements of the position; and,
         consistent with OPM instructions published in 5 CFR Part 339.
         2.4.3.2.5. 339.203 Physical Requirements. Agencies are authorized to establish
         physical requirements for individual positions without OPM approval when such
         requirements are considered essential for successful job performance. The
         requirements must be clearly supported by the actual duties of the position and
         documented in the position description.
         2.4.3.2.6. 339.205. Medical evaluation programs. Agencies may establish periodic
         examination or immunization programs by written policies or directives to safeguard
         the health of employees whose work may subject them or others to significant health
         or safety risks due to occupational or environmental exposure or demands. The need
         for a medical evaluation program must be clearly supported by the nature of the work.
         The specific positions covered must be identified and the employees or incumbents
         notified in writing of the reasons for including the positions in the program.
  2.4.4. The DAF CP/SG medical examination program includes a mandatory medical
  evaluation prior to performing the PAT, pre-placement medical examination, periodic
  medical examinations, and return to duty or fitness for duty examinations when the employee
  develops a medical condition that permanently impacts their ability to perform the essential
  functional and work condition elements of the position. Employees must report and provide
  complete and accurate medical information to the examining and reviewing physicians, and
  disclose any prior health issues or treatments -- including mental health issues or treatment.
  A civilian doctor can be used to perform the examination, but must be reviewed by a MRO
  with Federal Status.
  2.4.5. The Medical Review Officer (MRO) shall be a currently licensed doctor of medicine
  (M.D.) or osteopathy (D.O.) assigned to the base Military Treatment Facility. The MRO
 14                                                         AFI31-122 22 DECEMBER 2010


   shall be qualified to provide professional expertise in the areas of occupational safety and
   health as they relate to the program and policies established under this program.
   2.4.6. Civilian employees at occupational risk for vaccine–preventable disease. In
   accordance with AFJI 48-110, Immunizations and Chemoprophylaxis, Federal civilian
   employees at risk of exposure to an infectious disease associated with their occupation will
   receive appropriate immunizations without charge at military activities. Immunizations will
   be administered upon recommendation of the responsible occupational medicine authority.
   For Federal employees in a bargaining unit, local management must meet applicable labor
   relations obligations before implementing any changes to the bargaining unit employees’
   conditions of employment. Civilian personnel offices provide guidance on these matters.
2.5. Medical Evaluation Program
   2.5.1. The purpose of the Medical Evaluation Program is to ensure DAF CP/SG personnel
   are able to safely perform the physical fitness and work condition requirements for their
   position.
      2.5.1.1. An initial medical evaluation will be completed on all DAF CP/SG personnel
      upon employment, periodically and on termination if there is a reasonable belief the
      employee was exposed to a job related hazardous material or condition that adversely
      could affect the employee’s health. The offer of employment will be contingent on
      medical certification of the ability to perform the essential job functions. The initial
      medical evaluation will be accomplished during initial pre-placement evaluation of
      potential selectees.
          2.5.1.1.1. Veterans must provide a (VA Certificate) as part of the application process
          if they claim veteran’s preference as a disabled veteran. The VA Certificate provides
          eligibility for the preferential treatment by the personnel community.
          2.5.1.1.2. The VA Rating Decision is a critical document that not only provides
          information regarding the percentage of disabilities(s) that have been determined to
          be service-connected but also provides an extensive analysis of the medical basis used
          to support the disability rating. Each veteran who has been awarded veterans
          preference based on a service-connected disability for hiring, will bring their VA
          Rating Decision to all physical examinations. This will allow the medical officer to
          fully understand the limitations which may be placed on the individual based on the
          documented rationale for the disability ratings. The VA Ratings Decision form does
          not challenge the right to preferential hiring but merely provides the AF Medical
          Officer with details of the disabilities.
      2.5.1.2. The DAF CP/SG, periodic medical evaluation must not exceed a three year
      period. The examining physician will tailor this periodic evaluation as clinically
      indicated, based upon risk factors, and in accordance with guidance from Air Force
      Surgeon General (HQ USAF/SG). Supervisors are responsible for coordinating the
      evaluation of their personnel. A medical evaluation may be accomplished more
      frequently if, in the interim, there are medical signs or symptoms suggestive of a medical
      condition that might interfere with the performance of essential job functions, or at the
      discretion of the examining physician. Continuing medical evaluations (including
      cardiovascular evaluation) of DAF CP/SG will be accomplished in accordance DoD
AFI31-122 22 DECEMBER 2010                                                                    15


     Manual 6055.05M, Occupational Medical Examinations and Surveillance Manual, (See
     Attachment 5). These documents assist the examining physician in identifying conditions
     that ordinarily might be expected to interfere with the performance of one or more
     essential job functions as described in (Attachment 4).
     2.5.1.3. Individual medical information, such as hospital records, specialized tests or an
     examination by another medical specialist, may be required to determine if an individual
     can perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable
     accommodation. If a condition develops in a DAF CP/SG employee that permanently
     restricts the individual from performing the essential functional or work conditions of the
     position, the MRO should place the individual on appropriate restrictions until a Fitness
     For Duty determination can be made per 5 CFR Part 339. The DFC will be advised
     promptly of any medical condition that may impact the employee’s ability to perform the
     essential functions of the job. When the DFC’s evaluation suggests the employee’s ability
     to perform the essential functions of the job is affected for a significant period with no
     solution available from reasonable accommodation, the DFC/Supervisor shall notify the
     servicing CPO. The servicing CPO and the servicing legal advisor will assist the DFC
     with any appropriate personnel action. If the employee cannot be accommodated in the
     current position, the CPO must look for a reassignment to a job for which the employee is
     qualified. Termination exams include evaluations prompted by potential work exposures
     or as otherwise clinically indicated.
  2.5.2. Specific knowledge of the tasks typically performed and the conditions under which
  the tasks are performed are a crucial component necessary to render an accurate occupational
  medical opinion. Resources that describe police officer/security guard qualifications, but not
  limited to, are: description of duties, training requirements, qualifications/classification
  standards, and essential job tasks (see Attachment 4). The OF 178, Certificate of Medical
  Examination, or equivalent, will be used to document the medical provider’s evaluation and
  disposition.
  2.5.3. A medical certificate signed by a military facility physician or physician extender, to
  verify the individual is able to perform the Physical Agility Test (PAT) with minimal risk to
  safety and health, will be completed initially and prior to the PAT (see Attachment 3). The
  examining physician will check all items of medical significance necessary to accurately
  report sufficient medical information to fully describe the individual’s current medical
  condition, including reviewing the individual’s medical history. The signed medical
  certificate will be submitted by the employee to the SF unit prior to the individual performing
  the PAT. The Medical Review Officer (MRO) should be consulted as the final approving
  authority when there are questions.
  2.5.4. During an incumbent’s medical evaluation, when the examining physician identifies
  one or more medical conditions that will interfere with the DAF CP/SG’s performance of the
  essential functional or work conditions of the position and a medical standard disqualification
  recommendation must be conducted, the AFSFC/CC appoints an MRO and creates an Air
  Force Security Forces Qualifications Review Board (SF-QRB) to make the necessary
  employment-related decisions (See Attachment 12).
  2.5.5. All initial and periodic medical screening/examinations required of applicants and
  incumbent DAF CP/SGs under this AFI will be conducted at government expense in
 16                                                          AFI31-122 22 DECEMBER 2010


   government facilities and by an AF designated physician or physician extender when
   possible; all required screening/examinations are subject to review and approval by an AF
   designated physician or physician extender. The examinations are limited to ensuring that the
   individual meets established thresholds and is fit to perform the duties of the assigned
   position. If the individual does not meet established thresholds, additional tests, studies and
   medical assessments to prove that the individual is capable of safely performing the full
   range of assigned essential activities (with or without accommodation) are obtained at the
   discretion and expense of the individual.
2.6. Position Descriptions (PDs). It is desirable that only those position description documents
approved by the DAF CP/SG CFM will be used for hiring of DAF CP/SGs. Generic PDs for
0085 Security Guard, 0083 Police Officer and 0080 Security Specialist (Law Enforcement) can
be found in the SCPD/SPD Library under the Air Force Manpower Agency website,
https://www.my.af.mil/gcssaf/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?channelPageId=s6925EC1336E40FB
5E044080020E329A9 . The Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) will maintain position
descriptions for their civilian police officers.
   2.6.1. DAF CP Combat Arms (CA) Training personnel should be classified under the 0083
   series and include duties for both CA and Police Officer. The intent is to provide an
   employee who is first a Police Officer and second a CA expert; an employee with enhanced
   knowledge for training that can respond to Integrated Defense emergency situations. This
   requirement is intended for SF unit-level operations. Similarly, other DAF CP evolving
   positions like Military Working Dog Handler should also be classified under the 0083 series.
   2.6.2. A prospective employee (applicant) must meet all conditions of appointment
   described in the CONDITIONS OF APPOINTMENT/OTHER SIGNIFICANT FACTS
   section, usually box number 33 on the reverse side of PD to include:
       2.6.2.1. Must pass an initial pre-employment medical examination and periodic medical
       examinations
       2.6.2.2. Must pass a required initial and annual PAT (See Chap 6)
       2.6.2.3. Must meet established hearing standards and discern colors, contrast, and depth
       2.6.2.4. Must undergo initial and periodic job compatibility assessments
       2.6.2.5. Applicant must be qualified in the use of required weapon(s). To mitigate AF
       liability for injuries to potential DAF CP/SGs that could occur during the conditional
       employment phase of the hiring process, applicants will conduct weapons qualification
       after such a person is accepted as an AF employee, rather than during the conditional
       employment phase. This policy measure is recommended in the legal review by the
       Labor Law Field Support Center/Labor Relations Law Branch. If an employee
       (applicant/incumbent) is unable to qualify on the required weapon(s), the employee can
       be removed as DAF CP/SG as weapons qualification is a requirement to perform the
       employee’s assigned duties.
       2.6.2.6. Must wear a uniform and meet applicable DAF CP/SG dress and appearance
       standards contained within this AFI. For Federal employees in a bargaining unit, local
       management must meet applicable labor relations obligations before implementing any
       changes to the bargaining unit employees’ conditions of employment.
AFI31-122 22 DECEMBER 2010                                                                        17


      2.6.2.7. Subject to annual duty position evaluation (DPE) on a pass/fail standard. See
      paragraph 5.2 for course of action upon failed DPE.
      2.6.2.8. Must possess an automobile drivers’ license currently valid in the State in which
      they are domiciled or principally employed and must complete OF Form 345, as per AFI
      24-301, Vehicle Operation.
   2.6.3. PDs written for 0085 series relegate the position to Security Guard duties; while PDs
   for the 0080(LE) and 0083 series provide the flexibility to utilize these positions in every
   functional SF duty. Training standards to include flightline-oriented taskings (e.g. perform
   SRT member duties, establish a temporary restricted area, tactics) are reflected in DAF
   CP/SG CFETP.
2.7. Continued Service Agreement (CSA)
   2.7.1. A Consecutive Service Agreement (CSA) is an agreement by the employee to
   continue in service upon training completion. As a minimum, all training over 80 hours
   requires a CSA. The period of service obligation begins the first workday after the training
   ends, and is equal to at least three times the length of the training. Longer periods of required
   service are set if justified by the costs of training or other factors, such as situations when an
   employee enters into a period of non-pay status. The Employee Development
   Manager/Specialist (EDM/S) evaluates each instance of training to justify an agency's
   substantial investment of resources. Refer to AFI 36-401, Employee Training and
   Development, for completion of CSA and use of Standard Form (SF) 182. As per AFI 36-401
   AFGM1, Force Development Flights should use the SF 182 to document all training.
   2.7.2. Both the Security Guard and Police Officer courses from the Veterans Affairs Law
   Enforcement Training Center (VA-LETC) fit the requirement for a CSA and completion of
   the SF 182. Additionally, new hires are provided 2 weeks of pre VA-LETC and 3 weeks of
   post VA-LETC local training that can be considered for a CSA per AFI 36-401. Considering
   the total of local and formal training, a CSA for VA-LETC training should be for not less
   than 6 months. As per AFI 36-401, longer periods of required service can be set if justified
   by other factors. For locations that are experiencing difficulty hiring (are below 50%), or
   where applicants receive training and are leaving for other agencies, a 1 year period for the
   CSA will be used. Subsequently, if more training time is required, that time can be factored
   into the obligation period. Employees will sign a CSA (see Attachment 6) and complete an
   SF 182 before commencement of training. Once an employee has signed a CSA and an SF
   182, the Employee Development Manager/Specialist (typically the SF Unit Supervisor or
   Training Superintendent) ensures a system is in place to monitor the date the obligation
   service commitment expires, preventing any separation action from being processed without
   consideration of this obligation.
2.8. Permanent Positions
   2.8.1. As the Department of the Air Force Civilian Police continues to grow and permanent
   positions are gained to replace temporary and term positions, the permanent positions should
   be police officer series 0083, so the force structure provides the same capability as the
   military SF force. Both the United States Marine Corp and the USAF have determined that
   the additional capability of police officers is required for the defense of our personnel and
   resources.
 18                                                            AFI31-122 22 DECEMBER 2010


   2.8.2. It is therefore SF policy that permanent DAF CP personnel working in operational
   flights will be police, series 0083. Combat arms instructors should also be in the 0083 series,
   as per AFI36-2226. The 0080 (Law Enforcement) parenthetical designator will be used
   when classifiers limit the grade levels of 0083 personnel and when duties justify a grade GS-
   10 or higher for a specified position.
   2.8.3. Over hire personnel (non-permanent positions) that are hired for term positions may
   be either police (0083) or security guard (0085). However, units are encouraged to hire
   police officers when possible.
      2.8.3.1. A 0085 security guard will primarily perform the duties of installation entry
      controller.
      2.8.3.2. A 0083 police officer offers the flexibility of utilization as installation entry
      controller, flight line security duties, as well as installation law enforcement and ability to
      perform the full spectrum of Integrated Defense duties. When a unit uses 0083 police
      officers, the officers will be rotated regularly among all positions they are certified in.
   2.8.4. Units should evaluate their missions to determine if the security work their police
   officers perform directly affects “national security” and request those positions be excluded
   from collective bargaining agreement (CBA) as per 5 U.S.C. § 7112(b)(6). This is
   accomplished by conducting a local legal review involving legal, security forces, and
   personnel advisors. It is then followed by preparing a package from the installation wing
   commander to MAJCOM Manpower and Personnel (A1) validating why police officers
   should be excluded from a CBA. The package should include as a minimum a memo, point
   paper, referenced authority described above, current position description(s), and any cases
   with precedent. It is best to request the CBA exemption before hiring the positions. Once
   exemption is granted, the DAF CPs must be used in the duties directly affecting national
   security (e.g. Flightline, Commercial Vehicle Search, LE Desk duties).
2.9. Hiring or Working with Contract Security Personnel If hiring or working with contract
security personnel in an overseas contingency operation, refer to Combatant Commander
Guidance as outlined in DoDI 3020.50,Private Security Contractors Operating in Contingency
Operations.
2.10. Overtime Requirement
   2.10.1. Providing 24-hour SF operations mission coverage will be expected of DAF CP/SG.
   As they prepare for normal shift operations, police and security guards will require overtime
   to accomplish their mission.
   2.10.2. There are numerous duties, activities and situations that will require the need for
   overtime. Although not all inclusive, some of this time involves the pre-shift and post-shift
   activities. Pre-shift activities will normally consist of the issue, receipt, inspection and
   function check of the security equipment. Other activities are briefings on vehicle and
   weapons safety, current threat, various procedures and changes, and security
   deficiencies/items of interest. These activities may be part of the unit’s guardmount. Post-
   shift activities include the turning in of all equipment issued for the shift. It may consist of
   completing and filing/entering reports and paperwork. Routine pre and post-shift activities
   are prescribed in governing documents to include law enforcement/security directives and
   technical orders.
AFI31-122 22 DECEMBER 2010                                                                          19


   2.10.3. Overtime is also required when transporting the DAF CP/SG to and from the
   marshalling area (where the pre and post-shift activities occur, e.g. Operations Facility,
   armory). A determination of the appropriate amount of overtime will be based on the
   distances to and from the fixed posts, amount and type of equipment being used, number and
   complexity of checks required, frequency and depth of briefings. Additionally, there may be
   occasions when an oncoming shift does not have sufficient personnel to meet all mandatory
   posting requirements. Normally the requisite number of personnel from the off-going shift
   would be held over for the minimum time necessary until additional personnel can be
   obtained. The appropriate amount of overtime would be provided in such cases.
   2.10.4. Overtime can easily become an excessive expense. DFCs and DAF CP/SG managers
   and supervisors will strictly monitor overtime to ensure that the appropriate amount is
   authorized given the factors associated with each post. Generally, the most common time for
   a post requiring in-place change over is 1.417 hrs per shift.
2.11. Light Duty for Officers with Medical Restrictions.
   2.11.1. Definition. Light duty status is assignment to work other than an employee’s
   primary duties and that does not necessarily involve performance of all essential functions.
   Light duty may be offered to an officer with a medical condition which temporarily restricts
   the officer from performance of the essential functions of the officer’s assigned position, as
   determined by the officer’s supervisor after review of medical evaluations. Failure to pass the
   PAT indicates an officer cannot safely and fully perform the essential functions of his or her
   assigned position. Likewise, the temporary inability to take the PAT due to a medical
   condition indicates the officer cannot perform the full range of duties of the position. The
   following restrictions are imposed upon employees limited to light duty: (1) employees will
   not wear a uniform or carry a firearm, (2) employee participation in field duties, including
   law enforcement action, is prohibited, (3) employees are not to operate marked patrol
   vehicles and (4) employees are prohibited from direct contact with suspects or prisoners.
   These restrictions are necessary to ensure there is no misunderstanding that an individual on
   light duty is not to perform the essential job functions of the position.
   2.11.2. Legal Framework. The Air Force is not required to remove an essential function of
   the job as a reasonable accommodation. Nor is the AF required to lower either qualitative or
   quantitative standards to make an accommodation. The employee must still be qualified for
   his or her position as a Police Officer or Security Guard in order to be accommodated. Under
   the Rehabilitation Act/ADA, as interpreted by the Equal Employment Opportunity
   Commission, how the employee became disabled (i.e., on the job vs. off duty) is not relevant
   to his or her right to accommodation. If light duty is offered to employees on worker’s
   compensation, then it must be available to employees with disabilities that are not work-
   related. Light duty will be provided to the extent it is available within the Security Forces
   unit and consistent with mission requirements. Temporary assignment to perform light duty
   can include a range of technical and administrative areas that include the following: (1)
   administrative functions (e.g., report review, special projects), (2) clerical or custodial
   functions (e.g., filing, local area clean-up), (3) report taking (e.g., telephone reports), (4) duty
   in a visitor control center that does not involve emergency response in support of other posts
   (e.g., gate back-up, over-watch). If light duty is not available within the Security Forces unit,
   then the available personnel options will be determined through coordination with the
20                                                           AFI31-122 22 DECEMBER 2010


  civilian personnel office. SF leadership should read and be aware of provisions in Chapter 6
  of AFI 36-2706, Equal Opportunity Program, Military and Civilian.
  2.11.3. Reassignment Policy. Reassignment to a new position is a reasonable
  accommodation if no other option exists to permit the employee with a duty limiting
  condition to perform the essential functions of the current position of police officer or
  security guard. Any reassignment must be coordinated with the civilian personnel office.
  Units are not required to create new positions or to move employees from their jobs in order
  to create a vacancy. If no vacant position is available in the Security Forces unit, then a
  search must be conducted across the installation and, if needed, AF-wide to places the
  employee is willing to move at his or her own expense. The employee must be in a
  permanent position to warrant reassignment. All reassignment actions must be processed by
  the servicing civilian personnel office to ensure all actions are processed according to legal
  requirements. The employee must be qualified for the position and the position must be
  vacant. The placement of disabled employees anywhere within DoD to a position at the same
  or lower grade for which he or she can be reasonably accommodated (29 CFR 1614.203) is
  an exception to the Priority Placement Program (PPP).
  2.11.4. Application for Light Duty. If an employee is temporarily unable to perform the
  essential functions of the position (including performance of the PAT), he/she must provide
  documentation from a licensed health care professional (i.e., physician, physician extender).
  Medical documentation provided from outside health care professionals containing protected
  health information regarding diagnosis and/or treatment will be sent only to the AF medical
  provider. Documentation from outside providers sent directly to the employee’s supervisor
  must be limited solely to recommendation(s) for duty limitations. This documentation must
  indicate the existence of a medical condition, the recommended restrictions to work activities
  required because of that condition, the recommended duration of those restrictions, and the
  date, signature and contact information for the recommending provider. The employee’s
  supervisor will review the duty limitations with the assistance of AF medical personnel to
  ensure there is a full understanding of the nature of the documented disability and the
  recommended accommodation. If an employee needs an accommodation, he or she should
  bring the request to his or her supervisor. In addition, Security Forces management personnel
  may request that an employee be evaluated by AF medical personnel if a medical limitation
  that interferes with successful job performance is observed. Requests for employee
  assignment to light duty will be submitted to the Security Forces Commander (or equivalent),
  with recommendations from the first and second level supervisors. Temporary light duty
  workloads will be made available on a first come first serve basis, and may be made
  rotational if more personnel are on light duty status than positions are available. For example,
  if a unit determines that there are 8 hours per day of light duty work, and two employees are
  in a light duty status, then the employees may rotate to accomplish the workloads. Collective
  bargaining agreements can be a means to establish how light duty work is distributed.
  2.11.5. Conditions lasting longer than 30 days. Employee must provide a new health care
  provider note (as described above) at least once each month, where the employee’s condition
  can reasonably be expected to change within the month, to confirm the recommended work
  limitations are still applicable and related to the initial medical condition, and give an
  estimated date of recovery or achievement of optimal medical improvement. Light duty as a
  reasonable accommodation will be offered for the same duration as light duty is made
AFI31-122 22 DECEMBER 2010                                                                   21


   available for individuals on worker’s compensation. Light duty under worker’s compensation
   (where applicable) and as a reasonable accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act/ADA
   should be processed and granted concurrently. Alternate accommodations may be considered
   where they are either agreed to by both the employee and Security Forces or where the
   alternative accommodation is equally effective in allowing the employee to perform the
   essential functions of his or her position.
   2.11.6. Return from Light Duty. An employee wishing to return to regular duty from light
   duty will submit a request to the Defense Force Commander (DFC) (or equivalent), with
   recommendations from the first and second level supervisors. The request will contain
   medical documentation of the employee’s ability to perform the essential functions of the
   position, with or without reasonable accommodation. The commander will coordinate with
   the civilian personnel office and the medical documentation will be reviewed by Air Force
   medical personnel.
2.12. Stand-by. Before assigning DAF CP/SG to stand-by duty, the DFC or SF representative
should consult with Labor Relations Officer and/or the Judge Advocate’s office to ensure correct
assignment and release. It is necessary to follow this procedure so the DFC/SF representative
obtains expert and legal advice before assigning DAF CP/SG personnel to stand-by duty.
 22                                                            AFI31-122 22 DECEMBER 2010


                                            Chapter 3

  AUTHORITY OF DEPARTMENT OF AIR FORCE CIVILIAN POLICE/SECURITY
                            GUARD

3.1. General. This chapter prescribes the authority of DAF CP/SGs performing law
enforcement or security functions on Air Force installation/activities. The DoD Instruction
(DoDI) 5200.08, Security of DoD Installations and Resources, and Section 797 of Title 50,
United States Code (USC), Section 21 of the Internal Security Act of 1950, requires DoD
installation commanders to take reasonably necessary and lawful measures to maintain law and
order to protect installation personnel and property. Based on this authority, the installation
commander has the authority to direct law enforcement and security activities on his/her
installation.
3.2. DAF CP/SG Authority. The DAF CP/SG personnel performing law enforcement and
security duties authorized by the installation/activity commander may apprehend any persons
found on the installation/activity for offenses committed on post that are felonies, misdemeanors,
breaches of the peace, a threat to property or welfare, or detrimental to good order and discipline.
Such apprehension authority is limited to issuing citations and turning the subject over to the
appropriate civilian or military authorities.
   3.2.1. On duty DAF CP/SG personnel are considered part of the DAF, therefore, are subject
   to the restrictions on aid to civilian law enforcement imposed by 18 USC 1385, commonly
   known as the Posse Comitatus Act. Accordingly, any proposed aid to civilian law
   enforcement must be reviewed by the servicing SJA.
       3.2.1.1. DAF SG authority and jurisdiction to perform force protection tasks on their
       installation/activity are valid while performing these duties during their work hours only.
       An on-post apprehension conducted by a DAF SG in an off-duty status is a detention by a
       private citizen. DAF SGs will not carry AF weapons while off duty and they are not
       authorized to store AF weapons at a private residence. AF weapons must be stored in an
       authorized storage facility in accordance with AFI 31-101. AF security guards while on
       duty will not carry privately-owned weapons or privately-owned ammunition. The
       carrying of privately-owned weapons on post by off-duty SGs when participating in an
       authorized off-duty activity such as skeet and trap shooting will be in accordance with
       policy established by the installation/activity commander.
       3.2.1.2. DAF CP authority and jurisdiction to perform law enforcement tasks are valid
       while performing these duties during their work hours only. An on-post apprehension
       conducted by DAF CP in an off-duty status is a detention by a private citizen. DAF CP
       will not carry AF weapons while off duty and they are not authorized to store AF
       weapons at a private residence. AF weapons must be stored in an authorized storage
       facility in accordance with AFI 31-101. AF weapons are not permitted for carrying on a
       standby basis. DAF CP while on duty will not carry privately-owned weapons or
       privately-owned ammunition. The carrying of privately-owned weapons on post by off-
       duty DAF CP when participating in an authorized off-duty activity such as skeet and trap
       shooting will be in accordance with policy established by the installation/activity
       commander.
AFI31-122 22 DECEMBER 2010                                                                        23


   3.2.2. Assimilative Crimes Act. Makes criminal and adopts state criminal laws for areas of
   exclusive or concurrent Federal jurisdiction provided Federal criminal law, including the
   UCMJ, has not defined an applicable offense for the misconduct committed.
3.3. Posse Comitatus Act. The Congress of the United States enacted this law in 1878 to
restrict the use of the military to enforce civil law, Title 18, U.S.C., Section 1385. See also Title
10 U.S.C., Section 375. This Act applies to both SF military members and DAF CP/SG.
   3.3.1. This act prevents military personnel from executing the laws of the states or the laws
   of the United States except when acting under the authority of the US Constitution, an Act of
   Congress, and under the direction of the President of the United States. Posse Comitatus
   governs the use of military personnel only within the Continental United States (CONUS) to
   include Alaska, Hawaii and the US Territories. The Act does not apply to National Guard
   personnel performing in Title 32 status under the command of a State governor.
   3.3.2. This act does not prevent:
       3.3.2.1. Security Forces from using force to stop a fleeing felon or suspected felon for
       the purpose of aiding civilian law enforcement.
       3.3.2.2. Actions in the performance of duties employed “off-duty” as a security guard or
       police officer (i.e. SF members with second jobs).
3.4. Deputization of Air Force Law Enforcement Personnel by State and Local
Governments. Per AFI 31-201, the Secretary of the Air Force is the approval authority for the
deputization by state and local governments of uniformed law enforcement personnel under the
authority of the Air Force, including Security Forces, civilian police, and/or security guards.
   3.4.1. If state or local deputization is needed, the senior installation law enforcement official
   will prepare the request. The request will be based on the justification guidelines established
   in DoDI 5525.13, Limitation of Authority to Deputize DoD Uniformed Law Enforcement
   Personnel by State and Local Governments, and will include:
       3.4.1.1. The number of uniformed law enforcement personnel to be granted the authority
       and a certification that they have received the requisite training to affect the type of
       deputization.
       3.4.1.2. The time frame envisioned for the authority to be exercised. Blanket time
       authorizations will not be considered.
       3.4.1.3. The policies and procedures to prevent misuse of the authority to be employed
       by the requesting installation law enforcement official.
       3.4.1.4. A copy of the proposed memorandum of understanding with the state or local
       jurisdiction that will carry out the deputization, to include the signature of the appropriate
       official representing that state or local jurisdiction.
   3.4.2. Requests for approval will follow the appropriate chain of command to the Secretary
   of the Air Force for approval. The request may be disapproved at any level. As a minimum,
   requests will be coordinated through the following:
       3.4.2.1. Installation Commander
       3.4.2.2. Major Command (MAJCOM) Chief of Security Forces (A7S)
 24                                                           AFI31-122 22 DECEMBER 2010


       3.4.2.3. Commander, HQ Air Force Security Forces Center
       3.4.2.4. HAF/A7S Director of Security Forces
       3.4.2.5. AF/JA
       3.4.2.6. SAF/GC
       3.4.2.7. SAF/IG
   3.4.3. The Secretary of the Air Force will consider the request and return a decision through
   appropriate channels.
3.5. Authority to Deputize DoD Uniformed Law Enforcement Personnel by State and
Local Governments
   3.5.1. Because of potential conflicts of interest, it is Air Force policy that DAF CP/SGs will
   not be deputized or exercise any additional authority or jurisdiction granted by local, state, or
   Federal governments to perform law enforcement duties on or off a military installation or
   facility while wearing the duty uniform and/or badge.
   3.5.2. In accordance with DoDI 5525.13, Limitation of Authority to Deputize DoD
   Uniformed Law Enforcement Personnel by State and Local Governments, paragraph 8, any
   existing cases of deputization of Air Force uniformed law enforcement personnel by state
   and local governments that have not been approved by the Secretary of the Air Force are
   invalid. Any existing cases will not be grandfathered where those cases do not have the
   approval of the Secretary of the Air Force as per DoDI 5525.13, paragraph 4.3. Cases
   involving the exercise of law enforcement powers off the military installation on non-military
   affiliated personnel are tantamount to deputization and will require the legal review as per
   this AFI.
   3.5.3. Requests for an exception to this prohibition will be submitted in accordance with
   DoDI 5525.13, as described in paragraph 3.4, above. The approval authority is the Secretary
   of the Air Force.
   3.5.4. This prohibition does not apply to DAF CP/SG employed while off duty by local,
   state, or Federal governments.
3.6. Limitations. DAF CP/SGs’ authority and jurisdiction to perform integrated defense tasks
on the installation/activity are valid while on-duty, during their work hours only. An on-base
apprehension conducted by a DAF CP/SG in an off-duty status is a detention by a private citizen.
DAF CP/SGs will not carry Air Force issued weapons while off-duty, and they are not
authorized to store Air Force issued weapons at a private residence. Air Force issued weapons
are not permitted for carrying on a stand-by basis. DAF CP/SGs will not carry privately-owned
weapons or privately-owned ammunition while on the installation. Procedures for carrying
privately –owned weapons on the installation while in off-duty status are covered in AFI 31-101.
3.7. Identification. DAF CP/SGs are issued a standardized identification DoD Common Access
Card (CAC). The duty uniform and DAF CP/SG badge are other identification uniform items
that may only be worn while on duty or while traveling to and from work as determined by the
DFC. While wearing the duty uniform and badge, civilian police officers/security guards may
intervene to perform law enforcement tasks on their installation only. Management and executive
level 0083 personnel do not wear or display the DAF CP badge on a regular basis. For these
AFI31-122 22 DECEMBER 2010                                                                   25


positions the badge will only be displayed in specific environments where appropriate to enhance
esprit de corps, camaraderie and professional pride in the Air Force police profession.
Acceptable circumstances where the badge may be displayed are official ceremonies,
graduations, professional police conferences and where it is customary and widely practiced to
display police affiliation and the member is attending in an official capacity.
3.8. OCONUS. When applicable, the authority and liability of DAF CP/SGs overseas depends
on applicable international agreements, Status of Forces Agreement, and local law. Seek the
advice of OCONUS SJA regarding the status of such personnel.
3.9. Written Instructions Delegation of authority for DAF CP/SGs to perform their duties will
be directed to the Installation DFC. The commander’s responsibility includes the selection,
employment, training, certification, management, and supervision of DAF CP/SG personnel; the
issuance of standing operating procedures (SOPs) which define the scope of their authority
(persons, places, and offenses within their security enforcement jurisdiction); and the
establishment of written procedures for notifying each DAF CP/SG of the extent of their
authority (specific empowerment and limitations) as described above, and procedures for
suspending and withdrawing their security enforcement authority. The DFC will coordinate all
policies and procedures concerning authority and jurisdiction with the installation Staff Judge
Advocate. All such policies and procedures will be reviewed at least every two years for
adequacy and legal sufficiency. In addition, procedures must be established to ensure each DAF
CP/SG acknowledges in writing, a clear understanding of their authority and jurisdiction (See
Attachment 2). Written instructions will be reviewed at least once a year and updated, if
necessary. Because of potential conflicts of interest and Posse Comitatus Act issues, DAF
CP/SGs while wearing the duty uniform and/or badge, may not be deputized or exercise any
additional authority and jurisdiction other than that given by the installation/unit commander
while on duty. This consideration includes the Secretary of the Air Force exception for
deputization, as per DoDI 5525.13.

                   UNIFORMS FOR CIVILIAN POLICE AND GUARDS

4.1. Covered Employees. The content of this chapter applies to any civilian employed as DAF
CP/SG by the Air Force. EXCEPTION: Optional for any police or guard employee whose
primary duty requires them to serve in the field of investigation, subject to the approval of the
unit commander.
4.2. Purpose of the Uniform. Employees must wear the prescribed duty uniform for the
purpose of identification and as evidence of authority.
4.3. Uniform Allowances for DAF CP/SG.
   4.3.1. Initial Allowance. As per DoDI 1400.25, Vol 591, DoD Civilian Personnel
   Management System: Uniform Allowance Rates for DoD Civilian Employees, para 4.e. and
   4.c., payment of an initial allowance in the amount of $1,800.00 or a lower initial allowance
   equal to the cost of the uniform, whichever is less, is authorized. The initial allowance of
   $1,800.00 is authorized for civilian police only. The initial allowance payment of $800.00 is
   authorized for security guards. These amounts will be reviewed annually with installation
   level inputs and may receive adjustments based upon inflation, revisions, etc. The reviews
   may be discontinued in the event the allowance amount has reached the cap. In lieu of an
   initial/annual allowance, the unit may furnish the DAF CP or SG an initial/annual clothing
   issue. All uniform items required are covered as part of the uniform allowance. Executive
   level staff, management and other 0083 personnel who wear civilian attire are not authorized
   a uniform allowance. Where an existing CBA specifies uniform standards different from the
   one identified in AFI 31-122, DFCs will ensure the future rewrite of the CBA complies with
   this AFI and Supplement(s).
   4.3.2. Replacement Allowance. An $800 annual replacement allowance is authorized after
   one complete year of service IAW DoDI 1400.25. After one complete year of service, DAF
   CP/SG will receive a $200.00 (or a lower allowance equal to the cost of the uniform
   whichever is less) quarterly replacement allowance until the individual is no longer serving
   as a DAF CP/SG.” AFRC authorizes an annual payment not to exceed $800 per year or equal
   to the cost of the uniform.
4.4. Required/Prohibition of Wearing the DAF CP/SG Uniform. All personnel will wear the
DAF CP/SG standard uniform when on duty unless an exception is granted for wear of civilian
clothes for mission reasons as determined by the DFC. All service uniform combinations are
authorized for year-round wear. However, appropriate discretion will be used based on weather
conditions and duties. Installation Commander or DFC may authorize DAF CP/SG the wear of
an alternate light blue color shirt for extreme hot climatic conditions, but only for the period of
the extreme conditions. The alternate shirt must meet standards of the duty shirt. The light blue
shirt is an optional item that will be funded by the unit/installation. Unless specifically
prohibited, installation or unit commanders may authorize DAF CP/SG to continue to wear
uniform items changed in design or material as long as the item remains in serviceable condition.
The uniform item can be worn up until the date the item is phased out.
AFI31-122 22 DECEMBER 2010                                                                       27

       off the installation for returning troops).
       4.4.1.3. When attending any meeting or event which is a function of, or is sponsored by,
       an extremist organization.
       4.4.1.4. When participating in civilian court proceedings unless serving as a government
       witness.

       4.4.1.7. Unless specifically authorized by this AFI, uniform pieces will not be worn as
       parts of civilian attire. For example: cap devices, badges and other U.S. or Air Force
       insignia and/or distinctive buttons. Exception: Tie Tacks and lapel pins when wearing
       civilian business attire are authorized.
       4.4.1.8. In accordance with the Joint Ethics Regulation, DoD 5500.7-R, DAF CP/SG

   public conveyance (for example, subway, train, plane, or bus).
   4.4.3. Employees may not wear articles of the primary duty uniform with the utility uniform
   and vice versa unless specifically authorized. Employees may purchase and wear approved
   optional items addressed by this directive when authorized by unit commanders. Employees
   must procure sufficient quantities of uniform articles to allow time for garments to be cleaned
   or laundered, and for making any emergency change in uniform that may be required.
   4.4.4. For OCO converted positions code ‘ZA’ will be used when purchasing uniforms. For
   permanent positions, the unit funding code will be used.
4.5. Protective/Reflective and Foul Weather Clothing and Equipment. As per DoDI
1400.25, the authorized management official will require the wear of uniform items after a
determination has been made that the nature of their work makes the wearing of a uniform
necessary. Protective clothing and equipment such as reflective clothing/equipment, safety-
goggles, safety-shoes, hearing protection, bullet resistant vests, helmet and respiratory protection
for escape purposes will be obtained through supply channels according to applicable regulations
or instructions. Employees will wear protective clothing and equipment according to the policies
set by the installation commander/DFC.

   authorize an armed SF member the unique and specific use of the DAF civilian police badge.
   The badge can only be used in a credential holder while the escort is under travel orders to
   transport a confinee. Further, the credential wallet, AF Form 688c, Armed Transfer Agent,
   with DAF civilian police or SF badge, will be accounted for by the confinement officer or
   DFC. Upon return from an armed transfer mission, the credential wallet, AF Form 688c, and
   DAF civilian police badge will be re-secured in either a locked drawer or cabinet by the
   confinement officer or DFC. At no time will the escort have the issued credential/badge
   when they are not engaged in confinee escort duties.
   4.32.3. The following guidelines apply to the issue and wear of the civilian police/security
   guard badge:

       4.32.3.3. Upon retirement or termination of the bearer, the badge will be retrieved by the
       unit.
       4.32.3.4. Reissue serviceable badges turned in by personnel who have separated.
       4.32.3.5. Wear the metallic badge only on the outer most garment, primary shirt or
       jacket.

                                          Chapter 5

             CIVILIAN POLICE / GUARD TRAINING AND EVALUATION

5.1. General Information. Standardized training, certification, evaluation and perpetual
updating are the apex to a professional police training program. DAF CP/SG are required to
attend the VA-LETC or approved equivalent school to receive formal basic law
enforcement/security guard training credit for certification. Each unit training section will
complete the local pre and post formal home station training/OJT and/or SF military-specific
subjects training when scheduling a DAF CP/SG to attend VA-LETC (see Attachments 9/11).
   5.1.1. Minimum training standards for DAF CP/SG were established by the DoD CP/SG
   Training Standards Working Group. These training standards serve as minimum training
   standards for all DAF CP/SG. Training standards can be found in Attachments 9 thru 11, the
   DAF CP/SG CFETP and the Unit METLs. Exception: Modifications to these training
   standards for staff level management and executive level 0083 positions must be individually
   approved by HQ AF/A7S and documented in the individual employee training record. Career
   Development Course (CDC) e-enrollment by DAF CP/SG is available for use by DAF
   CP/SG and is highly recommended. Understanding all aspects of SF operations, including
   unique military employment tasks, helps civilian employees recognize the challenges of their
   military SF counterparts. It also helps civilian employees consider all aspects of complex
   integrated defense procedures that could be encountered in a crisis and generally improves
   civilian supervision of military personnel. SF unit leadership should encourage completion of
   the CDCs by SF civilians, especially those interested in advancement.
5.2. Unit Training Sections. Unit training sections will use the minimum training standards
found in the unit METLs/DAF CFETP to establish a DAF CP/SG Standardization and
Evaluation (stan/eval) Program and use the existing active duty training program as a guide. The
program will require each DAF CP/SG to receive training and certification followed by a Duty
Position Evaluation(s) as required by AFI36-2225. When an individual fails a DPE, the S-
3/Operations Officer and S-3/Operations Superintendent will determine remedial training
requirements based on the recommendations from the individual’s immediate chain of command.
The employee can be removed as DAF CP/SG as passing the annual duty position evaluation is a
requirement in the position description and agreement for conditions of employment. The DFC
will be briefed on the failure and the recommended courses of action.
   5.2.1. DAF CP/SG must successfully complete their assigned unit’s standardized training
   program which will include initial training, certification, evaluation and
   sustainment/recurring training requirements as per AFI36-2225. Training records will be
   maintained as per AFI 36-2225 and AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed
   of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
   https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm. Training requirements will be
   documented using AFTRs first and when not possible will be through the use of the
   following forms:
       5.2.1.1. AF Form 55, Employee Safety and Health Record, to document safety training.
       5.2.1.2. AF Form 522, AF Form 522, USAF Ground Weapons Training Data, to
       document individual weapons training.
AFI31-122 22 DECEMBER 2010                                                                    43


      5.2.1.3. AF Form 623, Individual Training Record Folder, to record individual training.
      AF Form 623a, On-The-Job Training Record-Continuation Sheet, to record
      supplementary information in individual training records.
      5.2.1.4. AF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation/Command JQS, to
      document qualification training.
      5.2.1.5. AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, to document
      SF recurring and sustainment training.
      5.2.1.6. All electronic forms generated by AFTR.
   5.2.2. Qualify with assigned weapons. Training will be IAW AFI 31-207, Arming and Use
   of Force by Air Force Personnel. AFI 31-207, states that DoD military, civilian, and
   contract personnel performing law enforcement, security or force protection duties or
   personnel serving in an AFSC that specifies qualification to bear firearms as a mandatory
   requirement, fall under Group A. Group “A” personnel will complete weapons qualification
   training once every 12 months on all weapons with which they are armed. Training consists
   of classroom and live-fire qualification IAW AFI 36-2226, Combat Arms Program.
   Additionally, as per AFI 31-207 Group “A” personnel must complete any unit level
   proficiency/sustainment training required on their primary weapon 5 to 7 months after each
   12 month qualification.
      5.2.2.1. Per unit SOPs, DAF CP/SGs will wear appropriate law enforcement equipment
      and duty belt placement with either M-9 and/or M-4 arming configurations.
   5.2.3. Weapons firing for applicants that are qualifying for pre-employment will be the
   AFQC course of fire; thereafter, Group “A” DAF Civilian Police/Security Guard will fire the
   prescribed course(s) of fire on all weapons with which they are armed, as per AFI 36-2226,
   to maintain their annual weapons qualification. During weapons qualification, if an
   employee (applicant/incumbent) is unable to qualify on the required weapon(s), the employee
   can be removed as DAF CP/SG as weapons qualification is a requirement to perform the
   employee’s assigned duties. For weapons training by other than AF Combat Arms Personnel
   and for Unit Live-Fire Proficiency/Sustainment Training, see AFI 36-2226.
   5.2.4. Unit stan/eval sections will maintain written documentation of DPEs and
   qualifications using prescribed forms or computer generated products as per AFI 36-2225.
5.3. DAF Civilian Police/Security Guard Training Waiver Procedures
   5.3.1. Training Waiver Procedures. In accordance with AFI 36-2201V5, Air Force

     state certified guard course and the course curriculum certified transcript.
     5.3.5.3. A waiver request from an honorably discharged military service member shall
     include a graduation certificate from the respective branch Military Police course and a
     certified copy of his/her DD-214 listing the correct Military Police occupational code for
     respective branch of service. (See Attachment 8, Academy Attendance Waiver Request -
     Sample).
     5.3.5.4. The DFC will determine if the waiver applicant’s past curriculum matches or
     exceeds the curriculum summaries in the DAF Civilian Police/Security Guard Training
     List, (See Attachment 10, Evaluation Instructions). Because Air Force law enforcement
     differs from other Federal, state and municipal police functions, applicants with
     acceptable academic qualifications (meeting or exceeding all Training List subjects) may
     still need to complete some initial training in Military Specific (MS) and Home Station
     (HS) subjects (See Attachment 9). MAJCOMs may direct subordinate units to provide
     waiver packages (approved or denied) to the MAJCOM Security Forces Training Section
     not to exceed 90 days from the date of the initial hire.
  5.3.6. New Hire Not Meeting Waiver Requirements. The DFC will assign a new hire that
  does not meet waiver requirements and is in awaiting formal training status only to posts that
  will have a certified Civilian or Military SF member as overseer of the new hire, i.e. IEC,
  SRT/Patrol member. The new hire must have received all appropriate local training required
  for the assigned posts. The new hire must attend VA-LETC formal training as soon as
  possible, not to exceed 6 months from the date hired.

                                           Chapter 6

                            PHYSICAL FITNESS STANDARDS

6.1. Mandate. After the attacks of 9/11, AF installations have been operating under sustained
anti-terrorism/force protection operations; preparing for attacks which can be both unpredictable
and catastrophic. The Air Force PAT for Civilian Applicants for Police and Security Guard
Positions standards, quantify the AF’s expectations.
6.2. PT Applicability. Successful completion of the PAT is applicable to all civilian
applicants/incumbents in the OPM occupational series 0083 (Civilian Police to include
Detectives, Combat Arms, Training, Standardization Evaluation, Armorer, Alarm Monitor,
Dispatcher, Military Working Dog (MWD) Police, Equipment/Resources and other 0083 series
positions developed in the future), 0085 (Civilian Security Guard) and 0080 (Civilian Security
Specialist with parenthetical ‘Law Enforcement’). Passing the PAT is a condition of initial and
continuous employment, similar to weapons qualification. It is a minimum requirement of the
position. PATs will be conducted on a regular recurring basis (at least annually). A pre-
participation screening/medical clearance of each individual will be conducted prior to the PAT.
The screening/medical clearance will be valid for one year, unless other health/medical issues are
identified in the interim, in which case a new clearance will be performed prior to the subsequent
PAT (see Attachment 3). The PAT serves to provide a measure of the individual’s preparedness
to successfully accomplish the essential functions of the position. A Physical Training Leader
(PTL) or specific supervisor will conduct the PAT for standardization. PTL/Supervisor will
complete Attachment 15 prior to conducting the PAT. If block 2 of Attachment 15 is marked, the
participant will be advised that they are now in a light duty status, and must follow the
procedures outlined in paragraph 2.11.4. of this instruction. Use Attachment 16 for PAT test
record.
6.3. Condition of Employment. The AF expects that civilian police and guards will be able to
fulfill a full range of activities under sometimes arduous and unforgiving conditions, performing
integrated defense tasks which may be life threatening. The physical agility standards that the
AF is implementing quantify the AF’s expectations. In order to meet the condition of
employment standard, the individual tested must successfully pass the established standard for
each of the four elements of the PAT.
6.4. Frequency. The PAT will be conducted annually and documented by the SF unit for DAF
CP/SG personnel, with a minimum of four months separating the tests. If a unit conducts all its
PATs in a single month, a new hire will not be required to complete the test again for at least 4
months (e.g. officer hired in December would not be required to test in January). Job
descriptions and performance plans/performance standards/position descriptions will contain the
PAT requirement. The PAT will be conducted no later than 12 months from the date of the last
Record PAT.
6.5. Applicant. An applicant DAF CP/SG must be advised in writing, and the Civilian
Personnel Office (CPO) will maintain a copy, at the time of the conditional offer of employment
that they are required to take the PAT within 30 days. Applicants must sign a statement
acknowledging they have been so advised (see Attachment 2). Thereafter, physical agility testing
will be required annually. For applicants, the PAT requirement must be met before the final offer
AFI31-122 22 DECEMBER 2010                                                                   47


of employment. Applicants will not be sworn in as a GS employee until they pass the PAT. All
five elements of the PAT must be accomplished at each session. Each applicant will be
authorized to take the test twice. After the second failure, the conditional job offer will be
withdrawn.
6.6. Current Incumbent. Passing the PAT is a recurring, annual requirement to maintain status
as a GS-0083/0085/0080(LE) employee. DAF CP/SG employees must pass the PAT within one
year from the date of their pre-participation clearance and AFI 31-122 publication, or local
Impact and Implementation (I & I) of the PAT policy in this publication. Thereafter, annual
physical agility testing will be required for all DAF CP/SG. In order to meet the condition of
employment standard, the individual tested must successfully pass the established standard for
the push-ups and 1.5 mile run portions of the PAT. These elements of the PAT must be
accomplished at each session. The DAF CP/SG will be authorized to take the test twice. If the
DAF CP/SG fails the second PAT, the DFC will be notified and CPO or Civilian Personnel
Flight (CPF) will be contacted for advice regarding options defined by applicable Federal and/or
agency instructions for personnel who no longer meet the minimum PAT qualifications for a
DAF CP/SG position. Incumbent DAF SG converting to CP must pass the PAT prior to initial
employment for the new position.
6.7. Duty Time Exercising. IAW AFI 36-815, Installation Commanders or heads of serviced
organizations may excuse civilian employees for physical fitness activities up to 3 hours per
week based on mission and workload requirements. When DAF CP/SG are excused,
DFCs/designated SF representative will establish a monitoring system to document a record of
member participation.
6.8. Timing. The DFC designated representative/PTL will conduct PAT testing initially and
annually for all DAF CP/SG personnel.
6.9. Standards. AF PAT standards for applicants/incumbents of 0083/0085/0080 (Law
Enforcement) positions will consist of the following:

            CIVILIAN POLICE/SECURITY GUARD CODE OF CONDUCT

7.1. Civilian Police/Security Guard Code of Conduct. No code or set of rules will specify
exactly what should be done in every situation. However, the following code provides general
guidelines.
   7.1.1. Exercising Authority. As on-duty civilian police/security guard, DAF CP/SGs are
   the visible representatives of the US Government, the Air Force, the installation commander,
   and the DFC. It is their duty to accept the authority entrusted to them and to carry out this
   important trust impartially, firmly, and in a manner that commands respect from the public.
   7.1.2. Fulfilling the Mission. The enforcement of laws and regulations dealing with
   members of the US Armed Forces brings DAF CP/SGs into direct contact with the public. In
   fulfilling the Security Force mission, DAF CP/SGs must deal with offenders in a dignified
   manner. Refrain from being disobedient, insulting, or offensive to the public.
   7.1.3. Personal Appearance. Maintain a high standard of appearance. Set the example for
   all to follow.
   7.1.4. Personal Attitudes. Perform their duties in an impartial, just, friendly, and helpful
   manner. The Air Force will not tolerate biases based on age, physical disability, race,
   religion, national origin, creed, or gender. Do not discuss offenses or incidents, except in the
   line of duty. In addition, DAF CP/SG cannot accept any advantage, gratuity, or reward for
   performing their official duties.
   7.1.5. Assistance to Others. Render assistance to the public. Promptly assist any injured or
   ill individuals.
   7.1.6. Attention to Duty. Remain mindful of duty commitments. Do not consume any
   form of intoxicant while on duty or within eight hours prior to a duty tour.
   7.1.7. Seeking Favors. Do not seek personal advantage through status. Do not try to gain
   favor or popularity by showing favoritism, overlooking violations, or otherwise failing to
   enforce the law.
   7.1.8. Punishment of Offenders. DAF CP/SG only have the authority to apprehend, based
   on reasonable grounds and do not punish offenders. DAF CP/SG use their discretion to
   correct, caution, or warn individuals for minor violations of the law, but will not admonish or
   reprimand.
   7.1.9. Apprehension of Suspects. Protect the health and welfare of all apprehended
   suspects. Use force according to AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force
   Personnel. The USAF will not tolerate the intentional mistreatment of apprehended suspects.
   Do not use abusive, profane, or insulting language toward a suspect or show disregard for the
   suspect's valuables, personal property, or physical well being.
   7.1.10. Dealing with Intoxicated Persons. Apprehend personnel obviously intoxicated
   beyond any sense of self-control or mobility. Make every effort to avoid verbal and physical
   confrontations.
 50                                                           AFI31-122 22 DECEMBER 2010


   7.1.11. Off Duty Conduct. DAF CP/SG represent the Security Forces 24 hours a day,
   regardless of duty schedule. Therefore, conduct must always remain above reproach.
7.2. Duties and Responsibilities
   7.2.1. DAF civilian police/security guard duties and responsibilities vary greatly from
   installation to installation. DFCs should define the number and limits of Security Forces
   posts, as well as assigned duties, in local duty or post instructions. The three basic duties and
   responsibilities are always the same. They are:
   7.2.2. Take charge of your post by securing and protecting personnel and property for which
   you are responsible until properly relieved. Comply with orders and instructions given.
   These responsibilities continue until relieved by proper authority.
   7.2.3. Report all violations of orders you must enforce. You have the authority to apprehend
   anyone violating those orders. Notify the appropriate control center of the apprehension and
   detain the apprehended person until assistance arrives. Written procedures cannot cover all
   situations. In such situations, you must exercise discretion and act according to your best
   judgment. Immediately contact your superior for instructions.
   7.2.4. Give the alarm in case of disorder or emergency. Report any unusual event that
   threatens the security of the installation or endangers life or property. Take reasonable
   counteraction to save life and property or lessen danger. At the same time, you must
   maintain the security of your post and remain alert for other possible violations during the
   emergency.
7.3. Forms Prescribed. None
7.4. Forms Adopted.
   7.4.1. AF Form 538, Personal Clothing and Equipment Record
   7.4.2. AF Form 55, Employee Safety and Health Record

Security Forces. These operations include active and passive defense measures, employed across
the legally-defined ground dimension of the operational environment, to mitigate potential risks
and defeat adversary threats to promote public order and efficient military operations. Law and
Order Operations directly contribute to an installation’s Integrated Defense. Law and Order
Operations encompass many special disciplines. These include crime prevention, criminal
investigations, corrections, traffic enforcement, access control and military working dogs. The
specific authorities for Law and Order Operations may depend upon jurisdictional status of the
installation which must be considered in planning for, and providing these operations.

series includes positions with the primary duty of law enforcement who work in the preservation
of peace; the prevention, detection and investigation of crimes; the arrest or apprehension of
violators; and the provision of assistance to citizens in emergency situations, including the
protection of civil rights. The purpose of police work is to ensure compliance with Federal, state,
county and municipal laws and ordinances, and agency rules and regulations pertaining to law
enforcement work. The 0080 (Law Enforcement), parenthetical designator will be used when
classifiers limit the grade levels of 0083 personnel.
Series-0083, Department of the Air Force Police Officer—This series includes positions with
the primary duty of law enforcement that work in the preservation of peace; the prevention,
detection and investigation of crimes; the arrest or apprehension of violators; and the provision

         ESSENTIAL JOB TASKS FOR DEPARTMENT OF THE AF CIVILIAN
                   POLICE/SECURITY GUARD PERSONNEL

A4.1. General Essential Functions. The examinee will possess mental, sensorial, and motor
skills as required to perform safely and effectively all essential job duties and those additional
essential functions derived from the specific job task analysis developed for each DAF CP/SG.
The specific job task analysis will be submitted to the examining physician prior to each medical
evaluation. The general essential functions include:
   A4.1.1. The ability to be stable with regard to consciousness and the control of voluntary
   motor functions, and have the functional capacity to respond appropriately to routine and
   emergency situations of the job;
   A4.1.2. The ability to maintain the mental alertness, deductive, and inductive reasoning,
   memory, and reliable judgment necessary to perform all essential functions without posing a

                                         Attachment 5
                  DAF CP/SG MEDICAL EVALUATION GUIDELINES

A5.1. These guidelines will be conducted by the considerations set forth in 5 CFR Part 339,
Medical Qualifications Determinations, and DoD Manual 6055.05M (11 November 2008) which
requires special occupational medical examinations for security police and security guards.
Listed below are some examples of medical conditions and/or physical impairments that may
interfere with the safe, efficient, and expected performance of the essential duties and
responsibilities of DAF CP/SG personnel. Prior to placement, DAF CP/SG employees will have
Optional Form 178 (OF 178), Certificate of Medical Examination, or equivalent, signed by a
military affiliated physician to identify individuals who are medically qualified for performing
the essential physical and working condition requirements of the position.
A5.2. If a disease, condition or impairment develops in a DAF CP/SG employee it is the
responsibility of the individual to notify the unit of their change in status. The unit in
coordination with the Human Resource department will then coordinate with the MRO to ensure
appropriate restrictions are in place, and schedule a Fitness For Duty determination as
appropriate per 5 CFR Part 339. The MRO may request that the individual provide additional
information/documentation from their private physician prior to signing the OF 178, Certificate
of Medical Examination, or equivalent.
A5.3. Periodic assessments will be made on DAF CP/SG employees to confirm the individual’s
ability to meet the performance-related requirements of positions covered by these guidelines. If
any condition is present that could compromise an essential job function, per Attachment 2, the
MRO will place the individual on appropriate duty restrictions until the condition has been
resolved, or a Fitness For Duty determination completed as required per 5 CFR Part 339.
A5.4. Medical Evaluation: Intent
   A5.4.1. Certify the individual is medically fit to perform the essential job functions, with or
   without reasonable accommodation, without posing a direct threat to the health or safety of
   themselves or others.
   A5.4.2. Identify any health condition that may be substantially aggravated by the job.
   A5.4.3. Evaluate an individual’s health and fitness to safely initiate or maintain a regular
   exercise program and take the Physical Fitness Test; identify individual cardiovascular risk
   factors and provide advice and assistance in controlling risk factors, including referral to the
   individual’s personal physician.
   A5.4.4. Serve as a baseline for tracking occupational health trends.
A5.5. Medical Evaluation: Frequency and Follow-up:
   A5.5.1. Medical evaluation will be completed on all Department of the Air Force Civilian
   Police and Security Guard (DAF CP/SG) personnel upon employment, periodically, and on
   termination. The offer of employment may be contingent on medical certification of the
   ability to perform the essential job functions. The initial medical evaluation will be
   accomplished during initial pre-placement evaluation of tentative selectees.
AFI31-122 22 DECEMBER 2010                                                                    63


   A5.5.2. Periodic monitoring examinations are conducted at scheduled intervals. The DAF
   CP/SG, periodic medical exmination must not exceed a three year period. Periodic
   examinations may include an interval history, a physical examination, and/or clinical and
   laboratory screening tests, as described in DoD Manual 6055.05M (11 November 2008).
   Medical evaluation may be accomplished more frequently if, in the interim, there are medical
   signs or symptoms suggestive of cardiovascular disease or another condition that might
   interfere with performance of essential job functions or at the discretion of the examining
   physician.
A5.6. Evaluation Instructions
   A5.6.1. Initial and continuing medical evaluation of DAF CP/SG will be accomplished in
   accordance with this guidance. This document will assist the examining physician in
   identifying conditions that ordinarily might be expected to interfere with one or more
   essential job functions.
   A5.6.2. Individual medical information such as hospital records, specialized tests, or an
   examination by another medical specialist may be required to determine if an individual can
   safely perform the essential functions of the job.
   A5.6.3. Periodic medical evaluation will assess interval medical history and changes in
   health that might affect the individual’s ability to perform essential job functions. It will
   follow up previously identified problems including cardiovascular risk factors and
   interventions, and evaluate for the presence of newly acquired/developed risk factors or
   relevant conditions. Except for baseline studies, such as electrocardiography, components of
   the periodic exams are essentially the same as the initial exam as described below.
   Termination exams include evaluations prompted by potential work exposures or as
   otherwise clinically indicated.
A5.7. Medical History: The medical history should cover the person’s known health problems,
such as major surgeries, illnesses, medication use, allergies, and alcohol or drug dependence,
family history, and a symptom review that might suggest early signs of illness. Attention should
be paid to findings suggestive of cardiovascular disease, such as angina pectoris or suspicious
chest discomfort, dyspnea, syncope, precordial palpitation, hypertension, a history of myocardial
infarction, and heart murmur(s). An occupational history also should be obtained to collect
information regarding the person’s past occupational and environmental exposures.
A5.8. Medical Examination: The medical exam should focus on the eyes, ears, nose, and
throat, the respiratory, musculoskeletal, and neurological systems. Attention should be paid to
signs and symptoms suggestive of inability to maintain mental alertness and control of voluntary
motor functions. Acuity of the senses, range of motion, and motor strength required to perform
essential job functions should be considered. The examination will be documented on SF 78, or
equivalent.
A5.9. Cardiovascular Risk Factors: Police and security personnel are required to respond to
emergency situations that may impose significant physical and psychological stress. Such stress
may trigger sudden death or myocardial infarction (MI) in the presence of underlying heart
disease. For this reason, cardiac risk evaluation is most appropriate.
   A5.9.1. The Framingham 10-year risk calculator is probably the most useful single tool to
   characterize the risk to a police officer or security guard of a cardiac event. The Framingham
 64                                                           AFI31-122 22 DECEMBER 2010


   Risk score uses independent risk factors (age, gender, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol,
   systolic blood pressure, treatment of hypertension, and cigarette smoking) to assess an
   individual’s absolute risk for developing a cardiac event, such as MI or new onset angina.
   A5.9.2. Generally, those individuals with a high 10-year risk, and those with coronary artery
   disease or coronary artery disease equivalent (peripheral arterial disease, abdominal aortic
   aneurysm, symptomatic carotid artery disease, diabetes) are candidates for additional testing
   (usually a treadmill stress test, stress thallium, or stress echo). The medical review officer
   should consider temporarily disqualifying these individuals from strenuous duties and/or
   duties that require wearing a respirator (except a mask for escape purposes only), pending the
   results of evaluation by the workers’ private physician.
A5.10. Diabetes: Fasting blood sugar should be obtained because diabetes mellitus frequently
can interfere with safe performance of essential police/ guard functions, such patients should be
carefully evaluated. The examinee should have a history of being under excellent control for an
extended period of time, with a glycosylated hemoglobin less than 8.0. The examinee should
have a history of an absence of end organ damage (nephropathy, neuropathy, proliferative
retinopathy), an absence of uncontrolled hypertension, and no history of ketoacidosis,
hyperosmolar nonketotic coma, nor severe hypoglycemia in the previous year.
A5.11. Lipids: Serum cholesterol, high density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein, and
triglycerides should be evaluated for cardiovascular risk and referral to the individual’s private
physician when intervention is indicated.
A5.12. Arrythmias: Arrythmias that predispose to or have a risk of cerebral hypoperfusion and
impaired consciousness are generally not compatible with safe performance of the duties of
police and security personnel. Security Force personnel with pacemakers may be qualified if the
underlying disease does not pose a significant risk; they should be evaluated on a case-by-case
basis. Implanted defibrillators are generally not compatible with safe performance of the duties
of police and security personnel. The pre-placement exam should include a resting
electrocardiogram (ECG) for initial evaluation and then as clinically indicated thereafter.
A5.13. Hypertension: Blood pressure (the average of at least two independent measurements
taken after 15 minutes of rest) should be used in evaluating cardiovascular risk. The individual
will be referred to their private physician when intervention is indicated.
A5.14. Hearing: DAF CP/SG personnel will require pre-placement audiogram to determine if
they can safely perform their duties. Audiomety testing is conducted using audiometers (manual
or microprocessor) calibrated to the current ANSI S3.6 standards. Pure tone unaided air
conduction hearing threshold levels should not exceed 30 dB hearing loss (HL) on average for
each ear at 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz, with no level greater than 35 dB HL at these frequencies;
and thresholds should not exceed 55 dB at 4000 Hz in each ear. If the hearing is worse than
these thresholds, it is questionable whether or not that individual can function as a police/guard.
If one ear is deaf or has extremely poor hearing, it is likely the individual would be unable to
safely perform DAF CP/SG duties.
   A5.14.1. Field “use” tests are neither as reliable nor valid as the speech-in-noise test used by
   the audiologist. Speech-based “use” tests invoke a large number of variables such as the
   content of the message, context, accent, background noise, and so forth. The speech-in-noise
AFI31-122 22 DECEMBER 2010                                                                     65


   test controls for these factors. The "Whispered Voice Test" is no longer valid and should not
   be accepted by medical professionals.
   A5.14.2. DAF CP/SG personnel identified as being occupationally exposed to noise levels
   requiring placement in the Hearing Conservation Program, will undergo initial, annual, and
   termination audiometric evaluation as required in AFOSH 48-20.
A5.15. Vision: Screening may be performed by the examining physician if they have the
capability to perform these tests; optometry referral is not required unless indicated by poor
vision or an inability to properly assess the vision. When an examinee’s vision is worse than
indicated below, it is likely the individual will not be able to safely perform the essential job
functions; the examining physician should consider this in his/her assessment. Individual
limitations will be determined on a case-by-case basis.
   A5.15.1. Using the individual’s best optical correction, distance vision should be at least
   20/30 in one eye and 20/100 in the other, or 20/40 in one eye and 20/70 in the other, and near
   vision should be correctable to 20/40 binocularly (both eyes open). Uncorrected binocular
   visual acuity should be at least 20/100. Successful soft contact lens wearers will not be
   limited to any uncorrected distance standard as long as they can be corrected to the standards
   listed above. Personnel wearing soft contact lenses should provide evidence from their eye
   care professional affirming their successful use of soft contact lenses.
   A5.15.2. Individuals should be able to discriminate vivid red/green color.
   A5.15.3. Individuals should have normal muscle balance, defined as the lack of strabismus
   (greater than 15 diopters), nystagmus, and diplopia.
   A5.15.4. Additionally, individuals should have at least a total horizontal visual field of 120
   degrees and at least a total vertical visual field of 40 degrees (20 above the horizontal
   meridian and 20 below the horizontal meridian) in each eye.
   A5.15.5. Individuals should not have a history of abnormal night vision.
A5.16. Respirators: Individuals who are required to wear a respirator must be medically cleared
to wear/use a respirator. Medical clearance for respirator use must be in accordance with current
applicable guidance on the AFOSH 48-137 Respiratory Protection Program.
A5.17. Immunizations: Agencies may establish periodic immunization programs by written
policies or directives to safeguard the health of employees whose work may subject them or
others to significant health or safety risks due to occupational or environmental exposure or
demands. A review of DAF CP/SG immunization status will be made to ensure members have
received tetanus, PPD, hepatitis B, and other appropriate immunizations.
A5.18. Psychiatric: A history or diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, which could affect safe
and efficient job performance, require additional evaluation to determine whether the individual
is able to safely and successfully perform the essential job functions. The presence of any of the
following specific psychiatric disorders, or a history of such, warrants further evaluation by a
psychologist or psychiatrist before a DAF CP/SG is deemed fit for duty. Other psychiatric
disorders not listed here also may warrant further evaluation. A particular diagnosis need not
necessarily have previously been made; rather if there appears to be signs associated with any of
the listed diagnoses, this may warrant further evaluation:
   A5.18.1. Delirium, dementia, and amnestic and other cognitive disorders
66                                                          AFI31-122 22 DECEMBER 2010


  A5.18.2. Major depressive disorder
  A5.18.3. Manic-depressive disorder (bipolar)
  A5.18.4. Dissociative disorders
  A5.18.5. Kleptomania
  A5.18.6. Panic disorder and other anxiety disorders (depending upon etiology, duration and
  severity of clinical expression)
  A5.18.7. Pyromania
  A5.18.8. Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders
  A5.18.9. Personality disorders
  A5.18.10. Alcohol or drug dependence
  A5.18.11. Neurological: A history of chronic headaches, head trauma, cranial defects, and
  epilepsy are among the neurological disorders that can interfere with DAF CP/SG
  functioning. Epilepsy can be particularly dangerous, and the likelihood of an on-the-job
  seizure must be assessed. To evaluate this risk, the recommended method is described in the
  Medical Screening Manual for California Law Enforcement, pages IX–3 through IX–12,
  available at www.post.ca.gov/selection/medical.asp. In such cases, the physician should
  assess non-seizure related impairments, such as interictal EEG discharges (which can cause
  transient cognitive impairment) or anti-epileptic drug side effects (about 30% of patients may
  experience moderate to severe side effects to include cognitive impairment, visual effects,
  and ataxia)
AFI31-122 22 DECEMBER 2010                                                                      67

      AIR FORCE CONTINUED SERVICE AGREEMENT (CSA) FOR CIVILIAN
                            EMPLOYEES

A6.1. I agree that upon completion of the Air Force sponsored training described below, I will
work for the US Air Force (see AFI 36-401, Chapter 4, for CSA requirements), in accordance
with the US Air Force CSA policy. (The length of full-time training is 8 hours for each day of
training, up to a maximum of 40 hours a week.) I understand that if I voluntarily enter a period of
non-pay status during the period of service obligation (e.g., LWOP to accompany a spouse
moving to a new duty location), the period of obligated service may be extended by length of
time in a non-pay status.
A6.2. If I voluntarily leave the Air Force before completing the period of service shown in item
7 below, I AGREE to reimburse the Air Force for the tuition, travel, per diem, books, materials,
fees, administrative overhead costs, and other related expenses (EXCLUDING SALARY) paid
in connection with my training as shown in item 8 below. However, the amount of the
reimbursement will be reduced on a pro-rated basis for the percentage of completion of the
obligated service. (For example, if the cost of training is $3,000 and I complete two-thirds of the
obligated service, I will reimburse the Air Force $1,000 instead of the original $3,000.)
A6.3. I FURTHER AGREE that if I voluntarily leave the Air Force to enter the service of
another Federal agency or other organization in any branch of the government before completing
the period of service agreed to in item 7 below, I will give my servicing civilian personnel office
written notice of at least 10 workdays, during which time a determination concerning
reimbursement will be made. If I fail to give this advance notice, I AGREE to pay the amount of
additional expenses (Title 5 U.S.C. 4109(a) (2)) incurred by the government in this training.
A6.4. I understand that any amounts which may be due the Air Force as a result of any failure
on my part to meet the terms of this agreement may be withheld from any monies owed me by
the government, or may be recovered by such other methods as are approved by law.
A6.5. I FURTHER AGREE to obtain approval from the employee development manager
responsible for authorizing training requests of any proposed change in my approved training
program involving course and schedule changes, withdrawals or in-completions, and increased
costs. If I fail to complete Air Force sponsored training I AGREE to reimburse the Air Force
training and related costs as in item 8 below.
A6.6. I acknowledge that this agreement does not in any way commit the government to
continue my employment. I understand that if there is a transfer of my service obligation to
another Federal agency or other organization in any branch of the government, the agreements in
items A6.1., A6.2., and A6.3. of this section will remain in effect until I have completed my
obligated service with that other agency or organization.

NOTES:
(All notes apply)
1. The items listed represent common appearance issues and are not all-inclusive.
2. Commanders do not have the authority to waive appearance and grooming standards except as
identified.
3. Installation commanders will determine what is extreme or faddish. The installation commander
may delegate this authority to subordinate commanders to the squadron commander level.
4. If due to a temporary medical condition (i.e., radiation/chemotherapy and resulting in baldness),
commanders will authorize wear of the American Cancer Society-approved cap (black/tan).
5. (Women) Will not apply designs to nails or apply two-tone or multi-tone colors on duty
excluding French manicure.
6. (Women) Medical waivers are required for situations that require baldness as a medical
necessity while in uniform.
7. The intent of this item is that long hair should be styled in a manner that prevents loose ends
from extending upward on the head. (For example: when using the claw clip or hairpins, hair will
not present the appearance of a rooster tail; when hair is in a bun, all loose ends must be tucked in
and secured; when hair is in a pony tail, it must be pulled all the way through the elastic band and
may hang naturally downward, not extending below the bottom of the collar). As with all
hairstyles, a neat and professional image is essential.

                    ACADEMY TRAINING WAIVER INSTRUCTIONS

A10.1. The Evaluator (Security Forces Squadron Training Superintendent or designee) will
examine copies of the Waiver Applicant’s diploma(s), curriculum or training list, and/or a
student transcript from the Federal or state certified academy and include them as a permanent
part of the applicant’s training record. A graduation certificate alone will not satisfy the
information requirements to complete this evaluation. A task breakdown with each subject of
the complete curriculum is required to compare with the Air Force Civilian Police and Security
Guard Training List requirements (See Attachment 11 for minimum training requirements). The
DAF CP/SG CFETP can also be used to enhance the minimum training requirements.
A10.2. The AF Civilian Police / Security Guard Training List consist of 106 subject areas. Each
subject area contains one learning objective that breaks down into one or more Training Tasks to
be learned by the student. The evaluator should qualify or disqualify the waiver applicant’s past
training, education and experience by cross-referencing it to the Air Force’s Training List.
Compare what tasks were taught in a previously-attended academy or course to the Training List
of the AF Civilian Police and Security Guards. (See Attachment 11)
A10.3. There is a wide range of certification requirements throughout the United States law
enforcement community. This review process is largely subjective, but should be evaluated and
documented consistently. During the evaluation, make cross-reference notes so the results can
be recreated, if necessary. The evaluator need only be reasonable during this process. Exact
matches will seldom be possible because of terminology differences. Reasonable discretion is
defensible. In cases that cannot be settled without technical policy guidance, the unit
commander shall be the determining authority. This evaluation process must be documented and
archived as a permanent part of the CP/SG’s personnel record to document compliance with AFI
36-2225.
A10.4. Former DoD Law Enforcement
   A10.4.1. Determine if the Waiver Applicant is qualified for a waiver on the basis of past
   service as a Military Policeman, Master-at-Arms, or Security Forces veteran, or service in
   another DoD agency. Retain a copy of all documents used to determine qualifications, such
   as a DD-214, SF-50’s, transcripts, etc. Ensure the Waiver Applicant receives all required
   home-station training if otherwise qualified for the waiver.
A10.5. Former Civilian Police Officers / Security Guards (Federal, State, Municipal, DoD
Contract)
   A10.5.1. Determine if the Waiver Applicant is qualified for a waiver on the basis of past
   service as a civilian peace officer or security guard, with qualifying training from a federal or
   state certified training program, (See Attachment 11).
   A10.5.2. If the Training Tasks in the DAF Civilian Police/Security Guard Training List were
   reasonably completed by the Waiver Applicant in another Federal or state certified training
   program, he or she may receive a training waiver. The DFC has discretion to send the
   Waiver Applicant to an approved training academy. The DFC may authorize the Waiver
   Applicant to complete an in-house training program if necessary Military Specific Subjects in
   Attachment 9 and home station subjects, using HQ AFSFC/SFOT training materials,

  followed by a resident field training program that meets installation-specific law enforcement
  and security requirements. All waived training requirements must be documented on the
  individual’s AF Form 623 and Civilian Police and Security Guard Training List Waiver /
  Matrix (Attachment 11).

QUALIFICATION REVIEW BOARD FOR EMPLOYEES OF DAF CIVILIAN POLICE
              AND SECURITY GUARD (CP/SG) POSITIONS

A12.1. Organization: The Security Forces Qualifications Review Board (SF-QRB) is
established to review cases for incumbent officers who meet the full range of duties contained
within their Position Description (e.g., the PAT), but cannot meet the established medical
standards (e.g., color blind in one eye). The SF-QRB is an appeals board for incumbents with
permanent or long term medical conditions that fall outside of the scope of light duty. The SF-
QRB will also consider issues that are not strictly medical (e.g., reasonable accommodation
and/or assessment of undue hardship on the Air Force security operations) and issues that are
legal (i.e., application of the Rehabilitation Act/ADA with respect to reasonable
accommodation). The HQ AFSFC Commander will appoint the members of the SF-QRB. The
SF-QRB will consist of: AFSFC Deputy Director; AFSFC Operations Division Chief (or
Deputy); and Programs and Resources Division Chief (or Deputy). The SF-QRB may also
include a MAJCOM Director of Security Forces (or Deputy). HQ AFRC/A7S will have a
member on the SF-QRB when a DAF CP/SG assigned to AFRC is being evaluated for continued
employment. A legal advisor from the Secretary of Air Force General Counsel’s Administrative
Law Division (SAF/GCA) or local legal office (installation level) will provide legal advice to the
SF-QRB. AF/SG or a local Medical Review Officer (MRO) will support the board to make
medical standard qualification/disqualification recommendations. A representative from the
civilian personnel community (installation level or AFPC) may also serve as advisor. The
AFSFC Deputy Director will serve as the SF-QRB Chair. The SF-QRB may operate virtually or
physically.
A12.2. Waiver process: The waiver process applies to employees who receive a determination
of “Not Medically Qualified”. The local MRO shall inform all employees of the results of their
occupational medical examinations as soon as possible following completion of the examination.
Waivers will not be considered for employees who have a permanent or long term medical
disqualification unless they can provide objective medical documentation that demonstrates that
they can perform the essential functions of the position with or without reasonable
accommodation. Waivers for those employees having “temporary” medical conditions are
handled through light duty policy. Once the employee chooses to appeal, he/she will submit the
appeal request through their commander. The commander will contact the local MRO who
determines which medical specialist (e.g., Endocrinologist, Internist) should be consulted, and
what additional information is required. The individual will be informed that this additional
medical information will be at their expense. After the specialist completes the evaluation that
will provide the additional data required, the specialist will send the information to the MRO.
The MRO reviews the specialist’s recommendation and determines if the officer is/is not
medically qualified based upon the additional information. If the individual remains disqualified,
and chooses to continue with the appeal (Official Request for Waiver)--the local MRO will send
documentation on the results of the occupational medical examination, the specialist’s
information and, if appropriate, information regarding potential reasonable accommodations
and/or restrictions to a doctor at Lackland AFB, who will review the package in coordination
with SJA and HR, as the Qualification Review Board (QRB) at the AFSFC (contact HQ AFSFC
 90                                                          AFI31-122 22 DECEMBER 2010


for details). The QRB can choose to send their recommendation to a specialist at the Air Staff
who can provide additional consultation on the determination. The SF-QRB’s appeal
recommendation will be sent to the AFSFC/CC who will make the final QRB determination.
Protected health information shall only be viewed by qualified healthcare representatives of
management with a need to know. Submit the request in time to arrive at the office of the
AFSFC Deputy Director within 20 calendar days of the employees’ written request for a waiver.
Requests may be in paper form, via fax, or electronic. Confirmation records of facsimile and/or
electronic delivery (read-receipt) must be maintained by the individual requesting the waiver, in
the event a timeliness issue arises.
   A12.2.1. The request for a waiver must, at a minimum, contain:
   A12.2.2. Date of request for a waiver.
   A12.2.3. Name and contact information.
   A12.2.4. Unit of assignment and supervisor’s name.
   A12.2.5. Rationale explaining why he/she is not medically qualified. If employee has
   veteran’s preference as a disabled veteran, the VA rating decision form must be submitted. If
   medical information is included, a request for a release of medical information may be
   requested by the SF-QRB.
   A12.2.6. Requested action and/or proposals for reasonable accommodation.
A12.3. Convene the SF-QRB: The AFSFC Deputy Director will convene an SF-QRB within
30 calendar days, or as soon thereafter as practical, of receiving the request for a waiver.
Requesters will not normally be permitted to appear in person before the SF-QRB. However, as
indicated above, they can communicate to the SF-QRB any information that they believe is
relevant. If the SF-QRB has any questions or concerns upon review of the submitted material,
the Chair will make arrangements for the requestor to address those areas either in writing, by
telephone and/or video conference.
   A12.3.1. SF-QRB Recommendation: In matters heard by the SF-QRB, the board will issue a
   recommendation under the Chair’s signature to AFSFC/CC. The AFSFC Commander retains
   the authority to review and modify any SF-QRB recommendation. The decision of the
   AFSFC Commander will constitute the final official agency decision. Agency decisions will
   be issued within 60 calendar days of the meeting of the SF-QRB. The AFSFC Commander
   will forward the determination to the unit commander for the final disposition.
   A12.3.2. Notification to employees: The employee’s supervisor will be responsible for
   informing the employee who requested the waiver of the outcome of the QRB. If the
   employee is represented by counsel, the legal counsel who participated in the meeting will
   participate in any explanatory discussions at which employee is present. The procedures used
   by the SF-QRB will be developed in a separate standard operating instruction.

                     PAT PROCEDURES AND ORDER OF TESTING

A14.1. Vertical jump test. After a 10 minute warm up, successfully jump 16.5” with the
Vertec Jump Measurement System or yard stick, followed by a 10 minute break.
   A14.1.1. The vertical jump demonstrates explosive leg power which is used in self defense
   and high intensity arrest or detention simulation training. Further, this is important for
   performing tasks involving the use of force.
   A14.1.2. When using the Vertec jump measurement system, start by standing under the
   apparatus and reaching one hand (hand nearest the apparatus) as high as possible, placing the
   bicep against the ear; the stack of movable tabs will be moved to a point immediately above
   the tips of the fingers. Member steps back with either foot, then steps forward and jumps as
   high as possible and strikes the tabs or the member may jump with both feet and not take a
   step. The best of three attempts is scored to the nearest half inch.
   A14.1.3. The vertical jump may also be conducted with a yard stick attached to a wall. It
   may be easier for the test proctor to conduct the test while standing on a chair opposite the
   yardstick on the wall; this will allow a clear view of the numbers on the yardstick. A half step
   away from the wall is taken so that the member cannot use the wall to gain leverage to assist
   them in the jump.
   A14.1.4. The test starts with the member standing straight and tall with one side of their
   body flush against the wall from the outside of the ankle to the tip of the fingers at the end of
   the same side arm stretched over head. Place the palm of the hand and fingers (hand nearest
   the wall) flat against the yardstick. Record the number reached on the yardstick to the
   nearest half inch.
   A14.1.5. The member then takes half a step away from the wall to begin the test. The
   member steps back with either foot, steps forward and then jumps as high as possible and
   touches the yardstick (with hand nearest the wall) or the member may jump with both feet
   and not take a step back. The best of three attempts is scored to the nearest half inch. Test is
   terminated when both feet are back on floor.
   A14.1.6. The vertical jump is calculated by subtracting the reaching height from the jumping
   height and is expressed to the nearest half inch.
A14.2. Illinois Agility Run. Successfully complete the course in 18.1 seconds, followed by a
10 minute break.
   A14.2.1. The Illinois Agility Run demonstrates the coordinated movement and speed
   necessary to successfully move around objects and people, for instance, in a foot pursuit.
   A14.2.2. Illinois agility run course: Use a straight line, as on a court or a track as the
   start/finish line; place one cone on the line, then place three more cones on a straight line 10
   feet apart for a total of 30 feet. The width will be 20 feet, 10 feet to either side of the line of
   cones. (See A14.2.3. below).
   A14.2.3. Illinois Agility Run Description
 94                                                             AFI31-122 22 DECEMBER 2010




   A14.2.4. Member lies on the ground with fingertips behind the start line. At the 'Go'
   command, member gets up, sprints to the far line (30' away), places one foot over the line,
   then sprints back to the start line. Member then makes a left turn around the first cone then
   zig-zags in a figure 8 fashion around four cones, 10' apart on a straight line, then zig zags
   back to the start line. Member then turns left at the first cone, sprints up to the far line, places
   one foot over the line and sprints back across the finish line. Member should be provided
   instructions throughout the test: “Go. Sprint up to the line. Place one foot over the line, turn
   around and sprint back. Go around the bottom cone. Slalom up through the cones, go around
   the top cone; slalom back down through the cones. Go around the bottom cone. Sprint up to
   the line; place one foot over the line; sprint back. Run through the finish line.” Score is timed
   in seconds and tenths. Allow one walk through, and two practice runs. When ready, conduct
   two trials and score is the best (lowest) time.
A14.3. 300 meter run. Complete the distance in 66 seconds or less; followed by a 10 minute
break.
   A14.3.1. Demonstrates anaerobic capacity used in high intensity baton and defensive tactics
   training, and is important for performing short, intense bursts of effort such as foot pursuits,
   rescues and use of force situations.
   A14.3.2. At the starting line, on a flat surface, run 300 meters as quickly as possible.
   Participants will start at the direction of the timer and be recorded with a stopwatch to the
   nearest second.
A14.4. Pushups. Execute 32 pushups with no time limit, followed by a 30 minute break.
   A14.4.1. Demonstrates a measure of the muscular endurance of the upper body (chest,
   shoulders and triceps). This is an important area for many tasks involving use of force,
   lifting, carrying and pushing.
AFI31-122 22 DECEMBER 2010                                                                       95


   A14.4.2. The Participant starts in the front leaning position. Hands are slightly more than
   shoulder width apart; feet are 12” apart or less. The participant lowers self until the upper
   arms are parallel to the ground then pushes up again. When an individual does not have arms
   parallel to the ground, the pushup does not count and the proctor will repeat the same count
   again. The back must be kept straight throughout the exercise. If participant stops to rest, the
   rest position will be arms fully extended, back straight. The test ends when the participant
   states they are finished or (i.e., when the individual fails to maintain proper rest position,
   stands up, knee(s) touch the ground, etc).
A14.5. 1. 5 Mile Run. Run 1.5 miles in 16 minutes, 17 seconds (16:17), followed by a cool
down period.
   A14.5.1. To demonstrate cardio-respiratory endurance (or aerobic capacity) used in extended
   control and defensive tactics training. This is important for performing tasks involving
   stamina and endurance (e.g., pursuits, searches, prolonged use of force situations, etc) and for
   minimizing the risk of cardiovascular health problems.
   A14.5.2. At the starting line, on a flat surface, run or walk 1.5 miles as quickly as possible.
   Participants will start at the direction of the timer who will measure the time with a
   stopwatch and record the result to the nearest second.
   A14.5.3. Altitude Adjustments. For geographical areas that vary in altitude, altitude
   adjustments will be made for the 1.5 mile run. At an altitude of 5000 feet, a 30 second time
   adjustment is made. An additional 10 seconds will be added for every subsequent 1,000 feet
   of altitude up to 8,000 feet (for a total of 60 seconds). At 9,000 feet in altitude the time
   increases by an additional 15 seconds (to 75 seconds total). The time adjusts by 15 seconds
   for every subsequent 1,000 ft up to 12,000 ft (120 seconds total). For example, at 5,000 feet
   the time criteria will be 16:47 min vs. 16:17 below 5,000 ft. An altitude adjustment is not
   required for the other test items as they are not aerobic in nature and therefore not affected by
   the different altitude levels.
A14.6. Cool-down. Typical cool-down for 5 minutes should include walking and stretches of
the muscles that were used until heart rate returns to less than 100 beats per minute (BPM) and
heavy sweating stops. To determine BPM, place finger (s) on inside of wrist feeling pulse and
take the count for 1 minute.
A14.7. Physical Readiness (Job Task Scenario) Appeals Test. The Physical Readiness
Appeals Test is for incumbents who fail the second exercise battery PAT and request to appeal
the result. This test will be conducted at VA-LETC, a single and unbiased location, and funded
by the requesting MAJCOM or unit. The incumbent will be scheduled to arrive the day before
the test and depart the evening of the test day. If the test is requested to be performed at a
different location, the request must be approved by the CFM. The incumbent must bring to the
test a current medical clearance/screening and a completed Attachment 15 signed by their
supervisor. When the Physical Readiness Appeals Test is performed, the incumbent must
successfully complete each of the three scenarios within the required time. This test will be given
the third Wednesday of the month. The proctor will use Attachment 17 to record the results of
the test and may re-accomplish Attachment 15. The appeals test is not provided to applicants.
   A14.7.1. Procedures/Order of testing
96                                                             AFI31-122 22 DECEMBER 2010


  A14.7.1.1. General. The appeals test will be given as a unit in one period of time. There
  will be a break of no more than an hour, and no less than 40 minutes between each scenario.
  The individual being tested will not be debriefed as to his passing score of an individual test
  until the end of the session. An individual will be given only three scenario tests (i.e., no
  retest) unless there are very unusual circumstances beyond the control of the test proctors
  (e.g., lightening in the area). If a test proctor determines that the person taking the test is not
  operating in a proper manner (e.g., mishandling weapons, running during the patrol walk) the
  proctors may stop the scenario being tested and restart the same scenario from the beginning
  with no time penalty. Attachment 15 will be completed at the base. Test results will be
  maintained on the form in Attachment 17.
  A14.7.2. Warm-up. Typical warm-up for 3 minutes should include slow jogging-in-place
  or walking in place and slow joint rotation exercises (e.g., arm circles, knee/ankle rotations)
  to gradually increase the joints’ range of motion, and slow, static stretching of the muscles to
  be used during the upcoming activity.
  A14.7.3. Scenario #1 (Gate Detail), read this script: “In the first scenario, you report to
  your duty station at the main gate to the base immediately before the start of the morning
  rush hour. There is a disabled vehicle in one lane of traffic; bollards and cones have to be
  quickly put in place after the vehicle is pushed out of the way for safety. The scenario starts
  with you standing (in a simulated gate building). Watch this demonstration.” (See Figure
  A14.2., Gate Detail Description)
  A14.7.4. Execute Scenario #1: Member starts in a standing position, on a flat asphalt
  course. On the command go, exit the shack, run 15 feet to the rear of the (disabled) vehicle
  (vehicle: front wheel drive, curb weight of 3500 lbs +/- 10%, one person in the vehicle, in the
  driver’s seat), push the vehicle 35 feet to the side. Immediately move 50 feet to a rack of
  (simulated) bollards (nylon sacks with handles, loaded with 50 lbs of sand). Pick up one
  bollard, run 45 feet and place the bollard in position. Run back, retrieve another bollard, run
  50 feet and place the bollard in position. Return to the rack a third time, pick up a bollard, run
  55 feet and place the bollard in position. Move quickly 50 feet to a pile of cones, pick up five
  (5) large cones, walk 30 feet, place the cones in a straight line, creating a lane of traffic for
  entrance onto the base. Time stops. Complete the Gate Detail scenario in 125 seconds or
  less.
  A14.7.5. Scenario #2 (Tactical Response), read this script: “In the second scenario, you
  are on routine patrol and receive a call of a shooting in a base building. There are casualties
  (a 160 lb dummy) and the shooter is actively moving through the building. You must
  overcome the threats as quickly and efficiently as possible. Please keep in mind the emphasis
  in this scenario is on physical ability, not specific techniques or tactics. The scenario starts
  with you seated and seat belted in position in a vehicle. Watch this demonstration. On the
  command go, exit the vehicle and move to the rear of the vehicle. Don your protective gear
  (i.e., helmet, vest, gas mask, etc) stored in the trunk while maintaining a position of cover.
  Run 75 feet, maintaining a crouch position to simulate cover to the entrance of the building.
  Immediately enter the stairwell and climb two (2) flights of stairs. Tactically enter the
  hallway and run 30 feet to a down officer (the dummy 160 lbs), drag the officer 30 feet back
  to the stairwell. Run 40 feet to a classroom/office, enter the room visually inspect the room,
  exit the room, run 30 feet to the next room, enter the room, engage the shooter with verbal
  commands. Time stops.”
AFI31-122 22 DECEMBER 2010                                                                      97


  A14.7.6. Execute Scenario #2: Member starts from a seated and seat-belted position:
  Scenario begins seated in vehicle. On the command ‘Go’, exit the vehicle and move to the
  rear of the vehicle. Don protective gear (i.e., helmet, vest, gas mask, etc) stored in the trunk
  while maintaining a position of cover. Run 75’ maintaining a crouch position to simulate
  cover to the building entrance. Immediately enter stairwell and climb two (2) flights of stairs.
  Tactically enter the hallway and run 30 feet to a downed officer (dummy, commercially
  available, weighing 160 lbs – the weight may need to be adjusted with a vest secured to the
  trunk of the dummy; dummy should be clothed in a jumpsuit with extraction loop), drag the
  officer 30 feet back to the stairwell. Run 40 feet to a classroom/office; enter the room,
  visually inspect the area. Exit the room, run 30 feet to the next room, engage the shooter with
  verbal commands. Time stops. Complete the Tactical Response scenario in 140 seconds or
  less.
  A14.7.7. Scenario # 3 (Chase and Restrain Subject): read this script: “In the third and
  final scenario, you are charged with controlling a disturbance when one of the members
  involved runs from the scene. You must pursue and restrain the subject. The various
  obstacles are simulations of barriers or obstacles you may need to surmount in a pursuit
  situation. You will begin the scenario here. Watch this demonstration. Begin walking 400
  meters at a deliberate pace as if on patrol. At the end of the walk (point to cone) you get a
  call to respond to a nearby dormitory; run 262 feet (indicate cones demarking distance). Go
  around three cones (identify the cones), run 30 feet to the simulated drainage ditch (four
  cones spaced four feet apart in a square), jump the ditch and run 45 feet to the dormitory
  entrance. Enter the stairwell, run up one flight of stairs, exit the stairwell, run 45 feet, turn
  around, run back to the stairwell, run up one more flight of stairs. Exit the stairwell, run 30
  feet to engage the subjects, issue a verbal command, step to the side, withdraw your baton
  and deploy the baton. Strike the impact bag with two forehand strikes, step to the side and
  execute two backhand strikes. Run 30 feet back to the stairs, run down two flights of stairs,
  exit the building. Run 45 feet to the simulated four foot ditch, jump the ditch (point to the
  cones), run 75 feet through these cones (point out cones and direction to run). Go to the
  ground to simulate being struck or falling to the ground. Recover. Roll the dummy forward
  four times (four half turns – front to back) and roll the dummy back four times. Bring the
  dummy’s hands together to simulate prone handcuffing. Time stops. ”
  A14.7.8. Execute Scenario #3: Member is positioned outdoors at the start of the 400m
  walk. Scenario begins standing at a cone. On the command ‘Go’, begin walking 400 meters
  at a deliberate pace. At the end of the walk you get a call to respond to a nearby dormitory
  building. Run 262 feet. Run around three simulated vehicles (three cones simulate the
  vehicles), run 30 feet to simulated drainage ditch. Jump over the 4 foot simulated ditch and
  run 45 feet to the dormitory entrance. Enter the stairwell, run up one flight of stairs. Exit the
  stairwell, run 45 feet, turn around, run back to the stairwell, run up one more flight of stairs.
  Exit the stairwell, run 30 feet to engage the multiple subjects involved in an altercation. Issue
  verbal command, step to the side, withdraw your baton and deploy the baton. Issue a verbal
  command, execute two (2) forehand strikes to the impact bag, step to the side and execute
  two (2) backhand strikes to the impact bag. One of the other subjects runs for the stairs. Run
  30 feet back to the stairs, run down two flights of stairs, exit the building. Run 45 feet, jump
  the 4 foot ditch, run 75 feet dodging four (4) obstacles (four cones spaced 15 feet apart). Go
  to the ground to simulate being struck or falling to the ground. Roll the dummy
