                                                Chapter 1

                                            INTRODUCTION

1.1. Introduction. This instruction provides guidance, procedures, and responsibilities for AFMC Depot
Maintenance Work Measurement, which addresses: labor classification; development, maintenance, and
use of direct labor methods and standards; indirect labor factors; labor efficiency factors; and Shop Flow
Days (SFD). It also covers procedures to ensure these written practices are consistently followed. The
program stresses integrity, reliability, and accuracy of labor methods and standards.

1.2. Purpose. The purpose of work measurement in the depots is to meet the requirements of both exter-
nal and internal customers.
    1.2.1. External Customers. Labor standards are used as a basis for costs required to perform indi-
    vidual work orders. Labor standards must accurately reflect labor required to do any particular job.
    Labor standards are used to establish production schedules, and they have a direct bearing on the
    length of the repair cycle that is portrayed to the customer. Labor standards are used to calculate stan-
    dard SFD. They also have a direct bearing on quantities of spares purchased by the item managers.
    Spares can be a significant cost to external customers.
    1.2.2. Internal Customers. Work measurement documentation provides the means to benchmark
    organization work performance. Labor standards are the projected times by which management can
    effectively evaluate actual organization work performance. Labor standards, operation descriptions,
    and associated times provide data for analysis that enable the repair process owners to identify prime
    areas for process improvement. Standards are used in scheduling, budgeting, sales rates, manpower
    requirements, and shop capacity. Standard SFD are used to calculate floating stock, where applicable.
    1.2.3. The technique selected to conduct a work measurement study will be based on a positive return
    on investment. The anticipated savings should exceed the cost of measurement.
    1.2.4. The information obtained from work measurement studies or analysis will be used to evaluate
    organizational performance.
    1.2.5. For consistency of application within the AFMC depots, tools, techniques, and management
    data associated with work measurement will be shared.

1.3. Responsibilities.
    1.3.1. The Depot Maintenance Operations Division (HQ AFMC/A4D) will formulate and administer
    policy guidance for AFMC depot work measurement. HQ AFMC/A4D will serve as the command
    representative on depot work measurement issues or matters requiring coordination with other agen-
    cies and services, or the DOD as required.
    1.3.2. Each center Maintenance Wing will:
       1.3.2.1. Adhere to the techniques and methods illustrated in the Work Measurement policy.
       1.3.2.2. Be the central focal point for administering work measurement. Coordinate on all Indus-
       trial Engineering Technician training and reporting requirements, interpret policy guidance, and
       provide functional support.
AFMCI21-105 30 APRIL 2008                                                                               5


   1.3.3. Each center Maintenance Group will review labor standards on an event driven basis as shown
   in paragraph 3.4.1.

1.4. Definitions. AFMC depot maintenance work measurement will use standard industrial engineering
terminology and definitions. A comprehensive "Glossary of Terms" is available in the Standardization of
Work Measurement, DoD 5010.15.1-M, basic volume, appendix IV, and serves as the source and docu-
mentation for AFMC Work Measurement definitions. Any variance in terminology or definitions for
applicable industrial engineering terms will be addressed in writing to HQ AFMC/A4D for consideration
and approval.

1.5. Training and Qualifications. Journeyman Industrial Engineering Technicians must be qualified in
their job series. Each planning organization will ensure the completion of proper work measurement train-
ing and related career development of personnel assigned to work measurement activities. These person-
nel will be afforded development opportunities through a planned program of training, continuing
education, work assignments, and professional and technical activities. Refresher training should be given
as required. Specific training requirements are included in Attachment 2.

1.6. References. Organizations responsible for developing labor standards or managing AFMC Depot
Maintenance Work Measurement will utilize readily accessible references via the internet. Recommended
references are shown in Attachment 1.

                                      LABOR CLASSIFICATION

2.1. General.
    2.1.1. The qualifying criteria for labor as described in this instruction is that the job being performed,
    whether it is classified as direct or indirect, must be paid for by the DMAG. This instruction does not
    apply to jobs falling outside this criterion. Throughout the remainder of this instruction, labor paid for
    by the DMAG shall be referred to as maintenance labor.
    2.1.2. The prescribing regulation for labor classification is DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 11B, Chapter 13.
    The purpose of this chapter is to assist in applying the regulation.
    2.1.3. Proper classification of maintenance labor is an aid to managers at all levels. It is a tool for
    achieving the most effective and economical utilization of human resources when combined with
    accurate reporting of workers' time spent on assigned tasks. It is also a tool for evaluating how well
    the work force has been managed against goals stated in performance indicators. The measurement of
    maintenance labor, especially direct, provides the baseline, or yardstick, against which labor manage-
    ment is measured. It should be noted that the classification of maintenance labor is based on the task
    performed, not on who does it.
    2.1.4. Maintenance labor is classified as direct or indirect. Indirect labor has two categories which are
    called production overhead and General & Administrative overhead (G&A).

2.2. Direct Labor. “Direct labor is work that can be identified, without undue cost or difficulty, to a sin-
gle, specific job order. Direct labor generally includes the hands-on maintenance, repair, overhaul, test,
and related direct production effort that follow the established sequence and content of work necessary to
accomplish the billable job. Direct labor does not include the support work identified as either indirect or
general and administrative in nature.” DoD FMR Volume 11B, Chapter 13, paragraph 130709, Oct 2002
    2.2.1. The following clarifications apply to AFMC:
       2.2.1.1. Direct labor must be identifiable to a specific Job Order Number (JON).
       2.2.1.2. Direct labor can be broken down into operations and sub-operations, and the amount of
       labor required can be measured directly.
       2.2.1.3. Direct labor furthers the value of the product or service through enhancement of the form,
       fit, and/or function to meet the desired specifications of the customer.
       2.2.1.4. Direct labor is supported by official work requests and authorized by prescribed work
       authorization documents indicating the specific nature of the work to be done. Direct labor must
       be assigned to a direct labor Resource Control Center (RCC), or direct labor time exception to a
       direct labor RCC.
       2.2.1.5. Direct labor for programmed workloads will be broken down into tasks and labor stan-
       dards determined for each task, as specified in Chapter 3. Direct labor tasks will be documented
       on a Work Control Document (WCD) in accordance with AFI 21-101_AFMCSUP. The time
       expended on direct labor tasks will be documented in the appropriate time & attendance and pro-
       duction systems.
AFMCI21-105 30 APRIL 2008                                                                                7


       2.2.1.6. Labor not identified as direct labor will be identified as indirect labor (production over-
       head and General & Administrative).

2.3. Indirect Labor.
   2.3.1. Production Overhead. Production overhead labor is all other labor expended in a Mainte-
   nance Group that does not meet the criteria for direct labor.
       2.3.1.1. Production overhead labor can generally be subdivided into two categories: indirect time
       in a production RCC, and shop support overhead. Production overhead labor is all labor expended
       at the RCC level in the maintenance production functions that does not meet the criteria for direct
       labor, i.e., not driven by volume. This includes tasks or functions that support direct labor, or
       which are inherent to having a direct labor capability.
       2.3.1.2. Indirect time includes all GS supervision, clerical and administrative labor. This will
       include all 300 series (unless funded directly by the program), annual leave, sick leave, and other
       paid leave. Also, functions such as attending classroom training or meetings are considered indi-
       rect labor when they involve people who are assigned to a direct RCC. The cost of this labor is
       apportioned over all products in the RCC rather than charged to one or more specific products.
       2.3.1.3. Shop support overhead is labor expended by personnel performing functions above RCC
       level in support of the Maintenance Group, and by personnel performing the primary mission of a
       staff or overhead function. It is performed by people who are not assigned to a production RCC.
   2.3.2. General and Administrative Labor (G&A). G&A labor is labor expended by personnel per-
   forming functions external to a Maintenance Group.
       2.3.2.1. G&A labor is all labor not meeting the qualifications for either direct or production over-
       head labor. This includes supervision, clerical, and training. There is a valid requirement for pro-
       duction overhead and G&A overhead labor, which must be recognized separately and should not
       be hidden through improper conversion or improper classification.
       2.3.2.2. The duty code assignment of personnel and subsequent man-hour exceptions should be
       based on recognition of the proper level at which the direct product labor costs are applied.

2.4. Relationship to Actual Labor Reporting. The reporting of actual labor utilization should be done
in accordance with the appropriate AFMC instruction. The reporting of actual labor should reflect the
classification of labor for the task each employee is assigned to do. Where an employee is temporarily
assigned to perform a task classified different from normal assignments, the labor time spent in the tem-
porary assignment must be reported based on the classification of the temporary assignment. For exam-
ple, if a worker who normally does production overhead work, performs a direct labor task, then the time
spent on that task must be reported as actual direct labor.

2.5. Responsibilities. The Planning/Scheduling Section (OBWP) at each ALC classifies maintenance
labor and determines if the maintenance labor should be charged to a specific JON. Local supplements
should be forwarded to HQ AFMC/A4D for review.

                                                Chapter 3

                         DIRECT LABOR METHODS AND STANDARDS

3.1. General. This chapter and related attachments address planning within the Maintenance Group, con-
ducting operational analyses, and developing, maintaining, and using labor standards at the depot.

3.2. Establishment of Methods and Standards.
    3.2.1. Definition. The definition of a labor standard is the time it should take a trained worker or
    group of trained workers, working at a normal pace, to produce a prescribed unit of work that con-
    forms to technical requirements and standards according to a specified method under specific working
    conditions.
    3.2.2. Operations Analysis (Study of the Method).
       3.2.2.1. An operations analysis encompasses the procedures that the process owners consider, i.e.,
       production, the purpose of the operations, methods used, inspection requirements, materials used,
       material handling, setup, tools, equipment, and working conditions.
       3.2.2.2. The operations analysis is considered an integral part of developing labor standards. The
       analysis should be accomplished and recorded prior to the determination of a labor standard, and
       in the improvement of established labor standards.
       3.2.2.3. An operations analysis should be based on a process chart, because of its wide application
       for describing and improving a method. The process chart is one of the most important tools for
       methods engineering, in that it provides a graphic presentation of the process. Typical types of
       process charts include flow process chart, operation process chart, operator process chart, man and
       machine process chart, work place layouts, Value Stream Maps, etc. The type of chart should be
       selected for a specific application. The level of detail may vary with type of standard.
       3.2.2.4. The operations analysis must be documented in sufficient detail (technique and type stan-
       dard dependent) to allow future reviewers to recreate the steps the original data developer used.
       3.2.2.5. Workloads longer than one year identified as having potential for methods improvement
       will have a method study accomplished within the first year after production initiation. The
       requirements of a Method Improvement Study are shown in 3.4.4.
    3.2.3. Classification. Labor standards are classified as engineered or non-engineered. The current
    labor standards system includes statistical formulas for the classification of various types of work
    measurement data. Input data for each step or sub-operation is identified as to work measurement
    technique; then accuracy and classification are mechanically determined. Accuracy formulas are
    shown in Attachment 3. For an end item standard to be classified as engineered, at least 80 percent of
    its total standard hours must be classified as engineered.
       3.2.3.1. Engineered labor standards must reflect a relative accuracy of plus or minus 10 percent,
       with a 90 percent or greater confidence level at the operation level. For short operations, the accu-
       racy requirement may be better met by accumulating small operations into operations whose times
       are approximately one-half hour.
       3.2.3.2. Non-engineered labor standards are all labor standards not meeting the above criteria.
AFMCI21-105 30 APRIL 2008                                                                              9


  3.2.4. Techniques. All of the techniques shown below are acceptable when correctly applied. labor
  standard techniques include:
     3.2.4.1. Standard data (DoD, AFMC Standard Data or commercially-available software). Policies
     concerning the establishment of Methods Time Measurement (MTM) based standard data ele-
     ments require a level of accuracy equivalent to an engineered approved standard. When standard
     data is used to build a standard, the standard is classified as engineered.
     3.2.4.2. Other engineering techniques (time study, group timing techniques, or work sampling).
     Formulas are available in Attachment 3 to determine the accuracy of time study/group timing
     technique, or work sampling data. Therefore, these formulas can be used to determine the number
     of observations or samples required to classify data as engineered.
     3.2.4.3. Regression and Correlation analysis. Standards developed using this technique will be
     considered engineered when the data used for the analysis is engineered.
     3.2.4.4. Technical estimates based on technical orders (TO) or other factual data. This type of
     standard is classified as non-engineered .
     3.2.4.5. Estimates. Judgmental standards set by engineering or planning personnel and process
     owners. This type of standard is classified as non-engineered, and should be targeted for conver-
     sion where cost effective, using the work measurement technique with the best combination of
     accuracy and economy. Estimates must be broken down into a level of work units that allows con-
     fidence in the validity of the estimate. Include preparation and de-preparation times when setting
     non-engineered standards. These times can be applied in two ways: in the personal, fatigue, and
     delay (PF&D) allowance in cases where the operator prepares for the entire shift (e.g., put on pro-
     tective clothing), and in elemental times when the time is associated with an individual operation
     (e.g., get a special tool). The goal is consistency to ensure the same amount of time is allowed and
     earned for performing like operations. PF&D will be displayed at the sub-operation level for
     exchangeables and operation level for aircraft for non-engineered standards. This is an allowance
     to be added to direct labor to arrive at standard time. This procedure will make the calculation of
     non-engineered standards consistent with the procedure for engineered standards. See paragraph
     3.3.9 for procedures on allowances.
  3.2.5. Learning Curve. The labor standard will not incorporate factors which reflect the training
  techniques used and skill of personnel (learning curve effect). These factors are used in projecting
  labor efficiency (see Chapter 4).
  3.2.6. Recycle Time. The labor standard may include that recycle time inherent in the repair process
  that does not result from some action or inaction by the repair technician. The inclusion of recycle
  time must be based upon it being observed, studied, an occurrence factor developed, and allowable
  time added to the labor standard as an occurrence factor to a step or sub-operation within a specific
  operation.
  3.2.7. Performance Rating (Leveling). Performance rating is the act of comparing the actual perfor-
  mance of a worker against a defined concept of normal performance. Performance rating will be per-
  formed in conjunction with work samples, time studies, and other techniques where applicable. All
  technicians accomplishing performance rating must be currently certified in the system being used.
  3.2.8. Occurrence Factors.
10                                                                         AFMCI21-105 30 APRIL 2008


        3.2.8.1. The frequency of occurrence for each element will be determined and the information
        recorded must be clearly identified to the operations, sub-operations, or steps to which it applies.
        The frequency will be expressed as a percentage of element occurrences when all considerations
        of work requirements, moves, and recycling are made.
        3.2.8.2. To further explain occurrence factor development: document the source of occurrence
        factor data; the method used to obtain the occurrence factor; any computations used to convert the
        source data into occurrence factors; and any special conditions.
        3.2.8.3. Additional information on ways to calculate occurrence factors is included in Attach-
        ment 4.
     3.2.9. Allowances.
        3.2.9.1. Allowances for PF&D must be developed using procedures contained in Attachment 9
        and included as part of the labor standard. When increased allowances are used due to tempera-
        ture, lighting, noise, and other environmental situations, actual readings must be documented.
        3.2.9.2. There will be no subjectively assigned or applied special delay allowances. Special delay
        allowances must be supported by an engineered backup study of the work conditions.
        3.2.9.3. The determination of a separate PF&D allowance for each labor operation performed may
        not be feasible due to the large number of operations in depot maintenance. Adequate allowances
        can be achieved through study and identification of different type work conditions and the appli-
        cation of pre-established allowances based upon these conditions. Each allowance will then be
        applied to all operations under the conditions associated with that allowance. There will be no
        "across the board" type increases or decreases in allowance category percentage without the sup-
        port of an engineering study.
        3.2.9.4. Allowances will be applied at the sub-operation level for exchangeable items and the
        operation level for aircraft. As a minimum, a sub-operation/operation is defined as a work unit
        performed at one work station with one skill level. If the unit is moved to another work station, or
        a different skill level is required (e.g. system test to repair), a new sub-operation/operation must be
        established to allow PF&D to be applied. When estimates and historical data are used for
        non-engineered standards, it may be necessary to first remove the allowance or a portion of the
        allowance from the basic time to prevent double counting. See Attachment 5 for examples of
        documentation.
        3.2.9.5. Special condition (other). Time expended by direct labor personnel on the inventory of
        tools is placed in the labor standard when the inventory is required once per operation, end item,
        or movement to or from a work area. When the inventory is performed on a once per day fre-
        quency, the time is placed in the PF&D allowance as part of end-of-shift cleanup time. The percent
        of cleanup time for tool inventory (control) should be documented.
     3.2.10. Coordination/Approval.
        3.2.10.1. Labor standards will be coordinated with appropriate supervisory personnel for com-
        pleteness of work elements and method content. It is recommended that coordination with produc-
        tion personnel be done prior to time measurement.
        3.2.10.2. Coordinating personnel are allowed 5 workdays to express in writing reasons for
        non-concurrence. If no reply is received within 5 workdays the standard is considered coordinated
AFMCI21-105 30 APRIL 2008                                                                                 11


      and accepted. Insufficient labor standard time is not considered a valid reason for non-concur-
      rence.
   3.2.11. Duration. Labor standards will remain in effect until revised according to paragraph 3.4. or
   retired to an inactive file.

3.3. Documentation of Standards.
   3.3.1. Work measurement personnel must maintain sufficient documentation to comply with the pro-
   visions of this instruction. They will develop and maintain an active labor standard file that contains
   supporting and backup data for the labor standard. Backup material can be stored in a different loca-
   tion, or on a media different than paper, as long as a consistent procedure is followed and an audit trail
   is maintained. The use of electronic storage is encouraged, with the ability to print out documentation
   upon demand. Backup procedures must be in effect to prevent the loss or destruction of electroni-
   cally-stored information.
   3.3.2. A master file can be established for each standard having application in more than one RCC, or
   to more than one production number. Pertinent backup data should be maintained in this file to facili-
   tate the establishment and audit of the standard. When backup data is used to establish a labor stan-
   dard for another control number, a file number reference "To and From" will be made on the master
   and referenced files. This annotation will make it unnecessary to duplicate the backup material.
   3.3.3. Documentation requirements for engineered standards are shown in Attachment 5.
   3.3.4. Non-engineered standards should include all available documentation, but as a minimum must
   specify the name of the industrial engineering technician and the date, the origin of the standard and
   the occurrence factor, the SFD calculations for commodities, PF&D calculations, and a historical
   record of any changes.

3.4. Review/Revision of Methods and Standards.
   3.4.1. Review. Reviews of labor methods and standards are event driven and not calendar driven.
   Some examples of occurrences that would dictate a review are listed below.
      3.4.1.1. New Work Load. Work load processes or operations not previously performed on an end
      item.
      3.4.1.2. Change in Technical Data. Change in technical data that applies to form, fit, and function
      of an end item. Types of technical data includes blue prints, drawings, technical orders, etc. (per
      TO 00-5-1)
      3.4.1.3. Change in Work Load. Change in procedures due to product mix, volume increase or
      decrease, new equipment, new procedures, etc.
      3.4.1.4. Rapid Improvement Events (RIE). RIEs are process improvements that result in reduction
      in operation set-up times, manpower requirements, first time through quality, or processing
      requirements.
      3.4.1.5. Work Control Document. When content of the WCD changes
   3.4.2. As a minimum, a labor standard review will contain all the elements described in Attachment
   6.
12                                                                       AFMCI21-105 30 APRIL 2008


     3.4.3. Revision. Revision of work measurement standards is appropriate when evidence indicates that
     changes have occurred to the work process. Insufficient time allowed, or low performance efficiency
     are not acceptable reasons to warrant a revision to a standard. However, these may be reasons for fur-
     ther investigations. In the case of aircraft standards, Maintenance Group personnel must inform the
     local Centralized Asset Management (CAM) of revisions, so that planning documentation can be
     updated.
     3.4.4. Method Improvement Studies.
        3.4.4.1. Method improvement studies are an integral part of continuous process improvement.
        They are performed to provide managers with ideas and data on how to achieve optimal
        approaches to doing work. Each study should provide improvement and standardization of the
        methods, equipment, working conditions, and operator training. Candidates for method improve-
        ment studies should be selectively chosen from high labor intensive areas, suggestion programs,
        analysis of management information reports, feedback from the production work force, etc.
        3.4.4.2. A method improvement study will document a clear description of the current work pro-
        cess, the proposed process, flow process charts for current and proposed methods, and an analyti-
        cal comparison of the two methods, as applicable. The work center supervisor or designated
        representative will review and coordinate with the new method description before the standards
        are set or revised, and subsequently report any deviations from the approved method.
        3.4.4.3. In the case of new workloads, direct labor costs must be documented in order to satisfy
        the requirement of the buying activity that the projected levels of productivity are reasonable and
        attainable. Ideally, projected direct labor hours are backed up by a methods improvement study,
        plus documented labor standards. In practice, this work measurement continuous process
        improvement cycle may not coincide with the need to provide labor costs for new workloads.
        When this occurs, the projected times must be based on a combination of historical times, plus
        professional judgments based on programmed, documented changes (e.g., acquisition of new
        equipment, revised floor layouts, work content changes, etc.). As soon as the changes are imple-
        mented, time variations must be recorded in order to provide evidence of attainability. In addition,
        realistic labor efficiency factors must be used to compute startup costs (see Paragraphs 4.7. and
        4.8.).

3.5. Application of Standards.
     3.5.1. Labor standards coverage.
        3.5.1.1. All planned work will be covered by standards, either engineered, or non-engineered
        (estimates).
        3.5.1.2. Labor standards coverage is based on Direct Product Standard Hours (DPSH). The DPSH
        for an organization are the summation of individual end item labor standard hours multiplied by
        the number of projected or actual units produced during the period being measured. Engineered
        labor standards coverage is the percentage derived from dividing the number of engineered DPSH
        by the total number of permanent programmed DPSH, including engineered and non-engineered
        hours. This metric, percent engineered standards coverage, is one commonly accepted measure of
        a work measurement program. When this calculation is made, the baseline total should exclude
        the following workloads:
            3.5.1.2.1. Temporary or non-programmed workload.
AFMCI21-105 30 APRIL 2008                                                                            13


         3.5.1.2.2. Modifications or other permanent workloads with a life span of 18 months or less.
         3.5.1.2.3. Support provided offsite.
     3.5.1.3. The centers have the authority to decide where, and to what extent to apply engineered
     standards based on their competitive needs, and economic considerations, i.e., where anticipated
     direct labor savings exceed the cost of standards development. General guidelines for selecting
     which standards to engineer are contained in Attachment 8. There is no blanket, across the board
     numerical coverage goal.
  3.5.2. Variance analysis.
     3.5.2.1. Direct labor efficiency, earned standard hours divided by actual hours, is a measure
     designed to identify potential problems within a work organization, usually an RCC or work cen-
     ter. Significant variance between the projected labor efficiency and reported (actual) efficiency
     indicates a potential need for process improvements, and should be made clearly visible to the pro-
     cess owners for analysis, assessment, and process improvements as necessary through lean activi-
     ties. Continued variance should be reviewed at appropriate levels of management, as one of
     several measures of cost effectiveness and resource management.
     3.5.2.2. Organizational variance analysis is covered in more detail in Chapter 4, Paragraphs 4.4.
     and 4.5. of this instruction.
14                                                                        AFMCI21-105 30 APRIL 2008

                          INDIRECT LABOR FACTORS AND EFFICIENCY

4.1. General. Indirect labor standards are established to account for labor expended by and for an RCC
that is not accounted for by direct labor standards. These standards allow for the cost of indirect labor to
be apportioned over all the products repaired in the RCC rather than charged to one or more specific prod-
ucts. To fully evaluate the cost of the items repaired by the RCC and to evaluate their performance, it is
necessary to establish standards or allowances for supervisory, clerical, training, and other legitimate time
expenditures and for annual, holiday, administrative and sick leave time. These standards or allowances
are established and converted to annual factors. Sick and annual leave should be shown with a seasonal
(periodic) variation and the factor for training adjusted for known variations.

4.2. References.
     4.2.1. AFMCI 65-101, Depot Maintenance Accounting & Production System-Financial Policy &
     Procedures for Organic Depot Maintenance
     4.2.2. AFMCI 21-136, Depot Maintenance Production Labor Entry (TAA)

4.3. Indirect Labor Factor Procedures. Standard indirect labor factors for budgeting, cost accounting,
planning, and reporting are developed and distributed by the responsible function, obtaining coordination
from other organizational components as required. These factors are established for the fiscal year and are
not to be changed unless a significant change in workload or organization occurs. Once this standard time
has been established, it is converted into an indirect factor by dividing the standard by the total direct
hours available to the RCC.
     4.3.1. Use the following procedures for establishing factors for indirect labor (excluding leave):
        4.3.1.1. Accumulate all pertinent data available, for example, historical, job description, etc.
        4.3.1.2. Determine work elements in each account.
        4.3.1.3. Evaluate each work element using accepted work measurement techniques, for example,
        work sampling, time study, frequency studies, etc.
        4.3.1.4. Total the elements for each account and express as a percent of projected direct labor.
        4.3.1.5. Coordinate indirect labor factors with affected supervisory personnel as to completeness
        of the work elements.
        4.3.1.6. Justify. the indirect factors by sufficient data for normal confidence in their accuracy.
        Where the use of work measurement techniques is not feasible nor cost effective, historic data will
        be considered adequate.
     4.3.2. Establish indirect labor factors for leave using historical records and backup data. Annual leave
     should be computed on the basis of total leave accumulation within the RCC. Local base policies gen-
     erally exist to govern the use of sick leave. Annual leave should generally be prorated with a periodic
     variation that might be reasonably expected. Other type leave (holiday, administrative, etc.) is
     grouped under duty code .33. Leave factor allowances are computed on the basis of projected direct
     labor and used as a factor of direct earned hours.
AFMCI21-105 30 APRIL 2008                                                                                 15


   4.3.3. Standard indirect labor factors are compiled and distributed to the appropriate budgeting, cost
   accounting, planning, and management organizations. These factors will be broken out by month and
   the element of leave will include factors for duty codes .31 annual leave, .32 sick leave, and .33 holi-
   day leave. Backup data for the indirect labor standards and the indirect labor factors for the fiscal year
   in which they are used will be filed in the appropriate responsible organization.

4.4. Labor Efficiency Variance. Analysis of the variance between the RCC projected labor efficiency
and the reported (actual) labor efficiency can identify the organization's potential productivity improve-
ments.
   4.4.1. Labor efficiency, defined as earned (standard) hours divided by actual hours, will be used for
   its intended purpose as a management tool for pinpointing potential workload or organizational prob-
   lems. When potential problems are indicated, planning may be requested to assist with the following:
       4.4.1.1. Identify the variance to study.
       4.4.1.2. Define the makeup of this variance and quantify the various components.
       4.4.1.3. Design a specific get-well or improvement plan and coordinate with all parties concerned.
       4.4.1.4. Report and track the findings and the progress to resolve the problems at all levels of
       management.

4.5. Responsibility.
   4.5.1. Variances should be reviewed by engineering and/or planning personnel, with input and coor-
   dination by the production supervisor. Not all labor efficiency variance issues can be, or should be
   resolved by engineering and/or planning personnel. The variance can be a result of many factors
   requiring a number of different organizations involved in the solution. The variance may include
   potential areas for improvement as a result of:
       4.5.1.1. Inadequate resources (e.g. technical data, tooling and equipment, facilities).
       4.5.1.2. Inadequate material support (e.g., no parts, late parts, poor parts movement, cannibaliza-
       tion).
       4.5.1.3. Technical problems (e.g., procedures and methods, technique sensitive).
       4.5.1.4. Personnel (e.g., improper skill mix, insufficient training, learning curve, poor supervi-
       sion).

4.6. Labor Efficiency Factors. Labor efficiency factors will be developed and documented. The pro-
jected factors will be coordinated with the responsible levels of management.

4.7. Procedures.
   4.7.1. Projected labor efficiency factors are developed for each RCC on an annual basis.
   4.7.2. This guidance is provided so that these factors may be developed on an objective basis. The
   specific conditions covered below are actual existing conditions and may not be accounted for in the
   development of labor standards or the use of PF&D factors.
16                                                                       AFMCI21-105 30 APRIL 2008


4.8. Conditions. Labor efficiency factors are developed by projecting the effect of the following condi-
tions on labor efficiency. Justification must be kept on file and available for audit purposes. The following
are the most important conditions which can influence historical and projected labor efficiency:
     4.8.1. Workload Mix. Defined as the number of different items and the volume of each item per
     period:
        4.8.1.1. Changes in workload mix may cause changes in labor efficiency.
        4.8.1.2. Changes in workload mix, which are inconsistent with the current assignment of person-
        nel and skills, may cause some workers to be assigned to the repair of certain items with which
        they are not familiar. This may cause more time for research of technical data, safety require-
        ments, and quality requirements.
        4.8.1.3. Changes in workload mix may cause temporary tool or equipment shortages.
        4.8.1.4. Some processes may be pre-identified as being sensitive to workload volume or mix
        changes.
     4.8.2. Tooling and Equipment.
        4.8.2.1. Changes in equipment downtime may cause disruptions to smooth work flow and com-
        pletion of items. This is normally related to equipment age, lack of preventative maintenance, and
        rate of usage.
        4.8.2.2. Lack of sufficient equipment may cause inefficiencies. This may result from insufficient
        lead time in the acquisition of required tooling and equipment.
     4.8.3. Training of New Personnel. On-the-job training and new or reassigned personnel when new
     skills must be acquired will affect efficiency.
     4.8.4. Product Quality. Changes in reject rates and rework effort may impact the labor efficiency.
     4.8.5. Learning Curve. For new workloads or major changes in work requirements, personnel will
     begin at a relatively low performance level and improve with the repetition of repair actions. The
     impact of this on labor efficiency depends upon the amount of experience with the workload and the
     size of new workload in relation to the total RCC workload. Compensation for this condition is incor-
     porated in the labor efficiency factors and not the labor standard itself.
     4.8.6. Shift Worked. Changes in the number of shifts worked or changes in the relative percentage of
     total work by shift may impact labor efficiency. This change is caused by such things as a reduced
     amount of support available (material, materials handling capability, engineering, maintenance, etc.).
     4.8.7. Material Support. A change in the level of material support may impact the labor efficiency.
     This may be caused by time spent by mechanics getting material, waiting for material, or changing
     from one job to another because of material unavailability. The size of the awaiting parts inventory
     may be an indicator of material support problems.

                                      SHOP FLOW DAYS (SFD)

5.1. Background. In order to ensure combat units of the Air Force have the required equipment at the
right time and place, AFMC must maintain the ability to replenish base stock levels through the constant
flow of recoverable material to and from globally-deployed units. This material flow is known as depot
repair cycle time (DRCT), commonly called pipeline time. One of the most important segments of DRCT
is SFD. Over or understatement of SFD standards creates unrealistic provisioning of spares and erroneous
repair requirement computation. This results in critical items and stock shortages or unneeded stock. Con-
sequently, the importance of establishing accurate SFD standards cannot be overemphasized. This
directly relates to objectives of the AFMC Mission to enhance the competitiveness of our operations by
improving throughput, and decreasing inventory and operating expense. We need to measure standard
SFD, and then work toward reducing actual SFD, through lean process improvements, and application of
theory of constraints, etc.

5.2. SFD Standard. The SFD standards are computed estimates representing the planned number of cal-
endar days required to process an end item, measured from the time the item is received in the Mainte-
nance Group to the day of serviceable turn-in. SFD standards are based on a summation of direct labor
standards for individual operations. The labor standards can be engineered, or non-engineered. The stan-
dard flow time development assumes that all assets and parts are available when the item is scheduled into
the repair process. Delay time for multiple assets inducted on the same work order will not be included in
SFD unless the approved repair process authorizes the batching of items; therefore this delay time will not
be part of the process support factor in the SFD standard. The standard is input to the shop floor control
system where it is used in the computation of repair and buy requirements. The standard also supports the
workload planning, scheduling, and negotiation functions.

5.3. SFD Development. SFD standards for components are developed by summarizing labor standards
representing the setup and run time for each operation the component flows through in the repair process,
plus process delay times, including move and queue times between operations. The resultant elapsed time,
expressed in hours, is then converted to calendar days by multiplying the hours by a conversion factor and
dividing by the hours worked per week. The planner must furnish the component calculated flow days to
the originating or responsible RCC planner, who, using a network charting technique, graphically dis-
plays the flow data for all components, enabling a logical end item depot flow time standard to be estab-
lished. All planners who develop the SFD standards must review them as follows: with labor standard
audit or review programs; when major changes in the repair process occur; or upon request of the cus-
tomer. Documentation requirements of the review are shown in Attachment 5.

5.4. File Maintenance of Standards. Each planning element, or equivalent responsible unit, develops,
maintains and inputs the standard shop flow days into E046B, which in turn will update G004L and
G019C. The system will perform the computations, but all backup data must be retained in the planning
package. The planner, or equivalent function, which develops the SFD standard must ensure the SFD

5.5. SFD Standard Computation. The following formula is used to compute SFD standards in calendar
days. The resultant decimal is rounded up to whole days.
SFD = 7.3[(S/I)+P]/(DH)                  where: 7.3 = 7X (260/250).
The 7 converts time in weeks to time in days; 260/250 converts weekdays per year to workdays so that the
10 federal holidays are accounted for.
S = Standard hours. Includes all occurrence factors for all repair frequencies, and PF&D. When an opera-
tion with a labor standard takes place concurrent to a process support or unique process support operation
(factor P below), only include the standard time for the longer of the two in the equation. Also include all
work done on the end item within the RCC when the work consists of sequential operations performed by
one worker only. For work consisting of concurrent operations or operations performed by multiple work-
ers, the labor standard must be reduced accordingly. Only include the standard time for the longest con-
current operation (critical path). Reduce the standard time for operations performed by multiple workers
by dividing the operations standard by the number of workers.
I = RCC constant. Direct labor percent factors expressed as a decimal of productive hours available per
shift. The RCC direct labor percent factor is determined by removing the RCC yearly average indirect cat-
egory time values (that is, duty codes .24, .25, .26, and .29) from the 100 percent availability. (The per-
centage factor for janitorial services in code .26 is not to be included in the development of the RCC
yearly average.)
P = Process support. Develop an average time value for required process steps, both process-related and
general. These times will be expressed in hours. Include all occurrence factors for all repair frequencies.
Examples of process related time include plating, curing, heat treat processes, test warm-ups, etc. General
process time includes end item transportation time, queue time, etc. Allowances may also be included, on
a pro-rated basis, for planned delays and transportations such as equipment down for periodic calibration
and maintenance, and transportation of material from supply. Process support time concurrent to a longer
labor operation time is not included. This will not include storage time for awaiting parts. An average pro-
cess support factor will not be a blanket time value. Backup studies will be used to the extent possible, and
must be retained for audit purposes.
D = Days per week (4, 4.5, 5, 6, or 7)
H = Hours per day in work (7.7 to 24)
NOTE: There may be instances within an RCC where single shift and multi-shifts coexist. In such cases,
caution must be exercised in computing the SFD standard.

5.6. Computation Example.
S = 3 standard hours
I = 87 percent = .87
P = 4 hours transportation time + 8 hours test warm up = 12 hours
D = 5 day workweek
H = single 8 hour shift
7.3. [(3 / .87) +12] /(5X 8)
7.3. (3.45+12)/40
AFMCI21-105 30 APRIL 2008                                                                             19


2.82., which is rounded up to 3.0 calendar days
NOTE: When a production number has support shop operations, the support shop planner will provide
the SFD (to two decimal places) to the network planner for consolidation and input to the shop floor con-
trol system.

5.7. Actual SFD. Actual SFD represent the actual number of calendar days required to process an end
item, measured from the time the item is placed in work in the Maintenance Group to the day of service-
able turn-in. The average of the actual SFD will be compared with the standard SFD by the responsible
planner to determine if the standard SFD requires adjustment, or if other actions are needed to improve
actual conditions impacting actual flow days. A statistical analysis of the SFD should be performed quar-
terly on those end items whose actual shop flow days are greater than or equal to one standard deviation
from the standard. The population for review will be determined by a weighted average variance between
the standard and the actual SFD of greater than 500. The weighted average will be derived from multiply-
ing the flow day variance by the number of occurrences (completion of repair) for the national stock num-
ber (NSN). The data for review will be extracted from the current shop floor tracking system. Analysis in
most cases will pinpoint causes in actual flow day variance. The standard must be changed if workload
content or shop flow layout change, or if other process improvements occur. Standard SFD are not to be
erroneously manipulated by factors affecting actual SFD.

                                        ACCURACY FORMULAS

A3.1. Time (Stop Watch) Study and Group Timing Technique.
     A3.1.1. There are many references containing formulas and procedures for the statistical analysis of
     time study data. These procedures are based on the number of cycles, the mean time, the range
     between cycles, and the standard deviation. Repetitive time study accuracy is established at the ele-
     mental level. For non-repetitive time studies, accuracy is established at the cycle level.
     A3.1.2. The formula below represents an accurate method of determining the statistical validity of
     study data:
        S = (SD / vN)(T) Where:
                 X
           S = Relative accuracy
           X = Arithmetic mean of the time values
           SD = Standard deviation
           N = Number of samples
           T = The (N-1) t value (See t Table A3.1.)

NOTE: Table A3.1. Extracted from "Probability and Statistics for Engineers," Irwin Miller, John E. Fre-
und represents 90 percent confidence level.
     A3.1.3. Level of accuracy required should be the highest attainable, based upon the type of work
     being performed. Highly repetitive, short-cycle operations must have high quality standard times (+/-
     10 percent). Highly variable repairs may not have consistent times from occurrence to occurrence,
AFMCI21-105 30 APRIL 2008                                                                            23


   particularly at the elemental level. Consequently the development of statistically accurate times may
   not be attainable within practical and attainable limits.
   A3.1.4. A finite number of time study observations should be made for highly variable work elements
   to ensure proper and economical use of the industrial engineering resources. The precise number can
   be determined by establishing a minimum number of cycles to be observed and calculating the accu-
   racy after this minimum has been measured. If the accuracy is unacceptable, a specific number of
   additional cycles can be observed, and a new accuracy calculation made. If a significant improvement
   has not been achieved, the study should be stopped and the current level of accuracy accepted and
   reported for the standard. All supporting study data will be maintained as an audit trail.

A3.2. Work Sampling.
   A3.2.1. The following formulas are used to determine the relative or absolute accuracy of work sam-
   pling data:
   Relative: SR = Z v [ (1 – P) / (N * P) ]
   Absolute: SA = Z v { [ P * (1 – P) ] / N }
   Where:
   SR = Relative accuracy expressed as a decimal.
   SA = Absolute accuracy expressed as a decimal.
     Z = Number of standard errors.
       = 1.645 for 90 percent confidence level.
     P = Percent occurrence expressed as a decimal.
     N = Number of observations.
   A3.2.2. Compute SR or SA according to the formula above. When absolute accuracy is used, the SA
   = SR(P) relationship will hold true.
   A3.2.3. To determine the number of work sampling observations required to attain a specified statis-
   tical accuracy at a desired percent confidence level, the following formulas are used:
   Relative: N = Z² (1 - P)
                 SR² (P)
   Absolute: N = Z² P(1 - P)
                     SA²
NOTE: To use the above formulas, the value of P must be estimated before the study. The formula is also
used at various points in the study to determine progress toward a predetermined statistical accuracy.

                                      OCCURRENCE FACTORS

A4.1. Data collection used for occurrence factors requires the same statistical analysis as the work mea-
surement technique dictates.

A4.2. In the past, occurrence factors have caused many Engineered Standards to be declared invalid
because the backup data was not maintained.

A4.3. Defining occurrence factors -- The development of labor standards requires that each operation,
sub-operation, and/or step be reviewed for FREQUENCY, another name for occurrence factor. Simply
put, frequency is that percent of the time an action, task or process occurs during the completion of a work
cycle (completion of repair on a particular end item/asset). Another way to relate occurrence is the rela-
tionship to the next higher assembly or the unit of production count.

A4.4. The total time value of the labor standard is the sum of the operations times the frequency of each
operation. An operation is the sum of all sub-operations under that operation, times the frequency of each
sub-operation, a sub-operation is the sum of all steps under that sub-operation times the frequency of each
step.

A4.5. Occurrences are expressed as a percentage; however, inputting uses the decimal equivalent. Input-
ting the frequency is three to the left and two to the right of the decimal; i.e., 125 percent would be input
as 1.25. The minimum percent of time is .01 or 1 percent; the maximum is 999.99 times. If more is
required, use additional steps, sub-operations, or operations.

A4.6. There are at least 10 different ways to calculate an occurrence factor:
     A4.6.1. Arithmetic Mean. Derived by dividing the sum of the values of applicable data by the num-
     ber of data elements involved. This data may be from either observation or obtained from other
     records. Workload data will normally come from a sample of the total population.
        A4.6.1.1. Examples.
            A4.6.1.1.1. Average number of parts per item as observed from TO and workload figures.
            A4.6.1.1.2. Average number of items obtained per trip.
            A4.6.1.1.3. Average number of paces per trip.
     A4.6.2. Calculated Ratio. The physical characteristics of the work situation are such that the occur-
     rence can be calculated without introduction of errors.
        A4.6.2.1. Examples.
            A4.6.2.1.1. Number of selections required to select the correct leads from a number of leads.
            A4.6.2.1.2. Number of times an object must be turned to select the proper side.
            A4.6.2.1.3. Number of screws to install a panel when the time value is per screw installed.
AFMCI21-105 30 APRIL 2008                                                                                25


         A4.6.2.1.4. Number of square inches to be cleaned for a geometric configuration when it is
         constant from cycle to cycle and a "per square inch" time value is to be applied.
  A4.6.3. Observed Proportion. There are situations where only one of a group of tasks can occur any
  given time. Over an extended period of time, each event/task must occur. Each event proportion will
  be the percentage of the total observations divided by the observations for that particular event or task.
  The sum of all proportions will equal 100 percent.
     A4.6.3.1. Examples.
         A4.6.3.1.1. Proportion of removal of a threaded fastener with resistance.
         A4.6.3.1.2. Using multiple tools on a task; i.e., removing a nut from a bolt, using a screw-
         driver and an open-end wrench. What proportion of the task used the screwdriver versus the
         wrench. Both the screwdriver and the wrench time values must be on a part of a turn.
  A4.6.4. Physically Determined. The physical characteristics of the work are such that the occur-
  rence is determined by looking at the item or the related technical data. No error is induced.
     A4.6.4.1. Examples.
         A4.6.4.1.1. Number of bolts per specific end item.
         A4.6.4.1.2. Distance between anchors to be safety wired on an end item.
  A4.6.5. Method Determined. Determined by the analyst specifying the sequence of operations and
  prescribing standard conditions. The majority of the occurrence factors will be 100 percent. No error
  induced.
     A4.6.5.1. Examples.
         A4.6.5.1.1. Obtain parts from bin.
         A4.6.5.1.2. Regular elements occurring once every cycle.
         A4.6.5.1.3. Standard data to perform a specific task.
         A4.6.5.1.4. Under certain safety situations, regulations require two or more people to be in
         attendance. Under most circumstances the "safety" people will be working on their own tasks
         and not charged to the tasks being measured; however, if these people are required for safety
         and have no other tasks, then the time will be occurrences as more than one worker (larger than
         100 percent).
  A4.6.6. Support Shop. The origin planner asks for back-shop support. One of the data items to input
  is "OCC FAC," which will either be estimated or taken from production records. In each case, they
  should be reviewed during negotiations with the back-shop.
     A4.6.6.1. Example.
         A4.6.6.1.1. Origin planner sends a part to be painted and has determined that the occurrence
         factor is 50 percent; however, later the customer or item manager determines this will be
         required 100 percent of the time. The origin planner must then update his planning documents
         with the new data.
26                                                                         AFMCI21-105 30 APRIL 2008


     A4.6.7. Recycle Factor. Tasks that haven't been completed for one reason or another are classified as
     recycle. These are not tasks caused by operator error (rework). Rework is not included in the occur-
     rence factor. Recycle tasks will be 100 percent plus whatever extra time is required.
        A4.6.7.1. Example.
            A4.6.7.1.1. End item test failure. Many test stands are programmed to stop at the first failure,
            indicating what part or area has not met the required specifications. The unit is repaired as the
            test stand has indicated, then retested for either pass or fail. This is true "recycle" time and is
            included as part of the "should take time" by prorating the test time over 100 percent.
            A4.6.7.1.2. If the "repair after test" time is a separate task from "repair" then the prorated time
            does not have to be 100 percent plus, but carried as the actual percentage observed.
            A4.6.7.1.3. When the operator has omitted a sequential task, regardless of the reason, the
            omitted time is "recycle" time; however, any time required to disassemble/assemble so the
            omitted task can be completed is rework and cannot be credited.
            A4.6.7.1.4. When an installed part has proven to be defective, the time to reinstall a new part
            is classified as "recycle" time and prorated by the occurrence factor.
            A4.6.7.1.5. Work normally required to hand fit or correct inherent deficiencies of an assembly
            will be occurrence factored.
            A4.6.7.1.6. Unavoidable calibration, adjustments or unpredictable work done as the result of
            an inspection or test and the necessary retests.
NOTE: Rework is any work done on an item to correct work previously done due to operator error.
Rework will not be included in the direct production labor standards. The workload generated through
rework requirements must be isolated for special considerations. This isolation of rework would result in
a variance of the earned hour report and operating cost reported.
     A4.6.8. Historical Data. May be used to determine occurrence factor.
        A4.6.8.1. Example.
            A4.6.8.1.1. Completed work control document.
            A4.6.8.1.2. Monthly production count summary.
            A4.6.8.1.3. Routing slip history file.
     A4.6.9. Technical Data Requirements. An occurrence factor dictated by applicable TO technical
     data.
        A4.6.9.1. Example.
            A4.6.9.1.1. Time compliance technical order (TCTO).
            A4.6.9.1.2. Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) regulations.
            A4.6.9.1.3. Directives from the item manager.
     A4.6.10. Study Determined. Occurrence factors which are study determined are based on the num-
     ber of times the event occurs during the development of a labor standard.
        A4.6.10.1. Example.
AFMCI21-105 30 APRIL 2008                                                                                27


           A4.6.10.1.1. A ten-cycle study (previously determined to be representative of the work load)
           was completed with the required statistical accuracy for an Engineered Standard. One of the
           elements had only two (2/10) occurrences (non-engineered); therefore, an occurrence factor of
           20 percent.
           A4.6.10.1.2. An element with identical work content (right and left hand subassemblies
           installed) will have an occurrence factor of 200 percent providing the element description
           reads "install right and left hand subassemblies."

A4.7. The data can be developed from several different sources such as:
   A4.7.1. Data collected while doing the work measurement study.
   A4.7.2. Data taken from the work control document.
   A4.7.3. Data taken from the test stand. Some test stands have, as part of their input, serial number
   indicator to give a count at end of tests.
   A4.7.4. Historical data (work control documents, shipping records, etc.).
   A4.7.5. All recycled work, work controlled by the test equipment, not by worker error or neglect, is
   considered as "should take time," requiring an occurrence factor.
   A4.7.6. Material usage records.

A4.8. Documentation of occurrence factors must be maintained in the labor standard jacket to provide an
audit trail. The following must be documented for backup:
   A4.8.1. Source -- Reason occurrence required.
       A4.8.1.1. Method -- Technique used.
       A4.8.1.2. Conversion factors.
       A4.8.1.3. Special conditions.

A4.9. The documentation requirements may be hand scribed (legibly) on documents which already exist
in the Labor Standard Jacket/File. The recorded information must be clearly defined as to the operation,
sub-operation or step to which the occurrence applies. Data may also be a part of any computer output
product, generally on a supplementary line, as long as it provides an audit trail.

A4.10. As in all work measurement techniques used to develop Engineered Standards, the analyst must
be assured that a "representative sample" of the workload has been observed. The absolute minimum
number is three units; however, with the high variability in our workload, an agreement must be made
between the Industrial Engineering Technician and the production shop to determine a realistic quantity.

A4.11. All labor standards are an average time; therefore, the larger the sample the better the statistical
reliability will be. There comes a point in time where it is not economically feasible to study a task any
longer, but it must meet the statistical accuracy of plus or minus 10 percent at 90 percent confidence level
in order to be classified as an engineered standard.

                      DOCUMENTATION FOR ENGINEERED STANDARDS

A5.1. Engineered labor standards must include as a minimum:
     A5.1.1. Documentation of an operations analysis.
     A5.1.2. A record of standard practice or method followed when the standard was developed.
     A5.1.3. A record of rating or leveling observed during performance where applicable.
     A5.1.4. A record of the standard time computation including explanation of PF&D allowances.
     A5.1.5. A record of observed, synthesized, or predetermined time system time values used in deter-
     mining the final standard time, e.g., data collection sheets.
     A5.1.6. A minimum of 80 percent of the normal time associated with the labor effort covered by the
     standard will be derived from recognized industrial engineering techniques in which the statistical
     accuracy requirement can be demonstrated to meet the above.
     A5.1.7. Occurrence factor calculations and supporting backup data.
     A5.1.8. An "Historical Record Change" memorandum explaining the reason for each labor standard
     increase or decrease in standard time. This requirement includes changes in the standard practice
     (method) which is implemented but does not impact the standard time sufficiently to require alter-
     ation.
     A5.1.9. Flowchart or diagram.
     A5.1.10. Work area layout.
     A5.1.11. SFD standard computations (for commodities only).

A5.2. This documentation must be maintained in files, either paper or electronic, by engineering or plan-
ning personnel.

                         LABOR STANDARD REVIEW REQUIREMENTS

A6.1. Purpose. If a labor standard review is required, each labor standard review must be annotated with
the name of the responsible industrial engineering technician and the date the standard was reviewed. The
names of any personnel consulted during the technical review must also be listed. The documentation
requirements for the calculations of Personal, Fatigue & Delay (PF&D) and labor efficiency factor are
also included, since both are covered in AFMCI 21-105 as part of work measurement. PF&D must only
be recalculated if the allowance is dependent on the workload mix, such as an aircraft work center where
a percentage of the planes are worked outside; otherwise, PF&D should be revalidated during the review.
While it is up to the centers to decide which organization is responsible for projecting the labor efficiency
factor, it is important that organization maintain supporting documentation, since this factor directly
affects end item sales price.

A6.2. Technical Orders (T.O.).
   A6.2.1. Verify the current TO number is valid, and check all changes to the TO since the last review.
   A6.2.2. If there are no changes to the tech order since the last review, annotate this fact. If there have
   been changes, an annotation should be made as to whether the changes affect the standard.
   Examples of annotations:
       1. T.O. 00-125-2346 change no. 6 dated 28 Feb 2007 was reviewed. There were no changes to
          the process since the previous review.
       2. T.O. 00-125-2346 change no. 6 dated 28 Feb 2007 was reviewed. The changes were discussed
          during the labor standard/occurrence factor/work control document (WCD) review.

A6.3. Work Control Document (WCD). Review the WCD, with technical personnel where required
and make an annotation.
Examples of annotations:
   1. The WCD was reviewed with Joe Smith/LAPNE and no changes were required.
   2. The WCD was reviewed with Joe Smith/LAPNE and was revised on 1 Mar 2007 based on
      changes to the T.O.

A6.4. Labor Standard Hours. Labor standard hours will be validated through one of the following
methods:
   1. Work sampling study, time study, or other engineering technique.
   2. Variance analysis comparing actual direct labor hours required to standard hours.
   3. Estimate. Estimates must be accomplished at a level of work units that allows confidence in the
      validity of the estimate.
Examples of annotations:
30                                                                        AFMCI21-105 30 APRIL 2008


     1. Due to the addition of a new cleaning step to sub-operation 0010 in the latest revision to the T. O.
        the sub-operation time was increased from 1.2 to 1.5 hours per discussion with the engineer John
        Johnson/ LAEA.
     2. There were no requirement or process changes since the last review; therefore the current stan-
        dard of 6 hours is accurate, per discussion with the engineer John Johnson/LAEA.
     3. Analysis of actual direct labor hours required for FY07 showed the operation is actually taking an
        average of 5.75 hours. After discussion with Jimmy Jones/LAEC the standard is reduced by 0.25
        hours.

A6.5. Occurrence Factor. Occurrence factors should be validated against current, forecast technical/
failure changes, or recent historical data. Either an annotation should be made or a copy of the report
showing the occurrence factor should be added to the file.
Example of annotation:
The E046B occurrence factor report for commodities dated 15 Oct 07 showed an actual occurrence factor
for the operation to be 0.80 for the last 12 months. Following analysis it was determined that the opera-
tional occurrence will continue at the 0.80 level. The occurrence factor was updated 1 Nov 98.

A6.6. PF&D. PF&D allowances must be calculated by resource control center (RCC)/skill code.
Examples of annotations in the PF&D calculations themselves:
     1. Reviewed shop conditions with the supervisor Jim Jones/LIPEM. Shop conditions have not
        changed so the previous PF&D of 10% is still valid.
     2. Reviewed shop conditions with the supervisor Jim Jones/LIPEM. Due to new environmental
        requirements additional personal protection equipment (PPE) is required, so the PF&D was recal-
        culated to 14% .

NOTES:
PF&D allowances are applied to standards at the sub-operation level for exchangeables and operation
level for aircraft. As a minimum, a sub-operation/operation is defined as a work unit performed at one
work station with one skill level. If the unit is moved to another work station, or a different skill level is
required (e.g. system test to repair), a new sub-operation/operation must be established to allow PF&D to
be applied. When non-engineered standards are based on actual hours or estimates, it must be clear from
the documentation that PF&D was not double-counted.
Examples of annotations for the labor standards:
1. The standard of 50 hours is based on average actual hours for FY97; therefore the PF&D is included in
the estimate.
2. The standard of 1.5 hours is an estimate which did not include a PF&D allowance; therefore a 10%
PF&D was added to each sub-operation. PF&D calculations are on file in the planning office.
3. The standard is engineered; a 10% PF&D was added to each sub-operation. PF&D calculations are on
file in the section office.
AFMCI21-105 30 APRIL 2008                                                                                 31


A6.7. Shop Flow Days (Commodities). The shop flow day calculation should be reviewed. If there
were any changes to any of the factors going in to the formula, the shop flow days should be recalculated.
Since indirect factors ("I" in the formula) are recalculated on an annual basis, it is important to calculate
the formula with the latest factors. An annotation should be made, or a copy of the calculations attached.
Example of annotation:
Since the last review the indirect factor changed from 91% to 87%. The shop flow day calculations were
revised accordingly.

A6.8. Engineered Labor Standards. In addition to the above requirements, engineered labor standards
must accomplish the following to maintain their status:
   1. A methods validation will be accomplished. This will include sufficient observations of the ele-
      ments to verify or to change their descriptions.
   2. Current workplace layouts will be compared to the layouts on file to determine if any changes
      have occurred.
If either of these two factors changed, the appropriate portion of the work measurement study will be
re-accomplished and documented.

A7.1. Refer to Table A7.1., Sample Size and Rejection Criteria. Enter table with the number of active
standards in the area being sampled (i.e., 1500 active standards, use 1201 to 3200 range).

A7.2. Read the sample size to take (i.e., 125). Find the number of rejected standards that requires rejec-
tion of the entire batch (i.e., 22). When a batch fails the entire population is considered to have similar
flaws. The remedial actions to correct the sample batch need to be applied to the general population. A
resample must be taken to confirm acceptable results.

A7.3. This group of standards (i.e., 125) may be prioritized by workload volume, but at least 25 percent
of the sample must address the total range of standards.

A7.4. The following criteria are used to determine if an individual labor standard is accepted or rejected.
Defects will be classified as critical, major, or minor. Any sampled standard that has one critical defect or
four major defects will be considered a reject. No limitation is placed upon the number of minor defects a
sample can have.
     A7.4.1. Critical defects.
        A7.4.1.1. Standard method is not commensurate with method being used.

     A7.4.1.2. The total of any sub-operations that are left out, or included but no longer required by
     TO, have an impact greater than the accuracy requirements on the standard being evaluated.

                            SELECTING STANDARDS TO ENGINEER


Initial Assumptions:
1. Engineered labor standards are 14.6% to 34% lower than non-engineered standards.
Sources: The 14.6% is from Industrial Engineering, September 1973
Benjamin W Niebel, Motion and Time Study, and DoD IG Audit Report No. 95-049, found 25%.
DoD IG Audit Report 91-039 on airframes found non-engineered standards were overstated by 34%.
2. It takes 10 to 12 hours to engineer one DPSH, depending on the technique used.
Source: historical data for AFMC.
As an example, assuming a 14.6 percent productivity increase, and 12 hours to engineer one DPSH, for a
1 to 1 return on investment, you would engineer any operation which is performed at least 12/0.146 times
per year, or 82 times.
For a payback period of 2 years, you would engineer any operation which is performed at least 12/0.292
times per year, or 41 times. A payback period of 3 years would engineer any operation which is performed
more than 27 times per year.
It is suggested that several pilot studies be performed at each center on a sample of high-volume opera-
tions, and data kept on hour’s expended/standard changes. This new data could then be used instead of the
above mentioned assumptions to provide a more accurate return on investment projection for each indi-
vidual center.
Examples:
Standard=100 hours, workload=100
Cost to engineer=100X12=1200 hrs
Savings=10,000X14.6%=1460 hrs/yr
Payback=1200/1460=0.82yrs
Standard=2000 hours, workload=10
Cost to engineer=2000X12=24,000 hrs
Savings=20,000X14.6%=2920 hrs/yr
Payback=24,000/2920=8.22 years
You would want to engineer the first example, because it provides payback in one-tenth the time of the
second example, even though the second example has a higher DPSH.

                  PERSONAL, FATIGUE, AND DELAY (PF&D) ALLOWANCES

A9.1. General.
   A9.1.1. Personal, Fatigue, and Delay (PF&D) is the time allowed a worker to compensate for attend-
   ing to personal needs, for fatigue, and for delay occurring due to conditions beyond his control. This
   time is additive to the normal time required to accomplish a job. The inclusion of this allowance is
   common practice in the development of a labor standard. Present practices for computing PF&D have
   resulted in varied interpretation of the factors being considered and the use of different techniques to
   establish them. Variances in application range from an allowance for each element within a standard
   to the adoption of a fixed or blanket allowance for all standards in an organization or activity. As a
   result of these different practices, standards for identical work are inconsistent and result in different
   measurement criteria for identical jobs or functions and incomparable data at the summary levels. In
   order to minimize these variances, it is necessary to establish a standardized method of computing the
   PF&D allowances. The guidelines for developing allowances portrayed in this attachment have been
   accepted and used extensively for some time throughout the DOD, and are established as the standard-
   ized method.
   A9.1.2. Where appropriate, a fixed PF&D allowance based on the standardized method may be devel-
   oped one time for a specific function or for groups of personnel doing similar work under similar con-
   ditions. The fixed allowance applies to all standards in the function or group and precludes the need to
   individually compute the allowance for each standard. In work situations where the guidelines are not
   applicable, the fixed allowance will be developed through work measurement techniques such as time
   study or work sampling.
   A9.1.3. The development and application of PF&D allowances requires that the various conditions
   under which a job is performed be examined and considered. To insure that all conditions are consid-
   ered, separate factors are provided for each of the three areas: Personal, Fatigue, and Delay. Analysts/
   technicians must be completely objective in establishing the allowances which correctly reflect the
   true situations inherent to the job.

A9.2. Allowances for Personal Time. Consider the surroundings, working conditions, and job require-
ments which cause the employee to stop work from time to time to attend to necessary personal needs (go
to restroom, get a drink of water, get fresh air, etc). Since most operations allow two breaks of 10 minutes
each during the 480-minutes shift, the basic allowance for this factor will be 4.2 percent (20.0 minutes). If
facilities layout or management policy dictate that longer break periods are required, it will be necessary
to re-compute the percentage for the basic allowance subject to approval of higher authority.
                                                                                     Percent
Basic Allowance                                                                        4.2

Exposed to extremely disagreeable conditions most of the time. Proximity to
hot objects, continuous exposure to disagreeable odors and fumes, or to

Add the following where applicable:
e. Where time is allowed by management at the beginning of the shift to make ready and/or at the end of
the shift to get/put away tools and equipment, clean up work area, or to don/remove special work clothing
(aprons, smocks, etc.) allowances are as follows:

TOTAL MINUTES ALLOWED FOR % ALLOWANCE
PREPARATION AND CLEANUP
                       5                               1.0

f. In "super-clean" room conditions, supplement these allowances with an adjunctive allowance. Required
when operators must utilize special clothing, which includes caps, boots, etc., and remove it when leaving
work area. This includes time to invest or divest special clothing at beginning and ending of shift, at
lunch, and for personal requirements                             4.0
g. Where the work period is 8 consecutive hours and 20 minute lunch period is allowed at the expense of
the government                                                 4.2

A9.3. Allowances for Fatigue.
     A9.3.1. Physical. Consider the average weight handled per man and only those elements of time that
     the man is under load to determine percentage (total time for under load elements divided by base time
     and use the closest percentage on the chart). Also, consider the height that loads must be manually
     lifted (average situation).

   Table values will be multiplied by the following factors as dictated by conditions:
   For picking up loads from floor, multiply basic allowance by                1.10
   For placing load above chest-height, multiply basic allowance by            1.20
   For getting load from above chest-height, multiply basic allowance by       0.50
   The application of the factors from this table in the computation formula in section A9.5. will nor-
   mally provide a realistic PF&D allowance. However, in some instances the use of these factors results
   in an unrealistic, zero or negative denominator in the formula. When this occurs, assuming all factors
   are defined correctly, it will be necessary to combine related elements or standards into higher levels
   until a realistic allowance is obtained. "Realistic" is defined as an allowance acceptable to the worker,
   the supervisor, and the analyst.
   b. To determine the effective net weight for sliding or rolling objects the weight must be multiplied by
   the following coefficients of friction (average values):
Surface                              Friction Coefficient
Wood on Wood                                 0.4
Wood on Metal                                0.4
Metal on Metal                               0.3
Example: Worker sliding a 40 lb. casting from metal conveyor to wooden work bench.
ENW = 40 lbs. x .4 = 16 lbs.
   c. Position. Consider the position which the employees must assume to perform the operation. Select
   the class which best describes the average condition. It is assumed that the job will be less tiresome if
   the position can be varied frequently.

A9.4. Allowances for Delay. Consider the job in relation to adjacent jobs--how long can any adjacent job
be shut down before the job being studied is affected? Also, consider other delays inherent in the job, such
as supervisory interruptions, moving from one work station to another, waiting for cranes, etc. No delays
which can be prevented by the employee should be considered here.
   A9.4.1. Basic Allowance.
Class                                                                Percent

   A9.4.2. Balancing Delay. Where employees are required to move from one work station to another to
   balance adjacent stations, add the following:
a. Move once each 5 minutes                                            5

     A9.4.3. Special Delay Allowances.
        A9.4.3.1. Except for the above, there will be no predetermined or generally used delay allowance
        percent that is applied without an engineered backup study. An appropriate study must be con-
        ducted in each shop or functional area to ascertain additional delay allowance requirements.
        A9.4.3.2. All non-cyclic work elements will be apportioned in the manner that will most accu-
        rately add their cost to the product cost. Work elements such as cleaning chips and tool care and
        replacement, though occurring on an irregular basis, can be measured and the time required pro-
        rated directly to the machine operating portion of the work cycle rather than as an allowance. Cer-
        tain other irregular occurring elements having a direct relationship to the job, such as obtaining
        parts and materials and periodic inspection, should be added to the cycle time on a prorated basis
        or as a separate work element rather than added as an allowance. Again, care should be taken to
        assure that there is no duplication between cycle time elements and allowance elements. The delay
        allowance must not be used as a "dumping ground" for operation activity not an integral part of the
        work load in the shop.
        A9.4.3.3. Special delay allowance elements fall into two categories: (1) those which occur on a
        non-foreseeable basis (power failure, minor repairs to defective parts, wait for job assignment),
        and (2) those which occur on a time basis (daily, weekly, hourly). The following are examples of
        the type of special delay which can be considered for allowance:
            1. Obtain job information from supervisor, inspector or production control.
            2. Wait for special tools already being used if waiting time cannot be eliminated.
            3. Power failure of non-reportable duration.
            4. Work interference.
            5. Minor rework elements if not caused by operator error.
            6. Extra work required due to hidden part or material defects, if minor.
            7. Unsuccessful hunts for parts or materials.
            8. Machine breakdown of non-reportable duration.

A9.5. Application of Allowance.
     A9.5.1. Expression as Percentage. The factors provided in this procedure are expressed as a percent-
     age of 480 minutes (eight hours). Since the productive time in the work day is a variable inversely pro-
     portional to the amount of PF&D allowance, it is necessary that all factors are expressed as a
     percentage of the total work day in order to provide a constant base. It is therefore necessary that all
     locally determined factors are similarly expressed.
     A9.5.2. Computation Procedures.
        A9.5.2.1. Percent of Work Day. The application of the allowances requires that the total percent
        of PF&D allowance be determined first by adding the percentage for the applicable factors of the
        productive day before it can be applied. This is accomplished by dividing the total work day by the
        productive day expressed as a percent of the work day, i.e.,
AFMCI21-105 30 APRIL 2008                                                                               41


Allowance Factor =                            100%
                                100% - allowance (% of the work day)
Example: Assume all factors total 15 percent allowance (this is 72 minutes of the 480 minute work day).
Converting this allowance to a percentage of the productive day (408 min.) results in an allowance of 17.6
percent.
Allowance Factor =       100%         = 100%         = 1.176
                       100% - 15%             85%
If allowances are expressed in minutes:
Allowance Factor =     480 min.       =        480 min. = 1.176
                       480-72 min.             408 min.
       A9.5.2.2. Application to Normal Time. The final step in the application of the allowance is to
       multiply the normal time by the allowance factor. For example, assume the rated productive time
       to be 408 minutes, the job standard would be:
       408 minutes X 1.176 = 480 minute
   A9.5.3. Examples of Application.
       A9.5.3.1. Unloading Boxes from Truck
a. Job Conditions - Crew is unloading boxes from a truck and placing them on a pallet and the following
conditions are in effect:
(1) The operation is performed at a warehouse ramp.
(2) The boxes weigh 25 pounds each and the employee is under load 25% of the time.
The boxes are being taken from stacks slightly higher than his waist and are placed on pallets resting on
the truck bed.
The work is purely routine.
The employee walks approximately five feet with each box.
The cycle time (per box) is .500 minutes, actual under load elements equal .125 minutes (if per pallet the
% may be somewhat less).

be computed as follows: 0.500 x 1.179 = 0.590 standard minutes. The number of decimal places used
would depend on the time increments used in the man hour accounting system and the volume of produc-
tion.
