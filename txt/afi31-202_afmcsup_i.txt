2.1. Purpose of MWD Program. MWDs provide Security Forces the capability to enforce
military laws and regulations, suppress the use of illegal drugs, detect explosives, and protect
installations and resources during peacetime, war, and in support of operations other than war.
2.2. MWD Authorizations, Requisitions, and Dispositions.
   2.2.1. For guidance on requisition and disposition of MWDs, see AFMAN 23-110, Volume
   2, Part 2, Chapters 9 and 22, USAF Supply Manual and AFJI 23-224 DOD Military Working
   Dog (MWD) Program.
       2.2.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Upon ordering an MWD, forward the order requisition
       number to HQ AFMC/A7SOT.
       2.2.1.2. (Added-AFMC) If an MWD is medically unable to perform duties, kennel
       masters must obtain a ―one-year-out‖ letter from the base veterinarian that includes the
       canine’s prognosis and the life expectancy. This letter will be submitted to 341
       TRS/DOL with the AF Form 601, "Equipment Action Request," with a courtesy copy
       sent to HQ AFMC/A7SOT.
   2.2.2. As a baseline, installations are authorized 4 to 6 explosive detector dogs. Drug
   detector dogs will not exceed one-third of the unit’s total MWD authorizations. Exceptions
   may be based on operational requirements, existing manpower/MWD authorizations, base
   population and geography, or other unit-specific requirements. Exceptions and changes will
   be staffed as variances and approved by the MAJCOM A7S and must be coordinated through
   HQ AFSFC. Standards will specify the manpower authorizations for kennel masters,
   trainers, and handlers. The wing manpower office will validate MWD manpower
   authorizations. However, the following matrix is a recommended kennel leadership and
   support mix based on the number of authorized dogs:

2.3. Certification of MWD Handlers, Kennel Masters, and Trainers:
      2.3.1. MWD handlers must be graduates of the 341 TRS MWD Handler Course. Training
      done by private businesses or civilian police departments is not a substitute for the DOD
      MWD handler course.
      2.3.2. Personnel, regardless of rank, who laterally retrain to become MWD handlers, must
      complete the MWD Handler Course and enter upgrade training to the ―5‖ skill level. Before
      being awarded the 3P051A Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC), the MWD handler must
      complete all upgrade requirements, including the MWD Handler Career Development
      Course, and all task items for the ―5‖ skill level in the MWD Handler Career Field Education
      and Training Plan.
      2.3.3. Kennel masters and trainers must be graduates of the 341 TRS MWD Trainer/Kennel
      Masters Course or be scheduled to attend within 90 days of assignment as kennel master or
      trainer. To be eligible to attend this course, personnel must be awarded the AFSC 3P051A.
      2.3.4. (Added-AFMC) Personnel selected to fill the kennel master or MWD trainer position
      will have, at a minimum, 24 months experience as an MWD handler. If personnel meeting
      this standard are not available, the SFS unit commander may waive the requirement in
      writing.
2.4. Permanent Administrative Records. The kennel master maintains the following
permanent administrative records on MWDs:
      2.4.1. DD Form 1834, Military Working Dog Service Record. The 341 TRS initiates this
      form, which stays with the dog throughout its lifetime. If the form must be redone, attach the
      original to the new form.
      2.4.2. AF Form 321, Military Working Dog Training and Utilization Record.
            2.4.2.1. (Added-AFMC) MWDs will be used on a daily basis when their assigned
            handlers are working. Make an entry on the reverse of AF Form 321, Military Working
            Dog Training and Utilization Record, explaining periods of non-use. At a minimum,
            annotations showing the handler’s posting, training locations, type of gunfire training
            conducted, and reasons why the Optimum Training Schedule (OTS) were not met will be
            included on the reverse side of the form.
      2.4.3. AF Form 323, Military Working Dog Training and Utilization Record for
      Drug/Explosive Detector Dogs.
AFI31-202_AFMCSUP_I 16 DECEMBER 2010                                                               9


   2.4.4. AF Form 324, Military Working Dog Program Status Report. This report is due to
   HQ AFSFC quarterly through the MAJCOM MWD Action Officer. NOTE: Refer to the
   AFMAN 31-219, USAF Military Working Dog (MWD) Program, for specific information on
   these and other program specific forms.
      2.4.4.1. (Added-AFMC) Submit AF Form 324, Military Working Dog Program Status
      Report, via e-mail to HQ AFMC/A7SOT NLT, 30 March, 30 June, 30 September, and 30
      December of each year or as otherwise requested.
      2.4.4.2. (Added-AFMC) AF Form 324, Section III: This area must show all 3P0X1As
      assigned to the unit regardless of rank. This includes all personnel not working in the
      MWD section. Annotate all handlers assigned in Section VI, Handlers Information.
      2.4.4.3. (Added-AFMC) AF Form 324, Section VI, Military Working Dog Information:
      In addition to the name of the Military Working Dog, the Deployment Category for the
      MWD will be annotated (e.g., Marco – Cat 2).
      2.4.4.4. (Added-AFMC) Using the established MAJCOM template, provide monthly
      TRP program status reports (or as requested) to HQ AFMC/A7SOT NLT the 30th of
      every month.
2.5. Safety Procedures. Safety procedures must be followed to protect MWDs as well as
people who come in contact with dogs. Safety rules include:
   2.5.1. Establish and enforce controls to prevent MWDs from getting loose in the MWD
   Kennel Facility.
   2.5.2. Keep a safe distance between MWD teams.
   2.5.3. Do not use a leash to secure a MWD to any object.
   2.5.4. Before entering veterinary clinics, permission will be granted by the clinic staff.
   Muzzle dog before entering.
   2.5.5. Check dog frequently if it is left unattended in a temporary kennel or shipping crate.
   2.5.6. Use only the leather collar and kennel chain to stake a dog out.
   2.5.7. Do not secure the dog to any movable object, especially a vehicle.
   2.5.8. Do not stake the dog out where it could injure itself or others.
   2.5.9. Put dogs in the shade during hot weather and ensure adequate water is available.
   2.5.10. Remove leather collar and choke chain while dogs are in kennel run. The leather
   collar will remain on the MWD when kenneled in a vari-kennels/shipping crates.
   2.5.11. Use a ―one-way system‖ in the kennel. This system may be shown by ground/wall
   signs or explained in the kennel operating instructions.
      2.5.11.1. (Added-AFMC) Each kennel facility must contain a clearly identified ―one-
      way system‖ and each person associated with the MWD program must adhere to the
      established system.
   2.5.12. Provide bilingual safety instructions for local national personnel performing kennel
   duties where applicable.
 10                                           AFI31-202_AFMCSUP_I 16 DECEMBER 2010


   2.5.13. Handlers will maintain a short leash when in close proximity (six feet) to other
   personnel.
   2.5.14. When an MWD team could unexpectedly encounter a bystander, such as walking or
   running around blind corners, using stairs, or passing an open door, the handler will warn
   others by announcing ―DOG COMING AROUND‖ – ―DOG COMING BY‖ – ―DOG
   COMING UP/DOWN‖.
2.6. Transporting MWDs in Vehicles.
   2.6.1. Vehicle Markings. Mark MWD vehicles IAW TO 36-1-191/ Technical and
   Managerial Reference for Motor Vehicle Maintenance, Chap 2.84.6.4. In foreign countries,
   the sign must also be written in the language of the host country. Do not use signs in
   deployed hostile locations.
   2.6.2. Four-door full sized vehicles are best suited for MWD operations. Mobile MWD
   teams should be assigned a law enforcement full size 4-door sedan or other full size 4-door
   passenger-type vehicle (Sport/Utility or station wagon). While on patrol, the dog may be
   off leash in the rear seat area. Never tie the dog to the vehicle. Use a stable platform (with a
   nonskid surface) to help the dog maintain balance. Commercial canine vehicle inserts are
   recommended for use in assigned vehicles.
   2.6.3. MWDs may be transported in a portable kennel or shipping crate in the bed of a truck
   without a camper shell for short trips on base only. Examples would be to the veterinary
   clinic or MWD demonstrations, etc. Pickup trucks are not to be used for daily operations
   with the MWD in the bed. When using a pickup truck to transport a MWD in a portable
   kennel or shipping crate, they must be secured to the bed of the truck.
   2.6.4. MWDs may be transported in privately owned vehicles (POV) with prior approval
   from the CSF. Approval must be in writing and POVs will only be used as a last resort for
   emergency purposes, not convenience.
   2.6.4. (AFMC) MWDs may be transported in privately owned vehicles (POV) with prior
   approval from the CSF. Approval must be in writing and POVs will only be used as a last
   resort for emergency purposes, not convenience. Before approval by the CSF the vehicle
   must be sanitized according to veterinarian instructions if a pet has been transported in that
   vehicle previously.
   2.6.5. Vehicles used to routinely transport MWDs must be air-conditioned.
   2.6.6. MWD vehicles used for patrol will be separate and distinct from the kennel support
   vehicle(s) used for transportation of explosive training aids and other support functions.
   2.6.7. Do not transport MWD in any vehicle that has been used to transport stray animals
   until the vehicle has been thoroughly sanitized according to veterinarian instructions. Do not
   use MWD handlers or kennel support personnel to capture stray animals or maintain base
   stray animal shelters or pet boarding facilities.
   2.6.7. (AFMC) Do not transport MWDs in any vehicle that has been used to transport stray
   animals until the vehicle has been thoroughly sanitized according to veterinarian instructions.
   Do not use MWD handlers or kennel support personnel to capture stray animals or maintain
   base stray animal shelters or pet boarding facilities. MWD equipped vehicles will not be
   utilized to transport strays.
AFI31-202_AFMCSUP_I 16 DECEMBER 2010                                                           11


   2.6.8. Do not leave dogs unattended in vehicles. Exceptions: If the mission requires it and
   there is no other alternative or if directed by competent authority (Kennel Master, Flight
   Chief, Flight Leader, etc). In these situations, the dog must be left in a marked MWD
   vehicle. Additionally, the handler must set the parking brake, leave the engine running, set
   the thermostat for the appropriate climate and ensure the fan is on high, secure the vehicle,
   and have a means (spare key) to immediately access the vehicle if the dog should become
   distressed. MWDs should be checked on every 15 minutes should they be left in a vehicle
   unattended. Leaving an MWD unattended in a vehicle will be a last resort.
2.7. Shipping MWDs.
   2.7.1. A veterinary health certificate must accompany the dog when it is shipped across state
   lines or international borders. Health certificates are valid for 10 days only. If travel is
   delayed, issue another certificate.
   2.7.2. When shipping dogs in crates, mark the top of the crate with the name and tattoo of
   the dog. Note that the kennel should only be opened by a qualified handler. Include
   information on how to contact the handler accompanying the dog in case of emergency.
   Markings should be large enough to read from a safe distance. The top and sides of the
   crates should be labeled ―Danger – Military Working Dog.‖ Bi-lingual warnings should be
   utilized when shipping MWDs to overseas locations.
   2.7.3. Load crates for maximum ventilation and never place baggage on top of or around
   crate. Never place the crate on top of other baggage or stack crates more than two high. Do
   not load dogs into crates which have been standing in the sun. When transporting MWDs in
   shipping crates during hot weather, use air-conditioned or well-ventilated vehicles. Make
   sure there is an adequate supply of fresh water for the dogs. Do not lock shipping crates;
   however, make sure the crates cannot be opened inadvertently.
   2.7.4. When traveling with MWDs, they should be referred to as ―Federal Service Dogs‖.
   2.7.5. Ship the dog as excess baggage when the team travels on commercial aircraft. Dogs
   will travel in the cargo hold of commercial aircraft. Handlers will stay with assigned MWD
   and will make every effort to ensure MWD is being loaded onto the same flight. Ask airline
   stewards/stewardess prior to departure to check if MWD is loaded into the cargo hold of the
   aircraft. The only exception is if the airline imposes a heat/cold embargo, or small regional
   airports that do not accept large kennels. In this case, dogs may travel in the passenger cabin
   with the handler, but must be muzzled and on leash, under continuous control of the handler,
   for the duration of the flight and only as a last resort.
   2.7.6. When MWDs are shipped unaccompanied, kennel masters will check with the base
   transportation office and complete all required forms. The shipper will attach detailed
   instructions to the crate on how to feed and water MWDs. The MWD must be attended until
   it is loaded onboard the aircraft.
   2.7.7. Handlers will escort and take care of MWDs moved on military aircraft. Contact local
   passenger service representatives for instructions. If kennel facilities are required during
   stopovers at other bases, coordinate in advance with the kennel master. Do not route MWDs
   through Guam, United Kingdom, or other locations with animal quarantine regulations,
   unless MWD is being assigned to MWD sections in these locations. MWDs entering the
   European Union (EU) (see Attachment 4) from countries not listed in the Regulation of the
12                                        AFI31-202_AFMCSUP_I 16 DECEMBER 2010


  European Parliament and the Council of European Union, Annex II part C of Regulation
  (EC) No 998/2003 (Attachment 5) are required to be accompanied by:
     2.7.7.1. EU Form 998 – Veterinary Certificate for domestic dogs, cats and ferrets
     entering the European Community for non-commercial movements. Ask your
     veterinarian for a copy of the form for the specific country to which you are traveling.
     You can also contact the US State Department or the embassy of the country to which
     you are traveling and request an EU Form 998. You can often get the form mailed or
     faxed to you from embassy personnel.
     2.7.7.2. Proof of a rabies neutralizing anti-body vaccination or revaccination if
     applicable per the recommendation of the manufacturing lab, with an inactivated vaccine
     of at least one antigenic unit per dose.
     2.7.7.3. A copy of the dogs Fluorescent Antibody Virus Neutralization (FAVN) test
     results.
     2.7.7.4. (Added-AFMC) MWD teams diverted to locations with animal quarantine
     regulations MUST contact HQ AFMC/A7SOT immediately.

                           CONTROLLING AND USING MWDS

3.1. Controlling MWDs. Handlers will maintain positive control of their MWD at all times.
When applicable, handlers will ensure persons are warned of the potential dangers associated
with an MWD. Do not allow people to pet MWDs.
3.1. (AFMC) Controlling MWDs. Handlers will maintain positive control of their MWD at all
times. When applicable, handlers will ensure persons are warned of the potential dangers
associated with an MWD. Do not allow people to pet MWDs. Only qualified MWD personnel
are authorized to handle MWDs.
   3.1.1. Keep MWDs on leash except when they must chase and/or bite and hold a suspect or
   search an unoccupied building. Always maintain positive control of dogs when off leash.
   Before releasing the dog to search a suspected building, give a verbal warning stating the dog
   is about to be released.
   3.1.2. During the following situations, handlers must warn people that their dog is trained to
   bite with or without command:
       3.1.2.1. Challenging an individual.
       3.1.2.2. Approaching a suspect.
       3.1.2.3. Checking a person's identification.
       3.1.2.4. Participating in any situation that requires the handler to divert attention from
       control of the dog.
   3.1.3. Relinquish control of the dog only to other trained handlers or veterinary personnel
   who are competent to handle the animal. Should no other qualified handler or vet be
   available, muzzle the MWD and relinquish control to any Security Forces personnel so the
   MWD can be transported back to the kennel facility.
3.2. Releasing MWDs. Release of an MWD to bite or allowing it to bite is considered use of
force, although is not considered use of deadly force. Use the reasonable amount of force
necessary to accomplish the task. (For further information on how and where the MWD fits into
the overall use of force spectrum, refer to AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force
Personnel.)
   3.2.1. MWD teams will be validated through training that the dog will ―stand-off‖ upon
   command and obey the command ―OUT‖. If a MWD performs unsatisfactorily in either of
   these tasks, the unit Operations Officer or higher must issue a ―no release‖ order to the
   handler, specifically outlining the dog will not be released to affect an apprehension under
   any circumstances. Post this order in the MWD’s permanent records until the dog has been
   properly trained and reevaluated satisfactorily at which time the ―no release‖ order may be
   rescinded. The dog may remain operational during the remedial training only after being
   issued the ―no release order‖. (See para 7.1.4)
   3.2.2. Before releasing an MWD, make sure the dog has identified the same target that the
   handler intends for it to bite and hold. Give the warning order, "Halt or I will release my
 14                                            AFI31-202_AFMCSUP_I 16 DECEMBER 2010


   dog.‖ In foreign countries, also give this order in the primary language of the host country.
   Overseas units must include training in the host nation language warning order in their MWD
   handler certification program. Also, warn bystanders to cease all movement before releasing
   the dog.
   3.2.3. The handler must follow the dog as closely as possible when the MWD is released to
   bite and hold. Once the suspect stops or indicates surrender, call the dog off pursuit. If the
   dog fails to come OUT and assume the GUARD or HEEL position, regain immediate control
   of the dog. Use extreme caution when removing an MWD from a suspect. If necessary,
   choke the MWD off the individual. Do not jerk or pull the dog. Regain and keep leash
   control of the dog until it has become calm enough to obey the commands to HEEL and
   STAY.
   3.2.4. Handlers will not release their dogs if the suspect is not in sight, except as specified in
   paragraph 3.1.1. Handlers will not release MWDs in areas where children are present,
   except as a last resort short of the use of deadly force. Do not release MWDs into a crowd of
   people.
3.3. Using MWDs. Each CSF will establish local procedures on using MWDs. These
procedures must conform to this instruction, applicable Status of Forces Agreements, or other
country-to-country agreements.
   3.3.1. The ―one-handler, one-dog‖ rule is the norm when assigning and matching dog teams.
   However, there are exceptions to this rule. When a handler is on temporary duty (TDY) or
   on leave, it is the kennel master’s responsibility to ensure the dog is regularly exercised and
   groomed and that proficiency training is conducted. Also, during an emergency situation
   (bomb threat, etc), the kennel master or trainer may use another handler’s dog (explosive
   detector dog only), if a certified handler is not immediately available. The decision to do so
   rests with the kennel master based upon knowledge of the dog and of the situation. Also,
   during personnel shortages, a qualified handler may work more than one dog only after ALL
   assigned handlers and kennel personnel have been assigned to dogs.

                                  MWD TEAM TRAINING

4.1. MWD Team General Proficiency Training. As an Air Force standard, each duty cycle
should include the training needed to maintain team proficiency. When possible, conduct
training on post. Kennel masters will develop an Optimum Training Schedule (OTS) for each
dog. Each OTS will state the minimum proficiency training required per dog, per month, for
each required task based on MWD team’s proficiency level. Minimum training may change
depending on changes in the team’s proficiency level.
   4.1.1. Kennel masters and trainers will conduct patrol and explosives/narcotics detection
   training. Patrol training includes training on the obstacle course, unless the local veterinarian
   waives the requirement for medical reasons. See AFMAN 31-219 for training procedures on
   gunfire, obedience, and aggression.
       4.1.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Annotate temporary waivers for the obstacle course on the AF
       Form 321. Annotate permanent waivers in the medical records.
4.2. MWD Team Detection Training. The 341 TRS establishes the type of response and
reward for each initially certified dog. Notify the 341 TRS Dog Training Section of any change
to the response or reward. Drug detector dogs (DDDs) will not be trained to detect explosives
and explosive detector dogs (EDDs) will not be trained to detect drugs. Do not train drug and
explosive detector dogs in the same areas unless at least 72 hours have elapsed.
   4.2.1. With MAJCOM MWD Action Officer approval, field units may locally train a patrol
   dog that shows potential as a narcotic or explosive detector dog. However, explosive
   detector dog washouts may never enter into drug detector training and vice versa. Once local
   training is completed, the dog must complete initial certification as a detector dog. Initial
   certification requirements are more stringent than probable cause certifications. Only the 341
   TRS can certify locally-trained explosive detector dogs. The requesting unit or MAJCOM
   will pay for the TDY expenses. Locally-trained DDDs may be certified by a Technical
   Sergeant or above, knowledgeable of the MWD Program and who is a graduate of the 341
   TRS MWD Handler Course or previous equivalent course. Request guidance from the 341
   TRS, Dog Training Section, for specific training protocol and certification requirements.
   4.2.2. After locally-trained detector dog teams are certified, the unit will forward a letter to
   the responsible MAJCOM MWD Action Officer requesting a change in National Stock
   Number (NSN). The MAJCOM MWD Action Officer will forward an endorsed copy of the
   letter to the 341 TRS and return the original to the unit. Following MAJCOM MWD Action
   Officer endorsement, the unit will process the request through base supply channels. Base
   supply will assign the appropriate NSN and provide the information to the unit. The unit will
   then annotate the new stock number on the DD Form 1834.
       4.2.2.1. (Added-AFMC) NSN change letters will be submitted to HQ AFMC/A7SOT.

                               EXPLOSIVE TRAINING AIDS

5.1. Explosive Training Aid Safety Precautions. Handling explosives is dangerous. Follow
mandatory safety requirements when training EDDs. Do not conduct training unless detailed
operating instructions that include safety procedures are developed. Explosives safety and
handling instructions must be coordinated through the installation safety office.
   5.1.1. The CSF will ensure involved personnel receive annual training in safely storing,
   transporting, and handling explosive training aids. Explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) or
   munitions safety personnel will conduct the training. If these personnel are unavailable, the
   kennel master will develop an annual safety briefing (with wing safety office assistance) and
   document training on all personnel involved in EDD training. Briefings will address
   requirements in AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Program, AFMAN 91-201,
   Explosive Safety Standards, and Technical Order (TO) 11A20-16-7, Canine Explosive Scent
   Kit. Take the following actions before removing explosive training aids and setting up
   training exercises:
      5.1.1.1. Coordinate in advance with the training location facility owners to minimize
      disruption of operations.
      5.1.1.2. Contact the base weather office before each training session. Do not conduct
      training when an electrical storm is within 5 miles of the training area.
      5.1.1.2. (AFMC) Contact the base weather office before each training session. Do not
      conduct training when an electrical storm is within 5 miles of the training area.
      Explosives operations must be terminated when lightning storms are detected within 10
      nautical miles.
      5.1.1.3. Notify the fire department, safety office, and the SF control center of the training
      location and the amount and type of explosives to be used.
      5.1.1.4. Post proper fire symbols and explosive operations signs around the training site
      so they are clearly visible from approach roads.
      5.1.1.5. Post warning signs stating "Danger--Explosive Dog Training in Progress--Keep
      Out." Signs will be locally made and measure approximately 3 by 3 feet, with red letters
      on a white background. In foreign countries, ensure the sign also shows this warning in
      the primary language of the host nation.
      5.1.1.6. When conducting explosives detector dog training in facilities or buildings,
      move all persons who are not actively involved in the training at least 100 feet from the
      explosives per AFMAN 91-201, para 12.79.
   5.1.2. Transport and handle explosive training aids per AFMAN 91-201.
   5.1.3. Do not place explosive training aids near heat or spark producing items, such as
   electrical wiring, radiators, electric heaters, heating vents, engine blocks, or exhaust systems.
   Avoid placing chlorates near water sources.
AFI31-202_AFMCSUP_I 16 DECEMBER 2010                                                               17


   5.1.4. Do not exceed the net explosive weight (NEW) of 15 pounds (total quantity) in any
   one training exercise site. The 15 pound NEW does not apply when transporting munitions
   to and from training locations. Chlorates are not included in the total quantity limitation.
   When using multiple training aids, place them at least ten feet apart and on some type of
   barrier material to avoid surface or aid contamination.
       5.1.4.1. Kennel master should work closely with local EOD to routinely conduct mass
       odor training with EDD teams.
   5.1.5. Leave aids in place only for the time necessary for odor dispersion, search, and
   recovery. Keep aids under constant watch at all times. Collect and account for all aids
   immediately after training.
   5.1.5. (AFMC) Leave aids in place only for the time necessary for odor dispersion, search,
   and recovery. Keep aids under constant watch at all times. Collect and account for all aids
   immediately after training. Conduct explosive training with the maximum amount of
   explosive detector dogs during each training exercise to limit the amount of times that
   explosive training aids must be removed from storage.
   5.1.6. Personnel must wear protective gloves when handling any explosive training aids.
   5.1.6. (AFMC) Personnel must wear protective gloves when handling any explosive
   training aids. Disposable gloves, similar to food handling gloves, will be used when
   handling the explosive training aids to limit aid contamination (Latex gloves will be used
   when handling nitro dynamite).
   5.1.7. Use de-humidifiers, desiccant packs, and/or safety-approved electric heaters in storage
   facilities to control temperature and reduce humidity.
   5.1.7. (AFMC) Use de-humidifiers, desiccant packs, and/or safety-approved electric heaters
   in storage facilities to control temperature and reduce humidity. Coordinate use of heaters
   and dehumidifiers with your munitions storage personnel and the wing explosive safety
   officer. If their use is not feasible, ensure proper rotation of the canine scent kit is being done
   to maximize the shelf life of the explosive training aids. Heat-producing devices (space
   heaters) WILL NOT be used where exposed explosives (smokeless powder being broken
   down) are present.
   5.1.8. Contact EOD or munitions personnel if there is any doubt about the safe condition of
   any training aid.
5.2. Explosive Training Aid Acquisition, Turn-In, and Storage. Units with EDDs will
conduct proficiency training using sodium and potassium chlorates and explosives in the Canine
Explosives Scent Kit (CESK) described in TO 11A20-16-7. NOTE: Training with odors or
substances other than those in the CESK must be approved by HQ AFSFC. All explosives
operations must be conducted in accordance with AFMAN 91-201, 7.28./Military Working Dog
Explosives and section 7B - Locally Written Instructions.
   5.2.1. Obtain chlorates through medical supply channels or local procurement. Three
   pounds of each chlorate per kennel is authorized. Units may repackage chlorates as
   necessary. Package training aids in moisture proof containers.

  5.2.2. Store chlorates per the Material Safety Data Sheets and information provided on the
  packaging. Chlorates may be stored at the kennel facility. Do not mix chlorates with other
  substances as they can form an explosive or spontaneously combustible mixture.
  5.2.3. The CSF will ensure:
     5.2.3.1. Training aids are available and procedures are in place for issue.
     5.2.3.2. Turn-in and storage are coordinated with the installation munitions supply
     officer.
     5.2.3.3. Explosives are stored according to AFI 31-101 and AFMAN 91-201.
     5.2.3.4. MAJCOMs complete arrangements for explosives’ supply, support, and storage
     before EDDs are assigned.
  5.2.4. Security Forces personnel are prohibited from cutting or dividing explosives training
  aids except detonator cord, smokeless powder, and chlorates, which may be repackaged as
  necessary. Contact EOD for guidance.
  5.2.5. Replace training aids as needed. Order all training aids according to AFCAT 21-209,
  Vol. 1, Ground Munitions. Contact EOD immediately to dispose of damaged or unsafe
  explosives. Consider chlorates contaminated and possibly hazardous if spilled or exposed to
  moisture. Comply with local environmental requirements for disposal of chlorates.
  5.2.6. (Added-AFMC) Explosive training aids in the Explosive Scent Kit will be replaced
  every 24 months or sooner if they are damaged, destroyed, or odor contaminated. Order each
  item individually for replacement through munitions storage personnel rather than ordering a
  complete Canine Explosive Scent Kit (CESK). The kennel master will ensure that training
  aids are forecasted annually IAW AFI 21-201.

                                  DRUG TRAINING AIDS

6.1. Physical Security Requirements of Drug Training Aids. Physical security requirements
for drug training aids are set in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Section 1301.72,
Physical Security Controls for Non-Practitioners; Narcotic Treatment Programs and
Compounders for Narcotic Treatment Programs; Storage Areas. Apply those physical
protection and control procedures to prevent misuse or theft of controlled substances used as
training aids.
   6.1.1. Each unit with drug training aids will keep a current copy of CFR 21, part 1300 to
   End.         CFR 21 can be found at the following internet address:
   www.gpoaccess.gov/cfr/index.html                                                       or
   www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCFR/CFRSearch.cfm.
   6.1.2. The CSF will appoint primary and alternate drug custodians in writing to the Armed
   Forces Institute of Pathology, Armed Forces Medical Examiners System, Division of
   Forensics Toxicology (AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX). Drug custodians must be graduates of the
   341 TRS MWD Trainer/Kennel Masters Course.
6.2. Registration to Procure Drug Training Aids. To receive drug training aids, all SF units
must be registered with the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP). Send registration
requests through the respective MAJCOM MWD Action Officer to AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX.
Include the installation location (country), number of DDDs authorized, rank/pay grade, name
and social security numbers of the primary and alternate drug custodians. The registration
request must also include a complete unit address, telephone number, fax number, and e-mail
address if available.
6.2. (AFMC)Registration to Procure Drug Training Aids. To receive drug training aids, all
SF units must be registered with the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP). Send
registration requests through the respective MAJCOM MWD Action Officer to
AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX. Requests will be routed through HQ AFMC/A7SOT. Include the
installation location (country), number of DDDs authorized, rank/pay grade, name and social
security numbers of the primary and alternate drug custodians. The registration request must
also include a complete unit address, telephone number, fax number, and e-mail address if
available.
   6.2.1. SF units in the US, including Hawaii, Alaska, Guam and Puerto Rico must also
   register with the DEA prior to requesting drug training aids. (In this chapter, all SF units in
   these locations are referred to as ―US-based units‖.) Registration can be done via the DEA
   website at www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov. (Upon request, DEA will send a protocol letter to
   the primary custodian with detailed instructions on how to register.) The custodian will then
   forward the protocol letter and DEA form 225, New Application for Registration to the DEA
   to obtain DEA Form 223, Controlled Substances Registration Certificate. Upon receiving
   DEA Form 223 from DEA, send a copy to AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX. A current DEA Form
   223 must be kept on file at AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX.
   6.2.2. All units may routinely order marijuana, cocaine and heroin. Units with a documented
   need for methamphetamine, hashish and ecstasy will submit a separate request through the
 20                                          AFI31-202_AFMCSUP_I 16 DECEMBER 2010


   MWD Program Manager justifying a need for the substance. The MAJCOM MWD Action
   Officer will indorse the request and forward it to AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX for processing.
   US-based units will also need to register with DEA for these substances.
       6.2.2.1. (Added-AFMC) Requests will be routed through HQ AFMC/A7SOT for
       endorsement. MDMA (Ecstasy) has become a standard training aid for all drug kits and
       no longer requires a separate request justifying the need.
   6.2.3. DEA controlled substance codes are as follows: marijuana (code 7360), hashish (code
   7360), cocaine (code 9041), MDMA [Ecstasy] (7405), heroin (code 9200) and
   methamphetamine (code 1105). US-based units use only these codes in correspondence with
   DEA.
6.3. Procurement of Drug Training Aids. The Armed Forces Institute of Pathology is the sole
provider of drug training aids to the DOD MWD Program, and has sole responsibility for issue
and final disposition of drug training aids.
   6.3.1. For US-based units, after registering with DEA, the primary drug custodian orders
   training aids by forwarding DEA Form 222, Controlled Substance Order Form, and letter of
   request for drug training aids to AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX. These DEA forms are controlled
   items, and may be obtained from the DEA website (www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov) or from
   DEA Headquarters, 700 Army Navy Drive, Arlington VA 22202-0002, 1-800-882-9539.
   Contact AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX for guidance on the letter of request
   6.3.2. Overseas SF units order drug training aids by sending a letter of request to
   AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX, with approval of the MAJCOM MWD Action Officer.
   6.3.3. Address correspondence to:
         Armed Forces Institute of Pathology
         Attn: Division of Forensic Toxicology/MWD Program
         Building 54, 6825 16th Street, NW

       6.3.7.3. Weigh each container to verify the weight listed on the receipt form.
       6.3.7.4. Record all data on AF Form 1205, Narcotic Training Aids Accountability
       Record. Do not repackage a training aid from its original container or break seals.
       6.3.7.5. US-based units annotate DEA Form 222 (copy 3) with the date received and
       number of containers of each substance.
       6.3.7.6. Sign and return one completed copy of the Construction/Receipt of Training
       Aids form to AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX.
       6.3.7.7. Keep a Controlled Substance Training Aid Accountability Folder for each
       separate narcotic substance received. Each folder will contain copies of DEA Form 222,
       Controlled Substance Order Form (US-based units only), AF Form 1205, Narcotics
       Training Aid Accountability Record, AFIP Construction/Receipt of Training Aids form,
       and a copy of AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX Training Aid Recall Letter when training aids
       have been recalled for replacement.
6.4. Analysis of Drug Training Aids. Only AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX will conduct an analysis
of training aids. If a training aid becomes damaged, leaks or becomes suspect due to repeated
failure by dogs to respond during training, separate the aid(s) from others. Report the damaged
or suspect training aid to the CSF. If deemed necessary, the CSF will initiate an investigation.
Send a message or letter to AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX with a copy to the MAJCOM MWD Action
Officer. The message will include the type, weight, and serial number of the training aid.
Include circumstances surrounding the situation as well as both a commercial and DSN phone
number for the primary custodian. Do not return the training aid to AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX
until directed to do so. Follow the procedures in Para 6.6 when returning training aids to
AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX.
   6.4.1. (Added-AFMC) Message copies will be sent to HQ AFMC/A7SOT.
6.5. Revalidation of Training Aids (Recall). AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX will begin revalidation
of drug training aids through a Training Aid Recall Letter. This revalidation will be done at least
every two years. Training aids used by the 341 TRS will be recalled every six months.
AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX will generally only recall half of a unit’s training aids at one time, thus
leaving some training aids on hand for continued training.
6.6. Returning Drug Training Aids to AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX. Local destruction of
training aids received from AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX is not authorized. Units will return drug
training aids to AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX for a variety of reasons, including the circumstances in
Paras 6.4 and 6.5. After receiving authority/request from AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX to return an
aid, units will do the following:
   6.6.1. DEA-registered units must complete and send DEA Form 222 (copies 1 & 2), plus the
   AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX Training Aid Examination Disposition Request, to
   AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX. File copy one of DEA form 222 in training aid accountability
   folder and forward copy two to the DEA Diversions Office – if applicable. Overseas units
   need not fill out the DEA form 222.
   6.6.2. Log out the training aid(s) in the daily issue/turn-in book and note that the aids were
   sent back to AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX.
   6.6.3. Return aid(s) to AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX via registered mail.

       6.6.4.3. File copy three in the proper accountability folder
       6.6.4.4. Overseas units will complete the Request for Replacement Training Aids Form
       and forward to AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX. Forms can be obtained on the DOD MWD
       Program Management Branch HQ AFSFC website at https://afsfmil.lackland.af.mil or
       directly from AFIP/AFMES via email at MWD@afip.osd.mil. (Overseas units do not
       use the DEA Fm 222.)
       6.6.4.5. AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX will send replacement aid(s) via registered mail.
       6.6.4.6. Upon receipt, log replacement aid(s) as if they were an initial shipment.
       6.6.4.7. Returned signed copy of AFIP CONSTRUCTION/RECEIPT OF DRUG
       TRAINING AIDS        form to AFIP.
   6.6.5. For final disposition of drug training aids, units registered with the DEA will send
   copy one of DEA Form 222 to AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX, copy two to the closest DEA
   Division Office and copy three will be filed in the Controlled Substance Training Aid
   Accountability Folders. (US-based units only)
6.7. Drug Training Aid Weight Checks. The primary or alternate drug custodian and a
disinterested person, E-5 or above or civil service equivalent (excluding contractors) appointed
by the CSF in writing, will weigh training aids monthly. Conduct the weight check using a
calibrated scale. The disinterested person may be assigned to the unit, but must be a different
person each month. Record the weights of the training aids in grams, in a bound (book type)
notebook. The disinterested person verifies the exact weight of each training aid and compares it
to the weight recorded on the AF Form 1205. The disinterested person also reviews the training
aid issue/turn-in log.
   6.7.1. The CSF directs an inquiry according to AFI 31-206, Security Forces Investigations
   Program, if there is evidence of tampering or an unexplained loss/gain of more than:
       6.7.1.1. 0.5 gram of methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine, MDMA or hashish training aids
       of all sizes.
       6.7.1.2. Two grams of marijuana from an individual training aid weighing 20 grams, one
       gram from aids weighing 10 grams, 0.5 grams from aids weighing five grams, and 0.2
       grams from aids weighing three grams.
       6.7.1.3. Send a copy of the final report (including actions taken) to the installation
       commander, MAJCOM MWD Action Officer and AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX. To get a
       replacement aid, follow the procedures above, and provide AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX a
       copy of the final report.
           6.7.1.3.1. (Added-AFMC) Copies         of   final   reports   will   be   sent   to   HQ
           AFMC/A7SOT.
       6.7.1.4. Maintain a copy of all investigations conducted and associated paperwork in the
       Controlled Substance Training Aid Accountability Folders.
AFI31-202_AFMCSUP_I 16 DECEMBER 2010                                                             23


6.8. Drug Training Aid Inventories and Audits. As a minimum, conduct a drug training aid
no-notice inventory annually or when custodians change. The installation commander or
designee appoints a disinterested person (master sergeant or above or civil service equivalent) to
inventory all drug training aids and to conduct an audit of the Controlled Substance Training Aid
Accountability Folders. The appointee cannot be any person who has conducted the audit in
previous years. Forward the results of the inventory/audit to the installation commander
(through the installation CSF) or designee for review. The primary custodian will maintain the
results of each audit/inventory for 1 year after training aids have been recalled by
AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX and are no longer accountable by the unit.
   6.8.1. (Added-AFMC) Extreme care must be used when handling drug training aids to
   prevent cross-substance or foreign matter contamination. Glue, masking tape, scotch tape,
   labels, or any other foreign matter must not be placed on, in, or near the drug training aids.
   6.8.2. (Added-AFMC) Each substance must be stored in a separate container. Ammunition
   cans are ideal for this containment. When using ammunition cans, clean them with mild soap
   and warm water, followed by rinsing with alcohol. Allow the cans to air dry. Do not paint or
   mark the inside of the container with materials that would cause odor contamination. A
   paper tag may be affixed to the container, designating it as marijuana, hashish, cocaine,
   heroin, or methamphetamine. Remove ammunition markings on ammunition containers
   prior to use when used for a purpose other than ammunition storage/transport.
6.9. Control of Drug Training Aids. The CSF identifies, in writing, personnel authorized to
sign out, possess, and use drug training aids. The custodian keeps a log of all training aids issued
and returned using a hard bound book with numbered pages or a book with pre-numbered pages.
If a new book is started, keep the old drug training aid log in the safe for no less than 2 years.
The log will include each drug training aid number; date; time; signature of issuing person;
signature of person receiving the training aid; signature of person returning the aid; and signature
of person verifying the return of the training aid. The person who receives the training aid is the
only one who can return it, unless a bonafide emergency directly involves the person who signed
the training aid out. The primary/alternate custodian will review the log weekly.
   6.9.1. The primary custodian will ensure training aids are returned the same duty tour they
   were signed out unless the CSF, operations officer, or other competent authority grants a
   special authorization in advance.
   6.9.2. The primary custodian will ensure personnel authorized to use drug training aids are
   trained on the protection requirements for controlled substances. Annotate the training in the
   individual’s OJT records. Positively control training aids at all times.
   6.9.3. Authorize, if necessary, MWD handlers to transport and use training aids when TDY.
   Record the authorization to possess drug training aids, including specific types, quantities,
   and training aid numbers on the handler's TDY orders.
   6.9.4. Send drug training aids to the TDY destination after the DOD handler arrives, or
   hand-carry as appropriate.
   6.9.5. If travelling to destination requires interrupted travel, coordinate in advance with the
   nearest military installation or civilian police agency to secure training aids. Use the AF
   Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt, as documentation.
 24                                            AFI31-202_AFMCSUP_I 16 DECEMBER 2010


   6.9.6. (Added-AFMC) Drug training aids must be visually checked for physical signs of
   tampering or leaks when checked in and out.
6.10. Change of Primary Custodian. When a US-based unit’s primary drug custodian is
departing, the unit will prepare a legal power of attorney for the purpose of enabling the alternate
custodian or other named person to order DEA forms and to send and receive drug training aids.
It is not necessary to immediately apply for a new DEA registration certificate. This can be done
by including the new custodian’s name when processing the next application to renew DEA
registration.
   6.10.1. File the certified power of attorney with the drug custodian appointment letter until
   the primary custodian returns, or a new custodian is appointed and the new DEA registration
   is received. Send copies of the power of attorney or new DEA registration to AFIP/AFMES/
   FORTOX.
   6.10.2. Overseas units send AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX Form, Transfer of MWD Team DEA
   Registrant, to AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX. Form may be obtained on the DOD MWD Program
   Management Branch HQ AFSFC website at https://afsfmil.lackland.af.mil or directly from
   AFIP/AFMES via email at MWD@afip.osd.mil.
6.11. Training with Additional Substances. Training with odors or substances other than
those listed in paragraph 6.2.2 must be approved by the Air Force MWD Program Office. The
request package must be coordinated through the MAJCOM MWD Action Officer and include
documentation supporting the need for the additional substance (OSI Threat Analysis, etc). If
approved, all requirements of this chapter must be adhered to procure the new substance from
AFIP/AFMES/FORTOX.
   6.11.1. (Added-AFMC) Requests will be routed through HQ AFMC/A7SOT for
   endorsement.

   SEARCH AND CALL BY, BUILDING SEARCH, SCOUTING AND PATROLING,
   VEHICLE PATROL AND SMALL ARMS FIRE. The operational effectiveness of teams
   failing critical tasks will be degraded. MWDs not meeting minimum standards on three
   consecutive training days without reason must enter extensive remedial training. If remedial
   training is unsuccessful, take the action outlined in paragraph 7.3.
   7.1.2. Semi-critical tasks are SIT, DOWN, HEEL, and ESCORT. The operational
   effectiveness of teams failing semi-critical tasks will not be seriously degraded. These teams
   must, however, receive corrective action to eliminate or reduce the deficiency.
   7.1.3. The OBSTACLE COURSE is the only non-critical task. Failure to meet non-critical
   task standards may affect the team’s efficiency, but will not degrade their overall
   performance.
   7.1.4. Conduct patrol dog task evaluations at least annually. Refer to the AFMAN 31-219
   for guidance on initial and follow-on performance standards. If evaluation results in failure
   of any critical task, the team will be entered immediately into extensive remedial training. If
   the MWD has performed unsatisfactorily in the ―stand-off‖ or ―out‖ command, a ―no release‖
   order will be issued by unit Operations Officer or higher to the handler and posted in the
   MWD’s permanent records until MWD has been properly trained and reevaluated
   satisfactorily. MWD may remain operational during the remedial training when order has
   been issued. If reasonable training efforts are unsuccessful, follow guidance in paragraph
   7.3.
   7.1.5. (Added-AFMC) The use of electronic training collars (shock collars) is prohibited.
   This equipment, in any form, will not be used on any military working dog for any reason.
7.2. Validation Testing and Certification Testing. MWD teams are measured against
minimum search standards. Validation and certification testing will be conducted on all MWD
teams when applicable.
   7.2.1. Validation testing is a tool to evaluate detector dog team proficiency. Do not use
   validation tests as additional training exercises. Dog teams must be validated prior to
   operational use, deployment or TDY in support of USSS or DOS. Validation testing will be
   done annually or whenever a new dog team is established. Refer to AFMAN 31-219 for
   guidance on conducting validation trials.
   7.2.2. Certification testing is used only as basis for establishing probable cause for issuance
   of a search warrant at home station. MWD teams must be validated by the kennel master
   prior to certification. MWD teams do not have to be certified to deploy or go TDY in
   support of USSS or DOS. Refer to AFMAN 31-219 for guidance on conducting
   certification.

7.3. Formal Decertification Process. If a dog fails to maintain detection standards or is unable
to perform any of the critical patrol dog tasks satisfactorily, the kennel master conducts
additional training to correct deficiencies and documents the actions taken.
   7.3.1. The kennel master begins formal decertification to change the dog’s National Stock
   Number to show its actual capability when:
       7.3.1.1. Long-term or unacceptable medical problems prevent the dog from performing
       critical patrol dog tasks. If the dog is a patrol/detector, use the dog as long as the medical
       problem does not interfere with the detection role.
       7.3.1.2. If little progress is made within 30 days, or the kennel master determines the
       problems are not correctable.
       7.3.1.3. Upon receiving a newly assigned dog from the 341 TRS which cannot perform
       one or more critical tasks within 120 days of assignment. Contact a 341 TRS MWD
       evaluator before starting a decertification package.
   7.3.2. If decertification is necessary, the kennel master will prepare a decertification
   package. Refer to AFI 23-224(I) for final disposition guidance. The CSF will indorse the
   package and send it to the respective MAJCOM MWD Action Officer and the 341 TRS. The
   package will include:
   7.3.2. (AFMC) If decertification is necessary, the kennel master will prepare a
   decertification package. Refer to AFI 23-224(I) for final disposition guidance. The CSF will
   indorse the package and send it to the respective MAJCOM MWD Action Officer and the
   341 TRS. Packages will be routed through HQ AFMC/A7SOT. The package will include:
       7.3.2.1. The apparent cause of the problem.
       7.3.2.2. A statement from the veterinarian if the dog's physical condition is the cause of
       the problem.
       7.3.2.3. A summary of retraining efforts.
       7.3.2.4. Copies of AF Forms 321 and 323 and DD Form 1834.
       7.3.2.5. The dog's minimum, maximum, current, and estimated weight range (from
       medical records)
       7.3.2.6. Past and current reward schedules.
       7.3.2.7. Other information relating to the problem. Include the dog's response and
       percentage of efficiency on each trained odor for detector dogs.
   7.3.3. The MAJCOM MWD Action Officer ensures the decertification package is properly
   justified and every effort has been made to correct the problem locally. Exceptions may be
   made for a dog's failure to upgrade during follow-on training based on all available facts. In
   these cases, the package is annotated and returned to the unit. If an exception is not granted,
   the package is forwarded to the 341 TRS for review.
   7.3.4. The 341 TRS helps field units correct training problems and recommends additional
   training as necessary. The 341 TRS reviews decertification actions to determine if the dog
   should be returned to the 341 TRS for evaluation. If the dog is returned, the 341 TRS may
   recommend de-certification, further training, or assign the dog to serve as a training aid at the
AFI31-202_AFMCSUP_I 16 DECEMBER 2010                                                       27


  school. If additional training corrects the problem, the dog will be recertified and with HQ
  Air Force MWD Program Management Office approval, returned to the original unit, or
  reassigned to another unit. DD Form 1834 will be annotated to reflect the reason for removal
  or decertification and the NSN is changed.

                                            Chapter 8

                                    MWD EMPLOYMENT

8.1. Law Enforcement. Patrol-certified MWDs seek, detect, bite and hold, and guard suspects
on command during patrol. They deter attack of and defend their handlers during threatening
situations. They can assist in crowd control and confrontation management, and search for
suspects and lost personnel, both indoors and outdoors.
8.2. Drug Suppression. Drug Detector Dog MWD teams are specially trained in drug detection
and support the Air Force goal of a drug-free environment. Their renowned capability to detect
illegal drugs deters drug use and possession, and is a valuable adjunct to a commander's other
tools such as urinalysis and investigation.
8.3. Explosive Detection. Explosive Detector Dog MWD teams are exceptionally valuable in
antiterrorism operations. They can detect unexploded ordnance, search areas during bomb
threats, and augment the EOD capability. Explosives detector dog teams are appropriate for
searching buildings, vehicles, baggage, packages, aircraft, etc. during threats, protection details,
or other routine or general sweeps. EDDs are not to be used to search suspicious unattended
packages or assess, examine, or clear items already identified as a suspected explosive item or
possible improvised device (IED). EDDs should not be used to validate the response of another
EDD or mechanical devices used to detect explosives. Searching refers to conducting a
systematic examination of an area, vehicle or other non-suspect items with EDD teams.
8.4. Contingency Operations. In war fighting roles, MWD teams provide enhanced patrol and
detection ability to perimeter and point defense. In bare base operations, deploy MWDs as an
early warning system. Given the range of potential contingencies, drug and explosives detection
are also valuable added capabilities in these environments since they are patrol dogs first and
detector dogs second. Likewise, EDDs have become indispensable in the deployed unit’s force
protection plan. MWD teams can be used in flash (sudden or instantaneous) aerial traffic control
point operations, dismounted combat patrols, show of force, and cordon and search operations.
Under no circumstances will MWDs be used in the interrogation or interview of Enemy
Prisoners of War (EPW) or detainees. Refer to AFMAN 31-219 for more guidance on
contingency operations.
8.5. Physical Security. The MWD team can augment in detection roles, temporarily replace
inoperative sensor systems, patrol difficult terrain, and deter would-be aggressors. For further
information on the use of MWD teams in physical security operations, refer to AFI 31-101.
8.6. Employment. Select posts with first consideration given to the dog’s keen sense of smell.
Dogs are most effective during nighttime hours and in areas of minimal activity. Rotate MWD
teams through all appropriate posts to meet operational needs and to maintain proficiency of the
MWD team. Refer to AFMAN 31-219 for further information on MWD employment.
8.7. Competition Outside DOD. MWD teams are encouraged to take part in public
demonstrations and competitions conducted by civil or military police agencies. Demonstrations
by explosive detector dogs are highly discouraged as it may generate prank bomb threats and
identify which dogs are EDDs. When competing in civilian competitions, handlers will not
allow their dogs to negotiate obstacles higher than those they have been trained on.
AFI31-202_AFMCSUP_I 16 DECEMBER 2010                                                            29


8.8. Searches. The person having command authority over all areas on the installation may
authorize detector dogs to search for drugs or explosives on the installation. The base staff judge
advocate (SJA) will provide guidance on conducting searches. Coordinate searches of postal
facilities with the base SJA. DO NOT use detector dogs to search a person.
   8.8.1. The official authorizing the search must be confident of the detector dog's ability to
   successfully detect the odor of drugs in the case of DDDs and explosives in the case of
   EDDs.
       8.8.1.1. To provide that assurance, maintain the following information for each detector
       dog in a probable cause folder:
       8.8.1.2. A general record of the training and experience of the team (AF Form 321).
       8.8.1.3. A detailed record showing the number of checks or searches, by date, locations,
       responses, and finds (AF Form 323).
       8.8.1.4. A record showing when the search authorizing authority reviewed these records.
       The search-granting authority or designee should review each folder annually and
       document the results by signature and date.
       8.8.1.5. Prepare a memorandum verifying the search-granting authority or delegated
       authority witnessed a detection demonstration. Include the date, the substance used, and
       results of the team's effort. The demonstration includes each substance the dog is trained
       to detect and one residual odor test (DDDs only). The residual odor test demonstrates
       that dogs are not trained to detect the presence of substance but rather the odor associated
       with a particular substance. Certification, as required by this paragraph, is valid only on
       the installation(s) under command authority of the demonstration-witnessing search
       granting authority. NOTE: The witnessing of this demonstration may be delegated to
       the CSF. Furthermore, when there are multiple installations in the vicinity or other
       geographically separated areas, the search granting authority or CSF delegate may
       prepare a memorandum to the installation search granting authority for the neighboring
       installations. If the search granting authority is confident in the dog’s ability to detect
       trained odors, he/she indorses the memorandum indicating concurrence and subsequent
       search authority.
       8.8.1.6. The kennel master will prepare a quarterly summary statement confirming the
       reliability of each detector team. Include the total time spent by the team in actual and
       training searches in each area shown on the AF Form 323, and for each type of drug or
       explosive used. The summary must agree with other facts in the file and include the
       validation test percentage of accuracy. This record also accompanies MWD teams when
       on TDY.
   8.8.2. In the CONUS, use dogs to inspect or search military aircraft, cargo, household goods,
   and baggage. At special foreign clearance bases where customs inspections are conducted,
   use dogs to search the luggage of DOD and DOD-sponsored personnel and the luggage of
   other passengers and crew carried aboard DOD aircraft.
   8.8.3. DOD teams are authorized to provide detection support to civilian law enforcement
   agencies (CLEA) as long as the support incurs no cost to the government and does not impact
30                                          AFI31-202_AFMCSUP_I 16 DECEMBER 2010


  on unit readiness. For further information on support to CLEAs and other non-DOD
  agencies, refer to Chapter 10.
  8.8.4. EDD teams primarily respond to explosive threats or serve as a deterrent through
  random searches. Use the following guidance when responding to bomb threats or situations
  where the presence of explosive devices is suspected.
     8.8.4.1. Evacuate the area depending on the threat received, local policy, and/or when
     ordered by base officials.
     8.8.4.2. Do not move or disturb anything unless it can positively be ruled out as an
     explosive device. Improvised explosive devices can be triggered many ways, including
     lifting, tilting, pushing, pulling, or by remote detonation devices.
     8.8.4.3. If lights or other electrical or mechanical appliances are on, leave them on. If
     lights are off, leave them off until the search is completed.
     8.8.4.4. Visually survey the entire area before starting a systematic search.
     8.8.4.5. Note areas where the dog shows significant interest but failed to give a response,
     so EOD can conduct follow-up searches.
     8.8.4.6. Do not touch or retrieve suspected objects or allow the dog to scratch, paw, or
     bite at the object.
     8.8.4.7. When the dog responds during an actual search, immediately mark the area and
     notify EOD personnel. Do not move, open, or tamper with any objects. Do not re-enter
     the area with the dog for the purpose of pinpointing or to further investigate the object.
     The use of a second dog to confirm or deny the response was legitimate should not be
     used as it will add unnecessary confusion and danger to the situation, especially if one
     MWD alerts and the other does not. EOD must be utilized to determine if the package or
     object is safe. If EOD personnel are not immediately available and you must neutralize a
     suspected explosive device (or limit the effects of a possible explosion), erect barricades
     of sandbags, mattresses, or other non-fragmenting material around the device.
     CAUTION: Do this only in cases of extreme necessity.

                                           Chapter 9

                      KENNEL FACILITIES AND CARE OF MWDS

9.1. Kennel Facilities . A suitable MWD Kennel Facility, support equipment, and explosives
storage facilities (if EDDs are assigned) must be available before MWDs may be shipped to an
installation. Kennel facilities require:
   9.1.1. Adequate ventilation, cooling, and heating. Kennel temperature should range from 45
   degrees Fahrenheit to 85 degrees Fahrenheit with humidity in the range of 40% to 70%.
   Note: MWDs work more effectively and are more alert when the kennel temperature is
   close to the temperature of their working environment. Strive to maintain a kennel
   temperature within 10 degrees of the exterior temperature.
   9.1.2. Minimal noise levels. Do not locate MWD Kennel Facility near runways, taxiways,
   engine test cells, small arms ranges, or other areas where the time-weighted overall average
   sound pressure level for any 24-hour period exceeds 75 adjusted decibels.
   9.1.3. Areas without infestations of mosquitoes, ticks, and rodents.
   9.1.4. Coordinate new construction planning documents and renovation actions with the
   supporting veterinarian, local base civil engineer and Antiterrorism/Force Protection office.
   9.1.5. Proper kennel maintenance requires frequent inspection and correction of
   discrepancies. Kennel masters, trainers, and handlers must maintain the MWD Kennel
   Facility according to AFMAN 31-219.
       9.1.5.1. (Added-AFMC) The kennel master must ensure:
          9.1.5.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Kennels are carefully inspected daily.
          9.1.5.1.2. (Added-AFMC) Immediately correct any item that has the potential to
          cause injury or disease.
          9.1.5.1.3. (Added-AFMC) Kennel runs are cleaned once per shift or whenever stool
          and urine is present. Drainage troughs will be washed down at least once during the
          handler’s shift.
          9.1.5.1.4. (Added-AFMC) Remove the dog from the kennel run prior to sanitizing
          the kennel run. Once the dog has been removed, sanitize the kennel run using hot
          water and detergent approved by the veterinarian or steam clean the run once per duty
          cycle with potable water. All areas must be thoroughly rinsed with potable water
          after cleansing with detergent. A chemical disinfectant approved by the veterinarian
          may be applied to control infectious bacteria and offensive odors.
   9.1.6. A secure training area is required for patrol and patrol/detector MWDs for advanced
   obedience and off-leash control training. The area should be close to the MWD Kennel
   Facility and meet the standards outlined in AFMAN 31-219
   9.1.7. Post all sides of the kennel and training areas with warning signs. Use the AFVA 125-
   21, Warning Military Working Dog Area Do Not Enter, or locally produced signs. In foreign
   countries, also translate signs into the host country language.
 32                                           AFI31-202_AFMCSUP_I 16 DECEMBER 2010


   9.1.8. Do not allow pets, stray animals, or unit mascots into the MWD facility or training
   area. Do not locate stray animal facilities with, or operate as part of, the MWD facility.
9.2. Care of MWDs. Arrange duty schedules of handlers and support personnel so the MWD
Kennel Facilities are continuously staffed, or such that at least one qualified handler is
immediately available. If a qualified handler is unavailable, the kennel master will train other
personnel to assist with non-duty hours facility checks and kennel support.
   9.2.1. If units have less than five MWDs or do not earn kennel support personnel, do the
   following when the MWD Kennel Facility is unattended:
       9.2.1.1. Keep a qualified MWD handler or trained kennel attendant on call. Use on-duty
       handlers for this purpose.
           9.2.1.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Provide procedures for obtaining non-duty hour medical
           care in the kennel support instruction. For unmanned kennel facilities, ensure written
           procedures are available to the Base Defense Operations Center (BDOC) Controller
           or the on-call handler.
       9.2.1.2. Lock the kennel facility. Keep the keys at a specific location, such as the law
       enforcement desk, for emergency purposes. Secure kennel runs to prevent opening of the
       kennel run gate by the MWD.
       9.2.1.3. Check the kennel facility and each MWD at a minimum of every 4 hours, or
       more frequently according to local procedures.
       9.2.1.4. Provide fresh water at each shift change.
   9.2.2. The US Army provides veterinary service for MWDs as prescribed by support
   agreements and AFJI 48-131/AR 40-905, Veterinary Health Services. Refer to AFJI 48-
   131/AR 40-905 for veterinary support and emergency veterinary care details. AFMAN 31-
   219 has additional information. The veterinarian and kennel master will establish sanitation
   standards and train handlers on first aid. Units must plan for veterinary care when supporting
   TDY commitments.
   9.2.3. Medical records kept by the veterinarian are permanent records. If the veterinarian
   does not have an office, the kennel master may store the records. Copies of all
   correspondence related to euthanasia are kept as part of the medical records. All medical
   records on deceased MWDs are sent to the 341 TRS. Veterinarians will also complete DD
   Form 1743, Death Certificate of Military Dog. The original is sent to the unit supply officer
   as the source document for removing the MWD from the unit property record. The first copy
   is filed in the MWD administrative record. A copy is also filed in the MWD medical records
   and sent to the MAJCOM MWD Action Officer if a replacement MWD is requested.
       9.2.3.1. (Added-AFMC) Upon death or euthanasia of a MWD, send copies of DD Form
       1743, Military Dog Death Certificate, and original DD Form 1834, Military Working
       Dog Service Record, to Status Control (341TRS/TTLM), 1239 Knight St, Lackland AFB,
       TX 78236-5631. Forward an information copy of the DD Form 1743 and DD Form 1834
       to HQ AFMC/A7SOT, MWD Program Manager.
   9.2.4. Handlers will be familiar with the dog's normal body functions, such as appetite,
   stools, and normal attitude, and report changes to the veterinarian immediately.
AFI31-202_AFMCSUP_I 16 DECEMBER 2010                                                          33


  9.2.5. The US Army Veterinary Command prescribes the type and brand of ration fed to
  MWDs. Procure food through official supply or GSA channels only unless the attending
  veterinarian approves a different ration.
  9.2.5. (AFMC) The US Army Veterinary Command prescribes the type and brand of ration
  fed to MWDs. Procure food through official supply or GSA channels only unless the
  attending veterinarian approves a different ration. The veterinarian will prescribe the time of
  day each dog is to be fed. This depends on the dog’s duty schedule and the schedule of other
  kennel activities. After the prescribed feeding period, leftover food must be disposed of
  within 2 hours and feeding pans must be cleaned and put away.

                                          Chapter 10

      DETECTOR DOG SUPPORT TO CIVILIAN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES

10.1. General: Executive Orders and public law permit, and in some cases may mandate, the
Department of Defense to provide explosive and narcotic detector dog support to civilian law
enforcement agencies for dignitary protection and drug interdiction. As the DOD Executive
Agency for military working dog program management, Headquarters Air Force Security Forces
Center, through delegated authority from HQ AF/A7S, receives and processes requests for
detector dog support from the United States Secret Service, Department of State, United States
Marshal Service (USMS), United States Customs Service (USCS), Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA), Federal Bureau of Investigation and other non-DOD law enforcement
agencies (LEA). This chapter provides guidance on deployment of detector dog teams in support
of these requests. Unless otherwise noted, references in this chapter apply to both Explosive
Detector Dogs (EDD) and Drug Detector Dogs (DDD).
10.2. Detector Dog Operations: Per title 10 U.S.C. § 372, Use of military equipment and
facilities, the Secretary of Defense may make equipment available to any federal, state, or local
LEA for law enforcement purposes. Upon request, an MWD (viewed by DOD as a piece of
equipment) may be loaned to law enforcement officials. If a MWD is loaned to a LEA, its
military handler must be provided to work the MWD as they always work as a team. Depending
upon the type of support, LEAs may submit a request for EDD/DDD support in several ways.
   10.2.1. Direct Routine Requests: For short-term support (less than 30 days), a LEA may
   submit a request directly to the Installation Commander. The Installation Commander may
   approve requests that do not require funding, or for which the LEA will provide
   reimbursement, if the support does not negatively affect the installation’s operational
   requirements for military readiness. If the LEA requests DOD funding, or if the installation
   does not have the capability to provide the requested support, the request will be forwarded
   through that MAJCOM’s MWD Action Officer to HQ AFSFC for resolution. Before
   providing non-emergency detector dog support to local government police, fires, or disaster
   officials, accomplish a Civilian Support Release and Reimbursement Agreement. Coordinate
   the agreement and requests for assistance with the local SJA. See Attachment 2 for a
   sample MWD Civilian Support Release and Reimbursement Agreement.
        10.2.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Requests requiring resolution above the installation level will
        be sent to HQ AFMC/A7SOT.
   10.2.2. Non-direct Routine Requests: EDD teams extensively support the USSS protection
   of the President, Vice President, First Lady and foreign heads-of-state. EDD teams also
   routinely support the DOS protection of the Secretary of State and foreign dignitaries. DDD
   teams support the USCS and DEA in the detection and monitoring of the air, land, and sea
   transit of illegal drugs. HQ AFSFC receives requests for support, validates these requests
   and sources support from the military installation nearest the support area with detector dog
   capability, regardless of Service component. All initial sourcing is done through the Service
   component or MAJCOM MWD Action Officer. Units that would suffer degradation of
   mission readiness through temporary loss of a detector dog will be excused from providing
AFI31-202_AFMCSUP_I 16 DECEMBER 2010                                                           35


  support and another unit will be tasked. Fiscal issues are generally not grounds to excuse a
  unit from providing support.
  10.2.3. Non-routine Requests: Requests for EDD support which do not meet the criteria as
  Non Direct Routine support (for example, National Special Security Events) are submitted to
  the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Executive Secretariat (OSD/ES). The requesting
  agency will submit a letter to OSD/ES explaining the reason for support and how they will
  reimburse the tasked unit. Once approved, OSD/ES notifies HQ AFSFC who will in-turn
  contact the responsible Service component or MAJCOM MWD Action Officer for the DOD
  unit closest to the mission support location. Team rotations for extended support will be
  done on a ―fair-share‖ basis.
  10.2.4. When detector dog teams support non-DOD agencies, the following procedures must
  be followed:
     10.2.4.1. The dog and handler must be used together.
     10.2.4.2. The handler must have exclusive control over the detection support effort and
     complete access to the search area. (EDD only).
     10.2.4.3. Handlers perform the sole task of working their dogs and will not take part in
     any other activity intended to support civil authorities unless specifically authorized by
     HQ AFSFC.
     10.2.4.4. Only the team's drug or explosives detection capabilities will be used. Teams
     will not track suspects, seize evidence, search buildings or areas for personnel, or be used
     to pursue, bite and hold, or in any way assist in apprehending, arresting or detaining
     persons.
     10.2.4.5. Teams will not be used to search persons.
     10.2.4.6. A representative of the requesting agency or civil jurisdiction must escort the
     team at all times while working.
     10.2.4.7. If the dog responds positively, the handler will advise the agency representative
     and withdraw or continue other disassociated detection support.
     10.2.4.8. An EDD handler will not disarm or move any actual or suspected explosive
     device.
     10.2.4.9. Advise the requesting agency that the DOD will not accept responsibility for
     damages resulting from the use of detector dog teams. Handlers will not seize or retrieve
     evidence, assist in setting up, or maintaining chain of custody, nor engage in any other
     activities which could be considered as enforcing the law in connection with this support.
     10.2.4.10. The handler may, if necessary, testify in civil court. Testimony will be limited
     to explaining the training received, the past success rates of the dog, the events leading to
     employment in this particular detection support, and the results of that detection support.
     10.2.4.11. MWD teams may assist CLEA in searching for persons when it is considered
     humanitarian in nature, for example, a lost child or elderly person.
  10.2.5. On all detector dog requests, once HQ AFSFC determines a tasked unit has sufficient
  resources to provide support, a tasking message is prepared and transmitted to the responsible
36                                          AFI31-202_AFMCSUP_I 16 DECEMBER 2010


  unit. The message will contain all information required to prepare TDYorders and brief
  handler(s) on requirements and responsibilities. The Commander and/or kennel master will
  ensure the handler(s) are thoroughly briefed on the message and provided a personal copy.
  Whenever possible, begin pre-departure preparations such as orders, canine physical and
  health certificate etc. immediately upon notification of a tasking. Do not wait for receipt of
  the tasking message as this could create logistics problems since most requests for support
  have a very short response time.
  10.2.6. Immediately upon notification of an MWD support request, the kennel master will
  select a qualified team. The kennel master will immediately notify the selected handler and
  provide the name and phone number of the requesting agency representative to contact. The
  handler will make immediate contact with the representative. If direct contact cannot be
  made, give a commercial 24 hour contact number so the representative can return the
  handler’s call. For USSS support, if voice contact is not made with the representative within
  four hours, the handler will contact the USSS Duty Desk, Washington D.C., (202) 395-4004
  and pass their name, travel information and 24 hour contact number.
  10.2.7. The tasked unit will also ensure the following is done as quickly as possible:
     10.2.7.1. Prepare TDY travel orders as determined by HQ AFSFC. Use of blanket or
     similar type TDY orders is not authorized when traveling in support of the President or
     Vice President of the United States. EDD handlers may be diverted or assigned another
     mission immediately after completing the initial mission. Ensure orders reflect
     ―Variations Authorized‖.
     10.2.7.2. If travel requires crossing any state line or country boundary, arrange for
     immediate veterinary physical and health certificate for the MWD tasked to support the
     mission. The MWD’s health records and current health certificate will accompany the
     handler while away from home station.
     10.2.7.3. Make travel arrangements for the handler and dog. Team will drive to the
     support area if within driving distance. The MAJCOM providing support will coordinate
     with HQ AFSFC as to whether the team should drive or fly.
     10.2.7.4. Contact the requesting agency representative and pass all information
     concerning travel arrangements and arrival time. (Do not use the large metal mobility
     type crate for these type deployments). See Para 2.7 for more guidance on shipping
     MWDs.
     10.2.7.5. A minivan or midsize sport utility vehicle are the standard for use by EDD and
     DDD teams. Use a government vehicle only with the approval of the requesting agency
     representative.
     10.2.7.6. Ensure handlers take sufficient dog food, as well as an extra leash, choke chain,
     and reward food and medication (as applicable), for the duration of the TDY. All teams
     will ensure they have a muzzle available at all times throughout the mission.
     10.2.7.7. (Added-AFMC) For units who do not have 24-hour Army Veterinarian
     Support, they must arrange procedures to obtain a Health Certificate for each deployable
     EDD, valid for the periods between the veterinarian’s base visits. If the veterinarian’s
AFI31-202_AFMCSUP_I 16 DECEMBER 2010                                                          37


     visits exceed the 10-day limit, arrange procedures through the base veterinarian services
     to obtain Health Certificates from a civilian veterinarian facility.
  10.2.8. Once at the mission location, detector dog teams will fall under the operational
  control of the supported agency but still responsible for direction issued by HQ AFSFC.
  10.2.8. (AFMC) Once at the mission location, detector dog teams will fall under the
  operational control of the supported agency but still responsible for direction issued by HQ
  AFSFC. Notify the home station kennel master upon arrival at the TDY location, and
  provide emergency contact information.
     10.2.8.1. The senior MWD handler will act as the military supervisor and assist the
     supported agency supervisor(s) as needed. During the security operation briefing (EDD)
     or mission orientation briefing (DDD), appropriate agencies will distribute identification
     media and equipment. Handlers will ensure OPSEC and security of the equipment at all
     times. Any identification designed at home station for the sole purpose of identifying the
     team as a DOD MWD team will not be used when supporting these missions. Orders
     will reflect the handler is traveling with a federal service animal and official credentials
     will be issued upon arrival at TDY location.
     10.2.8.2. Ensure the presence of a support agency representative or EOD technician at all
     times when the DDD or EDD team is searching. If an EDD responds, the handler will
     terminate the search and stand-by outside the affected area. Handlers will not handle or
     maintain custody of any explosive devices or drugs discovered.
     10.2.8.3. The EDD teams will only search for explosive devices and will not perform
     duties that may conflict with requirements established under the Posse Comitatus Act.
     DDD teams can only search for drug contraband.
  10.2.9. Male EDD handlers will wear conservative dark colored business suits. Female
  EDD handlers will wear conservative business suits with slacks in lieu of skirts. Certain
  missions require casual clothing or coveralls. Casual clothing is defined as dress
  slacks/khakis and long/short sleeve collared shirts. At no time will handlers wear jeans,
  shorts, tennis shoes, shirts with offensive language or logos while performing official duties.
  Military dress and appearance standards will be maintained throughout the duration of the
  TDY. The tasking message will identify clothing requirements. EDD handlers are
  authorized a civilian clothing allowance. Refer to DOD 7000.14R, Vol 7A, Military Pay
  Policy and Procedures Active Duty and Reserve Duty on the publications website.
  10.2.10. Handlers currently assigned and validated with an MWD will have an Official
  Passport and a current Defense Travel System account. Taskings to support OCONUS
  missions are common and rarely have sufficient advance notice to process a passport
  application. Complete and process an official passport application for handlers immediately
  upon their assignment to the unit. Contact local MPF for guidance.
     10.2.10.1. (Added-AFMC) All personnel assigned to the MWD program will have
     official passports. These passports are needed to support EDD/DDD duties and
     contingency actions (mobility positions such as the QFEBR and QFEBP).
  10.2.11. Weapons of any type, including privately owned, are prohibited while performing
  duties with any non-DOD agency unless directed otherwise by HQ AFSFC.
38                                         AFI31-202_AFMCSUP_I 16 DECEMBER 2010


  10.2.12. The use of Government Sponsored Travel Credit Card (GTCC) is mandatory IAW
  DOD Financial Management Regulation (FMR) Vol 9, 030301. Each handler must possess a
  government Sponsored Travel Card, unless exempted as prescribed by DOD FMR Vol 9,
  030302. The DTS system does allow for electronic fund transfer advances to be made to
  travelers who do not possess GTCC’s, but is not always practical due to time restraints.
  10.2.13. If confusion or a disagreement on how to search an area occurs, the senior handler
  will meet with the supported agency representative and attempt to resolve the issue. If a
  resolution cannot be reached, the MWD team will proceed as directed, unless the safety of
  the team would be compromised. Accomplish a detailed after action report of the incident
  and forward it through the MAJCOM MWD Action Officer to HQ AFSFC as soon as
  possible. If a similar conflict arises with a DDD team, the senior handler/supervisor will
  attempt to reach a resolution with the supported agency. If no resolution can be reached,
  contact HQ AFSFC and file an after action report and forward it to the HQ Air Force MWD
  Program Manager.
     10.2.13.1. (Added-AFMC) After action reports will be sent to HQ AFMC/A7SOT.
  10.2.14. Both EDD and DDD handlers will adhere to all safety practices at all times.
     10.2.14.1. Do not leave MWDs unattended in vehicles, except in an emergency. If a rare
     situation arises when you must leave an MWD unattended in a vehicle, ensure the MWD
     remains in view at all times and that adequate ventilation is provided.
     10.2.14.2. MWDs will remain on leash at all times while searching and muzzled to and
     from search areas. Handlers will make every attempt to ensure areas they will search are
     cleared of non-essential personnel.
     10.2.14.3. If you must leave an MWD unattended in a hotel room, secure it in the travel
     crate and post the hotel ―Do Not Disturb‖ sign on the door exterior to deter anyone from
     entering the room. Report damage caused to a hotel room to the supported agency
     representative and the MAJCOM MWD Action Officer immediately.
         10.2.14.3.1. (Added-AFMC) If your hotel room has been damaged, notify HQ
         AFMC/A7SOT in writing within 24-hours or the next duty day.
  10.2.15. After-action reports are only required when significant events occur during the
  mission. Handlers can submit optional reports to recognize positive or negative aspects of
  the mission. When prepared, send a copy of after-action reports to HQ AFSFC/SFOC.
