This Air Force Instruction (AFI) establishes guidance for the United States Air Force (USAF)
Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT) Program. It implements Air Force
(AF) Policy Directive (AFPD) 44-1, Medical Operations. This instruction provides guidance for
the identification, treatment and management of personnel with substance use disorders (SUDs)
and describes AF policy regarding alcohol abuse, prescription drug misuse, and drug abuse. This
instruction applies to all active duty (AD) USAF members, and to members of the USAF
Reserve Command (AFRC) and Air National Guard (ANG) whenever eligible for DoD medical
services, with the exception of paragraph 3.2, which applies to all Reservists at all times. The

3.3. ADAPT Program Overview.
   3.3.1. The primary objectives of the ADAPT Program are to promote readiness, health, and
   wellness through the prevention and treatment of substance misuse and abuse, to minimize
   the negative consequences of substance misuse and abuse to the individual, family, and
   organization, to provide comprehensive education and treatment to individuals who
   experience problems attributed to substance misuse or abuse, to restore function and return
   identified substance abusers to unrestricted duty status or to assist them in their transition to
   civilian life, as appropriate. (T-1) These objectives are met through four levels of activities:
       3.3.1.1. Universal (Primary) Prevention and Education: This includes population-based
       outreach, education, prevention programs, screening, and consultation. Community-
       based prevention and education efforts will be delivered by ADAPT staff through
       coordinated efforts with other community agencies. (T-3) Clinic- based services,
       screening and consultation will be delivered through the ADAPT Program. (T-2)
       3.3.1.2. Selective (Targeted) Prevention: This involves global screenings for alcohol
       misuse, as well as initiatives to prevent future alcohol misuse, prescription drug misuse,
       or drug use with individuals who are identified as high risk or are suspected of substance
       misuse. Selective prevention includes screening, assessment, education, brief preventive
       counseling, and tailored feedback in specific individuals or groups identified as moderate
       to high risk.
       3.3.1.3. Indicated Prevention: This is indicated for those who are engaging in risky
       drinking but have not yet developed problems associated with their drinking. Individuals
       in this group can be identified through screening in primary care or other appropriate
       setting. The majority of these individuals are best served through motivational
 14                                                                       AFI44-121 8 JULY 2014


       interviewing and brief advice. This focuses on those who are already in the early stages
       of alcohol and substance use.
       3.3.1.4. Treatment and Continuing Care (Aftercare): Provide evidence-based substance
       use disorder treatment for individuals who are abusing or are dependent on alcohol or
       drugs that follows the clinical practice guidelines. (T-3) The primary aim should be
       restoring function, improving quality of life, and returning members to productive and
       unrestricted duty, or to assist them in their transition to civilian life, as appropriate. (T-3)
       All installations will provide Level 1.0 care, other higher level care can be provided by
       civilian or military facilities with a referral from the provider. (T-1)
   3.3.2. Use of evidence-based services.
       3.3.2.1. ADAPT Program will provide evidence-based substance use disorder services
       that adhere to this instruction, clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), as well as other
       DoD/Veterans Affairs (VA) sanctioned task force and/or accredited professional
       organizations specializing in the treatment of substance use disorders. (T-0)
   3.3.3. The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) Patient Placement Criteria
   (PPC) will be utilized by every installation ADAPT Program to match personnel to the
   appropriate level of care. (T-1) The ASAM PPC describes treatment on a continuum of five
   basic levels of care. Every installation will have the following: (T-1)
       3.3.3.1. Level 0.5: Alcohol Brief Counseling (ABC, Selective Prevention and
       Education). (T-1)
       3.3.3.2. Level 1.0: Outpatient Services. (T-1)
3.4. Scope and Limitations.
   3.4.1. ADAPT Program treatment information collected and maintained as a part of ADAPT
   treatment or aftercare services are maintained IAW 42 U.S.C. 290dd-2 and AFI 33-332. (T-

   Program (See Chapter 2). (T-1)
3.6. Substance Misuse Prevention Strategies.
   3.6.1. Substance misuse prevention efforts are geared toward enhancing individual and unit
   resiliency, both of which can be compromised by hazardous alcohol use and SUDs.
   Prevention strategies must be comprehensively structured to educate and inform the overall
   population as well as specifically target higher risk populations. (T-0)
      3.6.1.1. In collaboration with other Integrated Delivery System (IDS) members, the
      ADAPT staff works to develop and implement prevention programs geared towards
      increasing organizational and individual awareness of SUD issues, including misuse and
      abuse of prescription medications, illegal and illicit drug abuse, trends, and threat to
      mission readiness. (T-0)
   3.6.2. Substance abuse and misuse prevention and education programs will at a minimum
   meet the objectives listed in Table 3.1 of this AFI, DoD Directive (DoDD) 1010.4, Drug and
   Alcohol Abuse by DoD Personnel, DoDD 1010.6, Rehabilitation and Referral Services for
   Alcohol and Drug Abusers, DoDI 1010.04, Problematic Substance Use by DoD Personnel,

   screened at least annually for alcohol misuse in Primary Care. (T-0) All TRICARE
   beneficiaries are also screened for alcohol misuse during appointments in Primary Care. (T-
   0) Individuals are typically screened using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test
   (AUDIT) or AUDIT-C. If an individual screens positive for alcohol misuse, the Primary
   Care provider may provide a brief intervention, refer the individual to a behavioral health
   optimization program (BHOP) provider, or refer to the ADAPT Program for an evaluation
   for specialty treatment depending on what the screening results indicate from the VA/DoD
   CPGs. See Module A of VA/DoD CPG. (T-0)

       availability, promotion eligibility, reenlistment eligibility, PRP, security clearance, etc.
       (T-2) Application of administrative restrictions should be based on the establishment of a
       UIF or control roster resulting from the member’s unacceptable behavior and not solely
       based on their involvement in the ADAPT Program. (T-3)
       3.7.2.11. The CC, and/or first sergeant will actively participate on the TT by providing
       input to treatment decisions. (T-0) Command involvement is critical to a comprehensive
       treatment program, as well as during aftercare and follow-up services. The CC shall also
       provide command authority to implement the treatment plan when the member does not

   of collateral data as appropriate), determination of risk, and should be tailored for the
   individual. (T-0)
   3.9.2. Evaluation for specialty treatment requires a thorough biopsychosocial assessment that
   adheres to evidence based clinical practice guidelines from VA/DoD. (T-0) The initial
   assessment in ADAPT is the SUAT Intake/Assessment. (T-3) Information from the SUAT
   intake is utilized to make treatment recommendations. (T-3)
 20                                                                          AFI44-121 8 JULY 2014


       3.9.2.1. When treating ADAPT patients, providers and technicians must do a complete
       review of the individual’s medical history, including a thorough medication
       reconciliation. (T-1) This can help providers uncover potential poly-substance abuse
       disorders, identify drug-seeking behaviors, and target therapy appropriately. Throughout
       treatment, providers should periodically monitor any changes in the patient’s medical
       diagnoses or medication regimen in order to identify unrecognized prescription
       medication abuse. (T-1)
   3.9.3. Information gathered during the assessment will form the basis for patient diagnosis,
   treatment planning, and delivery of SUDs-related services. (T-0)
   3.9.4. Except in cases of self-identification, information the patient provides in response to
   assessment questions may be used in a court-martial and to characterize service at the time of
   discharge. Such evidence may be introduced for other administrative purposes or for
   impeachment or rebuttal purposes in any proceeding in which the patient introduced evidence
   of SUD (or lack thereof). Consult with appropriate medical legal consultant, if one is
   available, or other legal and/or investigative authorities regarding any questions. (T-3)

3.11. Level 0. 5: Requirements for Alcohol Brief Counseling (ABC; Selective Prevention
and Education).
   3.11.1. Overview. Selective prevention strategies focus on individuals who have been
   identified or are suspected of high risk use of substances but do not indicate a pattern of
   diagnosis substance abuse or dependence. The goal of clinical prevention and education
   activities should be reducing further alcohol misuse or other drug use by increasing
   awareness and understanding of consequences, as well as, developing a plan for positive
   change. All individuals referred to the ADAPT Program that do not receive a SUD diagnosis
   and have had an ARM, or self-identify for a substance abuse and misuse problem will receive
   ABC. (T-1) ABC is not mandated for individuals who receive Level 2.1 or higher. Civilians
   will be seen for an initial assessment, ABC, and other services IAW AFI 44-107 (90-508
   once 44-107 has been replaced). (T-1)
   3.11.2. For members who are not diagnosed with a SUD, the intensity of preventative
   counseling services should be based on evaluation of risk. (T-0)
   3.11.3. Early Intervention: ABC. Refer to the ADAPT ABC Counselor’s Training Manual
   for additional information. An electronic copy of the manual can be obtained from the
   ADAPT Branch staff at AFMOA/SGHW. The ABC process requires eliciting patient
   response to identified risks and concerns, as well as identifying possible areas for behavior
   change. (T-1)
      3.11.3.1. Session 1: Motivational-focused discussion on patient concerns. Patients
      assigned Alcohol Education and Value Exploration Modules (AEM and VEM). (T-3)
      For patients who misuse substances other than alcohol, the required AEM can be
      modified or replaced as appropriate.
      3.11.3.2. Session 2: Discuss patient concerns.      Follow-up on AEM and VEM, and
      develop change plan. (T-3)
          3.11.3.2.1. Alcohol Education Model (AEM). AEM also reinforces the AF and DoD
          policy that any use of illicit drugs is incompatible with AF and DoD standards and
          will automatically place an AF member’s career in jeopardy. Other modules, such as
          Values Clarification, Anxiety Management, Anger Management, Assertive
          Communication, Changing Self-Talk, Sleep Enhancement, Key Ingredients for
 22                                                                     AFI44-121 8 JULY 2014


          Relaxation, can be added based on the individual’s needs. AEM provides an overview
          of the AF and DoD policy, as well as civilian laws regarding to proper use of alcohol,
          and will be completed within two weeks (14 calendar days) of assessment. (T-3)
          3.11.3.2.2. Value Exploration Module (VEM). VEM provides an opportunity for the
          patient to share what he or she feels is important, and allows for identification of
          specific goals. The goals that are developed during VEM are essential for helping
          patients see the discrepancy between his or her current behavior and the patient’s
          goals.
      3.11.3.3. Session 3: Discuss patient concerns and follow-up on change plan. Following
      session three, the patient may be assigned additional modules and sessions, may be
      referred to treatment, or the patient’s case may be closed out and patient will be provided
      resources. (T-3)
3.12. Treatment Program Guidelines.
   3.12.1. Overview. After being diagnosed with a SUD, patients will be placed in the
   appropriate level of care IAW ASAM PPC. (T-0) To make the appropriate placement,
   ADAPT staff will utilize the ASAM Criteria Assessment Dimensions. (T-0)
   3.12.2. At every level of care, the treatment program will reflect a multi-disciplinary
   approach to assist the patient to achieve full recovery, free of the negative effects of the SUD.
   (T-0)
   3.12.3. It is important to note that command involvement is critical to a comprehensive SUD
   treatment program, prevention and early intervention stages, as well as during continuing
   care (aftercare). (T-0)
   3.12.4. The treatment plan must be developed IAW ASAM PPC. (T-0) ASAM PPC reflects
   the philosophy of placing patients in the least intensive/restrictive treatment environment,
   appropriate to their therapeutic needs. Variable lengths of stay/duration of treatment shall be
   provided within a variety of treatment settings. (T-0)
   3.12.5. When patients are diagnosed with a SUD and entered into the ADAPT Program, the
   ADAPT PM will enter the demographic data, annotate that the member is not qualified for
   World Wide Duty, check the Mobility Restriction box check code 31(for most ADAPT
   patients), and enter a release date on the AF Form 469 in ASIMS. (T-1) Only specific
   limitations will be entered. (T-1) Diagnoses will not be recorded on the comment or
   limitation section of this form. (T-1) After electronic signature, the form will be
   automatically forwarded to the Medical Standards Management Element (MSME), and to the
   Profile Officer. (T-1) The Profile Officer will validate by electronic signature, and the form
   will be automatically returned to MSME. (T-1) It is then forwarded electronically to the
   member’s unit commander for concurrence/non-concurrence. (T-1) The commander or
   designated representative will issue the profile to the member. (T-1) Complete profile IAW
   AFI 48-123 & AFI 10-203. (T-1)
   3.12.6. Individuals diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder will refrain from the use of
   alcohol during treatment. (T-0) During continuing care (aftercare), abstinence may be an
   important treatment goal. However, responsible drinking goals can also be considered for
   continuing care (aftercare). A return to drinking during treatment or continuing care
AFI44-121 8 JULY 2014                                                                        23


   (aftercare) is not uncommon and should not, in itself, be considered unsatisfactory progress
   or treatment failure. (T-0)
   3.12.7. Ensure that primary care manager (PCM) is notified of TT outcome if appropriate for
   continuity of care. (T-2)
   3.12.8. Commanders are responsible for the administrative determination about the service
   member and can concur or non-concur with the medical determination, and then take the
   action they deem appropriate. (T-3)
   3.12.9. Involvement in self-help recovery groups (e.g. 12-step, Rational Recovery, etc.) is
   encouraged as an adjunct to treatment. The frequency of attendance is determined by the TT
   with the patient. (T-3)
   3.12.10. Commander (or First Sergeant) and supervisor involvement in the TT at key points
   in the patient’s treatment and recovery is important.
   3.12.11. Determinations about a patient’s availability for PCS or TDYs will be coordinated
   through the TT during the patient’s course of treatment. (T-3) Generally, patients diagnosed
   with substance use disorders are restricted from worldwide duty for their first six months of
   treatment. (T-3)
   3.12.12. When patients PCS, (while in continuing care) the ADAPT staff will forward one
   copy of the AD patient’s outpatient MH record (if a hard copy record exists) to the gaining
   base’s outpatient MH clinic to ensure continuity of care is maintained. (T-2) See AFI 44-172
   for additional information.

       3.14.2.4. CADCs, MH technicians, or privileged MH providers involved in the case. (T-
       1)
       3.14.2.5. Medical providers as needed (e.g. primary care managers). If the patient is on
       flight status, a flight surgeon will be included in the TTM. Refer to AFI 48-123, Medical
       Examinations and Standards, for further guidance. (T-1)
       3.14.2.6. Other individuals as deemed necessary. (T-1)
       3.14.2.7. The patient, unless deemed clinically inappropriate. In this case, the patient
       will be briefed on the treatment decisions of the TT. (T-1)
   3.14.3. CC (or First Sergeant) and supervisor must be involved at program entry,
   termination, and any time there are significant treatment difficulties with the patient. (T-0)
   ADAPT staff must brief CCs (or first sergeant) on patient progress at least quarterly either –
   telephonically, individually, or within the TT. (T-0) Per DoD guidance, the CC must be
   involved in the patient’s treatment (and continuing care (aftercare)) program (T-0)
   3.14.4. TTMs must be mindful of protecting patient privacy to the greatest extent possible
   while still allowing for meaningful review. (T-0) Only information pertinent to treatment
   decisions should be shared with the TT. (T-0) The patient should be informed about the
   purpose of the TT and the nature of the information that will be shared. (T-0) ADAPT staff
   will brief the CC/First Sergeant/supervisor about privacy of patient’s information and
   document a verbal non-disclosure agreement. (T-0)
   3.14.5. Treatment Planning. The primary purpose of the treatment plan is to establish the
   frame work for the patient’s treatment and recovery. The treatment plan documents the level
   and intensity of care, incorporates issues, problem areas, life skill deficits, and goals
   identified during the biopsychosocial assessment, and identifies appropriate treatment
   resources to be utilized during the patient’s course of treatment. (T-0)
       3.14.5.1. The treatment plan will be comprehensive, individual-specific, and stated in
       behavioral terms. (T-0)
       3.14.5.2. Treatment plans will be reviewed at each individual session to ensure that the
       plan reflects status of the patient’s progress toward effective SUD recovery and
       stabilization of other identified clinical issues. (T-1)
       3.14.5.3. Patients will adhere to the treatment plan developed by the TT. (T-1)
3.15. Detoxification.
   3.15.1. Patients being referred for inpatient treatment will be assessed to determine the level
   of detoxification services required (e.g. Level 1-WM – Level 4-WM). (T-0) When medically
   indicated, patient detoxification will be managed on an outpatient basis prior to inpatient or
   residential treatment. (T-0)
AFI44-121 8 JULY 2014                                                                             25


   3.15.2. Patients assessed as requiring medically managed detoxification (inpatient) will be
   entered into an appropriate medical facility. (T-0)
   3.15.3. All patients utilizing aeromedical evacuation services must have 72 hours of
   monitored abstinence (inpatient or outpatient) prior to departure. (T-1)
3.16. Continuity of Care in Treatment.
   3.16.1. ADAPT Program staff will communicate with the non-AF Intensive Outpatient
   (IOP), Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP), residential, or inpatient treatment facility to
   ensure continuity of care before, during and after any treatment received and document
   interaction in the ADAPT patient record. (T-1)
   3.16.2. Local patients referred to a PHP, residential, or inpatient program may begin
   treatment immediately, if the history, physical examination, and other documentation
   indicate that the patient can safely begin treatment. If, however, the patient experiences
   symptoms of apparent withdrawal, he or she will be re-assessed and a detoxification protocol
   initiated. (T-0)
   3.16.3. Considerations following IOP, PHP, Residential or Inpatient Treatment Completion.
      3.16.3.1. Patients will be seen for a face-to-face visit the same day whenever possible,
      but NLT the next duty day after discharge from inpatient, residential, PHP or IOP
      treatment programs. This includes discharges from DoD or civilian facilities. (T-1) At a
      minimum, a relapse prevention plan will be created (or reviewed if created prior to
      discharge) and agreed upon. (T-1) Suicide risk will also be assessed at this visit and a
      follow-up visit will be scheduled. (T-1) Patients discharged from inpatient, residential or
      PHP will be placed on High Interest and monitored over a sufficient period of time and
      removed from High Interest IAW AFI 44-172. (T-1) If a face-to-face visit cannot be
      accomplished on the same day of discharge, the ADAPT Program staff must document
      the reason(s) why the evaluation did not occur (e.g. discharged on Saturday or holiday
      weekend, transferred to general medical unit afterwards, etc.). (T-1)
      3.16.3.2. Patients returning from an IOP, PHP, residential or inpatient treatment facility
      will have a TT meeting convened within 14 calendar days of return to assess the patient’s
      progress during inpatient or residential treatment and design a continuing care (aftercare)
      plan. (T-1) Decisions regarding continuing care (aftercare) services will be based on a
      current assessment of status and will include establishment of a continuing care treatment
      plan identifying specific goals, interventions, and means to assess interventions. (T-0)
      3.16.3.3. The ADAPT staff will request a summary from the treatment facility and
      include it in the record IAW 44-172 and advise the command of all relevant treatment
      outcomes. (T-1)
   3.16.4. Use of pharmacological treatments, such as Naltraxone, Disulfiram, Acamprosate,
   etc., will be strictly monitored by the psychiatrist or other physician who has prescribed the
   medication, and/or the physician assigned to monitor patients within the ADAPT Program.
   (T-1) The ADAPT Program staff will communicate with all providers to ensure continuity of
   treatment. (T-1)
   3.16.5. Long-Term Inpatient/Residential Substance Use Treatment. Whenever possible and
   appropriate, military inpatient or residential substance use treatment facilities will be used for
 26                                                                   AFI44-121 8 JULY 2014


   service members for long-term treatment. (T-0) National Defense Authorization Act for
   Fiscal Year 2010, Section 596 prohibited services from using contract facilities for long-term
   inpatient or residential substance use treatment of AD members for periods exceeding 30
   days. (T-0)
3.17. Continuing Care (Aftercare) Program.
   3.17.1. Upon completion of the treatment section of the ADAPT Program (e.g. Outpatient,
   IOP, PHP, etc.), the member will begin a period of continuing care (aftercare). (T-0) A TTM
   will convene to create a continuing care (aftercare) plan. (T-0) All patients who completed
   treatment will participate in continuing care (aftercare) as part of the ADAPT Program. (T-0)
   3.17.2. Movement of patients into continuing care (aftercare) is not determined simply by
   completing the outpatient, IOP, PHP, inpatient or residential treatment. Continuing care
   (aftercare) does not begin until all goals of the treatment plan are met. (T-1) Once these
   goals are met, the patient is moved into continuing care (aftercare). (T-1)
   3.17.3. Continuing Care (Aftercare) requirements.
      3.17.3.1. Patient’s progress will be monitored by the ADAPT staff at least every 30 days
      while the patient is in continuing care (aftercare). (T-0)
      3.17.3.2. The goal of continuing care is to ensure any new goals are addressed, the
      patient does not need to be returned to treatment, and a relapse prevention plan is
      implemented and proceeding smoothly. (T-1)
   3.17.4. CCs will ensure that AD personnel with a drug history undergo monthly random
   drug testing for one year following their most recent discharge from a treatment program.
   Those with special duty requirements may have additional drug monitoring standards
   imposed by professional boards or DoD policy. (T-0)
3.18. Program Completion and Program Failure.
   3.18.1. Program Completion. Patients will not be considered to have successfully completed
   the ADAPT Program until the patient has completed treatment and continuing care
   (aftercare). (T-0) The TT determines, based on VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines for
   Management of Substance Use Disorders, current DSM criteria and ASAM PPC, patient’s
   progress towards agreed upon goals and/or issues as stated in the treatment and continuing
   care (aftercare) plans, when the patient no longer requires program resources. (T-0)
      3.18.1.1. ANG members who are referred by the ADAPT PM to a non-military
      provider/agency for substance use disorder treatment will not be considered to have
      successfully completed the ADAPT Program until the member has completed treatment
      and continuing care (aftercare). (T-0) The TT determines, in coordination with GMU
      personnel, based on VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines for Management of Substance
      Use Disorders, current DSM criteria and ASAM PPC, patient’s progress towards agreed
      upon goals and/or issues as stated in the treatment and continuing care (aftercare) plans,
      when the patient no longer requires program resources. (T-0)
      3.18.1.2. ANG members who have not been entered into the ADAPT Program will be
      referred to the DPH for case management services. (T-1)
AFI44-121 8 JULY 2014                                                                           27


   3.18.2. Program Failure. The TT determines a patient to have failed the program based on a
   demonstrated pattern of unacceptable behavior, unwillingness to engage with the ADAPT
   Program after having an ARM, inability or unwillingness to comply with their treatment
   plan, or involvement in ARMs after receiving initial treatment. (T-0) The determination that
   a patient has failed treatment is based on the patient’s repeated failure to meet and maintain
   AF standards (behavior), rather than solely on the use of alcohol. (T-0) Individuals who have
   been determined as failing the ADAPT Program shall be considered for administrative
   separation by their CC. (T-0)
      3.18.2.1. If a patient is failed from the ADAPT Program and is awaiting discharge from
      the AF, the patient should be offered services until s/he is discharged. (T-1) If the patient
      refuses this continued support, the command should be notified so leadership can ensure
      safety of the individual. (T-1) This would provide the patient with transition services that
      are required. (T-0) These visits would be used to support patients in their transition to the
      civilian world and help ensure safety of the patient during a stressful time.
      3.18.2.2. A member that has previously failed the ADAPT Program and has a subsequent
      ARM is not mandated to enter the program again. Entering the program will be at the
      discretion of the TT, with the ultimate decision made by the Program Manager. (T-1) At
      a minimum, a safety assessment should be conducted and if needed, further services
      should be provided in regards to patient safety. (T-1)
      3.18.2.3. Individuals being processed for separation will be provided appropriate medical
      care prior to separation. (T-0) Separation action will not be postponed because of a
      members participation in the ADAPT Program. (T-0)
          3.18.2.3.1. ANG members who are eligible for military treatment services will be
          provided appropriate medical care prior to separation. (T-0) Separation action will
          not be postponed because of a member’s participation in the ADAPT Program. (T-0)
      3.18.2.4. For ANG, the TT will be convened telephonically with the ANG Behavioral
      Health Consultant to determine if a patient has failed the program based on a
      demonstrated pattern of unacceptable behavior, unwillingness to engage with the GMU
      or ADAPT Program after having an ARM, inability or unwillingness to comply with their
      treatment plan, or involvement in ARMs after receiving initial treatment. (T-1) The
      ADAPT PM will coordinate with non-military providers for ANG members who have
      been referred for treatment to determine program outcome. (T-1) ANG members who
      have been determined as failing the ADAPT Program shall be considered for
      administrative separation by their CC. (T-1)
3.19. Additional Treatment and Continuing Care (Aftercare) Considerations.
   3.19.1. Airmen who are in treatment and continuing care (aftercare) should be carefully
   assessed by the TT for mobility restrictions. (T-1) When appropriate, the PM, with input
   from the TT, should complete a mobility restricting profile during the period of treatment and
   continuing care (aftercare). (T-1) Any patient with a SUD diagnosis should be placed on a
   mobility restricting profile during treatment. (T-1) If a patient needs continuing care
   (aftercare), s/he should not be allowed to deploy. (T-1) If the TT determines, after a stable
   period of time in continuing care (aftercare), the patient could deploy with no follow-up
 28                                                                 AFI44-121 8 JULY 2014


   services, then the patient could be deployed. (T-1) The final recommendation on mobility
   status is made by the ADAPT PM. (T-1)
      3.19.1.1. Duty limitations (which can include restrictions for military occupation,
      mobility, and/or fitness) are entered on the AF Form 469 IAW AFI 10-203. (T-1) Any
      DLC which restricts mobility or may be unfitting for continued military service must
      undergo an Initial RILO at HQ AFPC Medical Retention Standards Branch (DPANM), or
      the appropriate ARC Chief of Aerospace Medicine (SGP), after 365 cumulative days of
      restrictions documented on an AF Form 469 related to that condition IAW AFIs 48-123
      and 41-210. (T-1) Airmen with an Assignment Availability Code (AAC) 31 (mobility
      restriction greater than 30 days) that exceeds, or is reasonably expected to exceed, 365
      days (cumulative for same or related condition) require review by the installation
      Deployment Availability Working Group (DAWG) with referral, if indicated, to DPANM
      or Air Reserve Component (ARC) SGP for Initial RILO, unless discussed with DPANM
      or ARC SGP. (T-1)
   3.19.1.2. Aeromedical Services Information Management System (ASIMS) will be used to
   monitor Clients’ Profiles in Treatment. (T-1) The ADAPT PM will ensure that any mobility
   restrictions are noted and that profiles recommendations are completed IAW AFI 10-203 &
   AFI 48-123. (T-1)
      3.19.1.3. The ADAPT PM or CADC will monitor patient status and progress in
      treatment to determine the appropriateness for continuation or termination of the Duty
      Limiting Condition (DLC) at each visit and document. (T-1) Guidance concerning the
      use of DLC can be found in AFI 10-203, Duty Limiting Conditions, and AFI 48-123,
      Medical Examinations and Standards. (T-1)
   3.19.2. PCS. Patients making minimal or unsatisfactory progress in recovery should not be
   allowed to proceed on TDYs or a PCS, except for mandatory PCS moves. (T-1) The TT will
   recommend to the commander that the individual not be released. (T-1) At times,
   exceptional circumstances may warrant other approaches. (T-1)
   3.19.3. Transferring ADAPT Treatment Information and Coordination of Care at the Time
   of Permanent Change of Station (PCS). The ADAPT Program will follow the guidelines for
   the transfer of MH records and coordination of care established IAW AFI 44-172. (T-1)
3.20. Special Duty Assignments or Designations\Members on Flight Status\Providers.
   3.20.1. Special Duty Assignments or Designations. Decisions regarding access to classified
   material, security clearances, PRP, PSP, or other special duty (other than flying) will be
   determined by governing instructions for each program (e.g. DoDDs, DoDIs, AFIs, etc.). (T-
   0)
   3.20.2. Flight Status. When a flight surgeon suspects a member on flying status of having a
   substance use problem, he or she is required to inform the member’s commander and to refer
   him/her to ADAPT for an evaluation. (T-1) If the member is diagnosed with a SUD, there
   are specific guidelines that must be followed including completion of treatment and
   continuing care (aftercare) program meeting timeframe requirements. (T-1) See AFI 48-123
   and AF Waiver Guide for additional information and guidance. (T-1)
AFI44-121 8 JULY 2014                                                                          29


   3.20.3. Impaired Privileged/Non-Privileged Providers. A provider may seek assistance for
   issues involving the abuse or misuse of substances voluntarily or involuntarily. Impaired
   providers typically require a specialized treatment program given the unique requirements of
   being a healthcare provider receiving treatment for a SUD. (T-1) If there is an ARM and the
   provider is seen in ADAPT or if the provider is diagnosed with a SUD, there are specific
   guidelines regarding AF credentialing that must be followed, as well as state licensing issues
   that must be considered. (T-1) See AFI 44-119 for additional information and guidance. (T-
   1) In order to ensure a provider who has completed the ADAPT program has continued to
   abstain from alcohol or prescription drugs, the provider will be randomly tested at the request
   of the commander for up to three years from completion of treatment, as a condition of
   privileging, and for non-privileged providers their continuation to provide patient care. (T-3)
3.21. Program Evaluation.
   3.21.1. Each ADAPT Program will implement a comprehensive evaluation of their clinical
   services that includes data collection from ADAPT clients receiving services on substance
   use and misuse, as well as the operation of SUD services. (T-0) ADAPT Program staff will
   utilize the data collected to make improvements to all aspects of the ADAPT Program
   including the prevention efforts. (T-0) This critical part of the ADAPT Program is essential
   for improving care for all ADAPT patients and recipients of prevention services. (T-0)
   3.21.2. Evaluation of the ABC Program (Level 0.5): In an effort to assess alcohol misuse and
   the impact of the ABC intervention, personnel participating in the ABC Program will
   complete assessments pre- and post- intervention. (T-0) As part of the SUAT, patients will
   complete the AUDIT. (T-0) In addition to the AUDIT, patients will be asked to complete a
   questionnaire standardized at AFMOA at 3 months that assesses the patient’s substance use
   and misuse, as well as learning objectives from the program, their perceptions of the content
   of intervention, and the satisfaction with the intervention and the staff. (T-0)
   3.21.3. AFMOA will track the following information, on at least a quarterly basis: (T-0)
      3.21.3.1. Prevalence and incidence of SUD (e.g. alcohol use disorder mild, moderate or
      severe, etc.) at each base. (T-0)
      3.21.3.2. The number of personnel receiving treatment, set apart by severity of specific
      diagnoses (must be able to track diagnosis and severity by month, by quarter, by year).
      (T-0)
      3.21.3.3. Active duty retention status (e.g. return to duty, separated) at time of discharge
      from treatment. (T-0)
      3.21.3.4. Program referral type (e.g. self, command, medical). (T-0)
      3.21.3.5. Number of patients who successfully completed the ABC Program. (T-0)
      3.21.3.6. Number of patients who were treated in outpatient, IOP, PHP, rehabilitation,
      and inpatient programs. (T-0)
      3.21.3.7. Number of patients who successfully completed the treatment and aftercare
      programs. (T-0)
   3.21.4. During continuing care (aftercare), a standardized measure provided by AFMOA will
   be utilized at 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment to assess patients’ substance use and misuse,
 30                                                                   AFI44-121 8 JULY 2014


   as well as current work performance, ability to cope, their perceptions of the content of
   interventions, and the satisfaction with treatment, aftercare and the staff. (T-1) Follow-up
   assessments at 3, 6, and 12 months are to be completed using the survey monkey assessments
   developed by AFMOA. (T-3)
      3.21.4.1. Follow-up assessments at 3, 6, and 12 months for those former ADAPT
      patients who have been administratively or medically discharged from service may be
      difficult or impossible to contact for outcome measures. Attempts to contact any former
      ADAPT patients should be documented appropriately in their MH record. (T-3)
   3.21.5. AFMOA will track referrals by type and will also monitor for a reoccurrence of
   ARM following ABC, as well as following continuing care (aftercare) (T-0)
3.22. Training.
   3.22.1. Training Mission.  The ADAPT Program's mission includes oversight and
   management of substance misuse-related education for MH staff who are currently working
   in ADAPT or MH technicians who are expected to rotate to ADAPT. (T-1)
   3.22.2. Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment Program Managers (ADAPT
   PMs).
      3.22.2.1. ADAPT PMs are responsible for ensuring they are competent for their duties.
      (T-0) This means they must obtain the appropriate education and supervision needed to
      develop and maintain competency in substance misuse assessment, prevention, and
      treatment. (T-0) Competency will be defined by the provider's experience, consultation
      with supervisors, training and their own ethical and licensure requirements. (T-0)
      3.22.2.2. Lack of clinical experience or course work in substance misuse does not
      preclude a provider from working in the ADAPT Program. (T-2) In this situation, the
      provider and their supervisor will be responsible for establishing a training plan to
      develop competency and ensure appropriate oversight until competency is attained. (T-1)
      3.22.2.3. If additional ADAPT PM education is required, the written training plan may
      include, but is not limited to, review of the research, peer consultation, supervision,
      computer-based learning, and continuing education opportunities.
      3.22.2.4. ADAPT PM may develop written training and education plans to assist
      ADAPT technicians in meeting educational requirements as designated in the 4C Career
      Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) and the AF Alcohol and Drug Counselor
      Certification Handbook. (T-0) The ADAPT PM will develop written training and
      education plans to maintain education currency of existing ADAPT technicians and to
      promote substance-related skill development in new provider and technician staff. (T-0)
          3.22.2.4.1. Education plans and goals will be tailored to individual needs. (T-0)
          3.22.2.4.2. Content will focus on evidence-based assessment, prevention and
          treatment approaches to reduce alcohol and drug misuse. (T-0)
3.23. Certified Alcohol and Drug Counselors (CADCs).
   3.23.1. CADCs are responsible for ensuring they maintain their competencies and
   continuing education requirements to maintain their certification. (T-0)
AFI44-121 8 JULY 2014                                                                  31


  3.23.2. Responsibilities include oversight and supervision of non-CADC MH technicians to
  help them develop the skills and competencies required for certification. (T-0)

Terms
Abstinence—The practice of refraining from the consumption or use of alcohol and other
intoxicating substances.
Active Guard/Reserve (AGR)—National Guard or Reserve Members who are on voluntary AD
providing full-time support to National Guard, Reserve, and Active Component organizations for
the purpose of organizing, administering, recruiting, instructing, or training the Reserve
Components. Although they continue to be members of the Reserve Components, they are in a
different federal status than traditional part-time Army Reserve Component or Air Reserve.
Component members (including full—time Army Reserve Technician and Air Reserve
Technician Program members) called to AD for training, special work, operational support to the
Active Component, or mobilized for contingency operations. AGR personnel also receive the
same benefits and entitlements as Army and AF Active Component military personnel.
Air Reserve Components (ARC)—All units, organizations, and members of the Air National
Guard (ANG) of the US and the USAF Reserve (USAFR).
Air Reserve Technician (ART)—ARTs are the core managers and trainers conducting day-to-
day ARC unit operations. They serve as full-time civil service employees of the USAF and
serve as Traditional Reservists in the same unit.
Alcohol Abuse—See DSM-IV-TR for diagnostic criteria.
Alcohol Dependence—See DSM-IV-TR for diagnostic criteria.
Alcohol—Related Misconduct (ARM)—This type of conduct includes driving while
intoxicated, public incidents of intoxication and misconduct, underage drinking, or similar

their experience, strength, and hope that they may solve their common problem and help others
to recover from alcoholism.
Centralized Credentials Quality Assurance System (CCQAS)—A web based software
application for credentials, privileging, adverse action and risk management database utilized
within DoD. The CCQAS software assists the credentials and risk managers with the control of
credentials, managing the credentialing/privileging process, adverse actions, medical malpractice
claim process, report generation, letter generation, MTF to MTF transfer of the electronic PCF,
and inter-facility transfer briefs. MTF credentials and risk managers use CCQAS information for
generating DoD and congressional reports, personnel management, quality assurance, and for
performance improvement activities.
Certified Alcohol and Drug Counselor (CADC)—In the USAF, they are typically MH
technicians who serve in clinical roles in the ADAPT Program (formerly referred to as Certified
Alcohol and Drug Abuse Counselors, or CADACs). CADCs can also be officers. They provide
services in the following 12 core functions outlined by the IC&RC: screening, intake,
orientation, assessment, treatment planning, counseling, case management, crisis intervention,
education, referral, report and record keeping, and consultation. See the AF Alcohol and Drug
Counselor Certification Handbook for additional requirements to become a CADC.

time. IMAs report for duty a minimum of one day a month and 12 additional days a year.

to another level (discharge/transfer criteria). PPC generally describe the settings, staff, and
services appropriate to each level of care and establish guidelines based on alcohol or other drug
diagnosis and other specific areas of patient assessment.
