                                       INTRODUCTION
1. This qualification training package (QTP) was developed to make available a training aid which will
assist Diet Therapy Technicians develop technical skills essential to performing specialized tasks. The
tasks are broken down into teachable elements, which help the trainer guide the trainee into becoming
proficient with the tasks. The QTP will also aid the task certifier when evaluating trainees for task
certification.

2. As a trainer, direct the trainee to review the training references to better understand the objective of
each module. Go through the steps in the task performance with the trainee and allow for enough time to
learn each step; some objectives may take more time than others. Remember that the objective of this
QTP is to ensure the trainee can perform each task thoroughly. When the trainee receives enough training
and is ready to be evaluated on an objective, follow the evaluation instructions. Use the performance
checklist as you evaluate each objective. If the trainee successfully accomplishes the objective, document
appropriately in the individual’s training record. If the trainee does not accomplish the objective, review
the areas needing more training until the objective is met. Conduct a feedback with the trainee on this
QTP. After you have ensured and documented that the trainee is qualified to perform the task, a certifier
should evaluate the trainee.

3. The goal of the developers of this QTP is to publish a useful document for trainers and trainees that
will meet Air Force needs under the concepts outlined in the Career Field Education and Training Plan
(CFETP). We value your expertise in meeting this goal. If you find discrepancies in this QTP, or have
suggestions for its improvement, or if you have suggestions for other areas that may benefit from a QTP,
please let us know about them.

9.   Role Playing

Teaching Method - Lecture
Presentation in which instructor addresses employees by means of one-way communication. Used in early
stages of learning to convey many concepts in a short period of time to many people. It limits participation
and may limit employees’ attention and interest.

Guidelines:
1. Know material to be covered.
2. Use visual aids to increase learning and focus attention.
3. Limit the time this method is used and the content.
4. Allow time regularly for a question and answer period

Lecture – Examples
1. Show hazardous chemicals. Explain purpose of MSDS. Explain rules of safe chemical handling and use.
    (HAZMAT)
2. Explain your facility’s policy on patient rights – Clearly state that patients also have a right to quality service.
    (Quality Patient service)

Teaching Method – Guided Discussion
Interaction between the instructor and employees as the instructor poses questions for employees to answer.
Allows employees to participate and to be recognized for knowledge of certain topics. It requires more
time than lecture, but well worth it because employees become involved in own learning, which will
increase retention.

Guidelines:
1. Avoid questions with “Yes-No” answers and very easy questions.
2. Always reinforce when employee gives a correct answer by saying “That’s right!” or “ Thank you for the
   correct answer.”
3. Be tactful when employee gives the wrong answer. Never tell employee in front of class his/her answer is
   wrong. Instead, give encouraging feedback—“Almost” or “You’re close.”
4. Be patient with employee answers.
5. Know your material because employees will be more apt to ask questions with this method.
6. Be alert to avoid wandering off to other topics.




QTP 4D071-6                                            7                                           APRIL 2000
                            Conduct In-Service Education Programs

Guided Discussion - Examples
1. Ask the employees to explain the terms: food borne illness, bacteria, and virus. Don’t judge their answers
because purpose is to show that these terms need further explanation, which will be done in class. (Basics of Food
Borne Illnesses)

2. Explain how a food service worker can cause foodborne illness and ask employees for other ways in which they
might contaminate food, such as wearing a soiled apron (personal hygiene).

3. Ask employees to describe to you and the class situations when they were hurt working in a kitchen and why
the accident occurred. List on easel pad some typical food service accidents (Kitchen Safety).

4. Ask employees to give you different communication media. Write on ease pad. Next, ask for specific
advantages and disadvantages of each and write down.

Teaching Method – Demonstration
Presentations by instructor to show how to perform a certain skill or procedure, such as setting-up a three-
compartment sink. Useful in teaching manual skills and can focus attention on basic procedures and certain
standards of performance.

Guidelines:
1. Run through demonstration beforehand and make sure you are totally comfortable and competent at doing it.
2. Explain why each step is done as you do it.
3. Point out critical parts of the procedure.
4. Do not demonstrate too many steps at once. Teach in small, east-to-grasp chunks.
5. Follow with supervised practice.

Demonstration – Example
Do a mini-inspection of the dishwashing area with employees. Explain what you are doing and why.
Check thermometers for pre-wash, wash, and final rinse. Run test thermometer to check final rise
temperature. Check detergent and rinse additive dispensers. Check racks and conveyor belt to ensure they
are not overloaded. Check cleanliness of washed dishes (cleaning & sanitizing).

Teaching Method – Tell/Show/Do/Review

Four components – lecture (tell), demonstration (show), employee practice (do), and lecture (review).
Excellent for teaching new skill or procedure. Employees practice and apply the knowledge and skills
previously explained and demonstrated under controlled conditions and close supervision.

Guidelines:
1. Employees should have a listing of procedures either in hand or posted so they can follow them during practice.
2. Small groups – are best.
3. Supervise closely, and correct employees quickly.
4. Be sure all safety aspects of the process have been thoroughly discussed and demonstrated.
5. Give employees enough practice time in order to be proficient.
6. Allow enough time for this method as it is quite time consuming.

                            Conduct In-Service Education Programs

Tell/Show/Do/Review - Examples
1. Explain how to wash hands. Demonstrate. Ask employees to practice and coach. (Review eight steps of hand
    washing)
2. Go over how to set up a three-compartment sink (cleaning and sanitizing).
3. Explain safety precautions for each piece of equipment. Demonstrate precautions. Let employees practice.
    Review safety precautions (Working Safely With Equipment).
4. Hand out copies of exchange system. Go over steps on how to use the lists. Demonstrate using the lists. Hand
    out blank menus and meal patterns to use to fill out the menus. Review steps. (Modify menus for Cal and
    CHO.)


Teaching Method – Exercise
Type of quiz given to employees to do during class, such as a set of matching questions. It is not graded by
the instructor, but rather is corrected in class with the employees correcting his/her own papers. Exercises
are not handed in and are kept by employee. Another type of exercise is not a quiz of knowledge; rather, it
is an exercise in which employees set personal goals to monitor themselves. Example: Ask employees to
set goals to improve patient service skills.

Guidelines:
1. Read instructions to the employees so you are sure they understand what to do.
2. Explain that the exercise will not be seen or graded by you, but only for them to use.
3. Always review answers promptly. Ask employees to volunteer answers first before giving correct answer so as
   to involve them.
4. Make sure all the employees have completed the exercise by checking to see if anyone is still writing before
   going over the answers.
5. Bring extra pens and pencils to class.

Exercise - Examples
1. Pass out handout of warm-up questions and ask employees to complete in 5 minutes and review answers
   (Basics of Food Borne illnesses).
2. Have employees work in pairs on exercise: Recipe conversion (using recipes). Exercise: Your recipe is for 50
   portions. You need to adjust it to 125 portions. What is the multiplier?

Method - Case Study
Definition: Description of a real-life situation, event, or incident that the employee or group of employees
analyze and discuss; usually through answering specific questions. It allows an opportunity to analyze
information and to use newly acquired skills and knowledge. Answers to the questions should be discussed
in class.

Guidelines:
1. Monitor the groups to make sure they have not wandered off track.
2. If group members are not participating at all in the group discussions ask them a question that will get them
   involved in the discussion.
3. Make sure each group has a person recording the discussion.
4. When writing down each group’s key discussion points, either write each group’s points separately, or put them
   all together. When putting together all their responses, don’t write down the same response twice. If a group
   gives you the same response but worded differently, explain that they are saying the same thing.
5. Give adequate time for all groups to respond.

Case Study - Example
Pass out handout. Have individuals read the case study and ask them to point out what was wrong and right with the
case.

                            Conduct In-Service Education Programs


Teaching Method – BUZZ Groups
Employees split into small groups of two to four people to discuss a specific topic and then are asked to
report key discussion points back to the larger group. Instructor may write down these points on a board or
easel pad.

Guidelines:
Same as “Case Study.”

BUZZ Group - Example
1. Ask employees to work in small groups (2-4) and have each group list as many applications of each necessity of
safe food handling as possible. Such as necessity: store foods properly. Application: Cover, label, date and time
food in storage. Rotate foods. Store off floor 6 inches, etc. (Safe Food Handling Techniques)
2. Come up with list of 14 general equipment safety rules. (Working Safely with Equipment)
3. Ask each group to write down in 5 minutes as many ideas as possible on how to be a better listener. Ask one
member of each group to read his/her list as you write ideas on easel pad. Give prize to the group with the largest
number of usable answers. (How to Handle Patient Complaints)

Teaching Method – Role-Playing
Employees simulate or act out a real or hypothetical situation involving two or more people. Can be used
to examine current behaviors or try out new ones to build skill and confidence. Usually followed by
discussion and analysis among its participants. Role-playing enables evaluation and coaching from peers
and the instructor.

Guidelines:
1. Always demonstrate role-playing first before the employees try it.
2. Understand that some employees will think it is silly. Explain to them that it gives them a chance to try out a
   new behavior in a relatively safe situation.
3. Keep the class size small.
4. Coach closely.
5. Give lots of positive reinforcement and correct tactfully.

Role Playing - Examples
1. Ask employees to form groups of three and have each pick one of the role-play situations. Explain one
    employee will be the patient, one will be the employee, and third member will observe. After the role-
    play is completed, the group is to evaluate how well the complaint was handled.
2. Alternate – Ask an employee to be the patient and you be the employee who exhibits poor listening
    behavior. After, ask employees what you did wrong and how you could improve your listening. Write
    responses on easel pad. Repeat role-play, demonstrating good listening behavior.

Teaching Method - Game
Structured competition designed to provide opportunities to bring out specific knowledge, might be a board
game or any situation in which employees work alone or in teams and compete for a prize. The contest is
governed by a set of rules. This method is very participative and well accepted and it provides a change of
pace.

Guidelines:
1. Make sure the rules are explicit and communicated well.
2. Have a prize that is desired by most of the employees playing and of appropriate value.
3. When employees pick their own teams, make sure everyone is on a team.
4. Make sure there is enough time to complete the game once it is started.
