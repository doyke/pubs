                                                Chapter 1

                                                 POLICY

1.1. General. Those who use this instruction should bear in mind that an infinite number of variations are
available and that the cargo compartment configurations listed here are the most typical encountered day
to day.

1.2. Responsibilities. Personnel engaged in planning operations must consider the most appropriate con-
figuration that will satisfy mission requirements and permit minimum variations and man-hours to
change. Units performing services on the MC-130E aircraft (e.g., maintenance, life support) are responsi-
ble for configuring the aircraft IAW this instruction and as outlined in mission directives to include the
stowage/installation of equipment IAW the configuration and equipment tables outlined herein.

1.3. Codes. Use the following codes when referring to MC-130E cargo compartment configuration. The
letter code will be followed by a number identifying configuration capability.
    1.3.1. AE - Aeromedical Evacuation
    1.3.2. C - Cargo
    1.3.3. CP - Cargo and Passengers
    1.3.4. LP - PSYOPS
    1.3.5. P - Passenger
    1.3.6. RAPID - Infil/Exfil Equipment or Personnel
    1.3.7. TAC - Tactical Airdrop Equipment
    1.3.8. TAP - Tactical Airdrop Personnel

1.4. Modifications. The coded configurations of this regulation may require modification for a specific
mission. Each modification must be carefully evaluated prior to mission execution to ensure maximum
flight safety and compatibility with aircraft equipment. Each mission directive will identify the basic con-
figuration by code and the modification, if necessary, to satisfy mission requirements. For example, a
cargo mission may require additional seats or equipment such as a bulldog winch not in the C-X cargo
configuration. Indicate the mission directive configuration C-X (number as applicable) and modification,
e.g., two additional seats and bulldog winch required.

1.5. Weight and Balance.
    1.5.1. Configuration and necessary equipment changes to conduct special operations missions affect
    the weight and balance of the aircraft. To standardize equipment and the location of equipment, items
    shown in Table 2.1. will be included in the basic weight of the aircraft and remain on the aircraft
    except for maintenance, inspection and when removal is directed by this AFI. Equipment listed in
    Table 2.2. will be added as necessary and entered on DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clear-
    ance Form F, reference 5, 6, or 7. For simplicity the loadmaster will (when preparing the DD Form
    365-4 Form F) enter the weight contained in the equipment tables for the applicable configuration.
AFI11-2MC-130V3ADDA 9 NOVEMBER 2004                                                                      5


   Adjustments will be made when the actual on-board weight of an item varies from data shown. DD
   Form 365-4 will be completed IAW instructions in Chapter 5.
   1.5.2. When a configuration change that removes items listed in Table 2.1. is accomplished at a For-
   ward Operating Location (FOL) and no Quality Assurance Branch (QA) weight and balance authority
   is deployed to the location, maintenance personnel will put an info note in the AFTO Form 781A,
   Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document indicating the weight, fuselage station and moment
   of any equipment added or removed. The loadmaster will add or subtract the listed weight and
   moment from the last entry in the DD Form 365-3, Chart C. Annotate the new weight and moment in
   Block 1 of DD 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance Form F. Configuration changes accomplished
   at home station require a QA update to the DD Form 365-3, Chart C. EXCEPTION: Minor equipment
   changes after crew reporting may be annotated on the DD 365-4, by the loadmaster.
NOTE: Operations Group Stan/Eval assisted by Quality Assurance will develop a list of the items
removed when configuring the aircraft for RAPID 1 and 2. Stan/Eval will provide what items will be
removed Quality Assurance will provide the weight, fuselage station, and moment for each item. File the
list behind the DD Form 365-3. This list will be used when making corrections at a forward operating
location IAW paragraph 1.5.2.

1.6. Distribution. Commanders are responsible for bringing this publication to the attention of all
affected personnel. At least one copy will be maintained in the unit operations section. It will be readily
accessible to operations and aircrew personnel. Additional distribution will be as follows:
   1.6.1. Staff operations, all levels.
   1.6.2. All levels of aircrew standardization offices.
   1.6.3. Command posts/operations centers.
   1.6.4. Air terminal operations centers (AFSOC)
   1.6.5. Aerial Delivery Support Branch (ADSB)/Aerial Delivery Flight (ADF).
   1.6.6. Aircraft maintenance squadrons/units, Dash 21 equipment sections, Quality Assurance sec-
   tions.
   1.6.7. Aircrew Life Support sections.
   1.6.8. One located in the supplemental weight and balance handbook binder on each aircraft.
   1.6.9. One copy to each MC-130E loadmaster.

1.7. Revisions. All revisions will consist of electronic interim change (IC) or new publication. Personnel
at all echelons are encouraged to make recommendations to improve this instruction. Direct proposed
changes, to AFSOC/DOV in accordance with AFI 11-202 Vol 2 Attachment 5 and AFI 11-215, Attach-
ment 3. Use AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication.

1.8. Supplements. Subordinate unit supplements to this instruction that change the basic policies, proce-
dures, or formats prescribed herein are prohibited. EXCEPTION: Groups may supplement Table 2.2.
with additional items. They may also supplement Chapter 3 with specified configuration modifications
(MOD) to accommodate theater unique requirements. Forward supplements to HQ AFSOC/DOV for
approval.

NOTES:
1. Minimum equipment required. Units may add more equipment to meet specific mission or the-
   ater requirements. At all times the amount of tiedown equipment required will include enough
   equipment to secure the landing gear in an emergency as well as secure all cargo and loose
   equipment. When additional equipment is added, QA will update the DD Form 365-3, Chart C,
   Basic Weight and Balance Record. (See exception in paragraph 1.5. of this AFI.).
2. Minimum number of ground loading ramps required. More ramps will be added for RAPID
   configurations. Generation IV ramps are required for RAPID configurations. A full set of
   Canary Slides may be used in lieu of ground loading ramps.
3. Minimum life support equipment required.
4. The number of raft spaces dictates the total number of personnel (crew and passengers) that
   may be on the aircraft for over-water missions. In other words, if you have three 20 man rafts
   installed you can only have 60 personnel, including crew, on board for over-water missions.
5. All two-gallon emergency water containers will be stored empty. If mission dictates, containers
   will be sanitized and filled with water by support personnel. Annotate in 781K emergency
   water containers are full. After the mission, sanitize and dry containers then reinstall. When the
   water containers are filled the DD Form 365-3, Chart C, Basic Weight and Balance Record
   will be updated to reflect the added weight. (See exception in paragraph 1.5. of this AFI.)

                                            REFERENCE DATA

4.1. General. This chapter contains reference data to assist personnel in load planning.

4.2. Emergency Exits and Safety Aisles. Load aircraft in such a manner that the following emergency
exits and safety aisles are available.
NOTE: ISU-90 Containers without aisle ways do not meet minimum safety aisle requirements and will
not be shipped on MC-130E aircraft in pallet position number 3, 4, 5 or 6. When shipped in pallet position
2, minimum safety aisle requirements can be met, however this position is not normally used because of
weight and balance limitations.
     4.2.1. At least one cabin emergency exit is unobstructed.
     4.2.2. At least one unobstructed emergency exit is available for each 20 passengers/troops. This does
     not restrict over water flights if the three overhead escape hatches are available for egress. Litters and
     seats erected across an emergency exit are not considered as an obstruction.
     4.2.3. When passengers are airlifted, there will be an unobstructed aisle way in pallet positions 3, 4 &
     5 and ramp area (pallet position 6) to provide access to emergency exits. In pallet position 3, 4 & 5 the
     aisle way will be a minimum of 14 inches wide between the outer edge of the cargo and the aircraft
     and will begin at the cargo floor or dual rail outboard frame. Tiedown equipment (463L nets, straps,
     chains, and devices) are not normally considered an obstruction. The dual rail outboard frame pro-
     vides 8 inches of the 14-inch requirement on the main cargo floor. In the ramp area the aisle way will
     be a minimum of 8 inches beginning at the outboard edge of the dual rail frame. The aisle way should
     normally be on the left side of the aircraft. If the aisle way is placed on the right side of the aircraft,
     then clearance to the right side of the aircraft must be maintained. Access to aft latrine facilities
     requires an 18-inch clear area on the forward left side of the ramp. (Reference Figure 4.1.)
     4.2.4. If the safety aisle way requirement in 4.2.3. is not available on missions carrying crew only or
     mission essential personnel authorized by operations order/plan or COMAFSOF, then an aisle way
     will be maintained in pallet position 3, 4 & 5 that provides a minimum of 14 inches between the outer
     edge of the cargo and aircraft beginning no higher than 36 inches above the floor/pallet/ platform or a
     minimum of 30 inches between the outer edge and the aircraft beginning no higher than 60 inches
     above the floor/pallet/platform, the dual rail outboard frame provides 8 inches of this requirement on
     the main cargo floor. (Reference Figure 4.1.)
     4.2.5. During airdrop missions, loadmasters shall have access to the rear of the aircraft to accomplish
     tactical checklists.
     4.2.6. On all missions, cargo will be loaded in such a way that the crew will have access to the rear of
     the aircraft. The aircraft commander is the final authority for determining if safety aisles and/or access
     aft of cargo is adequate. Cargo loads in section VI of T.O.1C-130A-9 are specific and do not require a
     waiver.

                                                 Chapter 5

                                   DD FORM 365-4 INSTRUCTIONS

5.1. Introduction. This chapter provides instructions for computation and completion of DD Form 365-4,
(Weight and Balance Clearance Form F). The Form F will be computed using simplified moments. All
entries and signatures must be legible.

5.2. Load Planning. The cargo load must be planned so that the center of gravity of the loaded aircraft
will be within the specified forward and aft limits for any given operating condition. Consideration must
be given to offload sequence, aircraft limitations, and emergency jettisoning.

5.3. General Instructions. These instructions apply to forms using simplified moments.
     5.3.1. DD Form 365-4 Heading. Enter date, mission number, aircraft type, serial number, departure
     and destination station (name or ICAO identifier), aircraft’s home station and pilot's rank and last
     name.
     5.3.2. Limitations Column. Enter appropriate weight and C/G limits for the planned mission using the
     following criteria: The maximum gross weight and center of gravity limits specified in
     T.O.1C-130(M)E-1 will not be exceeded. Gross weight may also be limited by operating conditions;
     i.e., obstacle clearance, rate of climb, weather conditions, altitude, runway/taxiway bearing capacity,
     or any other published restrictions. The pilot/flight engineer will inform the loadmaster of any gross
     weight restrictions prior to the mission so an accurate allowable cabin load (ACL) may be obtained.
        5.3.2.1. Takeoff. Unless other restrictions are imposed, use 154,000 allowable gross weight for C/
        MC-130 aircraft, and subtract the total aircraft weight (Reference 12). Use 155,000 lbs on mis-
        sions scheduled to proceed without engine run-up prior to takeoff.
NOTE: IAW T.O.1-1B-50, and aircraft flight manual, the C/MC-130 aircraft's allowable gross weight for
takeoff is limited by maximum taxi gross weight. One thousand pounds is subtracted from the allowable
gross weight for takeoff on all AFSOC assigned/gained C/MC-130 aircraft weight and balance clearance
forms. Annotation is not required in the remarks block.
        5.3.2.2. Landing. Unless other landing restrictions are imposed, use 155,000 for C/MC-130 air-
        craft, and subtract operating weight plus estimated landing fuel (References 9 and 23).
        5.3.2.3. Limiting Wing Fuel. Compute IAW limiting wing fuel charts in Table 5.1. and Table 5.2
        of this instruction or the charts in section V of T.O.1C-130(M)E-1 for takeoff and landing. The
        most restrictive weight will be used.
NOTE: The limiting wing fuel chart in this instruction is based on a 2.5 G maneuver load factor with
indicated airspeed restrictions outlined in area "C" of the flight manual limiting wing fuel charts. When
specific mission requirements exceed the limitations outlined in area "C" of the limiting wing fuel charts,
the loadmaster must compute limitations using the appropriate flight manual limiting wing fuel chart in
section V of T.O.1C-130(M)E-1.
NOTE: Enter the allowable gross weight for limiting wing fuel and subtract the operating weight (Refer-
ence 9) to determine limiting wing fuel allowable cargo load (ACL).

       5.3.2.4. Permissible C/G Takeoff and Landing. Compute the forward and aft center of gravity lim-
       itations using the center of gravity table in T.O.1C-130E-5. The permissible CG zero fuel weight
       blocks will be left blank.
   5.3.3. Signature Block:
       5.3.3.1. Computed by: signature, rank, and organization.
       5.3.3.2. Weight and Balance authority: Leave blank
       5.3.3.3. Pilot: Signature on original and duplicate.

5.4. Instructions for Moment Form F. Use T.O. 1C-130E-5, T.O.1C-130(M)E-5, and Chart E.
   5.4.1. Remarks section.
       5.4.1.1. Enter a breakdown of takeoff fuel weight for each tank to the nearest 100 pounds and
       moments using the fuel moment tables contained in T.O. 1C-130(M)E-5.
NOTE: An alternate method of computing fuel moments is accomplished by multiplying the total fuel
(except fuselage tank fuel) by .552. When using the alternate method of computing fuel moments, a
breakdown of takeoff fuel weight for each tank to the nearest 100 pounds will be entered in the remarks
section.
NOTE: Takeoff fuel is 1,000 pounds less than ramp fuel (500 pounds is subtracted from inboard and out-
board tanks). This is the fuel used for engine start, taxi and engine run up.

Exception: Missions scheduled to proceed without engine run-up prior to takeoff.
       5.4.1.2. Enter estimated fuel burn off (FBO) below the total takeoff fuel. Subtract anticipated fuel
       burn off from total take off fuel. If no HAR or AR is anticipated, this is your estimated landing fuel
       (ELF). Enter the break down of ELF and total ELF in the remarks block.
NOTE: Use the following criteria to compute in-flight fuel consumption:
First hour of flight (climb-out)              6000 PPH
Normal flight at altitude                     4500 PPH
Low altitude flight (low level)               6000 PPH
       5.4.1.3. Enter anticipated fuel on load for AR (label it as AR) and anticipated fuel offload HAR
       (label it as HAR) below the anticipated FBO. Add and subtract as appropriate AR, HAR and FBO
       to arrive at ELF. Enter the break down of ELF and total ELF in the remarks block.
   5.4.2. Reference 1. Enter basic weight and moment from the last entry of the certified copy of the DD
   Form 365-3, Weight and Balance Record, Chart C in the aircraft weight and balance handbook.

5.5. Limiting Wing Fuel. The following table may be used to determine maximum limiting wing fuel
ACL for a given fuel load when in primary fuel management. Use the appropriate chart in the T.O.
1C-130(M)E-1 for aircraft in Secondary Fuel Management. Fuel weights are expressed in thousands. For
fuel weights between chart weights, go to nearest fuel weight to determine base weight. Both takeoff and
landing conditions must be calculated. The most restrictive will be placed on the DD-365-4, Weight and
Balance Clearance Form F - Transport.
     5.5.1. Instructions for primary fuel management. Table 5.1. is based on the recommended areas
     (Areas A, B, and C) of the Weight Limitations Chart (Primary Fuel Management) (Non Air Refueling
     Mission) With Foam In Fuel Tanks - With Refueling Pods. For Operations that do not meet these cri-
     teria, use the appropriate chart in T.O. 1C-130(M)P-1, Section V, to determine ACL.
