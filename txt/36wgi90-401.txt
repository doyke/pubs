1. 36th Wing Policy Regarding High-Level Inquiries.
     1.1. Members of the 36 WG will respond promptly, accurately and fully to all High-Level
     inquiries. For the purpose of this instruction, High-Level inquiries are defined as requests for
     information originating from the White House, Members of Congress or their staffs, and
     Government of Guam Officials or their staff that go beyond the level of routine
     communication. High-Level inquiries normally flow via the Secretary of the Air Force,
     Office of Legislative Liaison (SAF/LL), but may come to the 36 WG directly from the
     source.
     1.2. If a High-Level inquiry is received directly by a 36 WG unit, contact the 36 WG/IG for
     directions on answering the query. The 36 WG/IG will coordinate with SAF/LLI to
     determine response actions to inquiries. The 36 WG/IG is responsible for ensuring the 36
     WG/CC is aware of all High-Level inquiries. See Attachment 2 for High-Level inquiry
     checklist.
     1.3. The 36 WG/CC is the approval authority for all responses to High-Level inquiries.
     Exception: 36 WG/JA will follow procedures described in AFI 51-201, Administration of
     Military Justice, when responding to requests for information from AFLOA/JAJM.
        1.3.1. The 36 WG/CC will sign all responses to High-Level inquiries. The 36 WG/CC
        may delegate this to the 36 WG/CV or a Group Commander on a case-by-case basis.
2. 36 WG/IG Responsibilities.
     2.1. The 36 WG/IG will be the POC for all High-Level inquiries affecting the 36 WG.
        2.1.1. Upon receipt of an inquiry, the 36 WG/IG will immediately coordinate with the 36
        WG/CC (36 WG/CV if the 36 WG/CC is unavailable), and JA (if necessary) to determine
        an OPR and establish a suspense for the response. For issues pertaining to US Navy
        resourcing or policy, 36 WG/IG will refer the matter to the JRM IG to develop the
        response for Andersen AFB Base Commanding Officer approval.
            2.1.1.1. Responsibility for drafting replies to High-Level inquiries rests with the OPR
            at the flight, squadron, group, or division level with the functional expertise to answer
            the question.
        2.1.2. 36 WG/IG will notify the OPR of tasking and suspense.
        2.1.3. 36 WG/IG will route the signed response in accordance with AFI 90-401, Air
        Force Relations with Congress.
3. 36 WG OPR Responsibilities.
     3.1. OPRs will prepare an in-depth response that accurately answers all questions or
     concerns.
     3.2. IAW AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Act Program, and DoD Regulation 5400.11, DoD
     Privacy Program, Privacy Act records may not be released unless the subject of the record
     consents in writing through a Privacy Act Release statement (Attachment 4), or the release is
     authorized as an exception to the general rule of non-disclosure. Contact 36 WG/JA for
     assistance.    For personal medical information, a Health Insurance Portability and
     Accountability Act (HIPAA) release statement is generally required. Contact the 36 MDG
     for assistance with HIPAA information.
36WGI90-401 7 MAY 2014                                                                          3


   3.3. Timely response to High-Level inquiries is a command metric. OPRs will ensure
   responses are provided by the established suspense dates. The suspense date is the day the
   response will be ready for 36 WG/CC final review and signature. If a final reply cannot be
   forwarded within the established suspense date, immediately notify the 36 WG/IG. Do not
   attempt to contact the tasking agency for an extension. Do not wait until the suspense due
   date to request an extension.
   3.4. After all internal and lateral coordination is accomplished, the response will be
   delivered to the 36 WG/JA, then to 36 WG/IG. The OPR may hand deliver or email the
   response to the next office as required. OPRs will prepare an Air Force Form 1768, Staff
   Summary Sheet, or prepare an E-SSS with an appropriate response attached.
      3.4.1. The 36 WG/IG will review the response and forward to the 36 WG/CV and 36
      WG/CC, as required.
4. Follow-up Action.
   4.1. If the inquiry reveals an actual deficiency, follow-up action is required. The appropriate
   commander or division chief and the IG will determine if the deficiency is a one-time
   occurrence or if a systemic problem exists.
   4.2. If a systemic problem exists, the 36 WG/IG will write a finding against the appropriate
   flight, squadron, group, or division.
   4.3. The appropriate flight, squadron, group commander, or division chief will develop and
   implement a corrective action.
   4.4. The 36 WG/CC is the approval authority for corrective actions.
