This instruction outlines the McChord AFB Weapons Safety Program. The requirements established in
this instruction are derived directly from Air Force Instruction (AFI) 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap
Prevention Program, Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 91-201, Explosive Safety Standards, and Department
of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 6055.9, DoD Ammunition and Explosive Safety Standards. This instruction
applies to all personnel and units assigned or attached to McChord AFB.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This instruction has been
completely revised to incorporate changes/revisions from AFMAN 91-201 (Explosive Safety Standards)
and DOD 6055.9 (DOD Ammunition and Explosive Safety Standards.


1. Introduction and Scope:
   1.1. The 62d Airlift Wing (62 AW), as host, will manage the wing weapons safety program in accor-
   dance with (I.A.W.) AFI 91-202, paragraph 10.1.
   1.2. Units with explosives licenses, munitions, or explosives operations as defined in AFI 91-202,
   paragraph 10.1 and AMC Supplement 1, 24 January 2000, paragraph 10.1.1. will establish a weapons

   (ADWSR).

2. Weapons Safety Training and Education:
   2.1. Weapons Safety Education. Safety education is essential for a sound weapons safety program.
   TIG Brief, The Mobility Forum, Countermeasure Magazine, and many other periodicals are a source
   of safety information. 15 AF and AMC Safety Newsletters, as well as cross-tell and sanitized mishap
   reports give us lessons learned and can prevent similar occurrences on McChord AFB.
