    years service based on pay date to reenlist for 3, 4, or 5 years.
    1.3.3. Reenlists in a bonus AFSC in effect on the date of reenlistment.
    1.3.4. Has not previously received a Selected Reserve, reenlistment, or retraining bonus for service
    in any Reserve component. NOTE: The National Defense Authorization Act, 18 Nov 97, authorized
    a second 3-year reenlistment bonus (see note at para 2.1.3.3.).
    1.3.5. Is not reenlisting to qualify for a civilian position where membership in the Reserve is a condi-
    tion of employment.
    1.3.6. Is not reenlisting for retainability under the PALACE CHASE Program.
    1.3.7. Has no more than 14 years (exactly) total service based on pay date at the time of reenlistment.
    1.3.8. Is required to be a satisfactory participant (cannot have more than four unexcused absences) in
    the Air Force Reserve and has performed three consecutive authorized four-period unit training
    assemblies (UTA). This requirement can be met in any combination of UTA attendance immediately
    before or after the date of reenlistment. Two four-period UTAs performed after the date of reenlist-
    ment would meet the participation requirement. Once the participation requirement has been met, the
    date of entitlement for the incentive is the date of reenlistment. Periods of active duty that occur dur-
    ing a scheduled UTA are authorized substitutions for UTA requirements. NOTE: If a member has a
    bonus, reenlistment more than 30 days before their ETS requires a waiver from HQ AFRC/DPMB
    prior to reenlistment unless they are reenlisting for the Montgomery G.I. Bill. Although reenlistment
    for the G.I. Bill can take place at any time, it does not automatically make a member eligible for a
    reenlistment bonus.

1.4. Affiliation Incentive Eligibility Criteria. Member:
    1.4.1. Is affiliating directly from the regular Air Force or nonparticipating status (ARPC).
    1.4.2. Is required to have completed less than 6 years of their MSO (based on the member’s original
    6-year obligation).
AFI36-2638 26 JANUARY 2005                                                                                 7


   1.4.3. Is being assigned duty in a bonus AFSC in effect on the member’s effective date of change of
   strength accountability (EDCSA) assignment and possesses at least a three-level control AFSC
   (CAFSC) or second AFSC in that duty. EXCEPTION: Individuals assigned duty in an AFSC with a
   one-level who attend the same three-level technical course are eligible for the affiliation incentive,
   provided otherwise qualified.
   1.4.4. Has completed or was released early under honorable conditions from his or her active duty
   obligation and has a Reserve obligation under Section 651 of Title 10, U.S.C. or Section 6(d)(1) of the
   Military Selective Service Act.
   1.4.5. Has not previously participated in any active Reserve program.
   1.4.6. Is not affiliating under the PALACE CHASE Program.
   1.4.7. Is not affiliating to qualify for a civilian position where membership in the Reserve is a condi-
   tion of employment.

1.5. Retraining Guidance. The intent of the retraining bonus is to provide an incentive to those mem-
bers already assigned to a unit in a non-bonus AFSC to retrain and later reenlist into a bonus AFSC at
their current unit of assignment locale, that is, no change in servicing Military Personnel Flight (MPF)
identification (ID). Therefore,
if a member is transferring from one servicing MPF to another and is retraining and reenlisting concur-
rently with their transfer, he or she will not be eligible for a retraining bonus. For example, a member cur-
rently assigned to MPF servicing R9 in AFSC 4N0X1 (non-bonus) transferring to MPF servicing ID W9,
AFSC 2W0X1B (bonus) would not be eligible to receive a retraining incentive (bonus).

1.6. Retraining Incentive Eligibility Criteria. Member:
   1.6.1. Is assigned to the unit program in a non-bonus AFSC, reenlisting within the same wing or
   group (locale), who successfully completes the three-level retraining, and is awarded the three-level
   bonus CAFSC.
   1.6.2. Is retraining into a bonus DAFSC in effect on the date retraining is approved, that is, date
   entered Training Status Code (TSC) M, E.
   1.6.3. Has not previously received an Individual Ready Reserve (IRR), reenlistment, or retraining
   bonus for service in any Reserve component.
   1.6.4. Is not retraining to qualify for a civilian position where membership in the Reserve is a condi-
   tion of employment.
   1.6.5. Has less than 14 years total service (based on pay date) at the time of enlistment.
   1.6.6. Is a satisfactory participant in the Air Force Reserve and has performed three authorized
   four-period UTAs at the time of reenlistment.
   1.6.7. Is not applying for retraining concurrent with assignment to the Air Force Reserve, that is,
   coming from nonparticipating reserve status (ARPC), active duty, other units, or IMA program.
   1.6.8. Is not requesting reenlistment more than 36 months before current ETS. This does not include
   any extensions for retainability in retraining. The member cannot request reenlistment more than 30
   days before current ETS if currently receiving an enlistment or affiliation bonus. NOTE: Follow nor-

     mal retraining approval requirements according to AFMAN 36-8001, Reserve Personnel Participa-
     tion and Training Procedures. Service retainability, if required, is obtained through extension of
     current reenlistment. If the member requires more than 23 months of extension, reenlistment for a
     term of 2 years is authorized and the remaining retainability is by extension.

                                     INCENTIVE ELIGIBILITY

2.1. Incentive Eligibility Amounts. Refer to Table 2.1., Table 2.2., Table 2.3., Table 2.4., Table 2.5.,
Table 2.6. and Table 2.7. for payment schedules. NOTE: All bonuses are paid based on UTA participation
on the anniversary date of enlistment.
   2.1.1. Pay non-prior service bonuses upon entitlement to eligible persons in the amount of the vari-
   able (A1) in effect at the time of member’s enlistment. Authorized variable amounts are up to $2,000
   (before 1 October 1993), up to $5,000 (after 1 October 1993) and up to $8,000 (after 1 October 1999).
   NOTE: for NPS, entitlement begins with date of enlistment.
NOTE: If a member has a bonus and reenlists for more than 30 days before their ETS, a waiver is
required from HQ AFRC/DPMR prior to reenlistment unless reenlisting to satisfy retainability require-
ments for the Montgomery G.I. Bill. Although reenlistment for the G.I. Bill can take place at any time, it
does not automatically make a member eligible for a reenlistment bonus.
   2.1.2. Pay prior service bonuses upon entitlement to eligible persons in variable amounts as follows:
       2.1.2.1. Variable 5 - $1,250 for a member reenlisting for a term of 3 years before 1 July 1995, and
       $2,500 after 1 July 1995. (SeeTable 2.5.)
       2.1.2.2. Variable 6 - $2,500 for a member enlisting for a term of 6 years before 1 July 1995, and
       $5,000 after 1 July 1995. (See Table 2.5.)
       2.1.2.3. Variable A - $8000 for a member enlisting for a term of 6 years after 1 June 2003; Vari-
       able B - $4000 for a member enlisting for a term of 3 years after 1 June 2003, and Variable C -
       $3500 for a member reenlisting for a term of 3 years following a prior 3 year enlistment. (See
       Table 2.7.)
   2.1.3. Pay reenlistment or retraining bonuses upon entitlement to eligible members in variable
   amounts as follows:
       2.1.3.1. Variable 4 - $2,500 for a person enlisting for 6 years, possessing less than 6 years service
       based on pay date before 1 July 1995 and $5,000 after 1 July 1995. (See Table 2.5.)
       2.1.3.2. Variable 5 - $1,250 for a person possessing at least 6, but no more than 14 years (exactly)
       of total service based on pay date who reenlists for a period of 3, 4, or 5 years before 1 July 1995,
       and $2,500 after 1 July 1995. (See Table 2.5.)
       2.1.3.3. NOTE: A person may not be paid more than one 6-year enlistment or two 3-year enlist-
       ment/reenlistment bonuses. The second 3-year bonus is authorized only if the member enters into
       a subsequent reenlistment before the date, which the reenlistment/prior service enlistment for the
       first 3-year bonus expires, and still satisfies the designated skill or unit requirement for which a
       bonus is authorized.
   2.1.4. Pay affiliation bonuses upon entitlement to eligible members on a basis of $50 per month for
   each month of remaining obligated service. Determine remaining obligated service as follows: sub-
   tract EDCSA (YR and MO) from ETS (YR and MO). To determine ETS, subtract 2 years from ETO.

            2.1.4.1. If the member has 12 months or less remaining on their Reserve obligation at the time of
            affiliation, pay the total bonus at the sixth anniversary from their original enlistment (based on pay
            date).
            2.1.4.2. If the member has more than 12 months remaining on their Reserve obligation at the time
            of affiliation, pay the first 12 months upon completion of their fifth anniversary of their military
            service date from pay date, the remaining will be paid on the date of the sixth anniversary from
            original enlistment.

2.2. Briefing. The most frequent cause of inquiries and complaints on incentive bonuses stem from per-
sonnel who claim they were promised an incentive bonus. MPFs and recruiting personnel should exercise
care and discretion in explaining bonus eligibility and entitlement criteria, net amount of bonus, and the
fact that bonus AFSC lists change during the course of the fiscal year. Eligibility for a bonus depends on
the member meeting eligibility requirements and the bonus AFSC list in effect at the time of enlistment,
reenlistment, affiliation, or approval of retraining. Entitlement begins with approval of the AF Form
4021, Application for Incentive Participation, by HQ AFRC/DPMB. Emphasize eligibility and entitle-
ment along with bonus termination policies when counseling potential bonus recipients. Thorough brief-
ings on the bonus program may prevent unnecessary corrections of military records.

                                          BONUS AFSC LIST

3.1. Bonus AFSC List Selection:
   3.1.1. Wing and group commanders with the assistance of their personnel and recruiting functions
   identify specific AFSCs within their servicing jurisdiction, to include geographically separated units
   (GSU), that are eligible for an incentive.
      3.1.1.1. HQ AFRC/FM. Allocates and disburses funds in support of the Incentive Program.
   3.1.2. Specific AFSCs are defined as AFSCs within the authorized skills list provided by HQ AFRC/
   DPMB. For example, within authorized skills list AFSC 4N0X1, there are four specific AFSCs—
   4N0XI, 4N0X1A, 4N0X1B, and X4N0X1. The 4N0XX is not a specific AFSC. Each specific AFSC
   is reviewed and initially selected based on less than 100 percent “NONART” basewide manning to
   include GSUs. If manning in a specific AFSC is 100 percent or more, the AFSC cannot be selected as
   a bonus AFSC. Specific AFSCs manned at less than 100 percent can be selected; however, if assigned
   versus authorized difference is less than 10, then one or more of the following selection criteria are
   applied:
      3.1.2.1. Chronic and persistent shortages.
      3.1.2.2. Projected losses based on history.
      3.1.2.3. Projected unit manning document (UMD) increases.
      3.1.2.4. High replacement costs.
      3.1.2.5. Unattractive specialty.
      3.1.2.6. Historical difficulty in recruiting.
   3.1.3. If all specific AFSCs meet the criteria, the bonus AFSC is 4N0X1; if only prefix “X” meets the
   criteria, the bonus AFSC is X4N0X1; if only suffix A meets the criteria, the bonus AFSC is 4N0X1A
   and so forth.
   3.1.4. Each wing commander is authorized to select two additional UTC-tasks AFSCs not on the
   “master skills list” which are critical manned or present other manning issues as stated in paragraph
   3.1.2. USAF/RE is final approval authority for additional AFSCs.

3.2. Bonus List Processing:
   3.2.1. Send unit lists to arrive at HQ AFRC/DPMR no later than 15 August and 15 February of each
   year. Final approval authority for the incentive listing is USAF/RE.
   3.2.2. Lists by individual MPFs contain authorized, assigned, percent manning, and recommendation
   of MPF for each AFSC listed. The selection request requires an approval letter signed by the wing
   commander.
   3.2.3. HQ AFRC/DPMR prepares and distributes a consolidated list reflecting all authorized bonus
   AFSCs and applicable units. These lists are effective for the periods of 1 October through 31 March
   and 1 April through 30 September of each fiscal year. During this time, no AFSCs will be added or
22                                                              AFI36-2638 26 JANUARY 2005


     deleted. Once an AFSC is selected as a bonus AFSC, manning in that AFSC during the effective
     period of the lists is not an issue.

                              PROGRAM

7.1. Transfer. Unit to IMA program: If the member transferred from the unit program to the IMA pro-
gram after 8 Mar 01 continuation of the bonus is authorized if the AFSC is a bonus AFSC in the IMA pro-
gram. HQ ARPC/DPPRP, IMA Personnel Branch is the point of contact for the IMA program. IMAs
transferring to the unit program for duty on 1 June 1987 or later are automatically terminated by the gain-
ing MPF Wing CAA unless a waiver for continuation of bonus payments is requested. Continuation will
be approved providing the AFSC is a bonus AFSC in the unit of assignment on EDCSA and the member
is not transferring for personal reasons. Continuation is not authorized without approval from HQ AFRC/
DPMR. The gaining MPF/CAA pays the member a final payment if necessary and terminates the member
not meeting the continuation criteria. NOTE: If a member has a military spouse who is transferring to an
area where the AFSC is not a bonus, continuation may be requested. However, forward a copy of the
spouse's transfer order along with the request to HQ AFRC/DPMR.

        period in the Ready Reserve to cover the period of nonavailability so that upon return they are able
        to serve the full contract period for bonus. During the period of nonavailability, the member is not

        ing the period of nonavailability, the member is not entitled to subsequent incentive payments.

        puted by HQ AFRC/DPMB.
     8.1.5. Take withholding action when a member has incurred an authorized period of nonavailability.
        8.1.5.1. MPF/DPM (career enhancement) Retention Program Manager prepares a letter contain-
        ing the member’s grade, name, Social Security number, authorization number, and the date non-
        availability begins and sends it to HQ AFRC/DPMB. HQ AFRC/DPMB inputs PTI47K (B03
        Type 2) action with termination reason “7” (payment deferred).
AFI36-2638 26 JANUARY 2005                                                                             31

        Manager prepares a letter containing the member’s name, Social Security number, authorization
        number, date nonavailability began and ended, and date last incentive payment was made. HQ
        AFRC/DPMB reactivates the member’s incentive status by input of PTI47K (B03 Type 2) with
        termination reason “8” (payment released) and advises the MPF of adjusted anniversary date for
        future incremental payments.

     ager prepares a memo containing the member’s name, grade, Social Security number, authorization
     number, reason for reinstatement, and a statement that the member has maintained satisfactory partic-
     ipation. The letter must be signed by the member’s commander and forwarded to HQ AFRC/DPMB
     for action.
     8.2.2. HQ AFRC/DPMB approves the reinstatement via letter and input of PTI47R (B03 Type 3)

                                             BONUS AFSC LIST

10.1. Bonus AFSC List Selection. HQ ARPC/DPRPP obtains a listing of IMAs authorized and assigned
by AFSC. From that list, they identify IMA AFSCs manned at less than 100 percent. This list will be com-
pared to AFI 10-201, Status of Resources and Training System, Table 3.4. Any AFSC appearing on both
lists becomes a bonus AFSC for the IMA program.

10.2. Manning. If manning in a specific AFSC is 100 percent or more, the AFSC does not qualify to
receive a bonus. Specific AFSCs manned at 100 percent or less can qualify to receive a bonus; however if
the assigned versus authorized difference is less than 10, then one or more of the following criteria apply:
     10.2.1. Chronic and persistent shortages.
     10.2.2. Projected losses based on history.
     10.2.3. Projected unit manning document (UMD) increases.
     10.2.4. High replacement costs.
     10.2.5. Historical difficulty in recruiting or retraining.

10.3. Bonus List Processing. HQ ARPC/DPRPP distributes the final list to program managers and
recruiters in March and September of each year. The AFSC bonus listing is valid for a 6-month period
(released in March-effective 1 April through 30 September and released in September-effective 1 October
through 31 March). During this time, no AFSCs will be added or deleted, nor does manning in that AFSC
become an issue.

10.4. Program Mangers. Individual Reserve Program Managers are authorized to select four AFSCs
that are not on the “master skills list” which are critical manned or present other manning issues stated in
paragraph 3.1.2. USAF/RE is final approval authority for additional AFSCs.

                                  NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS

13.1. Requirements. Program managers or a delegated representative notifies, in writing, members
whose CAFSC is on the current bonus AFSC list. They must specify that the member must meet the other
eligibility requirements to receive an incentive. NOTE: Reenlistment, other than for the Montgomery
G.I. Bill, is only authorized during the 30 days preceding ETS.

13.2. Obligation, Participation and Agreement:
     13.2.1. To qualify for any incentive, the member obligates himself or herself contractually to serve
     satisfactorily in the Air Force Reserve for the full term of enlistment, reenlistment, or affiliation for
     which a bonus was paid. This individual further obligates himself or herself to continue to serve in the
     same bonus AFSC unless HQ ARPC/DAS approves continuation or termination.
     13.2.2. The member must meet fiscal year training requirements.
     13.2.3. At the time of enlistment, reenlistment, retraining, or affiliation, the member signs the written
     contract (AF Form 4010). This certifies that he or she has been informed of, and understands, the con-
     ditions under which the bonus payments are made. This agreement states the terms of the Reserve
     commitment which entitles the member to an incentive.

        TRANSFER BETWEEN AIR FORCE RESERVE UNITS AND IMA PROGRAM

14.1. Transfer and Continuation:
   14.1.1. Members who move from one location to another may continue bonus eligibility if they
   remain in the Selected Reserve of the USAFR and remain assigned to the same AFSC. The member
   has 6 months to obtain a position in the Selected Reserve in the same AFSC. If the member obtains a
   position within the 6 months, the time spent not actively participating in the bonus AFSC is added to
   the member’s service requirement. If the member does not obtain a position, their eligibility for a
   bonus will terminate.
   14.1.2. Members whose military specialty is changed for the convenience of the government or
   whose unit is inactivated, relocated, or converted (for example, weapons system conversion) may con-
   tinue entitlement to bonus payments provided they meet all other eligibility criteria, and are not sepa-
   rated from the Selected Reserve.
   14.1.3. If a member has a military spouse who is transferring to an area where the AFSC is not a
   bonus, the member may request continuation. The member must forward the request for continuation,
   as well as a copy of the spouse’s orders to HQ ARPC/DAS for approval.

14.2. Exception. Members affected by force reduction may continue in the bonus program. The follow-
ing rules apply:
   14.2.1. If given the opportunity to retrain into another AFSC, and the member accepts this option,
   then continuation is authorized.
   14.2.2. If given the opportunity to retrain and the member declines, the bonus terminates.
   14.2.3. If not given the opportunity to retrain, and the member is reassigned to a non-participating sta-
   tus (PAS S7xxxxxx), the bonus is terminated.

14.3. Nonavailability. Members may incur a period of nonavailability, for a period of no more than 3
years, for valid reasons as stated below. Nonavailability beyond 3 years results in bonus termination. HQ
ARPC/DAS assigns these members to the Standby Reserve during the period of nonavailability. Entitle-
ment to subsequent payments resumes on the adjusted bonus date based upon the previous payment
choice and approval by HQ ARPC/DAS.
   14.3.1. Personal Hardship.
   14.3.2. Community Hardship.
   14.3.3. Overseas Employment Obligation.
   14.3.4. Temporary Overseas Residence.
   14.3.5. Missionary Obligation
   14.3.6. Incentive payments stop for members assigned to the Standby Reserve for an authorized non-
   availability (for example, temporary overseas residence, missionary obligations, or overseas employ-
   ment obligations, etc.) without concurrent recoupment.
40                                                                      AFI36-2638 26 JANUARY 2005


     14.3.7. If later assigned to a participating status in the skill previously contracted for, members may
     be reinstated in the incentive program. The member must extend their term of service so they can
     serve the full original contract period. Payments resume on the adjusted bonus date.
     14.3.8. Application for an approved period of nonavailability, is made by letter to HQ ARPC/DA
     through the program manager or designated representative. Failure to extend the Reserve contract
     results in recoupment.
AFI36-2638 26 JANUARY 2005                                                                               41

                   TERMINATION, RECOUPMENT, AND REINSTATEMENT

15.1. Termination. If entitlement to an incentive is terminated for any reason before the fulfillment of
the service as specified in the written agreement, the member will not be eligible to receive any further
incentive payments, except for service performed before the termination date.
   15.1.1. The program manager, or delegated representative, completes the lower portion of AF Form
   4010, and includes the date termination begins. Send the form to HQ ARPC/DAS. HQ ARPC/DAS
   inputs to PDS the appropriate termination reason code and date of termination.
   15.1.2. Members incurring a period of nonavailability are not terminated, but will have the bonus
   payment suspended.
       15.1.2.1. The members are temporarily assigned to the Standby Reserve and do not receive their
       bonus payments. They are required to extend their enlistment or, reenlist in the Ready Reserve to
       cover the period of nonavailability. Once they return they are able to serve the full contract period
       for the bonus.
       15.1.2.2. During the period of nonavailability, the member is not entitled to subsequent incentive
       payments. The Program Manager (or delegated representative) takes withholding action when a
       member has incurred an authorized period of nonavailability. Prepares a letter containing the
       member's grade, name, Social Security Number (SSN), authorization number, and the date non-
       availability begins and send it to HQ ARPC/DAS.

15.2. Recoupment. If the member’s entitlement to a bonus is terminated, HQ ARPC/DAS notifies
AFRPO/FMFQ-P to begin recoupment. Unless granted relief, the member must refund a pro rata amount
to the government if the termination is for any of the reasons specified in Table 15.1. Relief may be
granted by HQ ARPC/DAS if any of the following occur.
   15.2.1. Injury, illness or other impairment NOT due to the airmen’s own misconduct.

   been terminated for unsatisfactory participation that was actually late submission of paid AF Form
   40a, Record of Individual Inactive Duty Training.
       15.3.1.1. The program manager, or delegated representative, prepares a letter containing the
       member's name, grade, SSN, reason for reinstatement, and a statement that the member has main-
       tained satisfactory participation. Send the letter to HQ ARPC/DAS along with the member’s AF
       Form 40a. HQ ARPC/DAS forwards the document to the Point Credit Office.
42                                                                    AFI36-2638 26 JANUARY 2005


        15.3.1.2. HQ ARPC/DAS approves or disapproves the reinstatement via letter to the Program
        Manager (or delegated representative). HQ ARPC/DAS inputs the appropriate transactions to
        PDS to remove termination information.
     15.3.2. Nonavailability. Upon the member's return from the period of authorized nonavailability:
        15.3.2.1. The program manager, or delegated representative, prepares a letter containing the
        member's name, grade, SSN, date nonavailability began and ended, and date of the last incentive
        payment.
        15.3.2.2. HQ ARPC/DAS reactivates the member's incentive status by input of the appropriate
        PDS transaction and advises the Program Manager (or delegated representative) of the adjusted
        bonus date for future incremental payments.

                        INTERIM CHANGE 2005-1 TO AFI 36-2638,
                  AIR FORCE RESERVE ENLISTED INCENTIVE PROGRAM
26 JANUARY 2005
SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision incorporates Interim Change IC 2005-1. The following changes to AFI 36-2638, USAFR
Enlisted Incentive Program are effective immediately, and will be included in the revision of the AFI. A
"|" indicates revised material since the last edition.
1.1.7. Is eligible for an enlistment incentive if an individual possesses a General Education Development
(GED) general equivalency certificate or a secondary school diploma or certificate awarded by a State,
based on certification by a parent or legal guardian that an individual has completed his/her secondary
school at home.
1.2.7. Has completed any active service commitment and possesses less than 14 years total service (based
on Armed Forces enlistment contractual agreement on pay date) at the time of enlistment. EXAMPLE:
A member who enlists in the Navy incurs a 4-year active duty commitment and 4 years reserve commit-
ment (total of an 8-year MSO). Once the member completes 4 years of active duty Armed Forces enlist-
ment contractual agreement, and subsequently, enlists in the Air Force Reserve, he is now eligible for a
Prior Service (PS) bonus, provided all other criteria established in AFI 36-2638 is met.
1.6.5. Has less than 14 years total service (based on pay date) at the time of enlistment.
2.1. Incentive Eligibility Amounts. Refer to Table 2.1., Table 2.2., Table 2.3., Table 2.4., Table 2.5.,
Table 2.6. and Table 2.7. for payment schedules. NOTE: All bonuses are paid based on UTA participa-
tion on the anniversary date of enlistment.
2.1.1. Pay non-prior service bonuses upon entitlement to eligible persons in the amount of the variable
(A1) in effect at the time of member’s enlistment. Authorized variable amounts are up to $2,000 (before
1 October 1993), up to $5,000 (after 1 October 1993) and up to $8,000 (after 1 October 1999). NOTE:
for NPS, entitlement begins with date of enlistment.
NOTE: If a member has a bonus and reenlists for more than 30 days before their ETS, a waiver is
required from HQ AFRC/DPMR prior to reenlistment unless reenlisting to satisfy retainability require-
ments for the Montgomery G.I. Bill. Although reenlistment for the G.I. Bill can take place at any time, it
does not automatically make a member eligible for a reenlistment bonus.
2.1.2.3. Variable A - $8000 for a member enlisting for a term of 6 years after 1 June 2003; Variable B -
$4000 for a member enlisting for a term of 3 years after 1 June 2003, and Variable C - $3500 for a member
reenlisting for a term of 3 years following a prior 3 year enlistment. (See Table 2.7.)
2.1.3.3. NOTE: A person may not be paid more than one 6-year enlistment or two 3-year enlistment/
reenlistment bonuses. The second 3-year bonus is authorized only if the member enters into a subsequent
reenlistment before the date, which the reenlistment/prior service enlistment for the first 3-year bonus
expires, and still satisfies the designated skill or unit requirement for which a bonus is authorized.
2.1.4.1. If the member has 12 months or less remaining on their Reserve obligation at the time of affilia-
tion, pay the total bonus at the sixth anniversary from their original enlistment (based on pay date).

2.1.4.2. If the member has more than 12 months remaining on their Reserve obligation at the time of affil-
iation, pay the first 12 months upon completion of their fifth anniversary of their military service date
from pay date, the remaining will be paid on the date of the sixth anniversary from original enlistment.
