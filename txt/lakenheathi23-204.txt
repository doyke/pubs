This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 23-2, Supplies and Materiel Manage-
ment, and interfaces with Department of Defense Directive (DODD) 4140.25, DoD Management Policy
for Energy Commodities and Related Services, and Technical Order (TO) 42B6-1-1, Quality Control of
Aviator’s Breathing Oxygen. It establishes requirements to comply with cryogenic conservation and
establish a LOX servicing schedule and applies to all units assigned to the 48th Fighter Wing. Refer rec-
ommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)
using AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, prescribed by AFI 11-215, USAF
Flight Manuals Program. Route AF Form 847s from the field through publications/forms managers.
Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 37-123 (will convert to AFMAN 33-363), Management of
Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located

1. LOX Servicing Schedule.
   1.1. 48th Logistics Readiness Squadron Management and Systems Flight (48 LRS/LGRF) will ser-
   vice carts Monday through Friday between the hours of 1300-1500. Owning organizations are respon-
   sible for providing a fireguard when carts are serviced.
   1.2. Emergency fills (support required outside the normal servicing hours) are limited to mission
   essential requirements. Organizations requiring emergency fills must coordinate with the Fuels
   Resource Control Center at 226-3119.

2. LOX servicing requirements.
   2.1. LGRF will not service LOX carts with 15 or more gallons, except in extreme mission related cir-
   cumstances.
   2.2. LGRF will not service empty LOX carts with no pressure and that have warmed to ambient tem-
   perature until the cart is purged in accordance with (IAW) TO 42B6-1-1.

    2.3. Issues from LOX carts to aircraft and converters must be annotated on Air Force Technical Order
    (AFTO) Form 134, Aviator Breathing Oxygen Servicing Trailer Log (Liquid/Gaseous), prescribed by
    TO 42B6-1-1, can be ordered/downloaded via www.e-publishing.af.mil, and have all columns under
    the heading “Aircraft” completed. This servicing information is utilized to track/isolate possible
    sources of LOX contamination in the event of an aircraft incident IAW AFI 23-201, paragraph 6.10.5.
    and TO 42B6-1-1, paragraph 2.22.
    2.4. LOX carts with an open red X symbol annotated on the AFTO Form 244, Industrial/ Support
    Equipment Record, prescribed by TO 00-20-7, Inspection System Documentation and Reporting for
    Support and Training Equipment, (form can be ordered/downloaded via www.e-publishing.af.mil)
    will not be serviced until authorized personnel have cleared the red X. Carts determined unsafe for
    operation will not be serviced IAW AFI 23-201, paragraph 6.17.2. and TO 00-20-1, Aerospace Equip-
    ment Maintenance, Inspection, Documentation, Policies, and Procedures, paragraph 4.2.
    2.5. Due to the high evaporation rate, low use carts affect both quality control and violate the cryo-
    genic conservation program. Low use carts will be documented and filled at the discretion of the
    Cryogenics Supervisor. A low use cart is one used to service aircraft on less than 5 of the past 12 cal-
    endar days. Using organizations are encouraged to keep active carts to a minimum and place others in
    a purged standby status. Cryogenics personnel will monitor and track low use carts. If the using orga-
    nization shows a trend, the Electrical Environmental Element will determine if carts will be placed in
    purged standby status.
