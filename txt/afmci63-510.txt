This instruction prescribes AFMC policy and procedures to implement TO 00-35D-54 USAF Deficiency
Reporting, Investigation, and Resolution. It is consistent with the objectives of Air Force Policy Directive
(AFPD) 63-5, Quality Assurance, Air Force Instruction (AFI) 63-501, Air Force Acquisition Quality Pro-
gram and AFI 99-103, Capabilities Based Test and Evaluation. This instruction provides policy relating
to implementing deficiency resolution and creates the management framework for application of systems
engineering processes. It is to be used by all AFMC organizations and its contractors to provide war-win-
ning capabilities; on time, on cost.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document substantially revises AFMCI 63-510 and requires a complete review. This revision
changes the title to Deficiency Reporting, Investigation and Resolution to emphasize the intent of resolu-
tion in addition to reporting and investigation. This revision updates the role of the deficiency reporting,
investigation and resolution program in implementing acquisition quality assurance programs. It adds the
requirement that contracts include provisions making the government-based process the primary method
of reporting and tracking deficiencies. It also adds AFMC responsibilities for training development and
oversight.


1. General: Deficiency reporting, investigating, and resolution processes promote the ability to identify
and correct deficiencies before they impact mission capability. Successful implementation drives resolu-
tion decisions, tempered by total ownership cost, to correct, mitigate, and/or accept risk of conditions
impacting operational safety, suitability and effectiveness (OSS&E). Success is based upon two pre-
mises: 1) that the user/operator/maintainer reports deficiencies on their assigned systems and 2) that the
program manager (PM) establishes a proactive process to analyze data and act accordingly to implement
solutions. Specific objectives include:
2                                                                          AFMCI63-510 2 MAY 2006


    1.1. Identify and resolve Test and Evaluation (T&E), Product Quality, and Materiel deficiencies
    throughout a product or system lifecycle.
    1.2. Commence deficiency reporting and resolution as early as possible during systems acquisition
    and throughout government T&E so systems improve faster with the least cost.
    1.3. Integrate deficiency analysis and resolution processes within quality, systems engineering, and
    overall Life Cycle Management Plans (LCMP) to identify root cause and prevent or mitigate recur-
    rence.
    1.4. Obtain cost credit and/or contractual remedy, if available, for procurement related quality defi-
    ciencies resulting from poor workmanship and nonconformance to applicable specifications, draw-
    ings, standards, processes or other technical requirements.
    1.5. Provide historical collection of deficiency data to share knowledge with authorized activities
    responsible for design, development, safety, purchasing, production, supply, operations, maintenance,
    contract administration, and other functions.

2. Policy. Complete and thorough deficiency identification and resolution are crucial to fielding and sus-
taining safe, suitable, and effective weapon and military systems. It is AFMC policy that:
    2.1. Acquisition and sustainment PMs shall use T.O. 00-35D-54, USAF Deficiency Reporting, Inves-
    tigation, and Resolution procedures throughout a system or product life cycle to identify, report, and
    resolve deficiencies and recommended enhancements through correction or acceptance of risk.
    2.2. Information technology tools and associated business rules will be established to standardize pro-
    cesses and facilitate the collection and dissemination of deficiency data.
    2.3. Contract clauses or quality assurance provisions will be incorporated into contracts, including
    those for contractor logistics support (CLS) and total system performance responsibility (TSPR), to
    require the government-based deficiency reporting, investigating, and resolution process is the pri-
    mary method of reporting and tracking deficiencies.

Terms
Category I Deficiencyâ€”Category I deficiencies are those which may cause death, severe injury, or
severe occupational illness; may cause loss or major damage to a weapon system; critically restricts the
combat readiness capabilities of the using organization; or which would result in a production line
stoppage.
Category II Deficiencyâ€”Category II deficiencies are those that impede or constrain successful mission
accomplishment (system does not meet minimum operational requirements but does not meet the safety
or mission impact criteria of a Category I deficiency). It may also be a condition that complements, but is
not absolutely required for, successful mission accomplishment. The recommended enhancement, if
incorporated, will improve a systemâ€™s operational effectiveness or suitability.
Chief Engineerâ€”The individual responsible for all system technical activities, including engineering
and configuration changes, in support of the Program Manager.
Contractor Logistics Supportâ€”A planned cost effective contract support method used to provide all or
part of the logistics support elements for a system, equipment, or item for extended periods of time or for
the life of the system or equipment.
Deficiency Reportâ€”The generic term used within the USAF to record, submit and transmit deficiency
data which may include, but is not limited to a Deficiency Report involving quality, materiel, software, or
warranty deficiency data submitted using the Standard Form 368 or equivalent format.
End Itemâ€”Equipment that can be used by itself to perform a military function.
Exhibitâ€”The item reported as being deficient, or a sample item which represents the reported deficient
condition, which can be analyzed to determine the possible cause of the defect.
Lead Engineerâ€”The individual responsible for all end-item technical activities, including engineering
and configuration changes in support of the end-item PM.
Materiel Deficiencyâ€”An unacceptable condition or recommendation for an enhancement that impacts

the operational safety, suitability, and/or effectiveness of a system, subsystem or component. It does not
include deficiencies related to workmanship or non-conformance of processes. (See Product Quality
Deficiency)
Maintenance Engineering (ME)â€”ME is defined as the engineering effort required to review, assess,
define and resolve technical or supportability deficiencies revealed in operational service. ME does not
address execution and implementation of system modifications or upgrades (efforts that change form, fit,
function, or interface of a component or system) as these efforts are primarily intended to increase system
capability/performance. The focus of ME is to resolve an existing operational deficiency, either technical
or supportability, and not as a vehicle to incorporate new capabilities.
Operational Effectivenessâ€”The overall degree of mission accomplishment of a system or end-item
used by representative personnel in the environment planned or expected for operational employment of
the system or end-item considering organization, doctrine, tactics, information assurance, force
protection, survivability, vulnerability, and threat.
Operational Safetyâ€”The condition of having acceptable risk to life, health, property, and environment
caused by a system or end-item when employing that system or end-item in an operational environment.
This requires the identification of hazards, assessment of risk, determination of mitigating measures, and
acceptance of residual risk.
Operational Suitabilityâ€”The degree to which a system or end-item can be placed satisfactorily in field
use, with consideration given to availability, compatibility, transportability, interoperability, reliability,
wartime use rates, maintainability, full-dimension protection, operational safety, human factors,
architectural and infrastructure compliance, manpower supportability, logistics supportability, natural
environmental effects and impacts, and documentation and training requirements.
Operational Safety, Suitability and Effectiveness (OSS&E)â€”A p r o c e s s f o r e s t a b l i s h i n g a n d
preserving the safety, suitability, and effectiveness of Air Force systems and end-items over their entire
operational life by preserving technical integrity via prudent use of disciplined engineering practices,
assurance of proper operation and maintenance, effective supply systems, and field utilization and
maintenance trends feedback to system program offices.
Product Quality Deficiencyâ€”A deficiency detected on new or newly reworked government-owned
products that do not fulfill their expected purpose, operation, or service due to deficiencies in design,
specification, materiel, software, manufacturing process, and/or workmanship. This includes the initial
failure of the item after installation or placement in service, as well as pre-mature failure within an
identified warranty period or specified period of performance.
Product Quality Deficiency Report (PQDR)â€”A report of deficiency detected on new or newly
reworked government-owned products that do not fulfill their expected purpose, operation, or service due
to deficiencies in design, specification, materiel, software, manufacturing process, and/or workmanship.
This includes the initial failure of the item after installation or placement in service, as well as pre-mature
failure within an identified warranty period or specified period of performance.
Program Manager (PM)â€”PMs are responsible to their customers for all aspects of the planning,
development, sustainment, and evolution of the products they acquire and support. PMs serve as the
single-face-to-the-user for their respective systems or products. PMs are responsible for program
performance and overall health of the product. The PM is the System Program Director (SPD) or Product
Group Manager (PGM) for their system or product line. Some PM functions are delegated to System
Support Managers (SSMs), Supply Chain Managers (SCMs), and Development System Managers

(DSMs).
Service Level Agreement (SLA)â€”Bilateral agreements between the customer and their suppliers. Their
purpose is to establish a framework of expectations between both parties regarding service levels as
measured in terms of quantity, quality, and timeliness. SLAâ€™s apply only to organically supported
functions.
Supply Chain Manager (SCM)â€”Designated individual(s) at an Air Logistics Center (ALC) responsible
for managing a line of National Stock Number (NSN)-coded items. SCM functions include requirements
determination; cataloging, standardization and engineering data management; stock control and
distribution; technical management functions; and pricing for their assigned items. SCMs report to ALC
Commanders/Civilian Directors, but are responsible for supplying, repairing, and managing materiel to
support SMs.
Sustaining Engineering (SE)â€”Engineering efforts on systems, products or materials required to resolve
technical or supportability deficiencies revealed in operational service. It includes, but is not limited to,
assessing deficiency indicators defining the characteristics and cause of such deficiencies, determining
the impact on the affected product, identifying and evaluating alternative solutions, and determining the
preferred solution. It excludes support for items managed by the Air Force Working Capital Fund
(AFWCF), software maintenance engineering, CLS-maintained systems, aircraft engine components, and
items managed by the Defense Logistics Agency. SE may be conducted by contractors or by organic
government facilities and personnel. SE by contract includes all associated contractual efforts (e.g.,
engineering and technical data modeling simulation and testing) which are integral to the completion of
the overall engineering task. It excludes orders placed with organic facilities/depots. SE by contract
funds are tracked under Element of Expense Identification Code (EEIC 583). Funds executions for SE by
non-contract organic facilities/depots are tracked under EEIC 590. (Air Force Data Dictionary)
Systems Engineeringâ€”An interdisciplinary approach encompassing the entire set of scientific,
technical, and managerial efforts needed to evolve, verify, deploy, and support an integrated and
life-cycle-balanced set of system solutions that satisfy customer needs.
System Support Manager (SSM)â€”The lead individual at an AFMC organization (e.g., ALC) delegated
sustainment responsibility for a system/product by the SM. SSMs report directly to the PM.
