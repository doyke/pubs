6. Explosive Safety Briefs.
     6.1. A pre-task safety brief will be conducted prior to commencing with any explosive
     operation. Use the Pre-task Safety Brief Checklist (Attachment 2) when conducting the

     Within the same building is not acceptable; the brief must be at the actual location.
     6.2. A visitor’s explosive safety brief will be conducted each time visitors enter an explosive
     area/building or operating location. Use the Visitor’s Safety Brief Checklist (Attachment 3)
     when conducting the brief.
7. Dull Sword Reporting Procedures.
     7.1. The wing WSM will have an Air Force Safety Automated System (AFSAS) account for
     dull sword reporting. The account will be set up to ensure all dull swords reported are sent
     through AFSAS to the WSM via e-mail, for dissemination to the affected 309 MXW
     organization. The account will also allow for reporting dull swords from the 309 MXW.
     7.2. When an incoming dull sword e-mail is received via AFSAS, the WSM shall inform the
     affected shop (i.e., the age overhaul unit) and 309 MXW Chief of Nuclear Integration
     (309 MXW/A-10).
     7.3. 309 MXW/A-10 will notify the group and squadron commander/director of the affected
     group, and also wing leadership. The notification will be accomplished through email to the
     309 MXW workflow.
     7.4. To initiate a dull sword, the units will contact the WSM, who will determine if the
     discrepancy is dull sword reportable.
     7.5. Once it has been determined to be reportable, the unit will provide the necessary
     information and narrative to the WSM. The WSM will input the information into AFSAS,
     and submit the dull sword.
     7.6. The WSM will advise the 309 MXW/A-10 and 309 MXW/SE of the action, and provide
     a copy of the dull sword to them via e-mail.
     7.7. 309 MXW/A-10 will inform wing leadership of all incoming and outgoing dull sword
     reports using 309 MXW workflow channels.
