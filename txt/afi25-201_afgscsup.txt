AFI 25-201, Support Agreements Procedures, 1 May 2005, is supplemented as follows. This
supplement provides guidance and procedures for Support Agreement Managers (SAM) at all
levels of the command to negotiate, coordinate and document recurring day-to-day peacetime
support. It applies to all active Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) units. It does not
apply to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and Air National Guard (ANG) units and
members. Send comments and suggested improvements on AF Form 847, Recommendation for
Changes of Publication, through channels to HQ AFGSC/A4RX, 41 Orville Wright Avenue,
Barksdale AFB, LA 71110. Emails for AFGSC/A4RX should be sent to the AFGSC
A4RX/Plans & Integration Workflow (AFGSCA4RXPlans@barksdale.af.mil).
Ensure all official records (files, logs, tracking tools, coordination tracking sheets, database
input/output, completed forms, appointment letters, memoranda of agreement/understanding
(MOA/MOU), memos for record, e-mails, annual reviews, rosters, lists, user-developed catalogs,
documented changes to agreements and other documents) created as a result of processes
prescribed herein are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records,
and dispose of them according to the AF Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at the AF
Portal link for the AF Records Information Management System (AFRIMS). Contact supporting
records managers as required. If a record is maintained outside the official files, its location will
be indicated on the file plan and a disposition control label will be affixed to the record media,
e.g. continuity binder, etc. (See Attachment 10 (Added) for records management support
provided by AFGSC hosts and requested by AFGSC tenants.)
1.2.2.1. (Added) Command to Command MOA/MOUs will be coordinated through
AFGSC/A4RX to ensure proper format and procedures.
2                                                      AFI 25-201_AFGSCSUP 1 MAY 2010



1.2.3.1. (Added) The SAM is not responsible for developing or coordinating functional area
MOA/MOUs. They may provide general format guidance, if requested.
1.4.1. Support to DoD Contractors. When the host command furnishes on-base contractor
logistical support under a tenant-funded contract, the command that must accomplish the
contract will reimburse or refund the host base using the same funds cited in the basic contract.
Do not allow the funding command to make the reimbursement through the contractor. See AFI
65-601, Vol I, Budget Guidance and Procedures, para 7.8.9, for additional guidance.
1.4.1.1. (Added) Where a particular function is contracted out (i.e., Materiel Management,
Transportation), the SAM forwards requirements to the local contracting office, then the local
contracting officer or Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE) sends requirements to the contractor
for coordination.
2.1.1.1. Headquarters AFGSC Plans and Integration Branch (AFGSC/A4RX) is the command
program manager for the AFGSC Support Agreements Program.
2.1.1.2.1. (Added) The approval authority is the person authorized to commit resources, which is
normally the Wing Commander or their delegated official. When this authority is delegated, it
must be in writing to include the full name/rank, office symbol, and the contact number.
Normally, it rests with the O-6 within the chain of command where the agreements are located.
Appointment cannot be designated to a position. The installation SAM must maintain a copy of
the delegation on file. An appointment letter is not required when the approval authority is the
Wing Commander.
2.1.1.2.2. (Added) Geographically Separated Units (GSUs), i.e., detachments, flights, squadrons,
etc., can prepare and negotiate their support agreements if a SAM is appointed IAW para 2.2.1.1.
or para 2.3.1.2. as applicable. The GSU Commander signs in Block 11, DD Form 1144 and
forwards the agreement to its parent wing or unit commander to be included in the wing’s
agreement database.
2.1.1.6. (Added) Maintain a copy of all AFGSC agreements (DD Form 1144).
2.1.1.7. (Added) Provides Staff Assistance Visits when requested.

AFGSC/A4RX to resolve Support Agreement-related manpower issues.
2.1.4. Civil Engineer. HQ AFGSC CE Operations Division (AFGSC/A7O) will assist
AFGSC/A4RX to resolve Support Agreement-related civil engineer issues.
2.1.5. Security Forces. HQ AFGSC Security Forces Division (AFGSC/A7S) will assist
AFGSC/A4RX to resolve Support Agreement-related security issues.
2.1.6. Other Functional Managers. HQ AFGSC Civil Law Division (AFGSC/JAC) will assist
AFGSC/A4RX to resolve Support Agreement-related legal issues.
2.1.7. (Added) All AFGSC staff functional OPRs will establish an agreement Point of Contact
(POC) and notify HQ AFGSC/A4RX in writing of the individual’s name, rank, office symbol,
AFI25-201_AFGSCSUP 1 MAY 2010                                                                 3

and phone number. This individual will be the single POC for all agreement actions within that
directorate that affects their functional area of expertise. A4RX will be notified immediately if
changes occur.
2.2.1.1. Maintains a current SAM appointment letter, signed by the approving authority, on file
and ensures HQ AFGSC/A4RX is sent an updated letter annually or upon appointment,
whichever is sooner.
2.2.1.2.1. (Added) Develops/maintains a Standard Level of Support catalog for the Installation
(ISSC).
2.2.1.2.2. (Added) Annually reviews the Installation organization (suggest using the base phone
book or base web site) to ensure support being provided, if any, is documented on a DD Form
1144. Organizations that are documented as small-scale support IAW AFI 25-201, para 3.2.1.6.,
must be reviewed at this time to ensure scope of support has not increased. Document this review
with a simple Memorandum for Record (MFR).
2.2.1.2.3. (Added) Provides a quarterly report of all agreements that are “in effect” to HQ
AFGSC/A4RX. This report is due by the 10th day of October, January, April, and July.
2.2.1.2.4. (Added) Ensures agreements that remain in effect in mobilization or other emergency,
are referenced in Part One of the installation In-garrison Expeditionary Site Plan (IGESP), as
applicable, IAW AFI 10-404, Base Support and Expeditionary Site Planning, Attachment 24.
2.2.1.4. Maintains a file of specific provisions with applicable direct incremental reimbursable
costs, as identified IAW AFI 25-201, para 2.2.1.4.
2.2.1.5. Maintains a coordination log for tracking agreements (suggested format is at
Attachment 11 (Added)). If suspense dates are missed, maintain documentation (email or MFR)
in the agreement folder.
2.2.1.10. As a minimum, the continuity folder should consist of: DoDI 4000.19, Interservice and
Intragovernmental Support; AFPD 25-2, Support Agreements; AFI 25-201, Support Agreement
Procedures; AFI 25-201_AFGSC SUP, Support Agreement Procedures; AFGSC Interim
Policies, C&SRL Logistics Plans Programs Support Agreements Management, Current Status of
Agreements Roster, Consolidated FAAC List, and a Training Log.
2.2.1.11. (Added) Maintains a six-part folder for each agreement. The folder will be arranged as
follows:
       Part 1. (Inside front cover): POCs for agreement and/or coordination log
       Part 2. Current signed Agreement (or in-work, if initial)
       Part 3. Communication records (if any) i.e. follow-up e-mails/memorandums
       Part 4. In-work correspondence (i.e. revisions requested)
       Part 5. Previous Agreement/Significant Historical documents
       Part 6. (Inside back cover) Annual Budget Review
2.3.1.4. (Added) Ensures the status and effective date are current within SAMS. If the agreement
was not generated using SAMS, manually enter Blocks 1 - 9. In Block 7a, only annotate the
4                                                      AFI 25-201_AFGSCSUP 1 MAY 2010

reimbursement/non-reimbursement amounts. For all agreements “in effect”, enter “//SIGNED//”
in Block 8(4).
2.4.1.10. Functional OPRs should inform the SAM when an instruction/directive is changed that
affects the agreement. If required, the agreement should be revised or re-accomplished.
3.2.1. Agreements between AFGSC units, including AFGSC Headquarters and GSUs, are not
required unless requested by the Supplying and/or Receiving Commander.
3.2.1.6. Documentation should include the receiver’s organizational information (name, location,
and command), POC, description of support being provided, and costs associated with the
support. Both receiver and supplier approving authorities should sign document.
3.3.3. When there appears to be a duplication of effort, the AFGSC supplier discusses the
requirement for a waiver with the receiver and documents discussion and results, and notifies the
installation SAM, HQ AFGSC functional OPR, and A4RX. The Receiver follows procedures in
AFI 25-201, para 3.3.3. to obtain a waiver and provides the Supplying SAM a copy of the
request to attach to the agreement. If approved by HQ USAF Plans and Integration Division
(USAF/A4LX), the request is replaced with the approved waiver and a copy of the waiver is
provided to HQ AFGSC/A4RX.
4.4.5. Approval of the support agreement will not be delayed awaiting actual transfer of
manpower authorizations. However, it is recommended to advise the Receiver that services may
be delayed until manpower is actually obtained and available to the Supplier, if applicable.
5.1.3. (Added) The use of SAMS is not mandatory within AFGSC.
5.2.1.1. Coordination through FAACS (other than those listed in AFI 25-201, para 5.2.1.2.) is not
necessary if standard support from a current ISSC is requested in the support agreement and
there are no reimbursements to validate.
5.2.1.2.1. (Added) When facilities are involved, the SAM should also coordinate the agreement
with the Civil Engineer office to ensure all civil engineering and real estate concerns are
addressed in the support agreement.
5.2.1.2.2. (Added) When RM support is required, ensure coordination between host and tenant
RM offices is accomplished.
5.2.1.4. (Added) The SAM should set timelines for agreements in the coordination process. The
initial/re-accomplished agreement is forwarded to the FAACs normally with a two-week
suspense for reply. Follow-up should be initiated at the end of the two weeks. If required, a
second follow-up is submitted. No response after the 2nd follow-up, the SAM should consider
documenting the coordination efforts and attach to Part 3 of the agreement folder.
5.4.1.3. The Installation SAM updates changes resulting from any budget reviews. Work directly
with the FAAC when there is a question of reimbursements or lack of reimbursements as
identified in the FAAC specific provisions on file, per para 2.2.1.4.
5.4.2.1. Triennial reviews are not required for AF to Non-AF agreements, as these agreements
are governed by DoDI 4000.19. However, annual financial reviews are still required to ensure
Air Force resources are captured and reimbursed.
AFI25-201_AFGSCSUP 1 MAY 2010                                                                 5

5.4.2.2. (Added) When AFGSC is the receiver and the supplier has not initiated review within
90 days from the 3-year anniversary of the effective date, it will then become the responsibility
of the AFGSC Receiver to initiate a request to the Supplier for a triennial review. Document the
contact that was initiated and attach to Part 3 of the agreement folder. If necessary, request
assistance from AFGSC/A4RX.
5.4.3. Minor Revisions. Minor pen and ink changes agreed to between the Supplier and/or
Receiver SAM must be documented and maintained in Part 4 of the agreement folder. All pen
and ink changes must be incorporated in the next review/revision.
5.5.1.1. SAMs should notify AFGSC/A4RX when an impasse cannot be resolved within 120
days. Signature of an agreement should not be withheld due to an impasse. Follow AFI 25-201,
para 5.5.1.2. for impasse procedures.

A6.3. The Army Veterinary Service is not considered a tenant; therefore, a Support Agreement
(DD Form 1144) is not required for common services, which are the same services provided to
non-tenant units. A wing-level MOA should be established specifying the services/support
provided to the host and the veterinary unit. The MOA should follow the format in AFI 25-201,
Attachment 4.
A6.7. (Added) Document Automation and Production Services (DAPS). The current Support
Agreement between HQ Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and HQ USAF (ILC) is that, “DAPS
will be a tenant and occupy AF real estate and facilities and receive normal base tenancy and
services.” This is reimbursable support, if applicable.
