This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 48-1, Aerospace Medicine
Enterprise, Air Force Pamphlet (AFPAM) 48-151, Thermal Injury and provides guidance on the
prevention of heat and cold stress related injuries. This instruction applies to all Whiteman Air
Force Base (AFB) commanders, non-bargaining unit supervisors, and non-bargaining unit
personnel engaged in or responsible for activities where thermal stress is of concern. Bargaining
unit personnel will follow procedures as outlined in Labor Management Agreements. Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication.
Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are
maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records
and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Information Management System
(AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
af61a/afrims/afrims/.

2                                               WHITEMANAFBI48-103 19 MARCH 2014


    2.1. 509th Operations Support Squadron Weather Flight (509 OSS/OSW), 687-3061 will
    contact 509th Medical Operations Squadron Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight (509
    MDOS/SGOJ) from March through May and 15 September through 30 November, when the
    ambient temperature could potentially reach 85° F, at which time 509 MDOS/SGOJ will start
    Web Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) monitoring.
    2.2. 509 MDOS/SGOJ, 687-4324 shall:
       2.2.1. Ensure heat stress guidance is available to shop personnel through Air Force
       Occupational Safety and Health (AFOSH) inspections at the shop level.
       2.2.2. Set up and monitor the WBGT instrument daily from 1 June to 15 September.
       2.2.3. Set up and monitor the WBGT instrument March through May and 15 September
       through 30 November when ambient temperature reaches 85° F.
       2.2.4. Report the WBGT to the 509th Bomb Wing Command Post (509 BW/CP) during
       normal duty hours, Monday through Friday from 0730 – 1630, every 2 hours. Readings
       may be reported hourly when the WBGT reads 95° F. A final reading will be reported to
       509 BW/CP at 1600 each duty day that monitoring is required and will expire at 1800 the
       same day.
       2.2.5. Update          WBGT           on the      base      SharePoint    site,
       https://whiteman.eis.af.mil/int/WBGT/default.aspx, concurrently with reporting
       instructions listed in paragraph 2.2.4.
       2.2.6. WBGT monitoring will not typically be provided by 509 MDOS/SGOJ on
       weekends or other non-duty days. The number of units and personnel performing
       outdoor work meeting the moderate and hard work criteria as noted in Attachment 2 is
       expected to greatly diminish during these timeframes. If a unit anticipates moderate or
       hard outdoor workload on a weekend or other non-duty day and would like assistance
       with heat stress guidance, they can contact the Bioenvironmental technician on-call
       through 509 BW/CP.
    2.3. 509 BW/CP, 687-3778 shall:
       2.3.1. Relay the WBGT to 509th Bomb Wing (509 BW) squadron commanders through
       the radio net.
       2.3.2. Contact the 442d Fighter Wing Command Post (442 FW/CP), 687-3564 with the
       WBGT.
    2.4. 442 FW/CP, 687-3564 will relay the WBGT to 442d Maintenance Operations Flight
    Maintenance Operations Center, 687-1250; 303d Fighter Squadron, 687-2741 and squadron
    commanders through the applicable radio net.
    2.5. Squadron commanders shall:
       2.5.1. Ensure that heat stress programs are implemented throughout their organizations.
       2.5.2. Relay the WBGT to their respective squadrons down to the shop supervisors.
    2.6. Shop supervisors shall:
       2.6.1. Implement heat stress guidance at the shop level per Attachment 2.
WHITEMANAFBI48-103 19 MARCH 2014                                                             3


      2.6.2. Brief personnel during late spring and summer months on heat stress in safety
      meetings and follow the guidance provided.
3. Cold Stress Responsibilities and Procedures.
   3.1. 509 MDOS/SGOJ shall:
      3.1.1. Obtain outside ground temperature and wind speed from 509 OSS/OSW or the
      509                      OSS/OSW                         JET               Server
      (https://owsjet26.us.af.mil/portal/private/GuestWhitemanAFB/Sensor) during normal
      duty hours, Monday through Friday from 0730 – 1630, and determine the wind chill
      temperature and frostbite risk level (FRL) using Table A3.1.
      3.1.2. Notify 509 BW/CP of the resulting FRL.
   3.2. 509 BW/CP shall:
      3.2.1. Obtain outside ground temperature and wind speed from the 509 OSS/OSW JET
      Server (https://owsjet26.us.af.mil/portal/private/GuestWhitemanAFB/Sensor) after
      1630, Mon – Fri, and on weekends and determine the wind chill temperature and frostbite
      risk level (FRL) using Table A3.1.
      3.2.2. Relay FRL information using the base communications networks as needed.
   3.3. 509 BW squadron commanders shall:
      3.3.1. Ensure wind chill guidance is implemented throughout the squadron.
      3.3.2. Relay wind chill information to respective squadrons down to the shop
      supervisors.
   3.4. Shop supervisors shall:
      3.4.1. Ensure workers wear cold protective clothing appropriate for the level of cold and
      physical activity at temperatures below 40° F.
      3.4.2. Ensure gloves are worn or metal handles are covered with an insulating material
      when the ambient temperature is 30° F or less.
      3.4.3. If heavy work is done (shoveling, etc), encourage workers to change into dry
      clothing, prior to re-entering a cold environment or going into a cold environment.
      3.4.4. Ensure workers handling evaporative liquids such as gasoline, alcohol or cleaning
      fluids at temperatures below 40° F take special precautions to avoid soaking clothes or
      gloves due to evaporative cooling of the liquids.
      3.4.5. Implement the buddy system at minus 25° F or when the equivalent wind chill
      temperature is reached.
      3.4.6. Implement personnel protective measures as listed in Table A3.2.
      3.4.7. Brief shop personnel during fall and winter safety meetings on wind chill factors
      and following the guidance provided.
      3.4.8. At temperatures below 36° F, if a worker becomes immersed in water or their
      clothing becomes wet, encourage them to change their clothing immediately and seek
      treatment for hypothermia.
