PART I
Preface
1. This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training document that
   identifies life-cycle education/training requirements, training support resources and minimum core task
   requirements for this specialty. The CFETP will provide personnel a clear career path to success and instill rigor
   in all aspects of career field training.
2. The CFETP consists of two parts; both of which are used by management to plan, manage, and control training
   within the career field.
   2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. Section A explains how
   everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies career progression information, duties and responsibilities,
   training strategies, and career field path; Section C associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge,
   education, training, and other); Section D indicates resource constraints. Some examples are funds, manpower,
   equipment, and facilities. Note: The Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD) and AFI
   36-2101 Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted) contain the specialty descriptions.
   2.2. Part II includes the following: Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes
   duties, tasks, technical references to support training, Air Education and Training Command (AETC) conducted
   training, and correspondence course requirements. Section B contains the course objective list and training
   standards supervisors will use to determine if Airmen satisfy training requirements. Section C identifies
   available training support materials. Section D identifies a training course index that is used to determine
   resources available to support training. Included here are both mandatory and optional courses. Sections E and F
   identify MAJCOM unique training requirements.
   2.3. Attachment 3 to the electronic version of the CFETP is a career path chart. This chart provides a visual
   depiction of the Airborne Operations AFSC, Career Enlisted Flyers Incentive Pay gates and years of aviation
   service, and key information to education, training and qualification. It also contains promotion information
   specific to the Airborne Operations AFSC, such as average time in grade, time in service, as well as Air Force
   averages. This chart provides a timeline for achieving additional qualifications such as instructor, evaluator,
   FTU assignment, and leadership opportunities within the squadron, Group, Wing and MAJCOM and HQ/USAF.
3. This CFETP is designed to ensure individuals in AFSC 1A4XX receive comprehensive and effective training at
   the appropriate phases of their career. At unit level, supervisors and trainers use Part II to identify, plan, and
   conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.

Section A - General Information

1. Purpose.
 This CFETP provides information necessary for the Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM), MAJCOM
 functional managers (MFMs), commanders, training managers, supervisors, and trainers to plan, develop, manage,
 and conduct an effective and efficient career field training program. The plan outlines the training that individuals
 must receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career. For the purpose of this plan, training is
 divided into four areas: initial skills, upgrade training (UGT), qualification training (QT), and continuation training
 (CT). Initial skills training is the Air Force Specialty specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air
 Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level. Upgrade training identifies the mandatory
 courses, task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion required for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-,
 and 9- skill levels. Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an airman
 in a specific duty position. This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process. It is
 designed to provide the performance skills/knowledge training required for the job. Continuation training is
 additional training either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training provided to
 personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required. The CFETP has several purposes,
 some are:
 1.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program.
 1.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements and recommends education and training for each skill level
 and phase of an individual’s career in this AFS.
 1.3. Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training medium.
 1.4. Identifies major resource constraints that impact full implementation of the desired career field training
 program.

2. Uses.
 The plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training
 programs are available and/or instituted for each individual in the specialty.
 2.1. AETC training personnel will develop and revise formal resident, non-resident, field and exportable training
 based on requirements established by the user and documented in Part II of the CFETP. They will also work with
 the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training.
 2.2. MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial and upgrade skills
 requirements. OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable courses can satisfy identified requirements.
 MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFSC must be identified for inclusion in this plan and must not
 duplicate available training resources.
 2.3. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan. The list of courses in
 Part II will be used as a reference to support training.
 2.4. Personnel in AFSCs 1AXXX or 1U0X1 are exempt from maintaining OJT Training Folders (AF Form 623).
 All training is certified via AF Form 8 by trained flight examiners. Certification on the Form 8 eliminates the
 requirement to document STS items in this CFETP.

3. Coordination and Approval.
 The AFCFM is the approval authority. MAJCOM functional managers and AETC training managers will identify
 and coordinate on the career field training requirements. The AFCFM will initiate an annual review of this
 document and coordinate with AETC and MFMs to ensure currency and accuracy. Using the list of courses in Part
 II, they will eliminate duplicate training. Send applicable inputs/changes to this CFETP through MAJCOM
 functional managers to HQ USAF/A3O-AM, 1480 Air Force Pentagon, Washington D.C. 20330-1480 or the
 following organizational email address: afa3oam.workflow@pentagon.af.mil.

5. Skill/Career Progression.
 Adequate training and timely progression from the apprentice to the superintendent skill level plays an extremely
 important role in the Air Force’s ability to accomplish its mission. Therefore, it is essential that everyone involved
 in training do their part to plan, develop, manage, conduct and evaluate an effective and efficient training program.
 The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP will ensure individuals receive viable training at the appropriate
 points in their career. AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted) and Air Force Enlisted
 Classification Directory (AFECD) identify mandatory requirements for the specialty description. The following
 narrative and the AFSC 1A4XX career field flow charts identify the training career path. They define the training
 required in an individual’s career.

6. Training Decisions.
 The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass the entire spectrum of training
 requirements for the Airborne Operations specialty. This CFETP was developed to include life-cycle (day one
 through retirement) training requirements for this specialty. The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and
 how to meet the training requirements. The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of
 training and eliminate a disjointed approach to training.

1. Implementation.
 This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC for classes beginning January 2013.

2. Purpose.
 As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, this STS:
 2.1. Lists in column 1 of attachment 2, the tasks, knowledge, and technical references (TR) necessary for airmen to
 perform in the 3- and 5-skill level AFSC in the Airborne Operations ladder of the Aircrew Operations Career Field.
 2.2. Column 2 (3-Skill Level) shows formal training and correspondence course requirements as described in the
 Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA) web site at: https://etca.randolph.af.mil/ and the career
 knowledge provided by the correspondence course. There are no CDCs listed for this AFSC.
 2.3. Qualitative Requirements. Attachment 1 contains the proficiency code key used to indicate the level of
 training and knowledge provided by resident training and career development courses.
 2.4. Becomes a job qualification standard (JQS) for on-the-job training and used according to AFI 36-2201, Air
 Force Training Program. For OJT, the tasks in column 1 are trained and qualified to the go/no go level. Go means
 the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets local requirements for accuracy, timeliness, and
 correct use of procedures.
 2.5. Is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airmen Promotion System (WAPS).
 Senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields develop the Specialty Knowledge Tests
 (SKTs) at the USAF Occupational Measurement Squadron. The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter
 areas judged by test development team members to be most appropriate for promotion to higher grades. Individual
 responsibilities are in AFI 36-2606, Reenlistment in the United States Air Force.

3. Recommendations.
  Report unsatisfactory performance of individual course graduates to 37 TRG/DOS, 1220 Truemper Street, Suite 1,
 Lackland AFB TX 78236-5568. Please reference specific STS paragraphs.

Section B - Course Objective List

4. Measurement.
 Each objective is indicated as follows: W indicates task or subject knowledge which is measured using a written test,
 PC indicates required task performance which is measured with a performance progress check, and PC/W indicates
 separate measurement of both knowledge and performance elements using a written test and a performance progress
 check.

5. Standard.
 The standard is 85 percent on written examinations. Standards for performance measurement are indicated in the
 objective and delineated on the individual progress checklist. Instructor assistance is provided as needed during the
 progress check, and students may be required to repeat all or part of the behavior until satisfactory performance is
 attained.

6. Proficiency Level.
 Most task performance is taught to the “1a” proficiency level which means the students can do simple parts of the
 task, but needs to be told or shown how to do most of the task (extremely limited) or to a “2b” proficiency level
 which means the students can do most parts of the task, but does need assistance on the hardest parts of the task
 (partially proficient). The student can also determine step-by-step procedures for doing the task.

7. Advanced Skills Course.
 NOTE: There is currently no advanced course. This area is reserved.

Section C - Support Material

8. Support Materials.
 NOTE: There are currently no support material requirements. This area is reserved.

Section D - Training Course Index
