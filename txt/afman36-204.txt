This publication establishes Air Force guidance concerning recruitment and placement for appropriated
fund positions overseas, and the rotation and return placement of U.S. appropriated fund civilian employ-
ees from positions in foreign and non-foreign overseas areas as defined in this manual. This manual also

Force in overseas areas. This manual applies to all Major Commands (MAJCOMs), Air National Guard

                                                  Chapter 1

                                                 GENERAL

1.1. General Information
    1.1.1. This manual supersedes AF Supplement to FPM 301 and supplements DoD Directive (DoDD)
    1400.6, DoD Civilian Employees in Overseas Areas; DoD 1400.25-M, Chapter 1200 , Rotation of
    Employees from Foreign Areas; DoD Priority Placement Program Operations Manual; DoD Instruc-
    tion (DoDI) 1404.12, Employment of Spouses of Active Duty Military Members Stationed Worldwide;
    DoDI 1400.23, Employment of Family Members of Active Duty Military Members and Civilian
    Employees Stationed in Foreign Areas, Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 36-2, Employment and
    Affirmative Action, and AF Manual 36-203, Staffing Civilian Positions.
    1.1.2. Individuals selected for overseas assignments shall be considered solely on the basis of merit
    factors without regard to lawful political affiliation or non-affiliation, religion, labor organization
    affiliation or non-affiliation, marital status, race, color, sex, national origin, non-disqualifying disabil-
    ity, sexual orientation, status as a parent, age or other non-merit factors; and selection must be based
    solely on job-related criteria according to legitimate position requirements. Exclusionary policies of
    the country to which an employee is assigned are not a factor in the selection process.

1.2. Coverage.
    1.2.1. Chapter 11 applies to non-U.S. citizens. Other Chapters of this manual apply to U.S. citizen
    employees.
    1.2.2. DoD 1400.25-M, Subchapter 1231, Employment of Foreign Nationals and Civil Service Rule
    VIII, Section 8.3 covers locally hired non-U.S. citizens. When permitted by U.S. and host country
    treaty or agreement, laws and management considerations, the Air Force shall pattern its employment
    conditions for locally hired non-U.S. citizen employees after the customs and practices of the area.
    Compensation for such employees is based upon local prevailing rates of pay.

1.3. Civilian Staffing.
    1.3.1. When using civilian workers in foreign overseas areas, each Commander shall employ a civil-
    ian manpower mix of U.S. citizens and local nationals that provides the best financial value to the
    government, ensures conformance with host country international agreements or treaties, considers
    the availability of qualified local national personnel, and maximizes career opportunities for U.S. cit-
    izens. When it is advantageous to employ civilians in foreign overseas areas, maximum use is made of
    U.S. and non-U.S. citizens available locally. Unless precluded by treaties or other agreements that
    give preferential treatment to local nationals, family members of military and civilian personnel are
    given preference as provided in DoD Instruction 1400.23, Employment of Family Members of Active
    Duty Military Members and Civilian Employees Stationed in Foreign Areas.
    1.3.2. Civilian Staffing policies, practices, and decisions will comply with Equal Employment Oppor-
    tunity Commission, Merit Systems Protection Board, and Affirmative Employment Program regula-
    tions, principles, and programs.
AFMAN36-204 11 APRIL 2007                                                                                  7


1.4. Adequacy of Facilities and Services. In determining the numbers and types of U.S. civilian
employees for overseas areas, the Commanders shall consider the ability of the command to ensure ade-
quate housing, subsistence, medical, commissary, exchange, laundry, transportation, and other essential
facilities and services. Except when required to meet unexpected emergency conditions, an overseas com-
mand shall not request recruitment from the U.S. unless such facilities are provided. In those overseas
areas where Air Force civilian employees cannot enjoy the facilities and services of the civilian commu-
nity without restriction or where appropriate and adequate facilities do not exist or are not readily avail-
able, the Commander shall allocate facilities and services under his/her jurisdiction. This is done in
accordance with a standard of eligibility that provides available services to both military and civilian per-
sonnel recruited from the U.S.

1.5. Career Development.
   1.5.1. U.S. Air Force encourages its employees in the U.S. and its territories and possessions to accept
   overseas assignments as a part of their career development.
       1.5.1.1. The Department of Defense has an established policy limiting civilian employment in
       foreign areas to five years unless otherwise exempt (See Chapter 2, paragraph 2.5.) or an exten-
       sion (See Chapter 2, paragraph 2.7.) has been approved. It applies to all positions in the compet-
       itive service. This policy allows for the continuous assessment of civilian workforce requirements
       and promotes the efficiency of worldwide operations. It also allows employees in the United
       States the opportunity to accept positions in foreign areas as part of their career development. The
       policy also ensures continuing employment opportunities to newly assigned civilian and military
       family members as current employees and family members rotate out of the area.
       1.5.1.2. The Air Force guidance for foreign and non-foreign (except Hawaii) overseas recruitment
       and rotation provides for the orderly movement of employees to and from overseas areas. It is
       designed to provide expanded career opportunities, broaden experience, provide special skills
       where needed, and to return employees from overseas areas after an agreed period of service.
       Return rights are granted to Air Force career and career-conditional employees who accept assign-
       ment to foreign overseas locations, Alaska, Guam, the Virgin Islands, or the Commonwealth of
       Puerto Rico (Refer to Chapter 7).
   1.5.2. The provisions of AFMAN 36-606, Volume I, Air Force Civilian Career Program Management,
   are followed when processing personnel actions for centrally managed positions.

1.6. Qualifications and Suitability. Since Air Force civilian employees in overseas areas are representa-
tives of the U.S., Air Force uses effective selection techniques to ensure only those persons qualified and
suitable for overseas employment are selected. Prospective employees will receive full and accurate infor-
mation about the overseas area for which they are being considered to include the type of facilities and
services available to them, the nature of the work they will perform, the conditions of their employment,
and their responsibilities to the U.S. as the nation they represent.

1.7. Pay Differentials and Allowances.
   1.7.1. The Air Force recognizes that to obtain and retain the services of DoD civilian employees of
   the caliber required in its overseas areas, it may be necessary to provide pay differentials and allow-
   ances over and above basic pay. Therefore, within the provisions of applicable laws and regulations,
8                                                                         AFMAN36-204 11 APRIL 2007


    Air Force civilian employees serving in overseas areas may be granted differentials and allowances
    appropriate to their duty location and employment conditions.
    1.7.2. Requests from employees assigned overseas who are selected for an assignment in a different
    overseas for additional allowances and differentials, including separate maintenance allowances,
    should be addressed between the losing and gaining CPFs. Decisions to approve or disapprove such
    requests are made by the gaining CPF.

1.8. Employment Eligibility under Status of Forces Agreements (SOFA) or Host Nation Agree-
ments.
    1.8.1. Where applicable, based on the provisions of the SOFA or Host Nation agreements, a person is
    not a part of the civilian component if either a citizen of the host country, or regardless of citizenship,
    “ordinarily resident” in the host country. Those not eligible for the civilian component are only eligi-
    ble for employment as “local labor” under employment conditions established for local national per-
    sonnel (i.e., pay, benefits, etc.). Pay and various other benefits and employment of U.S. citizens must
    comply with U.S. laws, regardless of duty location. In order to comply with both the SOFA and U.S.
    law, the Air Force cannot employ in an appropriated fund position U.S. citizens who are not eligible
    to be a part of the civilian component.
    1.8.2. In determining whether a person is “ordinarily resident” in the host country, the primary con-
    sideration is the situation under which the person initially moved into the host country and the circum-
    stances under which the person remained. CPFs may also seek advice from their local Staff Judge
    Advocate (SJA) or Major Command (MAJCOM).
       1.8.2.1. Individuals who are eligible for employment as family members are not considered “ordi-
       narily resident”.
       1.8.2.2. Individuals who entered the host nation, as members of the U.S. Forces (military, civilian,
       contractor, etc) are not considered “ordinarily resident” as long as they maintain substantially con-
       tinuous employment with the U.S. Forces. (Employment on the local economy will interrupt sub-
       stantially continuous employment.)
    1.8.3. Indicators that a person is “ordinarily resident” include, but are not limited to the following:
       1.8.3.1. Purchase of a residence or entering into a long-term (12 months or more) rental agree-
       ment by the applicant or applicant’s spouse.
       1.8.3.2. Employment on the economy or obtaining a work permit to work on the economy.
       1.8.3.3. Obtaining a resident visa/permit or making a similar declaration that would indicate an
       intent to remain in the foreign area (6 months or more).
       1.8.3.4. Payment of taxes imposed on local residents.
       1.8.3.5. Length of time (normally 12 months) in the host country (other than as a member of the
       U.S. Forces). As a general rule, established residence in the host country is an indicator of the
       intent to stay.
    1.8.4. An eligibility determination is made by AFPC before appointment.

1.9. Employment of Individuals with Dual Citizenship. A person with dual citizenship is, in the eyes
of the U.S. government, first and foremost a U.S. citizen. Accordingly, if otherwise eligible, a person with
AFMAN36-204 11 APRIL 2007                                                                                 9


dual citizenship is employed as a U.S. citizen and provided the maximum benefits possible under laws
and regulations applicable to the employment of U.S. citizens.

1.10. Recruitment and Rotation .
   1.10.1. For foreign and non-foreign (except Hawaii ) overseas recruitment and rotation Air Force
   guidance provides for the orderly movement of employees to and from overseas areas. It is designed
   to provide expanded career opportunities, broaden experience, provide special skills where needed,
   and to return employees from overseas areas after an agreed period of service.
   1.10.2. Employees assigned or appointed in foreign areas with career or career-conditional status
   enter into an agreement with the Air Force to return to the U.S. from the foreign area after completion
   of an initial or subsequent prescribed tour of duty for the area to which assigned. For those positions
   subject to the DoD foreign area limitation policy, this will be no later than five years unless an exten-
   sion is approved. Appointments with a time limitation may not be extended for any period of time that
   would permit retention in foreign areas for a period totaling more than five years without an approved
   tour extension.
   1.10.3. Employees assigned or appointed in foreign areas to an Overseas Limited Appointment (OSL)
   are subject to the five-year foreign area employment limitation DoD policy. IAW 5 CFR 301.201,
   OSL Appointments are rare and used only when there is a severe shortage of candidates.
   1.10.4. An employee may invoke the option to return at any time after completion of a period of ser-
   vice agreed upon under an initial or subsequent tour of duty. Likewise, management may exercise its
   option not to continue the employee after completion of the initial or subsequent tour of duty. The
   employee and management must agree to any management-initiated extension of the overseas tour.
   Requests for extensions of employees in centrally managed positions are subject to Career Field Man-
   ager approval.
   1.10.5. Return placement is effected by exercising return rights, under mobility agreement conditions,
   or by registration in the DoD Priority Placement Program (PPP), as specified in the overseas employ-
   ment agreement. Attachment C provides guidance on PPP registration procedures for nondisplaced
   foreign overseas employees. Employees on Overseas Limited Appointments subject to the five-year
   foreign area employment limitation are terminated at the end of the five-year period unless an exten-
   sion is approved. OSL appointments and extensions are rare and used only when there is a severe
   shortage of candidates.
   1.10.6. Employees recruited for positions in Alaska and Guam are granted return rights, but are not
   subject to the five-year foreign area limitation. However, employees lose their return rights if they
   remain beyond the original five-year assignment, unless the return rights are extended by the former
   base.
   1.10.7. Employees recruited for positions in Hawaii are not granted return rights and they are not sub-
   ject to the five-year foreign area limitation.
   1.10.8. Renewal Agreement Travel (RAT) does not apply for moves to Alaska and Hawaii.

1.11. Pay Retention for Overseas Returnees. Pay retention is authorized for employees, displaced or
nondisplaced, who fulfill their overseas tour obligation, and are reduced in grade or pay band equivalent
upon return to CONUS. This applies to any employee who returns to CONUS, whether through the DoD
Priority Placement Program (PPP), or independent of the PPP. This includes employees who are released
10                                                                     AFMAN36-204 11 APRIL 2007


from the period of service specified in their current transportation agreement due to a management initi-
ated action; employees who have completed more than one year under their current agreement and who
are released from the specified period of service because of compelling personal reasons of a humanitar-
ian or compassionate nature for themselves or immediate family members (such as physical or mental
health or other circumstances over which the employee has no control). Retained pay is set at the lower of
either the rate of basic pay payable to the employee immediately before the reduction in pay; or 150% of
the maximum rate of basic pay payable for the new grade or pay band. Pay retention will not be autho-
rized when an employee is returning from an overseas assignment because of unacceptable performance
(as defined in 5CFR, Part 432) or personal cause (as defined in 5CFR, Part 752).

1.12. Management-Initiated Returns. The Commander of a foreign overseas activity, with the concur-
rence of the servicing MAJCOM/A1C or Air Force Career Field Manager if applicable, may determine an
employee should be returned from the foreign area at any time for reasons other than completion of a pre-
scribed tour of duty. If the employee is serviced by a CPF of a command other than the one to which
assigned, the servicing command will consult with the employee’s parent command prior to any such
determination. The determination is made only for reasons that will justify the return as being in the best
interests of the Air Force. Refer to Chapter 8 for guidance on management-initiated return actions. For
employees recruited from outside of Alaska and Guam for assignment to Alaska and Guam who are on an
overseas employment agreement, the provisions of Chapter 8 apply during the five-year period the return
rights are retained or during the initial five-year period overseas for those without return rights.
AFMAN36-204 11 APRIL 2007                                                                                  11


                                                 Chapter 2

                          FOREIGN AREA EMPLOYMENT LIMITATION

2.1. Information.
   2.1.1. DoD policy limits the period of authorized foreign area employment to a period of five years
   unless otherwise exempt or officially extended. The policy applies to positions in the competitive ser-
   vice and generally does not apply to positions in the excepted service. Refer to paragraph 2.5.1.7. for
   information concerning employees on Veterans Recruitment Appointment (VRA) authority.
   2.1.2. The five-year limitation on foreign area employment provides management the necessary flex-
   ibility to accommodate the ever-changing foreign area workforce requirements and provides
   career-enhancing opportunities for employees based in the U.S. and nonforeign areas. The policy also
   ensures continuing employment opportunities to newly assigned civilian and military family members
   as current employees and family members rotate out of the foreign area.
   2.1.3. The policy does not guarantee any Air Force employee a five-year foreign area assignment. A
   career or career-conditional employee may be required to return from a foreign area consistent with
   the terms of the foreign overseas employment agreement entered into prior to the foreign overseas
   assignment. Management may exercise the option to return any employee, including those on exempt
   positions, when it’s in the best interest of the Air Force. Return may be effected by exercise of return
   rights (if applicable), by registration for priority return placement assistance through the DoD Priority
   Placement Program (PPP) or by mobility agreement.
   2.1.4. The DoD policy limiting foreign overseas employment to 5 years does not apply to family
   members with personal competitive status who accompany a member of the U.S. Armed Forces or
   civilian employee assigned to a foreign overseas area, unless and until loss of dependent status occurs.

2.2. Overseas Limited Appointments.
   2.2.1. The policy of limiting foreign area employment to five consecutive years with the DoD also
   applies to employees hired on overseas limited appointments. IAW 5 CFR 301.201, Overseas Limited
   appointments and extension are rare and only used when there is a severe shortage of candidates.
   When used, such employees are given an appointment not to exceed five years, but initial appointment
   should be for the normal tour of duty for the location. Employment is terminated at the end of the tour
   unless an extension is approved using the same criteria outlined in paragraph 2.7. Career Field Man-
   ager (CFM) approval is required for granting extensions for employees on Overseas Limited Appoint-
   ments in centrally managed positions.
   2.2.2. Employees on Overseas Limited appointments who are exempt from the foreign employment
   limitation are on indefinite appointments. Exemptions are outlined in paragraph 2.5. below.

2.3. Computing Allowable Foreign Employment Period. To compute the period of allowable foreign
area employment remaining under a current appointment, conversion, or on reemployment, all prior civil-
ian appropriated fund employment (temporary, term or permanent) with the DoD in foreign areas not
interrupted by at least 12 months of service or residence in the United States or non-foreign areas (if a res-
ident) must be counted.
12                                                                       AFMAN36-204 11 APRIL 2007


2.4. Employees Who Lose Family Member Status.
     2.4.1. Excepted Appointments - Schedule A. 213.3106(b)(6). A family member (see definition of
     terms) on this appointment who loses family member status through divorce or when the sponsor
     transfers or separates from the service is terminated within two months unless an extension is granted
     in accordance with Chapter 4, paragraph 4.5.2.1.
     2.4.2. Career/Career-Conditional Appointments. A family member on a career or career-conditional
     appointment, who loses family member status through divorce or the sponsor transfers or separates
     from the service, becomes subject to the foreign overseas rotation policy. Refer to paragraph 2.5.1. for
     guidance concerning authorized foreign area employment and paragraph 2.3. for computing the
     allowable period.

2.5. Exemptions from Foreign Area Employment Limitation.
     2.5.1. It is DoD policy to limit civilian employment in foreign areas in competitive service positions
     to five years with these exceptions:
        2.5.1.1. Employees who have been continuously employed in a foreign area prior to 1 April 66.
        2.5.1.2. Employees in positions that are exempt because they require frequent contact with offi-
        cials of the host nation and a detailed current knowledge of the culture, mores, laws, customs or
        government processes of the host nation, which usually are not acquired outside the host nation. A
        position is not placed in this category unless the position description clearly demonstrates how the
        above duties and special knowledge are required on a regular and recurring basis and are critical
        to successful performance. The exemption applies while occupying such a position; however,
        management has the option to require the employee to return to CONUS. See paragraph 2.6. for
        procedures on requesting this exemption.
        2.5.1.3. Employees who are family members accompanying military or civilian employees of the
        DoD components who are stationed in the area.
        2.5.1.4. Employees in the Senior Executive Service (SES).
        2.5.1.5. Educators in the DoD Education Agency (DoDEA) school system.
        2.5.1.6. Employees who were employed before 8 May 89 (USAFE) and 17 Apr 89 (PACAF) in
        positions at the GS-06 level or below or in non-supervisory wage grade positions are exempt as
        long as they stay continuously employed at those grade levels.
        2.5.1.7. Employees serving on a Veterans’ Recruitment Appointment (VRA). VRA employees,
        however, are subject to the five-year limitation immediately upon conversion to a career or
        career-conditional appointment. The intent of this exception is to ensure the VRA appointee has
        enough time to complete two years of excepted service in one, or more than one, VRA appoint-
        ment required for conversion. It is not intended to allow continuation of overseas service through
        a succession of VRA appointments. The employee will sign a rotation agreement that is executed
        prior to effecting a VRA appointment. The employee may be subject to rotation immediately after
        2 years of excepted service and conversion to a position in the competitive service, depending on
        the length of foreign area employment, as computed in accordance with the parameters in para-
        graph 2.3. Upon reaching five years, the employee will be registered in the DoD Priority Place-
        ment Program for return placement immediately upon conversion to career-conditional status.
AFMAN36-204 11 APRIL 2007                                                                              13


      2.5.1.8. Employees of the Air Force Electronic Security Service (now Air Intelligence Agency)
      who were converted from the excepted service to career or career conditional appointments during
      the period 6 Dec 77 through 6 Jun 78 and who have been continuously employed.
   2.5.2. Employees identified in this section who move from exempt to nonexempt positions, become
   subject to the DoD rotation policy and five-year employment limitation. All preceding employment
   with the DoD in a civilian appropriated fund capacity, that is not interrupted by a period of 12 months
   residence in the U.S, is included in computing the five-year period. The period of authorized foreign
   area employment will terminate after a period of time equivalent to one renewal agreement tour of
   duty, beginning with the date of change, or after a total of five years overseas service including the
   service immediately prior to the assignment, whichever is later.

2.6. Position Exemption Guidance.
   2.6.1. Paragraph 2.5.1.2. exempts rotation from overseas areas of those employees assigned to posi-
   tions that require frequent contact with government officials of the host nation as well as a detailed
   current knowledge of the culture, mores, laws, customs or government processes that cannot be
   acquired outside of the host nation. Special recruitment efforts are normally necessary because of the
   unique demands of these positions.
   2.6.2. Identifying positions under this exemption is normally appropriate only when the position is
   vacant. If, however, new duties and responsibilities are added to an encumbered position, and the
   position is approved for exemption from rotation, then the incumbent must be advised of the impact
   on the obligation to return as agreed to in the original overseas employment agreement.
   2.6.3. Requests to exempt positions from the foreign area employment limitation are based on an offi-
   cial position description (PD), core personnel document (CPD) or Statement of Duties and Experience
   (SDE) that clearly shows:
      2.6.3.1. The requirement for a detailed current knowledge of the culture, mores, laws, customs, or
      government processes of the host nation that usually cannot be acquired outside the host nation.
      Duties, performance standards, and evaluation factors must clearly reflect the requirement for
      these knowledges in accomplishing the work of the position on a regular and recurring basis.
      2.6.3.2. The context in which such detailed current knowledge and contact with host nation offi-
      cials is critical for successful performance of the duties in the PD, CPD or SDE. This requires a
      clear explanation of the nature and purpose of the contacts.
      2.6.3.3. The approximate frequency of such contacts.
   2.6.4. Procedures for Requesting an Exemption - Centrally Managed Positions.
      2.6.4.1. When an exemption is proposed and a basis exists to request the exemption, the servicing
      CPF will forward a copy of the position description with a letter recommending the exemption to
      the MAJCOM.
      2.6.4.2. The MAJCOM/A1 will process the exemption package by coordinating it with the MAJ-
      COM functional expert. Upon MAJCOM approval, the package is forwarded to the appropriate
      Career Field Management Team (CFMT) Chief.
      2.6.4.3. The CFMT Chief will endorse the proposal through HQ USAF/A1XC to the Career Field
      Functional Manager (FM) for final decision.
14                                                                        AFMAN36-204 11 APRIL 2007


     2.6.5. Procedures for Requesting an Exemption - Non-Centrally Managed Positions.
        2.6.5.1. When an exemption is proposed and a basis exists to request the exemption, the servicing
        CPF will forward a copy of the position description with a letter recommending the exemption to
        the MAJCOM.
        2.6.5.2. The MAJCOM DPC processes the exemption package by coordinating it with the MAJ-
        COM functional expert. If the functional expert recommends approval of the position for the
        exemption, the entire package will be forwarded to HQ USAF/A1XC for a compliance review.
        HQ USAF/A1X will make the final determination.

2.7. Requests for Extensions
     2.7.1. The DoD rotation policy limits civilian employment in foreign areas to five years for those
     employees in competitive service appointments. Employees serving in foreign areas whose employ-
     ment is limited by the DoD rotation policy may be extended as authorized under the conditions iden-
     tified in this section.
        2.7.1.1. Extensions of foreign area tours beyond five years are designed to enable management to
        meet defined mission requirements that cannot otherwise be met due to unavailability of suitable
        candidates. Extensions are never intended to allow employees to stay in the foreign area for indef-
        inite periods of time. Employees do not have an inherent right to such extensions.
        2.7.1.2. The five-year overseas employment limitation policy does not guarantee any Air Force
        employee a five-year assignment overseas. Management does not have to extend an employee
        beyond the initial tour of duty and does not have to justify reasons for disapproving the extension.
        Accordingly, both the employee and management must agree to any extension of overseas service.
        2.7.1.3. Extensions are granted on a case-by-case-basis. Normally there will only be a single
        extension beyond the five-year limitation. Extensions may be granted only if the employee has an
        acceptable performance rating, is current in the knowledge, skills, and abilities required for the
        position and has adapted successfully to the foreign working and cultural environment.
     2.7.2. Approval authorities for extension requests are as follows:
        2.7.2.1. Short-term extensions – Centrally Managed and Non-Centrally Managed Positions.
        Employees may request a short-term extension of six months or less beyond the initial five-year
        foreign area limitation for such extenuating reasons as to allow children to complete the current
        school year or to reach retirement eligibility date (if the employee intends to retire at that time).
        For non-centrally managed positions, the Civilian Personnel Officer has the authority to extend
        the foreign overseas tour up to six months immediately following the initial five years when
        appropriate. The CPF can approve a six-month extension of incumbents of centrally managed
        positions with coordination through the applicable Career Field Management Team (CFMT). Such
        extensions do not automatically continue the position obligation (return rights) beyond the
        five-year date; therefore, the overseas CPF notifies the stateside CPF when short-term extensions
        have been granted.
        2.7.2.2. Long-term extensions (greater than 6 months) – Centrally Managed Positions. The
        respective career field manager at Headquarters Air Force (HAF) is the approval authority for all
        other extensions for employees encumbering centrally managed positions (refer also to paragraph
        2.7.3.6.).
AFMAN36-204 11 APRIL 2007                                                                              15


     2.7.2.3. Non-Centrally managed positions. Wing Commanders and HQ Directors retain the flexi-
     bility to approve individual, case-by-case extensions for non-centrally managed positions beyond
     the five- year limitation for covered employees in rare instances provided the employee is per-
     forming acceptably, is current in the knowledge, skills and abilities required for the position, and
     has successfully adapted to the foreign work and cultural environment. Commanders of tenant
     units have authority to approve extensions for their organizations. These extensions, however, are
     designed to provide short-term management flexibility based on local needs and are not intended
     to be used for repetitive extensions or to provide permanent employment in the foreign area.
  2.7.3. Extension Requests - Non-Centrally Managed Positions.
     2.7.3.1. Extension requests are management initiated, but require the concurrence of the
     employee. The request must be in writing, submitted through management channels to the CPF.
     The Wing Commander or HQs Director will approve or disapprove each request to include suc-
     cessive requests that would result in extensions beyond six months in accordance with established
     criteria. The CPF will review the request to ensure it is complete and provide a recommendation
     for approval/disapproval before forwarding to the approval authority. Extensions may be granted
     beyond the five-year limitation at management’s request if the extension request is based on the
     following types of retention determinations:
     2.7.3.2. The incumbent is in a position identified as “hard-to-fill” under current recruitment
     efforts, i.e., recruitment efforts failed to identify a suitable candidate.
     2.7.3.3. Loss of the incumbent would create serious or adverse effects on mission accomplish-
     ment. In this situation, a short-term extension could be approved pending recruitment.
     2.7.3.4. The incumbent is required for completion of a critical time-sensitive project (normally
     short-term).
     2.7.3.5. The incumbent has personal circumstances warranting an extension such as a projected
     retirement (normally within 12 months) or serious health considerations. Extensions should be
     approved only for the minimum time required.
     2.7.3.6. Each extension request forwarded for approval must contain the following:
         2.7.3.6.1. Name of employee.
         2.7.3.6.2. Title, series and grade or pay band equivalent of present position.
         2.7.3.6.3. Organizational assignment and duty location.
         2.7.3.6.4. Date assigned overseas, specific period for which the extension is requested, the
         reason for the request, and why the amount of time is necessary.
         2.7.3.6.5. Statement that the employee’s performance is acceptable, and that he/she is current
         in the knowledge, skills and abilities required in his/her position, and has adapted successfully
         to the foreign working and cultural environment.
         2.7.3.6.6. Total time the employee will have served overseas, without an intervening period of
         service or residence in the U.S. or nonforeign area, as of the beginning date above.
         2.7.3.6.7. Whether or not the employee has return rights. If so, the title, series, grade or pay
         band equivalent, and location of the position to which the employee has return rights, date of
16                                                                       AFMAN36-204 11 APRIL 2007


           return rights expiration and whether those rights will be extended by the activity which
           granted those rights.
           2.7.3.6.8. Efforts taken by management to locate a replacement. Efforts must demonstrate that
           a suitable candidate was not identified after extensive recruitment efforts.
           2.7.3.6.9. Efforts taken to reallocate the work or an explanation as to why reallocation is not
           feasible.
       2.7.3.7. Extension Requests Beyond the Five-Year Limitation – Centrally Managed Career Field
       Positions.
           2.7.3.7.1. The provisions of the Career Field Overseas Employment and Return Placement
           (AFMAN 36-606, Vol. 1) apply to all centrally managed career field placements in foreign
           areas, Alaska, Guam, and U.S. territories and possessions. Extension requests are processed in
           accordance with AFMAN 36-606, Air Force Civilian Career Program Management, Volume I.
           2.7.3.7.2. Management-initiated extension requests must be submitted through the servicing
           CPF to the appropriate Career Field Management Team for approval by the career field Func-
           tional Manager. Prior to submission of the request, the coordination of the overseas MAJCOM
           functional expert must be obtained. Additionally, the MAJCOMA1C must coordinate, if
           required by the MAJCOM.
           2.7.3.7.3. Recommendations to approve or disapprove extensions of employees occupying
           centrally managed position requests are based on the following reasons:
               2.7.3.7.3.1. Assignment of an individual to a hard-to-fill position.
               2.7.3.7.3.2. Application of the limitation would have an adverse impact on mission
               accomplishment.
           2.7.3.7.4. Completion of a critical project.
           2.7.3.7.5. Personal circumstances which warrant a short-term extension.
       2.7.3.8. Records of all extension requests are retained by the CPF.

2.8. Extensions Not Requiring Approval. Employees serving overseas without return rights, those with
return rights to positions which have been abolished (and whose return would require a reduc-
tion-in-force), and those with return rights to positions which have been functionally transferred may be
allowed or required to seek employment in CONUS by registration in the DoD PPP. Continuation of these
employees beyond five years during such registration does not require approval.

2.9. Effect of Extensions on Return Rights. Employees granted return rights must exercise them within
five years unless an extension of the return rights is approved by the U.S. activity where return rights
exist. If extension of return rights is disapproved by the U.S. activity, return placement will be effected in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the DoD PPP. U.S. activities to which return rights exist will
advise the employee’s servicing CPF in writing when return rights have been forfeited. The overseas
activity, with notification to the U.S. activity to which return rights have been granted, may grant one
short-term extension (up to 6 months), beyond the initial five-year period, if advantageous to the Govern-
ment, or for personal reasons based on substantial special need or hardship without loss of return rights.

                                               Chapter 3

                          OVERSEAS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

3.1. General Information.
   3.1.1. DoD has established a policy of rotation for employees assigned to positions in the competitive
   service in foreign areas. This rotation policy limits the period of authorized foreign area employment
   to a period of five years unless exempt from the rotation policy or an extension is granted.
   3.1.2. The rotation policy does not guarantee any Air Force employee a five-year foreign area assign-
   ment. An employee on a career or career-conditional appointment may be required to return from a
   foreign area, at the option of the foreign overseas activity, consistent with the terms of the foreign
   overseas employment agreement entered into prior to the assignment. Management may exercise the
   option to return any employee, including those on exempt positions. Return is affected by exercise of
   return rights, as applicable, or by registration for return placement assistance in the DoD PPP (if oth-
   erwise eligible for registration).
   3.1.3. The servicing CPF will ensure that any candidate who is appointed, assigned or converted to an
   appropriated fund position in a foreign area; Alaska, U.S. territories and possessions, and Hawaii;
   from a non-foreign area to a foreign area; or between foreign areas; signs the appropriate overseas
   employment agreement that establishes the conditions and entitlements related to such assignment.
   The agreement is required whether or not the employee is to serve in a position subject to the rotation
   policy and will be filed in the Official Personnel Folder (OPF) to document the employee’s under-
   standing of the overseas rotation requirement.
   3.1.4. The overseas employment agreement established at the time of hire for an overseas position is
   binding and cannot be unilaterally amended. If a self-sponsored employee’s family status changes,
   such as marriage to a military member, an adjustment of the date of estimated return from overseas
   (DEROS) to coincide with the spouse’s can be done by an extension with management approval. The
   employee is still subject to rotation, however, and is not guaranteed an initial or subsequent adjust-
   ment to DEROS based solely on the spouse’s tour extension.
   3.1.5. Failure to sign an agreement or failure by the CPF to provide the applicable agreement does not
   exempt the employee from the terms of the appropriate agreement. In the event the agreement was not
   signed at the time of appointment or conversion to a competitive service position, the employee is
   notified in writing of the rotation requirements and of the obligation to return after completion of the
   allowable foreign area service.

3.2. List of Sample Overseas Employment Agreements. Refer to Figure 3.1. through Figure 3.12. for
specific Overseas Employment Agreements required for use when employees are assigned, appointed or
converted to positions overseas:

                                      ASSIGNMENT TO A FOREIGN AREA
                                            (With Return Rights)
This agreement must be signed by an employee serving on a career or career-conditional appointment selected for assignment
to a position in a foreign area who has return rights
(Note: Refer to Figure 3.8. for employees who have return rights and are assigned to Alaska and U.S. territories and posses-
sions).


1. This document represents an agreement between the Air Force and the undersigned and becomes effective upon my assign-
ment to:


Position Title, Series and Grade or Pay Band __________________________________


Location: _______________________________________________________________


2. By accepting this assignment to a foreign area, I understand and agree to the following:


         a. My initial period of foreign service is limited to the established tour of duty for the area to which assigned. Any
extension beyond the initial period of foreign service is subject to management’s approval and my concurrence. Any prior DoD
foreign service not interrupted by the required period of residence in the United States or non-foreign area will reduce the
allowable period of service I am authorized employment in a position subject to the DoD five-year foreign area limitation pol-
icy.


          b. If I am authorized, and elect to exercise renewal agreement travel for the purpose of serving a subsequent tour of
duty in the same or another foreign area, my period of service will then be limited to the prescribed tour required by such agree-
ment. Any extension beyond that period is subject to management’s approval and my concurrence.


         c. DoD policy limits foreign area service of employees assigned to positions subject to the DoD rotation policy to a
period of five years. My foreign service will be limited by that policy if, after completion of five years foreign area service, I
am serving in or assigned to a position subject to the DoD rotation policy.


         d. When notified that my foreign service will not be extended beyond the initial or subsequent tour of duty, or when
advised that my return is required because of the DoD rotation policy, I agree to request return assignment by applying to exer-
cise my return rights, or, if those rights have expired, by registration in the DoD Priority Placement Program (PPP). Further, I
agree to accept the position offered from such application or registration that will fulfill my obligation to return from the for-
eign area. I understand that procedures for return placement through the DoD PPP are established in accordance with the DoD
PPP Operations Manual and Air Force guidance which requires mandatory expansion of the PPP registration to include all
DoD activities in the Continental United States (CONUS) after the initial 6-month registration period.
3. I understand that I have been granted return rights to my former position of


__________________________________ at (Location)_____________________________
AFMAN36-204 11 APRIL 2007                                                                                                      19

I understand that I must satisfactorily complete the required period of overseas service established for the area to which I am
assigned. I understand that I must apply to exercise my return rights. In order to assure availability of return transportation at
the time I desire to exercise my return rights, and to provide sufficient advance notice to the activity to which my return rights
apply, I will notify my servicing CPF at least 6 months in advance of the date I wish to depart from the overseas area. Any early
release from the period specified in my transportation agreement must be approved by the overseas activity. Unless terminated
for a reason listed below, I understand my return rights expire five years after my assignment overseas, unless an extension is
granted. Return rights are terminated earlier for any of the following reasons:


         a. Resignation.


         b. Separation for cause.


         c. Assignment to any DoD activity in CONUS or Hawaii.


        d. Transfer to another DoD component position outside the Department of the Air Force (not identified in Chapter 7,
paragraph 7.4.1.).


         e. Transfer to any agency outside DoD.


         f. Failure to accept the position to which return rights applies.


4. If my former position does not exist when I exercise my return rights, I understand I will be returned to a vacant position at
the same grade level or pay band equivalent as that to which I have return rights or to a position at the same grade level or pay
band equivalent which has been established for 90 days. If I am returned to a position established for 90 days, I understand that
I will be placed in a continuing position (for which I qualify), at that grade or pay band equivalent if a position becomes avail-
able during that period. Otherwise, my assignment rights beyond that 90-day period will be determined by reduction-in-force
(RIF) procedures. I also understand that my return rights may be transferred to a different geographic area in the event the func-
tion to which my return rights apply is transferred, or if my former activity has been deactivated.


5. I understand and accept the conditions established in this agreement. I understand that failure to request and accept return
assignment as I have agreed to do in paragraph 2 above may result in my involuntary separation from Air Force employment.

                                             (Without Return Rights)
An employee or applicant on a career or career conditional appointment without return rights who was selected for assignment
to an Air Force position in a foreign area, who is eligible to sign a transportation agreement, must sign this agreement. This
includes an employee hired locally in a foreign area who is eligible to sign a transportation agreement. Excluded are family
members of military members or civilian employees who are on a permanent change of station (PCS) move to the foreign area.


Note: Refer to Figure 3.9. for employees assigned to Alaska and U.S. territories and possessions without specific return rights.


1. This document represents an agreement between the Air Force and the undersigned and becomes effective upon my assign-
ment to:


Position Title, Series and Grade or Pay Band: ___________________________________ Location:
______________________________________________________________


2. By accepting this assignment to an overseas area, I understand and agree to the following limitations that are imposed on the
length of time that I am authorized to remain in this or another overseas area.


         a. My initial period of overseas service is limited to the established tour of duty (used to establish return transportation
entitlement) for the area to which assigned. Any extension beyond this period is subject to my concurrence and management
approval.


          b. If I am authorized, and elect to exercise renewal agreement travel for the purpose of serving a subsequent tour of
duty in the same or another overseas area, my period of service will then be limited to the established tour required by such
agreement. Any extension beyond that period is subject to my concurrence and management approval.


         c. DoD policy limits foreign area service to five years for employees assigned to positions subject to the DoD rotation
policy. My foreign service will be limited by that policy if, after completion of five years foreign area service, I am serving in,
or assigned to, a position subject to the DoD rotation policy. Any prior DoD foreign service not interrupted by the required
period of residence in the United States or non-foreign area will reduce the allowable period of service I am authorized employ-
ment in a position subject to the DoD rotation policy.


          d. When notified that my foreign service will not be extended beyond the initial or subsequent tour of duty, or when
advised that my return is required because of the DoD rotation policy, I agree to request return assignment to the United States
by registration in the DoD Priority Placement Program (PPP). Further, I agree to accept the position offered from such registra-
tion that will fulfill my obligation to return from the foreign area. I understand that procedures for return placement through the
DoD Priority Placement Program are established in accordance with the DoD PPP Operations Manual and Air Force guidance
which requires mandatory expansion of the PPP registration to include all DoD activities in CONUS after the 6 month initial
registration period.
AFMAN36-204 11 APRIL 2007                                                                                                     21

3. I understand that I do not have return rights. I will be provided placement assistance for assignment in the United States
through registration in the DoD PPP after completion of the period of overseas service required for such registration. I agree to
accept a “valid” position offer from such registration. Declination of a valid offer or failure to comply with Department of
Defense, Department of the Air Force, or PPP requirements, shall result in forfeiture of PPP eligibility. Additionally, employ-
ees with return rights may be directed to exercise their return rights, and those without return rights may be subject to involun-
tary separation.


4. I understand and accept the conditions established in this agreement. I understand that failure to request and accept return
assignment as I have agreed to do in paragraph 2 above may result in my involuntary separation from Air Force employment.

This agreement must be signed by an employee or applicant appointed locally or converted in a foreign area to a career or
career-conditional appointment who is not eligible to sign a transportation agreement. (Excluded are family members of mili-
tary or civilian members who are on a permanent change of station (PCS) to the foreign area).


1. This document represents an agreement between the Air Force and the undersigned and becomes effective upon my assign-
ment to:


Position Title, Series and or Pay Band: ____________________________________


Location: ______________________________________________________________


2. I understand the position (is) (is not) one in which foreign area service is limited by DoD policy to five years.


3. By accepting this assignment, I understand and agree to the limitations that are imposed on the length of time I am autho-
rized to remain in this or another foreign area. I understand that DoD policy limits foreign area service of employees to a total
of five years and that I will be required to return to the United States at the end of that period unless an extension is granted.
Any prior DoD foreign service not interrupted by a one-year period of residence in the United States or nonforeign area will
reduce the allowable period of service I am authorized to be employed in a position subject to the rotation policy. I understand
my period of allowable foreign service will terminate on (date) ____________.


4. I understand that I will be provided placement assistance for return to the United States after completion of the period of ser-
vice required for such registration. If I am serving in a position in which foreign service is limited, I agree to request return
placement when notified that my return is required. Further, I agree to accept the position offered which will fulfill my obliga-
tion to return from the foreign area. I understand that procedures for priority return placement are established in accordance
with the DoD PPP Operations Manual and Air Force guidance that require mandatory expansion of the PPP registration to
include all DoD activities in CONUS if not placed during the initial 6-month registration period. Declination of a valid offer or
failure to comply with Department of Defense, Department of the Air Force, or PPP requirements, shall result in forfeiture of
PPP eligibility.


5. I understand and accept the conditions established in this agreement. I also understand that failure to request and accept
return assignment as I have agreed to do under the terms of this agreement may result in my involuntary separation from Air
Force employment.

This agreement must be signed by employees who are family members of assigned military members or civilian employees on
permanent change of station (PCS) orders to the overseas location who have been appointed or converted to career or
career-conditional appointments in a foreign area.


1. This document represents an agreement between the Air Force and the undersigned and becomes effective upon assignment
to:


Position Title, Series, and or Pay Band: ______________________________________


Location: _______________________________________________________________


2. As a family member of a military member or civilian employee, I understand that I am exempt from the DoD rotation policy
that limits the authorized period of foreign area service. In the event I lose my status of family member, or I elect to remain in
the foreign area after departure of my sponsor, I understand I will no longer be exempt from the DoD rotation policy. I under-
stand that when I am no longer exempt from the DoD rotation policy, my authorized period of service will terminate after a
period of time equivalent to one renewal agreement tour of duty, beginning with the date of change, or after a total of five years
overseas service, including service immediately prior to the assignment, whichever is later. Unless an extension is granted, I
understand that I will be required to return to the United States at the end of the authorized period on which I am serving.


3. If I lose my status as a family member, I understand that I may be provided placement assistance for return assignment to the
United States through registration in the DoD Priority Placement Program (PPP) after completion of the period of service
required for such registration. When notified that my foreign service will not be extended, I agree to request return assignment
by registration in that program. Further, I agree to accept the position offered which will fulfill my obligation to return from the
foreign area. I understand that procedures for return placement are established in accordance with the DoD PPP Operations
Manual and Air Force guidance that require mandatory expansion of the PPP registration to include all DoD activities in
CONUS if not placed after the initial 6-month registration period. Declination of a valid offer or failure to comply with Depart-
ment of Defense, Department of the Air force, or PPP requirements, shall result in forfeiture of PPP eligibility.


4. I understand and accept the conditions established in this agreement. I also understand that failure to request and accept
return assignment as agreed to under the conditions of this agreement may result in my separation from Air Force employment.

Figure 3.5. OVERSEAS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT
                     (NOT OBTAINED AT TIME OF ASSIGNMENT/CONVERSION)
This agreement is to be signed by employees serving in a position in a foreign area on a career or career-conditional appoint-
ment from whom the required Overseas Employment Agreement was not obtained at the time of assignment or conversion.


1. This agreement advises you of DoD policy that limits the duration of foreign area service in certain positions to five years.
Employees who are on career or career-conditional appointments in foreign areas are required to sign, at the time of assignment
or conversion, an overseas employment agreement that acknowledges the policy is a condition of employment.


2. A review of your records reveals that the required agreement was not obtained from you on ________________, the date of
your assignment/conversion to a career or career conditional appointment. You are hereby advised that such administrative
oversight does not exempt you from the DoD rotation policy. You will be subject to the same requirements applied to other
employees from whom the agreement was obtained. Those procedures and conditions are explained in the following para-
graphs.


3. An employee serving in a position subject to the foreign area service limitation is required to return to the United States after
completion of the allowable period of service. Such return is affected by exercise of return rights, if applicable, or by registra-
tion for placement through the DoD Priority Placement Program (PPP). Procedures for placement through the PPP are estab-
lished in accordance with the DoD PPP Operations Manual and Air Force guidance that requires mandatory expansion of the
PPP registration to include all DoD activities in CONUS if not placed after the initial 6-month registration period. Declination
of a valid offer or failure to comply with Department of Defense, Department of Air Force, or PPP requirements, shall result in
forfeiture of PPP eligibility. Additionally, employees with return rights may be directed to exercise their return rights, and
those without return rights may be subject to involuntary separation.


4. The impact of the rotation policy as it affects you is reflected by the paragraph checked below:


     a. (__) You are currently assigned to a position in which foreign area service is limited. You have already completed, or are
     within two years of completing, the normal five-year period. To give you sufficient advance notice for planning purposes,
     you are hereby advised that your allowable foreign service is extended until ________________. If you are still assigned
     to a position subject to this limitation, you will be expected to register for placement in the United States by that date. Any
     return rights previously granted to you will expire on the date originally scheduled unless extended by the activity that
     granted those rights.


     b. (__) You are currently assigned to a position in which foreign area service is limited. Your allowable foreign area service
     will be completed ___________. If on that date you are still assigned to a position subject to that limitation, you will reg-
     ister in the DOD Priority Placement Program for return placement in the United States.


     c. (__) You are not currently assigned to a position in which foreign area service is limited by the DoD policy. If you are
     later assigned to a position subject to the limitation, your foreign service will then be restricted to a period of time equiva-
     lent to one renewal agreement tour of duty, beginning with the date of change, or after a total of five years overseas service
     including the service immediately prior to the assignment, whichever is later.


5. You are advised that failure to accept an offer of assignment to a position in the United States made to satisfy a return obli-
gation as discussed in this agreement, may result in your separation from Air Force employment.

6. You should contact a representative in the Civilian Personnel Flight to discuss the options available to you.

ber, my employment will be terminated within 60 days and I will not be eligible for severance pay.

2. By accepting this assignment in a foreign area, I understand and agree to the following limitations that are imposed on the
length of time I am authorized to remain in this or another foreign area:


         a. Department of Defense (DoD) policy limits foreign area service of employees assigned to positions subject to the

overseas service, I am serving in or assigned to a position subject to rotation. Any extension beyond five years is subject to
management’s approval.


         b. In computing the period of allowable overseas employment, all prior appropriated fund employment with the DoD
in foreign areas not interrupted by the required period of service or residence in the United States or nonforeign area is counted.

                      ASSIGNMENT TO ALASKA OR U.S. TERRITORIES AND POSSESSIONS
                                         (With Return Rights)
This agreement must be signed by an employee serving on a career or career-conditional appointment selected for assignment
to an Air Force position in Alaska, or the United States territories and possessions who has return rights.


1. This document represents an agreement between the Air Force and the undersigned and becomes effective upon my assign-
ment to:


Position Title, Series and Grade or Pay Band: __________________________________ Location:
_______________________________________________________________


2. By accepting this assignment to an overseas area, I understand and agree to the following:


         a. My initial period of overseas service is limited to the established tour of duty for the area to which assigned. Any
extension beyond the initial period of overseas service is subject to management’s approval and my concurrence. (Note: In the
case of Alaska, management approves extensions up to five years. After that period, there is no need to approve extensions.)


         b. If I am authorized, and elect to exercise renewal agreement travel (RAT) for the purpose of serving a subsequent
tour of duty in the same or another overseas area, my period of service will then be limited to the prescribed tour required by
such agreement. Any extension beyond that period is subject to management’s approval and my concurrence. Note: RAT does
not apply for moves to Alaska.


          c. When notified that my overseas service will not be extended beyond the initial or subsequent tour of duty, I agree
to request return assignment by applying to exercise my return rights, or, if those rights have expired, by registration in the
DoD Priority Placement Program (PPP). Further, I agree to accept the position offered from such application or registration that
will fulfill my obligation to return from the overseas area. I understand that procedures for return placement through the DoD
PPP are established in accordance with the DoD PPP Operations Manual and Air Force guidance which requires mandatory
expansion of the PPP registration to include all DoD activities in the Continental United States (CONUS) after the initial 6
month registration period. Declination of a valid offer or failure to comply with Department of Defense, Department of the Air
Force, or PPP requirements, shall result in forfeiture of PPP eligibility. Additionally, employees with return rights may be
directed to exercise their return rights, and those without return rights may be subject to involuntary separation.


3. I understand that I have been granted return rights to my former position of_______________________________ at (Loca-
tion)__________________________. I understand that I must satisfactorily complete the required period of overseas service
established for the area to which I am assigned and that I must apply to exercise my return rights. In order to assure availability
of return transportation at the time I desire to exercise my return rights, and to provide sufficient advance notice to the activity
to which my return rights apply, I will notify my servicing CPF at least 6 months in advance of the date I wish to depart from
the overseas area. Any early release from the period specified in my transportation agreement must be approved by the over-
seas activity. Unless terminated for a reason listed below, I understand my return rights expire five years after my assignment
overseas, unless an extension is granted. Return rights are terminated earlier for any of the following reasons:


         a. Resignation
AFMAN36-204 11 APRIL 2007                                                                                                      29

         b. Separation for cause.


         c. Assignment to any DoD activity in CONUS or Hawaii.


        d. Transfer to another DoD component position outside the Department of the Air Force (not identified in Chapter 7,
paragraph 7.4.a).


         e. Transfer to any agency outside DoD.


         f. Failure to accept the position to which return rights applies.


4. If my former position does not exist when I exercise my return rights, I understand I will be returned to a vacant position at
the same or pay band equivalent level as that to which I have return rights or to a position at the same or pay band equivalent
level which has been established for 90 days. If I am returned to a position established for 90 days, I understand that I will be
placed in a continuing position (for which I qualify), at that grade level or pay band equivalent if a position becomes available
during that period. Otherwise, my assignment rights beyond that 90-day period will be determined by reduction-in-force (RIF)
procedures. I also understand that my return rights may be transferred to a different geographic area in the event the function to
which my return rights apply is transferred, or if my former activity has been deactivated. I understand that management may
initiate my return when it is in the best interest of the Air Force at anytime during the five-year return rights period.


5. I understand the five-year foreign area limit does not apply to this assignment.


6. I understand and accept the conditions established in this agreement. I understand that failure to request and accept return
assignment as I have agreed to do in paragraph 2 above may result in my involuntary separation from the Air Force.

This agreement must be signed by an employee who does not have return rights serving on a career or career-conditional
appointment selected for assignment to an Air Force position in Alaska or the U.S. territories and possessions.


1. This document represents an agreement between the Air Force and the undersigned and becomes effective upon my assign-
ment to:


Position Title, Series and Grade or Pay Band: ___________________________
Location: ______________________________________________________________


2. By accepting this assignment to an overseas area, I understand and agree to the following:


         a. My initial period of overseas service is limited to the established tour of duty for the area to which assigned. Any
extension beyond the initial period of overseas service is subject to management’s approval and my concurrence. (Note: In the
case of Alaska, management approves extensions up to five years. After that period, there is no need to approve extensions.)


         b. If I am authorized, and elect to exercise renewal agreement travel (RAT) for the purpose of serving a subsequent
tour of duty in the same or another overseas area, my period of service will then be limited to the prescribed tour required by
such agreement. Any extension beyond that period is subject to management’s approval and my concurrence. Note: RAT does
not apply for moves to Alaska.


          c. When notified that my overseas service will not be extended beyond the initial or subsequent tour of duty, I agree
to request return assignment to the United States by registration in the DoD Priority Placement Program (PPP). Further, I agree
to accept the position offered from such application or registration that will fulfill my obligation to return from the overseas
area. I understand that procedures for return placement through the DoD PPP are established in accordance with the DoD PPP
Operations Manual and Air Force guidance which requires mandatory expansion of the PPP registration to include all DoD
activities in the Continental United States (CONUS) after the initial 6 month registration period. Declination of a valid offer or
failure to comply with Department of Defense, Department of the Air Force, or PPP requirements, shall result in forfeiture of
PPP eligibility. Additionally, employees with return rights may be directed to exercise their return rights, and those without
return rights may be subject to involuntary separation.


3. I understand that I do not have specific return rights. I will be provided placement assistance for assignment in the United
States through registration in the DoD Priority Placement Program, after completion of the period of overseas service required
for such registration. I agree to accept a “valid” position offer from such registration. I understand that management may ini-
tiate my return when it is in the best interest of the Air Force at anytime during the initial five-year assignment period.


4. I understand the five-year foreign area limit does not apply to this assignment.


5. I understand and accept the conditions established in this agreement. I understand that failure to request and accept return
assignment as I have agreed to do in paragraph 2 above may result in my involuntary separation from the Air Force.

                                            (Without Return Rights)
This agreement must be signed by an employee serving on a career or career-conditional appointment who was recruited for
assignment from a career broadener/intern position to an Air Force position in a foreign area.


1. This document represents an agreement between the Air Force and the undersigned and becomes effective upon my assign-
ment to:


Position Title, Series and Grade or Pay Band: ____________________________________


Location: _______________________________________________________________


2. By accepting this assignment to a foreign area, I understand and agree to the following limitations that are imposed on the
length of time I am authorized to remain in this or another foreign area.


         a. My initial period of foreign service is limited to the established tour of duty for the area to which assigned. Any
extension beyond the initial period of foreign service is subject to management’s approval and my concurrence. Any prior DoD
foreign service not interrupted by the required period of residence in the United States or non-foreign area will reduce the
allowable period of service I am authorized to be employed in a position subject to the DoD rotation policy.


          b. If I am authorized, and elect to exercise renewal agreement travel for the purpose of serving a subsequent tour of
duty in the same or another foreign area, my period of service will then be limited to the prescribed tour required by such agree-
ment. Any extension beyond that period is subject to management’s approval and my concurrence.


         c. DoD policy limits foreign area service of employees assigned to positions subject to the DoD rotation policy to a
period of five years. My foreign service will be limited by that policy if, after completion of five years foreign area service, I
am serving in or assigned to a position subject to the DoD rotation policy.


          d. When notified that my foreign service will not be extended beyond the initial or subsequent tour of duty, or when
advised that my return is required because of the DoD rotation policy, I agree to request return assignment by applying to exer-
cise my return rights, or, if those rights have expired, by registration in the DoD Priority Placement Program (PPP). Further, I
agree to accept the position offered from such application or registration that will fulfill my obligation to return from the for-
eign area. I understand that procedures for return placement through the DoD PPP are established in accordance with the DoD
PPP Operations Manual and Air Force guidance which require mandatory expansion of the PPP registration to include all DoD
activities in the CONUS after the initial 6 month registration period. Declination of a valid offer or failure to comply with
Department of Defense, Department of the Air Force, or PPP requirements, shall result in forfeiture of PPP eligibility. Addi-
tionally, employees with return rights may be directed to exercise their return rights, and those without return rights may be
subject to involuntary separation.


3. I understand that I have been granted return rights to my former position of ____________________________________ at
(Location) _________________________
AFMAN36-204 11 APRIL 2007                                                                                                          33

and that this position was cancelled on my assignment overseas. I understand that I must satisfactorily complete the required
period of overseas service established for the area to which I am assigned. I understand that I must apply to exercise my return
rights. In order to assure availability of return transportation at the time I desire to exercise my return rights, and to provide suf-
ficient advance notice to the activity to which my return rights apply, I will notify my servicing CPF at least 6 months in
advance of the date I wish to depart from the overseas area. Any early release from the period specified in my transportation
agreement must be approved by the overseas activity. Unless terminated for a reason listed below, I understand my return rights
expire five years after my assignment overseas, unless an extension is granted. Return rights are terminated earlier for any of
the following reasons:


         a. Resignation


         b. Separation for cause.


         c. Assignment to any DoD activity in CONUS or Hawaii.


        d. Transfer to another DoD component position outside the Department of the Air Force (not identified in Chapter 7,
paragraph 7.4.1.).


         e. Transfer to any agency outside DoD.


         f. Failure to accept the position to which return rights applies.


4. Since my former position will not exist when I exercise my return rights, I understand I will be returned to a vacant position
at the same or pay band equivalent level as that to which I have return rights or to a position at the same grade level or pay band
equivalent which has been established for 90 days. If I am returned to a position established for 90 days, I understand that I will
be placed in a continuing position (for which I qualify), at that grade level or pay band equivalent if a position becomes avail-
able during that period. Otherwise, my assignment rights beyond that 90-day period will be determined by reduction-in-force
(RIF) procedures. I also understand that my return rights may be transferred to a different geographic area in the event the func-
tion to which my return rights apply is transferred, or if my former activity has been deactivated.


5. I understand and accept the conditions established in this agreement. I understand that failure to request and accept return
assignment as I have agreed to do in paragraph 2 and 3 above may result in my involuntary separation from Air Force employ-
ment.

             ASSIGNMENT TO ALASKA OR U.S. TERRITORIES AND POSSESSIONS
                    FROM A CAREER BROADENER/INTERN POSITION
                               (Without Return Rights)
An employee serving on a career or career-conditional appointment must sign this agreement who was recruited from a career
broadener/intern position for assignment to an Air Force position in Alaska or the United States territories and possessions.


1. This document represents an agreement between the Air Force and the undersigned and becomes effective upon my assign-
ment to:


Position Title, Series and Grade or Pay Band: __________________________________


Location: _______________________________________________________________


2. I understand that I have been granted return rights to my former position of __________________________________ at
(location)___________________________
and that this position was cancelled when I accepted assignment overseas. I understand that I must satisfactorily complete the
required period of overseas service established for the area to which I am assigned. I understand that I must apply to exercise
my return rights. In order to assure availability of return transportation at the time I desire to exercise my return rights, and to
provide sufficient advance notice to the activity to which my return rights apply, I will notify my servicing CPF at least 6
months in advance of the date I wish to depart from the overseas area. Any early release from the period specified in my trans-
portation agreement must be approved by the overseas activity. Unless terminated for a reason listed below, I understand my
return rights expire five years after my assignment overseas, unless an extension is granted. Return rights are terminated earlier
for any of the following reasons:


         a. Resignation


         b. Separation for cause.


         c. Assignment to any DoD activity in CONUS or Hawaii.


        d. Transfer to another DoD component position outside the Department of the Air Force (not identified in Chapter 7,
paragraph 7.4.1.).


         e. Transfer to any agency outside DoD.


         f. Failure to accept the position to which return rights applies.


3. Since my former position will not exist when I exercise my return rights, I understand I will be returned to a vacant position
at the same or pay band equivalent level as that to which I have return rights or to a position at the same or pay band equivalent
level which has been established for 90 days. If I am returned to a position established for 90 days, I understand that I will be

placed in a continuing position (for which I qualify), at that grade level or pay band equivalent if a position becomes available
during that period. Otherwise, my assignment rights beyond that 90-day period will be determined by reduction-in-force (RIF)
procedures. I also understand that my return rights may be transferred to a different geographic area in the event the function to
which my return rights apply is transferred, or if my former activity has been deactivated. I understand that management may
initiate my return when it is in the best interest of the Air Force at anytime during the five-year return rights period.


4. I understand the five-year foreign area limit does not apply to this assignment.


5. I understand and accept the conditions established in this agreement. Failure to request and accept return assignment as I
have agreed to do in paragraph 2 above may result in my involuntary separation from Air Force employment.

the provisions of this instruction for assignment to Hawaii.


1. This document represents an agreement between the Air Force and the undersigned and becomes effective upon my assign-
ment to:

                                                Chapter 4

  RECRUITMENT OF U.S. CITIZENS FOR POSITIONS IN FOREIGN OVERSEAS AREAS

4.1. Scope. This subchapter establishes the policies and procedures for recruiting and filling positions in
the overseas area with the exception of SES positions.

4.2. Procedure. In the interest of economy, the best-qualified candidates available locally should be uti-
lized to the maximum extent possible, consistent with treaty arrangements, laws and other agreements.
This is also consistent with the intent of Congress and the policy of DoD and the Air Force to maximize
employment opportunities for command-sponsored military and civilian spouses and other family mem-
bers.

4.3. Standardized Tours Of Duty For DoD Civilians. The standard tours of duty are specified in the
Joint Travel Regulation, Volume II, (JTR Vol II), Appendix Q. Initial employment agreements and subse-
quent renewal agreements in overseas areas shall be executed for the period specified in JTR Vol II,
Appendix Q.

4.4. Employment Eligibility. Employees or applicants selected for positions covered by the DoD rota-
tion policy are subject to the five-year foreign employment limitation and the 12-month U.S. residency
requirement. Prior foreign overseas service is included when computing the allowable period of service
(refer to paragraph 2.3.) Any candidate who has been employed in foreign areas in a DoD civilian appro-
priated fund position for five years without a subsequent period of residence in the U.S. of at least 12
months may not be selected without an approved extension. Employees who have been employed in for-
eign areas in a DoD civilian appropriated fund position for less than 5 years cannot be selected unless the
period of service required for the new tour, when added to the already served tour, will not exceed five
years. If the combination of the tours exceeds 5 years, then selection cannot be made unless an exception
is obtained.

4.5. Appointments Used for Locally Available U.S. Citizens in Foreign Areas. The employment of
locally available U.S. citizens will be under the following appointment authorities:
   4.5.1. Career and Career-Conditional Appointments. Applicants and employees with personal com-
   petitive status, applicants selected from Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Delegated Examin-
   ing Unit (DEU)/Special Examining Unit (SEU) certificates, OPM/DoD Interchange Agreements, and
   applicants for Veterans’ Employment Opportunities Act (VEOA) will be appointed or converted with
   career or career-conditional tenure.
   4.5.2. Family Member Excepted Service Appointments. Applicants who are family members accom-
   panying military or civilian personnel of U.S. government agencies to the foreign areas who do not
   have personal competitive status are appointed under the Schedule A, 213.3106(b)(6) “family mem-
   ber” appointment authority. Refer also to Chapter 13.
       4.5.2.1. Time limits on Schedule A 213.3106(b)(6) excepted service appointments are based on
       the sponsor’s tour of duty and require the employee to remain a “family member.” When
       requested by management and determined to be in the best interest of the Air Force, the Com-
       manding Officer with appointing authority may approve an extension for up to one year beyond
       the sponsor’s tour for employees who have lost family member status. Extensions for Centrally
38                                                                      AFMAN36-204 11 APRIL 2007


        Managed positions must be coordinated through the appropriate Career Field Management Team
        before forwarding it for Career Field Functional Manager approval. Refer also to Figure 3.6.
     4.5.3. Other foreign overseas positions that are excepted from the competitive service are filled in
     accordance with the requirements, standards and procedures applicable to excepted service positions.
     4.5.4. Temporary/Term Appointments. When positions are filled on a temporary or term basis, the
     appointment authority used will depend on the position and status of the selectee.
     4.5.5. Veterans’ Appointments. The use of the veterans’ appointing authorities as alternative recruit-
     ment sources is determined locally and IAW Air Force policies.
     4.5.6. Overseas Limited Appointments. Locally available candidates, other than those indicated
     above, are appointed under the Overseas Limited appointing authority contained in 5 CFR 301.201,
     and may only be appointed when there is a severe shortage of available candidates after a competitive
     announcement.
        4.5.6.1. Local applicants and employees subject to the DoD rotation policy are appointed or con-
        verted to Overseas Limited NTE appointments.
        4.5.6.2. The established NTE date will reflect the termination date of the normal tour for the loca-
        tion, or any approved extension date, not to exceed the allowable five-year foreign area employ-
        ment.
        4.5.6.3. Local applicants and employees who are not family members, who do not have competi-
        tive status, appointed or converted to positions not subject to the rotation policy are appointed to
        Overseas Limited appointments of indefinite tenure.

4.6. Military Spouse Preference.
     4.6.1. The authority for military spouse preference is PL 99-145, as amended by PL 99-661 and PL
     100-180 (10 U.S.C., Section 133 Note). DoD Instruction 1404.12, Employment of Spouses of Active
     Duty Military Members Stationed Worldwide provides DoD implementing guidance. AFMAN 36-606,
     Volume I, Air Force Civilian Career Program Management, provides Air Force implementing instruc-
     tions for the centrally managed positions . AFMAN 36-203, Staffing Civilian Positions, sets forth
     overall Air Force guidance and procedures for implementing military spouse preference. AFPC/Civil-
     ian Personnel Flights should refer to these directives, as well as any locally developed instructions
     when implementing Military Spouse Preference at foreign overseas area bases.
     4.6.2. When military spouses who are entitled to preference under the provisions of applicable laws
     and instructions are among the “best qualified” on a competitive referral, they will be selected before
     any other competitive candidates unless an exception is granted. The authority to approve such an
     exception is delegated to the Commander to whom the appointing authority is delegated at the loca-
     tion where application is made. That authority may be redelegated to the CPF. Exceptions should be
     rare and based only on compelling hardship to the mission or to the applicant. The CPF will maintain
     documentation on exceptions.
     4.6.3. For foreign areas, the military spouse preference candidate may file an application for employ-
     ment 30 days before anticipated arrival; however, spouses may not receive preference until actually
     reporting to the foreign area CPF. Spouses seeking preference with less than six months time remain-
     ing in the overseas area will not be given military spouse preference. Consideration will be through
     self-nomination for job vacancies.
AFMAN36-204 11 APRIL 2007                                                                               39


  4.6.4. In foreign areas, military spouses without civil service status may exercise military spouse pref-
  erence as a Schedule A 213.3106(b)(6) family member eligible and must notify the CPF of his or her
  intent to claim military spouse preference. A copy of an up-to-date employment application or resume
  and the military member sponsor’s PCS orders confirming relocation to the new active duty station
  are the basic documentation necessary to enable the military spouse preference determination. Con-
  sideration will be through self-nomination for job vacancies.
  4.6.5. 10 USC 1559c makes failure to comply with Veterans preference requirements a prohibited
  personnel practice. Further, 10 USC 1559c requires that DoD not establish a policy that requires the
  selection of a preference eligible spouse in every case, without consideration also being given to other
  highly qualified preference eligible veterans. The only requirement is that highly qualified preference
  eligible veterans who are also military spouse should be identified as such to the selecting official.
40                                                                       AFMAN36-204 11 APRIL 2007


                                                Chapter 5

                                  RECRUITMENT FROM THE U.S.

5.1. Scope. Generally, Air Force employees are recruited from the U.S. for an overseas assignment in
accordance with AFMAN 36-203, Staffing Civilian Positions, and AFMAN 36-606, Volume I, Air Force
Civilian Career Program Management, for centrally managed positions, using applicable merit promo-
tion procedures.

5.2. Selection Priorities. Selection priorities are the same as those established in AFMAN 36-203, Staff-
ing Civilian Positions, for all Air Force positions.

5.3. Counseling Employees on Overseas Employment Requirements. CONUS and OCONUS CPFs
will counsel and assure the eligibility of prospective candidates on meeting special pre-overseas employ-
ment requirements. CPFs shall provide full and accurate information to prospective employees and select-
ees on the overseas area for which they are under consideration, the type of medical services/facilities and
services that will be available to them, the nature of the work they will do, the conditions of their employ-
ment, and their responsibilities to the Air Force. Comprehensive information for selectees who have fam-
ily members with special medical and educational needs is essential. This is especially critical for
selectees who need to make informed decisions whether an assignment to the overseas area is appropriate
for them and any family members with special medical and/or educational needs. See Chapter 6.

5.4. Notifying and Processing Selectees.
     5.4.1. AFPC will make employment offers to selected candidates by telephone, e-mail, fax and/or let-
     ter and inform the losing and gaining activities of acceptance or declination.
     5.4.2. The tentative selection message from AFPC will provide preliminary information to the losing
     CPF (or the CPF doing the courtesy processing) regarding the processing of the employee. As a min-
     imum, this information must include:
AFMAN36-204 11 APRIL 2007                                                                         41

     5.4.2.1. Position title, series, and grade or pay band equivalent of the position and a synopsis of
     major duties of the position.
     5.4.2.2. Duty location.
     5.4.2.3. Length of the tour of duty.
     5.4.2.4. Complete physical requirements (functional and environmental factors) from the SF-78,
     Certificate of Medical Examination, and a reminder that the offer is tentative contingent on satis-
     factory completion of the medical evaluation (refer to Chapter 6).
     5.4.2.5. Passport and visa requirements, if applicable.
     5.4.2.6. Entitlement for travel, transportation, allowances, etc.
     5.4.2.7. Any special requirements (drug-testing, emergency-essential, supervisory/managerial
     probationary period, etc.).
     5.4.2.8. Request for all relevant information concerning any special needs of his or her family
     members, either medical, educational, or other, that may require accommodation at the overseas
     location. (Refer to Chapter 6, paragraph 6.4.)
  5.4.3. When the position offer is made, AFPC will stress that the offer is tentative and contingent on
  satisfactory medical evaluation and will recommend the selectee not take any irreversible actions such
  as selling a home or car until the medical evaluation is completed with satisfactory results. When con-
  sidering candidates from any recruitment source, AFPC should ensure the candidate tentatively
  selected meets all appointment and suitability conditions before any selection is finalized. If the
  selectee accepts, the CPF will immediately begin processing the selectee to include arranging for a
  medical examination, requesting passports and visas as applicable, and initiating any necessary secu-
  rity investigation. The losing CPF or AFPC will also obtain the following information and include it
  in the e-mail message advising the OCONUS CPF or AFPC of the selectee’s acceptance:
     5.4.3.1. Current salary identifying any special salary schedules or pay rates and any within-grade
     increases (WGI) or other projected pay changes scheduled between the time of selection and time
     of departure and highest previous pay rate if other than current rate. This information is necessary
     for the overseas CPF and for AFPC to correctly establish the selectee’s pay.
     5.4.3.2. A determination as to whether or not the selectee will have return rights.
     5.4.3.3. State Criminal History Record Check (SCHRC) and Installation Record Check (IRC)
     clearance dates, if applicable.
     5.4.3.4. If the losing CPF is another foreign overseas base, also provide overseas rotation infor-
     mation such as return rights grade or pay band/base, date continuously employed in overseas area,
     current DEROS, travel agreement expiration date, return rights expiration date, five-year foreign
     area limit date, extension date beyond 5 years, and last renewal agreement travel dates.
     5.4.3.5. Family member information, i.e., name and relationship of all family members and birth
     dates of children.
  5.4.4. The overseas CPF or AFPC, once advised of the employee’s acceptance will:
     5.4.4.1. Determine the selectee’s rate of pay and advise the selectee and the losing CPF.
44                                                                       AFMAN36-204 11 APRIL 2007


        5.4.4.2. Mail/e-mail a processing package to the losing CPF to include, as a minimum, the posi-
        tion description/core document/SCPD, the appropriate overseas employment agreement, a trans-
        portation agreement, housing information and assigned sponsor contact information. Sponsors
        will provide information on the local area necessary to prepare the selectee and family for the
        move to the overseas area, and any special instructions or forms.
        5.4.4.3. Mail/e-mail a notification letter to the selectee and include, as attachments, a copy of the
        position description/core document/SCPD, overseas area information pamphlet/information (if
        available), specific information on benefits and entitlements including shipment of privately
        owned vehicle (POV), housing information and other information on the local area necessary to
        prepare the selectee and family for the move to the overseas area. WEB page addresses of the AF
        base as well as the Family Support Centers may also be provided as a source of information.
     5.4.5. The losing CPF/AFPC is responsible for the overseas processing to include:
        5.4.5.1. Medical Evaluation. Referral for medical evaluation must be done as soon as possible
        upon notification of selection. This is critical since the selection is tentative until the employee
        obtains a satisfactory medical evaluation.
        5.4.5.2. Passport and Visa. Assist the selectee in applying for an official (no fee) passport and
        visa, if applicable, for the selectee and any family members through the local passport agent.
        Obtaining passports takes about 6 to 10 weeks. All passport and visa applications must be made as
        soon as possible after receipt of the selection message and should not be delayed pending receipt
        of the processing package. No fee passport or visa applications must be accompanied by PCS
        orders or an exception letter, or combined with an expedite letter if short-notice tasking, signed by
        the installation commander stating the reason the orders cannot be obtained.
        5.4.5.3. Travel and Transportation. Upon receipt of the completed processing package, the travel
        orders are processed according to applicable procedures.
        5.4.5.4. Security Investigations. If the tentative selectee does not have the appropriate security
        clearance for the position for which selected, initiate the investigation as soon as possible and
        advise the overseas CPF. For positions that require a secret or top-secret clearance, the investiga-
        tion must be completed with satisfactory results before the selectee may enter a travel status unless
        the overseas CPF indicates that the appropriate waiver has been completed in accordance with
        governing instructions on security program management procedures.

5.5. Overseas Employment Requirements.
     5.5.1. .Applicants for overseas assignment must:
        5.5.1.1. Be available for the overseas assignment within 45 to 60 days.
        5.5.1.2. Be willing to remain in the overseas area for at least one full tour of duty and be willing
        to return from an overseas assignment, except Hawaii, within five years after overseas employ-
        ment begins. Minimum tours of duty are outlined in the Joint Travel Regulations, Volume 2, and
        are used to determine the terms for return obligation or a return right. Tours of duty are separate
        and distinct from the length of service requirement to earn return transportation entitlements.
        5.5.1.3. Be willing to travel by government aircraft.
     5.5.2. The servicing CPF should counsel employees on:

       5.5.2.1. The overseas environment by using DoD or Air Force informational pamphlets, informa-
       tion distributed by the CPF or provide information on obtaining other available counseling mate-
       rial such as videos/DVDs on overseas locations that are available at the Family Support Centers
       and various web pages.
       5.5.2.2. Benefits and entitlements intended as recruitment and/or retention incentives by using
       appropriate guidelines and regulations. These entitlements may include topics such as: advance
       pay, foreign transfer allowance, separate maintenance allowance, temporary lodging allowance,
       living quarters allowance, post allowance, post differential, educational travel for family member
       travel, etc. The reference with the explanation of the eligibility for home leave is DoD 1400.25-M,
       Subchapter 1260. The reference for overseas allowances and differentials is the Department of
       State Standardized Regulation (DSSR) and DoD 1400.25-M, Subchapter 1250.
       5.5.2.3. Opportunities for employment of family members, if applicable. Air Force Pamphlet
       36-508, Employment Information for Families Being Assigned to Overseas Areas, may be used to
       assist in the counseling effort.
       5.5.2.4. Non-foreign area entitlements such as cost of living allowances.
       5.5.2.5. The unique overseas employment conditions to include medical facilities available, avail-
       ability of educational services for family members with special needs and prevailing threat condi-
       tions that require terrorist/force protection condition (FPCON) briefings prior to PCS.

5.6. Setting Effective Dates. When a candidate is recruited from the U.S. to the overseas area, the effec-
tive date for overseas employment is the day travel begins. When an employee is returning to the U.S.
from OCONUS, and expenses are borne by the overseas activity, the effective date for employment in the
U.S. from overseas is the estimated date of arrival at the new duty station based on travel time by direct
route as determined by the authorized mode of transportation. However, the effective date can be set to
allow for delays requested by employees for personal reasons if concurred by the receiving organization
and authorized in the travel orders. For OCONUS to OCONUS moves, the effective date is the day travel
begins.

                    MEDICAL STANDARDS AND PHYSICAL REQUIREMENTS

6.1. Physical/Medical Screening Requirements.
     6.1.1. All persons assigned overseas, including those assigned by position change or transfer, are
     required to meet specific physical standards and medical requirements. Positions located overseas are
     subject to the same medical standards and physical requirements that apply to similar positions in the
     U.S.
     6.1.2. Effective selection techniques shall be used to ensure that individuals are fully qualified and
     suited for employment in foreign areas. Overseas activity officials shall provide full and accurate
     information to prospective employees and selectees on the foreign area for which they are being con-
     sidered, the type of medical facilities and services that will be made available to them, the nature of
     the work they will do, the conditions of their employment, and their responsibilities to the command
     and U.S. Government. Comprehensive information, including the provisions of DoD Instruction
     1010.13, Provision of Medically Related Services to Children Receiving or Eligible to Receive Special
     Education in DoD Dependents Schools Outside the U.S. and DoD Instruction 1342.12, Provision of
     Early Intervention and Special Education Services to Eligible DoD Dependents in Overseas Areas,
     and DODI 1315.19 Authorizing Special Needs Family Members Travel Overseas at Government
     Expense, for selectees who have family members with special medical and educational needs is essen-
     tial to enable selectees to make informed decisions about whether an assignment to the foreign area is
     appropriate for them and family members who may accompany them.
     6.1.3. Overseas commands may deny logistical support to family members with medical needs where
     medical facilities and services are limited.

6.2. Functional and Environmental Factors.
     6.2.1. The overseas CPF and subject matter experts determine the functional and environmental fac-
     tors essential to the position being filled. The applicant’s mental and emotional stability and fitness for
     overseas living and working conditions are important considerations in any overseas assignment.
     6.2.2. Tentatively selected candidates are subject to a physical examination by a Federal medical
     officer. Standard Form 78, Certificate of Medical Examination, is used to document the results of the
     examination. The tentative selectee will normally be referred to the Base Medical Facility for screen-
     ing to determine if there is any medical condition which may pose a unique problem or which cannot
     be reasonably accommodated in the overseas area. Note: Overseas physical examinations for posi-
     tions in Alaska and Hawaii are not required, except for positions that require physical exertion which
     are documented in the position description.

6.3. Evaluating Medical Information.
     6.3.1. When the medical evaluation reveals no limiting physical conditions, no conditions requiring
     continuing medical care and no history of psychological problems for the selectee, the medical officer
     will certify there are no limitations that impede selection by completion of Part D, SF-78, Certificate
     of Medical Examination.
AFMAN36-204 11 APRIL 2007                                                                               47


   6.3.2. When the medical examination reveals the tentative selectee does not meet the minimal physi-
   cal and mental capacities necessary for safe and efficient performance in the position for which
   selected, the medical officer will so document on Part D, SF-78, Certificate of Medical Examination.
   When the medical evaluation reveals any limiting physical condition(s), any condition requiring con-
   tinuous medical care or any history of psychological problems, the medical officer will forward com-
   plete supporting documentation to the CPF for review and determination. The determination will be
   coordinated with the selecting official.
   6.3.3. If the selectee has a medical condition that needs continuous monitoring or periodic treatment
   or there is a requirement to take certain medication on a daily basis, medical officials of the overseas
   command should be notified. They can then determine if adequate treatment facilities exist at the
   overseas duty station. The nonavailability of health-care providers, medical facilities, medications and
   treatments are important considerations for the selectee to consider in determining whether to accept
   an overseas assignment.

6.4. Evaluating Special Needs - Family Members.
   6.4.1. Prior to finalizing a selection involving a PCS move to the overseas location, the overseas CPF
   must engage in dialogue with the tentative selectee regarding family member needs to exchange infor-
   mation regarding special needs of family members against available facilities/services at the overseas
   location. IAW DoDI 1315.19, the tentative selectee has the responsibility to provide all relevant infor-
   mation concerning any medical, educational, or other special needs of his or her family members, that
   may require accommodation at the overseas location. Overseas CPF, MPF, and/or MTFs must address
   these needs in writing to allow tentative selectees to make informed decisions regarding the needs and
   well being of their family members.

                                                 Chapter 7

                                            RETURN RIGHTS

7.1. General Information.
     7.1.1. Return rights are established under 10 United States Code (USC), Section 1586. It authorizes
     the establishment of rotation guidance by which return rights are granted by a DoD component to its
     career and career-conditional employees who are assigned within the component to a foreign area,
     Alaska, Guam, the Virgin Islands, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; or who are assigned to DoD
     positions at the foreign areas identified in paragraph 7.4.1. from a post of duty in the U.S. (including
     its territories and possessions). Statutory return rights are granted for a period of five years.
     7.1.2. An employee may exercise return rights after satisfactory completion of a period of service
     agreed upon under the overseas employment agreement, or if earlier release is authorized by that
     activity Commander in accordance with criteria contained in C4009, Volume 2, Joint Travel Regula-
     tions.

7.2. When Return Rights are Authorized.
     7.2.1. Return rights are granted to Air Force employees serving under career or career-conditional
     appointments in the following situations.
        7.2.1.1. Employees who are recruited from the 50 states and the District of Columbia and accept
        an assignment with the Air Force or for DoD positions identified in paragraph 7.4.1. in overseas
        areas. This includes assignment to Alaska from any other state, but not Hawaii where return rights
        are not granted. (Note: As an example, employees in Alaska who have return rights to a base in
        CONUS, Hawaii, or a U.S. territory or possession, the return rights will be retained to that base for
        the duration of the five years, even if the employee accepts another overseas assignment in accor-
        dance with paragraph 7.4.1.). Return rights are forfeited after five years unless the U.S. base
        extends the return rights.
        7.2.1.2. Employees who are residents and recruited from Guam, the Virgin Islands, or the Com-
        monwealth of Puerto Rico for assignment with the Air Force in a foreign area or a U.S. territory or
        possession. Employees on Guam who accept either a foreign area assignment or an assignment to
        Alaska will have return rights to Guam provided the employee is a resident of Guam. For employ-
        ees in Guam serving on an Overseas Employment Agreement with return rights to a U.S. base,
        return rights will continue to that base for the remainder of the five years. After that, return rights
        are forfeited unless extended by the U.S. base. If the employee has already completed the five
        years overseas, he/she will not be granted return rights on assignment to the foreign area base.
        7.2.1.3. Employees recruited from Alaska, Hawaii, or nonforeign overseas areas for OCONUS
        assignments may not be granted statutory return rights if they are not actual residents of those
        areas as defined in C4004 of the Joint Travel Regulations, Volume 2, or if they have existing return
        rights elsewhere.
     7.2.2. Air Force return rights previously granted are preserved when the employee moves to an Air
     Force activity outside CONUS (except to Hawaii) or as specified in 7.4.1. A subsequent move to Air
     Force activities or those specified in 7.4.1. preserves their statutory return rights for five years.
     7.2.3. Exceptions. The following employees are not granted return rights:
AFMAN36-204 11 APRIL 2007                                                                                 49


      7.2.3.1. Employees assigned to or from a position in the Senior Executive Service.
      7.2.3.2. Employees assigned from a position identified for return of another employee previously
      assigned overseas (obligated position).
      7.2.3.3. Employees whose employment will be terminated, voluntarily or involuntarily.
      7.2.3.4. Employees who have declined functional transfer and have not been assigned to another
      position.
      7.2.3.5. Employees who are serving in a non-foreign overseas area (except Hawaii) with an iden-
      tified place of residence outside that area to which return travel is authorized, or for whom return
      travel entitlement will accrue on completion of an agreed upon period of overseas service.
      7.2.3.6. Employees accepting overseas Special Investigations and Auditor positions will have
      return placement under their mobility agreements. Those in Special Investigation positions will
      have their return placement centrally managed by HQ AFOSIA1C in coordination with the Spe-
      cial Investigations Career Field Management Team. Auditors will have their return placement
      managed by the Air Force Audit Agency In coordination with the Financial Management Career
      Field Management Team.

7.3. Administering Return Rights.
   7.3.1. Procedures for administering return rights under these authorities are contained in paragraph
   7.7. Additional requirements necessary for centrally managed positions are included in AFMAN
   36-606, Volume I, Air Force Civilian Career Program Management.
   7.3.2. If an extension beyond the five-year limitation is approved, return rights are forfeited unless the
   activity to which the employee has return rights formally agrees to continue the employee’s return
   rights for the duration of the extended period. If return rights are not extended, return placement is
   effected in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DoD Priority Placement Program.
   Employees are notified in writing by the servicing CPF if their return rights have been forfeited. Nor-
   mally, an initial request for a short-term extension should be approved, particularly if such extension
   is not expected to create placement problems at the activity.
   7.3.3. The OCONUS Civilian Personnel Officer may grant one short-term extension (up to six
   months) beyond the initial five-year period, if advantageous to the Government or for personal rea-
   sons based on special need or hardship. The U.S. activity to which return rights have been granted
   must be notified, in writing, of the short-term return right extension.
   7.3.4. Employees who have return rights to positions that have been or are scheduled to be abolished
   and whose return would initiate a reduction-in-force, or whose exercise of return rights would result
   in separation or a change to lower grade or reduction in pay band, may receive placement assistance,
   if otherwise eligible, in returning from the foreign area through the DoD PPP. Such assistance will
   continue until the employee is placed, declines a valid offer, has an extension of their overseas service
   approved, exercises return rights, or is directed to return.
   7.3.5. CONUS and OCONUS CPFs shall keep each other informed regarding any action that affects
   an employee’s return rights. Employees will be given written notification in a timely manner when the
   position to which they have return rights is changed, moved, or abolished; or when an extension of the
   overseas tour and/or return rights is approved or disapproved.
50                                                                         AFMAN36-204 11 APRIL 2007


7.4. Granting Return Rights Across Components.
     7.4.1. Career and career-conditional employees in the competitive service who are employed in the
     U.S. or in a non-foreign area and who accept an assignment with the Air Force outside the U.S. or in
     Alaska, or Guam are granted statutory return rights for a period of five years. Air Force does not grant
     return rights across component lines to employees who accept foreign area overseas employment,
     unless the assignment is to a position located in Japan, Korea, Johnston Island, Panama, Saudi Arabia,
     DoD positions with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Joint or Unified Commands, Fin-
     land, Israel, Kuwait, Bahrain Island, Malaysia, Russia, United Arab Emirates, Africa, Turkey and
     South America. Employees who volunteer for foreign area overseas employment must obtain
     approval/disapproval in writing from the losing organization. Approval/disapproval is at the discre-
     tion of the losing organization. Losing CPF must obligate the position for return of the employee,
     unless return rights cannot be granted in accordance with this instruction.
     7.4.2. When a foreign area employee transfers to another overseas DoD component, other than to a
     position in a location listed in paragraph 7.4.1., return rights previously granted are forfeited unless
     the activity to which the employee has return rights agrees in writing to continue the employee’s
     return rights. These return rights shall continue for the duration of the five-year period.
     7.4.3. A Stateside organization may grant administrative return rights that do not meet the parameters
     of paragraphs 7.4.1. or 7.4.2. above.
     7.4.4. If an extension beyond the five-year limitation is approved, return rights are forfeited unless the
     activity to which the employee has return rights agrees in writing to continue them for the duration of
     the approved extension. If return rights are forfeited, return placement is effected in accordance with
     the applicable provisions of the DoD Priority Placement Program. (Refer to Figure 7.1.)

NOTES:
     1. Career and career-conditional employees in the competitive service who are employed in the
        U.S. or in a non-foreign area and who accept an assignment with the Air Force outside the
        U.S. or in Alaska, or Guam are granted statutory return rights for a period of five years. Air
        Force does not grant return rights across component lines to employees who accept foreign
        area overseas employment, unless the assignment is to a position located in Japan, Korea,
        Johnston Island, Panama, Saudi Arabia, DoD positions with the North Atlantic Treaty Organi-
        zation (NATO), Joint or Unified Commands, Finland, Israel, Kuwait, Bahrain Island, Malay-
        sia, Russia, United Arab Emirates, Africa, Turkey and South America.
       2. While employed in Alaska, or Guam if an employee is on an Overseas Employment Agree-
          ment with return rights to a base in CONUS, those return rights will be retained for five years,
          even if the employee accepts a foreign area assignment. After that, return rights are forfeited,
          unless the base in the U.S. base extends the return rights.
          Example: An employee with return rights to Wright-Patterson AFB, OH goes on a Permanent
          Change of Station (PCS) move to Alaska and is subsequently selected for a position in Japan.
          If at the time of selection the employee had completed three of the five-year period (to retain
          the return rights entitlement to Wright Patterson), the employee will retain those return rights
          to Wright Patterson for the remainder of the five-year return rights obligation, i.e., two years.
       3. If an employee is in Alaska, or Guam on an Overseas Employment Agreement without return
          rights, the employee will continue to not have return rights on a subsequent move to a foreign
          area or to Alaska, or Guam.



7.5. Conditions Under Which Return Rights Are Lost.
   7.5.1. Return rights are terminated under the following circumstances:
       7.5.1.1. Resignation.
       7.5.1.2. Separation for cause.
       7.5.1.3. Assignment to any DoD activity in CONUS or Hawaii.
       7.5.1.4. Transfer to an agency outside DoD.
       7.5.1.5. Transfer to another DoD component position without approval from the activity to which
       the employee has return rights.
       7.5.1.6. Failure to accept the position to which return rights apply.

7.6. Return Rights for Former Career Broadeners/Interns.
   7.6.1. Career and career-conditional interns and career broadeners selected for overseas assignment
   (except Hawaii) directly from an intern or career broadening position have statutory return rights and
   should sign the Overseas Employment Agreement without Return Rights (Figure 3.10. or Figure
   3.11., whichever is applicable). These agreements apply to those situations where there is not an obli-
   gated position and indicates return rights do not guarantee a permanent position (at the location from
   which recruited) to return to after completion of the overseas assignment. Any employee failing to
52                                                                        AFMAN36-204 11 APRIL 2007


     request and accept return assignment under the conditions of the return rights agreement may face
     separation from Air Force employment.
     7.6.2. Assignment after overseas tour completion is normally accomplished through exercise of
     return rights or through the PPP. However, a management directed reassignment or placement through
     competitive merit promotion procedures may also be used in facilitating placements. If, in the interest
     of USAF mission requirements, a management directed reassignment is the option used for place-
     ment, efforts will be made to accommodate employee’s personal geographic preferences where possi-
     ble.
     7.6.3. An employee originally selected from a career broadener or intern position to an OCONUS
     activity must apply, when completing an overseas tour, to exercise return rights by notifying the ser-
     vicing stateside CPF at least 6 months in advance of the date he or she wishes to return. In many cases,
     a permanent position will not be available for the employee’s return placement. If an appropriate
     vacancy is available at the activity from which the employee was recruited for the overseas assign-
     ment, the gaining and losing CPFs and/or AFPC will coordinate the placement of the employee to the
     position. If no appropriate vacancy exists at the activity from which the employee was recruited, the
     employee will be returned to an established position (for at least 90 days) at the same grade level or
     pay band equivalent the employee held prior to the career broadening assignment. After 90 days if no
     suitable vacancy exists, assignment rights will be determined by reduction-in-force (RIF) procedures.
     The 90-day period and the required RIF notice period may run concurrently. Employees are eligible to
     register in the DoD PPP when notified their return would result in a RIF situation.
     7.6.4. The Career Field Management Team and gaining MAJCOMs should both take an active role in
     the assignment process. At least six months before the end of the overseas tour, the OCONUS CPF
     will notify AFPC/DPI and the MAJCOMA1C of the employee’s interest in exercising return rights as
     well as any other geographic and assignment preferences of the employee. For employees occupying
     centrally managed positions, the appropriate career field management team will assess other projected
     vacancies within the career field and recommend a management-directed reassignment to the vacancy.
     The gaining MAJCOMA1C and servicing MAJCOM Functional Managers have a comparable role
     for non centrally managed positions, and should take a proactive approach in identifying vacancies for
     placement.

7.7. Procedures for Effecting Overseas Return Rights
     7.7.1. 10 USC 1586 provides return rights to employees on Career or Career-Conditional appoint-
     ments who have accepted a position in the overseas area. It outlines actions and responsibilities of the
     releasing activity, the overseas employing activity, and the employee entitled to return rights in accor-
     dance with Chapter 8 of this instruction. It covers procedures for identifying a position to which an
     employee has return rights, maintaining the return right obligation, and effecting placement of an
     employee who applies to exercise those rights or whose return is management-initiated.
     7.7.2. Action required at the Time the Employee Leaves for Overseas Duty.
        7.7.2.1. Identifying the vacated position. To comply with requirements for the return of assigned
        employees, the releasing activity must identify the position to which return rights apply. If an
        employee is assigned to an overseas Air Force activity, the releasing activity must identify, obli-
        gate, and maintain the position to which return rights apply.
AFMAN36-204 11 APRIL 2007                                                                                 53


     7.7.2.2. Maintenance of Records. An individual folder will be established and maintained by the
     releasing activity for each employee granted return rights. In addition, Air Force Personnel Center
     (AFPC) will establish and maintain electronic overseas folders. Included will be a:
         7.7.2.2.1. Copy of the SF-50, Notification of Personnel Action.
         7.7.2.2.2. Copy of the Overseas Employment Agreement.
         7.7.2.2.3. Copy of the COREDOC or position descriptions to which the employee has return
         rights.
         7.7.2.2.4. Copy of the AF Form 1188, Overseas Civilian Personnel Request
         7.7.2.2.5. Copy of the DD 1617, Transportation Agreement - Overseas Employee.
         7.7.2.2.6. Any document which affects return rights, such as Request for Personnel Action,
         changing the classification of, or abolishing the position; and copies of any correspondence
         between the activity which granted return rights and the activity to which assigned.
         7.7.2.2.7. Any other document or item determined to be of benefit in assuring the employee’s
         entitlement to return placement is honored.
  7.7.3. Action on the Return Obligation.
     7.7.3.1. Filling a position with a return right obligation. Prior to placement, the selectee must be
     advised in writing that the position is “obligated to the former employee” and what effect the
     former employee’s return may have on his or her assignment to that position.
     7.7.3.2. Maintaining the return right obligation identified with a position. The return obligation
     identified with a position must remain with it for the duration of the right regardless of changes in
     command jurisdiction over the position. The following requirements are observed in order to
     maintain the return right as changes occur to the position:
         7.7.3.2.1. Transfer of Function. The return obligation is transferred with the position in a
         transfer of function between Air Force activities when the position is identifiable as appearing
         at the new location. It may appear as a vacancy or by movement of the present incumbent with
         the position. If the position cannot be identified, and the functional transfer offer to the present
         incumbent is to a different position, the return obligation is transferred to the gaining activity
         and the procedures of paragraph 7.7.3.3. below are followed. Appropriate documentation will
         be made a part of the record folder established in accordance with paragraph 7.7.2.2. above.
         The return rights entitlement will not be transferred when a function is moved to an agency
         outside the Air Force.
         7.7.3.2.2. Re-Classified Position. The obligation remains with the position when it is
         upgraded or downgraded without significant change in duties and responsibilities because of
         classification error or change in classification standards; or due to accretion of duties when
         there is clear evidence that the new position is a successor position that absorbed the major
         duties of the former position and, had the overseas employee not accepted the overseas assign-
         ment, could have been noncompetitively placed in the position.
         7.7.3.2.3. Cancellation or reconstruction/reconsideration of position. If the position with a
         return obligation is cancelled or restructured, a record of the action is placed in the folder
         described in paragraph 7.7.2.2. above. Return rights are not lost by cancellation of the posi-
54                                                                         AFMAN36-204 11 APRIL 2007


            tion. The return obligation will not be transferred to another position; but is held in abeyance
            until the employee is scheduled to exercise those rights. At that time, the position to which
            entitled is determined in accordance with paragraph 7.7.5. below. If the initial position is
            re-established, the return obligation must be identified with it.
            7.7.3.2.4. Termination of the Activity. Unless either paragraph 7.7.3.2.1., 7.7.3.2.2., or
            7.7.3.2.3. above is applicable, the return right obligation is transferred to an Air Force activity
            in the commuting area. The return obligation will not be identified with a specific position at
            the activity to which it is transferred until the employee is scheduled to exercise those rights. If
            there are no Air Force activities in the area, the MAJCOM that had jurisdiction over the activ-
            ity the employee left for the overseas assignment will assume the return obligation.
        7.7.3.3. Notification Requirements. When a return obligation is transferred under para 7.7.3.2.1.
        or para 7.7.3.2.4. above, both the gaining activity and the overseas activity to which the employee
        is assigned will be officially notified. When the return rights position is changed under para
        7.7.3.2.2. or para 7.7.3.2.3. above, the overseas activity will be notified.
     7.7.4. Action by the Overseas Activity.
        7.7.4.1. The CPF servicing the overseas activity reviews the personnel folder maintained in
        PARIS of each newly assigned employee to identify those who have been granted return rights. A
        record of these employees is maintained and used to advise each employee of his or her eligibility
        to exercise those rights approximately six months prior to completion of a period of service
        required under the tour of duty for that installation (such tours are specified in the JTR, Vol 2), or
        prior to completion of the five-year foreign area limit period. The content of the notice to the
        employee will vary depending on the individual circumstances involved. For example, an
        employee approaching five years overseas service with return rights to a lower-grade or pay band
        position should be advised of the option to register in the DoD PPP for priority return placement
        at his/her current grade or pay band.
        7.7.4.2. The overseas CPF will advise the stateside CPF which granted return rights:
            7.7.4.2.1. If the employee is assigned to another DoD activity overseas.
            7.7.4.2.2. Of any approved extensions.
            7.7.4.2.3. Of any requested extensions beyond five years in order to determine if return rights
            will be preserved.
            7.7.4.2.4. Of any decision by the employee to remain overseas without an approved extension
            of return rights.
            7.7.4.2.5. Of any action identified in Chapter 7, paragraph 7.5., that terminates return rights.
     7.7.5. Position Entitlements. An employee granted return rights is entitled to a position at the activity
     to which return rights apply in the following order:
        7.7.5.1. The position last held prior to assignment overseas. A vacant position at the same grade
        or pay band equivalent for which qualified may be offered; however, the employee may decline
        that alternate assignment and elect to return to his or her former position if it still exists.
        7.7.5.2. If the former position does not exist, the employee is entitled to a vacant position for
        which qualified, at the same grade level or pay band equivalent as the former position.
AFMAN36-204 11 APRIL 2007                                                                                55


     7.7.5.3. If placement cannot be made under paragraphs 7.7.5.1. or 7.7.5.2. above, a position is
     established for 90 calendar days at the same grade level or pay band equivalent and in the same
     competitive level of the position last held before assignment overseas. The employee is assigned
     to that position.
     7.7.5.4. During the 90 calendar days, the employee is entitled to a vacant Air Force position for
     which qualified within the commuting area, which may become available at the current grade or
     pay band. If a vacant position does not become available, the employee is entitled to the best posi-
     tion that can be offered under reduction-in-force procedures. The 90-day period and the required
     RIF notice period may run concurrently.
  7.7.6. Processing a Return at the Employee’s Request.
     7.7.6.1. Employees are expected to apply to exercise return rights no less than six months prior to
     their DEROS to allow for necessary PCS processing and arranging return transportation. Employ-
     ees who are registered in PPP but have return rights to a position at a lower grade or pay band
     equivalent may remain registered in PPP up to 30 days prior to their DEROS. Less than 6 months
     notice may be accepted by mutual agreement between the CPFs. On receipt of the employee’s
     request to exercise return rights, the overseas activity first determines that the required period of
     overseas service will be completed on the date return is requested. If not, the activity Commander
     must determine if the employee is to be released from any remaining period of obligated service
     under criteria in JTR Volume II, paragraph C4009.
     7.7.6.2. If return is authorized, the activity that granted return rights is notified of the employee’s
     request to return. The notice will include the employee’s current position title, series and grade or
     pay band, and the date return is requested.
     7.7.6.3. The activity to which an employee is returning will determine what position is to be
     offered, and advise the overseas activity. An offer other than the employee’s former position must
     include the reason for that alternate offer. If the former position has been abolished, and the
     employee’s return would require a RIF, that information will also be furnished.
     7.7.6.4. When the position has been identified, the overseas activity will notify the employee in
     writing. An employee whose former position has been abolished, and whose return would require
     a RIF, will be advised of the option to register for priority return placement in the DoD PPP. The
     activity to which return rights apply will be advised of the employee’s decision.
  7.7.7. Effecting the Return from Overseas. A mutually agreeable timeframe to affect the overseas
  return is established by the losing and gaining CPFs. The effective date of the personnel action is the
  estimated date of arrival at the stateside activity. However, the effective date can be set to allow for
  delays enroute requested by the employee for personal reasons, if concurred by the gaining activity
  and authorized in the travel orders (see Chapter 5, para 5.6.).
  7.7.8. Displacement Actions. When an employee exercises return rights to his or her former position
  by displacing another employee, RIF procedures may be necessary to determine the assignment right
  of that displaced employee. The returning employee does not compete for placement under RIF pro-
  cedures, except when the former position has been cancelled and return is to a position established for
  a 90-day period.

                                                 Chapter 8

                MANAGEMENT DECISION TO INVOKE RETURN OBLIGATION

8.1. Official Notification.
     8.1.1. Applicability. The procedures in this chapter are used when it becomes necessary for manage-
     ment to initiate action to return an employee to the United States.
     8.1.2. Management-initiated actions may be appropriate when:
        8.1.2.1. An employee subject to the DoD rotation policy who is approaching the expiration of the
        authorized overseas service has not voluntarily applied to exercise return rights or to register for
        priority return placement through the DoD Priority Placement Program (PPP).
        8.1.2.2. The Commander of an overseas activity has determined, in accordance with this manual
        that an employee should be returned when it’s in the best interest of the Air Force.
        8.1.2.3. Through no fault of the employee, his or her training and experience were not properly
        matched with the position for which recruited, and no other position is available to which the
        employee can be assigned at the overseas area base. (This should be coordinated with the appro-
        priate career field management team for employees on centrally managed positions ). In this situ-
        ation, an employee may:
            8.1.2.3.1. Exercise return rights.
            8.1.2.3.2. Register in DoD PPP if the employee has no return rights or return rights are to a
            position at a lower-grade or pay band.
            8.1.2.3.3. The servicing command and the command of the base from which the employee left
            for the overseas area assignment (in coordination with the appropriate career field manage-
            ment team , where applicable) will attempt to find an alternate assignment at a location and at
            a grade level or pay band equivalent acceptable to the employee. If necessary, the servicing
            MAJCOM and/or the Career Field Management Team may seek the assistance of HQ USAF/
            A1XC in resolving the issue.
        8.1.2.4. The provisions in paragraph 8.3.1. apply in Alaska or a U.S. territory or possession when
        an employee is without return rights and when a supervisor or management official elects not to
        renew an employee’s overseas tour during the five-year return rights period, and for those without
        return rights, during the initial five-year overseas period.
     8.1.3. This chapter does not apply to:
        8.1.3.1. An employee who has served continuously in a foreign area prior to 1 Apr 66.
        8.1.3.2. As a means of avoiding responsibility for taking appropriate action for reasons of miscon-
        duct or unacceptable performance.

8.2. Informal Actions. Before initiating the procedures that follow, the appropriate management official
will advise the employee of the circumstances on which the return placement action is based. If the
employee is willing to initiate the return, no further action under this chapter will be necessary.
AFMAN36-204 11 APRIL 2007                                                                                 57


8.3. Return Placement Procedures at the Expiration of Overseas Service.
   8.3.1. The supervisor or other management official will notify an employee of a decision not to
   extend overseas service beyond the initial or subsequent tour of duty no later than 6 months before the
   tour expiration date. The supervisor/management official will remind the employee of the obligation
   to apply for return assignment, immediately notify the CPF of the decision, and arrange an appoint-
   ment for the employee with a member of the CPF to discuss return placement options. The overseas
   CPF will immediately notify the stateside CPF to which the employee has return rights of the decision
   not to extend the employee’s overseas service and the potential of return placement.
   8.3.2. In the event the employee takes no action within 7 workdays from date of notification of
   non-extension to request return assignment, written notification will be given by the CPF to the
   employee and will include:
      8.3.2.1. The decision made not to extend the tour of duty and date the employee was advised.
      8.3.2.2. The obligation to initiate return assignment through exercise of return rights or PPP reg-
      istration, as appropriate, citing the employment agreement or notification where the obligation
      was established.
   8.3.3. Employees completing allowable overseas service with return rights at current or higher grade
   or pay band.
      8.3.3.1. Within 6 months of the expiration of the authorized overseas service, the overseas CPF
      will advise the U.S. CPF where return rights exist that return will be exercised and request identi-
      fication of the position to which return rights apply.
      8.3.3.2. The employee will be advised in writing of the date authorized overseas service will
      expire and of the obligation to return, citing the notification to the employee (overseas employ-
      ment agreement) wherein the requirement to return was established. The position to which return
      rights apply will be identified, and the employee will be offered assignment to it. The letter will
      also advise the employee that failure to accept the offer will result in action being initiated to pro-
      pose his or her separation for failure to accept return assignment to comply with the DoD Rotation
      Policy.
   8.3.4. Employees completing allowable overseas service with return rights at lower grade or pay
   band.
      8.3.4.1. The employee will be advised in writing of the date authorized overseas service will
      expire and of the obligation to return, citing the notification (overseas employment agreement) to
      the employee wherein the requirement to return was established. The letter will advise the
      employee of the following options:
          8.3.4.1.1. Immediate application to exercise return rights. Notify the U.S. CPF no later than 6
          months prior to the expected return date.
          8.3.4.1.2. Registration in the DoD Priority Placement Program for return placement. The let-
          ter will also advise the employee that failure to accept a position offer at the current grade or
          pay band, and at a location for which registered, may result in his or her separation from Air
          Force employment.
   8.3.5. If the employee fails to elect either available option within 7 workdays, registration in the DoD
   PPP will be affected by the CPF and the employee will be notified of that registration. Continued
58                                                                        AFMAN36-204 11 APRIL 2007


     employment (position offer) resulting from either option listed above will be made in writing. If it
     resulted from the employee’s request to exercise return rights, he or she will be advised that failure to
     accept the offer will terminate return rights and return assignment will be effected by priority place-
     ment. If it resulted from registration in DoD PPP, he or she will be advised that failure to accept the
     offer will result in action being initiated to propose his or her separation for failure to accept return
     assignment to comply with the DoD Rotation Policy.
     8.3.6. Employees Completing Allowable Foreign Service Without Return Rights.
        8.3.6.1. No later than 6 months before tour expiration date, the employee will be advised in writ-
        ing of the date authorized overseas service will expire and of the obligation to return to the U.S.,
        citing the notification (overseas employment agreement) to the employee where the requirement
        to return was established. The letter will identify DoD PPP return placement as the means by
        which such return will be effected, and advise the employee to contact the servicing CPF for spe-
        cific details. The employee will also be advised that failure to accept an offer at his or her current
        grade or pay band, and at a location for which registered, may result in his or her separation from
        Air Force employment for failure to accept return assignment to comply with the DoD rotation
        policy.
        8.3.6.2. If the employee does not register in PPP within 7 workdays of notification, registration
        will be affected by the CPF and the employee will be notified of that registration.
        8.3.6.3. A position offer resulting from such registration will be made in writing. If the offer is at
        the employee’s current grade or pay band equivalent, he or she will be advised that failure to
        accept the offer will result in action being initiated to propose his or her separation for failure to
        accept return assignment to the United States to comply with the DoD Rotation Policy.
        8.3.6.4. Employees whose early return is in the “best interests of the Air Force”. Such determina-
        tions will be proposed by the supervisor and approved/disapproved at the discretion of the Com-
        mander.
            8.3.6.4.1. The employee will be advised in writing of the decision, the reasons, and the means
            by which return is to be effected; i.e., exercise of return rights or registration in DoD PPP (if
            otherwise eligible) for priority return placement.
            8.3.6.4.2. Depending on the urgency of the situation, expanded registration may be required.
            8.3.6.4.3. Any return to a lower grade or pay band equivalent will be affected under adverse
            action procedures, if required by OPM and/or Air Force regulations.
            8.3.6.4.4. Employees whose skills do not match the overseas position. If the employee does
            not have return rights, the employee’s return will follow the procedures in paragraph 8.1.2.
            Return registration will not include the series and grade or pay band equivalent of the overseas
            position, unless options are available for which it is determined the employee is well qualified.

8.4. Failure to Request Return Assignment.
     8.4.1. Failure to request return assignment when notified that overseas service will not be extended or
     that overseas service allowable under the DoD rotation policy is completed is a breach of the overseas
     employment agreement. It will result in action to propose the employee’s removal for failure to com-
     ply with the overseas employment agreement or failure to request return assignment in accordance
     with the provisions of the DoD overseas rotation policy and the conditions implicit to his/her employ-
AFMAN36-204 11 APRIL 2007                                                                           59


  ment situation. This includes those employees from whom the agreement was not obtained, but who
  are obligated to return (see Figure 3.5.).
  8.4.2. A proposed removal will be initiated for failure to request or accept return from the overseas
  area to comply with the overseas employment agreement. A separation effected under these proce-
  dures will be no earlier than the end of the authorized period of overseas service.

                                                 Chapter 9

           RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS BETWEEN FOREIGN OVERSEAS TOURS

9.1. General Information.
     9.1.1. Air Force civilian employees must complete a 12-month residency requirement in the U.S. or a
     nonforeign area between foreign area tours. This guidance applies to those employees who have
     returned to the U.S. or a nonforeign area from a foreign area DoD assignment, as well as to employees
     or applicants who are currently in a foreign area seeking employment with the Air Force in foreign
     areas. Employees who have been in a foreign area for five or more years are not eligible for foreign
     overseas employment until having resided in the U.S. for 12 months or have received an approved
     waiver of this residency requirement. Employees with prior foreign area service should be counseled
     on the 12-month U.S. residency requirement.
     9.1.2. AFPC and CPFs counsel employees who have been in a foreign area, or who are currently in a
     foreign area, for four years or less and who have not resided in the U.S. or in a non-foreign area for 12
     months or more, that they may apply for other positions in foreign areas. However, these employees
     are ineligible for any tour which, when totaled with previous tours not interrupted by 12 months or
     more in the U.S. or nonforeign area, exceeds five years. Employees may apply for Air Force positions
     overseas any time after residing in the U.S. or nonforeign area for at least 11 months. If selected, how-
     ever, the employee cannot be appointed/assigned to the foreign area position until completion of the
     12 months of U.S. or nonforeign residency. It is essential that each applicant be carefully screened to
     ensure the employee has resided in the U.S. or nonforeign area for the minimum 11-month period.

9.2. Residency Requirement Waiver Requests.
     9.2.1. HQ USAF/A1XC may grant exceptions to the 12-month residency requirement for non-cen-
     trally managed positions on an individual case basis to permit the assignment of an employee to a
     hard-to-fill category position. The Career Field Functional Manager may grant exceptions for cen-
     trally managed Career Field positions. Waiver requests must show true management need based on (1)
     significant adverse impact on mission accomplishment if the waiver is not approved or (2) any other
     particularly urgent and unique organizational needs that are tied to the mission. The waiver request
     should also include:
        9.2.1.1. Proposed selectee’s name.
        9.2.1.2. Current position title, series, grade or pay band, organizational assignment and duty loca-
        tion.
        9.2.1.3. Position title, series and grade or pay band equivalent of position, organization assign-
        ment and duty location for which selected.
        9.2.1.4. Inclusive dates last served in a DoD position in a foreign area, position title, series, grade

                        NONDISPLACED FOREIGN OVERSEAS EMPLOYEE

10.1. PPP Registration Procedures for Nondisplaced Overseas Employees.
This attachment does not apply to displaced/nondisplaced overseas family member employees or dis-
placed overseas employees. PPP registration eligibility and procedures for nondisplaced overseas
employees are contained in the DoD PPP Operations Manual, Chapter 5.

10.2. General PPP Registration Procedures.
     10.2.1. PPP registration eligibility and time of registration is based on the length of time served on an
     overseas tour and any authorized extensions. Refer to PPP Operations Manual Chapter, 5.C.1. for reg-
     istration eligibility and Chapter 5.C.2. for the timelines.
     10.2.2. As indicated in PPP Operations Manual, Chapter 5.C.1.c., eligible employees must be avail-
     able to register in PPP within seven workdays after notification that their tour is not being extended or
     be subject to separation if no return rights exist.
     10.2.3. Complete PPP Registration/Counseling Checklist (Appendix H in PPP Operations Manual)
     for each PPP registrant and ensure it is signed by both the registrant and the registering personnelist in
     the CPF. Also ensure that registrants are counseled (and Appendix H is documented) on all automatic
     registration expansions and file maintenance requirements indicated in this appendix.
     10.2.4. Nondisplaced overseas employees successfully completing one or more overseas tours or
     those who are within six months of meeting the 5-year limitation of overseas employment with no
     specific return rights or with return rights to a lower grade or pay band equivalent are referred as a Pri-
     ority 2 to their own Component and a Priority 3 to all other Components.
     10.2.5. During the initial 90 days of registration, nondisplaced overseas employees will register for
     the minimum number of activities likely to provide job opportunity, up to and including one entire
     zone, in accordance with PPP Operations Manual, Chapter 5.C.6.a. Initial registration normally
     occurs six months prior to the employee’s DEROS.
     10.2.6. If an employee has not received a valid offer within 30 days of registration, the registration
     must be “file maintained” to include all skills (up to 5) for which the registrant is well qualified. (PPP
     Operations Manual Chapter 5.C.5.)
     10.2.7. If not placed during this 90-day period, the area of registration will be expanded to include at
     least two full zones. This expansion is an automatic action and does not require the concurrence of the
     employee. The only input required from the employee is if they request their PPP registration be lim-
     ited to Air Force activities only.
     10.2.8. Employees with return rights to a position at a lower-grade or pay band equivalent may
     remain in the PPP until they are placed, decline a valid offer, are within 30 days of their DEROS,
     renew their agreement, or are directed to return, whichever happens first. If not placed by the end of
     the authorized registration period, employees must exercise their return rights. [PPP Operations Man-
     ual Chapter 5.c.2.b.(1)]
AFMAN36-204 11 APRIL 2007                                                                              63


  10.2.9. For employees without specific return rights, the registration will automatically be expanded
  to include all DoD activities in all zones at the employee’s DEROS (or the expiration of the six-month
  registration period, whichever occurs first). There are no exceptions to this guidance. Registrants will
  be allowed to remain in PPP until they are placed, decline a valid offer, renew their agreement or are
  directed to return, whichever occurs first. [PPP Operations Manual Chapter 5.C.2.b. (2)]

  EMPLOYMENT OF NON-U.S. CITIZENS IN OVERSEAS AREAS (EXCEPT HAWAII AND
                                ALASKA).

11.1. Authority for Appointment and Employment.
     11.1.1. This chapter implements DoD 1400.25-M, Subchapter 1231, Employment of Foreign Nation-
     als.
     11.1.2. Persons who are not citizens of the U.S. may be recruited at overseas areas (except Hawaii and
     Alaska) and appointed to overseas positions without regard to competitive requirements in accordance
     with the authority provided in Civil Service Rule VIII, section 8.3. These appointments are, in gen-
     eral, made in the same manner as Schedule A, Excepted Appointments. Non-U.S. citizens can be
     employed in overseas areas in a GS/FWS position only in the absence of qualified U.S. applicants.
     Also, non-U.S. citizens must be family members of individuals who are in the country/territory on
     “official orders” from the U.S. Government.
     11.1.3. The employment and administration of non-U.S. citizens must conform to local laws, cus-
     toms, and practices, to the extent permitted by U.S. law, other federal authority, and practical manage-
     ment considerations.

11.2. Types of Appointments. All non-U.S. citizen employees are given either an Excepted or Excepted
NTE appointment, as appropriate. Appointments may be made on a full-time, part-time, or intermittent
basis. Excepted appointments are of indefinite tenure. Excepted NTE appointments are generally limited
to periods of one year or less. However, there is no restriction on making these appointments for greater
periods.

11.3. Dual Citizenship.
     11.3.1. Some countries recognize dual citizenship, but the U.S. government does not. The following
     guidance pertains to U.S. citizens who may be employed as local nationals.
        11.3.1.1. Direct Hire. There is no authority to hire a U.S. citizen as a local national into appropri-
        ated fund positions because such employment is not exempt from U.S. employment and pay laws
        and implementing regulations. Where a U.S. citizen is employed unknowingly as a local national
        and later makes known his or her U.S. citizenship, the employment must be terminated promptly
        because the employee is serving under an unauthorized appointment.
        11.3.1.2. Indirect Hire. The local government may hire a U.S. citizen under the indirect hire sys-
        tem but U.S. Forces should not refer, recommend, or encourage such employment. As U.S. citi-
        zenship could be affected by such employment, the individual should be advised to consult with
        the U.S. Embassy before accepting local indirect hire employment. Indirect hire of U.S. citizens
        should not be made in countries where local national salaries are paid by the host country.

11.4. Effect of Acquiring Citizenship.
     11.4.1. Employees appointed under 5 CFR, Section 8.3. of Rule VIII, who acquire U.S. citizenship
     during their overseas service, may continue to serve under the Excepted Appointment in the position
     occupied when citizenship is acquired. No personnel action is involved unless the person is subse-
AFMAN36-204 11 APRIL 2007                                                                                 65


   quently made subject to the General Schedule and a change in pay method category must be recorded.
   These employees may not be moved noncompetitively to other competitive positions. When the
   non-citizen appointment was to a General Schedule position, action is taken to convert the employee
   to a career-conditional appointment (applicable to Guam).
   11.4.2. A non-U.S. citizen direct hire employee who acquires U.S. citizenship is entitled to receive
   the U.S. rate of pay appropriate for the position occupied. The employee is also entitled to retirement,
   health, leave, and life insurance benefits accorded to U.S. citizen employees. Entitlement to travel and
   other allowances are determined under current criteria. The conversion to U.S. rate of pay is effected
   on SF-50, Notification of Personnel Action, as a “Pay Adjustment.” The effective date of the pay
   adjustment is the day following the date that the employee made known his or her U.S. citizenship to
   the CPF. Pay is established at the initial step rate unless a higher adjustment rate is appropriate on the
   basis of the current rate of pay.
   11.4.3. Considering that the position occupied by the employee was established and funded for occu-
   pancy by a local national and U.S. citizenship alone does not entitle an employee to continuing
   employment, a decision must be made in accordance with the following on retention of the employee:
      11.4.3.1. If manning and budget approval can be obtained for continuing occupancy of the posi-
      tion at U.S. pay rates, the employee may remain under his or her current appointment. However,
      the employee cannot be moved to another position or converted in the current position except
      under 11.4.3.3., below.
      11.4.3.2. If manning and budget approval cannot be obtained, reduction-in-force procedures must
      be applied. The employee’s type of appointment and pay would place him or her in a separate
      competitive level and no entitlement to displace or bump another employee exists.
      11.4.3.3. If the employee meets qualification and training requirements and is otherwise eligible
      for appointment under Civil Service as well as Air Force requirements, an appointment may be
      made either to the current position, if authorized under 11.4.3.1. above, or to another position.

11.5. Determination of Positions to Which Non-U.S. Citizens will be Assigned.
   11.5.1. The following factors and circumstances are considered in deciding whether to fill a position
   by a non-U.S. citizen:
      11.5.1.1. Provisions of governing treaty or agreement and view of host government, including its
      position relative to our retention of an adequate non-U.S. citizen work force in the event of mili-
      tary mobilization or national emergency.
      11.5.1.2. Availability of qualified personnel locally or in surrounding areas.
      11.5.1.3. Degree of indoctrination and training estimated to be required if locally available
      non-U.S. citizens are employed.
      11.5.1.4. Relative cost for salary, transportation and logistical support of non-U.S. and U.S. citi-
      zen personnel.
      11.5.1.5. Security requirements for individual positions.
   11.5.2. The ability to retain personnel in the event of mobilization or national emergency is signifi-
   cant in determining whether effective use can be made of non-U.S. citizen personnel. Therefore, an
   attempt must be made to ascertain the views of the host government on this point prior to making a
66                                                                       AFMAN36-204 11 APRIL 2007


     decision to employ non-U.S. citizens. Governing agreements may provide general assurance regard-
     ing the retention of the non-U.S. citizen work force under mobilization or national emergency condi-
     tions. In any event, it is advisable that implementing arrangements are developed or understandings
     reached with the host country/territory to identify the specific measures to be taken under such cir-
     cumstances.
     11.5.3. Program Development. Non-U.S. citizen programs are based on the most practicable and effi-
     cient methods of administration in each specific area, within the framework of the guidance and the
     provisions of this section. In all cases, parallel consideration must be given to the DoD and Air Force
     objectives of qualifying, as a good employer by local standards and of fulfilling management needs.
     11.5.4. Program Review. Continuing analysis and review of the personnel programs and the circum-
     stances in the local areas must be made to determine:
        11.5.4.1. Whether program improvements are required to increase effectiveness of administra-
        tion;
        11.5.4.2. Actions which can be taken within the provisions of this section to improve programs or
        alleviate problems, or;
        11.5.4.3. Need for negotiation or renegotiation of agreements. In this instance, action is initiated
        in accordance with AFM 36-203, Chapter 7, Employment of Foreign Nationals in Foreign Areas
        and DoD 1400.25-M, Subchapter 1231, Employment of Foreign Nationals. In addition, informa-
        tion on the requirements for and significant developments in negotiations must be transmitted to
        HQ USAF/A1X, 1040 Air Force Pentagon, Washington D.C. 20330-1040.
        11.5.4.4. Need for modification of, or exception to, the provisions of this section. In this case,
        information on the problems involved, alternative solutions, and recommendations are submitted
        to HQ USAF/A1X.
     11.5.5. Policies, Regulations, and Other Administrative Controls.
        11.5.5.1. Employment Conditions for Non-U.S. Citizen Personnel. Employment conditions for
        non-U.S. citizen personnel must assure that these employees are:
            11.5.5.1.1. Compensated in accordance with locally prevailing rates of pay, or rates prevailing
            in the area from which recruited.
            11.5.5.1.2. Trained as necessary to better equip them to perform their duties, to improve their
            production, and to qualify for advancement.
            11.5.5.1.3. Provided equitable consideration for advancement in responsibility and grade,
            consistent with their abilities, and assignment to higher-grade duties that do not require assign-
            ment of U.S. citizens.
            11.5.5.1.4. Governed by conditions of employment that conform with local practices, such as
            payment of bonuses, separation allowances, advance payments for vacations, payment for
            local holidays, and local leave practices. Even though benefits for non-U.S. citizen employees
            may be more generous than provided for U.S. citizen employees, they are permitted provided
            they are in the public interest and can reasonably be considered a part of the employee’s com-
            pensation. Participation in local social security programs or the purchase of pension, life and
            health insurance from private firms is also permitted. Such programs include authorization to
            make employer contributions, withhold employee deductions, and forward such funds to the
AFMAN36-204 11 APRIL 2007                                                                              67


          appropriate insurance companies. These practices are permitted in all areas where non-U.S.
          citizens are employed by the Air Force under direct-hire systems. Where legal authority for
          adoption of any practice appears questionable, submit a request for decision to HQ USAF/
          A1X.
      11.5.5.2. Local laws, customs and practices are the fundamental basis for non-U.S. citizen person-
      nel programs. DoD guidance provides that the provisions of a local national employment system
      in any one area will apply uniformly to all elements of the U.S. Forces. Thus, coordination must
      be maintained between component representatives within the host country when new or revised
      systems are under consideration.

11.6. Special Reduction-in-Force Plans.
   11.6.1. Special RIF plans may be developed for all non-U.S. citizen employees in foreign areas under
   authority of 5CFR 351.201(d). When special plans are developed and used, administrative reduc-
   tion-in-force rights given U.S. citizen employees by the Air Force do not apply, unless incorporated in
   a plan.
      11.6.1.1. Coordination. Special plans are coordinated with other DoD activities in the locality to
      assure consistency within the host country or area. Plans must not be used until this coordination
      has been completed, the plans made a matter of record, an effective date set for use, and employ-
      ees notified of the provisions of the plans.
      11.6.1.2. Requirements of Plans. Plans should be simple and easy to understand and administer.
      Provisions for recognition of veterans’ preference as a result of service in the U.S. Armed Forces,
      length of service, and type of appointment must be included. Tie breaking provisions also must be
      incorporated.

                                                  Chapter 12

                            NON-FOREIGN OVERSEAS AREA POLICIES.

12.1. Alaska.
     12.1.1. An employee on a career or career-conditional appointment who moves from the CONUS,
     Hawaii, or a U.S. territory or possession to Alaska is authorized return rights (see paragraph 7.2.).
     Return rights are retained for five years, unless extended by the former organization. This applies
     whether or not there is a transportation agreement, i.e., it also applies when the employee pays for his/
     her own travel and transportation to Alaska.
     12.1.2. IAW the overseas employment agreement (Figure 3.8. and Figure 3.9.), management may
     initiate return when it is in the best interest of the Air Force during the five-year return rights period,
     and for those without return rights, during the initial five-year overseas period.
     12.1.3. Employees assigned in Alaska who have return rights to a different location and accept an
     assignment at another overseas location, except Hawaii, continue those return rights for the remainder
     of the initial five-year return rights period.
     12.1.4. After the five-year return rights period, or any extensions thereof, employees with return
     transportation are authorized to register in the DoD Priority Placement Program (PPP) for return
     placement to CONUS as a nondisplaced employee. Under this situation, the Air Force requirement for
     automatic expansion of the geographic area of consideration is not applicable.

12.2. Guam.
     12.2.1. An employee on a career or career-conditional appointment who moves from the CONUS,
     Alaska, Hawaii, or a U.S. territory or possession to Guam is authorized return rights (see paragraph
     7.2.). Return rights are retained for five years, unless extended by the former organization. This
     applies whether or not there is a transportation agreement, i.e., it also applies when the employee pays
     for his/her own travel and transportation to Guam.
     12.2.2. IAW the overseas employment agreement (Figure 3.8. and Figure 3.9.), management may
     initiate return when it is in the best interest of the Air Force during the five-year return rights period,
     and for those without return rights, during the initial five-year overseas period.
     12.2.3. Employees assigned in Guam who have return rights to a different location and accept an
     assignment at another overseas location, except Hawaii, continue those return rights for the remainder
     of the initial five-year return rights period.
     12.2.4. After the five-year return rights period, or any extensions thereof, for employees on transpor-
     tation agreements (TAs), management has the authority not to authorize another TA. Return place-
     ment is through the DoD Priority Placement Program, where the employee remains until placed.
     Failure to request and accept return assignment through the PPP may result in the employee’s invol-
     untary separation from Air Force employment.

12.3. Hawaii.
     12.3.1. Return rights are not authorized for moves to Hawaii.
AFMAN36-204 11 APRIL 2007                                                                           69


  12.3.2. However, employees with return transportation are authorized to register in the PPP as a non-
  displaced overseas employee for return to CONUS.
  12.3.3. The Air Force requirement of automatic expansion of the area of consideration is not applica-
  ble (since employees in Hawaii earn return transportation, but are not eligible for return rights).
70                                                                        AFMAN36-204 11 APRIL 2007

                           SCHEDULE A, 213.3106(B)(6) APPOINTMENTS

13.1. Applicability and Purpose.
     13.1.1. To implement operating instructions for employment of family members of active duty mili-
     tary members and civilian employees assigned in foreign overseas areas. Refer also to DoD Instruc-
     tion 1400.23, Employment of Family Members of Active Duty Military Members and Civilian
     Employees Stationed in Foreign Areas and Air Force Pamphlet 36-508, Employment Information for
     Families Being Assigned to Overseas Areas.
     13.1.2. To promote employment opportunities for qualified family members of military and U.S. cit-
     izen civilian personnel of United States government agencies to the maximum extent possible within
     controlling appropriations, manpower resources, host nation agreements and veterans preference enti-
     tlement. This includes the conversion to the maximum extent practical of foreign national positions to
     U.S. citizen occupancy under treaty arrangement, local law, other agreements and political consider-
     ations. Providing employment opportunities also involves giving consideration to non-U.S. citizen
     third country national family members of military and U.S. citizen civilian personnel where permitted
     by host country agreements and where local tri-service agreements have been established for compen-
     sation and other employment conditions under 22 U.S.C. 3968.
     13.1.3. This section applies to, but is in addition to and separate from, the preference that a military
     spouse may be entitled to under DoD Instruction 1404.12, Employment of Spouses of Active Duty Mil-
     itary Members Stationed Worldwide.

13.2. Uses and Prohibitions.
     13.2.1. This appointing authority is designed to remove certain competitive service restrictions in fill-
     ing positions locally in foreign areas and to provide job opportunities to family members of military
     and U.S. civilian employees of U.S. government agencies. It is not restricted to family members of
     military and civilian members assigned to the area by official travel orders. Those family members
     who later are authorized logistical support are also considered “family members.” However, a family
     member must reside with the sponsor within the vicinity or commuting area of the employing activity
     to be eligible for appointment and continuous employment.
     13.2.2. This appointing authority does not apply to family members of locally hired appropriated fund
     or nonappropriated fund civilian employees or to family members with personal competitive status.
     The civilian employee’s sponsor must be on official travel orders. Additionally, this appointing
     authority does not apply to family members of personnel of the Red Cross, USO, DoD Contractors,
     AAFES concessionaires, military banking facilities or universities.
     13.2.3. Employed, unmarried children who are entitled to retain a DoD identification card and logis-
     tical support under the sponsor’s orders may continue to be employed under this authority until their
     23rd birthday or until the sponsor departs the area or completes the current period of service require-
     ment, whichever occurs sooner.
     13.2.4. The retention of a family member under this appointment authority requires that the employee
     remains a family member and the sponsor remains within the commuting area. When an employee
     ceases to be a family member or when the sponsor transfers or separates from the service, the employ-
AFMAN36-204 11 APRIL 2007                                                                               71


   ment must be terminated within two months. The appointment SF-50, Notification of Personnel
   Action, is documented to reflect the limitation on the appointment.
   13.2.5. This appointment authority is not to be used to employ locally available family member per-
   sonnel to professional staff positions in DoDEA.
