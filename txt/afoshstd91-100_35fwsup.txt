SUMMARY OF CHANGES

AFOSH STD 91-100, 01 May 1998, is supplemented as follows. The purpose of this supplement
is to add additional information to AFOSH STD 91-100, Aircraft Flight Line-Ground Operations
and Activities. Furthermore, this supplement is designed to apply specific 35 Fighter Wing
requirements in responsibilities, procedures, and operations of Hangar/Hardened Aircraft Shelter
(HAS) doors. This supplement applies to all assigned 35th Fighter Wing Personnel, aircraft and

equipment. Deviations from the procedures described herein are prohibited without written
approval of the group commander or a designated representative.

This interim change implements new guidance for the operation of the Hardened Shelter Doors
and identifies additional training required prior to operation.

6.4.5.6. (Added). The designated flight line parking area is the asphalt portion of the Hardened
Aircraft Shelter (HAS) throat extending to the taxiway, to include the asphalt portions between
the hot pit areas in the 13th and 14th Fighter Squadrons. When the hot pits are not in use, the
asphalt area adjacent to Minuteman Drive on the North side of C15, C17, C45, and C47 may also
be used.

6.4.7.1.1 (Added). Vehicles parked in designated flight line parking areas do not require
parking/flashing lights when the HAS eyebrows are illuminated. In the event the eyebrow lights
are off or inoperable, parking/flashing lights must be on. Reference 35FWI 13-202.

7.2.3.5.1. (Added). Personnel will not stand or pass through the path of opening or closing
hanger/HAS doors regardless of the direction of door movement.

7.2.3.6. (Added). Procedures for Safe Operation of Hangar/HAS Doors. All personnel assigned
to the 35th Fighter Wing that routinely access hangars/HASs will be familiar with this
supplement for hangar/HAS door responsibilities and procedures.

7.2.3.6.1. (Added). SQUADRON COMMANDERS – Squadron commanders will ensure that all
building custodians periodically check door operations IAW AFOSH Standard 91-100,
Paragraph 7.2.3.

7.2.3.6.2. (Added). MAINTENANCE TRAINING FLIGHT (MTF) – Provide all personnel in
the aircraft maintenance organizations awareness training. Initial training will be provided
during Mission Orientation (course code 029003), and recurring training will be conducted
during Annual Block Training (course code 29110). This annual training will capture those
individuals who come due for their three year refresher training. This will include HAS doors as
well as hangar doors for buildings 905, 909, 911, 949, 3130, and 3280. IMDS course codes
029003 and 29110 will be utilized to show compliance of training for personnel. This training
will be documented through IMDS.

7.2.3.6.3. (Added). FACILITY MANAGERS/FLIGHT CHIEFS-Buildings other than mentioned
in paragraph 7.2.3.6.2. with doors, other than personnel doors, that pose a potential risk to
personnel or equipment will be evaluated by the facility manager/flight chief with assistance
from Ground Safety. Facility managers for HASs will ensure the operating checklist is available
and posted at each electric hangar/shelter door control panel. Facility Managers will ensure that
anyone requiring access to the HASs or hangars (i.e. contractors/visitors) are provided awareness
training on the hazards of the area.

7.2.3.6.4. (Added). CIVIL ENGINEERING – Civil Engineering will ensure that a preventative
maintenance inspection program is incorporated for powered HAS doors and non-powered
hangar doors. This will include annual inspections as a minimum. All maintenance and
inspections are accomplished by contract. The contractor is responsible for training and safety of
AFOSHSTD91-100_35FWSUP 9 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                        3


his personnel. The 35 CES/CEOHS section will ensure that all CE personnel performing duties
in the hangars or HASs are provided awareness/hands-on training prior to performing duties in
these areas. Once trained, these individuals will be approved by the squadron commander.

*7.2.3.6.5.Maintenance Personnel Prior to operating hangar/HAS doors all personnel will
complete awareness and hands-on training. Personnel will receive hands-on training through
their work center as part of their Job Safety Training. Maintenance personnel performing duties
in hangars or HASs will be familiar with AFI 21-101_COMBATAIRFORCESUP_1, paragraph
14.52, AFOSHSTD 91-100, Chapter 7 and AFOSHSTD 91-100_35FWSUP_1. Trained door
operators must reference and comply with the 35 MXG HAS Door Operating Instructions posted
on or near each door control panel. Pre-operational checks are completed prior to door operation.
If any pre-operation steps check bad, do not operate doors, attach unserviceable condition tag to
the panel and report the discrepancy to the Production Superintendent and the Facility manager.

7.2.3.6.6. (Added). OPERATIONS GROUP PERSONNEL – Personnel assigned to this group
who do not attend Maintenance Orientation/Block Training but routinely require access into the
hangars/HASs are required to receive awareness training as a minimum. This training will be
provided every three years at a minimum and will be documented on an AF Form 55, or an
approved automated system. If their duties require operating HAS doors, they are required to
complete hands-on training. MTF will assist with providing a Plan of Instruction (POI) and a
copy of the most current slide presentation.

7.2.3.6.7. (Added). OTHERS – Sections who provide their own training (e.g. Awareness and
Hands-On Training). Sections who provide their own hangar/HAS training, and do not attend
Maintenance Orientation and Block training for hangar/shelter door operations, are required to
update their training products (POI and slide presentation) every three years with the MTF. This
training will be documented on the AF Form 797 and/or through the Training Business Area
(TBA).

7.2.5.1. (Added). Vehicle operators will sound horn, proceed slowly (under 5 mph) when
entering or exiting a hangar/HAS. Spotters must be used when passing through partially open
hangar/HAS doors, unless at least 5 feet of clearance exists on each side of the vehicle.
