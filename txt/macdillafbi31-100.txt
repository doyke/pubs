1. Requirements.
    1.1. Personnel requiring unescorted entry into a restricted area will be provided Phase I
    security education by the assigned security manager. The Phase I training must include a
    review of the 6th Air Mobility Wing (6 AMW) Operation Plan (OPLAN) 31-101,
    Installation Security Plan; methods for contacting the Base Defense Operations Center
    (BDOC); restricted area entry circulation control procedures, including verification of the
    right and need to be in a restricted area; responsibilities and duties of a visitor escort; and
    tricks that may be used to gain unauthorized entry to restricted areas.
2. Security Education and Training (SET) Program.
    2.1. Jump Start Training, a computer web-based tool, provides the Installation Security
    Constable Briefing to all newly assigned personnel. Jump Start is a combination of the Right
    Start briefing and base in-processing procedures.
    2.2. Phase I, Orientation Training, as listed in AFI 31-101, paragraph 7.2.2., will be
    accomplished during indoctrination training by the unit security managers.
    2.3. Phase II, Continuation Training, as listed in AFI 31-101, paragraph 7.2.3., will be
    accomplished by individual units and the Installation Security Constable.
       2.3.1. The Installation Security Constable will work closely with each unit to ensure they
       have current training materials and tests to evaluate their personnel. The Installation
       Security Constable must physically go to the work centers to visit with personnel before
       and after training to continue awareness training and validate the effectiveness of the unit
       level training. Individual units will be responsible for conducting training on the
       following items as a minimum:
           2.3.1.1. Information on threats to USAF protection level resources.
           2.3.1.2. Security procedures for restricted and controlled areas.
           2.3.1.3. Duress words and authentication procedures.
           2.3.1.4. Written knowledge tests (test results should be forwarded to the Installation
           Security Constable on an annual basis as determined by the Chief of Security Forces
           (CSF)).
           2.3.1.5. All units from the installation whose personnel work with or around
           protection level resources, or in protection level restricted and controlled areas, will
           conduct Phase II Continuation Training as part of their ancillary training program.
           This training must be tailored to the specific duties of their work centers.
       2.3.2. Installation Security Constable will conduct as a minimum:
           2.3.2.1. Visits to each restricted area work center twice per year.
           2.3.2.2. Detection exercises to determine the effectiveness of the training program.
MACDILLAFBI31-100 12 APRIL 2010                                                                  3


  2.4. Detection exercises will be tailored to meet the needs of the individual units. The
  Installation Security Council (ISC) has directed one exercise per quarter for units, other than
  6th Security Forces Squadron (6 SFS), working flight line operations.
     2.4.1. Guidelines for SET exercises.
         2.4.1.1. The exercise must be coordinated with the BDOC and Maintenance
         Operations Center (MOC) to prevent confusion and/or interference with real world
         incidents.
         2.4.1.2. Give a detailed briefing on the exercise scenario.
             2.4.1.2.1. Give perpetrators exact actions you want them to take.
             2.4.1.2.2. Identify the work center or area where the exercise will be conducted.
         2.4.1.3. Discuss the specific objectives of the scenario.
             2.4.1.3.1. Give the perpetrator(s) instructions on information gathering (names,
             unit, and actions taken or not taken by exercise participants).
         2.4.1.4. Discuss the time limit of the exercise.
             2.4.1.4.1. Specific times should be planned and adhered to.
             2.4.1.4.2. SET exercises may be delayed pending real-world activities and
             continued as deemed necessary.
         2.4.1.5. Give detailed instructions on the action to take to include a detailed safety
         briefing for all.
             2.4.1.5.1. Perpetrators must obey instructions.
             2.4.1.5.2. Perpetrators may not commit seemingly hostile acts.
             2.4.1.5.3. Perpetrators will not use physical violence.
         2.4.1.6. Safety of personnel will be in the forefront of everyone’s mind and
         stringently enforced at all times. All exercises will be immediately terminated if a
         potentially dangerous situation exists. If such a situation is recognized by
         anyone involved or witnessing the exercise, the word “SAFETY” will be voiced
         to immediately terminate the exercise. At no time will perpetrators carry actual
         weapons.
  2.5. The grading scale for all SET exercises will be ―
                                                       mission ready - GREEN,‖ ―  ready with
  comments that require action or attention – YELLOW,‖ or ― not mission ready - RED.‖
  2.6. The advertisement “EXERCISE” will precede and follow the initial exercise
  communication for radio/telephone transmissions and will be used frequently throughout the
  exercise.
  2.7. After all exercises, the Installation Security Constable will conduct a critique to give
  positive feedback on lessons learned. If a unit or work center fails a SET exercise, a re-
  evaluation with similar circumstances must be conducted after 30 calendar days, but no
  longer than 60 days from the date of the failure.
4                                                       MACDILLAFBI31-100 12 APRIL 2010


    2.8. A memorandum will be sent to the unit commander of the failure and forwarded back to
    the Installation Security Constable. The memorandum will contain the exercise scenario,
    actions during exercise, desired response for the exercise, and follow-up actions.
    2.9. Training and test results will be maintained for one year by unit security managers and
    reviewed by the Installation Security Constable on an annual basis. The Installation Security
    Constable briefs the ISC on the overall assessment of security awareness for the installation
    based on the training and testing results.
3. Security Protection Levels.
    3.1. Protection Level 1: Highest priority. Applies to weapons systems on alert status for
    direct enemy engagement, all nuclear weapons in the USAF arsenal, and components of
    tactical command/control/warning facilities (Example: None assigned to MacDill AFB).
    3.2. Protection Level 2: Second highest priority. Applies to the major components of
    weapons systems that are not on alert status but are on bases and sites from which they could
    be launched for direct strikes against or engagement with the enemy (Example:
    AWACS/KC-135 on alert).
    3.3. Protection Level 3: Third highest priority. Applies to combat aircraft and missiles that
    cannot be considered in place by virtue of their present location. It also applies to logistics,
    air commando, reconnaissance, and the like aircraft designated for direct support of engaged
    combat forces or required to sustain operations in general limited war (Example: KC-135/C-
    37).
    3.4. Protection Level 4: Lowest priority. Controlled areas: Areas not meeting the above
    criteria but requiring additional security measures (Example: Base Defense Operations
    Center (BDOC)/Pharmacies/Armories).
4. Security Terms and Definitions.
    4.1. Restricted Area: A legally established military zone under USAF jurisdiction into
    which persons may not enter without specific authorization. This authorization comes from
    the Installation Commander (in accordance with AFI 31-101). Restricted areas contain
    operational resources such as the Command Post or Protection Level 1, 2, or 3 aircraft. The
    use of deadly force in these areas is authorized by Security Forces personnel (in accordance
    with AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel).
       4.1.1. Restricted area boundaries: They are identified by raised barriers or a 4-6 inch red
       stripe painted on the concrete and restricted area signs posted every 100 feet. If a
       building or room is a restricted area, all doors will be marked with restricted area signs.
       4.1.2. Entry Control Point (ECP): ECPs are marked by a 20‖ x 10‖ white box with Entry
       Control written in black letters. Personnel may only enter restricted areas via established
       ECPs.
    4.2. HELPING HAND: An unclassified message. BDOC reports to the installation
    command post of an unusual incident, possibly hostile, that affects a Protection Level
    resource. Examples include an incident where an individual enters the restricted area
    somewhere other than an established entry control point, or discovering an individual inside
    the restricted area without a restricted area badge and not under proper escort.
MACDILLAFBI31-100 12 APRIL 2010                                                                 5


   4.3. COVERED WAGON: An unclassified message. BDOC reports to the installation
   command post of an unusual incident, probable or actually hostile, that affects a Protection
   Level resource. A COVERED WAGON report could result from an upgrading of a
   HELPING HAND based on investigation of the Security Response Team. It can also result
   if an event is serious enough to immediately suspect enemy action. Examples include an
   unauthorized individual tampering with an aircraft or an individual on the flight line with the
   intent of causing some type of harm to a protection level resource.
   4.4. FORCE PROTECTION CONDITION ALERTING MESSAGE: An unclassified down-
   channel telephone message from Major Command Headquarters (HQ) or HQ USAF that
   recommends or orders the implementation of a Force Protection Condition (FPCON). This
   alerting message will remain in effect until terminated by the originating or higher authority.
5. Entry Control Card.
   5.1. The AF Form 1199CD, USAF Entry Control Card (AFECC), serves as an official
   document issued to a person who has been granted unescorted entry authority into a restricted
   area assigned to MacDill AFB.
   5.2. There are currently five numbers and two letter designations open on the MacDill
   AFECC.
      5.2.1. Area #1: MacDill Command Post (MCP).
      5.2.2. Area #2: Crisis Action Team (CAT).
      5.2.3. Area #3: Generation/Alert Aircraft Area. This will alleviate the need for entry
      authority lists (EAL) to be generated during the generation phase of 8010. Aircrew EALs
      will still be needed once the aircraft are cocked-on.
      5.2.4. Area #4: Mass Parking Area/Aircraft Maintenance Hangars and temporary
      Protection Level 3 restricted areas.
      5.2.5. Area #9: Earth Satellite Terminal.
      5.2.6. Letter K: Flightline Control Area.
      5.2.7. Letter T: Non-Nuclear Munitions Storage Area.
   5.3. Wear of the AFECC: The AFECC will be worn above the waist of your outermost
   garment and be in plain view when inside a restricted area. The AFECC will be secured to
   the wearer by means of an alligator clip, armband, parachute cord, or similar device.
      5.3.1. Ensure the AFECC is removed and secured from view upon departing the
      restricted area or within close proximity of an aircraft during engine run.
      5.3.2. If the bearer is asked to surrender his or her badge for inspection by a flight line
      worker with a valid AFECC or a Security Forces member, he or she will do so
      immediately.
      5.3.3. It is the bearer’s responsibility to ensure that not only themselves, but others
      around them are properly displaying their AFECC.
      5.3.4. If an AFECC is lost, stolen, or mutilated, the bearer must contact their unit
      security manager immediately to accomplish the proper actions.
6                                                   MACDILLAFBI31-100 12 APRIL 2010


       5.3.4.1. The bearer must account for their AFECC at all times.
    5.3.5. The bearer may not rely on another individual to escort them into or around the
    restricted area if they are not in possession of their AFECC. Escorting procedures are set
    up for personnel who may have limited access to the areas, not personnel who fail to
    secure their entry control card.
       5.3.5.1. Controlled/Restricted Area Escort: All individuals issued unescorted entry
       authority to Area 4 are authorized to escort individuals into the restricted area. The
       person providing the escort and escorted individual must be within sight at all times.
       The individual escorting is accountable for the escorted individual’s actions while
       they are in the restricted area. Individuals deemed escort qualified by the owner/user
       unit commander may provide escort to personnel into controlled areas. The
       individual providing escort must maintain positive control of all personnel being
       escorted and provide accountability via the AF Form 1109, Visitor Register Log.
       5.3.5.2. All photography in or around restricted areas or Protection Level resources
       within the legal confines of MacDill AFB is prohibited unless coordinated as outlined
       below. Owner/user and Security Forces will stay alert to identify any unofficial
       photography, filming, or audio recordings.
       5.3.5.3. Official Public Affairs Tours:
           5.3.5.3.1. Public Affairs (6 AMW/PA) will coordinate the dates and locations of
           all official base tours with the below listed agencies to ensure no classified actions
           are in progress:
               5.3.5.3.1.1. Agency to be photographed.
               5.3.5.3.1.2. Security Forces Operations (6 SFS/S3).
               5.3.5.3.1.3. Airfield Management, 6th Operations Support Squadron (6
               OSS/OSAA).
               5.3.5.3.1.4. MacDill Command Post (MCP).
           5.3.5.3.2. News media personnel photographing on MacDill AFB must be
           escorted by Public Affairs personnel at all times.
           5.3.5.3.3. Public Affairs personnel are responsible for the control of all personnel
           on the tour.
       5.3.5.4. Non-Public Affairs Tours:
           5.3.5.4.1. Personnel wanting to take photographs when not on an official Public
           Affairs tour must coordinate all requests through Base Operations.
           5.3.5.4.2. Base Operations will coordinate the dates and locations of all
           photographic activities with the below listed agencies to ensure no classified
           actions are in progress:
               5.3.5.4.2.1. Agency to be photographed.
               5.3.5.4.2.2. Security Forces Operations (6 SFS/S3).
               5.3.5.4.2.3. Airfield Management (6 OSS/OSAA).
MACDILLAFBI31-100 12 APRIL 2010                                                               7


                5.3.5.4.2.4. MacDill Command Post (MCP).
         5.3.5.5. Once clearance has been coordinated, Base Operations will issue the
         requester a locally produced ― photo pass‖ and brief the individual on authorized areas
         to photograph and flight line security procedures.
6. HELPING HAND/COVERED WAGON Reporting Procedures.
  6.1. Alertness: All personnel inside the restricted area must know who and what is going on
  around them at all times. Everyone must look for unauthorized personnel.
     6.1.1. As an individual is approached in a restricted area, their AFECC must be
     displayed in accordance with paragraph 4.3.
     6.1.2. If the individual has an AFECC, but is not recognized as a co-worker, they should
     be checked further by asking questions about the AFECC, why they are in the area,
     where they work, and may even be asked for other credentials to verify the information
     on their AFECC. Security Forces will check for variations in height and weight when
     conducting entry control. Variations of more than 1 inch and 10 pounds should be flags
     for entry controllers to question the authenticity of the AFECC.
  6.2. Detection: All personnel inside the restricted area must look for abnormal conditions on
  or around equipment they work with, such as cut wires, fuel leakage, missing batteries, and
  boxes or containers unattended around surrounding equipment. Individuals entering through
  unauthorized entry points to a restricted area could very well be attempting to cause serious
  damage to valuable resources.
  6.3. Sound the Alarm:
     6.3.1. Manual HELPING HAND/COVERED WAGON Reporting Signals:
         6.3.1.1. Daylight Hours: Personnel will wave their headgear or hand over their head
         in a circular motion and shout, ―
                                         HELPING HAND‖ or ―      COVERED WAGON,‖ as
         applicable.
         6.3.1.2. Hours of darkness: Personnel will wave a flashlight in a circular motion and
         shout, ―HELPING HAND‖ or ―    COVERED WAGON,‖ as applicable.
     6.3.2. If any individuals hear a HELPING HAND alarm, they should temporarily drop
     what they are doing, safety permitting, and assist.
     6.3.3. One individual should then run to the nearest telephone or radio equipped vehicle
     and report the incident and location to the BDOC at Commercial 813-828-3322/23/24.
     6.3.4. If a security response team is in the area and readily available, they should be
     requested for assistance.
  6.4. Detain and keep the suspect at a disadvantage.       Use voice commands to halt the
  suspect(s) and keep them in place.
     6.4.1. Keep their hands above their head and feet spread to ensure the safety of you,
     others, and the resource.
8                                                      MACDILLAFBI31-100 12 APRIL 2010


       6.4.2. DO NOT get involved in a physical confrontation with a suspect. If the suspect(s)
       fails to heed a challenge or departs the vicinity, keep them under observation until they
       can no longer be seen.
       6.4.3. Relay all pertinent information to BDOC or responding patrols.
7. Force Protection Conditions (FPCON).
    7.1. FPCONs are implemented when a threat, based on current intelligence or circumstances,
    indicates that a period of increased threat exists toward base resources, facilities, or
    personnel.
    7.2. Any threat condition may be implemented at any time by the Installation Commander.
    7.3. Terrorist Force Protection Conditions are separated into the following categories:
       7.3.1. FPCON Normal: Normal security operations.
       7.3.2. FPCON Alpha: Declared as a general warning of possible terrorist activity, of
       which the nature and extent are unpredictable.
       7.3.3. FPCON Bravo: Declared when there is an increased and more predictable threat
       of terrorist activity even though no particular target has been identified.
       7.3.4. FPCON Charlie: Declared when an incident occurs or when intelligence
       indicates that some form of terrorist action is imminent.
       7.3.5. FPCON Delta: Declared in the immediate area where a terrorist act has occurred
       or when intelligence has been received that terrorist action against a specific location is
       likely.
8. Methods That Might Be Used to Gain Unauthorized Entry into a Restricted Area.
    8.1. One method to gain unauthorized entry is simply walking into the restricted area, hoping
    no one will bother to question the need to be in the area.
    8.2. Another method is the use of a bogus AFECC. Examples are homemade badges, and
    lost or stolen badges that may/may not been altered.
    8.3. Stopping an individual without an AFECC, the unauthorized person may state they lost
    their AFECC or simply forgot it. If the identification cannot be verified, detain the
    individual and contact Security Forces for assistance.
9. Forms Adopted. AF 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; AF Form 1199, Air
Force Entry Control Card (AFECC); AF Form 1109, Visitor Register Log.
