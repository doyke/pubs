                                           Chapter 1

 CHARACTERIZATION UNIT (CU) & EXPLOITATION UNIT (EU) INTERACTIONS

1.1. General.
   1.1.1. The 15th Operations Support Squadron Weather Flight (15 OSS/OSW) provides
   and/or arranges for weather support to the 15th Wing (15 WG), 154th Wing (154 WG), 647th
   Air Base Group (647 ABG), subordinate units, and units assigned, attached, or supported by
   15th Wing. The 15 OSS/OSW is commonly referred to as the Weather Flight (WF)
   throughout this document, and is the focal point for all weather-related issues in support of
   Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam (JBPH-H) airfield operations. This instruction will be
   reviewed and revised no greater than biennially or in accordance with (IAW) host/parent unit
   procedures if the time is less than biennially.
   1.1.2. The 17th Operational Weather Squadron (17 OWS) at JBPH-H, HI is considered the
   CU. Characterization encompasses the “collect, analyze and predict” weather core
   competencies. Characterization depends on Air Force Weather’s ability to collect accurate
   data, correctly analyze that data, and use the results to produce a coherent picture of the
   present and future state of the air and space environment. CU’s primary responsibility is to
   produce and disseminate authoritative products that specify the past, current, and future state
   of the atmosphere for their respective geographic/functional area of responsibility (AOR).
   1.1.3. The WF is considered EU. Exploitation is the ability to minimize the impact of
   environmental threats to friendly forces while simultaneously capitalizing on environmental
   conditions that maximize the operational advantage over enemy forces. EUs tailor the
   characterization provided by the CU. Tailoring is the extraction of data that is pertinent to a
   specific mission profile from the overall characterization of the air and space environment.
   Tailoring does not mean changing the characterization. To the greatest extent possible EUs
   will use the characterized data provided to them.
1.2. Concept of Operations.
   1.2.1. The 17 OWS at JBPH-H, HI, provides regional and operational-level weather products
   and information to Air Force and Army units to successfully plan and execute United States
   Pacific Command (USPACOM) military operations.
   1.2.2. Meteorological Watch (METWATCH). METWATCH is a deliberate, continuous
   process for monitoring terrestrial weather or the space environment in an area or region. The
   purpose of a METWATCH is to identify when and where observed conditions significantly
   diverge from forecast conditions, determine courses of action to update or amend a forecast
   product or group of products, and notify designated agencies. The 17 OWS performs a
   continuous METWATCH for JBPH-H. WF personnel act as the “eyes forward” for the 17
   OWS by providing immediate feedback on current or short-term anticipated changes in
   weather conditions.
   1.2.3. The WF is the primary source of tailored weather services in support of the 15 WG,
   154 WG, 647 ABG, various headquarters elements, and visiting aircrews. The WF will make
   every effort to ensure that mission-limiting weather is anticipated and exploited, and that
   safety and Resource Protection (RP) are maintained.
 6                                                                15WGI15-101 9 JULY 2014


1.3. Responsibilities.
     1.3.1. General responsibilities of the 17 OWS and WF are outlined in AFI 15-128.
        1.3.1.1. The 17 OWS issues forecast weather warnings and watches, and may provide
        flight weather briefings to transient aircrews passing through JBPH-H. The OWS will
        issue observed warnings and advisories when the WF is closed.
        1.3.1.2. The WF issues all observed advisories and warnings when the WF is open.
        1.3.1.3. The WF will create Mission Weather Products (MWPs) that fuse theater scale
        products with local mission requirements to enable the direct inject of weather impacts
        into warfighter planning and/or execution. Upon request, the WF will provide flight
        weather briefings and operational weather support for the 15 WG and 154 WG and
        transient aircrews IAW the WF duty priorities listed in Table 1.1
     1.3.2. JBPH-H Installation Data Page. The 17 OWS and WF will coordinate and maintain a
     JBPH-H Installation Data Page detailing Watch, Warning, and Advisory (WWA) thresholds,
     desired lead times, mission impacts, unit information, Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET)
     back-up contacts and local outage back-up information.
     1.3.3. Eyes Forward & Collaboration. The WF will act as the eyes forward for the 17 OWS
     by relaying significant, time-sensitive meteorological information not found in coded
     meteorological reports to the assist in forecast operations.
1.4. Duty Priorities. IAW AFMAN 15-129V2, paragraph 1.3.3.1, the WF has created the
following duty priorities based on 15 WG mission requirements.
15WGI15-101 9 JULY 2014                                                                          7

     1.5.1. WF. Airfield and mission services will generally be provided 24 hours a day, 7 days a
     week through the combined support of the WF and 17 OWS. Normal published airfield and
     mission services hours of operations are Monday-Friday from 0400L-2200L or end of local
     flying and closed during the weekends, holidays, and Pacific Air Force (PACAF) family days
     (except during local flying). In addition, WF personnel will be on duty when SWAP has
     been activated as outlined in paragraph 2.8.2 and will stand up operations as directed by the
     15 WG/CC. Staff services are available during normal duty hours (0730-1630L) or as
     required. A web-based aircrew-briefing terminal is located in base operations, Flight
     Planning Room. This briefing terminal allows aircrews to self-brief or schedule a flight
     weather briefing from the 17 OWS.
        1.5.1.1. During times when no flying is scheduled and no significant weather is
        expected, the Duty Forecaster may go on on-call (standby). Prior to closing the station,
        the Duty Forecaster is responsible for contacting the 17 OWS, 15 Wing Command Post
        (15 WG/CP), 154 Wing Command Post (154 WG/CP), Hickam Ramp Facility (HRF)
        (i.e., Ground Tower), and Airfield Management and will be reachable via the on-call cell
        phone (published with 15 WG/CP). The weather technician will not leave the work
        center until all agencies have been notified.

1.6. Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP). Continuity of support to the installation is
susceptible to communication outages at the 17 OWS and WF.
     1.6.1. WF COOP and WF AOL. In the event of a building evacuation, the WF will move to
     building 2050 (Hickam Base Operations), first floor, room 101, Commercial (808) 448-6951
     / DSN (315) 448-6951. WF members will follow duty-specific standard operating
     procedures (SOPs) and evacuation checklists (including a list of required back-up equipment)
     and resume services at the AOL as soon as possible. The flight will continue operational
     support and resume eyes forward responsibilities for the OWS. Most WF services/support
     will be provided, but will require a case-by-case assessment depending on communication
     line status, equipment status, etc. Expect some services to be somewhat degraded (e.g.,
     weather products, pilot briefings, etc.) due to limited facilities and loss of dedicated data
     services, including sensors and various data types (e.g., meteorological satellite (METSAT),
     radar imagery, etc.). For flight safety reasons, the WF will not evacuate during exercises;
     however will exercise AOL operations annually.
     1.6.2. 17 OWS COOP.
        1.6.2.1. For short term outages (< 24 hours) and during normal duty hours, the WF will
        assume local weather watch, warning and advisory responsibility. If after duty hours, the
        17 OWS will contact the on-call forecaster who will initiate COOP procedures.

                                   AIRFIELD SERVICES

2.1. General. Airfield services include those actions affecting Hickam Field Air Operations
(defined within 5 Nautical Miles (NM) of the airfield).
2.2. Observations. Surface weather observations are fundamental to all meteorological
services. Observations are the basic information upon which forecasts and warnings are made in
support of a wide range of weather sensitive activities within the public and private sectors.
   2.2.1. Equipment. The Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS) program is a joint
   effort of the National Weather Service (NWS), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA),
   and the Department of Defense (DOD). The ASOS systems serve as the nation's primary
   surface weather observing network. ASOS is designed to support weather forecast activities
   and aviation operations and, at the same time, support the needs of the meteorological,
   hydrological, and climatological research communities.
   2.2.2. Responsibilities. For Hickam Field Air Operations, the FAA is responsible for weather
   observations at Hickam Field/Honolulu International Airport (IAP) 24 hours a day, 7 days a
   week, and 365 days a year. A certified, contracted observer augments, as necessary, the
   ASOS and provides backup when required.
   2.2.3. Guidance. The FAA surface weather observer program is a component of the
   National Airspace System (NAS). It combines with other elements of the NAS to ensure the
   overall safety of air transportation services. Specific guidance governing the FAA for
   observing services is outlined in Joint Order (JO) 7900.5C - Surface Weather Observing.
   2.2.4. Purpose. It prescribes aviation surface weather observing procedures and practices for
   both manual and automated observation locations and includes practices and procedures for
   augmentation of automated observations and backup information in the event of system
   failure, erroneous or non-representative data, and limitations. The practices and procedures
   set forth in this order apply to all FAA personnel, FAA-contract personnel, and non-Federal
   Observer personnel who provide aviation weather observation services. The following
   observations are created and disseminated utilizing the International Civil Aviation
   Organization (ICAO) identifier PHNL:
       2.2.4.1. Meteorological Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR). A METAR is a
       measurement or evaluation of meteorological elements that describe the state of the
       atmosphere at the surface location(s) where the observation is taken. METAR is a
       scheduled observation. The METAR is the primary observation code used in the United
       States to satisfy requirements for reporting surface meteorological data. It contains a
       report of wind, visibility, runway visual range (RVR) (where connected), weather, sky
       condition, temperature, dew point, and altimeter setting (collectively referred to as "the
       body of the report"). In addition, coded plain language information that elaborates on the
       data in the body of the report may be appended to the METAR or Aviation Selected
       Special Weather Report (SPECI). This significant information is referred to as "remarks."
       At Manual Observations and augmented stations, the METAR may be abridged to
       include one or more of the above elements. METAR observations that also meet the
15WGI15-101 9 JULY 2014                                                                        11


       criteria for a SPECI observation are called SPECI observations. For specific elements,
       please refer to JO 7900.5C - Surface Weather Observing.
       2.2.4.2. SPECI. A SPECI is a weather observation that is reported at other than a
       scheduled time. SPECI must be taken when any of the criteria for a special observation is
       observed or detected. A SPECI observation must contain the elements in a METAR, plus
       additional coded or plain language information that elaborates on the data in the body of
       the report. The SPECI criteria are applicable only to stations that have the capability of
       evaluating the event. All SPECI must be taken as soon as possible after relevant criteria
       are observed. For specific elements, please refer to JO 7900.5C - Surface Weather
       Observing.

   2.2.6. Limitations. For the exception of requesting an observation involving an aircraft
   mishap, the WF has no command authority over the submitted content, dissemination, or
   submitting organization for official airfield observing services.
2.3. Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF). TAFs are a critical element of NWS aviation
weather services because they are a key product in decisions for flight planning and for aircraft
movement within the NAS.
   2.3.1. Responsibilities. The NWS produces the official TAF for Honolulu IAP which is
   connected to Hickam Field Air Operations through the Honolulu Forecast Office. Four
   forecasts are issued daily at 0000Z (1400L), 0600Z (2000L), 1200Z (0200L), and 1800Z
   (0800L), each covering a 30-hour period under the ICAO identifier PHNL. Additionally,
   each TAF issued will be amended three hours after the initial forecast is issued (NWS
   mandatory requirement). Each TAF specifies the time of occurrence to the nearest hour,
   duration and intensity (if applicable) of weather conditions expected to occur.
   2.3.2. Guidance. The Honolulu Forecast Office is governed by NWS Instruction 10-813,
   Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts. A complete TAF will include a forecast of surface wind
   (speed and direction), surface visibility, weather, obstructions to vision (if any), clouds (or
   vertical visibility into a surface-based obscuration), Low Level Wind Shear (LLWS), and any
   expected significant change(s) to one or more of these elements during the specified time
   period.
   2.3.3. Purpose. Aviation forecasts in TAF code provide meteorological information for
   flight planning and command and control activities for a specific aerodrome complex. All
   NWS Weather Forecast Office (WFO) forecasters must be fully qualified to produce aviation
   products, regardless of grade. Workload often requires aviation forecasts be issued by any
   forecaster on shift, not just a designated “aviation forecaster”.

   2.3.5. Limitations. The WF has no command authority over the submitted content,
   dissemination, or submitting organization for official airfield forecasting services.
2.4. Resource Protection (RP) Support. The 17 OWS conducts a continuous meteorological
watch to identify and assess emerging and imminent threats to JBPH-H and Hickam Field Air
Operations. Watches and warnings provide notice of weather events posing a hazard to life or
property. Advisories provide specific notice to an operational agency of environmental
phenomena with the potential to impact operations. Customer responses to WWAs are listed in
Attachment 4.
   2.4.1. Responsibilities. The overall goal is to provide the best possible resource protection to
   Hickam Field Air Operations.
        2.4.1.1. 17 OWS. The 17 OWS is responsible for issuing Special Weather Statements
        (SWS) and all FORECAST Watches, Warnings, and Advisories. Watches, Warnings,
        and Advisories are special notices provided by the 17 OWS resulting from both the
        forecast and METWATCH processes to assist military decision makers associated with
        Hickam Field Air Operations with resource and RP decisions. If the WF is closed,
        observed advisories and warnings will be issued by the 17 OWS if they have the
        capability to remotely monitor the observed advisory or warning criteria.
        2.4.1.2. WF. The WF acts as the “eyes forward” for the 17 OWS and is responsible for
        issuing all Hickam Field Air Operations OBSERVED warnings and advisories. The WF
        can issue any forecast warning if there is an immediate threat to life and/or property. In
        these cases, the WF will back-brief the 17 OWS when time permits and will also be
        responsible for disseminating the information to locally supported agencies. If the WF is
        closed, they will keep a forecaster on-call for resource protection actions (e.g., SWAP).
   2.4.2. Special Weather Statements (SWS). SWSs are special notices issued by the 17 OWS
   to assist military decision makers with RP decisions.
        2.4.2.1. SWSs provide advance notice of widespread hazardous weather conditions that
        have the potential to affect military installation(s) and is a stand-alone product normally
        issued 48-72 hours in advance of the forecast event. SWS will be an alphanumeric (A/N)
        product, or may also include a graphical depiction, describing the type, onset, duration,
        and area impacted by the event and will be disseminated via common user
        communications.
        2.4.2.2. OWSs will communicate the potential of significant weather events to supported
        WFs (as applicable) for evaluation, prior to dissemination of SWSs to the WF’s
        supported parent/host unit(s).
   2.4.3. Weather Watches.        A weather watch is a special notice to installation
   personnel/supported units of a potential for environmental conditions of such intensity as to
15WGI15-101 9 JULY 2014                                                                      13


   pose a hazard to life or property. They are used by installation personnel/supported units to
   make force protection and risk management decisions. Watches are issued outlining a 5NM
   radius of Hickam Field Air Operations and are defined in Table 2.3 Note: Watches, except
   lightning and tornado, funnel cloud, or waterspout will not be issued when Hickam Field Air
   Operations or JBPH-H is in Tropical Cyclone Conditions of Readiness (TCCOR) 1.

    Surface winds ≥ 25 knots but < 35 knots                                          30
   2.4.6. WWA Numbering Scheme. Advisories, watches, and warnings are numbered
   consecutively by identifying the type of weather message (watch, warning, or advisory)
   followed by a five-digit number. The first two numbers indicate the current month while the
   second three numbers indicate the sequence number. For example, the message “Weather
   Warning 02-005” means the month is February (02) and this is the fifth (005) warning issued
   in the month. The message “Weather Advisory 12-013” means the month is December (12)
   and this is the thirteenth (013) advisory issued in the month. Examples of different messages
   are contained in Attachment 3.
   2.4.7. WWA Upgrades/Downgrades. WWAs will be upgraded (i.e., winds increase from 35
   knots to 50 knots) or downgraded as required. Upgrades should meet the desired lead times
   specified in Tables 2.3, 2.4, and 2.7. Only one warning will be in effect at a given time (and
   will include multiple warning criteria as required) except for forecast tornado warnings
   and/or observed lightning warnings. Tornado and lightning will be separate warnings. With
   the exception of tornado and lightning warnings, if a warning is issued for one criteria and it
   becomes necessary to warn for another criteria, a new warning and new number will be
 16                                                               15WGI15-101 9 JULY 2014


   issued, to include all criteria expected. A separate valid time may be specified for each
   criteria if necessary.
   2.4.8. WWA Amendments. When WWAs no longer adequately describe the phenomenon's
   expected occurrence, a completely new WWA with a new number will be issued. The
   amendment will clearly state how the amendment or extension affects any previously issued
   notices.
   2.4.9. WWA Extensions. WWAs may be extended provided the extension is issued prior to
   the expiration of the original notice.
   2.4.10. WWA Cancellation. Warnings and watches are canceled when the weather
   phenomena is no longer occurring or expected to occur. Warnings and watches not extended
   or canceled will automatically expire at the end of the valid period. Observed advisories will
   be canceled when the criteria is no longer occurring and have not occurred in the last 15
   minutes. Lightning watches are canceled only when the potential for lightning within the next
   30 minutes is no longer forecast. See paragraph 2.4.4.1 for cancellation of observed
   lightning warnings.
2.5. Dissemination Process.
   2.5.1. Observations and TAFs. The FAA and NWS transmit observations and forecasts
   through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Wire
   Service (NWWS). The NWWS is a satellite data collection and redistribution system
   operated by the NWS. From there, the Telecommunication Operations Center (TOC) and the
   National Weather Service Telecommunication Gateway (NWSTG) is a central source for
   products & observations through file retrieval & webpage services. A major component the
   NWSTG is the central data switching system called the “Gateway”. The Gateway operates
   web servers and file servers. The web and file servers store all nationally-generated forecast
   products and globally received observational data.
   2.5.2. SWSs. SWSs provide advance notice of widespread hazardous weather conditions
   that have the potential to affect Hickam Field Air Operations. 17 OWS transmits SWSs to
   WF leadership via email and will post it via the 17 OWS website
   (https://17ows.hickam.af.mil/). WF leadership will forward SWSs to 15 WG/154 WG
   leadership.
   2.5.3. WWAs. The 17 OWS or WF will enter WWAs into the JET which will disseminate
   the information to 15 WG/CP, 154 WG/CP, 15 OSS/ Operations Support Airfield
   Management (OSAM), USAPAT, 735 Air Mobility Squadron (AMS), 647 ABG, and 613
   Air and Space Operations Center (AOC). If JET is out-of-service, 17 OWS or the WF will
   make back-up calls. Upon notification, these units will further disseminate WWAs using a
   notification scheme such as the pyramid notification diagram illustrated in Attachment 5, a
   Quick Reaction Checklist (QRC), E-Mail and/or AtHoc.
      2.5.3.1. Lightning Warnings. All lightning warnings are disseminated by the 15 WG/CP
      to the base populace via E-mails and/or AtHoc, 24 hours a day allowing members on base
      to be prepared for dangerous weather.
      2.5.3.2. Tornado Warnings. The Navy Regional Operations Center (ROC) has the
      primary responsibility for sounding the base siren for a tornado warning issuance.
15WGI15-101 9 JULY 2014                                                                     17


2.6. Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW). In accordance with AFMAN 15-111, exploitation
units that are responsible for preparing and transmitting surface weather observations will
establish a CWW with Air Traffic Control (ATC) and other appropriate base/post agencies, as
required. US Military forces does not have command authority over the submitted content or
dissemination of weather aviation services for the airfield, thus, considering the intent of
establishing a CWW per AFMAN 15-111 outlining those units responsible for preparing and
transmitting surface weather observations, the WF is not required to establish a CWW program.
Security Forces, Maintenance, Civil Engineering, and HRF personnel are encouraged to report
any weather conditions impacting the safety of local operations and resources to the WF. See
paragraph 2.2.2 for surface observation responsibilities.
2.7. PMSV Support. Weather information is available via PMSV during duty hours on
frequency 346.6 MHz. The duty forecaster will monitor PMSV traffic for all aircraft contacts.
For aircraft outside the range of our PMSV system, the WF or 17 OWS can provide PMSV
support through a phone patch to the 15WG/CP (DSN 448-6900/Commercial (808) 448-6900).
PMSV outages are discussed in para 5.3.2
2.8. Emergency Action(s) Response.
   2.8.1. Aircraft Mishap. When notified on an aircraft mishap, the WF will initiate a save of
   applicable data used in the development of any weather products provided and provide this
   data to investigating agencies upon request.
       2.8.1.1. If the WF provided the MWP, the WF will notify the 17 OWS Senior Duty
       Officer/ Noncommissioned Officer in Charge (NCOIC) of all aircraft mishaps as soon as
       possible after notification of the event. The WF will coordinate with 17 OWS to save all
       applicable data and products. If products from other OWSs were used, the WF will
       coordinate with all applicable OWSs to ensure data is saved. Enough data covering
       weather conditions before and after the mishap will be saved to fully reconstruct
       environmental conditions.
       2.8.1.2. If an OWS, TACC/XOW, or another WF provided the MWP, they will conduct
       the data save in coordination with any other Air Force Weather units involved. The WF
       will assist to the greatest extent possible.
   2.8.2. Severe Weather Action Plan (SWAP). The WF will initiate SWAP in accordance
   with criteria listed in Table 2.8 SWAP ensures sufficient manpower is available to meet the
   increased demand for timely weather information from its supported unit(s) during
   significant weather events. It is imperative that timely and accurate weather watches,
   warnings, and advisories are disseminated to all agencies to ensure RP of personnel and
   equipment. The WF will initiate a heightened METWATCH. The WF forecaster will notify
   the WF leadership of SWAP activation during normal staff duty hours. During non-duty
   hours, the 17 OWS will notify the WF on-call forecaster when conditions listed in Table 2.8
   have been met and the WF will activate SWAP.
 18                                                                15WGI15-101 9 JULY 2014

      Tropical Cyclone Conditions of Readiness (TCCOR)
      JBPH-H is placed in TCCOR 2 or 1.
   2.8.3. WF Forecaster Recall Requirements. The WF forecaster will be notified/recalled
   under the following circumstances:
        2.8.3.1. The 17 OWS notifies the on-call forecaster prior to issuing any watch or warning
        for Hickam Field Air Operations.
        2.8.3.2. The 15WG/CP initiates the IWOC/WOC as directed by the 15 WG/CC.
        2.8.3.3. The 647 ABG initiates the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) as directed by
        the 647 ABG/CC.
        2.8.3.4. Any special mission arrives on station. 15 WG/XP, Airfield Management
        Operations (AMOPS), or 15 WG/CP will notify the on-call forecaster of any unexpected
        special mission arrivals.
   2.8.4. Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-yield Explosive (CBRNE)
   Response.
        2.8.4.1. Due to joint basing, the WF is not the supporting weather organization for EM
        situations. According to JBPH-H 3440.17 EM Plan, Appendix 5, the 647 Civil Engineer
        Squadron (CES) is responsible for calculating an initial toxic corridor/downwind hazard
        area utilizing CBRN plume models (e.g., Joint Effects Model (JEM), Area Locations of
        Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA), Computer-Aided Management of Emergency
        Operations (CAMEO), etc.). Weather sensing equipment onboard (e.g., Magellan, Orion
        Nomad, Pegasus) the JBPHH Chemical Biological Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN)
        Response Trailer are weather systems that each has a built-in interface to automatically
        and continuously provide up-to-minute weather data at the scene by interfacing with
        CAMEO/Mapping Applications for Response, Planning, and Local Operational Tasks
        (MARPLOT)/ALOHA software. Additionally, the 647 CES will rely on the Naval
15WGI15-101 9 JULY 2014                                                                     19


     Maritime Forecast Center and Joint Typhoon Warning Center (Annex P) for all weather
     data needed for EM issues; however, WF will serve as a backup, if necessary.
     2.8.4.2. If surface observations or alphanumeric forecasts are requested, the WF will
     ensure that observations and forecasts provided are representative of the location/time of
     the CBRN event.
     2.8.4.3. Work closely with EM or other functions to ensure the supported commander
     gets a consistent picture.
     2.8.4.4. Upon request from Disaster Preparedness or any other agency, obtain/provide
     Chemical Downwind Messages from the servicing OWS.

                                           Chapter 3

                                    MISSION SERVICES

3.1. General. The WF and 17 OWS support the Hickam Field Air Operations flying and non-
flying missions. This chapter identifies the flying and non-flying missions and the weather
support provided.
3.2. Flying Missions. The WF provides weather support to the flying units listed in
Attachment 6.
3.3. Mission Weather Products (MWP). MWPs fuse theater scale products with local mission
requirements enabling the direct inject of weather impacts into warfighter planning and/or
execution. MWPs are tailored to individual customer requirements and include flight weather
briefings, mission planning briefs, and any other weather products prepared to meet the needs of
a supported unit. MWPs are developed using the administrative and operational Mission
Execution Forecast Process (MEFP) outlined in AFMAN 15-129V2 and supplemented by the
WF’s internal MEFP. The result is a product designed to provide timely, accurate, and relevant
environmental information for planning and execution. The MWPs must be horizontally
consistent with (but not necessarily mirror) products issued by any OWS and Air Force Weather
Agency (AFWA).
   3.3.1. Mission Execution Forecast (MEF). The daily web-based aviation MEF is designed to
   provide critical go/no-go weather information for all phases of local flying customers’ sorties
   (see Attachment 7 for sample product). It includes Drop-Zone (DZ) and air refueling (AR)
   forecasts, Take-Off/Landing Data (TOLD), solar/lunar data, flight hazards, and flight level
   winds for supported customers’ mission operating areas. The MEF is available through the
   17      OWS       webpage      and      Hickam      Weather       Flight     tailored    page:
   https://17ows.hickam.af.mil/Tailored_Met/index.cfm?fuseaction=showunit&menu=Y&
   AOI=1&UID=&BW=H&UF=M&AOR=1&USEHF=1&TEST=0&UID=508 (under other
   links). In the event of a Local Area Network (LAN) outage, the web-based MEF will be
   faxed or emailed to the appropriate flying squadrons.
       3.3.1.1. Issue Times. The web-based aviation MEF will be issued during normal duty
       days at 0600L and 1400L. Once issued, the MEF is valid for 24 hours. It will not be
       issued when the local flying is not occurring.
       3.3.1.2. Amendments/Updates. The web-based aviation MEF will be monitored
       continuously and updated as required. The MEF will be amended when TOLD is out of
       category and/or the Route/DZ/AR forecast is no longer representative of current or
       forecasted conditions and could adversely impact the scheduled sortie. Amendment
       conditions are constructed utilizing the mission limiting thresholds for supported aircraft
       in Attachment 6. The following represents mandatory amendment criteria:
           3.3.1.2.1. Ceilings. Any observed or forecasted ceiling conditions that increase to or
           exceed, or decrease to less than the following values in Table 3.1.
15WGI15-101 9 JULY 2014                                                                         21

3               2                1½             1             ¾                     ½
           3.3.1.2.3. Wind. Any difference between the predominant wind speed and forecast
           wind speed is ≥ 10 knots (including gusts) or the difference in forecast wind direction
           of 30 degrees or more when the predominant wind speed (including gusts) is, or is
           forecast to be, in excess of 15 knots. Additionally, the MEF will be amended when
           the airdrop thresholds meet, exceed, or drop below thresholds listed in Attachment 6
           during the forecast period and was not correctly forecasted or if no longer occurring
           or expected to occur.
           3.3.1.2.4. Thunderstorms. The time thunderstorms start or stop if not in the forecast
           or forecast for a different time.
           3.3.1.2.5. Turbulence and Icing. For TOLD and DZ forecasts in which beginning or
           ending of the condition(s), not associated with thunderstorms, from the surface to
           10,000 feet MSL which first meet, exceed, or decrease below moderate or severe
           thresholds for CAT II aircraft and weren’t specified in the forecast. For AR tracks,
           any time beginning or ending conditions which first meet, exceed, or decrease below
           moderate or severe thresholds for CAT II aircraft and was not specified in the
           forecast.
           3.3.1.2.6. WWA. Any established weather warnings or advisory (see Tables 2.4-2.7)
           which occur, or were expected to occur during the forecast period but was not
           correctly forecasted or if no longer occurring or expected to occur.
           3.3.1.2.7. Forecaster Discretion. Any meteorological condition the forecaster feels is
           necessary to update due to safety of the mission.
       3.3.1.3. Decoding. The MEF utilizes the standard meteorological coding for
       alphanumeric and graphical depiction using standard weather symbols, line types, color
       representations, and isopleths as outlined in AFH 11-203v2, Weather For Aircrews.
       3.3.1.4. Formal Briefing. Aircrews should call the WF forecaster at 449-2251 to receive
       any updates to the web-based aviation MEF and gain a full understanding of expected
       weather impacts to their mission. Aircrews should call NLT 1 1/2 hours before their
       designated take-off time to receive their briefing.
       3.3.1.5. Metrics. The WF will provide metrics on MEF accuracy and status of
       products/services as requested.
    3.3.2. Flight Weather Briefings (175-1s). Weather personnel will provide verbal or
    traditional flight weather briefings (DD Form 175-1, Flight Weather Briefing) to aircrews as
 22                                                                 15WGI15-101 9 JULY 2014


   requested and in accordance with the flight’s duty priorities as listed in Table 1.1. Briefings
   will be provided either through email/fax/phone. Please provide weather personnel as much
   lead time as possible to complete the DD 175-1 request by calling 449-2251 ahead of time.
   Out-of-station mass briefings for special missions require 48-hours advance notice, are
   subject to staffing availability, and must be coordinated with weather flight leadership at 449-
   2250/1201. Transient aircrews can receive flight weather briefings from either the WF
   (during normal duty hours) or the 17 OWS. The 17 OWS briefing cell can be contacted by
   phone (DSN (315) 449-8333), fax (DSN (315) 449-8336), or via the web:
   https://17ows.hickam.af.mil/wx_brief/index.cfm?fuseaction=request&AOI=1&UID=508
   &BW=H&UF=M&AOR=1&USEHF=1&TEST=0. The OWS requests 2 hours advance
   notice of DD 175-1 briefings.
3.4. Tropical Weather Support. Each year, tropical cyclones threaten US forces operating in
the Pacific and Indian oceans. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), Pearl Harbor, HI, the
Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC), Honolulu, HI, and the National Hurricane Center
(NHC), Miami, FL, issue tropical cyclone warnings and advisories. JTWC’s AOR is from the
East Coast of Africa to the West Coast of the Americas. CPHC issues civil tropical cyclone
forecasts/advisories north of the equator between 180° and 140° W. NHC issues civil tropical
cyclone forecasts/advisories north of the equator between 140° W and the West Coast of the
Americas. In the CPHC and NHC AOR, JTWC will reissue the National Weather Service
forecasts as warnings for DOD installation application/utilization. If CPHC or NHC disagree
with JTWC’s assessment that a warning should be issued, JTWC has the authority to issue its
own warnings.
   3.4.1. Tropical Cyclone-Threat Assessment Product (TC-TAP). During periods when
   tropical cyclones are threatening USPACOM installations, the National Military Command
   Center, Air Force Operations Center and major commands possessing assets or facilities on
   these installations continually monitor the weather and on-site actions taken to prevent or
   minimize damage. In addition to the JTWC or NHC Tropical Cyclone (TC) warnings, the
   TC-TAP bulletins serve as a vital source of TC forecast information for briefings to
   operational units at selected commands and operations centers.
       3.4.1.1. The TC-TAP will contain, at a minimum, the following:
          3.4.1.1.1. Time and date product was produced and the NHC/CPHC/JTWC bulletin
          number/ identifier used to create the product.
          3.4.1.1.2. Onset and duration of sustained 35-knot and 50-knot winds.
          3.4.1.1.3. Peak wind and time of occurrence, including gusts.
          3.4.1.1.4. Onset and duration of operationally significant (locally determined)
          crosswinds, including gusts for the primary instrumented runway. Use 25-knot
          crosswinds as the default.
          3.4.1.1.5. Closest point of approach of the storm relative to the installation.
          3.4.1.1.6. Forecast cone product.
       3.4.1.2. OWS Responsibilities. The 17 OWS will produce TC-TAP bulletins for each
       installation in their AOR where they own Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF)
       responsibility and/or provide site specific resource protection. All installations meeting
15WGI15-101 9 JULY 2014                                                                     23


     TC-TAP bulletin requirements will be reported on one bulletin. The 17 OWS will use the
     official storm forecast position, track, and intensity provided by either JTWC or the
     CPHC as appropriate. Any additional locations will be based on command operational
     requirements and coordinated through appropriate organizations. At a minimum, the 17
     OWS will prepare a bulletin whenever a TC-TAP location is expected to receive
     sustained winds greater than 35 knots in 96 hours or less due to a tropical cyclone, or if
     sustained winds of greater than 35 knots are already occurring due to a tropical cyclone.
     Any unit requirements for a bulletin beyond those listed above will be coordinated with
     the 17 OWS and should be limited to operational decisions such as evacuation,
     termination of exercise, etc.
     3.4.1.3. WF Responsibilities. The WF will provide supported 15 WG/154 WG
     commander(s) or decision level authority with forecasts of the expected onset, intensity
     and end times of significant winds, and other weather associated with tropical cyclones
     affecting Hickam Field Air Operation’s responsibility. The WF is not authorized to tailor
     TC-TAP bulletins without coordination with the issuing agency and should be fully
     engaged in the coordination process prior to the bulletin being issued.
  3.4.2. Tropical Cyclone (TC) Message. In accordance with PACAFI15-101, When a TC of
  tropical storm strength or greater passes within 150nm of a USAF military weather reporting
  unit in USPACOM, the WF will prepare a message and send it to JTWC within 24 hours of

       SWAT will go on alert and personnel will remain ready for activation in case the duty
       forecaster needs assistance in providing support for departing aircraft. When TCCOR 2 is
       initiated, the SWAT will automatically be activated. If requested, the SWAT Team
       Leader will send a representative to the IWOC for real time weather updates for the Wing
       Commander(s) and coordinate weather support for the duration of the event and post-
       recovery period.
3.5. MISSIONWATCH. This is a deliberate process for monitoring terrestrial weather and/or
the space environment for specific mission-limiting environmental factors. The WF will ensure
all facets of the mission has a deliberate MISSIONWATCH process utilizing the knowledge of
flight schedules, tactics, and close contact with Supervisors of Flying (SOFs) and ops cells.
Other meteorological and commercial data sources will be used to accomplish this task at the
discretion of the Duty Technician. During rapidly changing weather, the WF will amend/update
MWPs as required (see paragraph 3.3.1.2 for amendment thresholds) and contact the applicable
agencies to pass on critical changes and recommend alternatives to exploit mission weather.
Forecasters continually monitor the flight routes of each mission departing and returning to
Hickam Field Air Operations, and will immediately notify the aircrew if weather develops in
their route that was not previously briefed/forecasted through the MWP amendment process (see
paragraph 3.3.1.2). The 17 OWS will perform flight and route MISSIONWATCH for transient
flights they brief which depart from Hickam Field. The WF will perform flight and route
15WGI15-101 9 JULY 2014                                                                        25


MISSIONWATCH for transient flights departing Hickam Field that were briefed by WF
personnel.
3.6. Post-Mission Analysis. In conjunction with post-mission analysis, Operational
Verification (OPVER) of the MEF is the single most important mission-oriented, operational
effectiveness assessment requirements for a Weather Flight (WF). An essential aspect of every
technical service is to know how well it meets the user’s operational requirements. To obtain this
information, WFs must establish a meaningful product evaluation program. The goal should be
to effectively and efficiently monitor both strengths and weaknesses of WF technical
performance across the spectrum of mission weather support provided. Common improvement
areas are usually in technical meteorological skill and packaging/delivery of weather products.
As part of the Post-Mission Analysis, the WF will conduct and provide Go/No Go Metrics on the
MEF upon request. Additionally, the WF will ensure weather products and services conform to
customer needs, meet or exceed established standards, and produce customer satisfaction. Data
collected from Quality Assurance (QA) assessments will be used to identify adverse trends,
improve procedures, and focus training efforts on key problem areas. Data collected from
operational verifications and technical evaluations of weather products and services will be used
to measure and assess, and act to continuously improve, MWP.
   3.6.1. Mission Weather Support Feedback. Aircrews should make a consistent and deliberate
   intent to make contact the WF with post-mission information and/or follow-up support. The
   WF will utilize customer feedback to improve internal processes and enhance training,
   forecast proficiency, and product accuracy. Formal/informal feedback methods include:
       3.6.1.1. Completion of feedback worksheet located on the MEF or when directed via
       email solicitation.
       3.6.1.2. Phone call or an e-mail to the WF.
       3.6.1.3. Face-to-face feedback after briefing and/or mission completion.
3.7. Transient Aircrew Support. Weather technicians will provide or arrange for weather
support for transient aircrews IAW the duty priorities list in Table 1.1 The WF may provide
flight weather briefings (175-1s), and/or updates to aircrews. Weather technicians may arrange
for weather support from the 17 OWS briefing cell when greater duty priorities take precedence.
The 17 OWS briefing cell can be reached at DSN 315 449-8333, commercial (808) 449-8333, or
via web access from the aircrew briefing terminal located in the flight planning room.
3.8. Non-Flying Missions. The WF and 17 OWS support various non-flying missions (e.g.,
WG Picnic, change of command ceremonies, Morale Welfare and Recreation) through RP
(WWAs). Specific support to non-flying missions is identified in Chapter 4. Specialized
weather information can be provided to support any non-flying mission upon request. Non-
governmental agencies should request weather information and support through 15 WG/PA and
legal offices.
3.9. Space Weather Impacts. Hickam Field Air Operation’s missions have a wide-variety of
parameters affected by various space-weather conditions (e.g., High Frequency and Ultra High
Frequency communication, radar, Global Positioning System communications, etc.). The WF
will provide space impacts on their MWPs. Examples of the products utilized to inject space
weather impacts are provided in Attachment 9.

3.10. Tactical Decision Aids. Although the WF handles 19/199 Fighter Squadron (FS) (F-22)
support, at this time, no parent/host units requires Tactical Decision Aids (TDA) or electro-
optical aids such as the Target Acquisition Weather Software (TAWS) on a consistent basis. WF
leadership requires that parent/host units inform them of changes to their TDA needs so that
procedures, training, and updated software can be generated accordingly.
3.11. Alert Support. The WF will provide alert outlook for the 19/199 FS during periods of
extended closure (i.e., weekends). This product will be developed on the last duty day of the
week and will be valid through the closure period. This product is not intended to serve as an
official weather brief or mission execution forecast and is simply an outlook for situational
awareness. No amendments will be provided for this product and the mission limiting thresholds
will be developed based on criteria listed in Attachment 6. See Attachment 8 for sample
product.

                                          Chapter 5

                                 WEATHER EQUIPMENT

5.1. General. This chapter provides a brief description of the meteorological and
communications equipment used by the WF. Additionally, it provides information on backup
systems, maintenance, and restoring priorities.
5.2. Meteorological Equipment. The WF uses advanced meteorological equipment to
determine the current state of the atmosphere. These critical systems provide customers the most
timely, accurate and relevant weather intelligence possible. Note: TMQ-53 is a tactical
automated observing system that is used by the WF during contingency and exercise operations.
   5.2.1. Video Display Unit (VDU). The FAA’s primary observation system is an ASOS and
   a certified, contracted observer augments the primary observation equipment and provides
   backup when required. The ASOS provides a dedicated feed via the VDU that provides an
   up-to-date feed of the latest airfield conditions from Honolulu International Airport.
       5.2.1.1. The ASOS is a type of automated surface weather observing system developed
       through a joint FAA/NWS/DOD agreement. FAA ASOSs are installed at designated
       airports and maintained by the NWS to meet FAA requirements. The ASOS samples,
       measures, and reports: temperature, wind speed and direction, visibility, cloud base
       height and amount of coverage, pressure, liquid equivalent precipitation accumulation,
       and ice accretion during freezing precipitation (if applicable). These measurements are
       processed to create properly formatted, fully automated observations that comply with
       applicable various reporting standards and protocols defined in the Federal
       Meteorological Handbook (FMH-1), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the
       FAA, NWS, and military reporting standards.
   5.2.2. Lightning Detection. Vaisala TSS 928 provides local-area lightning tracking.
   Lightning-sensitive operations rely on TSS 928 to provide critical local lightning threat
   information to take advance precautions and initiate safety procedures. Back-up sources of
   national lightning data are available through the Air Force Weather-Web Services (AFW-
   WEBS).
   5.2.3. Kestrel 4500. The Kestrel is a hand-held device that provides temperature, dew point,
   wind speed/direction, and pressure readings. The Kestrel is the backup meteorological data
   for TMQ-53 outages and is utilized for training purposes only.
5.3. Communications Equipment. The following systems are the backbone of the WF
communications network:
   5.3.1. JET. As discussed in para 2.5 of this instruction, JET is the primary system for
   disseminating warnings, watches, and advisories. Telephones are used as a backup for key
   aircraft controlling agencies.
   5.3.2. PMSV Radio. The PMSV Radio (346.6 MHz) allows the WF to communicate with
   aircrews, both on the ground and flying, as well as tower personnel. If the PMSV is out-of-
   service, aircrews can contact Wheeler Army Airfield (AAF) Weather at 125.1 MHz (if within
   range) or the WF and/or 17 OWS can provide PMSV support through a phone patch to the
   15WG/CP (DSN 448-6900/Commercial (808) 448-6900).
 38                                                                 15WGI15-101 9 JULY 2014


   5.3.3. Phones/Hotlines. Phones and hotlines serve primarily for rapidly passing along
   critical, time-sensitive information, as well as to serve for backup services.
   5.3.4. LAN. The WF relies heavily on the LAN to improve the timeliness and accuracy of
   weather intelligence to our customers.
5.4. Maintenance.

Table 5.1. identifies which organizations provide preventive maintenance and repair
weather and communications equipment.

 747 CS/SCOA (Airfield Systems)                             PMSV (OK-423 system)
   5.4.1. Restoral Priorities. Priorities for restoring critical systems exist in the event natural
   disasters or any other anomaly, simultaneously impacting systems base wide. Significant
   indicates a situation where the equipment is completely inoperative, while minimal means
   the equipment is in limited operation. The priorities for weather equipment are listed below
   (priorities may be adjusted based on forecasted weather) in Table 5.2
