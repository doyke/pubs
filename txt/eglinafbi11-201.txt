1.5. Bird Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Alerting Procedures. BASH program
guidance and procedures are established in Air Armament Center Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard
Plan (EAFB Plan 91-212, Bird Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard Plan). All personnel utilizing
EAFB, the Range Complex or Duke Field will comply with this instruction. Aircrew must report
all bird strikes and are strongly encouraged to report any bird sightings that pose probable
hazards to flying to a controlling agency. The controlling agency must relay that information to
AM Ops and other aircrew as needed. Additionally, aircrew will adhere to warnings reported on
EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013                                                                        13

BWC.
2. RCO update by accessing AHAS (NEXRAD data) and by real-time observations.
   1.5.1. If an aircrew observes or encounters any bird activity, while in flight, that constitutes a
   hazard to flight safety, the aircrew shall notify one or all of the following: Eglin SOF,
   control tower, Eglin Radar Control Facility (ERCF), mission controller or the RCO. Once
   notified, those individuals shall pass all pertinent information to the EAFB or Duke Field
   Airfield Manager or designated representative. Information should include the following:
       1.5.1.1. Aircraft call sign.
       1.5.1.2. Altitude of birds.

     1.5.1.3. Approximate number of birds.
     1.5.1.4. Type of birds, if known.
     1.5.1.5. Location/direction of flight or roost.
     1.5.1.6. Local time of sighting.
  1.5.2. The following terminology will be used for rapid communication to disseminate bird
  activity and implement unit operational procedures.
     1.5.2.1. BWC/Range Complex SEVERE. There is a high bird presence on the active
     runway or other specific locations that represent a high potential for strike. As a general
     rule, 6 large birds or 30 small birds in the arrival/departure corridor should be considered
     a SEVERE BWC. At either airfield, the following operational limitations are in effect
     with BWC SEVERE:
         1.5.2.1.1. Landings. Only one approach to a full-stop landing is permitted.
         1.5.2.1.2. Takeoffs are prohibited without the flying unit’s OG/CC or higher
         approval. If approved; no formation takeoffs are permitted.
         1.5.2.1.3. Pattern. Aircraft will hold (fuel permitting) until the hazards no longer
         exist. The SOF will consider closing the overhead pattern if that will minimize the
         risk to the observed bird activity.
         1.5.2.1.4. The Eglin SOF shall consider delaying departures/arrivals and aircraft
         diverts. The Tower Watch Supervisor (WS) may consider changing runways. If a
         hazard is confined to a specific location that would allow safe operations to the
         adjacent runway, the Tower WS and/or SOF may decide to continue operations to the
         hazard free runway. Example: Numerous birds on approach end of Runway (RWY)
         12 with no bird hazards effecting RWY 19, the SOF and/or Tower WS may transition
         all traffic to RWY 19.
         1.5.2.1.5. If the BWC is declared SEVERE in the range complex, a specific area and
         altitude will be identified and the area will be avoided by all flights using the range.
     1.5.2.2. BWC/Range Complex MODERATE. Increased bird activity in locations which
     represent an increased potential for strike but does not constitute BWC SEVERE. This
     condition requires increased vigilance by all agencies, supervisors and aircrew. Traffic
     patterns shall be limited to the minimum training requirements. Pilots will be particularly
     cognizant of bird activity when on final and will avoid low, flat approaches. If BWC
     Moderate is declared in the Eglin Range Complex, flight leads will change event order or
     amend altitudes to minimize the hazard.
     1.5.2.3. BWC/Range Condition LOW. Used during normal bird activity on and above
     the airfield with low probability of hazard. BWC LOW is declared when bird activity is
     no longer observed following the declaration of a SEVERE or MODERATE BWC. No
     restrictions on flying operations.
  1.5.3. All personnel discovering a bird strike will initiate AF Form 853 or equivalent, Air
  Force Wildlife Strike Report, and notify the Maintenance Operations Control Center
  (MOCC) and AM Ops. The MOCC will notify 96 TW Flight Safety and Quality Assurance
  (QA).
EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013                                                                     15


   1.5.4. Eglin BASH Cannons. AM Ops, SOF, Flight Safety, Civil Engineering Pest
   Management, Jackson Guard, USDA Wildlife Services, and Tower WS have the authority to
   activate the BASH cannons. The cannons can be activated by remote (located at base
   operations) or through the Control Tower by request. The BASH cannons are located in
   various groups around the airfield at Eglin and Duke and will only be activated with tower
   approval contingent on traffic. Cannon groups will not be activated with arriving, departing,
   or taxiing aircraft in the vicinity of the cannons. Eglin Control Tower permission must be
   received prior to any BASH cannon activation at the respective airfields.
1.6. Pilot/AOF Liaison (PAOL) Program. The 96 OSS AOF/CC is the OPR for the PAOFL
program. 96 OG/OGV and each flying squadron shall assign a qualified representative as a point
of contact to the PAOL program.
1.7. Local Frequency Channelization.

                   LOCAL AIRSPACE/FLYING AREAS/TEST AREAS

2.1. EAFB Reservation. The EAFB reservation comprises all real property under jurisdiction
of the 96 Test Wing Commander (96 TW/CC). The boundaries, in general, may be described as
Choctawhatchee Bay and Santa Rosa Sound to the south; East Bay on the west; US Highway 331
on the east; and Yellow River and US Highway 90 to the north. The reservation includes
multiple tactical training areas, test areas, instrumented sites, EAFB, Hurlburt Field, Eglin
Auxiliary Field 3 (Duke Field), FL34 (Field 6), Auxiliary Field 1, and Auxiliary Field 10, Dillon
Field--also known as NOLF Choctaw, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) identifier NFJ.
Specific procedures for Choctaw Field are not prescribed in this regulation. Restricted airspace
and 14 CFR Part 93, Special Air Traffic Rules airspace overlays most of the reservation and there
are parts of the airspace over publicly owned property. (See Attachment 6)
2.2. Local Flying Area. The local flying area consists of the National Airspace System (NAS),
Special Use Airspace (SUA), and Airspace for Special Use (ASU). Airspace includes restricted
areas, military operations areas (MOA), 14 CFR Part 93 airspace, warning areas, controlled
firing areas (CFA), Class C, D, and E airspace, military training routes, and the uncharted Eglin
Water Test Areas (EWTA). This document will only address that airspace under the ownership
or control of the 96th Test Wing. Other SUA or ASU in the local area are available for mission
execution and the attributes and scheduling of each can be found in the DoD FLIP, Section
AP/1A, JO 7400.8, Special Use Airspace, and Hurlburt Field Instruction (HFI) 11-201, Fixed
and Rotary Wing Operations. (See Attachments 6, 7, and 8)
2.3. Restricted Areas. Eglin’s SUA includes restricted areas R-2914A/B, R-2915A/B/C, R-
2917, R-2918, and R-2919A/B (See Attachment 8). The attributes of these areas are described
in the DoD FLIP and JO 7400.8. R-2917, owned by United States Space Command
(USSPACECOM), is the hazard zone around Site C-6, Space Detection and Tracking System
(SPADATS). Site C-6 is the FPS-85 radar located within an unpublished 1 SM radius circle
centered at 30º34’21”N/086º12’53”W which goes from surface to 5,000 ft Mean Sea Level
(MSL). Due to the nature and operation of SPADATS, R-2917 (surface to 5,000 ft MSL) is a
no-fly zone for all aircraft.
2.4. Military Operations Areas (MOA). EAFB SUA includes Eglin A East, A West, B, C, D,
E, F MOAs and Rose Hill MOA. Eglin A East, A West, B, C, D, and F MOAs are designated
for controlled egress and ingress for aircraft that wish to utilize the airspace over the EAFB
Reservation. (See Attachment 8.) This only applies to aircraft under the control of ERCF that
cannot be contained in the airspace over the EAFB Reservation due to a mission profile. These
MOAs shall be called up automatically by the ERCF for the requested altitudes if the profile for
the mission reflects utilization of that airspace. The attributes of these MOAs are described in
the DoD FLIP and JO 7400.8. Note: Due to high density airway traffic and flow constraints
north of the EAFB Reservation, normally only a block altitude of 2,000 ft may be scheduled
within the Eglin A, B, C and D MOAs at any given time. Excluding Eglin F MOA, any altitude
requested above 10,000 ft MSL will require Jacksonville Center approval. Note: The Eglin A
MOA is divided into an east and west section. The west section lies within Pensacola
Approach’s airspace and requires 15 minutes prior coordination by Eglin Approach for use. The
Navy Whiting Class C airspace is not part of Eglin A MOA.
 20                                                              EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013


   2.4.1. Eglin D MOA. The Eglin D MOA is designated to provide airspace for the control of
   aircraft transitioning from the Clear Springs Initial Point (IP) to Eglin Test Area C-62, within
   R-2914A, and from R-2914A to the IP. This MOA is designed to be used in conjunction
   with Eglin C MOA. Use of the area is coordinated through the ERCF with a required
   minimum of 15 minutes prior notification.
   2.4.2. Eglin E MOA/Air Traffic Control Assigned Airspace (ATCAA). Eglin E MOA
   overlies all of the Eglin restricted areas (excluding R-2917) and the 14 CFR Part 93 airspace.
   Use of Eglin E MOA is for those missions that are not classified as hazardous. Upon request,
   ERCF may approve up to, but not including FL180. Note: The Eglin E MOA Air Traffic
   Control Assigned Airspace (Eglin E MOA ATCAA) overlays the North-South Corridor and
   that part of the East-West Corridor not under restricted airspace and extends from FL180 to
   FL600.
   2.4.3. Eglin F MOA. This MOA is designated for controlled penetration of the small
   triangular area on the western boundary of R-2915B by mission aircraft under control of the
   ERCF that cannot be contained in R-2915A/B/C because of the mission profile.
2.5. 14 CFR PART 93 Airspace. 14 CFR Part 93 Airspace is necessary to simplify operating
procedures, airspace assignment, and airspace use within the Valparaiso, Florida, Terminal Area.
14 CFR Part 93 Airspace denotes special airport traffic patterns and airport traffic areas. It also
prescribes special air traffic rules for operating aircraft in those traffic patterns and traffic areas
and in the vicinity of airports so designated as needing special consideration. Unless otherwise
authorized by ATC, each person operating an aircraft shall do so in accordance with the special
air traffic rules in 14 CFR Part 93 in addition to other applicable rules in 14 CFR Part 91.
   2.5.1. Eglin North-South Corridor. For dimensions of airspace within the boundaries of the
   Eglin North-South Corridor, see 14 CFR Part 93 rules and the New Orleans Sectional. To
   operate in the North-South Corridor, an aircraft must receive permission from the ERCF and
   maintain two-way radio communications with the ERCF or an appropriate ATC facility.
   This area is designed to facilitate aircraft movement to and from Eglin, Duke Field, Hurlburt
   Field, and Destin Airports. This area is also used in conjunction with the Eglin eastern range
   complex, Eglin western range complex, or both range complexes to support special mission
   requirements.
   2.5.2. Eglin East-West Corridor. For dimensions of airspace within these boundaries of the
   Eglin East-West Corridor, see 14 CFR Part 93 rules and the New Orleans Sectional. The
   corridor is divided into four sections to accommodate the different altitudes of R-2915C, R-
   2919B, and R-2914B. Unless otherwise authorized by ATC, no one shall operate an aircraft
   within the East-West Corridor without establishing and maintaining two-way radio
   communications with the ERCF and receiving an ATC advisory concerning operations being
   conducted therein. The East-West Corridor facilitates access to airports in the Eglin-Fort
   Walton Beach area and transition of aircraft from Pensacola to Panama City.
2.6. Warning Areas. EAFB SUA includes warning areas W-151, W-168, and W-470 (See
Attachment 9). The attributes of these areas are described in the DoD FLIP and JO 7400.8. In
DoD FLIP and the JO, W-151 and W-470 are subdivided into A through F areas. The 96th Test
Wing further subdivides these areas and the descriptions can be found in Attachments 10 and
11. The W-151 Shoreline Areas are used for test missions and are a subdivision of W-151A and
W-151B and designed as W-151 S3, S4, S5, S6, and S7. This airspace shall not normally be

scheduled for training missions in order to minimize congestion for approach control services to
EAFB and Tyndall AFB.
2.7. Military Training Routes (MTR). There are two Visual Routes (VR) scheduled by the
96th Test Wing: VR1082 and VR1085. The description and attributes of MTRs can be found in
DoD FLIP AP/1B. Both routes terminate on the EAFB Reservation. Other MTRs (instrument,
visual, and slow routes) not owned or scheduled by the 96th Test Wing may also terminate on
the reservation.
2.8. Controlled Firing Areas (CFA).
   2.8.1. Santa Rosa Island CFA. Santa Rosa Island CFA is used for developmental and
   operational testing of missiles, rockets, and artillery. (See Attachment 12) It is activated by
   Notice to Airmen (NOTAM). The CFA will not be used for launch and operation of Remote
   Piloted Aircraft (RPA)into the East-West Corridor.
   2.8.2. Cape San Blas CFA. The Cape San Blas CFA is located at Eglin Test Area D-3
   southeast of Tyndall AFB and is used for developmental and operational test and training of
   missiles, rockets, and artillery. It is activated by NOTAM. The CFA will not be used for
   launch and operation of RPAs into the East-West Corridor.
2.9. Class D/E Surface Areas.
   2.9.1. Eglin Class D. Eglin Class D is that airspace extending from the surface up to and
   including 2,600 ft MSL within a 5.5 NM radius of the geographical center of EAFB, and
   within a 4 NM radius of the geographical center of the Destin airport. Eglin Tower may use
   that airspace within a 4 NM radius of the geographic center of Eglin airport, extending from
   the surface, up to and including 2,100 ft MSL for Visual Flight Rules (VFR) pattern work.
       2.9.1.1. When mission profiles on Test Area B-71 extend beyond the borders of R-
       2915A and intrude into the Eglin Tower traffic patterns, Eglin Tower shall not approve
       takeoffs on RWY 30 or landings on RWY 12 unless winds, runway condition, or
       emergencies preclude using RWY 1 and 19. Note: When Test Area B-71 activity is due
       to ground mounts, it shall be the pilot’s responsibility to avoid Test Area B-71 when it
       has been reported active.
   2.9.2. Hurlburt Class D Airspace. Hurlburt Class D is that airspace extending upward from
   the surface up to and including 2,500 ft MSL within a 5.3 NM radius of the geographical
   center of the airport, excluding that airspace which lies east of the eastern boundaries of R-
   2915B and R-2915C. Note: To the maximum extent possible, Eglin Chief of Airspace
   Management and Mission Planning (CAMMP) will provide a minimum of 48 hours prior
   notification to 1 SOG/OGO for all known mission activities within R-2915A/B that will
   affect Hurlburt operations. ERCF will notify Hurlburt Tower 15 minutes prior to the
   airspace actually being activated and real time when deactivated.
   2.9.3. Duke Field Class D Airspace. The Duke Field Class D is that airspace extending from
   the surface up to and including 2,700 ft MSL within a 5.2 NM radius of the geographical
   center of Duke Field airport. Duke Tower may use that airspace within a 4 NM radius of the
   geographic center of the airport from the surface up to and including 1,700 ft MSL. Duke
   Tower may use surface up to and including 1,000 ft MSL (depending on the ERCF’s
 22                                                           EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013


   operational requirements) beginning 1 NM east of and parallel to the extended runway
   centerline of RWY 18/36.
   2.9.4. Crestview/Bob Sikes Airport Class E Surface Area. The Crestview/Bob Sikes Airport
   Surface Area is within a 4.2 NM radius of Crestview/Bob Sikes Airport. This surface area is
   effective during published times or as established by NOTAM. At other times, the surface
   area will revert to Class G airspace.
2.10. Eglin/Duke Tower Transition Area (TTA). A TTA is established between Eglin and
Duke Field from the surface up to and including 1,700 ft MSL for VFR aircraft transiting
between the two airports. The transition area is that airspace contained within a north/south line
running from the western edges of Eglin and Duke’s Class D airspace and a line extending from
the eastern edge of the Eglin Class D due north to a point bearing 060 deg and 4.7 NM from the
Eglin Digital Airport Surveillance Radar (DASR) antenna, then a line extending northwest to a
point bearing 007 deg from the Eglin DASR antenna to the southern edge of the Duke Field
Class D. The transition area is delegated to Eglin Tower when Duke Tower is open. At other
times, the ERCF may release this area when requested, traffic permitting.
2.11. Water Hoist Helicopter Training Area. The water hoist helicopter training area is
located at the intersection of Boggy Bayou and Choctawhatchee Bay from the surface to 500 ft
MSL. Pilots shall:
   2.11.1. Conduct training in Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) (1,000-foot ceiling
   and 3 SM visibility for helicopters).
   2.11.2. Establish two-way radio communications with Eglin Tower; advise the tower of their
   intentions (length of time area will be used, direction/altitude of pattern, and hover altitude);
   obtain clearance from the tower to proceed with intended operation; monitor tower
   frequency; and advise the tower when flight activity in the area is completed.
   2.11.3. Fly a rectangular traffic pattern maneuvering to the water hoist pickup point.
   Maximum altitude shall be 500 ft above the surface or person/vessel on the surface.
   2.11.4. Maintain separation from other traffic. Note: Although this area is located in the
   Eglin Class D Surface Area, Eglin Tower personnel cannot observe the water hoist pickup
   point or the overlying airspace that is beneath the controller’s line of sight.
2.12. Aero Club/General Aviation Training Areas:
   2.12.1. North Training Area: The North Training Area is bounded on the North by Florala
   Airport, on the east by the eastern boundary of Eglin D MOA, on the south by US Highway
   90, and on the west by a straight line extending southward from the northwest corner of Eglin
   D MOA, through a point 6 NM east of Bob Sikes Airport, to Highway 90. (See Attachment
   12) Altitudes are from the surface to 6,000 ft MSL.
   2.12.2. East Training Area: The East Training Area is located over the eastern portion of the
   Choctawhatchee Bay (See Attachment 12). The East Training Area extends from Four Mile
   Point northward to the north shore of Choctawhatchee Bay, eastward to the north end of the
   Highway 331 Bridge, southward to Grayton Beach, westward along the beach to a point
   directly south of Four Mile Point, northward to Four Mile Point. Altitudes, when active, are
   from surface to 4,000 ft MSL.
EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013                                                                      23


2.13. Hurlburt “H” Gun Alignment Area. Hurlburt “H” area is used for airborne alignment
of sensor/fire control systems. This area is within a 5.3 NM radius around the geographical
center of Hurlburt Field, excluding that portion of airspace east of the eastern boundary of R-
2915A/B. It coincides with the Hurlburt Field Class D surface area. Assigned altitudes will be
as coordinated with ERCF. Restrictions may be imposed due to other mission activity. The 1
SOG/CC authorizes Military Authority Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft
(MARSA) of 1 SOW assigned aircraft operating simultaneously in A-77, A-78, B-6, B-7, and the
Hurlburt H Area. 1 SOW will also self-deconflict all other missions exclusively involving 1
SOW aircraft.
2.14. Duke Field Gun Alignment Area. The Duke Field Gun Alignment area is used for
airborne alignment of munitions systems. It encompasses the same lateral limits of the Duke
Field Class D Surface Area. The altitudes flown while in the area are as coordinated with the
ERCF. Restrictions may be imposed due to other mission airspace activity. Alignment sensor is
located on the south end of the airfield near the perimeter road and consists of a radar reflector,
obstruction light, light sensor relay, laser sensor/relay, microponder with mounting stand.
2.15. Eglin Water Test Area (EWTA). The EWTA is uncharted and procedures for use of this
airspace are established by LOA with Houston, Jacksonville, and Miami Centers. The areas do
not encompass any warning or restricted airspace but are used in conjunction with warning areas.
The purpose of the EWTA is to simplify the process of issuing NOTAMs when hazardous tests
require this airspace. The areas are known as Eglin Water Test Areas 1 through 6 and are shown
in Attachment 9.
2.16. Other Airports and Facilities.
   2.16.1. Destin-Fort Walton Beach Airport (DTS). Destin Airport is located within the Eglin
   Class D approximately 6 NM south-southeast of Eglin (DWG 155/06). Destin airport VFR
   traffic patterns are uncontrolled and aircraft operating within a 2 NM radius of the Destin
   Airport at or below 1,000 ft MSL are not required to contact the ERCF provided they remain
   on UNICOM frequency. Aircraft that need to transit the airport should contact Destin
   UNICOM on 123.075. THIS IS A HIGH TRAFFIC DENSITY, UNCONTROLLED
   AIRPORT and extreme vigilance should be used in its vicinity.
   2.16.2. Bob Sikes Airport (CEW) (DWG 360/18). Bob Sikes Airport is located
   approximately 8 NM north of Duke Field. Many civil and military aircraft (Navy and
   AFSOC helicopters, C-130, T-34, and T-6) operate within 5 NM of Bob Sikes Airport at or
   below 1,000 ft MSL. Bob Sikes Airport patterns are not tower controlled. Aircraft operating
   in the vicinity of Bob Sikes Airport should self-announce on CEW CTAF/UNICOM
   frequency 122.95.
   2.16.3. Crestview VORTAC (CEW). The CEW VORTAC is located approximately 9 NM
   west/northwest of Bob Sikes Airport. Many civil aircraft, Air Force and Navy helicopters,
   fixed-wing aircraft, and AF C-130 aircraft operate VFR within 10 NM of CEW. VFR
   aircraft transiting this area should obtain traffic advisories from Eglin Approach Control,
   124.05.
   2.16.4. DeFuniak Springs Airport (54J) (DWG 054/24). DeFuniak Springs Airport lies
   outside the northeast corner of R-2914A and 2 NM west of DeFuniak Springs. The airport is
24                                                           EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013


  a small public airport that has general aviation aircraft. Airport patterns are uncontrolled and
  the 54J CTAF/UNICOM frequency is 122.8.
  2.16.5. Fort Walton Beach Airport (1J9) (DWG 258/16). The Fort Walton Beach Airport is
  located 7 NM west of Hurlburt Field and underlies Eglin F MOA when active. Boomer
  Aviation operates a banner tow service from the airport and when military air operations
  occur on Santa Rosa Island and in the East-West Corridor, coordinate with the service by
  calling (850) 244-1313. Airport patterns are uncontrolled and the 1J9 CTAF/UNICOM
  frequency is 122.7.
EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013                                                                     25

                          RADAR AND MISSION PROCEDURES

3.1. Eglin Radar Control Facility (ERCF). Operating hours for the ERCF are 24 hours a day,
seven days a week. The ERCF is divided into two co-located functions:
   3.1.1. Eglin Radar Approach Control (RAPCON). RAPCON is responsible for providing
   terminal ATC services.
   3.1.2. Eglin Mission Control (EMC). During ingress/egress to/from mission assigned
   airspace, EMC may provide ATC services to aircraft. While aircraft are within mission
   assigned airspace, EMC serves as a monitor agency only to ensure airspace integrity and is
   not responsible for separation of aircraft operating within that airspace.
3.2. Enroute Procedures. Off-Station Flight Procedures are covered in paragraph 1.10.
3.3. Special Use Airspace (SUA) Procedures.
   3.3.1. Aircraft may proceed/return to/from SUA either IFR or VFR and conduct operations
   either VMC or Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC). However, once the aircraft
   enters the assigned airspace, they are responsible for maintaining separation with all other
   participating aircraft.
   3.3.2. Pilots are required to establish operational de-confliction through pre-coordinated
   “shared airspace” agreements or real-time coordination between participating aircraft.
   3.3.3. Once mission aircraft enter their assigned airspace/profile, the controlling agency will
   provide radar monitoring/traffic advisories to the maximum extent possible, based on
   workload and equipment limitations. Mission aircraft working with the Central Control
   Facility (CCF), call sign CHAMBER, will not have radar service terminated. EMC will
   advise pilots whenever their track will take them outside their assigned airspace/profile.
   Example: “(Call sign) WORK NORTH.”
   3.3.4. Aircraft shall provide EMC a 5 minutes Return to Base (RTB) call prior to exiting the
   Restricted/Warning airspace with recovery intentions. This notification is necessary to allow
   sufficient time for coordination and sequencing into the airfield. If aircrew cannot provide 5
   minutes RTB notification or immediate entry into the traffic pattern is not feasible, aircraft
   may be requested to hold within their respective mission airspace until an ATC clearance can
   be issued.
   3.3.5. Due to the volume of aircraft that operate in the vicinity of the Crestview VORTAC,
   mission aircraft operating in this area may broadcast applicable traffic advisories on
   298.025/121.95, which are discrete frequencies established for this purpose. Note: These
   frequencies are separate from Bob Sikes Airport (Crestview) UNICOM (122.95).
   3.3.6. Separation Standards for SUA.
       3.3.6.1. Nonparticipating IFR aircraft. ERCF will separate all IFR aircraft not
       participating in Warning/Restricted Area activity by at least 1,000 ft vertically or 3 NM
       laterally from the SUA peripheral boundary. When more than one radar feed is used by
       ERCF and when using a radar antenna outside of 40 miles from the SUA, the controlling
26                                                         EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013


     agency will separate nonparticipating IFR aircraft from active SUA by at least 1,000 ft
     vertically or 5 NM laterally from the SUA peripheral boundary.
     3.3.6.2. Nonparticipating VFR aircraft. ERCF will separate all VFR aircraft not
     participating in Restricted Area activity from active Restricted Areas by at least 500 ft
     vertically or up to the boundary.
     3.3.6.3. Nonparticipating IFR/VFR aircraft ground mission airspace separation. ERCF
     will separate nonparticipating IFR/VFR aircraft from ground mission activity protected
     airspace by at least 100 ft vertically or up to the boundary.
  3.3.7. W-151/W-470 Operations.
     3.3.7.1. EMC will provide advisories to pilots inbound to W-470/W-151 about aircraft
     operating within W-470/W-151. Once aircraft enter the warning area they shall be
     considered participating aircraft and are responsible for deconfliction from all other
     participating aircraft. Pilots shall advise EMC when deconfliction coordination has been
     accomplished.
     3.3.7.2. Pilots will follow published entry/exit procedures and establish contact with
     flights working inside W-470 or W-151. Flights exiting W-470/W-151 will follow
     published recovery procedures IAW Paragraph 4.35. W-151 airspace is normally entered
     and exited via the 86º0’W, and 86º48’W longitude lines. Pilots entering and exiting the
     airspace are expected to remain within 1 NM of the longitude line. Pilots established
     with the airspace will not fly within 1 NM of the 86º0’W or the 86º48’W longitude lines.
     Pilots on the 86º0’W or the 86º48’W longitude lines will use the 0-4 block (i.e., 100-140
     or FL200-FL240) when traveling southbound and the 5-9 block (i.e., 050-090 or 150-
     FL190) when traveling northbound.
  3.3.8. Airspace Utilization Changes.
     3.3.8.1. Aircraft scheduled to participate in Warning Area operations may request to
     deviate from scheduled times or airspace in order to accomplish mission requirements.
     3.3.8.2. Participating aircraft will advise the Joint Test and Training Operations Control
     Center (JTTOCC) of a requested schedule change through their respective squadron
     Operations Supervisor (Ops Sup), to include; maintenance/weather delays; range
     schedule deviations/modifications and/or intention to work airspace with other missions.
     Airborne aircraft with valid mission numbers may coordinate directly with EMC for
     substitute airspace if scheduled airspace is unusable.
     3.3.8.3. The pilot shall coordinate with the Ops Sup for schedule change requests. The
     Ops Sup will coordinate the request through the JTTOCC via landline at DSN 872-5800.
     3.3.8.4. If coordination through the Ops Sup is not feasible, the pilot will submit their
     request though the JTTOCC via landline at DSN 872-5800 or on frequency 276.0 (Call
     sign “Wolf Call”).
     3.3.8.5. If the JTTOCC is unable to accommodate an airspace scheduling change and the
     pilot still desires to utilize airspace scheduled/in use by another mission, EMC will
     inform the pilot of the aircraft currently in the airspace or scheduled (i.e., call sign,
     number and type aircraft, and working frequency). The pilot is then responsible for
EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013                                                                      27


      coordination with the scheduled aircraft and should advise EMC when deconfliction
      measures have been established.
      3.3.8.6. Workload permitting, participating aircraft may be allowed by EMC to operate
      within airspace not currently in use. However, if a scheduled aircraft requires the use of
      that airspace, the scheduled aircraft has priority and any other aircraft will be required to
      exit the airspace upon notification by EMC.
   3.3.9. MARSA Operations. MARSA operations are not authorized at EAFB, Duke Field or
   any of the airports within the delegated airspace of Eglin Radar Control Facility, with the
   exception of 1 SOW operations in the Hurlburt “H” Area as described in paragraph 2.13 of
   this regulation. Aircraft requesting arrival or departure with other flights will request
   “nonstandard” arrival/departure with call sign(s) of participating aircraft and intentions.
   ATC facilities do not invoke or deny MARSA.
3.4. Recovery Procedures.
   3.4.1. General Recovery Procedures. In general, recovering aircraft shall provide ATC with
   the following information upon initial contact or as soon as possible thereafter:
      3.4.1.1. Appropriate ATIS code.
      3.4.1.2. Type approach/landing requested (e.g., pilots must specifically request Tactical
      Initial.)
      3.4.1.3. Desired Landing Runway.
      3.4.1.4. Special Requirements/Information.
   3.4.2. Nonstandard Formation. If a nonstandard or flight split-up recovery is desired, advise
   ATC as soon as possible. When requesting a nonstandard formation, the pilot shall specify
   the amount and type of spacing required to the maximum extent possible. If approved for
   nonstandard formation, the first aircraft will squawk normal and the last aircraft in the flight
   will change the last two digits of the lead’s squawk to 00 and Mode-C; others will squawk
   standby.
      3.4.2.1. Aircraft shall request radar-in-trail with EMC prior to leaving
      Warning/Restricted Airspace. Aircraft returning from other than Eglin SUA shall make
      request with Eglin Approach Control as soon as possible.
      3.4.2.2. Radar-in-trail flights shall be limited to a maximum of four aircraft and must be
      approved by ATC prior to establishing radar-in-trail spacing. ATC may limit the number
      of aircraft per flight depending on traffic density and SUA activity or complexity.
      3.4.2.3. Radar-in-trail spacing for arrivals shall be defined as no more than 2 NM
      between each element of the flight.
      3.4.2.4. If individual control is requested, the flight elements shall be responsible for
      separation within the flight until standard separation as defined in FAA JO 7110.65, has
      been achieved. Each element shall be given a discrete squawk in the event individual
      control is requested.
      3.4.2.5. A request for radar-in-trail recovery automatically implies that the entire flight
      will make full-stop landings (unless otherwise requested).
28                                                           EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013


     3.4.2.6. Practice approaches while utilizing radar-in-trail spacing shall only be conducted
     in VMC.
  3.4.3. Flight Split-up. Flight split-ups in the terminal area may result in delays due to
  congestion or active restricted airspace. When requesting a flight split-up the flight lead shall
  state the order of recovery, type approach and landing and when ready for the flight split-up.
  3.4.4. Vectors to Initial. Request for vectors to initial will be approved on a case-by-case
  basis. Do not plan to recover to EAFB via vectors to initial.
  3.4.5. Practice Approaches. To prevent pattern saturation at Eglin, the following fields will
  be used for practice approaches to the maximum extent possible:
     3.4.5.1. Duke Field:
         3.4.5.1.1. For helicopters, C-130s, and similar speed aircraft.
         3.4.5.1.2. For VFR pattern work during daylight hours.
     3.4.5.2. Hurlburt Field:
         3.4.5.2.1. For practice instrument approaches.
         3.4.5.2.2. Touch-and-go/low approach proficiency training during Eglin peak traffic
         periods.
  3.4.6. Local Climbout and Radar Traffic Patterns. Aircraft making multiple approaches at
  Eglin, Duke, or Hurlburt shall use the following climbout instructions unless otherwise
  directed by ATC. Aircraft making multiple radar approaches can expect vectors for a pattern
  as depicted in Attachments 13 and 14, or as controller workload dictates. Note: Once
  climbout has been issued for the first approach, that same climbout applies to all subsequent
  approaches unless changed by ATC.
     3.4.6.1. Eglin Local Climbout. ATC phraseology for base assigned aircraft shall be
     “EXECUTE LOCAL CLIMBOUT.” If multiple approaches will be made with tower,
     phraseology shall be “AFTER COMPLETING (type approach), MAINTAIN VFR,
     CONTACT TOWER.” Local climbout will be flown IAW paragraph 4.35.3.2.
     3.4.6.2. Hurlburt Field Local Climbout. ATC phraseology for base assigned aircraft
     shall be “EXECUTE LOCAL CLIMBOUT.” If multiple approaches will be made with
     tower, phraseology shall be “AFTER COMPLETING (type approach), MAINTAIN
     VFR, CONTACT TOWER.”
         3.4.6.2.1. RWY 18: “CROSS DEPARTURE END OF RUNWAY AT OR BELOW
         ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED, THEN CLIMB AND MAINTAIN ONE
         THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND FLY RUNWAY HEADING.”                                    Note:
         Departure end altitude restriction may be deleted if overhead pattern is closed.
         3.4.6.2.2. RWY 36: “CROSS DEPARTURE END OF RUNWAY AT OR BELOW
         ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED, THEN CLIMB AND MAINTAIN ONE
         THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED, AND TURN LEFT HEADING TWO ZERO
         ZERO.” Note: Departure end altitude restriction may be deleted if overhead pattern
         is closed.
EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013                                                                    29


         3.4.6.2.3. Hurlburt Field Mission Climb-Out. Use when mission activity dictates.
         ATC phraseology for base assigned aircraft shall be “EXECUTE MISSION
         CLIMBOUT”.
             3.4.6.2.3.1. RWY 36: “CROSS DEPARTURE END OF RUNWAY AT OR
             BELOW ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THEN CLIMB AND
             MAINTAIN ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND TURN RIGHT
             HEADING ONE FIVE ZERO.” Note: Departure end altitude restriction may be
             deleted if overhead pattern is closed.
  3.4.7. Missed Approach Procedures. Unless otherwise instructed, aircraft flying a published
  IFR approach procedure can expect to execute a missed approach as published. Controllers
  may issue alternate instructions as conditions (weather, traffic, airspace configuration, etc.)
  dictate.
  3.4.8. Automatic Cancellation of IFR. For base assigned or hosted aircraft recovering to the
  VFR pattern (straight-in or overhead), IFR clearance is cancelled automatically when pilot
  reports field in sight or communications are transferred to tower. If unable to maintain
  VMC, the pilot shall advise ATC and request alternate instructions. Unless otherwise
  directed, aircraft remaining within the tower VFR pattern for multiple approaches shall
  maintain their assigned squawk or squawk VFR with altitude. All aircraft will be sequenced
  to the tower patterns, and aircraft shall remain on ERCF’s frequency until instructed to
  contact tower.
  3.4.9. Opposite Direction/Crossing Runway Separation Standards. If the tower display
  workstation (TDW) is inoperative, the radar controller shall assume responsibility for
  maintaining appropriate separation from opposite direction traffic. Aircraft requesting
  opposite direction operations can expect delays until the following restrictions are met:
     3.4.9.1. When both aircraft are IFR:
         3.4.9.1.1. Arrival vs. Departure. Arrival aircraft shall not proceed inbound past a
         point 10 NM from the landing threshold (6 NM or crossing runway) before a
         departing aircraft is airborne and turning onto a course to ensure required separation
         will be maintained.
         3.4.9.1.2. Arrival vs. Arrival. Arrival aircraft shall not proceed inbound past a point
         10 NM from the landing threshold (6 NM for crossing runway) before a preceding
         arriving aircraft has crossed the landing threshold for a full stop or crossed the
         landing threshold and turned onto a course to ensure require separation for a low
         approach or touch and go.
     3.4.9.2. When one or both of the aircraft involved is VFR the above separation standards
     may be reduced to 6 NM for opposite direction and 3 NM for crossing runway—except
     when heavy aircraft are involved.
     3.4.9.3. VFR Pattern Aircraft in the VFR pattern will be held at downwind or restricted
     from turning base until the opposite direction departure is airborne and turned to ensure
     conflict resolution or a preceding opposite direction arrival aircraft has landed.

   4.8.1. Eglin’s ground NAVAID checkpoints are located on TWY D-North, TWY G-East,
   and TWY Q.
4.9. Navigational Aids (NAVAIDs).
   4.9.1. Preventive Maintenance Inspection (PMI). Refer to DoD FLIP for available
   navigational aids and their current PMI schedules for EAFB, Duke Field and all associated
   satellite airports served by Eglin Radar Control Facility. Where no PMI times are published,
   PMI schedules are not on a reoccurring basis or required. All PMI request and response
   times are IAW OSS OI 13-1 on “Air Traffic Control Approach Landing Systems (ATCALS)
   NAVAID Coordination.”
   4.9.2. AMS-2100 Instrument Landing System (ILS) systems Customer Support Team (CST)
   has maintenance responsibility for the AMS-2100 ILS systems. All maintenance action
   items, response time requirements and restoration priorities shall be IAW AFI 13-203
   AFMC_SUP.
   4.9.3. Civil Use of USAF Air Traffic Control/Landing Systems (ATCALS). Civil aircraft
   may use USAF NAVAID facilities at EAFB on a noninterference basis. Practice approaches
   to low approach/go-around are authorized. Requests for services will be considered on an
   individual basis and dependent on controller workload and equipment availability. Approval
   is at the discretion of the ATC WS. For further guidance on civil use of USAF ATCALS, see
   AFI 10-1001, Civil Aircraft Landing Permits.
4.10. Permanently Closed/Unusable Portions of the Airfield. TWY U between RWY 19 and
TWY R is permanently closed and marked with standard closed markings.
4.11. Airfield Lighting.
   4.11.1. See DoD FLIP for available instrument approach lighting systems. All airfield
   lighting will be operated from the Eglin Control Tower, Eglin alternate control tower or by
   Civil Engineering (CE) exterior electric via the airfield lighting control vault.
   4.11.2. Towway A and TWY L are unlit.
4.12. ATIS, Weather Dissemination and Coordination Procedures.
   4.12.1. Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS). EAFB will normally operate the
   ATIS between 0500 - 2200L each day. Additionally, when the wing flying window is
   beyond those times, the ATIS shall be operational at least 30 minutes prior to the first
   departure until the last scheduled arrival has landed.
   4.12.2. Hazardous/Severe Weather Notification Procedures. The 96th Weather Flight (96
   WF) is responsible for monitoring and evaluating weather information and conditions and, as
   necessary, issuing weather statements in the form of weather watches, warnings and
   advisories. AM Ops is responsible for notifying organizations with a flying mission, SOF,
   and organizations in direct support of the flying mission.
   34                                                           EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013


     4.12.3. Lightning Response. When an Observed Warning for lightning within 5 NM is
     issued by 96 WF the following shall apply:
         4.12.3.1. All aircraft maintenance and operations involving explosives that are not within
         a lightning protected facility will be terminated and personnel will seek shelter in a
         vehicle or building until MOCC relays that lightning within 5 NM of the airfield has been
         canceled. See AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards, for more information.
         4.12.3.2. Aircraft located in the chocks with engine(s) running may shut down and
         maintenance personnel and aircrew will take cover. The aircrew may elect to remain in
         the aircraft until the warning is lifted; however, maintenance personnel will take cover
         immediately or after engine shutdown.
         4.12.3.3. Aircraft taxiing for takeoff may either continue taxiing to the End of Runway
         (EOR) or taxi back to hold short of their parking spot until the warning is lifted. If the
         EOR inspection has been completed, then the pilot may elect to continue taxiing for
         departure.
         4.12.3.4. Aircraft landing will wait in EOR until the warning is lifted.
         4.12.3.5. Definitions: See Table 4.1.

Observed WARNING for                 Lightning is OBSERVED within 5 NM of the airfield
Lightning
         4.12.3.6. The 96 MXG/CC or designated representative is the only approval authority for
         authorizing maintenance personnel to conduct maintenance action on the airfield, to
         include shutdown, taxi, towing, or EOR activity, when there is lightning within 5 NM of
         EAFB. The 96 TW, 33 FW, 53 WG, and 9 SOS assigned aircraft will utilize their
         respective maintenance supervision chains of command for direction. If an aircrew
         determines that the aircraft must be shut down and maintenance personnel have already
         taken cover, they will notify the SOF/Squadron Operations Supervisor/Dispatcher of their
         fuel remaining before reaching a critically low fuel level to allow time for 96 MXG
         coordination. The SOF will assess the situation and consult with the 96 OG/CC (or
         designated representative) to determine the best course of action. Aircrew will not allow
         an engine to flameout because of a low fuel state. When directed to taxi or shutdown,
         aircrew will complete the required actions as quickly as safety allows, exposing the
         minimum number of personnel to these weather conditions.
            4.12.3.6.1. The following procedures will be accomplished when aircraft shutdown
            has been approved by the 96 MXG/CC or designated representative: Chock the tires

          (no rollover), install external safety pins, shut down engine(s) with fuel catchers (if
          applicable), ground aircraft, and close the canopy. Maintenance personnel will
          perform the minimum essential tasks to safely shut down/secure the aircraft then
          immediately take cover.
      4.12.3.7. The 33 FW has specific information regarding coordination during observed
      lightning conditions in 33FW OI 21-118. F-35 aircraft taxiing prior to takeoff or after
      landing will return immediately to a lightning protected shelter when an Observed
      Warning for lightning within 25 NM is issued.

       4.26.5.4. ALPHA Trim Pad from 1700L to 0700L (24 hours on weekends and holidays).
       Use shall be coordinated with the 96 TW/MOCC.
4.27. Procedures for Suspending, Opening, and/or Closing the Runway.
   4.27.1. The Tower WS/SC and AM Ops have authority to suspend runway operations
   anytime there is an observed or reported hazardous condition or situation. Appropriate
   NOTAMs will be sent for closures of the runway that exceed 30 minutes. Only AM Ops has
   the authority to close or open the runway.
   4.27.2. Runway operations will be suspended to the affected runway during aircraft arresting
   system (BAK-12) changes necessary for the runway change. Aircraft may be allowed to taxi
   over a BAK-12 cable that has not been secured with tie-down ropes as long as it has been
   connected and properly tensioned and the pilot is informed that the cable is not tied down.
4.28. Airfield Inspections/Checks. Airfield inspections/checks are conducted by the AFM,
DAFM, NAMO, NAMT, AMOS, AMSL or civilian equivalents to ensure a safe operational
environment.
4.29. Aircraft Towing Procedures.
   4.29.1. All 9 SOS/Aero Club/Transient Aircraft. Prior coordination is required with AM
   Ops for all aircraft tow operations at EAFB. AM Ops will relay this information to ATC.
   Direct two-way radio contact and approval from Eglin Ground Control is required prior to
   any aircraft being towed across any controlled movement area.
   4.29.2. 96 TW/33 FW. Prior coordination with AM Ops or ATC is not required. Direct
   two-way radio contact and approval from Eglin Ground Control is required prior to any
   aircraft being towed across any controlled movement area.
4.30. Aeromedical Aircraft Arrival Procedures.
   4.30.1. AM Ops shall coordinate crash/rescue stand-by protection for aeromedical aircraft if
   required.
   4.30.2. Eglin Tower shall notify AM Ops when arriving aeromedical airlift aircraft reach 15
   NM from the airport and relay any information requested by the pilot.

4.32. Taxi Procedures. Eglin Tower is not responsible for ground traffic operating in those
areas not visible from the tower. See Attachment 2 for those locations.
   4.32.1. Aircraft will change to Ground Control frequency after exiting the runway surface.
   Locally assigned aircraft (except Aero Club aircraft) shall:
      4.32.1.1. Monitor Ground Control frequency and give way to other aircraft taxiing on the
      main taxiway, emergency response vehicles, and taxi toward their parking locations.
      4.32.1.2. Notify Ground Control before changing to another radio frequency while
      taxiing unless switching to Tower Control frequency for departure.
   4.32.2. RWY 1/30 Departure Taxi Procedures. Fighter aircraft departing RWY 1 or RWY
   30 shall taxi down the runway at least 500 ft (700 ft if using full afterburner) before starting
   takeoff roll to limit the effects of jet blast at the apex. When two or more aircraft depart
   simultaneously ensure the last element in the flight is at least 500 ft (700 ft if using full
   afterburner) down the runway before starting takeoff roll. C-130 and larger aircraft shall taxi
   at least 700 ft down the runway before beginning engine run-up. Note: If operational
   necessity requires the use of the entire runway, pilots shall make the request with ground
   prior to takeoff.
   4.32.3. RWY 30 (at TWY D) Crossing. To expedite aircraft taxiing across RWY 30 at
   TWY D, the following procedures may be used:
      4.32.3.1. If the pilot of the aircraft on landing roll, or the pilot of the last aircraft to land
      from a formation, advises tower they can exit RWY 30 at TWY E (“TOWER, (call sign),
 44                                                          EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013


      ECHO (North/South) TURN OFF”), tower may allow ground traffic across RWY 30 at
      TWY D.
      4.32.3.2. If there is known ground traffic at TWY D, tower may initiate this action by
      asking the pilot after landing roll, "(Call sign), VERIFY ECHO (NORTH/SOUTH)
      TURN OFF?" These procedures apply only when traffic is recovering on RWY 30, and
      landing and taxiing aircraft is base assigned.
   4.32.4. Military and general aviation aircraft are not authorized to taxi into the Northwest
   Florida Regional Airport area without prior permission from the Northwest Florida Regional
   Airport Manager, obtained through the Eglin Airfield Manager.
4.33. Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS). Reduced separation is authorized by the
AFI 13-203_AFMCSUP and may be applied to all Air Force, Air Force Reserve and Air
National Guard aircraft. For non-AF aircraft, RSRS may be authorized under a letter of
agreement between the unit commander and the 96 OG/CC.
   4.33.1. Controllers treat aircraft within the same formation (whether similar or dissimilar) as
   a single aircraft, and do not apply reduced runway separation standards. Separation between
   aircraft within a formation is the responsibility of the flight leader and pilots of the other
   aircraft in the flight (JO 7110.65, Pilot/Controller Glossary). However, pilots will prudently
   adhere to the same runway separation standards as required in Table 4.5. Air Traffic
   Controllers must always be able to see the aircraft involved and determine distances by
   reference to suitable landmarks (distance markers, taxiways, etc.)

    4.33.2. When maintaining visual separation or operating under VFR, pilots are responsible
    for wake turbulence separation, and controllers must provide appropriate cautionary wake
    turbulence advisories. When aircraft are operating IFR or under ATC instructions, air traffic
    controllers must ensure standard wake turbulence separation.
    4.33.3. Reduced same runway separation is not authorized under the following conditions:
         4.33.3.1. Any situation involving an emergency aircraft.
         4.33.3.2. Non-AF aircraft, unless authorized under an LOA.
         4.33.3.3. Any aircraft “Cleared for the option”, “Cleared stop-and-go”, low approach
         behind a touch-and-go, or a touch-and-go behind a full stop.
         4.33.3.4. When braking action reports of “poor” or “nil” are reported.

4.34. General Departure Procedures.
   4.34.1. Eglin Standard Departure. IFR aircraft initially departing EAFB shall be issued the
   following departure instructions by Clearance Delivery: “FLY RUNWAY HEADING,
   MAINTAIN THREE THOUSAND, EXPECT (altitude) ONE ZERO MINUTES AFTER
   DEPARTURE….”
      4.34.1.1. IFR aircraft issued a heading to fly on departure shall initiate their turn within 1
      NM from the departure end of the runway, or advise ATC if unable.
   4.34.2. VFR Overhead Pattern Protection. All departures from EAFB shall maintain at or
   below 1,000 ft MSL, and Hurlburt Field shall maintain at or below 1,200 ft MSL, until the
   departure end of the runway to protect the VFR overhead pattern, unless otherwise directed.
   4.34.3. Quick Climbs/Max Climbs/Unrestricted Climbs. If a nonstandard rate of climb is
   desired, make the request with Ground Control on initial contact. If approved (by ERCF),
   the requirement to fly runway heading is still in effect, unless alternate heading is given with
   the approval.
   4.34.4. Two minute call. All locally based or hosted aircraft departing IFR will call to Eglin
   Ground: “(Call sign), 2 minutes” prior to departure.
   4.34.5. EAFB Intersection Departures (VFR and IFR). Intersection departures are
   authorized from all taxiway intersections except from TWY M, due to obstructed visibility
   from the control tower. Eglin Ground Control will not issue runway distance remaining to
   locally based C-130 and Aero Club aircraft making an intersection departure. Note: Aero
   Club aircraft are expected to depart from TWY N for RWY 19 departures and TWY J for
   RWY 1 departures. Aero Club multiengine aircraft will depart from TWY P for RWY 19
   departures and TWY W for RWY 1 departures.
      4.34.5.1. The runway distances remaining from each of the taxiways at Eglin are as
      depicted in Table 4.6.

  4.34.6. Immediate Takeoff Clearance. When issued an immediate takeoff clearance, pilots
  are expected to begin takeoff roll within 20 seconds of clearance receipt. Tower shall advise
  the pilot in advance to "EXPECT IMMEDIATE DEPARTURE." If the pilot is unable to
  comply, they shall notify the tower prior to taxiing onto the runway.
  4.34.7. Abbreviated Departure Clearance. Eglin Clearance Delivery shall issue an
  abbreviated IFR clearance to all local aircraft with Eglin stereo route flight plans. Example:
  “(Call sign), EGLIN CLEARANCE DELIVERY, CLEARED TO EAFB VIA THE VPS
  (Stereo Route Number) DEPARTURE AS FILED, (departure procedure), (altitude data in
  order flown), (frequency and beacon code information).”
  4.34.8. Airborne pickup procedures.
     4.34.8.1. Upon initial contact with ground control, the pilot will advise ATC of intention
     to use an airborne pickup.
     4.34.8.2. When ready for takeoff, contact tower and include the airborne pickup request.
     Example: PILOT: "CUDA ONE, NUMBER ONE RUNWAY ONE NINER, REQUEST
     AIRBORNE PICKUP." TOWER: “CUDA ONE, RUNWAY ONE NINER LINE UP
     AND WAIT” or “CUDA ONE, AIRBORNE PICKUP APPROVED, MAKE (left/right)
     CLOSED, RUNWAY ONE NINER WIND CALM, CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF.”
     4.34.8.3. Airborne pickups including heavy aircraft, such as tankers, will be coordinated
     in advance with ATC. When cleared for takeoff, clearance for the airborne pickup and
     closed pattern direction will be issued by the tower.
     4.34.8.4. Both aircraft involved in this maneuver will remain on tower frequency until
     instructed to change to departure.
     4.34.8.5. The first aircraft to depart will execute a left/right turn (as directed by ATC) to
     inside downwind. The aircraft will configure as required/desired, execute a base turn
     (radio call to tower not required), and roll out offset from the runway left or right as
     necessary.
     4.34.8.6. The second aircraft will release brakes and the airborne aircraft will execute the
     join up. When both aircraft are at a safe altitude, tower will direct them to change to
     departure.
     4.34.8.7. ATC may have first airborne aircraft “report initial for airborne pickup/carry
     through” if conditions warrant. Additionally, the pilot may request “re-entry to initial for
     airborne pickup” if desired (subject to ATC approval).
     4.34.8.8. Restrictions.
         4.34.8.8.1. Simultaneous operations to crossing runway are prohibited during
         airborne pickup operations.
         4.34.8.8.2. Weather minimums for executing the airborne pickup procedure shall be
         a 2,100 ft MSL ceiling and 3 statute miles (SM) visibility.
         4.34.8.8.3. Aircraft will slow to no lower than final approach speed during the
         airborne pickup.

         4.34.8.8.4. Minimum altitude during the airborne pickup is 200 ft AGL unless
         approved by test and safety review boards for specific test mission requirements.
4.35. General Recovery Procedures.
   4.35.1. South Flow Recovery Procedures.
   4.35.1.1. North Transition: Proceed to EBETH (DWG012/14) at or above 3,000 ft MSL
   then proceed direct to JAIL (DWG 330/07) to cross JAIL between 2,200 and 3,000 ft MSL,
   then proceed to GATE (DWG 347/04) to cross GATE between 2,100 and 3,000 ft MSL (See
   Attachment 16). Descend to pattern altitude and proceed to initial, straight-in, or as
   instructed by tower. If recovering IFR, proceed to EBETH to pick up the ILS to RWY 19.
   Cross EBETH at or above 3,000 ft MSL.
      4.35.1.2. East Transition: Intercept the 86º0’W longitude line and track 360 deg to
      KOAST (DWG 120/30) (See Attachment 16). Cross GULFF (DWG 145/047) between
      15,000 and 19,000 ft MSL; cross KOAST between 6,000 and 9,000 ft MSL, then turn left
      and proceed to DDUNE (DWG 180/08) via course 286 deg; cross DDUNE at or above
      6,000 ft MSL, then proceed with the DDUNE recovery.
      4.35.1.3. West Transition: Intercept the 86º48’W longitude line and track 360 deg to
      BIECH (DWG 236/17) (See Attachment 16). Cross CHEAF (DWG 207/30) between
      15,000 and 19,000 ft MSL; cross BIECH between 6,000 and 9,000 ft MSL, then turn
      right and proceed to DDUNE (DWG 180/08) via course 083 deg; cross DDUNE at or
      above 6,000 ft MSL, then proceed with the DDUNE recovery.
      4.35.1.4. DDUNE Recovery. This procedure is utilized during south flow (RWY 12/19)
      operations to return aircraft to the VFR pattern. Aircraft will be cleared and fly the
      recovery as depicted. IFR clearance is automatically cancelled when the aircraft reports
      the field in sight. Aircraft reporting the field in sight are expected to fly GATE to initial
      unless otherwise coordinated. On initial contact with tower, specify position and landing
      intentions (i.e., “EGLIN TOWER, (call sign), DDUNE INITIAL RWY 12 OPTION”). If
      unable to proceed VFR by GATE, continue outbound on the DWG 347R for an
      instrument approach.
         4.35.1.4.1. Proceed to DWG via DWG R-180; cross DWG at 4,000 ft MSL (See
         Attachment 16). At DWG, track outbound on DWG R-347 to GATE (DWG
         347/04). Cross GATE between 2,100 and 3,000 ft MSL. Descend to pattern altitude
         and proceed to initial, straight-in, or as instructed by tower.
      4.35.1.5. Whiskey Hotel Recovery: This procedure is designed to provide a VFR
      recovery to EAFB during RWY 12/19 operations. The minimum weather for this
      recovery is a 3,500 ft MSL ceiling and 3 SM visibility. (See Attachment 17.)
         4.35.1.5.1. R-2915B activities may preclude Whiskey Hotel recoveries.
         4.35.1.5.2. Once approved, IFR clearances and radar arrival sequencing are
         automatically cancelled. Radar flight following service shall continue until
         communications transfer to Eglin Tower.
         4.35.1.5.3. Aircraft shall cross the Hurlburt TACAN (Channel 45x) at or above 3,000
         ft MSL, cross abeam B-71 at 2,500 ft MSL, and then descend to 1,600 ft MSL for
         initial or proceed straight-in.
EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013                                                                 49


         4.35.1.5.4. Aircraft shall remain clear of R-2915A throughout the recovery.
     4.35.1.6. Full-stop landings on RWY 19 are authorized with full-stop landings on RWY
     12 for all aircraft. Traffic information will be issued by tower and must be acknowledged
     from each aircraft.
  4.35.2. North Flow Recovery Procedures. North Ops via EBETH for IFR or VFR recoveries
  to RWY 1/30. This procedure is designed to provide IFR or VFR recoveries during RWY
  1/30 operations. Aircraft shall remain on ERCF frequency until instructed to contact tower.
  The VFR portion of the Eglin North Recovery shall not be flown when the ceiling is less than
  2,100 ft AGL. (See Attachment 18)
  4.35.2.1. North Transition. Intercept the DWG R-012 and track inbound to DWG. Cross
  DWG R-012/14 DME (EBETH) at 6,000 ft MSL; cross DWG between 4,000 and 6,000 ft
  MSL (See Attachment 18). At DWG, track outbound to DDUNE (DWG 180/08) via R-180;
  cross DWG 180/04 between 2,100 and 5,000 ft MSL; cross DDUNE between 1,600 and
  5,000 ft MSL. Then recover via procedures stated below:
         4.35.2.1.1. VFR Recovery. Descend to pattern altitude and proceed to initial, VFR
         straight-in, or as instructed by ATC. If unable to proceed VMC, aircraft shall advise
         ATC and proceed with the IFR portion of the recovery.
         4.35.2.1.2. IFR Recovery. In the absence of further ATC instructions, depart
         DDUNE heading 133 deg to join the DWG 12 DME arc. Upon joining the arc,
         proceed with the published ILS or TACAN approach. Maintain 3,000 ft MSL
         throughout the 12 DME arc until passing the lead radial for the intended approach.
     4.35.2.2. East Transition. If a heading or restriction is not assigned by EMC, intercept
     the 86º0’W longitude line and track 360 deg to KOAST (DWG 120/30). (See
     Attachment 18) Cross GULFF (DWG 145/57) between 15,000 and 19,000 ft MSL;
     cross KOAST between 6,000 and 9,000 ft MSL, then turn left and proceed inbound via
     DWG R-120. Cross JAMMM (DWG 120/18) at or above 3,000 ft MSL. Then depart
     JAMMM and join ILS or TACAN procedures as stated below:
         4.35.2.2.1. ILS Approach. Depart JAMMM to join the procedure at DWG 120/17
         and proceed with the approach.
         4.35.2.2.2. TACAN Approach. Depart JAMMM heading 280 deg, intercept the
         DWG R-133 and proceed with the approach.
     4.35.2.3. West Transition. Intercept the 86º48’W longitude line and track 360 deg to
     BIECH (DWG 236/17). (See Attachment 18) Cross CHEAF (DWG 207/32) between
     15,000 and 19,000 ft MSL; cross BIECH 6,000 and 9,000 ft MSL, then turn right and
     proceed to DEJAH (DWG 218/11) via course 083 deg; cross DEJAH at 3,000 ft MSL,
     then proceed to DDUNE (DWG 180/08). Cross DDUNE between 2,000 and 1,600 ft
     MSL. Then recover via procedures stated below:
         4.35.2.3.1. VFR Recovery. Descend to pattern altitude and proceed to initial, VFR
         straight-in, or as instructed by ATC. If unable to proceed VMC, aircraft shall advise
         ATC and proceed with the IFR portion of the recovery
         4.35.2.3.2. IFR Recovery. In the absence of further ATC instructions, depart
         DDUNE heading 133 deg to join the DWG 12 DME arc. Upon joining the arc,
50                                                         EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013


         proceed with the published ILS or TACAN approach. Climb and maintain 3,000 ft
         MSL throughout the 12 DME arc until passing the lead radial for the intended
         approach.
  4.35.3. Local Climbout and Radar Traffic Patterns. Aircraft making multiple approaches at
  Eglin, Duke or Hurlburt shall use the following climbout instructions unless otherwise
  directed by ATC. Aircraft making multiple radar approaches can expect vectors for a pattern
  as depicted in Attachments 13 and 14, or as controller workload dictates.
     4.35.3.1. ATC phraseology for base assigned aircraft shall be “EXECUTE LOCAL
     CLIMBOUT.” If multiple approaches will be made with tower, phraseology shall be
     “AFTER COMPLETING (type approach), MAINTAIN VFR, CONTACT TOWER.”
     4.35.3.2. Eglin Local Climbout:
         4.35.3.2.1. RWY 1: “AFTER COMPLETING (type approach), CROSS
         DEPARTURE END OF THE RUNWAY AT OR BELOW ONE THOUSAND,
         CLIMB AND MAINTAIN THREE THOUSAND, THEN TURN RIGHT HEADING
         ONE ONE ZERO, CONTACT ARRIVAL 124.25/290.5/LOCAL CHANNEL 7.”
         4.35.3.2.2. RWY 12:   “AFTER COMPLETING (type approach), CROSS
         DEPARTURE END OF THE RUNWAY AT OR BELOW ONE THOUSAND, FLY
         RUNWAY HEADING, CLIMB AND MAINTAIN FOUR THOUSAND, AT
         THREE DME TURN LEFT HEADING ZERO THREE ZERO, CONTACT
         ARRIVAL 124.25/290.5/LOCAL CHANNEL 7.”
         4.35.3.2.3. RWY 19: “AFTER COMPLETING (type approach), CROSS
         DEPARTURE END OF THE RUNWAY AT OR BELOW ONE THOUSAND,
         TURN RIGHT HEADING TWO SEVEN ZERO, CLIMB AND MAINTAIN
         THREE THOUSAND, CONTACT ARRIVAL 124.25/290.5/LOCAL CHANNEL 7.”
         4.35.3.2.4. RWY 30: “AFTER COMPLETING (type approach), CROSS
         DEPARTURE END OF THE RUNWAY AT OR BELOW ONE THOUSAND,
         TURN LEFT HEADING ONE EIGHT ZERO, CLIMB AND MAINTAIN THREE
         THOUSAND, CONTACT ARRIVAL 124.25/290.5/LOCAL CHANNEL 7.”
  4.35.4. VFR Traffic Patterns. Basic weather minimums for all VFR traffic patterns are
  ceiling 500 feet above the pattern altitude and 3 SM visibility. Weather should allow use of
  visual entry/reentry points for the respective runway in use (GATE or BAY). The Tower WS
  or Eglin SOF may close the pattern when deemed necessary even if the weather is above
  VFR minimums due to obscured visibility or operational necessity, such as traffic saturation,
  poor tower visibility, and/or equipment limitations. The traffic patterns described below are
  standard patterns. However, the Eglin/Duke Control Towers may direct use of a traffic
  patterns other than as described herein when deemed necessary. On initial contact with the
  tower, specify position and landing intentions (e.g., “EGLIN TOWER, (Call sign), DDUNE
  FOR INITIAL RWY 12, OPTION”).
  4.35.5. Overhead Pattern. Overhead pattern altitude is 1,600 ft MSL with 45 deg entries and
  a 3 to 5 NM initial (See Attachment 19). Airspeed in the overhead pattern is 300 knots
  indicated airspeed (KIAS) (Exception: 350 KIAS for tactical initials). The overhead pattern
  shall be open to only one runway at a time. When RWY 12/19 are in use, overhead patterns
EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013                                                                     51


  shall normally be flown to RWY 12 (See Attachment 21). When RWY 1/30 are in use,
  overhead patterns shall normally be made to RWY 30 (See Attachment 22). Note: Traffic
  conditions permitting, Eglin Tower may approve other overhead patterns at pilot request.
  The standard overhead patterns are as follows:
     4.35.5.1. RWY 1. Left turns.
     4.35.5.2. RWY 19. Right turns.
     4.35.5.3. RWY 12. Left turns.
     4.35.5.4. RWY 30. Left turns.
  4.35.6. Tactical Initial. Tactical initial request shall be made on initial contact with the
  control tower. Tower has the authority to approve or deny this request. If denied, aircraft
  must be no further than 500 ft separation prior to reaching the 3 to 5 NM initial point. The
  following procedures shall be adhered to for aircraft approved to recover tactical initial:
     4.35.6.1. RWY 12/30: Aircraft will remain no further than 4,000 ft line abreast with the
     flight lead lined up on RWY 12/30 with the wingman lined up on Nomad Way, south of
     the runway centerline.
     4.35.6.2. RWY 1/19: Aircraft will remain no further than 4,000 ft line abreast with the
     flight lead lined up on RWY 1/19 with the wingman east of the runway centerline.
  4.35.7. VFR Straight-in. Altitude for a VFR straight-in approach is 1,100 ft MSL on a 3 to 5
  NM final. When entering from a downwind or GATE (DWG 347/04), aircraft will begin
  their descent when turning base and be established at 1,100 ft MSL prior to turning final.
  RWY 30 south straight-in entries shall maintain 2,100 ft MSL until BAY (DWG 149/03) to
  avoid Destin Airport traffic, then descend to 1,100 ft MSL. Maneuvering to the southeast
  may be required to execute RWY 30 straight-in approaches.
  4.35.8. Reentries. Reentry is used for re-sequencing and spacing requirements. The radio
  call for reentries is (“(Call sign), REENTER”). When directed to, or when requesting to
  reenter, aircraft flying straight through initial will climb and maintain 2,100 ft MSL until the
  departure end of the runway. Aircraft on climbout after a low-approach/touch-and-go will
  maintain at or below 1,000 ft MSL until the departure end of the runway and clear of inside
  downwind traffic. All aircraft reentering will turn crosswind at the departure end of the
  runway and climb/maintain 2,100 ft MSL. Aircraft will turn to outside downwind so as to fly
  outside downwind approximately twice the distance from the runway as inside downwind.
  Aircraft will remain within 4 NM of the airport when reentering the pattern. The following
  are the standard reentry procedures for RWY 12/30 and RWY 1/19:
     4.35.8.1. The standard reentry point for RWY 12 is GATE. Aircraft turning to an
     outside downwind will climb and maintain 2,100 ft MSL and execute the left turn direct
     to GATE. Aircraft will remain south of the approach end of RWY 19 until west of RWY
     19 (i.e. aircraft will not extend crosswind north of the approach end of RWY 19 or they
     will be a potential conflict to straight-in traffic). At GATE, the aircraft will turn to make
     a 45 deg entry to 3 NM initial while descending to 1,600 ft MSL. If reentering for a VFR
     straight-in, apply VFR straight-in altitude procedures described in paragraph 4.35.7.
     4.35.8.2. The standard reentry point for RWY 30 is BAY. On crosswind, aircraft will
     climb and maintain 2,100 ft MSL and turn left to outside downwind to fly direct to BAY.
52                                                             EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013


     At BAY, the aircraft will turn to make a 45 deg entry to 3 NM initial while descending to
     1,600 ft MSL. If reentering for a VFR straight-in, apply VFR straight-in altitude
     procedures described in paragraph 4.35.7.
     4.35.8.3. The standard reentry point for RWY 19 is GATE. On crosswind, aircraft will
     climb and maintain 2,100 ft MSL and turn right to outside downwind to fly direct to
     GATE. Aircraft will remain east of the approach end of RWY 12 until north of RWY 12
     (aircraft will not extend crosswind west of the approach end of RWY 12 or they will be a
     potential conflict to straight-in traffic). At GATE, the aircraft will turn to make a 45 deg
     entry to 3 NM initial while descending to 1,600 ft MSL. If reentering for a VFR straight-
     in, apply VFR straight-in altitude procedures described in paragraph 4.35.7.
     4.35.8.4. The standard reentry point for RWY 1 is SHALIMAR BRIDGE (DWG
     238/4.2, or 30°26'26"N 86°35'23"W). On crosswind, aircraft will climb and maintain
     2,100 ft MSL and turn left to outside downwind to fly direct to SHALIMAR BRIDGE.
     At SHALIMAR BRIDGE, the aircraft will turn to make a 45 deg entry to 3 NM initial
     while descending to 1,600 ft MSL. If reentering for a VFR straight-in, apply VFR
     straight-in altitude procedures described in paragraph 4.35.10.4.
  4.35.9. Go Around. Aircraft instructed “(Call sign), GO AROUND, (Reason, time
  permitting)” will execute the following procedures:
     4.35.9.1. Aircraft will fly straight ahead or as directed by the tower. (e.g., “(Call sign),
     GO AROUND, SOUTH SIDE OF RWY, AIRCRAFT ON RUNWAY”) and maintain at
     or below 1,000 ft MSL until departure end.
  4.35.10. Breakouts.    Breakout procedures will be used only for traffic conflicts,
  emergencies, or landing gear problems and are not to be confused with reentry procedures.
  The radio call for breakouts is “(Call sign) BREAKOUT” or when initiated by the pilot,
  “(Call sign) BREAKING OUT.” Aircraft will execute the following breakout procedures
  when directed by Eglin Tower or as required. (See Attachments 21 and 22)
     4.35.10.1. Aircraft conducting overhead approaches: Aircraft established on initial have
     priority over aircraft 45 deg to initial. If a conflict exists, aircraft on 45 deg to initial will
     immediately climb to 2,100 ft MSL, notify tower of the climb to 2,100 ft MSL (“(Call
     sign), BREAKING-OUT”) and turn to parallel/overfly the runway. Continue runway
     heading until departure end, then follow Eglin Tower’s instructions. If no instructions
     are received, extend upwind one-half NM past the departure end of the runway and turn
     crosswind. Clear traffic reentering and turn to outside downwind. Once established on
     outside downwind, follow the normal reentry procedures for the runway in use and
     expect further tower instructions at reentry points.
     4.35.10.2. Aircraft Established on Downwind. When directed by Eglin Tower to
     breakout, or when a pilot initiates a breakout from inside downwind, the aircraft will
     climb and maintain 2,100 ft MSL, immediately turn and proceed to the reentry point for
     the runway in use. The pilot must check for aircraft established on outside downwind.
     RWY 12/19, if a conflict exists with an aircraft on outside downwind the aircraft
     breaking out maneuver to follow the outside downwind traffic to GATE. RWY 30, after
     clearing outside downwind, climb and maintain 2,100 ft MSLto avoid Destin Airport
     traffic and follow any outside downwind traffic to BAY. RWY 1, after clearing outside
EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013                                                                       53


     downwind, climb and maintain 2,100 ft MSL and follow any outside downwind traffic to
     SHALIMAR BRIDGE. At GATE/BAY/SHALIMAR BRIDGE, the aircraft will follow
     the normal reentry procedures or proceed as directed by Eglin Tower personnel.
     4.35.10.3. Aircraft Established on Base Turn: Aircraft on a straight-in have priority over
     aircraft in the overhead pattern. Aircraft that have commenced a base turn and perceive a
     traffic conflict (or have an aircraft malfunction) will not break out but instead will
     continue the turn to the runway in use while maneuvering to avoid straight-in traffic and
     immediately inform Eglin Tower (“(Call sign), GOING AROUND”). If possible, once
     aircraft separation is assured, offset to the inside of the runway in use (left side for both
     RWY 12/30 and RWY 1). Aircraft will maintain at or below 1,000 ft MSL until
     departure end of runway, and request closed, reenter, or proceed as directed by Eglin
     Tower.
     4.35.10.4. Aircraft Established on Straight-in Approach: Aircraft established on a
     straight-in approach have priority over aircraft in the overhead traffic pattern and will
     continue with the approach while monitoring base turn traffic that is maneuvering to
     resolve the conflict. If straight-in traffic must also maneuver to ensure flight path
     separation, aircraft shall clear prior to maneuvering to avoid potential conflicts with other
     aircraft in the pattern After maneuvering, parallel the runway, remain below 1,000 ft
     MSL until the departure end of the runway and proceed as directed by Eglin Tower.
     4.35.10.5. Eglin Apex Separation. When an aircraft is on base leg or on a straight-in
     final and the potential exists for a conflict at the Eglin “Apex”, aircraft will be issued the
     conflicting traffic information and instructed to “EXPECT MIDFIELD CLOSED” as a
     last means of providing “Apex” separation. Pilots who inform the tower they are unable
     to accept a midfield closed can expect to be broken out and instructed to reenter the
     traffic pattern. If, after the aircraft turns final, it is determined that a midfield closed is
     not required, tower shall advise the aircraft to make a normal closed (departure end) and
     issue applicable traffic.
         4.35.10.5.1. ATC shall approve closed traffic requests by stating, “LEFT/RIGHT
         CLOSED TRAFFIC APPROVED.” Pilots shall not begin a crosswind turn until
         the departure end of the runway unless specifically directed or approved by the
         tower to execute an earlier turn. Pilots may execute an earlier turn ONLY if ATC
         states “PRESENT POSITION LEFT/RIGHT CLOSED TRAFFIC APPROVED” or
         “MIDFIELD LEFT/RIGHT CLOSED TRAFFIC APPROVED.” All aircraft entering
         a closed pattern shall maintain at or below 1,000 ft MSL until departure end of the
         runway or established in the turn if cleared closed prior to the departure end to protect
         the VFR overhead pattern.
  4.35.11. Navy Pattern. A Navy pattern to RWY 12 is established at 1,100 ft MSL for use by
  Department of the Navy (DoN) aircraft. All DoN aircraft shall fly a 1,600 ft MSL overhead
  pattern for their initial recovery. If desired, DoN aircraft can request to remain at 1,100 ft
  MSL for subsequent patterns by stating, “REQUEST CARRIER CLOSED” while on the go
  after their initial approach.
     4.35.11.1. If ATC approves this request, tower will state, “NAVY CLOSED
     APPROVED.” After receiving this approval, the DoN aircraft will make a present
 54                                                           EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013


       position left turn to downwind at 1,100 ft MSL and will remain west of TWY M at
       all times.
       4.35.11.2. If ATC denies this request for traffic or other reasons, tower will state,
       “UNABLE NAVY CLOSED, LEFT CLOSED TRAFFIC APPROVED.” With this
       instruction, the DoN aircraft will remain at or below 1,000 ft MSL until the departure end
       of the runway. After turning crosswind, climb and maintain 1,600 ft MSL prior to
       entering downwind at 1,600 ft MSL. If desired, after the DoN aircraft has crossed RWY
       19 westbound, the pilot can request to descend to 1,100 ft MSL by stating, “REQUEST
       DESCENT TO NAVY PATTERN.” ATC may approve this request by stating,
       “DESCENT TO NAVY PATTERN APPROVED.” If the request is approved, the DoN
       aircraft will then descend to 1,100 ft MSL. ATC may deny the request by stating,
       “UNABLE DESCENT TO NAVY PATTERN, (reason if time permitting)” or
       “UNABLE, REMAIN PATTERN ALTITUDE, (reason if time permitting.)”
       4.35.11.3. ATC will not assume that DoN aircraft desire a carrier pattern; aircraft must
       specifically request a Navy pattern using the verbiage above.
4.36. Simulated Flameout (SFO) Approaches. The overhead simulated flameout (OH SFO),
and the straight-in simulated flameout (SI SFO) approaches will be conducted between the hours
of sunrise to sunset and only during periods of low density traffic (at the discretion of the Tower
WS). To the maximum extent possible, SFOs shall be requested prior to RTB due to the
increased coordination required. In addition, tower personnel may disapprove or cancel the
procedure whenever they deem it necessary for safety of flight. Approval of an SFO by the
tower does not absolve the pilot from the responsibility to comply with VFR see and avoid
requirements. Participating aircraft are considered to have canceled IFR upon communications
transfer to tower. SFO airspace is defined as a 4 NM radius from center of the airport from
surface up to and including 10,000 ft MSL unless otherwise coordinated.
   4.36.1. Weather and Runway Requirements. Official reported weather at the airport to
   which the approach is conducted will be ceiling at least 1,000 ft above the requested high or
   low key altitude and visibility of at least 5 SM.
   4.36.2. Duke Field is the primary choice for SFO training based on traffic pattern congestion
   at Eglin. Every attempt should be made to conduct SFO practice approaches to Duke Field
   RWY 18/36. When accomplishing SFOs at Eglin, RWY 12/30 is the primary runway but
   will be dependent on existing traffic and/or controller workload.
   4.36.3. SI SFO primary location is Duke Field RWY 18. EAFB RWY 30 can be approved
   depending on traffic and/or controller workload.
   4.36.4. OH SFO Pattern Procedures. (See Attachment 23)
       4.36.4.1. RWY 12 OH SFO Procedures: From low approach or initial straight through
       an aircraft will make a right hand climbing turnout at the departure end in order to
       execute a 360 deg left turning SFO. Pilot will report high key with: “(Call sign), HIGH
       KEY” or “(Call sign), HIGH KEY, ORBIT.” If required to orbit at high key the aircraft
       will initiate a left hand turn at high key altitude and report high key when over the desired
       touchdown point. When executing an SFO from high key, a left 360 deg SFO will be
       performed.
EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013                                                                      55


     4.36.4.2. RWY 1/19 OH SFO Procedures: SFOs to RWY 1/19 will normally only be
     flown during single runway operations when Duke Field is not available. The ATC WS
     has the final authority to authorize SFOs to RWY 1/19 based on traffic density and
     controller training. From low approach or initial straight through an aircraft will make a
     climbing turnout to the west and report high key when over the desired touchdown point
     in order to execute a 360 deg turning SFO. If required to orbit at high key the aircraft
     will maintain a western orbit at high key altitude and report high key when over the
     desired touchdown point. When executing an SFO from high key, a 360 deg SFO to the
     west will be performed.
     4.36.4.3. RWY 30 OH SFO Procedures: From low approach or initial straight through
     an aircraft will make a left-hand climbing turnout to a 360 deg left turning SFO to the
     south. The pilot will report high key over the desired touchdown point. If required to
     orbit at high key, the aircraft will maintain a left-hand turn at high key altitude and report
     high key when over the desired touchdown point.
     4.36.4.4. Additional Information:
        4.36.4.4.1. High Key will normally be flown at 7,000 – 10,000 ft MSL.
        4.36.4.4.2. Low Key will normally be flown at 3,000 – 6,000 ft MSL.
        4.36.4.4.3. Airspeed will normally be 200 to 250 KIAS, but may vary due to weight
        and aircraft configuration. Pilots requiring a speed in excess of 250 KIAS will notify
        ATC prior to commencing the approach.
        4.36.4.4.4. Mandatory Reporting Points: High Key and Low Key (with gear and
        intentions).
        4.36.4.4.5. The OH SFO pattern will be flown in the same direction as the normal
        overhead pattern unless otherwise specified by tower.
        4.36.4.4.6. OH SFO Breakout Procedures. Prior to base key, tower shall state “(Call
        sign), REENTER, (Reason, time permitting, and follow-on instructions).” Aircraft
        shall climb to or maintain 500 ft above the overhead pattern altitude and comply with
        tower instructions. If no instructions are received, transmit intentions and request to
        tower.
        4.36.4.4.7. OH SFO Go-Around Procedures. Tower shall state “(Call sign), GO
        AROUND, (Reason, time permitting, and follow-on instructions).” If at or above
        2,100 ft MSL, maintain 2,100 ft MSL (500 ft above overhead pattern). If below
        2,100 ft MSL the aircraft will continue to descend to maintain at or below 1,000 ft
        MSL until departure end, and comply with tower instructions. If none are received,
        transmit intentions and requests to tower.
            4.36.4.4.7.1. For a pilot-initiated go-around or when a landing clearance is not
            received, the pilot shall report “(Call sign) BASE KEY, ON THE GO.” Execute
            the go-around procedure described above and follow tower instructions. If no
            instructions are received, the pilot shall transmit intentions and request to tower in
            the blind.
        4.36.4.4.8. If weather does not allow the execution of an SFO initiated from High
        Key, tower can authorize SFOs initiated from Low Key based on current weather
56                                                          EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013


        conditions and traffic density within the traffic pattern. The same ground track will
        be flown as described above, while remaining clear of clouds.
  4.36.5. SI SFO Pattern Descriptions and Procedures. (See Attachment 25)
     4.36.5.1. A SI SFO approach begins 8 NM from the runway and ends at the landing
     threshold.
     4.36.5.2. The 8 NM SI SFO point is straight out from the approach end of the runway at
     7,000 – 10,000 ft MSL.
     4.36.5.3. The 5 NM SI SFO point is straight out from the approach end of the runway at
     3,000 – 6,000 ft MSL.
     4.36.5.4. SI SFO airspeed will normally be 200 to 250 KIAS, but may vary due to weight
     and aircraft configuration. Pilots requiring a speed in excess of 250 KIAS will notify
     ATC prior to commencing the approach.
     4.36.5.5. If ERCF traffic permits, SI SFOs can expect descent to the requested altitude
     and vectors to the 8 NM reporting point. ERCF will coordinate with tower for SI SFO
     approval. Tower will deny the approach if more than three aircraft are projected to be in
     the VFR pattern when the SI SFO will arrive, or if a safety issue is involved.
     4.36.5.6. If tower approval is not received by 20 NM from the runway, expect descent to
     pattern altitude and sequencing with normal arriving traffic. If tower approval is received
     by the 20 NM point, expect a vector to a point 12-14 NM on final/dogleg, advise to
     proceed visually, and to contact tower. At this point, the IFR flight plan is deemed
     cancelled. Communications transfer to tower must occur prior to commencing the SI
     SFO maneuver. After contact with tower, and prior to 8 NM on final, expect verbal
     approval for the SI SFO from tower. If conditions develop which preclude the approach,
     expect to be sequenced by tower into the overhead pattern. If unable to communicate
     with tower, maintain assigned altitude and VFR, fly towards the runway and contact
     ERCF on last assigned ERCF frequency.
     4.36.5.7. Mandatory reporting points: Report: “(Call sign), 8-MILE SIMULATED
     FLAMEOUT FINAL” and “(Call sign), 5-MILE SIMULATED FLAMEOUT FINAL,
     GEAR, and intentions (e.g., touch and go, low approach)” to tower. Expect low approach
     clearance at 5 NM. If clearance is not received by 3 NM on final, proceed straight ahead,
     maintain 500 ft above the overhead pattern altitude, and expect an overhead approach.
     4.36.5.8. If tower does not have a visual or radar-indicated position of the aircraft by 5
     NM final, tower will discontinue the SI SFO approach and give directions to sequence
     the aircraft into the overhead pattern.
     4.36.5.9. Once the SI SFO aircraft is 8 NM final or closer, no arrival or departure aircraft
     will be permitted in front of the SI SFO aircraft.
     4.36.5.10. SI SFO Breakout/Go-Around Procedures.
        4.36.5.10.1. Prior to 5 NM final (6 DME), the tower shall state “(Call sign),
        TERMINATE THE SI SFO, (Reason, time permitting, and follow-on instructions).”
        If no instructions are received, climb to or maintain 500 ft above the overhead pattern
        altitude, and expect an overhead approach.
EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013                                                                     57


           4.36.5.10.2. Pilot initiated/tower directed go-around at or after 5 NM final. If at or
           above 2,100 ft MSL, maintain 2,100 ft MSL (500 ft above overhead pattern). If
           below 2,100 ft MSL the aircraft will continue to descend to maintain at or below
           1,000 ft MSL until departure end, and comply with tower instructions. If none are
           received, transmit intentions and requests to tower.
4.37. Rectangular Pattern.
   4.37.1. Fighter/Trainer Rectangular Pattern.
       4.37.1.1. RWY 1: Left Turns, 1,600 ft MSL.
       4.37.1.2. RWY 12: Left Turns, 1,600 ft MSL.
       4.37.1.3. RWY 19: Right Turns, 1,600 ft MSL.
       4.37.1.4. RWY 30: Left Turns, 1,600 ft MSL.
   4.37.2. Conventional Rectangular Pattern (See Attachment 20):
       4.37.2.1. RWY 1: Right Turns, 1,100 ft (600 ft Helicopters) MSL.
       4.37.2.2. RWY 12: Right Turns, 1,100 ft (600 ft Helicopters) MSL.
       4.37.2.3. RWY 19: Left Turns, 1,100 ft (600 ft Helicopters) MSL.
       4.37.2.4. RWY 30: Left Turns, 1,100 ft (600 ft Helicopters) MSL.
4.38. Noise Abatement Procedures. To minimize aircraft noise in the surrounding
communities, all pilots operating aircraft from EAFB or on Eglin ranges shall use the following
procedures consistent with aircraft configuration, MAJCOM directives, aircraft technical orders,
flight safety, and mission requirements:
   4.38.1. On all afterburner takeoffs, retard throttle out of afterburner as soon as safety
   permits, but not later than reaching 300 KIAS. Climb to 3,000 ft MSL at or below 350 KIAS
   using military thrust or less. Afterburner takeoffs between 2300L and 0600L shall be limited
   to RWY 12, 19, or 30.
   4.38.2. When departing RWY 1, climb runway heading until 3,000 ft MSL. Departure
   control should not allow turns over the town of Valparaiso/Niceville until at or above 3,000 ft
   MSL and north of the towns. Wingmen DO NOT use cutoff procedures to rejoin on the
   flight leader until above 3,000 ft MSL. Exception: If R-2918 is active a left turn of no more
   than 20 deg will be issued.
   4.38.3. Unless safety or mission requirements dictate otherwise, aircraft recovering from the
   east will fly a DDUNE recovery to avoid overflight of the towns of Valparaiso and Niceville.
   4.38.4. Recoveries from the West will utilize the Whiskey Hotel Recovery, whenever
   possible.
   4.38.5. Avoid populated areas on all low-level routes and plan departure/landing turns to
   minimize overflight of populated areas.
4.39. Areas of Potential Conflict. Outlined in the Mid-Air Collision Avoidance (MACA)
Program at http://flydts.com/resources/MACA-Pamphlet-Mar-07.pdf

4.40. Hurlburt Field Patterns.
4.40.1. Conventional Rectangular Pattern: Will normally be flown east of the runway.
However, patterns may be flown west of the runway for efficiency, if required for noise
abatement, or when operationally advantageous. RWY 18 pattern operations will be conducted
with left traffic. RWY 36 pattern operations will be conducted with right traffic. (See
Attachment 26) Traffic pattern altitudes and weather minimums are as follows:
       4.40.1.1. Helicopters: Flown at 700 ft MSL with 1,200 ft ceilings and/or 3 SM visibility
       required.
       4.40.1.2. Conventional Rectangular: Flown at 1,200 ft MSL with 1,700 ft ceilings and/or
       3 SM visibility required.
   4.40.2. Overhead Pattern. Will be flown on the west side of the runway for noise abatement;
   however, the east side may be used in the interest of safety and when operationally
   advantageous. (See Attachment 27) Flown at 1,700 ft MSL, with 2,200 ft ceilings and 3
   SM visibility required.
4.41. IFR Procedures. Aircraft at EAFB shall use the following go-around procedures unless
otherwise directed by ATC:
   4.41.1. Eglin Go-Around Procedures Inside the Final Approach Fix. ATC phraseology shall
   be as follows:
       4.41.1.1. RWY 1: “TOWER CLEARANCE CANCELLED/NOT RECEIVED, FLY
       RUNWAY HEADING, CROSS DEPARTURE END OF THE RUNWAY AT OR
       BELOW ONE THOUSAND FEET, CLIMB AND MAINTAIN THREE THOUSAND,

           HUNDRED, TURN LEFT HEADING TWO-ZERO-ZERO.”
4.42. Restricted Low Approach. IAW JO 7110.65 a low approach with an altitude restriction
of not less than 500 ft above the airport may be authorized except over an aircraft in takeoff
position or a departure aircraft. Tower personnel will determine the most appropriate altitude for
the traffic situation.
4.43. Aero Club Procedures.
   4.43.1. Normally, the Aero Club shall not use EAFB for practice approaches between
   0700L-1700L, Monday through Friday, except holidays unless all wing flying has terminated
   and practice approaches are approved by tower personnel.
   4.43.2. IFR and VFR cross-country flight plans shall be filed with AM Ops in person or via
   fax with approved LOA on file with Airfield Manager.
   4.43.3. Aero Club aircraft shall contact Eglin Clearance Delivery and state intentions to use
   either the North or East Training Areas prior to taxiing. Clearance Delivery will disapprove
   East Training Area requests if mission traffic is scheduled in R-2914A or R-2919A.
   4.43.4. Aero Club aircraft shall receive approval from Eglin Approach for flight in the
   North/South Corridor (“NORTH CORRIDOR FLIGHT APPROVED”). Eglin Approach
   shall advise aircraft if R-2918 is active for North Training Area flights. Aero Club aircraft
   operating within training areas are on a VFR flight plan shall remain VMC at all times,
   remain on the appropriate ERCF frequency, and advise prior to departing a training area.
   4.43.5. VFR Departures/Arrivals.

     4.43.5.1. Aircraft shall use RWY 1/19 to the maximum extent possible or as directed by
     ATC.
         4.43.5.1.1. RWY 1. Northbound departures shall turn eastward to clear the departure
         course, then proceed direct to Field 2 while eastbound aircraft shall proceed direct to
         White Point. Aircraft will climb to and maintain 1,100 ft MSL until arriving at Field
         2 or White Point unless approved otherwise by ATC. RWY 1 arrivals making other
         than a straight-in landing shall turn base leg south of King Hangar and north of the
         RWY 30 arrival course. If the pilot cannot meet this restriction, he/she shall notify
         the tower no later than midfield downwind. Simultaneous arrivals to RWY 1 and
         RWY 30 are not authorized.
         4.43.5.1.2. RWY 19 departures shall turn left, south of King Hangar and north of
         RWY 12. If the pilot cannot meet this restriction, they shall notify the tower prior to
         departure or immediately once airborne. Northbound aircraft shall proceed to Shirk’s
         Point direct to Field 2 while eastbound/westbound traffic shall proceed to Shirk’s
         Point direct to White Point. Aircraft will climb to and maintain 1,100 ft MSL until
         arriving at Field 2 or White Point unless approved otherwise by ATC.
         4.43.5.1.3. If the pilot desires a runway heading departure, he/she must request
         permission from the control tower prior to takeoff.
  4.43.6. VFR departures and arrivals direct to and from the Destin Airport are authorized with
  the following guidelines:
     4.43.6.1. Departures to Destin. The pilot shall request Destin departure through Eglin
     Tower prior to departure ("(Call sign) REQUEST DESTIN DEPARTURE").
         4.43.6.1.1. RWY 1: Turn right at the departure end of the runway direct White Point.
         The tower personnel shall issue traffic information and send the aircraft to Destin
         UNICOM no later than White Point.
         4.43.6.1.2. RWY 19: Turn left direct White Point remaining north of RWY 12
         departure course. The Tower shall issue traffic information and send the aircraft to
         Destin UNICOM no later than White Point.
     4.43.6.2. Arrivals from Destin. Aircraft operating at Destin will contact Eglin Tower to
     report intentions prior to entering Eglin traffic pattern. Specific instructions will be
     issued to enter the pattern at 1,100 ft MSL or as assigned by tower. (Example:
     “REPORT A 2-MILE FINAL FOR RWY 1”, or “REPORT A LEFT DOWNWIND VIA
     WHITE POINT FOR RWY 19”). If entering Eglin traffic pattern at a VFR reporting
     point, Eglin Tower may transfer control to ERCF.
  4.43.7. Normally, pattern altitude for Aero Club aircraft is 1,100 ft MSL. Aircraft will
  maintain 1,100 ft MSL within the Class D surface area when VFR unless ATC approves
  otherwise. They shall squawk the assigned Aero Club beacon code and altitude. A 600 ft
  MSL VFR traffic pattern for local Aero Club and other civil aircraft may be authorized in
  order to maintain 500 ft below clouds and depart under special VFR.
  4.43.8. Simultaneous operations are authorized between a RWY 12 arrival/departure and a
  locally assigned Aero Club arrival to RWY 19. Traffic information will be issued by the
  tower. Aero Club aircraft will complete the turnout as described in paragraph 4.43.5.1.1, or
EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013                                                                   61


   advise tower of intentions.     Simultaneous RWY 19 and RWY 12 departures are not
   authorized.
   4.43.9. Aero Club aircraft shall contact Eglin Ground Control on 121.8 after landing when
   clear of the runway, and when operating on the taxiways.
   4.43.10. VFR Holding Points and Procedures: Aircraft will circle over a VFR holding point
   when directed by the control tower or when communication with the control tower is not
   established.

   continues north to the south end of hangar 3057. This parking area is restricted to fixed wing
   aircraft with wingspans less than 110 ft. (Note: there is a contingency spot used for
   wingspans greater than 110 ft identified as “AM Ops Spot” that may be used with AM Ops
   coordination.) No transient aircraft will self park at Duke Airfield.
   5.5.3. Aerial Delivery Apron. The Aerial Delivery Apron has one parking spot (B13) that is
   jointly used for deployment aircraft (i.e. C-17, C-130, commercial) and for C-130 max power
   engine run-ups. During max power engine run-ups on spot B13, the aircraft’s owning unit
   will ensure that the service road behind the aircraft (north of parking spot) is closed to
   vehicle traffic.
   5.5.4. 413 FLTS Apron. The 413 FLTS apron is in front of hangar 3057, in between the
   Aerial Delivery Apron and the Transient Apron. It is designed for four helicopter spots, with
   two spots (B11 and B12) utilized as the primary locations for helicopter parking. Note:
   Spots B1 and B12 are available for CV-22 parking on a case by case basis. Spots A11 and
   A12 will only be used for contingency operations due to the proximity of the service road on
   the apron boundary. When helicopters are parked on spots A11 and A12, the service road
   will be closed to vehicle traffic. All contingency parking requires coordination and approval
   from the Airfield Manager.

   5.14.1. Duke’s Arresting System Standard Configuration.
      5.14.1.1. During normal operations, the BAK-12/Type H’s for RWY 18/36 will be in
      the lowered position.
      5.14.1.2. The departure end cable will be in the raised position and available when
      tailhook equipped aircraft are on approach or departing. Both cables will be available
      upon request.
   5.14.2. CE will report the status of cables to ATC/AM Ops using the following terminology,
   “in service” or “out of service” after all inspections, and/or maintenance.
   5.14.3. Aircraft Arresting Systems Maintenance.
      5.14.3.1. The Barrier Maintenance section of CE maintains arresting systems for Duke
      Field. Arresting systems will be thoroughly inspected by Barrier Maintenance personnel
      at least once daily before wing flying begins for that day. Additional inspections will be
      conducted throughout the day when deemed necessary by the Tower WS, AM Ops,
      and/or any SOF. Tower advises AM Ops if arresting system problems are reported or
      require any action. During duty hours, AM Ops will coordinate with CE Power
      Production for action. After duty hours, AM Ops will coordinate with the CE Fire
      Department for action.
      5.14.3.2. All barrier certifications will be pre-coordinated and approved by the Airfield
      Manager.
5.15. ATCALS. The following procedures will be adhered to any time CE Power Production
requires auxiliary generator checks or maintenance on any ATCALS/NAVAID or ATC facility
generator.
   5.15.1. During Duke Tower duty hours, before transferring to generator power for Duke
   Tower, CE Power Production must request approval from the Duke Tower WS/SC. Before
   transferring to generator power at any ATCALS/NAVAID facility, CE Power Production
   must request approval from 96 OSS/OSM, which in turn will coordinate with the appropriate
   ATC facility IAW 96 OSS OI 13-1. There are no auxiliary power generators for the
   localilizer or glideslope facilities. A battery backup system will provide short term power for
   approximately 30 minutes or until commercial power can be restored.
5.16. NOTAM Procedures.
   5.16.1. The NOTAM monitoring facility/dispatching facility for Duke Field is AM Ops.
   When Duke Field is closed Eglin AM Ops becomes the NOTAM monitoring
   facility/dispatching facility for Duke Field.
   5.16.2. The primary method for retrieving NOTAMs is through the Defense Internet
   NOTAM Service at https://www.notams.jcs.mil. NOTAMs can also be accessed at
   https://www.notams.faa.gov/dinsQueryWeb/. If both websites are unavailable, please
   contact the appropriate AM Ops for local NOTAMs. EAFB and Duke Field AM Ops will
   receive, transmit, post and document required NOTAM action IAW AFI 11-208_IP,
   (Department of Defense Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) System)
   5.16.3. All flying squadrons will obtain the required NOTAMs through the US NOTAM
   Web site or via an alternate web site. In the event the NOTAM web sites are not operational,
EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013                                                                    71


   contact destination airport via telephone to obtain the most current NOTAMs. Contact Duke
   AM Ops at (850) 883-6538 or via direct line to obtain the NOTAMs. Hurlburt Field AM
   Ops will disseminate or dispatch as required for Duke Field if the communication link to the
   Air Force Central NOTAM facility is locally inoperative.
5.17. Airfield Maintenance. All airfield maintenance will be coordinated through the Duke
Airfield Manager. All sweeper operations, grass mowing, and general maintenance operations
on the airfield environment will be coordinated and directed through the Duke Airfield Manager.
5.18. Airfield Tobacco Use Policy. There is no smoking on the airfield. Tobacco use is only
permitted in designated tobacco use areas. All smoking areas must be marked with signs stating,
“Designated Tobacco Use Area.” If an area is so identified, facility building managers will
ensure butt cans and receptacles are located in the designated outdoor area and away from
doorways, vestibules and within a safe distance from aircraft operations. The Air Force prohibits
tobacco use in Air Force vehicles for both civilian and military personnel.
5.19. Wear of Hats. Battle Dress Uniform (BDU)/Airman Battle Uniform (ABU)/Civilian hats
are authorized on the flight line at Duke Field except for: 1) Wear of any hat with metal

5.21. Scheduling and Flight Plan Procedures. IAW AFI 13-204V3, all aircraft departing Air
Force installations must have a flight plan on file (Stereo, VFR local,DD Form 175 or DD Form
1801) with AM Ops prior to departure. Flight plans must be filed in person unless there is an
approved LOA on file between the Airfield Manager and the user.
5.22. Movement Area. The aircraft movement area is defined as the runways, landing zones,
VTOL pads, taxiways, and other areas of the airport used for taxiing or hover taxiing, takeoff,
and landing of aircraft, excluding loading ramps and parking aprons.
5.23. Controlled Movement Area (CMA). Duke Tower is the controlling agency for all
ground traffic accessing the runway or either of the two VL pad controlled movement areas (VL
North CMA and VL South CMA). (See Attachment 5)
   5.23.1. Air Traffic Control Tower FM Nets (Ramp to Tower and Crash to Tower) are used
   solely for communications on the CMA. Tower shall continuously monitor these Nets during
   vehicle/personnel operations on the CMA. Vehicles/personnel operating on the CMA shall
   continuously monitor these Nets and may transmit as necessary to ensure the safety/care of
   personnel and/or equipment within the CMA. Tower may terminate unnecessary
   transmissions to reduce noise levels in the Control Tower when vehicles/personnel are no
   longer on the CMA, IAW AFI 13-204V3.
   5.23.2. No vehicle is authorized on, nor shall be approved to cross an active runway unless
   the vehicle is radio-equipped (or escorted by a radio-equipped vehicle) and in direct two-way
   contact with Duke Ground Control.
   5.23.3. Vehicle Recall Procedures when Radio Communications Fail. In the event radio
   contact is lost, vehicles/personnel will exit the runway and controlled movement area
   immediately. Light gun signals are not normally used by the control tower in Duke Field’s
   CMA. Duke Tower may indicate that radio contact has been lost by raising and lowering the
   intensity level of the runway lights or by flashing a red light in your direction.

5.24. Precision Approach Critical Area. When the ceiling is reported less than 800 ft or
visibility less than 2 SM, aircraft and vehicles shall not be allowed to operate within the ILS
critical area depicted in Attachment 4 unless approved and in radio contact with tower. Aircraft
and vehicles shall not transit the localizer critical areas or precede beyond the instrument/VFR
hold lines when an aircraft executing an ILS approach is inside the final approach fix. All
vehicles will request permission either by phone or radio from Duke Control Tower to cross the
south end perimeter road regardless of weather conditions.
5.25. Engine Test/Run-Up Areas and Procedures. IAW AFI 11-218 Aircraft Operations and
Movement on the Ground, aircraft are required to contact Ground Control prior to engine start.
All engine runs require approval/coordination with Duke AM Ops. The following are C-130
engine run spots with restrictions.
   5.25.1. Engine run spots B-6 and A-6 are unavailable due to the sunshade located on the
   washrack.
   5.25.2. Engine operation above ground idle but below 8,000 inch-pounds of torque (for C-
   130s only). Ensure no aircraft are parked in two spots directly behind and one spot directly
   in front of aircraft requiring engine operation. Engine operation above ground idle but below
   8,000 inch pounds of torque may be accomplished on spots A-1 through A-5, A-12, B-1
   through B-5 and B-13. The applicable Entry Control Point (ECP) will be closed to prevent
   access to the apron in front of or behind aircraft running on A-1 through A-4. The service
   road behind parking row 13 will be closed when engine runs are accomplished on A-13 or C-
   13. Engine runs on TWY A or D should be used as a last resort and approval must be
   obtained from the Duke Airfield Manager.
   5.25.3. Engine operation above 8,000 inch-pounds of torque up to max power. Ensure no
   aircraft are parked in two spots directly behind and one spot directly in front of aircraft
   requiring engine operation. Engine operations above 8,000 inch-pounds of torque up to max
   power may be accomplished on spots B-1 through B-4 provided they do not exceed 30
   minutes. Where it is determined that maintenance checks will exceed 30 minutes engine runs
   will be accomplished on spots A-13 or C-13. The service road behind parking row 13 will be
   closed when engine runs are accomplished on A-13 or C-13. Extended engine runs
   conducted anywhere else on the airfield must be coordinated through Airfield Management.
   5.25.4. Maximum power may only be applied to two symmetrical engines at the same time.
   The maximum power application on the apron shall not exceed a time limit of 10 minutes.
   5.25.5. Maximum reverse power may only be applied to two symmetrical engines at the
   same time. Maximum reverse power may be applied in short bursts only.
   5.25.6. In all cases the ground observer will continuously be on alert for any person, vehicle,
   or aircraft entering the danger zones directly behind or adjacent to the running aircraft. Pay
   particular attention to prop wake and its effect to taxing aircraft and vehicle movement.
   Notify run supervisor immediately and take appropriate actions.
EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013                                                                   73


5.26. Procedures for Suspending, Opening and/or Closing the Runway. The Duke Tower
WS/SC, Duke Airfield Manager or designated representative has authority to suspend runway
operations anytime there is an observed or reported hazardous condition or situation.
Appropriate NOTAMs will be sent for closures of the runway that exceed 30 minutes. Only AM
Ops has the authority to close or open the runway.
5.27. Airfield Inspections/Checks. These will be completed IAW requirements and procedures
outlined in AFI 13-204V3.

15 flying mile inbound call when requested for aeromedical aircraft arrivals.
5.30. Local Control Points. See EAFB procedures, Paragraph 4.31.
5.31. Taxi Procedures and Visual Blind Spots.
   5.31.1. Visual Blind Spots. Duke Tower is not responsible for ground traffic operating in
   those areas not visible from the tower. Visual blind spots for Duke Tower include TWY B
   west of TWY A and the area on the apron east of the sunshade.
   5.31.2. Taxi Procedures. Due to wing-tip clearance, no aircraft larger than a C-130 will taxi
   on Taxilane A when aircraft or equipment is parked on Bravo Row; larger aircraft can expect
   to back taxi on the runway.
5.32. Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS). See EAFB procedures, paragraph 4.33.
5.33. General Departure Procedures.
   5.33.1. Duke Field Standard Departure. IFR aircraft initially departing Duke Field shall
   maintain 2,000 ft MSL and be issued a departure heading by Duke Tower.
   5.33.2. VFR Overhead Pattern Protection. All departures from Duke Field shall maintain at
   or below 1,000 ft MSL until the departure end of the runway to protect the VFR overhead
   pattern, unless otherwise directed.
   5.33.3. AV-8 Operations.     VTOL/STOVL operations are not authorized due to asphalt
   runway and taxiways.
   5.33.4. Duke Field Intersection Departures (VFR and IFR). Intersection departures are
   authorized from all RWY 18/36 taxiway intersections. No intersection departures are
   authorized for the LZ. Duke Ground Control need not issue runway distance remaining to
   locally assigned aircraft aircraft making an intersection departure. The runway distances
   remaining from each of the taxiways at Duke Field are as depicted in Table 5.3.

   are expected to begin takeoff roll within 20 sec of clearance receipt. Tower shall advise the
   pilot in advance to "EXPECT IMMEDIATE DEPARTURE."
   5.33.6. Abbreviated Departure clearance. Duke Ground shall issue an abbreviated IFR
   clearance to all locally assigned aircraft with Duke stereo route flight plans. Example:
   “GOOSE71, DUKE GROUND, CLEARED TO DUKE FIELD AS FILED, <departure
   procedure>, <altitude data in order flown>, <frequency and beacon code information>.”
   5.33.7. Airborne pickup procedures.
      5.33.7.1. Upon initial contact with ground control, the pilot will advise ATC of intention
      to use an airborne pickup.
      5.33.7.2. When ready for takeoff, contact tower and include the airborne pickup request.
      Example: PILOT: "CUDA ONE, NUMBER ONE RUNWAY ONE EIGHT, REQUEST
      AIRBORNE PICKUP." TOWER: “CUDA ONE, RUNWAY ONE EIGHT LINE UP
      AND WAIT” or “CUDA ONE, AIRBORNE PICKUP APPROVED, MAKE (left/right)
      CLOSED, RUNWAY ONE EIGHT WIND CALM, CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF.”
      5.33.7.3. Airborne pickups including heavy aircraft, such as tankers, will be coordinated
      in advance with ATC. When cleared for takeoff, clearance for the airborne pickup and
      closed pattern direction will be issued by the tower.
      5.33.7.4. Both aircraft involved in this maneuver will remain on tower frequency until
      instructed to change to departure.
      5.33.7.5. The first aircraft to depart will execute a left/right turn (as directed by ATC) to
      inside downwind. The aircraft will configure as required/desired, execute a base turn
      (radio call to tower not required), and roll out offset from the runway left or right as
      necessary.
      5.33.7.6. The second aircraft will release brakes and the airborne aircraft will execute the
      join up. When both aircraft are at a safe altitude, tower will direct them to change to
      departure.
EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013                                                                     75


      5.33.7.7. ATC may have first airborne aircraft “report initial for airborne pickup/carry
      through” if conditions warrant. Additionally, the pilot may request “re-entry to initial for
      airborne pickup” if desired (subject to ATC approval).
      5.33.7.8. Restrictions.
          5.33.7.8.1. Weather minimums for executing the airborne pickup procedure shall be

          5.34.8.4.2. EGI RWY 18 VFR departures tower to tower to VPS proceed southwest-
          bound to JAIL at 1,600 ft MSL for Eglin Tower pattern entry.
5.35. Simulated Flameout Approaches (SFO). The OH SFO and the SI SFO simulated
flameout approaches will be conducted between the hours of sunrise to sunset and only during
periods of low density traffic (at the discretion of the Tower WS). To the maximum extent
possible, SFOs shall be requested prior to RTB due to the increased coordination required. In
addition, tower personnel may disapprove or cancel the procedure whenever they deem it
necessary for safety of flight. Approval of an SFO by the tower does not absolve the pilot from
the responsibility to comply with VFR see and avoid requirements. Participating aircraft are
considered to have canceled IFR upon communications transfer to tower. SFO airspace is
defined as a 4 NM radius from center of the airport from surface up to and including 10,000 ft
MSL unless otherwise coordinated.
   5.35.1. Weather and Runway Requirements. Official reported weather at the airport to
   which the approach is conducted will be ceiling at least 1,000 ft above the requested high or
   low key altitude and visibility of at least 5 SM.
   5.35.2. Duke Field is the primary choice for SFO training based on traffic pattern congestion
   at Eglin. Every attempt should be made to conduct SFO practice approaches to Duke Field.
   5.35.3. SI SFO primary location is Duke Field RWY 18.
   5.35.4. OH SFO Pattern Procedures. (See Attachment 23)
       5.35.4.1. RWY 18/36 OH SFO Procedures: From low approach or initial straight
       through an aircraft will make a climbing turnout to the west and report high key when
       over the desired touchdown point in order to execute a 360 deg turning SFO to the west.
       If required to orbit at high key the aircraft will maintain a western orbit at high key
       altitude and report high key when over the desired touchdown point.
       5.35.4.2. Additional information:
78                                                          EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013


        5.35.4.2.1. High Key will normally be flown at 7,000-10,000 ft MSL, other altitudes
        may be coordinated.
        5.35.4.2.2. Low Key will normally be flown at 3,000-6,000 ft MSL.
        5.35.4.2.3. Airspeed will normally be 200 to 250 KIAS, but may vary due to weight
        and aircraft configuration. Pilots requiring a speed in excess of 250 KIAS will notify
        ATC prior to commencing the approach.
        5.35.4.2.4. Mandatory reporting points: High Key and Low Key (with gear and
        intentions).
        5.35.4.2.5. The OH SFO pattern will be flown in the same direction as the normal
        overhead pattern unless specified by tower.
        5.35.4.2.6. OH SFO breakout procedures. Prior to base key, tower shall state “(Call
        sign), REENTER, (Reason, time permitting, and follow-on instructions).” Aircraft
        shall climb to or maintain 500 ft above the overhead pattern altitude and comply with
        tower instructions. If none are received, transmit intentions and request to tower.
        5.35.4.2.7. OH SFO Go-Around procedures. Tower shall state “(Call sign), GO
        AROUND, (Reason, time permitting, and follow-on instructions).” If at or above
        2,200 ft MSL, maintain 2,200 ft MSL (500 ft above overhead pattern). If below
        2,200 ft MSL the aircraft will continue to descend to maintain at or below 1,000 ft
        MSL until departure end, and comply with tower instructions. If none are received,
        transmit intentions and requests to tower.
            5.35.4.2.7.1. For a pilot-initiated go-around or when a landing clearance is not
            received, the pilot shall report “(Call sign) BASE KEY, ON THE GO.” Execute
            the go-around procedure described above and follow tower instructions. If no
            instructions are received, the pilot shall transmit intentions and request to tower in
            the blind.
        5.35.4.2.8. If weather does not allow the execution of an SFO initiated from High
        Key, Tower can authorize SFOs initiated from Low Key based on current weather
        conditions and aircraft workload within the traffic pattern. The same ground track
        will be flown as described above, while remaining clear of clouds.
  5.35.5. SI SFO Pattern Descriptions and Procedures. (See Attachment 25)
     5.35.5.1. A SI SFO approach begins 8 NM from the runway and ends at the landing
     threshold.
     5.35.5.2. The 8 NM SI SFO point is straight out from the approach end of the runway at
     8,000 ft MSL.
     5.35.5.3. The 5 NM SI SFO point is straight out from the approach end of the runway at
     4,000 to 6,000 ft MSL.
     5.35.5.4. SI SFO airspeed will normally be 200 to 250 KIAS, but may vary due to weight
     and aircraft configuration. Pilots requiring a speed in excess of 250 KIAS will notify
     ATC prior to commencing the approach.
EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013                                                                     79


      5.35.5.5. If ERCF traffic permits, SI SFOs can expect descent to 8,000 ft and vectors to
      the 8 NM reporting point. ERCF will coordinate with tower for SI SFO approval. Tower
      will deny the approach if more than three aircraft are projected to be in the VFR pattern
      when the SI SFO will arrive, or if a safety issue is involved.
      5.35.5.6. If tower approval is not received by 20 NM from the runway, expect descent to
      pattern altitude and sequencing with normal arriving traffic. If tower approval is received
      by the 20 NM point, expect a vector to a point 12-14 NM on final/dogleg, advise to
      proceed visually, and to contact tower. At this point, IFR flight plan cancellation is
      deemed to have occurred. Communications transfer to tower must occur prior to
      commencing the SI SFO maneuver. After contact with tower, and prior to 8 NM on final,
      expect verbal approval for the SI SFO from tower. If conditions develop which preclude
      the approach, expect to be sequenced by tower into the overhead pattern. If unable to
      communicate with tower, maintain 8,000 ft and VFR, fly towards the runway and contact
      ERCF on last assigned ERCF frequency.
      5.35.5.7. Mandatory reporting points: Report: “(Call sign), 8-MILE SIMULATED
      FLAMEOUT FINAL” and “(Call sign), 5-MILE SIMULATED FLAMEOUT FINAL,
      GEAR, and intentions (e.g., touch and go, low approach)” to tower. Expect low approach
      clearance at 5 NM. If clearance is not received by 3 NM on final, proceed straight ahead,
      maintain 500 ft above the overhead pattern altitude, and expect an overhead approach.
      5.35.5.8. If tower does not have a visual or radar-indicated position of the aircraft by 5
      NM final, tower will discontinue the SI SFO approach and give directions to sequence
      the aircraft into the overhead pattern.
      5.35.5.9. Once the SI SFO aircraft is 8 NM final or closer, no arrival or departure aircraft
      will be permitted in front of the SI SFO aircraft.
      5.35.5.10. SI SFO Breakout/Go-Around Procedures.
          5.35.5.10.1. Prior to 5 NM final (6 DME), the tower shall state “(Call sign),
          TERMINATE THE SI-SFO, (Reason, time permitting, and follow-on instructions).”
          If no instructions are received, climb to or maintain 500 ft above the overhead pattern
          altitude, and expect an overhead approach.
          5.35.5.10.2. Pilot initiated/tower directed go-around at or after 5 NM final. If at or
          above 2,200 ft MSL, maintain 2,200 ft MSL (500 ft above overhead pattern). If
          below 2,200 ft MSL the aircraft will continue to descend to maintain at or below
          1,000 ft MSL until departure end, and comply with tower instructions. If none are
          received, transmit intentions and requests to tower.
5.36. Helicopter/Tiltrotor Procedures.
   5.36.1. Helicopter Traffic Patterns. Helicopter Pattern altitude is 700 ft MSL with 45 deg
   entry legs to downwind. Traffic patterns shall be flown at or below 700 ft MSL unless
   otherwise approved by Duke Tower. (See Attachment 28)
      5.36.1.1. RWY 18: Right Traffic.
      5.36.1.2. RWY 36: Left Traffic.
 80                                                          EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013


   5.36.2. Helicopter East Transition Area. VFR training missions (including external cargo
   sling) are authorized in the southeast corner of the East Transition Area at Duke Field except
   during LZ operations, see Attachment 28. This area is bordered by the LZ on the west,
   TWY F-East on the north, the tree line on the east and south to the airport boundary. The
   area north of TWY F-East includes the engine test area and effluent spray field and is not
   included in the East Transition Area. Traffic patterns shall not be flown within 600 ft east of
   the LZ without authorization from ATC. Helicopter night landings may be made in the East
   Transition Area when portable lights are in place and illuminated. Portable lights shall not be
   used for Night Vision Imaging Systems (NVIS) training. Pilots shall advise the tower when
   conduction NVIS training.
       5.36.2.1. Helicopter pilots shall contact Duke Tower for clearance into or departure out
       of the East Transition Area. Pilots shall monitor tower frequency during all operations.
       This area shall not be authorized for more than four helicopters at any one time. Once in
       the area, pilots are responsible for maintaining their own separation from other
       helicopters, and clearances for successive approaches are not required. Use caution,
       vehicles in the East Transition Area are uncontrolled.
   5.36.3. Personnel and vehicle operators requiring access to the East Transition Area shall be
   briefed by Duke AM Ops to remain clear of the landing area.
   5.36.4. Autorotation.
       5.36.4.1. Helicopter test and practice autorotations shall only be conducted in the
       following areas with control tower approval:
           5.36.4.1.1. Duke Field, East Transition Area.
           5.36.4.1.2. Duke active runway.
       5.36.4.2. Designated autorotation landing areas shall be accessible to crash recovery
       crews on normal duty.
       5.36.4.3. Helicopter slide landings shall not be conducted on pavement areas unless
       approved by the Airfield Manager.
5.37. Duke Field Random Steep Approach. The Random Steep Approach is a VFR maneuver
that consists of a steep spiral descent, similar to an overhead approach, from higher than normal
traffic pattern altitudes directly over the airport. Aircraft will remain within a 4 NM radius of
Duke Field during descent. Approval for Random Steep Approach is at the discretion of the
Duke Tower WS after coordination with ERCF. Random Steep Approaches may be disapproved
or cancelled because of traffic or for other reasons, either before or after the start of the
maneuver. Approval of a Random Steep Approach does not relieve the pilot from the
responsibility to comply with VFR see and avoid requirements. Participating aircraft are
considered to have cancelled IFR upon communications transfer to Duke Tower.
   5.37.1. Weather Requirements. Official reported weather at Duke Field to conduct a
   Random Steep Approach will be:
       5.37.1.1. Ceiling: At least 500 ft above the requested inbound altitude.
       5.37.1.2. Visibility: Aircraft must remain VMC throughout maneuver.
       5.37.1.3. Runways or Landing Surfaces Available.
EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013                                                                    81


      5.37.1.4. Duke Field RWY 18/36 or LZ 18/36.
   5.37.2. Random Steep Approach Pattern Descriptions and Procedures. (See Attachment 30)
      5.37.2.1. ERCF will coordinate with Duke Tower for Random Steep Approach approval
      prior to the aircraft reaching 10 NM. Coordination will include call sign, type aircraft,
      aircraft location, requested altitude and inbound heading (180, 360, 270, or 090). ERCF
      will release Duke Field Random Steep Approach maneuvering airspace to Duke Tower.
      Communications transfer to Duke Tower must occur prior to 5 NM to descent point.
      Inbound altitude will vary based on pilot’s request (normally 4,500-10,000 ft MSL).
      Aircraft airspeed is normally 120-150 KIAS. Inbound heading is normally in line with
      runway in use. Other inbound headings may be requested. Approval will be based on
      traffic. Descent point is normally at the midfield point. At descent point, aircraft will
      report landing gear down and request landing clearance from Duke Tower. Based on
      aircraft altitude, aircraft may spiral in descent east and west of runway to land on runway
      in use. If conditions develop which preclude the completion of the approach, aircraft can
      expect to be sequenced by tower into either the overhead pattern or rectangular traffic
      pattern. Aircraft requesting Random Steep Approaches from the Duke rectangular VFR
      pattern or initial departure will normally be transferred to ERCF for climb to Random
      Steep Approach altitude unless ERCF releases Random Steep Approach maneuvering
      airspace to Duke Tower. Once Random Steep Approach maneuvering airspace is
      released to Duke Tower, ERCF will not allow other aircraft to transit the maneuvering
      airspace.
5.38. Duke Field Random Shallow Approach. Random Shallow Approach is a VFR
maneuver that consists of low-altitude/high-speed entry towards the runway from various
inbound headings.
   5.38.1. The Random Shallow Approach will be approved at the discretion of the Duke
   Tower WS. Random Shallow Approaches may be disapproved or canceled because of traffic
   or for other reasons, either before or after the start of the maneuver. Approval of a Random
   Shallow Approach does not relieve the pilot from the responsibility to comply with VFR see
   and avoid requirements and AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules, avoidance criteria.
   Participating aircraft are considered to have cancelled IFR upon communications transfer to
   Duke Tower.
   5.38.2. The three types of Random Shallow Approaches are as follows:
      5.38.2.1. 90 deg to the runway abeam. The aircraft flies the runway’s midfield point,
      then performs a 90 deg turn for a downwind entry to the runway in use.
      5.38.2.2. Straight-in to the active runway with a teardrop maneuver to land the opposite
      runway. Similar to a circling approach.
      5.38.2.3. Straight-in to the active runway. Aircraft performs a straight-in approach to the
      runway in use.
   5.38.3. Weather and Runway Requirements. Official reported weather at Duke Field to
   conduct a Random Shallow Approach will be:
      5.38.3.1. Ceiling: At least 500 ft above the rectangular pattern altitude.
      5.38.3.2. Visibility: Aircraft must remain VMC throughout maneuver.
 82                                                          EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013


       5.38.3.3. Runways or Landing Surfaces. Duke Field RWY 18/36, and LZ 18/36.
   5.38.4. Random Shallow Approach Pattern Descriptions and Procedures. (See Attachment
   31)
       5.38.4.1. ERCF will coordinate with Duke Tower for aircraft RTB Duke Field for
       Random Shallow Approach prior to 10 NM. Coordination will include call sign, type
       aircraft, aircraft location, and type of Random Shallow Pattern requested, abeam,
       teardrop, or straight-in. All approaches will be made to the runway in use unless
       previously coordinated. Aircraft in the Duke VFR pattern who request Random Shallow
       Approach from Duke Tower, will remain within a 4 NM radius of Duke Field, and in
       radio contact with Duke Tower at all times. East entries will be approved by ERCF on a
       case by case basis due to the proximity of Eglin’s RWY 19 final approach course.
       Communications transfer to Duke Tower must occur prior to entering Duke Field’s Class
       Delta airspace (5.2 NM radius of the geographical center of the Duke Field). Inbound
       altitude will be 1,200 ft MSL or higher. Once inside Duke Tower’s Class Delta airspace,
       aircraft may descend to 500 ft AGL (IAW AFI 11-202V3) to perform the maneuver.
       Aircraft will avoid over flying populated areas. Aircraft initial airspeed is normally 250
       KIAS. If conditions develop which preclude the completion of the approach, aircraft can
       expect to climb to 1,200 ft MSL and be sequenced by Duke Tower into rectangular traffic
       pattern.
5.39. Equipment Drop Zone (DZ) Use On Duke Field. (See Attachment 32) Currently the
old DZ is closed and will remain closed until the re-siting of the new area is completed and
approved. New Duke DZ procedures will be published accordingly.
5.40. Duke Field Night Vision Devices (NVD) Operations: Duke Field NVD operations apply
only to 919 SOW, 96 TW, and 1 SOW, and any units temporarily assigned under OPCON to
these units. The following procedures are IAW AFI 13-204V3.
   5.40.1. NVD Taxi Routes. NVD taxi routes are standard for the runway in use.
   5.40.2. NVD Vehicle Operations. NVD vehicle operations should be kept to a minimum
   during periods of reduced airfield lighting configurations. NVD vehicles will use hazard
   warning flashers or mount an I/R strobe on the vehicle’s roof. Vehicles will maintain two-
   way radio communication with the control tower while operating within the controlled
   movement area. Nonparticipating vehicles will not mix with NVD operations on any
   controlled movement area or taxiways.
   5.40.3. NVD Traffic Patterns. NVD traffic patterns are coincidental with the standard VFR
   traffic patterns for the runway in use and standard VFR pattern position reports are required.
   Request for NVD airfield light settings (AMP 3 or AMP 4) and appropriate step settings will
   be made on initial contact with Duke Tower and prior to turning base. The maximum
   number of aircraft simultaneously performing NVD operations is three. Duke Tower may
   reduce this number based on safety of flight. VFR straight-in approaches to RWY 36 will be
   approved based on traffic. Aircraft requesting 10 NM straight-in VFR finals for RWY 18
   will ensure the final approach course is at least 2 NM east of the Bob Sikes (CEW) airport.
   Altitude for VFR straight-in approaches is at or above 1,000 ft AGL. Aircraft may be
   switched to ERCF for flight following based on CEW traffic. Aircraft remaining with Duke
   Tower will monitor CEW CTAF on 122.95 when in the vicinity of CEW airport and maintain
EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013                                                                    83


   maximum vigilance for CEW traffic. At no time will aircrew proceed within 2 NM of the
   Bob Sikes Airport. All aircraft require tower approval to cross RWY 18 final approach
   course.
   5.40.4. Transition to Normal Lighting Configuration for Nonparticipating Aircraft.
   Nonparticipating aircraft will not mix with participating NVD aircraft in any traffic pattern,
   on any controlled movement area, or when taxiing. When transitioning to normal airfield
   lighting configuration for non-participating arriving aircraft, the airfield lights will be
   configured prior to the nonparticipating aircraft entering the Class Delta airspace. For
   nonparticipating departures, normal airfield lighting will be utilized prior to the
   nonparticipating aircraft taxi.
   5.40.5. Emergency Termination/Knock it Off Procedures. Duke Tower or aircrew may
   terminate NVD operations whenever safety of flight becomes an issue.
5.41. Duke Field Landing Zone (LZ) Operations: 919 OSS/OSO is the OPR for the use and
scheduling of Duke Field LZ. 919 SOW assigned units will coordinate use of Duke Field LZ
through established scheduling procedures IAW 711 SOS OI 90-02. A PPR number will not be
required for 919 SOW and 1 SOW assigned units. 1 SOW units will submit requests and
coordinate use of Duke LZ through 919 OSS/OSO. Units not assigned to 919 SOW or 1 SOW
will coordinate their request for the LZ and receive an LZ procedures briefing from the 919
OSS/OSO, DSN 875-6550 in order to obtain a PPR number for use of the LZ. The 919
OSS/OSO will provide Duke AM Ops with written confirmation that a procedures briefing has
been accomplished and Duke AM Ops will then issue a PPR to the requesting unit. All LZ
operations will be conducted when weather ceilings are reported as equal to or greater than 1,500
ft AGL and visibility equal to or greater than 3 SM.
5.42. Duke Field Forward Area Refueling Point (FARP).
   5.42.1. Duke Field has six certified FARP operations areas. All FARP operations at Duke
   Field will be conducted IAW the published FARP survey (AF Form 4066), the Duke Field
   FARP Memorandum of Agreement, and AFI 11-235. These documents are available upon
   request from the 96 OSS, 919 OSS Current Operations, or Duke Field Airfield Management.
   Simultaneous rearming and refueling operations are not authorized.
       5.42.1.1. FARP site One (1) is a fixed wing to fixed wing, located on TWY A at the
       northern end of the parking ramp and is a contingency site only.
       5.42.1.2. FARP site Two (2) is a fixed wing to fixed wing, located at the intersection of
       TWY D and the LZ.
       5.42.1.3. FARP site Three (3) and FARP site Four (4) are three point, fixed wing to
       rotary wing, and are located at the intersection of TWY D and TWY F on the east side of
       the LZ.
       5.42.1.4. FARP site Five (5) is a fixed wing to fixed wing, located at the intersection of
       TWY D and TWY F on the east side of the LZ.
       5.42.1.5. FARP site Six (6) is a two point, fixed wing to fixed wing, located at the
       intersection of TWY D and the LZ.
   5.42.2. IAW AFI 11-235 paragraph 4.8, Forward Air Refueling Point (FARP) Operations,
   during FARP operations there must be fire and crash coverage. Ensure vehicle and
84                                                           EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013


  equipment availability for largest aircraft using the site. Ensure fuel spill response capability
  to include HAZMAT response. A Crash/Fire/Rescue vehicle will be on scene prior to
  commencing FARP operations. The Crash/Fire/Rescue vehicle will be positioned in clear
  view of the FARP operation to monitor visual signals from FARP team members and if
  possible, maintain radio contact with the ST controller, tanker/receiver aircraft, or tower.
  5.42.3. LZ operations will be suspended whenever FARP sites 2 through 6 are active. This
  will facilitate tanker and receiving aircraft emergency egress procedures.
  5.42.4. Duke DZ operations will be suspended whenever FARP sites 2 through 6 are active.
  5.42.5. All VL North Pad operations will be suspended whenever FARP sites 2 through 6
  are active.
  5.42.6. The use of the east transition area will also be suspended whenever FARP sites 2
  through 6 are active.
  5.42.7. Taxiway A (between TWY B and TWY C) and parking rows 10 thru 13 will be
  closed during FARP operations on FARP site 1 (contingency use only). This will facilitate
  tanker and receiving aircraft emergency egress procedures.
EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013                                                                 85


                                          Chapter 6

                               EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

6.1. Daily Primary Crash Alarm System (PCAS) Phone Check. A quality assurance check
of the Eglin crash phone shall be performed daily, normally between 0700L and 0730L. The
quality assurance check of the Duke Field crash phone shall be performed prior to opening the
control tower.
6.2. Emergency Notification. In order to expedite the activation and movement of emergency
response agencies/vehicles, pilots shall declare an emergency with ATC as soon as possible
when a situation in the aircraft commander’s judgment warrants response from emergency
response agencies or when the aircraft has hung Category I (Cat I) or developmental ordnance.
6.3. Arrival/Departures. No aircraft shall be allowed to land on or takeoff from the same
runway after an inbound emergency aircraft is within 10 NM (fighter aircraft) or within 5 NM
(all other aircraft).
6.4. Eglin/Duke Field Discrete Emergency Frequency. The Eglin/Duke Field discrete
emergency frequency is local channel 9/269.15. The purpose of this discrete frequency is to
provide ATC, Eglin SOF, and Eglin/Duke Field Fire Department Crash or on-scene commander

                          RANGE EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

7.1. Inadvertent Release Procedures. (Uncommanded release of any store)
   7.1.1. If an inadvertent release occurs, switches shall be safed, and the pilot shall discontinue
   test area operations and prepare to RTB while following hung unsecured ordnance
   procedures for category of ordnance being carried.
   7.1.2. Switch positions, exact location, time of release, and circumstances of malfunction
   will be recorded by the pilot and provided to armament/safety personnel.
   7.1.3. Pilots will notify the RCO, Test Area Controller, and EMC of the location, type of
   munitions, and whether or not the munitions exploded, for any release that caused munitions
   to impact off the test area.
   7.1.4. Note: A multiple release of a practice bomb or rocket from a SUU-20 Bomb
   Dispenser when a signle release was intended is not considered an inadvertent release.
7.2. Unintentional Release Procedures. (Accidental release induced by aircrew)
   7.2.1. If an unintentional release occurs, note munitions impact point. For on-test-area
   impacts, pilots may elect to continue weapons delivery passes.
   7.2.2. For any release that causes munitions to impact off the test area, switches will be
   safed, no additional weapons delivery passes will be made, and record the information IAW
   paragraph 7.1.3.
7.3. Unexpended Ordnance Procedures.
   7.3.1. Any unexpended ordnance may be returned to EAFB without a safety chase. Pilots
   will avoid populated areas.
   7.3.2. Unexpended Cat I/II ordnance require a straight in to a full stop landing. If recovering
   from the North (ranges), attempt to land on RWY 12. If recovering from the south (water)
   attempt to land on RWY 30. RWY 1 can be used as a last resort if winds or other conditions
   do not allow landing on RWY 12/30. RWY 19 will only be used with 96 OG/CC approval.
       7.3.2.1. Exception: Aircraft with unexpended rail-launched (and for F-15s, fuselage-
       mounted AIM-120) missiles, Cat III, IV, V, and VI ordnance, chaff, and self-protection
       flares may make an overhead pattern to any runway including RWY 19.
7.4. Hung/Jammed/Unsafe Gun Procedures.
   7.4.1. In the event of hung/jammed/unsafe gun, pilots may return to EAFB without a safety
   chase. Aircraft with internal percussion activated ammunition and aircraft carrying pod-
   mounted percussion activated ammunition will orbit for 15 minutes to allow the gun to cool
   down prior to leaving the test area safety profile. Pilots will avoid populated areas.
7.4.2. The SOF will coordinate closing the appropriate roads with the tower.Eglin Control
Tower personnel will pass road closure request to AM Ops via the PCAS on the initial
emergency notification, which in-turn will alert the 96th Security Forces Squadron. The 96th
Security Forces Squadron will dispatch security forces to standby positions at Perimeter Road,
EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013                                                                        97


Eglin Boulevard, and/or Memorial Trail, as appropriate. The ERCF will notify tower personnel
when the emergency aircraft is 30 NM from the runway. Tower personnel will reactivate the
PCAS and request AM Ops to have security forces personnel close the roads. If the aircraft is
within 30 NM from the runway during the initial emergency notification, the request will be
made to close the roads on the initial PCAS activation. The roads must be closed prior to aircraft
landing and remain closed until directed to be opened by the on-scene commander responding to
the emergency.
       7.4.2.1. . Recovering from the south. Aircraft will attempt to land on RWY 30 in order
       to minimize overflight of civilian population and proceed to the Live Ordnance Loading
       Area (LOLA) via TWY E, park the aircraft on the last available spot in the front row
       (closest to revetment), and point the aircraft at the revetment. Perimeter Road must be
       closed to traffic crossing the departure end between TWY D and C. If the LOLA is not
       available, taxi to the revetted De-arm near taxiway F and park in the furthest open spot in
       front of the revetment. Aircraft landing RWY 1 will taxi to HG 1 and point towards the
       earthen berm.
       7.4.2.2. Recovering from the North. Aircraft will attempt to land on RWY 12 in order to
       minimize overflight of civilian population and proceed to the LOLA via TWY F, park the
       aircraft on the last available spot in the front row (closest to the revetment), and point the
       aircraft at the revetment. Eglin Boulevard between the control tower and Memorial Trail
       must be closed. Memorial Trail must also be closed to traffic crossing the departure end
       between Eglin Boulevard and the horse stables. If the LOLA is not available, taxi to the
       revetted De-arm near taxiway F and park in the furthest open spot in front of the
       revetment.
       7.4.2.3. Once in the LOLA, the aircraft will be chocked and all other munitions safed (if
       applicable) before proceeding with gun safe operations. All personnel and equipment
       must be kept from passing in front of the muzzle-end of the gun until it is properly safed.
       If the gun can be properly safed and clear of live rounds, the aircraft may taxi back to the
       appropriate parking spot. If the gun cannot be properly secured safe, rounds cannot be
       cleared from the gun, or a hazardous condition exists, then the aircraft will be shut down
       and grounded before proceeding with gun clearing procedures. Also see EAFBI 21-102,
       Flightline Explosives Operations.
   7.4.3. Hung/Jammed/Unsafe Gun Recovery Procedures (Side-Door Firing).
       7.4.3.1. For aircraft with side-door firing guns unable to recover at Hurlburt Field, Duke
       Field is the primary option for hung gun recoveries. The following procedures will be
       applied to any side-door gun aircraft landing at Duke Field with hung/unsafe guns. Note:
       The following directions assume guns are pointing out of the left side of the aircraft
       (orientation of AC-130). If guns are oriented another direction, care should be taken by
       the aircraft operator and response agencies to ensure that the hung gun faces north, east,
       or south to the greatest extent possible during landing and taxi, and that the aircraft is
       parked with the gun facing east.
           7.4.3.1.1. Aircraft landing RWY 36 will rollout to the end of the runway, perform a
           180 degree turn in order to keep the gun pointing north and east. Back taxi down the
           runway, turn left onto TWY E-East. After crossing the LZ, continue onto VL SOUTH
 98                                                           EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013


          pad, turning the nose of aircraft south (90 degree right turn), ensuring gun is facing
          east.
          7.4.3.1.2. Aircraft landing RWY 18 will rollout to the end of runway, turn left onto
          TWY E-East. After crossing the LZ, continue onto VL SOUTH pad, turning the nose
          of aircraft south (90 degree right turn), ensuring gun is facing east.
          7.4.3.1.3. In event of simultaneous jammed/unsafe gun recoveries, the first aircraft
          landing will follow the procedures described in paragraphs 7.4.3.1.1-3. If landing
          RWY 18, the second aircraft will remain on the runway and stop south of the south
          BAK-12, at the Box 1 line across the runway (next to grounding point on the east side
          of the runway). If landing RWY 36, the second aircraft will execute a 180 degree
          turn at the end of the runway and proceed south to the Box 1 line.
          7.4.3.1.4. The VL SOUTH pad, Duke Field drop zone, east transition area, and the
          LZ will be temporarily closed or suspended until the Airfield Manager or designated
          representative reopens them.
7.5. Jettison Procedures.
   7.5.1. Normally, jettison should be accomplished below 5,000 ft MSL over land areas
   (preferably B-71) or below 10,000 ft MSL over water areas. AC-130s should use the
   guidance from HFI 11-201. For emergencies immediately after takeoff that necessitate
   jettisoning, the emergency jettison areas shown in Attachment 33 will be used if at all
   possible.
   7.5.2. The pilot is responsible for both surface and air clearance on any TW test area. When
   the water test areas are used, the designated Salvo Area is a 10 NM wide corridor along the
   western edge of W-151 beginning at a point 30 NM south of Santa Rosa Island (DWG
   190/054) to 63 NM due south of Santa Rosa Island along the 86° 49’W longitude line.
   7.5.3. During land test missions, ordnance will be jettisoned according to instructions from
   the Test Area Controller. If any doubt exists about the safety of jettisoning armed ordnance
   on a land test area, the pilot may elect to jettison safe. During over water test missions,
   ordnance will be jettisoned armed after visually clearing the impact area.
   7.5.4. In the event an emergency precludes the use of the Salvo Area, the flight may drop
   ordnance on any test area. Pilots are required to clear areas visually prior to release of
   ordnance and will notify EMC, if possible, prior to drop. Ordnance will be dropped in the
   minimum safe release interval. Caution must be exercised when dropping ordnance in an
   armed configuration. The area cleared must exceed the prescribed ground safe distance of
   the ordnance, and the release altitude must exceed the minimum safe altitude prescribed for
   the particular munitions.
   7.5.5. If the primary aircraft experiences radio failure, the chase aircraft must coordinate the
   jettison with EMC or other appropriate agency. The primary aircraft will release on visual
   signals initiated by the chase. These visual signals and procedures for radio failure must be
   thoroughly covered in the mission briefing.
EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013                                                                    99


7.6. Hung Ordnance General Procedures. Hung ordnance procedures only apply to Cat I
through IV ordnance.
   7.6.1. The mission briefing for all ordnance delivery will include specific hung ordnance
   procedures, to include recovery routes. The applicable hung ordnance recovery procedure
   will be followed unless a modified procedure has been approved in writing for the specific
   ordnance by the 96 TW Airborne Test Review/Safety Board (ATR/SB), 53d Wing Project
   Safety Review Board, or 33 OG/CC for their respective projects. Any modification will be
   approved by the 96 OG/CC before use.
   7.6.2. After reselecting the affected station and checking weapons release procedures,
   additional attempts to release the hung ordnance are authorized within the bounds of the
   applicable TD. The aircraft should remain within the approved profile not to exceed the
   reservation boundaries.
   7.6.3. Further normal release attempts of ordnance aboard other aircraft stations are not
   authorized. Exception: When an aircraft is configured with training ordnance on more than
   one station, the pilot may continue release attempts as long as the aircraft can remain within
   the range boundary.
   7.6.4. Pilots will attempt to jettison all hung unsecured ordnance IAW Paragraph 7.5 before
   landing unless a written waiver has been approved by appropriate agency in Paragraph
   7.6.1.
   7.6.5. Aircraft with hung Cat I munitions and hung, unsecured Cat II through IV munitions,
   will declare an emergency. Hung secure rockets do not required declaration of emergency.
   Further requirements for declaration of emergency will be at the pilot’s discretion.
7.7. Hung/Unexpended Ordnance Notification Procedures.
   7.7.1. Pilots with unexpended Cat I/II/III munitions shall notify EMC IAW Table 7.1 as an
   advisory to Crash Rescue. Unexpended Cat IV/V/VI munitions do not require any ordnance
   notification procedures.
   7.7.2. The pilot will notify the Eglin SOF and EMC as soon as possible to coordinate
   recovery for Hung Ordnance. As a minimum, the Eglin SOF and EMC must know the
   weapon category, type and number, status (secure/unsecure), time of attempted release, and
   intentions (i.e., landing runway and type approach, and special requests to stop traffic on
   Eglin Boulevard/Perimeter Road, runway inspection after landing if required). For
   Unexpended Ordnance, pilots will contact EMC 5 minutes prior to departing the test area.
      7.7.2.1. The Eglin SOF will coordinate closing the appropriate roads with the tower.
      Eglin Control Tower personnel will pass road closure requests to AM Ops via the PCAS
      on the initial emergency notification, which in-turn will alert the 96th Security Forces
      Squadron. The 96th Security Forces Squadron will dispatch security forces personnel to
      standby positions at Perimeter Road, Eglin Boulevard or Memorial Trail, as appropriate.
      Eglin Radar Approach Control will notify tower when the emergency aircraft is 30 NM
      from landing. Tower personnel will reactivate the PCAS and request AM Ops to have
      security forces close the roads. If the aircraft is within 30 NM during initial emergency
      notification, the request will be made to close the roads on the initial PCAS activation.
 100                                                            EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013


       The roads must be closed prior to aircraft landing and remain closed until directed to be
       opened by the emergency on-scene commander.
   7.7.3. EMC shall:
       7.7.3.1. Make sure aircraft and Eglin Approach are provided a route clear of active test
       areas from the point of hand-off to the point where the aircraft will exit the
       restricted/warning areas.
       7.7.3.2. Advise Eglin Approach Control of the following:
          7.7.3.2.1. Identification and type of aircraft.
          7.7.3.2.2. Hung or unexpended ordnance.
          7.7.3.2.3. Landing runway and type approach requested.
       7.7.3.3. Advise tower of the following:
          7.7.3.3.1. Identification and type of aircraft.
          7.7.3.3.2. Hung or unexpended ordnance status (including category and number).
          7.7.3.3.3. Landing runway (per pilot’s request).
          7.7.3.3.4. Additional pilot requests.
       7.7.3.4. Notify JTTOCC and request personnel for de-arming. The JTTOCC will notify
       the appropriate MOCC.
   7.7.4. Eglin Approach Control shall:
       7.7.4.1. Provide EMC with an altitude for exit from the test areas.
       7.7.4.2. Provide aircraft with vectors and directions that shall avoid overflight of
       populated areas.

7.8. Hung Ordnance Recovery Procedures.
   7.8.1. All aircraft with secure or unsecure hung ordnance will return to EAFB.
   7.8.2. If ordnance is not jettisoned, aircraft with hung, secure LUUs will land at EAFB. For
   hung LUU-flares with a fire, first jettison the SUU dispenser and then land at EAFB.
   7.8.3. For hung Target Practice (TP) and White Phosphorus (WP) rockets, if the rockets can
   be confirmed secure, then the aircraft will return to EAFB, declaration of emergency is not
   required and is at the discretion of the pilot. Fly a straight-in to RWY 12 or RWY 30. Taxi
   to the normal de-arm area at TWY G/D. If the rocket/pod can be safed, the aircraft will then
   be allowed to taxi to the LOLA, hot gun line or chocks for download as directed by de-arm
   crews. If it cannot be safed, the aircraft will be shut down and turned over to Explosive
   Ordnance Disposal (EOD) personnel for safing and disposition. Individual hung rocket
   procedures for high-explosive (HE) munitions will be developed IAW paragraph 7.6.1. For
   hung unsecured rockets, the pilot shall attempt to jettison the pod (rocket fire) prior to
   landing. If unsuccessful, the pilot may land at EAFB with a hung unsecured rocket IAW
   hung Cat I procedures.
   7.8.4. Hung LUU-Series Flare Procedures. For both secure and unsecure, hung LUUs, land
   at EAFB IAW hung Cat I procedures. For hung LUU-flares with a fire, jettison the SUU
   dispenser then land at EAFB. For hung, unsecure LUUs without a fire, retain the pod then
   land at EAFB.
   7.8.5. For hung Cat I (except fuselage and rail-launched missiles) and all unsecure ordnance,
   pilots will attempt to get a safety chase to help determine ordnance/aircraft status and provide
   assistance during recovery.
   7.8.6. A straight-in approach will be flown avoiding populated areas.
      7.8.6.1. For all hung unsecure munitions stop straight ahead on the runway. After being
      de-armed on the runway, follow de-arm crew direction as to whether to taxi to LOLA for
      download or chocks.
   7.8.7. Recovering from the North. Fly an approach to RWY 12 to minimize over flight of
   civilian population.
      7.8.7.1. RWY 12 CAT I/II munitions. Attempt to exit the runway at taxiway F. Park in
      the LOLA in the last spot in the row closest to the revetment. If unable to land on RWY
      12 due to winds or other conditions, avoid all populated areas and land on RWY 30 and
      follow the procedures in paragraph 7.8.8.
      7.8.7.2. For RWY 12 with CAT I munitions Eglin Boulevard, between the control tower
      and Memorial Trail, must be closed. This is due to 1,250 ft safety zones. TWY H
      between TWY F and RWY 1/19 will also be closed. For Cat I, Memorial Trail must also
      be closed to traffic crossing the departure end between Eglin Boulevard and the horse
      stables. Recovery of Categories II through IV munitions does not require the closure of
      Eglin Boulevard.
   7.8.8. Recovering from the South. Fly an approach to RWY 30 to minimize over flight of
   civilian population.
 102                                                         EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013


       7.8.8.1. RWY 30 CAT I/II munitions. Attempt to exit the runway at taxiway E, Park in
       the LOLA in the last spot in the row closest to the revetment. If unable to land on RWY
       30 due to winds or other conditions, avoid all populated areas and land on RWY 12 and
       follow the procedures in paragraph 7.8.7
       7.8.8.2. For RWY 30 with Cat I munitions, due to safety zones, TWY B and H between
       TWY D and E will be closed. Perimeter Road must also be closed to traffic crossing the
       departure end between TWY C and D. Recovery of aircraft on RWY 30 does not require
       the closure of Eglin Boulevard.
   7.8.9. For aircraft recovering with hung secure Categories III/IV munitions, taxi to normal
   de-arm areas at TWY G or TWY D. Following de-arm, the de-arm crews will direct
   shutdown at de-arm or taxi back to chocks. Recovery of aircraft with Categories II through
   IV munitions does not require closure of any roads.
   7.8.10. In the event RWY 1 is used for landing, Hot Gun line #1 will be used in place of the
   LOLA when previously required (i.e., CAT I/II hung ordnance). Attempt to exit RWY 1 at
   taxiway P and park facing the berm.
   7.8.11. For unique munitions requiring special handling (i.e., thermal batteries), follow
   ground procedures approved during the 96 TW ATR/SB, 53 WG Safety Review Board, or by
   the 33 OG/CC. All procedures must be approved by the 96 OG/CC.
   7.8.12. Duke Field: For any situation that would require a hung ordnance recovery to Duke
   Field, fly an approach to RWY 18. Turn left at TWY E. Taxi to the intersection of TWY E
   and the LZ, hold short of the LZ and point the aircraft Eastbound.
       7.8.12.1. If unable to land on RWY 18, fly an approach to RWY 36. After coming to a
       stop, execute a right turn and back-taxi to turn off at TWY E. Taxi to the intersection of
       TWY E and the LZ, hold short of the LZ and point the aircraft Eastbound.
       7.8.12.2. Fire department will have weapons attempt to immediately safe the weapon. If
       the weapon is breached or unsecure, EOD teams will determine the weapon status. After
       munitions are safed the aircraft may depart for original destination. If further parking is
       required aircraft will remain at same location.
7.9. IFR Hung/Unexpended Ordnance Recovery Routes.
   7.9.1. EAFB. Expect radar vectors to avoid populated areas to the maximum extent
   possible. Expect clearance for standard recoveries: RWY 1/30, Eglin North Recovery, and
   RWY 12/19, DDUNE Recovery. If weather is IFR, expect applicable instrument approach.
   The pilot will request to land on the runway most appropriate for the situation, i.e., ordnance
   carried, weather.
   7.9.2. Duke Field: Expect radar vectors to avoid populated areas to the maximum extent
   possible. In IFR conditions, expect to land via ILS to RWY 18 to avoid overflight of EAFB
   and populated areas.
   7.9.3. Hurlburt Field: Approaches shall be under radar control except during lost
   communications conditions. Make every effort to avoid populated areas as soon as visual
   contact with the runway environment is made.
EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013                                                                      103


7.10. De-Arming Procedures.
   7.10.1. All 96 TW and 53 WG aircraft will proceed through de-arm immediately after
   landing, regardless of munitions carried in order to have safety pins/devices installed prior to
   taxiing back to parking. Aircrew will verify all armament switches are OFF/SAFE and hold
   hands in view of armament personnel during de-arming operations.
   7.10.2. Aircraft with forward firing ordnance should taxi so as to eliminate or minimize the
   time the aircraft is pointed toward an inhabited area. Minimize pointing forward firing
   ordnance toward inhabited areas by continuing to the end of the runway before turning
   toward the de-arm area.
   7.10.3. Host and associate organizations will ensure the appropriate arm/de-arm areas are
   manned by arm/de-arm crews during launch and recovery of unit aircraft regardless of
   munitions carried.
   7.10.4. Arm/de-arm crews will check all unexpended ordnance as soon as the aircraft is
   parked at the arm/de-arm area and make sure munitions are still loaded/installed properly.
   7.10.5. Weapons personnel will inspect aircraft with hung ordnance and determine if the
   aircraft can proceed to the parking area, or if it must be shut down. If the aircraft must
   proceed to the hot gun area, aircrew should exit the de-arm area in a direction that minimizes
   pointing forward firing ordnance at inhabited areas. Aircrew taxiing back to the Hot Gun
   Line #1 will request to taxi down RWY 1, exiting at TWY P. If the aircraft must be shut
   down, Weapons personnel will safe the hung ordnance and have the arm/de-arm crew pin all
   remaining munitions. EOD personnel will take other necessary emergency actions as
   required.
   7.10.6. De-arm crew (composed of weapons personnel) will notify the pilot of action taken
   to safe hung/unexpended ordnance. A headset for aircraft interphone is required..
   7.10.7. When any aircraft not requiring use of the de-arm area (e.g., C-130) exits the
   runway, aircrew should verify status of chaff/flare system. If any hung chaff/flare condition
   exists, aircraft will follow Tower instructions for a safe parking area to avoid conflict with
   other aircraft movement on the ground until the system can be made safe to continue taxi to
   park or the aircraft will be shutdown in position.
   7.10.8. After receiving permission from the tower to enter the runway, AM Ops and/or EOD
   personnel shall make a runway inspection following the landing of an aircraft carrying
   loaded CBU type munitions dispensers (downward or rearward dispensing) with
   submunitions aboard. When this need exists, as identified during a RMB or ATR/SB, EOD
   will advise the tower of this requirement.
7.11. Radio Failure Procedures with Ordnance.
   7.11.1. If one member of a flight has radio failure, that member will make a dry pass in
   normal sequence by the tower, rock the wings to indicate a radio failure, pull off in the
   direction of traffic, and establish an orbit 2,000 ft above the highest pattern remaining to be
   flown, and await join up. If single ship, the pilot will accomplish the same procedure with
   the exception of departing the test area after pulling off in the direction of traffic. The pilot
   will squawk Code 7600. The Test Area Controller/RCO will notify EMC who will notify
   Eglin Approach Control.
 104                                                        EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013


   7.11.2. If a pilot has radio failure with an emergency or with hung ordnance, the pilot will
   make a dry pass (circumstances permitting), rock the wings, and break opposite the pattern
   direction. Squawk Code 7700. The Test Area Controller/RCO will notify EMC who will
   notify Eglin Tower.
   7.11.3. If the Test Area Controller/RCO loses radios, the aircraft will remain at pattern
   altitude and attempt contact on alternate frequencies. Notify the JTTOCC if no contact. No
   ordnance will be dropped without radio contact with the appropriate test area control/RCO
   authority.
   7.11.4. Other unit/command procedures for radio failure will be followed if they are more
   restrictive.
   7.11.5. The JTTOCC will monitor Test Area Control Common (Wolf Call) frequencies
   276.0/165.1875 to approve test area operation/ordnance delivery on unmanned test areas, and
   to act as a backup point of contact for manned test areas.
7.12. Helicopter and AC-130 Gunship Weapon Systems Malfunction.
   7.12.1. The aircraft commander will be notified of any weapon system malfunction.
   7.12.2. The aircraft will maintain an orbit over assigned test area until the weapons can be
   placed in a safe condition.
   7.12.3. If system cannot be safed, or a hung flare condition exists, an emergency should be
   declared. On recovery, populated areas should not be overflown. Gun systems should not be
   directed at populated areas. AC-130s use guidance IAW HFI 11-201 for specific jettison
   procedures in the Eglin ranges.
7.13. Crash Procedures. If a known or suspected crash occurs on or near the test area, the
following actions will be taken by the RCO:
   7.13.1. Close the test area.
   7.13.2. Request a specific flight member to notify Eglin Tower on guard channel.
   7.13.3. Call Eglin AM Ops at (850) 882-5313 and provide all known information, including
   crash site location, caller's name, and phone number.
   7.13.4. Notify the Eglin Command Post at (850) 883-4020 with the same information.
   7.13.5. Clear all aircraft from the test area.
   7.13.6. Remain in the control tower to coordinate rescue action and provide information.
7.14. RCO Procedures during Emergencies.
   7.14.1. In-Flight Emergency/Hung Ordnance. The RCO will notify the Eglin Command
   Post as soon as possible when an aircraft has a problem necessitating special recovery
   procedures.
   7.14.2. Communication Failure. In the event of radio failure, the RCO will:
       7.14.2.1. Attempt contact on the field radio, secondary test area frequency, or EMC
       frequency.
EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013                                                                      105


     7.14.2.2. If it is necessary to abort a pass by a delivery aircraft, fire one flare from the
     control tower.
     7.14.2.3. If it is necessary to close the test area, fire two flares from the control tower.
     7.14.2.4. Notify EMC by landline of test area radio problems or failure.
     7.14.2.5. Notify EMC immediately when an aircraft departs the test area with apparent
     radio failure or an emergency.
 106                                                          EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013


                                           Chapter 8

            TEST MISSION DEPARTURE AND RECOVERY PROCEDURES

8.1. Test Area Scheduling.
   8.1.1. Test area airspace will be scheduled according to EAFBI 13-204, Mission Scheduling
   and Control. This instruction also contains procedures for scheduling “shared airspace,”
   which enables a lower priority mission to be scheduled with a higher priority mission by
   deconfliction of mission profiles, which allows for maximum use of test area airspace.
8.2. Test Area Control Call Signs. All test area operations must have clearance and two-way
radio communication with the appropriate test area RCO before and during ordnance release or
launching operations. Call signs for appropriate test area control authorities are listed in Table
8.1.
   8.2.1. Warning Area/Water Missions. The aircrew is responsible for ensuring that they meet
   all safety criteria and procedures to include those stipulated in the Safety Appendix issued for
   the particular test/mission being conducted before going hot over water within W-151. The
   aircraft commander is designated as the safety observer for all hot missions while in W-151.
   For those missions using the Central Control Facility (CCF), call sign CHAMBER, as
   mission control, approval from CHAMBER is also required before going hot.
   8.2.2. For manned test areas, the Test Area Controller is the appropriate authority for
   approval of test area operations and the RCO is the appropriate authority for expenditure of
   ordnance on the test area.
       8.2.2.1. Test Area Controllers performing RCO duties must meet the criteria and
       qualifications IAW AFI 13-212.
   8.2.3. For unmanned test areas, the JTTOCC (Call sign “Wolf Call”) is the appropriate test
   area control authority. The JTTOCC monitors frequencies 276.0/165.1875 to approve test
   area operation/ordnance delivery on unmanned test area, and as a backup point of contact for
   manned test areas. Note: Aircrew will check in, obtain clearance, and check out with the
   JTTOCC, but will monitor their assigned mission frequency when working the unmanned
   test area.
   8.2.4. The RCO is responsible for the conduct and safety of ordnance delivery missions after
   obtaining assurance from the Test Area Controller that the gates are closed and the test area
   is clear of all personnel.
EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013                                                                   107

                 B-71         B-75 Control
                 Note: General test area status information for other test areas
                 not listed can be received by contacting the JTTOCC ((850)
                 882-5800).

8.3. Test Area Operations Responsibilities.
   8.3.1. The JTTOCC will:
       8.3.1.1. Coordinate daily test area air and ground operations and deconflict mission
       profiles by terminating/canceling the mission with the lower priority when prevailing
       conditions preclude the completion of all scheduled activity.
       8.3.1.2. Advise EMC of those missions that have been terminated or canceled.
       8.3.1.3. Provide test area control for unmanned test areas and act as a back-up point of
       contact for manned test areas.
   8.3.2. Aircrew will:
       8.3.2.1. Remain within their assigned airspace/profile.
       8.3.2.2. Advise EMC 5 minutes prior to RTB.
   8.3.3. EMC will:
       8.3.3.1. Monitor all restricted and warning area activity and issue traffic advisories for
       present and/or pending traffic within adjacent test areas.
       8.3.3.2. Advise when changes to the status of adjacent test areas occur. Note: EMC is
       not an appropriate test area control agency for approval of the application/delivery of
       ordnance or laser firing.
 108                                                         EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013


       8.3.3.3. Place aircraft in a "safety hold" when the aircraft is unable to remain within its
       approved profile and the safety of other aircraft is in jeopardy, until the problem is
       resolved or the aircraft returns to base.
       8.3.3.4. Advise the JTTOCC when aircraft are placed in or removed from a "safety
       hold," or prevailing conditions, such as overlapping profiles, etc., preclude the
       completion of mission activity.
       8.3.3.5. Route profile deviations reported by Eglin Mission through the ERCF Chief
       Controller to 96 OSS/OSAA, Chief, Airspace Management and Mission Planning
       (CAMMP). The CAMMP will initiate the 96 TW Form 115, Profile Deviation Report,
       and submit it to 96 OSS/OSXA, Airspace Manager. Reports shall be completed within
       30 days of initial notification of the deviation and submitted to 96 OG/CC for final
       disposition. Copies of the completed 96 TW Form 115 shall also be forwarded to 96
       OSS/CC and 96 TW Flight Safety (96 TW/SEOF). Final reports shall be retained by 96
       OSS/OSXA.
   8.3.4. Test Engineers/Project Officers. Test engineers or project officers will brief aircrew
   on conflicting or shared airspace missions.
8.4. Departure Procedures.
   8.4.1. Arm/De-arm Areas. EAFB's arm/de-arm areas are depicted in Attachment 2. The
   de-arm area for Duke Field is an 800 ft circle centered on TWY E. All de-arm areas are also
   designated hung ordnance areas.
   8.4.2. Start, Taxi, and Arming.
       8.4.2.1. The pilot will make sure all armament switches are OFF/SAFE prior to electrical
       power being applied to the aircraft.
       8.4.2.2. Aircrew will make sure all armament switches are OFF/SAFE and hold their
       hands in view of armament personnel during arming operations.
       8.4.2.3. All aircraft loaded with experimental or uncertified forward firing munitions and
       parked on the hot gun ramp will be armed for a system safety check then de-armed prior
       to taxi. Aircraft parked on TWY B (ACC area) will not arm/de-arm prior to taxi.
       8.4.2.4. Aircraft with forward firing munitions should taxi so as to eliminate or minimize
       the time the aircraft is pointing toward an inhabited area.
       8.4.2.5. All aircraft will be armed after a pre-takeoff inspection on the published arming
       heading in the arming area adjacent to the departing runway.
   8.4.3. Takeoff.
       8.4.3.1. Takeoff directions should be selected, as far as safety permits, to allow the most
       expeditious route to the desired test area; however, takeoffs with externally loaded
       ordnance will normally not be made on RWY 1 for Cat I, II, and III ordnance. Under
       extenuating circumstances, the 96 OG/CC may authorize RWY 1 departures for Cat I, II
       or III ordnance. Prior approval is required.
EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013                                                                     109


8.5. Test Area Procedures for Ordnance Delivery Missions.
   8.5.1. Clearance into a restricted/warning area must be obtained from EMC. Clearance from
   EMC into a restricted/warning area and profile is not clearance to release. Clearance to
   release on the test area must be obtained from the appropriate test area control authority
   listed in Table 8.1 or IAW paragraph 8.2
   8.5.2. The flight lead shall check in with call sign, mission number, type ordnance (unless
   prohibited for security reasons) and number of aircraft in the flight.
   8.5.3. Armament switches will remain OFF/SAFE until the aircraft enters the specified
   safety profile for the test area as defined in the safety appendix of the TD. At that time, the
   munitions may be prepared for release (warm-up, station selection, etc.) up to, but not
   including, final release arming. Final release arming selection will be made on base leg or
   final for diving deliveries. For level and climbing deliveries, final release arming will not be
   made until wings level on final within the safety profile. Release arming will be returned to
   the OFF/SAFE position after each delivery if the aircraft will depart the safety profile.
   8.5.4. During test missions, aircraft carrying ordnance, will call "HOT" or "DRY" on both
   the base leg and final run-in position of each pass. The base call is required whether range
   instrumentation is being used or not. Aircraft position at the time of this call will be
   dependent on the mission profile shape and size, but will be no less than 30 seconds from the
   point at which the ordnance leaves the aircraft. The test area control authority will
   acknowledge each call and clear the pass "HOT" or "DRY." If no acknowledgment is
   received, the pass will be completed "DRY" and reaffirmed "DRY" by the aircraft
   commander. Exception: “HOT/DRY” base calls are not required for training missions.
   8.5.5. Patterns and applicable test area procedures for a test mission will conform to the TD.
   8.5.6. Prior to clearing off the test area on any ordnance delivery mission, each aircraft will
   be visually checked for hung ordnance. If a visual check cannot be accomplished, the pilot
   will assume hung ordnance and will follow the hung ordnance procedures. A visual check
   may be made by:
      8.5.6.1. The delivery aircraft, if the crew has the station in sight,
      8.5.6.2. The delivery aircraft or RCO, if the number of impacts can be counted,
      8.5.6.3. The RCO--aircraft will not descend below 200 ft AGL nor fly within 500 ft slant
      range of the tower during the fly-by check (Cat I and II ordnance only) or,
      8.5.6.4. A chase aircraft.
   8.5.7. Pilots will safe all armament switches prior to departing the test area.

                                           Chapter 9

                                   RANGE OPERATIONS

9.1. Purpose. This chapter provides guidance for operations within the Eglin range complex
and the expenditure of ordnance from fighter/attack/Forward Air Control (FAC)/AC-130 aircraft,
and helicopters on test missions or weapons employment training missions. Modification of
these procedures, if necessary, and complete procedures for any other test area will be contained
in the safety appendix to the TD documenting the individual training programs. All coordinates
listed are based on the World Geodetic Survey, 1984 (WGS 84), rounded to the nearest 100th
and derived from AAC Technical Facilities Manual, Volume II, July 1996. For further
information on available facilities as well as operating procedures within the Eglin Range
Complex, refer to EAFBI 13-212 Range Planning and Operations.
   9.1.1. Squadron commanders/division chiefs and the 96 OG/CC will be responsible for
   approving TDs based on risk level (Low, Medium, or High). Safety notification rules for
   medium-risk and high-risk tests remain in effect. Test Group andWing leadership must
   remain aware and informed of elevated risk (i.e., medium, high) testing.
9.2. Policies.
   9.2.1. Populated areas will be avoided as much as possible when carrying external ordnance.
   9.2.2. When operating outside the boundaries of the Eglin reservation and not on an
   approved low-level route with a lower allowable minimum altitude, the minimum altitude of
   1,500 ft AGL will be maintained (500 ft AGL for helicopters). Aircrew are encouraged to fly
   at the highest practical altitude consistent with mission accomplishment in order to minimize
   the noise impact on the local community. Avoid overflying private homes and buildings to
   the maximum extent possible.
9.3. Test Area Safety. In the event an aircraft crashes on the test area, the flight or deputy
leader will assist the appropriate test area control authority in determining the exact crash
location for relay to rescue crews. The flight/deputy leader will assist the Test Area
Controller/RCO until released or fuel state requires departure.
9.4. General Test Area Procedures.
   9.4.1. Aircraft will be cleared into and out of Eglin restricted airspace by EMC. Munitions
   release will be IAW Chapter 8.
   9.4.2. Patterns that require maneuvering outside restricted airspace will require prior
   coordination with EMC, who will attempt to obtain the necessary airspace from the
   appropriate agency.
   9.4.3. A maximum of four aircraft may be scheduled in a test area at any one time, unless
   exceptions allowed by other guidance and approved by the RCO.
   9.4.4. Up to three dissimilar types aircraft of compatible airspeed will be allowed in the
   weapons delivery pattern at any one time. Exceptions to these rules are authorized only with
   the specific approval of the 96 OG/CC, 85 TEG/CC, 1 SOW/CC, or 919 SOW/CC for
   aircraft under their operational control. A copy of that approval will be provided to 96
   TW/SE.
EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013                                                                        111


9.5. Test Area Entry.
   9.5.1. Flights proceeding directly to the test area after takeoff will be handed off to EMC as
   soon as possible after departure. If the flight is scheduled to fly a low-level route prior to test
   area entry, the flight leader should request a VFR clearance at the appropriate initial point
   (North IP or East IP) and contact EMC prior to entry into the restricted area.
   9.5.2. Restricted Area Clearance. The flight leader will contact EMC for clearance into the
   restricted area. This call will include call sign, mission number, and number of aircraft in the
   flight. Permission to enter the restricted area must be received prior to entry. Note:
   Clearance into a restricted area from EMC is not permission to expend ordnance on the test
   area.
9.6. Test Area C-62 Procedures.
   9.6.1. Flight lead will give flight call sign, number and type of aircraft, number and type
   ordnance, sequence of events, targets, release conditions, type of patterns to be flown, and
   verify any laser operations. Ordnance will not be expended without clearance from the Test
   Area Controller/RCO. Flight leaders will inform the Test Area Controller/RCO of any
   changes to events.
   9.6.2. Holding Points and Altitudes: If immediate clearance into the restricted area or the
   test area is not possible, flights entering from other than low-level routes will hold at an
   assigned altitude and holding point until cleared by the controlling agency (ATC or EMC).
   Flights entering from the northern low-level route may hold at the north initial point (IP).
      9.6.2.1. Entry from Low-Level Routes. Entry onto the test area directly from a low-level
      route will be flown at the following altitudes:

   employment training. Also, it can be used as an unmanned, unscored test area for random
   attacks.
   9.7.2. Entry/Holding.
       9.7.2.1. Range Clearance. Normal entry will be from the Freeport Bridge orbit point;
       however, EMC can provide entry from other locations. When the flight is cleared to the
       assigned test area frequency, the flight leader will establish contact with the Test Area
       Controller/RCO (call sign “C-52 Control/Darken”). Flight lead will give flight call sign,
       number and type of aircraft, number and type ordnance, sequence of events, target,
       release conditions, type of patterns to be flown, verify bomb fuse type, and verify any
       laser operations. The flight will be cleared on the test area or directed to hold. The flight
EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013                                                                      113


     will be advised of any restrictions to delivery patterns and given the current altimeter
     setting. Most recent wind information will also be provided. All flight members will
     acknowledge this information. Ordnance will not be expended without clearance from
     the Test Area Controller/RCO. Flight leaders will inform the Test Area Controller/RCO
     of any changes to events.
         9.7.2.1.1. AC-130 Clearance Procedures. Comply with HFI 11-201, Fixed and
         Rotary Wing Operations range clearing procedures for C-52.

         northeast of the Freeport Bridge at a minimum altitude of 2,000 ft MSL (day) and
         4,000 ft MSL (night).
  9.7.3. Test Area Procedures: Specific allowable test area procedures are defined by the
  program’s Test Directive and associated Safety Appendix. EAFBI 13-212 lists current
  training targets, release conditions and, as appropriate, may be referenced in the Safety
  Appendix.
  9.7.4. Night Procedures.
     9.7.4.1. All night procedures require an RCO.
     9.7.4.2. During the Freeport Bridge entry, the flight will attain proper spacing on the turn
     to downwind or as briefed by the flight lead.
     9.7.4.3. When a cargo-type flare ship is to be used on Test Area C-52N, flights will enter
     the test area at or above 4,000 ft MSL.
     9.7.4.4. A maximum of four delivery aircraft will be in the night test area pattern at any
     time. Four aircraft are authorized only if one is being used for flare delivery.
     9.7.4.5. The flare launch aircraft will fly a circular or elliptical right-hand pattern.
     9.7.4.6. When operating with a flare delivery aircraft, all ordnance delivery patterns will
     be left hand. Attack heading is restricted to 090 deg±20 deg.
     9.7.4.7. Flares will not be dropped when surface winds exceed 15 knots or when the fire
     index, as determined by Natural Resources Branch (96 CEG/CEVSN), presents an
     unacceptable hazard.
     9.7.4.8. When flares are employed and the restrictions previously outlined in this chapter
     are complied with, aircraft are authorized to expend ordnance against any target within C-
     52N. When flare illumination is not used, deliveries are limited to targets illuminated by
     ground lights. At least two ground lights will be illuminated for weapons delivery using
     ground illumination only.
     9.7.4.9. Descent from base leg altitude will not be made until after the turn to final is
     initiated, visual orientation with the target area is accomplished, and the flare ship is in
     sight.
     9.7.4.10. It is the responsibility of the ordnance delivery aircrew to maintain safe
     separation from the flare ship.
     9.7.4.11. Flare aircraft procedures (SUU-25):
 114                                                             EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013


          9.7.4.11.1. If a flare should ignite while still in the dispenser, the SUU-25 will be
          jettisoned.
          9.7.4.11.2. Aircraft carrying SUU-25 flare dispensers will select only one station at a
          time, and will dispense all flares from one station prior to dispensing flares from the
          other station.
          9.7.4.11.3. Alternate release of flares and weapons by the same aircraft is prohibited.
          9.7.4.11.4. Minimum altitude for flare deliveries is 3,000 ft AGL. Note: All LUU-2
          deliveries will be planned to ensure flare is burnt out by 500 ft AGL.
9.8. Test Area B-6 (Eglin, Field 6, Army Ranger Camp, Camp Rudder). No aircraft will
overfly Eglin Field 6 below 1,500 ft AGL (1,700 ft MSL) unless intending to land there or with
specific approval of 96 OG/CC. This no-overflight area has a 1 NM radius centered on the Field
6 Runway intersection. In cases where overflight approval is granted, the responsible project
officer will provide Camp Rudder operations personnel with information on date, time, altitude,
speed, type of aircraft, and reason for the operation 48 hours in advance of the scheduled
overflight.
9.9. Rejoins/Departures.
   9.9.1. The Test Area Controller/RCO will broadcast a "5 MINUTES UNTIL END OF TEST
   AREA PERIOD " information call. Flight leaders will make sure their flights are clear of the
   test area at the conclusion of their test area period, or coordinate an extension through EMC.
   9.9.2. After join-up and prior to departing the test area, the flight leader will advise the RCO
   and Test Area Controller of any hung/unexpended ordnance by type and aircraft.
   Hung/unexpended ordnance procedures are in Chapter 7.
   9.9.3. The flight leader will pass recovery requirements to EMC prior to departing the test
   area.
   9.9.4. Emergency Departures. In an emergency, a pilot may clear the test area from any
   position and proceed as necessary to the field of intended landing. Extreme caution should
   be used in departing R-2914. As soon as possible notify EMC with intentions.
9.10. Helicopter and AC-130 Gunship Weapon Systems Malfunction.
   9.10.1. The aircraft commander will be notified of any weapon system malfunction.
   9.10.2. The aircraft will maintain an orbit over assigned test area until the weapons can be
   placed in a safe condition.
   9.10.3. If system cannot be safed, or a hung flare condition exists, an emergency should be
   declared. On recovery, populated areas should not be overflown. Gun systems should not be
   directed at populated areas. AC-130s use guidance IAW HFI 11-201 for specific jettison
   procedures in the Eglin ranges.
9.11. RCO Procedures. If an RCO is used to control a test area, the RCO will:
   9.11.1. Prior to departing for the test area:
       9.11.1.1. Determine test area status and accessibility.
       9.11.1.2. Check on any deviations to scheduled test area missions.
EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013                                                                       115


       9.11.1.3. Receive any additional instructions from the duty controller or SOF.
       9.11.1.4. Be familiar with the safety appendix to the TD.
   9.11.2. Be in position on the designated test area before the flight is cleared onto the test
   area.
   9.11.3. Determine the operational status of the test area items listed in Table 9.2. according
   to AFI 13-212.

   9.11.4. Ensure test area facilities, personnel, and weather are suitable for test area operations.
   9.11.5. Brief test area personnel on the scheduled missions and control procedures.
   9.11.6. Confirm with the Test Area Controller that all range gates are closed and the test area
   has been visually cleared of all personnel prior to flight clearance on the test area.
   9.11.7. Obtain current altimeter setting and information on any activity that may restrict test
   area operations from EMC.
   9.11.8. Obtain flight lineup, crew numbers, events, and targets to be used from all flights
   prior to entering the test area.
   9.11.9. Provide flight with clearance into the test area, the current altimeter setting, winds
   and weather observations, profile/pattern restrictions (if any), and assigned targets (when
   applicable).
   9.11.10. Assume procedural control of all flights entering the test area and make sure aircraft
   are operated according to sound safety practices and appropriate directives.
9.11.11. Observe all aircraft in the pattern insofar as possible, noting specifically pattern
and delivery techniques and spacing.
   9.11.12. Issue clearance for each delivery upon determining that aircraft position and
   spacing will allow release of the appropriate ordnance and subsequent safe recovery of the
   aircraft.
   9.11.13. Observe each aircraft flight path during the final phase of delivery.
   9.11.14. Notify the aircrew when they are unsafe or have committed a foul (as established in
   AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures).
   9.11.15. Assess fouls and take corrective action according to command directives.
   9.11.16. Require all flight members to acknowledge directive radio transmissions.
   9.11.17. Monitor bird activity in the target area, especially during hours around dawn and
   dusk, and advise aircrew members.
116                                                         EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013


  9.11.18. When flights are attempting to meet a firm time over target (TOT), verify weapons
  impact with a "SPLASH" call.
  9.11.19. Monitor bomb plotting and event/score documentation in the control tower.
  9.11.20. Ensure an orderly flow of missions on and off the test area by advising flights when
  they are approaching the final 5 minutes of their test area period.
  9.11.21. As soon as departing flights have joined up, obtain from them a summary of
  hung/unexpended ordnance by type and aircraft.
  9.11.22. For those flights exercising forward air controller (FAC) profiles on a manned test
  area, surrender tactical control to the FAC during the employment phases of the mission. All
  FAC controlling aircraft on any Eglin range/test area must be certified by the Chief RCO for
  each range upon which the individual will perform FAC duties (e.g., Range 52 Chief RCO to
  work Range 52, Range 62 Chief RCO to work Range 62). Monitor the conduct of the flight
  for compliance with stipulated safety criteria.
  9.11.23. For those flights exercising random attack profiles, surrender RCO responsibilities
  to the FAC or flight lead will make sure the test area is clear and all personnel have
  evacuated the complex before entering the test area.
  9.11.24. In addition to those duties outlined above, the night RCO will:
  9.11.24.1. Make sure Jackson Guard has been consulted to determine if the burning index
  will allow flare delivery and surface winds do not exceed 15 knots.
      9.11.24.2. If requested, establish flare drop sequence, altitude, delay, and burnout
      altitude with the flare ship.
      9.11.24.3. Monitor burned out or dud flares and immediately notifies flight members of
      potential hazards. Hold fighters high and dry if burned out or dud flares present a hazard,
      resuming operation only when the hazard has passed.
      9.11.24.4. Make sure all delivery aircrew call "FLARE SHIP IN SIGHT" when turning
      final if a cargo ship is used for flaring or when a fighter flare ship delivery pattern
      opposes the fighter pattern.
      9.11.24.5. Monitor aircraft spacing throughout the pattern with special emphasis on the
      final approach, recovery, and turn to downwind leg.
  9.11.25. Crash Procedures. See paragraph 7.13.
  9.11.26. Emergency Procedures: In accordance with Chapter 7.
  9.11.27. Weather:
      9.11.27.1. Delivery patterns will not be allowed when the weather is below the specified
      minimum for that event. When a weather observer is not present on the test area, a pilot
      report (PIREP) can be used as an aid in determining test area weather.
      9.11.27.2. The RCO can request additional test area weather observations when
      conditions so dictate. Additional weather requirements should be coordinated with 96
      WF as early as possible.
  9.11.28. Strafe Target Scoring:
EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013                                                                      117


     9.11.28.1. Low-angle strafe scoring will normally be accomplished on the acoustically
     scored targets. Acoustical scores will be recorded and the number of hits transmitted to
     the delivery aircraft after each pass.
     9.11.28.2. When strafe target manual scoring or maintenance is accomplished while
     aircraft are in the delivery pattern, the RCO will direct the flight to avoid overflight of the
     strafe target area by 1,500 ft MSL, permit no strafing, and allow weapons deliveries only
     on the nuclear target. The target team chief will illuminate the red warning lights inside
     the control tower and contact the RCO prior to departing for the strafe target area. Upon
     return, the team chief will again notify the RCO confirming that all personnel are off the
     test area.
     9.11.28.3. Test area personnel will not normally hoist the strafe panels when surface
     winds exceed 20 knots.
  9.11.29. Weapons Delivery Scoring Record. The RCO is responsible for proper completion
  of the weapons delivery scoring record. Although test area personnel actually complete the
  scoring record while the mission is in progress, it is essential that the RCO verify its accuracy
  by comparing it with the delivery data that was recorded in the control tower.
 118                                                        EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013


                                          Chapter 10

    OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES FOR THE EMPLOYMENT OF ELECTRONIC
       PROTECTIVE MEASURES (EPM), CHAFF, FLARES, AND LASERS

10.1. Purpose. This chapter provides guidance for procedures for the employment of EPM,
chaff, flares, and lasers within the Eglin range complex. Frequency requirements will be
coordinated with the DoD Gulf Area Frequency Coordinator (DoD GAFC (96 CS/SCXF)). 96
OSS, Frequency Scheduling & Deconfliction (96 OSS/OSOQ) ) is the initial point of contact for
notification of all Radio Frequency Interference (RFI), and will exercise authority to terminate
radiation of the detected source of interference. The DoD GAFC will be the final authority for
resolution of frequency conflicts/interference.
10.2. Responsibilities.
   10.2.1. Flight leaders, individual pilots, or Electronic Warfare Officers (EWO) will include
   applicable portions of this instruction during flight briefings.
   10.2.2. Commanders of associate and transient organizations using self-protection systems
   are responsible for compliance with this chapter.
   10.2.3. The host unit is responsible for providing instructions and procedures to units
   visiting the Eglin complex for missions involving EPM, chaff, or flare, regardless of whether
   or not the unit launches or recovers at EAFB.
   10.2.4. Units desiring to deploy chaff and EPM must submit mission requests in advance to
   96 OSS/OSOQ to coordinate the activity with FAA Jacksonville Center. If normal submittal
   times are not met, then blackboards will have to be submitted by 1300L one day prior to
   mission date. 96 RANMS/DOS will be responsible for notifying the organization scheduling
   representative when missions are denied the use of chaff, flares, or EPM.
   10.2.5. Frequency Control and Analysis (FCA) (96 OSS/OSOQ) is responsible for the
   scheduling of EPM and chaff within Eglin Restricted Areas and W-151/W-470. The area of
   responsibility is bounded on the north by 31º00’N, on the east by 83º30’W, on the south by
   28º 15’N, and on the west by 86º48’W.
   10.2.6. Operations officers will ensure all aircrew conducting EPM, carrying chaff, or flares
   on Eglin Complex fields or test areas understand the provisions of this instruction before
   operations are attempted. Additionally, they will establish procedures to ensure aircrew
   know the areas and times during which they are scheduled to employ EPM, chaff, or flares.
   EPM, chaff, and flares will not be employed in the Eglin test area complex unless scheduled
   in compliance with this instruction (as appropriate) and authorized by an appropriate TD and
   applicable Radio Frequency Authorization (RFA).
   10.2.7. All aircraft conducting EPM or employing chaff are required to monitor 243.0 MHz
   (UHF Guard channel) and stop employment operations upon hearing a “STOP (or CEASE)
   BUZZER/ STREAMBURST” call from the appropriate controlling agency (e.g., EMC,
   Military Radar Unit (MRU), or CCF (call sign “CHAMBER”)).
       10.2.7.1. After “STOP (or CEASE) BUZZER/STREAMBURST” has been given and the
       aircraft has ceased EPM, then FCA will try to determine when and what part of the EPM
EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013                                                                 119


       can be resumed. If the EPM band causing the problem cannot be separated or the
       frequency bands cannot be determined, then the EPM is to remain off until the safety
       issue or emergency has been cleared and FCA has given the approval to resume.
   10.2.8. Each unit will provide 96 OSS/OSOQ the name and phone numbers of its operations
   officer to contact for interference resolution.
10.3. Authorized Systems.
   10.3.1. Chaff and Flare Systems.

       from 96 CG/SCXF and scheduled through 96 RANMS/DOSF.
10.4. Scheduling.
   10.4.1. EPM, chaff, and flares should be requested as deletable items, if appropriate, to
   preclude missions being nonscheduled for conflicts in this area.
   10.4.2. Missions desiring to use EPM will require inclusion of the appropriate RFA line
   numbers on the mission request form. EPM will be scheduled on a mission-to-mission basis,
   regardless of the working area.
   10.4.3. Individual aircrew or units will contact their organization’s scheduling agency if
   changes to the schedule are desired. These changes must be coordinated through 96 RANMS
   scheduling prior to 1300L on the day preceding the mission.
10.5. Departure Procedures. Arming and de-arming of chaff and flare systems will be
conducted in the normal arm/de-arm areas. Start, taxi, arming, and takeoff will be according to
the procedures in Chapter 8.
 120                                                         EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013


10.6. Flare Employment Procedures. All missions employing flares will be scheduled as hot
missions. Any airspace changes must be coordinated through the JTTOCC, and informed that
the mission intends to drop flares. JTTOCC shall notify the Coast Guard of changes in flare
activity.
   10.6.1. W-151/W-470: Flares may be employed within W-151 and W-470 provided the
   aircraft is above 1,500 ft AGL or the aircraft is below 1,500 ft AGL and at least 3 NM from
   any surface vessel, platform, or land mass. Flare operations within warning areas will be
   under flight lead control and will be limited by exception only.
   10.6.2. Overland: Flares may be employed over the Eglin Reservation only. Avoid
   expending flares over populated areas, personnel, or structures. Minimum release altitude
   over authorized test areas is 200 ft AGL, and 500 ft AGL when not over authorized test
   areas. Further restrictions may be imposed by 96 TW Range Safety and central scheduling
   authority (96 RANMS/DOS) when required.
10.7. Chaff Employment Procedures: All missions employing chaff shall be scheduled.
Wind conditions and complexity of air traffic may make it necessary for EMC to terminate chaff
dispersal. Chaff dispersal outside the parameters identified in this chapter must be coordinated
according to FAA Handbook 7610.4, Special Military Operations and approved by the GAFC.
   10.7.1. W-151/W-470:     Chaff will normally (depending upon test/training mission
   requirements) be authorized within W-151/W-470, provided it is included under an
   applicable RFA and meets the criteria for use outlined in the RFA.
       10.7.1.1. Flight leads will ensure that operational chaff is not employed under any
       conditions that would cause it to drift outside of the scheduled working area, particularly
       to the south where it could interfere with the Gulf Crossing Air Routes or into any of the
       corridors or affect air traffic facilities.
       10.7.1.2. Operations within the warning areas will be under flight lead control and
       limited by exception only.
   10.7.2. Overland: Chaff drops in R-2915A, north of Auxiliary Field 6 and west of A-77, are
   limited to 2,000 ft AGL and below. All other areas in R-2915A are limited to 4,000 ft AGL
   and below. Chaff over C-52 in R-2914A is limited to 4,000 ft AGL and below. No chaff is
   permitted in the North-South or East-West VFR Corridors. In all other areas of Eglin
   restricted airspace, chaff is limited to 2,000 ft AGL and below. Strictly adhere to chaff type
   requirements defined in the RFA (i.e., cannot use wide-band chaff when RFA permits use of
   only narrow-band chaff).
       10.7.2.1. Wind conditions and traffic complexity may make it necessary for ATC to
       terminate chaff expenditure authorization. The final authority rests with EMC.
10.8. EPM Employment Procedures: All missions employing EPM shall be scheduled.
Normally, operations for F-15 Internal Countermeasures Set (ICS) I-band and below will be
approved, without exception, within W-151C, D, E, and F, provided operating under an
approved RFA. Flight leads, individual pilots, and EWOs are responsible for ensuring that EPM
is not conducted outside of the areas and times scheduled. Frequency interference problems will
be reported in real-time to the JTTOCC. 96 OSS/OSOQ FCA will coordinate with the
appropriate organization operations officer(s) for immediate resolution.
EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013                                                                   121


10.9. Recoveries.
   10.9.1. Pilots will ensure all EPM, chaff, and flare switches are OFF/SAFE prior to
   departing the test and training area.
   10.9.2. Aircraft returning to EAFB with unexpended chaff or flares may recover to the
   overhead pattern.
   10.9.3. De-arming will be according to Chapter 8.
   10.9.4. Following de-arming, aircraft may return to parking on the Test Ramp according to
   AACMAN 91-202, Designation of Explosives Laden Vehicle Routes, Combat Aircraft
   Parking Areas, Explosives Loading/Unloading Areas and Arm/De-arm Areas.
   10.9.5. Any malfunction of chaff or flare systems will be handled IAW with Chapter 7
   procedures.
10.10. Airborne Laser Operations.
   10.10.1. In order to minimize the safety hazard and maximize the opportunity for effective
   testing/training, the procedures outlined in the following paragraphs will be used when
   employing a targeting pod (e.g., LANTIRN/LITENING/SNIPER), or any other airborne laser
   designation system.
      10.10.1.1. The training or eye-safe laser (1.54 microns) may be used during any mission
      on or off the Eglin complex, including low-level routes. Aircrew will confirm the laser is
      set to 1.54 microns during the preflight inspection. In-flight, aircrew will confirm that a
      "T" is present on the cockpit targeting pod display prior to lasing. If the pod power is
      cycled after a laser failure indication, the laser may power up in the tactical "L" setting
      (1.06 microns). Confirmation of the "T" indication is mandatory to prevent potentially
      serious eye damage to ground personnel.
      10.10.1.2. Tactical airborne lasers (1.06 microns) may be used for test or training
      missions on the Eglin test area complex targets listed in Table 10.1:

Table 10.1. Laser Targets
                               TARGET                RUN-IN

                            designators for altitude updates only;
                            see HFI 11-201, for required
                            procedures.
122                                                          EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013


  10.10.2. Airborne Laser Operations Restrictions and Procedures.
      10.10.2.1. When scheduling missions or requesting airspace, test engineers or squadron
      schedulers will indicate on the Center Scheduling Enterprise (CSE) mission request that
      tactical lasing operations will be performed during the mission. If the mission request
      forms do not reflect this desire, airborne lasing cannot be performed. Real-time requests
      for lasing will not be authorized.
      10.10.2.2. Once airborne and on range, aircrew are required to get clearance from the
      appropriate test area control authority for airborne laser operations, and range control
      must verify that eye protection is being used and the hazardous area is clear. Aircrew
      should make a positive "laser on" and "laser off" call during weapon delivery passes.
  10.10.3. Weapon Delivery Procedures.
      10.10.3.1. For any delivery where the target will be directly lased, the aircrew will not
      activate the laser until the target has been positively identified, an unrestricted line of
      sight exists, and a steady track on the target is assured. The aircrew should cease lasing
      after weapon release for unguided munitions, after weapon impact for guided weapons, or
      if the laser drifts towards the edge of the clear area.
      10.10.3.2. For deliveries where the target is not directly lased (i.e., Continuously
      Designated Impact Point (CDIP)/ Continuously Computed Impact Point (CCIP)), the
      aircrew will not activate the laser until rolled-out wings level on final, and the laser (or
      pipper) is aimed within the clear area. A good rule of thumb is to activate the laser at 5
      sec prior to release. Cease lasing after weapon release.
      10.10.3.3. The minimum altitude for lasing will be no lower than 500 ft AGL.
EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013                                                                       123

                                SUPERSONIC OPERATIONS

11.1. Supersonic Operations. Supersonic flight operations over the Eglin Land Range and the
Eglin Gulf Test and Training Range shall be conducted IAW AFI 13-201, Airspace Management
and the Eglin Supersonic Waiver 75-1.
   11.1.1. Supersonic training may be accomplished over water above 10,000 ft MSL and at
   least 25 NM from the coast. Supersonic training profiles below 10,000 ft MSL will be flown
   a minimum of 25 NM from the coast if on a southerly heading, and a minimum of 50 NM
   from the coast if on a northerly heading.
   11.1.2. Supersonic flight test profiles must be approved through the ATR/SB process and
   adhere to the following restrictions:
       11.1.2.1. All overland profiles below FL300 shall be performed on Test Area B-70 and
       shall be restricted to a maximum over-pressure of 3.5 pounds per square foot (PSF) at a
       distance of 5 NM from the aircraft ground track. In no case will an over-pressure
       exceeding 3.5 PSF be allowed outside of the Eglin Land Range from the surface to
       FL300.
       11.1.2.2. All overland profiles shall terminate in a level flight attitude so as not to expand
       the over-pressure envelope towards the ground.
       11.1.2.3. Vehicular traffic on state roads and all personnel within the reservation shall be
       adequately protected from over-pressure exposure during scheduled runs.
       11.1.2.4. No supersonic missions over land shall be flown unless the test engineer has
       notified the Public Affairs Office (96 TW/PA) the day prior to the mission. The test
       engineer should again notify 96 TW/PA 1 hour prior to aircraft takeoff to confirm the
       mission status and update any changes. Aircrew shall confirm that this has been done
       before going to the aircraft.
       11.1.2.5. Test teams shall make every effort to minimize dry supersonic passes overland.
       11.1.2.6. Supersonic flight test profiles may be accomplished over water above 10,000 ft
       MSL at least 25 NM from the coast. Supersonic flight test profiles below 10,000 ft MSL
       will be flown a minimum of 25 NM from the coast if on a southerly heading, and a
       minimum of 50 NM from the coast if on a northerly heading.
       11.1.2.7. For supersonic flight test runs below 10,000 ft MSL, a boat check will be
       accomplished prior to commencing the test run to ensure there are no boats within 5 NM
       of the ground track.
 124                                                           EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013


                                           Chapter 12

                         REMOTELY PILOTED AIRCRAFT (RPA)

12.1. General. UAS operations are increasing on the Eglin Ranges. RPA use airspace and
airfields to conduct both test and training missions. Training missions include initial
qualification training, mission qualification training and proficiency training of small RPA
operators and sensor operators. This chapter will provide information on airfields, airspace,
airspace request processes, safety requirements, emergency procedures, and weapons
employment.
12.2. Airfields for RPA. Depending on the type and size of RPA, a prepared runway/landing
zone may or may not be required. Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (SUAS) and Micro Air
Vehicles (MAV) may be hand launched (e.g., WASP, Raven), pneumatically launched (e.g.,
Shadow, Scan Eagle), or takeoff from a runway (e.g., Hunter, Dakota, Pioneer). There currently
is no universally accepted definition of RPA, SUAS, or MAV between DoD or commercial
vendors. From a safety perspective, anything above 20 knots and 1 pound can be lethal. SUAS
may be recovered by net, skyhook, belly in with no landing gear, or land on a runway. Hand-
launched and pneumatic-launched SUAS, to include Vertical Takeoff or Landing (VTOL)
SUAS, may operate from open fields or roads anywhere approved on the Eglin Land Range. In
addition, RPA may operate from a boat on the bays surrounding Eglin’s south side or some of
the waterways contained within Eglin’s restricted or warning areas as approved within the scope
of the TD and Safety Appendix. Choctaw NOLF, Duke Field, Field 1, and Field 6 support
manned test and training operations of both fixed wing aircraft and helicopters. The following
airfields/landing zones are located on the Eglin Land Range:
   12.2.1. Choctaw Navy Outlying Field (NOLF). Choctaw NOLF is located at the western
   end of the Eglin Land Range (outside restricted airspace) and is operated by the Navy at
   Whiting Field for Navy pilot training. There is one asphalt runway, 18/36, 8,000 ft by 150 ft.
   When the ATC tower is in operation, the airspace is nonjoint use military Class D. All other
   times the airspace is Class E. RPA operations in the past have been from the diagonal
   taxiway with flight operations to the east side of the field. The Class D adjoinsR-2915A.
   12.2.2. Eglin Auxiliary (Aux) Field 6. Eglin Aux Field 6 (Test Area B-6) is located in the
   north center of R-2915A. There is an asphalt landing zone, 18/36, 4,000 ft by 60 ft with
   concrete pads on each end for helicopter and CV-22 operations. There is no ATC tower at
   the field. There is a UHF radio repeater that provides communications to the ERCF from
   aircraft and operators on the ground. SUAS may be launched and recovered from the landing
   zone or taxiways provided coordination with other missions and the Army Rangers has been
   done. AFSOC SUAS training and various one-of-a-kind/unique experimental RPA have
   used this facility.
   12.2.3. Eglin Aux Field 7. Eglin Aux Field 7 (Test Area B-12) is located in the central part
   of R-2915A. There are various closed runways of various states of disrepair which may be
   adequate for SUAS operations depending on the size of wheels and strength of landing gear.
   Hand- and pneumatic-launched SUAS would be able to operate provided the surface is
   adequate for recovery or a soft recovery system is used. Field 7 offers a more remote
   location for explosives and laser testing; however, it is often difficult to schedule due to high-
EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013                                                                  125


   priority large footprint missions on Test Area B-70 nearby. There is no ATC tower at the
   field.
   12.2.4. Eglin Aux Field 1. Eglin Aux Field 1 (Test Area C-5) is located in the northwest
   section of R-2914A. There is a 4,000 ft landing zone running 18/36. SUAS launches and
   recoveries may be made from other hard surfaces of the old airfield. There is no ATC tower
   at the field. There are some available office buildings, storage and Test Area C-72 control
   nearby.
   12.2.5. Santa Rosa Island (SRI) RPA Operations. Potentially suitable launch and recovery
   areas are located at Test Site A-15 on Santa Rosa Island in R-2915B. There are two launch
   and recovery areas made of concrete. There is no ATC tower at the two sites. Because of
   the close proximity to Hurlburt Field’s Class Delta airspace and the East-West Corridor,
   special safety precautions typically apply to these Test Directive Safety Appendices.
   12.2.6. Eglin Aux Field 3. Eglin Aux Field 3 (Duke Field) is located to the north of EAFB
   in the 14 CFR Part 93 North-South Corridor. See Chapter 2 and Chapter 5 for information
   regarding this field. When the ATC tower is in operation, the airspace is nonjoint use
   military Class D. This airspace adjoins R-2918. An FAA facility Certificate of
   Authorization (COA) must be established for RPA operations from this field, through the
   Class Delta airspace, and into restricted areas.
12.2.7. Other Airfields/Landing Zones. As new customers and requirements develop in the
future, new airfields/landing zones may be constructed on the range through existing Range
Configuration Control Committee (RCCC) and Range Development Executive Steering
Committee (RDESC) or various existing areas used for RPA operations where approved through
Test Directive, Environmental, and Safety review processes. 96th Test Wing personnel
responsible for test and training execution will be able to provide specific information. When
appropriate, new airfields/landing zones will be added to this document.
12.3. Airspace for SUAS. The USAF and the FAA require RPA operations be conducted in
restricted and warning airspace where possible, IAW the Memorandum of Agreement for
Operations of RPA in the NAS (24 Sep 07) or waivered/authorized per specific RPA type and
operations area by the FAA. The Eglin Range has eight restricted areas and two warning areas
which may be used for RPA operations. See Chapter 3 for descriptions of restricted and
warning areas under the management of the Eglin Airspace Management Office and available
via the Center Scheduling Enterprise (CSE) system. RPA operations will be allowed in all
restricted areas and all warning areas provided all required TD, Environmental, and Safety
Reviews and approvals have been obtained and safety requirements are followed IAW AACI 91-
201, AAC Test Safety Review Process. Restricted airspace over land outside the Eglin
Reservation or land not owned by the government must be specifically approved on a case-by-
case basis through Eglin Safety (96 TW/SE). RPA operations over populated areas or private
land, yet within Eglin’s restricted airspace are designated as an elevated risk and require
appropriate approval levels in accordance with AACI 91-201 unless the particular RPA,
operator, training, and maintenance have established and demonstrated operation airworthiness
essentially equivalent to that of manned aircraft rates. The Santa Rosa Island Controlled Firing
Area may not be used for RPA operations. Operations outside of restricted and warning areas
may be accomplished provided the sponsor of the mission has obtained approval from the FAA
 126                                                          EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013


through an RPA Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA) (FAA Form 7711-2) or by the
FAA approving a nonjoint use military Class D facility COA.
   12.3.1. Nonjoint Use Military Class Delta Airspace. Choctaw NOLF and Hurlburt Field all
   have tower-controlled nonjoint use military Class Delta airspace. The FAA and DoD will
   allow RPA operations within nonjoint use military Class Delta airspace provided procedures
   are established and an ATC or facility COA is approved by the FAA and USAF/USN. RPA
   operations at the above locations must have an airworthiness certificate/statement for each
   system and the operator/observer must be qualified, meet currency proficiency requirements,
   and have a current FAA Class II medical certificate or military equivalent. In addition, a
   NOTAM describing the RPA operations must be issued at least 24 hours prior to flight. See
   FAA Aviation Safety Unmanned Aircraft Program Office (AIR-160) guidance.
   12.3.2. Class Golf Airspace. The FAA and DoD have agreed to allow military RPA
   operations within Class Golf airspace in the NAS for SUAS weighing less than 20 pounds
   and within visual range of the operator. The Class Golf airspace must be above land owned
   or leased by the government and not closer than 5 NM from any civil airport, below 1,200 ft
   AGL, and a NOTAM will be issued during the time of use. RPA operations must have an
   airworthiness certificate/statement for each system and the operator(s) and observer(s) must
   be qualified, meet current proficiency requirements, and have current FAA Class II medical
   certificates or military equivalent. In addition, a NOTAM must be issued at least 24 hours
   prior to operations. AFSOC/A3OUI will provide requesters with a Class Golf request
   checklist and coordinate the request with the Eglin Airspace Manager. There is a small area
   of land outside the northern boundary of R-2914A or Choctaw NOLF during times of use
   when the ATC tower is not manned which are considered Class G airspace for the purpose of
   operating military RPA. Call the Eglin Airspace Management Office for details to operate in
   this area. See FAA Order 1110.150, Small Unmanned Aircraft System Aviation Rulemaking
   Committee.
   12.3.3. Operations in the NAS. If there is a requirement to operate RPA outside of restricted
   or warning areas and not in nonjoint use military Class Delta airspace, or in Class Golf
   airspace, then an approved COA must be received from the FAA. RPA operations in the
   Eglin Part 93 airspace, North-South and East-West Corridors will require a COA. The Eglin
   Airspace Management Office can provide the details to apply for the COA.
12.4. Emergency Procedures. If an emergency should occur, all operators will adhere to the
following basic sequence: aviate, navigate, and communicate. Operators will refer to the
published emergency procedures checklists for the system they are operating. As soon as
practical, after completing the appropriate emergency procedures checklist, notify the controlling
agency and appropriate command and control (C2) agency of the description and extent of the
difficulty, intentions, assistance required, and other pertinent information. Operators will report
deviations from directives that occur as a result of an emergency IAW with applicable unit
governing guidance.
EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013                                                                    127



12.5. Weapon Employment. Small RPA typically do not directly employ weapons; however,
they are enablers for air-to-surface weapons delivery and may contain hazardous lasers or
designators. Depending upon the specific capabilities of the SUAS and the training and
certification of the operators, they may be employed for tasks ranging from target detection and
identification, to target area orientation for visual talk-on, to coordinate generation, to target
marking or laser target designation. In the event a RPA does employ a weapon, the Non-Nuclear
Munitions Safety Board stipulations, delivery, and hung ordnance procedures will be addressed
in the TD and associated appendices.

Terms
Arming—The operations performed by ground personnel that give control of the armament or
external stores system to the pilot (for example, removing safety pins or clips).
Authorized Loads (Eglin Operations—Stores loaded in a configuration according to the
aircraft flight handbook.
New or special test stores or a new configuration authorized by the Office for Aircraft
Compatibility (96 OG/OGMM) and the Airborne Test Review/Safety Board (ATR/SB).
Aircraft will not be loaded with both live and inert munitions of the same type at the same time
unless approved by the ATR/SB.
Certain nonexplosive stores used in accomplishing the TW missions.
These stores include instrumentation, camera, Electronic Countermeasures (ECM), or baggage
pods.
In many instances there may be no jettison capability for these stores.
De-arming—The operation performed by ground personnel that removes control of the
armament or external stores system from the pilot (for example, installing safety pins or clips).
Forward-Firing Ordnance—Rockets, missiles, or guns.
Hot Gun—Any armed gun system
Hung Flare—An attempted launch of a flare resulting in the flare protruding from the rear of the
dispenser.
Hung Ordnance—Munitions which did not release when all appropriate switch settings were
selected and the crew attempted release or firing.—If multiple or triple ejector racks are used,
ordnance is hung only on those rack stations for which release was attempted.
Hung Secure—Hung ordnance which remains securely attached to the aircraft suspension
equipment (i.e., in the same position as prior to the release attempt).
Hung Unsecure—Hung ordnance which failed to completely release, or appears to be in some
position other than original (for example, one of the lugs has released from the bomb rack).—For
rail-launched missiles, visible smoke from guidance control unit (GCU) or rocket motor where
detent blocks on the rail has likely retracted.
Inadvertent Release—Release of any store or object not commanded by the crew.—A double
release of a practice bomb or rocket from a SUU-20 when a single release was intended is not
considered an inadvertent release.
Inert Ordnance—Ordnance with all explosive or incendiary material removed.
Internal Countermeasures Set (ICS) —Internal ECM self-protection system currently
employed by the F-15 aircraft.
Jammed Gun—Any hot gun with ammunition that is malfunctioning or cannot be safed.
Jettison—The release of external stores through the jettison modes.
EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013                                                                  135


Salvo Jettison—Simultaneous jettison of all jettison capable external stores including
suspension equipment.
Selective Jettison—Jettison of stores from only one aircraft station.—This may include jettison
of suspension equipment on one station.
Manned Test Area—A TWtest area with a Test Area Controller/Range Control Officer and
potential scoring capability from the ground.—Equivalent to an Air Force Class A range (AFI
13-212 Volume 1, Weapons Ranges).
Munitions (Ordnance)/External Stores Categories for Developmental Weapons—During
development of the safety annex to the test directive, the 96 TW Range Safety Office (96
TW/SEU) will assign an appropriate category number (Cat I through VI) to munitions
(ordnance)/external stores as outlined below.—The assigned category will be reviewed by the
Risk Management Board (RMB) and any disagreements will be resolved by coordination
between the RMB and 96 TW/SEU.—The munitions category is used to determine the correct
takeoff runway and the decision tree/crash response to be used for landing with
hung/unexpended ordnance.—The type ordnance and number loaded on the aircraft must be
reported during aircraft emergencies.
Cat I.—All live ordnance containing primary explosive such as: Rockets and missiles with live
motors, Live bombs regardless of type of fuse, Live cluster bomb unit (CBU) munitions, and
LUU-series flare/ground markers
Cat II.—Ordnance with initiating explosive only, or with an incomplete explosive, such as: Inert
bombs with live fuses or boosters, Inert CBU munitions with live detonators, and MJU-2/7/10
flares, RR-170/180 chaff
Cat III.—Jettisonable nonexplosives such as Inert munitions, training shapes, instrumentation or
pods (fuel tanks are excluded) and all confirmed empty dispensers
Cat IV.—BDU-33, MK-106, or similar training ordnance.
Cat V.—Any gun loaded with live rounds of any type.
Cat VI.—Nonjettisonable, nonexplosive stores, that have the appearance of ordnance.—These
are stores that are completely inert and secured to aircraft with no method of release, such as
pods, training shapes, training missiles, and baggage pods.
Range Control Officer (RCO) —An Air Force member, contractor or DoD civilian individual
directly responsible for the conduct and safety of ordnance delivery.—RCOs must be qualified
according to AFI 13-212 Volume 1.
Release—The release of stores through a delivery mode.
Self-Protection Systems—Systems designed to be used for the protection of the individual
aircraft (for example, chaff, flare, and electronic protection measures).
Stop Buzzer—Call (normally made over guard frequency) requiring the immediate termination
of all chaff and ECM/EPM operations upon notification by the affected facility.—Commonly
known as “CEASE BUZZER” by aircrew.

Training Ordnance—Ordnance specifically designated for training.—BDU-33, MK-106, 2.75"
FFAR (inert rocket(s)), 20mm TP/TPT, and MK-82 inert (e.g., BDU-50) are classified as
training ordnance.—30mm TP/TPT can only be used against 30mm-designated targets.
Unmanned Test Area—A TWtest area without a Test Area Controller and no scoring capability
from the ground.—Equivalent to an Air Force Class C range (AFI 13-212 Volume 1).—Test
areas A-77, A-78, A-79, and B-7 are the only TW test areas considered to be unmanned.
Unexpended Ordnance—Munitions carried on an aircraft that have not been commanded to
release or be fired by the crew.
Unintentional Release—An accidental release induced by the aircrew.

                   NOISE ABATEMENT AND SAFETY PROCEDURES

A35.1. General Procedures. All military aircraft operating in airspace delegated to the Eglin
Radar Control Facility (ERCF) shall adhere to the following procedures to the maximum extent
possible unless established on a published approach/departure procedure or deviations are
dictated by Air Traffic Control (ATC), safety, or mission constraints/requirements. See Figure
A35.1 for a depiction of these restrictions.
   A35.1.1. Turbojet, Propeller, and Tiltrotor Aircraft. All turbojet, propeller, and tiltrotor
   aircraft shall maintain at or above 1,500 ft AGL over congested areas and will use minimum
   thrust levels consistent with safe operations. Aircraft within 5 NM of an airfield may
   descend once they are established on final approach or are in an established traffic pattern.
   See Table A35.1.
   A35.1.2. Helicopters. All helicopters shall maintain at or above 500 ft AGL over congested
   areas. Helicopters within 5 NM of an airfield may descend once they are established on final
   approach or are in an established traffic pattern. See Table A35.1.
   A35.1.3. Water Overflight. All aircraft shall remain at or above 500 ft AGL over water.

           All Aircraft Over Water                            500 ft AGL

A35.2. Specific Runway Selection and Flight Operating Procedures. To minimize aircraft
noise in the surrounding communities, all aircraft operating aircraft from EAFB or on Eglin
ranges shall use the following procedures consistent with aircraft configuration, MAJCOM
directives, aircraft technical orders, flight safety, and mission requirements:
   A35.2.1. Designation of primary runways.
       A35.2.1.1. RWY 12/19 shall be the primary runways when the tailwind component for
       either runway does not exceed 10 knots and the runways are dry in order to minimize
       overflight of the Valparaiso/Niceville areas. When RWY 1/30 are in use, RWY 1 shall
       be used for departures and RWY 30 shall be used for arrivals to the maximum extent
       possible.
       A35.2.1.2. RWY 12/30 is the primary VFR/overhead/Simulated Flameout (SFO)
       runway.
   A35.2.2. On all afterburner takeoffs, aircraft shall retard throttle out of afterburner as soon as
   safety permits, but not later than reaching 300 KIAS. Climb to 3,000 ft MSL at or below 350
 174                                                         EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013


   KIAS using military thrust or less. Afterburner takeoffs between 2300L and 0600L shall be
   limited to RWY 12, 19, or 30.
   A35.2.3. When departing RWY 1, aircraft shall climb runway heading until 3,000 ft MSL.
   Departure control should not allow turns over the towns of Valparaiso/Niceville until aircraft
   are at or above 3,000 ft MSL and north of the towns. Wingmen DO NOT use cutoff
   procedures to rejoin on the flight leader until above 3,000 ft MSL. Exception: If R-2918 is
   active a left turn of no more than 20 deg will be issued.
   A35.2.4. . Unless safety or mission requirements dictate otherwise, aircraft recovering from
   the east will fly a DDUNE recovery to avoid overflight of the towns of Valparaiso/Niceville.
   A35.2.5. Recoveries from the West will utilize the Whiskey Hotel Recovery, whenever
   possible.
   A35.2.6. Avoid populated areas on all low-level routes and plan departure/landing turns to
   minimize overflight of populated areas. Commensurate with safe flight operations and
   mission necessities, aircrew should use the minimum required power setting over populated
   areas.
   A35.2.7. Avoid uncontrolled airports by 1500 ft AGL or 2 NM laterally.
   A35.2.8. Populated areas will be avoided as much as possible when carrying external
   ordnance.
   A35.2.9. Aircrew are encouraged to fly at the highest practical altitude consistent with
   mission accomplishment in order to minimize the noise impact on the local community.
   Avoid overflying private homes and buildings to the maximum extent possible.
A35.3. Supersonic Procedures. Supersonic flight operations over the Eglin Land Range and
the Eglin Gulf Test and Training Range shall be conducted IAW AFI 13-201, Airspace
Management and the Eglin Supersonic Waiver 75-1.
   A35.3.1. Supersonic training may be accomplished over water above 10,000 ft MSL and at
   least 25 NM from the coast. Supersonic training profiles below 10,000 ft MSL will be flown
   a minimum of 25 NM from the coast if on a southerly heading, and a minimum of 50 NM
   from the coast if on a northerly heading.
   A35.3.2. Supersonic flight test profiles must be approved through the ATR/SB process and
   adhere to the following restrictions:
       A35.3.2.1. All overland profiles below FL300 shall be performed on Test Area B-70 and
       shall be restricted to a maximum over-pressure of 3.5 pounds per square foot (PSF) at a
       distance of 5 NM from the aircraft ground track. In no case will an over-pressure
       exceeding 3.5 PSF be allowed outside of the Eglin Land Range from the surface to
       FL300.
       A35.3.2.2. All overland profiles shall terminate in a level flight attitude so as not to
       expand the over-pressure envelope towards the ground.
       A35.3.2.3. Vehicular traffic on state roads and all personnel within the reservation shall
       be adequately protected from over-pressure exposure during scheduled runs.
EGLINAFBI11-201 1 MAY 2013                                                                   175


       A35.3.2.4. No supersonic missions over land shall be flown unless the test engineer has
       notified the Public Affairs Office (96 TW/PA) the day prior to the mission. The test
       engineer should again notify 96 TW/PA 1 hour prior to aircraft takeoff to confirm the
       mission status and update any changes. Aircrew shall confirm that this has been done
       before going to the aircraft.
       A35.3.2.5. Test teams shall make every effort to minimize dry supersonic passes
       overland.
       A35.3.2.6. Supersonic flight test profiles may be accomplished over water above 10,000
       ft MSL at least 25 NM from the coast. Supersonic flight test profiles below 10,000 ft
       MSL will be flown a minimum of 25 NM from the coast if on a southerly heading, and a
       minimum of 50 NM from the coast if on a northerly heading.
       A35.3.2.7. For supersonic flight test runs below 10,000 ft MSL, a boat check will be
       accomplished prior to commencing the test run to ensure there are no boats within 5 NM
       of the ground track.
A35.4. Ground Procedures. Aircraft engine ground run-ups up to 100 percent power for
maintenance purposes are authorized between 0600L-2300L. Exception: Engine run-ups
coinciding with actual flight operations are exempt from these restrictions and may be done on
the runway and/or taxiways leading up to the runway provided the aircraft is pointed in a safe
direction with respect to personnel, equipment and Foreign Object Debris (FOD).
   A35.4.1. Test Ramp: Engine run-ups at any power setting may be conducted in the sound
   suppresser test cell or Hush House. Run-ups up to 85 percent power on the Test Ramp are
   not restricted. Run-ups above 85 percent power outside the approved window in paragraph
   4.26. require approval from the 96 OG/CC or the 96 MXG/CC. Request approval through
   the Eglin Command Post.
   A35.4.2. 33rd RAMP: Engine run-ups are not restricted in the sound suppresser test cell.
   Outside the sound suppresser test cell, engine run ups above 80 percent during the night quiet
   hours (2301L- 0559L) require approval from the 33rd Maintenance Group Commander (33
   MXG/CC). Request approval through the Eglin Command Post.
   A35.4.3. C-130 Engine Maximum Power Run Areas: Idle speed engine runs are permitted
   anywhere C-130 aircraft are authorized to park or taxi.
A35.5. Exceptions. Mission constraints/requirements dictating exception to these procedures
will be reviewed and approved at the unit level. All other exceptions to the noise abatement
procedures will be reviewed for approval by the 96 OSS/CC.
