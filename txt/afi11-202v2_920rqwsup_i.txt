                UNIT STAN/EVAL FUNCTIONS AND ORGANIZATION

3.1. Scope. Units include levels of organization under HHQs required to establish a stan/eval
function for purposes of this instruction. Most units are composed of an Operations Group (OG)
and flying squadrons. Where there is no parent OG, squadrons/detachments will assume duties
listed for OGs, where applicable.
3.2. Operations Group. The conduct of the unit level stan/eval program is directed by the
OG/CC.
3.2. (920RQW) Operations Group. Specific 920 OG/OGV functions which have been
delegated to the squadron (SQ) stan/eval function are located in paragraph 3.3.2.9 and
subsequent paragraphs of this supplement.
   3.2.1. Operations Group Commander Responsibilities. Specific responsibilities of the
   OG/CC that relate to the stan/eval program:
       3.2.1.1. Establish and provide manpower to staff a stan/eval function to perform the
       duties directed by this instruction.
       3.2.1.2. Ensure materials provided for mission planning are accurate and current.
       3.2.1.3. Provide a suitable stan/eval testing area.
       3.2.1.4. Direct evaluations to maintain a quality aircrew force.
       3.2.1.5. Direct supplementary evaluations.
       3.2.1.6. Chair and determine the composition of the SEB.
   3.2.2. Operations Group Stan/Eval Functions. At the Operations Group stan/eval (OGV)
   level, emphasis is on unit standardization. Under direction of the Chief of OGV, flight
   examiners will ensure standardization among squadrons and squadron-assigned flight
   examiners. The OGV will:
   3.2.2. (920RQW) All Stan/Eval programs are maintained and administered from the 920
   OG/OGV. SQ Stan/Eval will implement delegated programs according to 920 OG/OGV
   directives. The 920 OG/OGV will use PEX as the Stan/Eval management tool to track
   evaluations, qualifications, certifications and generate documentation for Flight Evaluation
   Folder (FEF).
       3.2.2.1. Establish procedures for review and quality control of AF Forms 8, Certificate of
       Aircrew Qualification, and AF Forms 8a, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification (Multiple
       Aircraft).

     3.2.2.2. Establish procedures to maintain and review unit Flight Evaluation Folders
     (FEFs). Document these procedures in unit supplements to this instruction. Maintain unit
     FEFs, if applicable.
     3.2.2.2. (920RQW) FEFs are maintained at 920 OG/OGV. Accomplish FEF initial,
     posting, and periodic reviews on each individual aircrew member in accordance with
     (IAW) paragraphs 7.9.4.1.3, 7.9.4.2, and 7.9.4.3of this supplement.
     3.2.2.3. Establish procedures for the Aircrew Examination Program according to
     Chapter 6 and Chapter 8 of this instruction. Document Aircrew Examination Program
     in the unit supplement to this instruction.
     3.2.2.4. Establish and maintain a trend program.
        3.2.2.4.1. Scope will include trend analysis of all evaluations.
        3.2.2.4.1. (920RQW) The Trend Program will use PEX tracking of discrepancies
        and missed test questions to compile data for trend analysis.
            3.2.2.4.1.1. (Added-920RQW) A trend is a reoccurring deficiency requiring
            corrective action. Trends are established by the OG/CC at the SEB as the result
            of analysis of deficiencies. Objective analysis of deficiencies requires a
            meaningful quantity of data. A deficiency meets the threshold of a trend when: a
            question missed 20% of the time with a sample size greater than 5 attempts; or an
            evaluation area/sub area downgraded on 20% of administered evaluations.
            Meeting trend threshold alone is not the sole means of designating a deficiency as
            a trend. The OG/CC is the final authority for trend designation.
            3.2.2.4.1.2. (Added-920RQW) An observation is a reoccurring deficiency that
            approaches but does not meet the trend threshold. Examples of an observation are
            a question/area 10 to 19 percent of the time with a sample size greater then 5 or a
            question/area missed greater than 20 percent of the time with a sample size less
            than 5. Once an observation is established, OGV will:
                3.2.2.4.1.2.1. (Added-920RQW) Expand the data sample size by including
                the previous semiannual trend analysis cycle and determine if the reoccurring
                deficiency warrants inclusion of a trend without meeting the 20% threshold.
                3.2.2.4.1.2.2. (Added-920RQW) Include the observation in the SEB for
                discussion and potential corrective action. Corrective action for an
                observation is not mandatory.
        3.2.2.4.2. For units with more than one type of aircraft, combine discrepancies
        common to all aircraft/aircrews to determine trends (e.g., instrument procedures).
        3.2.2.4.3. For Formal Training Units (FTUs)/Combat Crew Training Squadrons
        (CCTSs), maintain separate trend data for students and qualified/instructor aircrews.
        3.2.2.4.4. When trends are noted, recommend corrective action and assign an
        OPR/Office of Collateral Responsibility (OCR); report trends and status to the
        OG/CC during the SEB until closed. OGV will publish and define the trend program
        in the unit supplement to this instruction and maintain trend data for at least one year.
            3.2.2.4.4.1. (Added-920RQW) Corrective actions for trends and observations
AFI11-202V2_920RQWSUP_I 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                   13


            are the same. OGV recommends and the OG/CC approves corrective actions.
            3.2.2.4.4.2. (Added-920RQW) Corrective actions include, but are not limited to:
            tailored periodic testing, Flight Engineer (FE) training emphasis, unit training
            assembly (UTA) aircrew briefing, and bulletin board slides with appropriate
            information. Effectiveness of corrective actions will be verified with control
            measures. Control measures include, but are not limited to: Supervisor (SUP)
            evals, on the spot (SPOT) evals, No-Notice evals, testing, and tape review.
            3.2.2.4.4.3. (Added-920RQW) Once a trend is identified, the OG/ CC with
            OGV will designate an appropriate POC and OPR for operating procedures to
            implement and report completion of each corrective action. The trend POC/OPR
            duties may include, but are not limited to:
                3.2.2.4.4.3.1. (Added-920RQW) Track and analyze all appropriate data
                3.2.2.4.4.3.2. (Added-920RQW) Recommend appropriate actions
                3.2.2.4.4.3.3. (Added-920RQW) Track corrective actions
                3.2.2.4.4.3.4. (Added-920RQW) Report findings
                3.2.2.4.4.3.5. (Added-920RQW) Keep a copy of all pertinent records
                electronically in the e-file located at S:\920_OG\920OG_OGV \18-OGV-
                Trend Analysis
     3.2.2.5. Conduct Supplementary Evaluations as directed.
        3.2.2.5.1. (Added-920RQW) The Supplementary evaluation program will be used
        to verify compliance with directives/procedures and to gather additional information
        for OG/CC use on any topic. SUP evals may encompass ground and/or flight events.
        The OG/CC will designate the OPR, objectives, scope, methodology and suspense of
        SUP evals. Upon completion of the SUP eval, the OPR will brief the OG/CC on the
        results. Written documentation will be IAW Attachment 2. All findings will be
        tracked in the SEB until closed.
     3.2.2.6. Conduct a SEB and publish minutes IAW the minimum outline of this
     instruction (Attachment 2) and guidance in the MAJCOM supplement to this instruction.
     3.2.2.7. Establish, monitor, and maintain quality control of the unit FCIF program.
     3.2.2.7. (920RQW) IAW AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, 920
     OG/CC designates the Chief of OGV as the primary OPR for the Flight Crew
     Information File (FCIF) Library. OGV will maintain a master FCIF Library. Each
     squadron will maintain an FCIF Library. To ensure the quality of the unit FCIF program,

                                        EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. The Aircrew Stan/Eval Program utilizes three types of evaluations to ensure
qualification of aircrew members and standardization of operations. Aircrew qualification
evaluations are administered periodically and documented on the AF Forms 8/8a to ensure
aircrew qualification. EPEs are requisites for some aircrew qualification evaluations.
Supplementary evaluations are unstructured tools to be used by the commander to ensure
standardization of flying and other operations.
5.2. Aircrew Qualification Evaluations. Aircrew qualification evaluations consist of two
structured phases, ground and flight. Each phase requires the completion of requisite tasks. The
ground phase, when required, includes a series of examinations and evaluation of aircrew
performance in a controlled emergency procedures environment. The flight phase includes an
inflight or, if applicable, simulator evaluation of aircrew performance. EXCEPTION: For
specialized aircrew qualified IAW Universal Qualification guidance see paragraph 5.2.18.
     5.2.1. Aircrew Qualification Evaluation Categories. There are five types of aircrew
     qualification evaluations. Periodic aircrew qualification evaluations are administered to
     ensure basic qualification in the MDS and crew position of an aircrew member (QUAL),
     qualification to operate in instrument meteorological conditions (INSTM, when applicable)
     and qualification to employ the MDS of the aircrew member in accomplishing the unit’s
     operational mission (MSN). Evaluations are accomplished to ensure aircrew are certified and
     maintain instructor qualification (INSTR). Evaluation and certification of specific aircrew
     performance may also be accomplished (SPOT). Aircrew will complete the following types
     of aircrew certification evaluations as appropriate:
        5.2.1.1. QUAL Evaluations. All aircrew will complete a periodic QUAL evaluation in
        their primary assigned aircraft, to include requisites, as specified in the applicable AFI
        11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2.
        5.2.1.2. INSTM Evaluations. All Air Force pilots (and other pilots flying operationally
        with the Air Force, e.g., exchange pilots) will maintain instrument qualification.
        EXCEPTION: Indoctrination flyers who fly under the provisions of AFI 11-401,
        Aviation Management; USAF Test Pilot School students; TG-series aircraft pilots;
        USAFA T-41 and T-51 pilots. Note: Pilots assigned to excepted aircraft who may also be
        assigned to other aircraft that are not excepted will maintain instrument qualification in
        non-excepted aircraft. To obtain/maintain instrument qualification, pilots must
        successfully complete a periodic INSTM evaluation.
            5.2.1.2.1. A commander may revoke the instrument qualification of any pilot under
            his/her command who fails to maintain minimum instrument flying skills. To revoke
            an instrument qualification for reasons not related to an evaluation, use the
            procedures in Chapter 7 for a commander-directed downgrade.
            5.2.1.2.2. A pilot with a revoked or expired instrument qualification may not fly as a
            pilot in aircraft in which instrument qualification is required except in a training
            program leading to requalification. Pilots in this situation must be in supervised
            status. (Does not apply to pilots in excepted situations listed in paragraph 5.2.1.2)
AFI11-202V2_920RQWSUP_I 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                       23


     5.2.1.3. MSN Evaluations. All aircrew members maintaining MR/CMR or BMC
     aircrew status will complete a periodic MSN evaluation in their primary assigned aircraft,
     to include requisites, as specified in the applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2.
     The MSN evaluation should reflect the type and difficulty of tasks required in the
     performance of normal operational and training sorties. The requirement for a MSN
     evaluation may be waived for those aircraft where performance of normal operational,
     test and training sorties involves tasks covered during the accomplishment of an INSTM
     and/or QUAL evaluation as specified in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2. QUAL and
     MSN evaluations may be combined into a single evaluation as specified in AFI 11-2
     MDS-Specific Volumes 2.
     5.2.1.4. INSTR Evaluations. Aircrew members maintaining instructor qualification in a
     particular MDS aircraft must complete initial and periodic evaluations of instructional
     capability in that MDS aircraft. Specialized qualified, universally qualified, or multiple
     qualified aircrew maintaining instructor qualification in multiple similar aircraft will
     accomplish initial and periodic evaluations as specified in MAJCOM Supplements and/or
     AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2.
        5.2.1.4.1. To initially qualify as an instructor in a particular MDS aircraft, the aircrew
        member must successfully complete an initial instructor (INIT INSTR) evaluation.
        Accomplish INIT INSTR evaluations on actual instructional missions whenever
        possible. When students are not available or mission requirements/crew composition
        requirements prevent inclusion of students, another crewmember or the evaluator may
        serve as the student for the purpose of evaluating the examinee’s instructional ability.
        5.2.1.4.2. Periodic evaluation of the ability of aircrew members to instruct will be
        conducted during all subsequent periodic evaluations. The AF Form 8/8a
        Mission/Check description for these periodic evaluations will not include INSTR as
        the AF Form 8/8a aircraft/crew position is already annotated with highest
        qualification demonstrated during the previous evaluation (e.g. IB, IN, IP).
        5.2.1.4.3. If instructor qualification is lost in an MDS aircraft, it may be regained
        through an instructor requalification evaluation (see paragraphs 5.2.3.2.2 and
        5.2.3.2.4) as directed in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 1.
     5.2.1.5. SPOT Evaluations –Flight or Ground (Optional). A SPOT evaluation is an
     evaluation not intended to satisfy the requirements of a periodic evaluation (e.g., INSTM,
     QUAL, MSN or INSTR). SPOT evaluations have no specific requisites or requirements,
     unless specified in MAJCOM supplements. An evaluation that begins as a SPOT
     evaluation may become (and be documented as) a required periodic evaluation if all
     required flight phase requirements are completed during the SPOT eval and the examinee
     subsequently completes all ground phase requirements for the evaluation within the
     periods described in paragraph 5.2.7 Do not add on missions (flights) to complete the
     requirements for a periodic evaluation unless the group/squadron commander concurs
     with the aircrew member’s desire to realign the evaluation expiration date and approves
     the additional flight time requirements. Evaluations not listed in paragraphs 5.2.1.1
     5.2.1.4 will be documented as SPOT evaluations. Note: When the flight examiner
     administering a SPOT evaluation is not qualified in the MDS and same crew position of
     the examinee, the evaluation will not be credited towards a periodic evaluation.
24                                        AFI11-202V2_920RQWSUP_I 24 FEBRUARY 2010


     5.2.2. Combined Aircrew Qualification Evaluations. To promote efficient use of flying
     resources, accomplish evaluations concurrently, whenever practical. If combined, include the
     designation of each evaluation in the Flight Phase of the AF Form 8, e.g., QUAL/MSN or
     INSTM/QUAL/MSN. Evaluations in multiple crew positions will be addressed in MAJCOM
     supplements.
     5.2.3. Aircrew Qualification Evaluation Prefixes. The following prefixes will be used,
     when applicable, to further describe the evaluations listed in paragraphs 5.2.1.1 - 5.2.1.5:
        5.2.3.1. Initial (INIT). The first evaluation of any type for a crew position or instructor
        qualification in an MDS (e.g., INIT QUAL/INSTM, INIT MSN, INIT INSTR).
        5.2.3.2. Requalification (RQ). An evaluation administered to remedy a loss of
        qualification due to expiration of a required periodic evaluation, loss of currency, a flight
        recheck following a failed periodic evaluation (see paragraph 7.3.9 for ground
        rechecks), or loss of qualification due to a commander-directed downgrade.
            5.2.3.2.1. When loss of qualification is for expiration of a required periodic
            evaluation, the evaluation given will be IAW the guidance for that periodic
            evaluation. The AF Form 8/8a Mission/Check description will be documented with an
            RQ prefix. Note: When expiration of a required periodic evaluation is due to failure
            to complete one or more of the ground phase requisites (see paragraph 5.2.4), the
            flight evaluation has successfully been completed within the eligibility period for an
            in-the-eligibility period evaluation or within the period listed in paragraph 5.2.7.2
            for an out-of-the-eligibility period evaluation, and the OG/CC determines that
            qualification will be re-established by completion of the ground requisites without re-
            accomplishment of the flight evaluation or completed ground requisites as outlined in
            paragraph 5.2.16, the AF Form 8/8a Mission/Check description will not be
            documented with an RQ prefix.
            5.2.3.2.2. When loss of qualification is due to loss of currency, the evaluation profile
            will be as directed by the squadron commander and will include, as a minimum, those
            items for which the individual is non-current. The AF Form 8/8a Mission/Check
            description will be documented with RQ SPOT. See also AFI 11-202, Volume 1,
            Aircrew Training, for policy regarding loss of currency.
            5.2.3.2.3. When loss of qualification is for failure to pass a flight evaluation, the
            recheck evaluation will be IAW the provisions of paragraph 5.2.13 The AF Form
            8/8a Mission/Check description will be documented with an RQ prefix or RQ SPOT,
            as applicable.
            5.2.3.2.4. When loss of qualification is due to a commander-directed downgrade (see
            paragraph 7.4.8), the evaluation profile will be as directed by the commander. The
            AF Form 8/8a Mission/Check description will be documented with an RQ prefix or
            RQ SPOT, as applicable.
            5.2.3.2.5. Do not use RQ to prefix a recheck following a failed INIT evaluation. No
            qualification was achieved, thus requalification is not possible.
            5.2.3.2.6. When requalification deals with instructor capability, the AF Form 8/8a
            Mission/Check description will be documented with RQ INSTR (not RQ SPOT).
AFI11-202V2_920RQWSUP_I 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                        25


     5.2.3.3. No-Notice (N/N). A no-notice evaluation is one where the examinee is notified
     of the evaluation at or after the beginning of normal preparation for the mission. The
     beginning of normal preparation for a mission will be determined by the flight examiner
     and may be defined in supplements to this instruction. The intent is to preclude
     extraordinary preparation for the mission.
         5.2.3.3.1. The no-notice evaluation program provides commanders a sampling of
         daily aircrew performance and an assessment of unit training effectiveness.
         5.2.3.3.2. An examinee may utilize a no-notice evaluation to update a
         QUAL/INSTM/MSN evaluation expiration date provided all requirements for the
         evaluation are completed within the periods described in paragraph 5.2.7. If all
         requirements were not completed on the first flight, subsequent flights are authorized
         to complete required events. If the examinee elects not to update a
         QUAL/INSTM/MSN evaluation expiration date, the evaluation will be documented
         as a N/N SPOT evaluation.
     5.2.3.4. Simulator (SIM). An evaluation where the flight phase requisite is conducted
     in a simulator.
     5.2.3.5. Multiple Prefixes. More than one prefix may be used to describe an evaluation
     (e.g., N/N SIM SPOT). The applicability of any prefixes to portions of any combined
     evaluations and the purpose for any prefixes will be explained under Mission Description
     in the Examiner’s Remarks (see paragraphs 7.3.7.3 and 7.4.7.3).
  5.2.4. Ground Phase Requisites. The ground phase for periodic aircrew evaluations
  includes requisites listed below. See Chapter 6 of this instruction for additional guidance on
  aircrew examinations.
     5.2.4.1. QUAL Evaluations. Open book examination, closed book examination,
     Boldface/Critical Action Procedures (CAPs) examination / EPE (if applicable).
     5.2.4.2. INSTM Evaluations. Instrument examination.
     5.2.4.3. MSN Evaluations. As specified in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2.
  5.2.5. Flight Phase Requisites. The flight phase for aircrew evaluations include execution
  in the MDS or, if applicable, a suitable simulator profile that will allow evaluation of aircrew
  performance. The profile used to fulfill the flight phase requisite must incorporate all
  appropriate requirements set in the applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2, and allow
  accurate measure of the proficiency of the examinee. Evaluation profiles will reflect unit
  tasking, daily training missions, be realistic, and incorporate current tactics applicable to the
  unit mission.
  5.2.6. Timing of Aircrew Qualification Evaluations.
     5.2.6.1. Expiration Date. Required periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the
     17th month following the month in which the flight phase was successfully flown (e.g. a
     periodic evaluation in which the flight phase was completed on 9 Oct 04 expires on 31
     Mar 06.).
     5.2.6.2. Scheduling. Schedule periodic evaluations in the eligibility period (six-month
     period prior to expiration date).
26                                   AFI11-202V2_920RQWSUP_I 24 FEBRUARY 2010


     5.2.6.3. Extended Evaluations. Periodic evaluations may be extended on a case-by-
     case basis according to the following criteria:
        5.2.6.3.1. Squadron Commander-Extended Evaluations. Squadron commanders
        may extend the expiration date of periodic evaluations up to three months for the
        reasons listed below.
           5.2.6.3.1.1. Individuals assigned PCS/PCA to a non-flying assignment.
           5.2.6.3.1.2. Individuals departing PCS or TDY for retraining in another aircraft
           type.
           5.2.6.3.1.3. Individuals undergoing unit aircraft conversion.
           5.2.6.3.1.4. Individual removal from active flying status (e.g. separation or
           retirement from the Service).
           5.2.6.3.1.5. Individuals participating in real world operations (to include
           operations other than war, alert, etc.) who are not able to complete the required
           flight evaluation(s) before or during deployment. This will be on a case-by-case
           basis and is not authority to grant blanket extensions for scheduled operational
           deployments.
        5.2.6.3.2. For squadron commanders and above, the approval authority is the next
        commander in the member’s flying chain of command, with the concurrence of the
        member’s immediate supervisor, IAW the guidance provided in paragraph 5.2.6.3.1
        For individuals not assigned to a MAJCOM, AF/A3O-A is the approval authority.
        5.2.6.3.3. HHQ-Extended Evaluations. HQ USAF/A3O-A may authorize the
        extension of expiration dates of periodic aircrew qualification evaluations.
        5.2.6.3.4. Documentation. Document extensions with a memorandum for record
        (MFR) placed in Section II of the FEF specifying extension authority, the new
        expiration date, and include a brief description of the extension.
           5.2.6.3.4.1. Extension MFRs will be dated prior to the expiration date of any
           affected periodic evaluation.
           5.2.6.3.4.2. File the MFR on top of the affected AF Form 8/8a in Section II of the
           FEF.
           5.2.6.3.4.3. Requisites not completed during original eligibility period must be
           completed prior to extended expiration date indicated on the MFR.
           5.2.6.3.4.4. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the affected
           AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks, paragraph D, Additional Comments,
           when action is complete and remove the MFR from the FEF. Memos for record
           become a permanent part of the FEF only when the Major discrepancy addressed
           by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by a later Form 8/8a. Example: If an
           evaluation was extended based on an HHQ waiver, an MFR will remain in the
           FEF until such time as the next evaluation is completed. That waiver reference is
           commented on in para D of the Form 8/8a.
AFI11-202V2_920RQWSUP_I 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                    27


     5.2.6.4. Requirements Before Permanent Change of Station/Temporary Duty. If a
     periodic evaluation will expire within three months after the proposed departure for a
     Permanent Change of Station (PCS) to a flying assignment in the same aircraft MDS, or
     during an upcoming Temporary Duty (TDY) (flying or non-flying), complete the
     required evaluation(s) before departing for either the PCS flying assignment or the TDY.
     Obtain a MAJCOM stan/eval waiver for unusual situations.
  5.2.7. Requisite Completion. One set of requisites may be used to satisfy the requirements
  of combined evaluations as defined in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2. Requisites from a
  completed evaluation may be used for subsequent evaluations provided they cover all
  required areas and are within the requisite zone for each evaluation. See also paragraph
  5.3.1. For aircrew possessing multiple instrument qualifications, the instrument exam may
  count for separate evaluations provided the instrument exam occurs for each evaluation IAW
  the provisions of paragraphs 5.2.7.1and 5.2.7.2 For all evaluations, accomplish requisites as
  follows:
     5.2.7.1. In-the-Eligibility Period. For scheduled or no-notice periodic evaluations in
     the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within the six-month eligibility
     period prior to the expiration date of the current evaluation period to update that
     expiration date.
     5.2.7.2. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. For periodic evaluations outside the eligibility
     period, all requisites must be completed within a six-month period encompassing the
     month in which the flight evaluation was administered. EXCEPTION: For extended
     evaluations, requisites may be completed between the beginning of the six-month
     eligibility period prior to the original expiration date and the extended expiration date.
     5.2.7.3. Recheck. For evaluations used to remedy a failed evaluation:
         5.2.7.3.1. Requisites that were valid for a failed evaluation per paragraph 5.2.7.1 or
         5.2.7.2 remain valid, IAW paragraph 5.2.13.1
         5.2.7.3.2. Valid requisite completion dates from the Q-3 AF Form 8/8a will not be
         annotated on the recheck AF Form 8/8a. The recheck AF Form 8/8a will only include
         documentation of the flight phase evaluation, unless requisites were not completed or
         are required to complete the recheck. If the flight recheck is completed prior to
         completion of required requisites, delay completion of the AF Form 8/8a until
         requisites are complete and enter the requisites on the recheck AF Form 8/8a.
  5.2.8. Alternate Means of Evaluation. When in-flight evaluation of a required area is not
  possible, the area may be evaluated verbally or in an Aircrew Training Device (ATD). Flight
  examiners will make every effort to evaluate all required areas in-flight before resorting to
  this option. See the appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2, for areas prohibited from
  verbal/ATD evaluation.
  5.2.9. Evaluation Criteria Source. The MAJCOM designated as lead command in AFPD
  10-9, in coordination with other user commands, will establish and maintain standardized
  INSTM, INSTR, MSN and QUAL evaluation criteria in the appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS-
  Specific Volume 2. The lead command is responsible for coordinating the establishment of:
28                                        AFI11-202V2_920RQWSUP_I 24 FEBRUARY 2010


        5.2.9.1. Areas/subareas to be used for documenting required evaluations including those
        required and critical for evaluation completion. These areas/subareas will be arranged
        into general and specific evaluation areas. Where required, mission areas/subareas will be
        further subdivided into general and specific mission areas.
        5.2.9.2. An area containing criteria for Publications Check. This is required for QUAL
        evaluations and may be accomplished on other evaluations.
            5.2.9.2.1. Each aircrew member is responsible for required flight publications as
            outlined in applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific series publications.
            5.2.9.2.2. Satisfactory performance requires individual flight publications be current
            and properly posted. In units that do not issue individual aircrew publications, aircrew
            members are still responsible for the accuracy and currency of all publications
            required for the mission.
        5.2.9.3. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM) evaluation criteria in the
        appropriate areas/subareas. Use AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management
        Training Program, and MAJCOM supplements (as applicable).
        5.2.9.4. Criteria to ensure operations comply with National Airspace System (NAS) rules
        and procedures. Must specifically ensure compliance with minimum safe maneuvering
        speeds below 10,000 ft MSL and NAS awareness in all areas of mission planning and
        flight operations.
     5.2.10. Grading System. A two-tiered grading system is used to evaluate and document
     aircrew performance. On one level, individual scores are recorded for examinations while
     areas/subareas of aircrew performance are individually graded against established evaluation
     criteria. Performance less than fully qualified is documented. On the second level, an overall
     qualification level is determined from the compilation of these individual scores/grades.
        5.2.10.1. Area/Subarea Grades. AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2 will establish
        areas and subareas to be evaluated during emergency procedure and other evaluations - to
        include the appropriate grading criteria for those areas/subareas. Areas/subareas will have
        a two-level (Q/U) or three-level (Q/Q-/U) grading system. Discrepancies will be
        documented against the listed subareas.
            5.2.10.1.1. Q is the desired level of performance. The examinee demonstrated a
            satisfactory knowledge of all required information, performed aircrew duties within
            the prescribed tolerances, and accomplished the assigned mission.
            5.2.10.1.2. Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned
            area/subarea tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the
            flight examiner. Deviations from established standards must not exceed the
            prescribed Q- tolerances or jeopardize flight safety.
            5.2.10.1.3. U indicates a breach of flight discipline, performance outside allowable
            parameters or deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances that adversely
            affected mission accomplishment or compromised flight safety. An examinee
            receiving an area/subarea grade of U normally requires additional training. When, in
            the judgment of the flight examiner, additional training will not constructively
AFI11-202V2_920RQWSUP_I 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                      29


         improve examinee’s performance, it is not required. In this case, the flight examiner
         must thoroughly debrief the examinee.
     5.2.10.2. Critical Area. The lead MAJCOM is responsible for the establishment of
     evaluation areas that, upon failure, would most adversely affect the qualification of an
     aircrew member. Critical areas include, but are not limited to, Airmanship, Flight
     Discipline and Safety. Grade all critical areas as either Qualified (Q) or Unqualified (U).
     5.2.10.3. Qualification Levels. EPEs and overall evaluation performance are graded by
     qualification levels as follows:
         5.2.10.3.1. Qualification Level 1 (Q-1). The aircrew member demonstrated desired
         performance and knowledge of procedures, equipment and directives within
         tolerances specified in the grading criteria. This will be awarded when no
         discrepancies were noted, and may be awarded when discrepancies are noted if:
            5.2.10.3.1.1. The discrepancies resulted in no U grades being given in any
            area(s)/subarea(s).
            5.2.10.3.1.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, none of the discrepancies
            preclude awarding of an overall Qualification Level 1.
            5.2.10.3.1.3. All discrepancies noted during the evaluation were cleared during
            the debrief of that evaluation.
         5.2.10.3.2. Qualification Level 2 (Q-2). The aircrew member demonstrated the
         ability to perform duties safely, but:
            5.2.10.3.2.1. There were one or more area(s)/subarea(s) where additional training
            was assigned.
            5.2.10.3.2.2. A non-critical area/subarea grade of U was awarded.
            5.2.10.3.2.3. In the judgment of the flight examiner, there is justification based on
            performance in one or several areas/subareas.
         5.2.10.3.3. Qualification Level 3 (Q-3). The aircrew member demonstrated an
         unacceptable level of safety, performance or knowledge.
            5.2.10.3.3.1. An area grade of U awarded in a critical area requires an overall Q-3
            for the evaluation.
            5.2.10.3.3.2. An overall Q-3 can be awarded if, in the judgment of the flight
            examiner, there is justification based on performance in one or several
            areas/subareas.
     5.2.10.4. Boldface/CAPs. Grade Boldface/CAPs examinations as either Qualified (Q)
     or Unqualified (U).
     5.2.10.5. Written, Computer Based, or Electronic Examinations. Grade written,
     computer based, or electronic examinations as a percentage of correct answers. See
     paragraph 6.4.4.1 for minimum passing grade criteria.
  5.2.11. Grading Policies.
30                                   AFI11-202V2_920RQWSUP_I 24 FEBRUARY 2010


     5.2.11.1. Requisite Examinations. The flight examiner will consider performance on
     requisite examinations in assigning the overall qualification level.
     5.2.11.2. Performance Areas/Subareas. Use the two-level (Q/U) or three-level (Q/Q-
     /U) grading system when applying the grading criteria definitions specified in the
     applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2, to grade areas/subareas.
        5.2.11.2.1. The flight examiner must grade the areas/subareas listed as ―required‖ in
        the general and specific evaluation sections of the applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific
        Volume 2.
        5.2.11.2.2. The flight examiner will grade any area/subarea observed during an
        evaluation if performance in that area/subarea impacts the specific evaluation
        accomplished or flight safety.
        5.2.11.2.3. Grading criteria tolerances assume smooth air and stable aircraft
        conditions.
        5.2.11.2.4. Minor momentary deviations from grading criteria tolerances are
        acceptable, provided the examinee applies prompt corrective action and such
        deviations do not jeopardize flight safety. Consider cumulative deviations when
        determining the overall area/subarea grade.
        5.2.11.2.5. The flight examiner may further identify an area/sub-area as
        ―Commendable‖ if, in the examiner’s determination, the aircrew member has
        demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in that particular area/sub-area.
        Document commendable areas in the examiner’s remarks section of the AF Form
        8/8a.
     5.2.11.3. Overall Qualification Levels.
        5.2.11.3.1. The overall qualification level awarded on an evaluation is based on
        performance during both the flight and ground phases. An overall grade of Q-1 or Q-
        2 will be awarded only after all evaluation requirements have been completed and
        given due consideration. An overall grade of Q-3 may be awarded at any time.
        5.2.11.3.2. To receive a qualified grade on an evaluation, the aircrew member must
        satisfy the criteria set forth in the applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2, and
        demonstrate ability to operate the aircraft and/or equipment safely and effectively
        during all phases of an evaluation.
        5.2.11.3.3. Overall qualification grades will be a cumulative process. While AFI 11-2
        MDS Specific Volume 2 guidance may dictate the highest grade for a flight or EPE
        based on area and subarea performance, flight examiner judgment will always be the
        determining factor in deciding the overall qualification level.
     5.2.11.4. Exceptionally Qualified Designation. An exceptionally qualified designation
     may be awarded by the flight examiner. The designation can only be applied to the total
     evaluation - not to separate requisites. The designation may be awarded when:
        5.2.11.4.1. The aircrew member has demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in
        all phases of the evaluation;
        5.2.11.4.2. The aircrew member has not failed any requisite and;
AFI11-202V2_920RQWSUP_I 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                   31


         5.2.11.4.3. The aircrew member received a qualified grade with no remedial action
         on all areas/subareas evaluated during emergency procedures and flight evaluations.
  5.2.12. Remedial Action. All grades of Q- or less require action to remedy the discrepancy
  and/or deficiency in performance. Remedial action includes debriefing discrepancies and/or
  assignment of additional training. See paragraph 5.2.13 when discrepancies result in failure
  to pass a flight evaluation.
     5.2.12.1. Debriefed Discrepancy. Remedial action accomplished during debrief of the
     evaluation wherein the flight examiner provides briefing/instruction concerning the
     discrepancy and determines that the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or
     proficiency to remedy the discrepancy. The discrepancy area/subarea description is
     annotated with ―Debriefed‖ in paragraph B of the Examiner’s Remarks section of the AF
     Form 8/8a Comments.
     5.2.12.2. Additional Training. Any training recommended by a flight examiner to
     remedy deficiencies identified during an evaluation.
     5.2.12.2. (920RQW) The FE will determine required additional training and/or
     restrictions and will communicate to the appropriate operations supervision IAW AFI 11-
     202v2, ACCSup1, Paragraphs 4.3.6.and 4.3.7.          OGV will place the individual in
     supervised/restricted status in PEX with the required additional training. OGV will brief
     the operations supervision on the requirements to complete the assigned additional
     training and complete the evaluation. The squadron DO/CC is responsible for ensuring
     completion of requirements, and will monitor PEX to track completion of assigned
     additional training by the due date.
         5.2.12.2.1. Additional training may include self-study, ground instruction, use of a
         simulator or flying. To complete additional training, the examinee must demonstrate
         attainment of satisfactory knowledge or proficiency.
         5.2.12.2.2. Additional training is documented in paragraph C, Recommended
         Additional Training, under Examiner’s Remarks in the AF Form 8/8a Comments
         section. Description of assigned additional training will include how satisfactory
         knowledge or proficiency will be demonstrated to a flight examiner or instructor.
         5.2.12.2.3. Due dates and dates on which additional training is completed will be
         documented in the appropriate areas of the AF Form 8/8a (see paragraphs 7.3.5.5
         and 7.4.5.5).
         5.2.12.2.4. The flight examiner or instructor who completed the additional training
         will sign as the Certifying Official under Additional Training, Section II, verifying
         completion of all assigned training as documented in paragraph C, Recommended
         Additional Training, under Examiner’s Remarks.
         5.2.12.2.5. Commanders will ensure required additional training is completed.
         Accomplish additional training by the last day of the third month following the date
         of the discrepancy, e.g., for an evaluation on 21 Jan 06, additional training must be
         accomplished by 30 Apr 06. If an aircrew member exceeds the allotted time for
         completion of additional training, the squadron commander will review the situation
         and direct appropriate action. Document the circumstances with an MFR placed in
32                                        AFI11-202V2_920RQWSUP_I 24 FEBRUARY 2010


            Section II of the FEF of the affected individual. Incorporate the information contained
            in the MFR onto the affected AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks, paragraph D,
            Additional Comments, when action is complete, and remove the MFRs from the FEF.
            Memos for record become a permanent part of the FEF only when the Major
            discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by a later Form 8/8a.
     5.2.13. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation.
        5.2.13.1. Recheck. If an aircrew member fails a flight evaluation, a successful flight or
        ground recheck must be completed by the end of the third month after the date of the first
        failure, e.g. for an evaluation on 20 Jun 07, complete the recheck by 30 Sep 07. A
        recheck is successfully completed when the aircrew member performs to Q criteria (Q or
        Q-/debriefed) for each area graded U. OG/CCs may approve waivers to the time limits in
        this paragraph on a case-by-case basis. Document such action with an MFR placed in
        Section II of the FEF. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the
        affected AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks, paragraph D, Additional Comments,
        when action is complete, and remove the MFR from the FEF. Memos for record become
        a permanent part of the FEF only when the Major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is
        not addressed or corrected by a later Form 8/8a. Every reasonable effort must be made to
        requalify the individual. Commanders will determine the number of flights to be allowed
        during this period, based on the individual’s experience level, present qualifications and
        hours of training required. The flight examiner that administered the original check will
        not normally administer the recheck.
        5.2.13.2. Status Downgrade. Downgrade aircrew members receiving a Q-3 INSTM,
        QUAL or MSN evaluation to non-mission ready (NMR)/non-combat mission ready (N-
        CMR), non-basic mission capable (N-BMC), or non-basic aircraft qualified (N-BAQ)
        status, as applicable. For instructor evaluations, aircrew status (i.e., MR/CMR or BMC)
        need not be downgraded if the discrepancies were only in instructor areas.
     5.2.14. Restrictions. When called for by this instruction or deemed necessary in the
     judgment of the flight examiner, flight restrictions will be imposed on the examinee until
     successful completion of assigned additional training and/or a recheck.
        5.2.14.1. Restrictions should address the specific phase of flight and/or operation that
        requires supervision and the criteria for removal of the restrictions.
            5.2.14.1.1. Substandard performance in any area/subarea may require restrictions to
            ensure operational safety or mission accomplishment.
            5.2.14.1.2. If defined in the MDS specific Volume 1 and/or Volume 2 , formal
            schoolhouses will include restrictions on the AF Forms 8 for any core item not
            accomplished due to training limimitations, regardless if the method of qualification
            is by evaluation or instructor certification. Under no circumstance will aircrew
            perform core items in which they are not qualified unless under the direct supervision
            of an instructor. In this case, MDS specific guidance will set the time requirement for
            completion of additional training.
        5.2.14.2. Specific restrictions and the criteria for the removal of the restrictions will be
        documented as the first item of the AF Form 8/8a Comments. Restrictions associated
        with failed requisite examinations will not be documented on the AF Form 8/8a.
AFI11-202V2_920RQWSUP_I 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                     33


     5.2.14.3. Restrict aircrew receiving a Q-3 on an evaluation until a successful evaluation
     is completed:
         5.2.14.3.1. For QUAL evaluations, place the examinee on supervised status in the
         aircraft in which the evaluation was administered, unless, in the opinion of the
         evaluator, the discrepancy is applicable to additional aircraft. For specialized
         qualified, universally qualified, or multiple qualified aircrew maintaining
         qualification for similar duty in multiple aircraft, AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2
         may direct supervised status in all aircraft in which the individual maintains
         qualification.
         5.2.14.3.2. For INSTM evaluations, restrictions apply to all aircraft in which the
         examinee is required to maintain instrument qualification.
         5.2.14.3.3. MSN       Evaluation.    The      examinee      may      perform    basic
         qualification/instrument tasks unless specifically restricted. Place the examinee on
         supervised status for mission tasks.
         5.2.14.3.4. INSTR Evaluation. Instructors receiving an unsatisfactory grade in any
         instructor area(s) will not perform instructor duties until a successful recheck is
         completed.
  5.2.15. Supervised Status. If unsatisfactory performance or restriction requires the aircrew
  member be placed on supervised status, the type of supervisor (i.e., instructor or designated
  supervisor) will be determined by the squadron commander (or equivalent) and as specified
  in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 1. Supervision will be accomplished by instructors or
  designated supervisors (as specified in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 1) qualified in the
  specific aircrew position.
  5.2.16. Failure to Complete an Evaluation within the Required Period. If an aircrew
  member fails to complete an evaluation (either ground phase or flight phase) within the
  eligibility period for an in-the-eligibility period evaluation or within the period listed in
  paragraph 5.2.7.2 for an out-of-the-eligibility period evaluation, the aircrew member loses
  the qualification covered by the evaluation and the restrictions of paragraph 5.2.14.3 apply.
  Qualification may be re-established by administering a requalification evaluation (see
  paragraph 5.2.3.2) or by completion of the delinquent evaluation. OG/CCs may approve
  waivers to preclude the re-accomplishment of completed requisites to complete the
  evaluation on a case-by-case basis. Document such action with an MFR placed in Section II
  of the FEF. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the affected AF Form
  8/8a under Examiner Remarks, paragraph D, Additional Comments, when action is complete,
  and remove the MFR from the FEF. Memos for record become a permanent part of the FEF
  only when the Major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by a
  later Form 8/8a.
  5.2.17. Multiple Qualification. Multiple qualification guidance applies to aircrew members
  who maintain qualification in two or more mission design series aircraft. When differences
  between series aircraft in the same MDS are great enough, the lead MAJCOM, in
  coordination with using MAJCOMs, will identify requirements for separate qualification
  requirements. When separate qualification is not required, document certification in different
  MDS series using AF Form 1381, USAF Certification of Air Crew Training, or AF Form
34                                         AFI11-202V2_920RQWSUP_I 24 FEBRUARY 2010


     4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications. MAJCOMs may approve use of a unit certification
     document signed by an authorized official (such as a Letter of X’s).
        5.2.17.1. Documentation. Document MAJCOM authority for multiple qualification,
        including a list of aircraft in which qualification will be maintained, in an MFR placed in
        Section II of the FEF. (For Air Force Materiel Command [AFMC], MAJCOM authority
        may be delegated, but not lower than wing commander.) See AFI 11-202, Volume 1, for
        additional guidance.
        5.2.17.2. Instrument Evaluation. Pilots need only complete an INSTM evaluation, to
        include requisites, in one of the aircraft in which they maintain qualification as specified
        by the authorizing MAJCOM unless additional INSTM evaluation requirements are
        directed by the MAJCOM in its supplement to this instruction.
        5.2.17.3. Qualification and Mission Evaluations. All aircrew require a QUAL
        evaluation, and, if applicable, a MSN evaluation, to include requisites, in each mission
        design series aircraft according to applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2. When
        specified IAW paragraph 5.2.17, QUAL and MSN evaluations are required for different
        series aircraft in the same MDS.
        5.2.17.4. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation. A Q-3 on an INSTM evaluation results
        in a downgrade in all aircraft flown in which instrument qualification is required. A
        downgrade resulting from a Q-3 in QUAL or MSN evaluation applies only to the aircraft
        for which the evaluation was administered, unless, in the opinion of the evaluator, the
        discrepancy is applicable to additional aircraft.
     5.2.18. Universal Qualification. Universal qualification guidance applies to specialized
     aircrew who maintain qualification in two or more mission design series aircraft where
     qualification is attained/maintained via a minimum of a ground phase examination.
     MAJCOMs may require a flight phase evaluation. AE crewmembers require a ground and
     flight phase evaluation, IAW AFI 11-2AE, Volume 2. The flight phase evaluation, when
     required, may be accomplished on any of the aircraft in which the aircrew member is either
     gaining or maintaining qualification, and will update qualification on all aircraft listed on the
     specialized aircrew member’s Aeronautical Order (AO). MAJCOMs may specify additional
     ground phase requisites.
        5.2.18.1. Applicability. Specialized aircrew may gain/maintain aircraft qualification
        IAW Universal Qualification guidance. MAJCOMs will identify Universal Qualified
        crewmember eligibility in the MAJCOM supplement to this AFI.
        5.2.18.2. Documentation. Specialized aircrew qualifications maintained under
        Universal qualification guidance will be documented on an AF Form 8a, IAW paragraph
        7.4. AECM qualification will be documented using AF Form 8, IAW paragraph 7.3.
        Flight surgeon qualification may be documented using either AF Form 8 or AF Form 8a,
        IAW paragraph 8.2.8 or paragraph 8.2.9
        5.2.18.3. Qualification and Mission Evaluations. All aircrew qualifications
        maintained under Universal Qualification guidance are considered a QUAL evaluation. A
        MSN evaluation may be directed by applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2
        and/or MAJCOM supplement to this Instruction. MSN evaluations, when required, will
AFI11-202V2_920RQWSUP_I 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                     35


      include a flight phase evaluation in one MDS that the Specialized Aircrew member
      maintains qualification.
      5.2.18.4. Failure to Pass a Requisite/Flight Evaluation. Failure of universally
      qualified aircrew members to pass a ground requisite or flight phase evaluation results in
      loss of applicable aircraft qualification, IAW MAJCOM supplement and AFI 11-2 MDS-
      Specific Volumes 2.
   5.2.19. Aircrews Flying in Non-US Air Force Aircraft and with Non-US Air Force
   Units. Aircrew members authorized to perform duties in non-US Air Force aircraft IAW
   AFI 11-401, or on duty with or attached to non-US Air Force units for flying, abide by host
   service or host country guidance, except for the requirement to maintain a current physical
   and review their flight records according to AFI 11-202, Volume 1. They do not necessarily
   abide by USAF guidance, including AFI 11-202, Volume 2, and AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific
   Volume 2. Therefore, when they return to USAF units, they must complete applicable
   requisites and be evaluated for any periodic USAF evaluations that expired during their tour.
   The restrictions in paragraph 5.2.14 of this instruction apply to such individuals until
   successful evaluations are completed.
      NOTES:
      1. MAJCOMs may approve exceptions to requirements for returning aircrew members to
         complete applicable requisites and expired USAF evaluations, if, after case-by-case
         review, they determine non-USAF evaluations are equivalent to applicable AFI 11-2
         MDS-Specific Volume 2 evaluations. Document such action with an MFR placed in
         Section II of the FEF on top of the non-USAF AF Form 8 equivalent.
      2. Air Force units that use non-US Air Force aircraft to execute an Air Force flying
         program will comply with current Air Force guidance, unless excepted by proper
         authority. See AFI 11-401 for definitions of Air Force and US Government aircraft.
5.3. Emergency Procedures Evaluations.
   5.3.1. Scope. Evaluate an aircrew member’s knowledge of MDS-Specific EPs and systems
   knowledge for all QUAL evaluations; evaluate MSN specific emergency procedures and
   systems knowledge during MSN evaluations. Only one EPE needs to be accomplished for
   each combined evaluation (i.e., one EPE for a QUAL/MSN or INSTM/QUAL/MSN
   evaluation). A single EPE may be used for separate evaluations (e.g. a MSN and
   INSTM/QUAL eval). The combined EPE must be of a scope and duration to cover required
   areas and must be within the requisite zone for each evaluation.
   5.3.2. Satisfactory Performance. Satisfactory performance for EPEs requires taking the
   proper action in the correct sequence, not a verbatim response. Each aircrew member is
   responsible for the Boldface/CAPs applicable to their crew position.
   5.3.3. Content and Administration. AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2 will specify
   contents of EPEs, grading areas to be evaluated, grading criteria and whether EPEs may be
   done inflight, in an ATD, or verbally.
   5.3.4. Grading. The flight examiner will assign an EPE grade 1, 2, or 3 (Qualification
   Level 1, 2, or 3) in the Qualification Ground Phase block of the AF Form 8/8a, regardless of
   whether all or a portion of the EPE was performed inflight.
36                                       AFI11-202V2_920RQWSUP_I 24 FEBRUARY 2010


     5.3.5. Additional Training. For an EPE requiring additional training, the flight examiner
     will indicate if the additional training will be accomplished before next flight under
     restrictions in the Comments block of the AF Form 8/8a.
     5.3.6. Boldface/CAPs Failure. An incorrect response to a Boldface/CAP situation during
     an EPE requires an unqualified (3) EPE grade. An aircrew member who receives a 3 grade as
     a result of Boldface/CAPs error will not fly again until a successful reevaluation is
     accomplished.
     5.3.7. Unqualified EPE. An examinee receiving an unqualified EPE grade (3) will be
     placed on supervised status until a successful reevaluation is accomplished.
     5.3.8. (Added-920RQW) Emergency Procedure Evaluations (EPEs) are administered
     verbally due to non-availability of simulators/training devices. Flight Examiners should use
     EPE scenarios maintained in each SQ Stan/Eval office.
5.4. Supplementary Evaluations. Supplementary evaluations are administrative tools used by
a commander to identify and evaluate implemented solutions to operational problems. These
evaluations are most often administered as inspections (using specifically prepared checklists)
where results are reported to the commander. The form and content of supplementary evaluations
is at the discretion of the commander.
     5.4.1. Supplementary evaluations are not aircrew qualification evaluations.
     5.4.2. Commanders will determine evaluated areas. The stan/eval function will determine the
     method of evaluation, is responsible for administrative management of data collection, and
     will report results as directed by the commander.
     5.4.3. Individuals other than flight examiners, as determined by the OG/CC, may conduct
     supplementary evaluations.
     5.4.4. Supplementary evaluations may be administered in conjunction with a flight
     evaluation. If conducted in-flight, supplementary evaluations should not be all-
     encompassing, nor result in the assignment of an overall rating for any specific aircrew
     member, nor be documented on an AF Form 8/8a.
     5.4.5. Supplementary evaluation results will be documented in SEB minutes.

                                          Chapter 6

                         AIRCREW EXAMINATION PROGRAM

6.1. Purpose. The aircrew examination program measures aircrew member knowledge of
normal/emergency procedures, threats, and other information essential for the safe and effective
operation of their assigned weapon system through the administration of written, computer-based
or electronic examinations. Poor testing performance on examinations indicates areas requiring
increased training emphasis.
6.2. Scope. This chapter applies to rated (pilots, navigators, and air battle managers), career
enlisted aviator (CEA), and non-rated X-prefix AE aircrew. For Flight Surgeons (rated) and non-
rated aircrew (K-, Q-, or other X-prefix Air Force Specialty Code), see Chapter 8. The
examination program in this chapter includes requisite examinations for periodic evaluations and
unit periodic examinations. Requisite examinations include qualification open book and closed
book examinations, instrument examinations and Boldface/CAPs examinations as described in
paragraph 5.2.4. The ability to focus on specific knowledge areas is enhanced by the
management of examination content and use of appropriate master question files.
6.3. Administrative Procedures.
   6.3.1. Program Documentation. Units will describe the unit aircrew examination program
   in the unit supplement to this instruction.
   6.3.1. (920RQW) All test banks (MQFs, Secure Question Banks, etc.) will be maintained
   by OGV using PEX. Alternate areas/means for testing (i.e. deployed, other room, hard copy)
   are authorized if approved by OGV, and the test is administered by a FE or other Stan/Eval
   personnel. Boldface and closed book tests will be taken in a single session, while the open
   book, instrument, Operations Supervisor / Squadron Director of Operations (OPS
   SUP/SQ/DO), FE tests can be completed during more than one session. Hard copy open
   book testing materials may be developed and maintained by OGV. All tests should be
   graded immediately upon completion hard copy tests will be scored and tracked manually
   and the completed test will be placed in the Check ride in Progress (CIP) folder. Tests taken
   as a hard copy will be manually entered into PEX for trending.
   6.3.2. Computer Based or Electronic Examinations. Computer based or electronic
   information management tools may fulfill the requirement for examinations as outlined in
   this instruction.
   6.3.3. Retention of Examination Records. The stan/eval function will retain graded exam
   answer sheets/computer records until the AF Form 8/8a is completed.
   6.3.4. Examination Question Review. The stan/eval function will review all MQFs, secure
   question banks, and prepared exams for accuracy annually and after any changes in source
   documents. If a complete review was accomplished due to a source document change it may
   be annotated as the annual review. Units will document their procedures for reviewing and
   updating MQFs and prepared exams in their unit supplement to this instruction.
   6.3.4. (920RQW) 920 OG/OGV will review all SQBs and MQFs annually in December.

     6.3.5. End-of-Course Examinations. FTUs administering USAF Formal School courses
     listed in the Air Force Education and Training Course Announcement (ETCA) database
     (https://etca.randolph.af.mil/) may use end-of-course (EOC) examinations to fulfill the
     requirements of the open book, closed book and Boldface/CAPS (if applicable) requisite
     examinations.
        6.3.5.1. The stan/eval agencies of the MAJCOM responsible for training will coordinate
        with the MDS lead command to ensure the EOC examination meets the requirements of
        this instruction and AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2 before awarding credit for
        requisite completion.
        6.3.5.2. EOC examination test questions do not need to incorporate MAJCOM MQFs.
        All questions must reflect the latest changes to all systems and/or operational procedures
        and not conflict with any MQFs.
        6.3.5.3. All EOC examinations that fulfill the requirements of requisite examinations will
        be graded according to paragraph 6.4.4.1 and entered on the AF Form 8 according to
        paragraph 7.3.5.1.
        6.3.5.4. (Added-920RQW) When secondary method of a formal school is accomplished
        the examinee will take the standard Open, Closed, Instrument, Boldface examinations in
        lieu of End of Course examinations.
6.4. Requisite Examinations. Aircrew members will complete open book, closed book and
Boldface/CAPs examinations (if applicable) as requisites for periodic QUAL evaluations (see
paragraph 5.2.4.1), instrument examination as requisite for periodic INSTM evaluations (see
paragraph 5.2.4.2), and any other examinations required by the appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS-
Specific Volume 2 (see paragraph 5.2.4.3).
6.4. (920RQW) All Requisite Examinations are a minimum of 40 Questions. Exception:
Combat Rescue Officer / Pararescue Jumpers (CRO/PJs) QUAL evaluation will consist of an
exam requirements as described in AFI 16-1202V2, Pararescue and Combat Rescue Officer
Standardization and Evaluation.
     6.4.1. Requisite Examination Management. With the exception of written Boldface/CAPs
     examinations, maintain either requisite examinations for each crew position or generate a
     unique test for each aircrew member requiring an exam.
        6.4.1.1. If requisite examinations are maintained for each crew position:
            6.4.1.1.1. Units are required to develop and control a minimum of two requisite
            examinations for each crew position.
            6.4.1.1.1. (920RQW) Two different versions of each requisite test will be
            maintained. Annual reviews will confirm that at least 50% of the questions are
            changed.
            6.4.1.1.2. Units having ten or fewer members per crew position require only one
            examination.
AFI11-202V2_920RQWSUP_I 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                    39


         6.4.1.1.3. When different crew positions are responsible for the same information,
         units are not required to maintain separate examinations for each crew position.
         6.4.1.1.4. Change a minimum of 50 percent of the questions on requisite
         examinations each calendar year.
     6.4.1.2. If a unique test is generated for each aircrew member requiring an exam:
         6.4.1.2.1. Units may use MAJCOM-approved software for test creation.
         6.4.1.2.2. Requisite exam databases will contain a sufficient number of questions to
         ensure a probability of no more than 50 percent duplication of questions for each test
         generated.
  6.4.2. Examination Security. Stan/eval personnel will maintain positive control of all
  requisite exams, applicable answer sheets and associated computer based/electronic media.
  EXCEPTION: Requisite Open-book Flight Surgeon examination will be maintained by
  AFMOA/SG3P.
  6.4.2. (920RQW) Examinees will accomplish all requisite testing in the OGV testing area.
  Periodic tests taken as part of mass unit/periodic testing may be accomplished at other
  locations under proper supervision. Tests are administered by OGV, Stan/Eval personnel, or
  any FE. Requisite testing conducted at an alternate location must be approved by OGV on a
  case by case basis.
  6.4.3. Grading Policy For Examinations.
     6.4.3.1. Minimum Passing Grade. The minimum passing grade for Boldface/CAPs
     exams is 100 percent. The minimum passing grade for all other stan/eval requisite
     examinations is 85 percent - corrected to 100 percent.
     6.4.3.2. Requisite and Boldface/CAPs Examination Grading Restriction. Units will
     grade all completed requisite and/or Boldface/CAPs exams prior to the aircrew member’s
     next flight. In the unit supplement to this instruction describe how this restriction is
     enforced.
  6.4.4. Examination Question Sources.
     6.4.4.1. Open Book Requisite Exam. Open book questions will come from
     publications containing information pertinent to the operation of applicable aircraft and
     performance of the assigned mission. The open book subject areas and the publications
     used to generate the exam will be made available to aircrew. Each unit may develop an
     open book secure question bank (SQB) that serves as the source for some or all of the
     open book examination questions. Do not distribute the SQB to unit aircrews and
     safeguard it in the same manner as any other required stan/eval examination. Electronic
     publications may be used for open book examinations.
     6.4.4.2. Closed Book Requisite Exams. Closed book questions will come from MQFs.
     These questions will emphasize system knowledge and information necessary for safe
     flight and mission accomplishment.
     6.4.4.2. (920RQW) Create SQBs from the sources listed in Attachment 11.

           6.4.4.2.1. MDS-Specific MQFs. Lead command MAJCOMs will ensure MDS-
           Specific MQFs containing approved questions for closed book testing are available
           for MAJCOM use and distribution to applicable aircrew.
               6.4.4.2.1.1. The highest organization with a stan/eval function (NAF or unit) may
               develop, maintain and publish MQFs for weapons systems without MAJCOM
               expertise. That organization will submit these MQFs to the MAJCOM for
               approval prior to their publication.
               6.4.4.2.1.2. MAJCOM OPRs will review MQFs annually and distribute changes
               to MQFs as necessary.
                   6.4.4.2.1.2.1. Units may edit MQFs to accommodate local testing procedures,
                   administrative errors and reflect recent changes to systems and/or operational
                   procedures; however, subject matter may not be changed.
                   6.4.4.2.1.2.2. Units will forward edits of MQF questions to the appropriate
                   MAJCOM.
           6.4.4.2.2. Local Procedures MQF. Units may develop and distribute a local
           procedures MQF databank to augment HHQ MQFs.
           6.4.4.2.2. (920RQW) In addition to the Mission Design Series (MDS) specific
           MQF, questions from the locally generated MQFs will be used. The MQFs will be
           available on the OGV web page.
               6.4.4.2.2.1. (Added-920RQW) OGV will develop a local MQF based on
               publications listed in Attachment 13. 301, 308, and 39 RQS/DOW (Department
               of Tactics) will develop any required weapons MQF. Local MQF may be used to
               generate questions in any periodic test.
           6.4.4.2.3. (Added-920RQW) Closed book exams must be completed within one
           testing period.
        6.4.4.3. Instrument Requisite Exams. Instrument test questions come from the
        Instrument MQF maintained by the Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA). The
        selection and content of the questions is dictated by the provisions of AFMAN 11-210.
        6.4.4.3. (920RQW) OGV will generate and revise this exam with consultation from
        squadron Advanced Instrument School (AIS) instructors.
           6.4.4.3.1. (Added-920RQW) There is no time limit for open book examinations.
           Once an open book exam is started the examinee may elect to complete it on a
           different date then when it was started.
     6.4.5. Boldface/CAPs Requisite Examinations.
        6.4.5.1. Aircrew member knowledge of applicable Boldface/CAPs will be evaluated
        through a written examination as a requisite to all periodic QUAL evaluations.
        6.4.5.2. Satisfactory performance for the Boldface/CAPs examination requires writing
        the proper actions in the correct sequence, not necessarily a verbatim response. The flight
        examiner will assign a Boldface/CAPs grade (Q or U) in the Qualification Ground Phase
        block of the AF Form 8/8a.
AFI11-202V2_920RQWSUP_I 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                       41


       6.4.5.2. (920RQW) Any aircrew member failing a Boldface test will be placed on
       supervised status in PEX. The examinee will be subsequently re-tested no earlier than
       the next day. Failed examination dates and dates of successful accomplishment will be
       tracked in PEX.
           6.4.5.2.1. (Added-920RQW) Prior to the EPE, the FE will administer the requisite
           written boldface exam. Immediately grade the boldface exam and annotate the grade
           on the worksheet. If the boldface is graded ―U‖ do not continue with the EPE and
           contact OGV. Document the boldface failure on the 920 RQW EPE worksheet.
       6.4.5.3. (Added-920RQW) Boldface written examinations are given in conjunction
       with Closed Book Qualification examinations.
   6.4.6. Failure to Pass a Requisite Exam. An evaluation will not be complete until all
   failed items have been successfully re-accomplished.
       6.4.6.1. Reexamination Policy. An aircrew member failing a requisite examination at
       any time must be afforded an adequate study period prior to reexamination. For other
       than Boldface/CAPs, the aircrew member will be reevaluated using an alternate exam.
       6.4.6.2. Reexamination Period. Aircrew members who fail a requisite examination
       must complete a successful reexamination by the end of the third month following the
       date of the first failure, or the end of their eligibility period, whichever occurs first.
       Waiver authority to extend the time allowed to successfully complete the examination is
       the OG/CC. Document such waivers with an MFR placed in Section II of the FEF of the
       affected individual. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the affected
       AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks, paragraph D, Additional Comments, when
       action is complete, and remove the MFR from the FEF. Memos for record become a
       permanent part of the FEF only when the Major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not
       addressed or corrected by a later Form 8/8a.
       6.4.6.3. Boldface/CAPs Reexamination Restriction. Aircrew members failing a
       Boldface/CAPs exam will not fly as aircrew members until a successful reexamination is
       accomplished.
       6.4.6.4. Supervised Status Requirement. Place aircrew members who fail a requisite
       open book, closed book, or instrument examination in supervised status until successful
       retesting is completed. For aircrew members who maintain multiple qualifications,
       supervised status resulting from failure of either an open or closed book examination
       applies only to the aircraft for which the examination was administered. Failure of a
       requisite instrument exam results in the examinee being placed in supervised status in all
       aircraft in which instrument qualification is required.
6.5. Unit Periodic Examinations (optional). Each group/squadron stan/eval function may
conduct periodic testing for all aircrew. The intent of this testing is to evaluate additional
knowledge beyond the scope of requisite exams, such as a cross-section of general knowledge,
tactical/threat knowledge, and/or operational procedures, etc., to determine if knowledge
deficiencies exist within the unit. This exam may be open or closed book, but will not count as a
requisite exam, nor will a requisite exam satisfy the requirement for a periodic exam. Units will
describe this program in the unit supplement to this instruction, to include procedures for failed
exams.

6.5. (920RQW) The OPR for periodic examinations is OGV. Tests should emphasize
tactical employment, squadron standards, and/or other areas deemed appropriate by OGV.
Examinations are a minimum of 20 questions. OGV will establish guidance for examination
disposition (Open/Closed book, Pass/Fail) for each periodic exam.
     6.5.1. (Added-920RQW) Periodic semiannual testing is a Go/No-go task for all members
     and is tracked via FCIF as ―semi-annual test.‖ Periodic semiannual testing should be
     accomplished at selected Unit Training Assemblies (normally February and August) and may
     be developed from current trends, areas of interest, new systems, general knowledge and
     other areas deemed appropriate by OGV. The test will be correctable to 100%.
        6.5.1.1. (Added-920RQW) Boldface testing is a Go/No-go item for all applicable
        aircrew prior to the first flight of each month and is tracked via FCIF as ―Bold Face.‖
        The Operations Squadron Duty Officer (Sup/SDO) is responsible for ensuring this test is
        graded prior to the crew briefing. Completed exams will be kept at the Ops desk until the
        end of each month. If an exam is failed, as determined by the OPS SUP / SDO, a re-test
        can be given immediately if approved by the TOP-3 or SQ/DO.
            6.5.1.1.1. (Added-920RQW) Instructors and above may grade BOLDFACE
            examinations.
            6.5.1.1.2. (Added-920RQW) The Ops Supervisor will not let crews step to the
            plane unless he has verified the examination is complete and an AF IMT 1522, ARMS
            Additional Training Accomplishment Report has been submitted to DOTF.
            6.5.1.1.3. (Added-920RQW) Aircraft        Commanders      are   responsible       for
            administering, grading and tracking completion when away from home station.

                                           Chapter 7

                                     DOCUMENTATION

7.1. Scope. Administration of the aircrew qualification evaluation program requires accurate
documentation. The qualifications and authorizations for which an aircrew member is to be
evaluated are determined from the unit certification document. The results of aircrew evaluations
are recorded on the AF Form 8 or AF Form 8a, which certifies the qualification of the aircrew
member. The chronological history of evaluations for an aircrew member is recorded on an AF
Form 942, Record of Evaluation. These AF forms are maintained in the FEF for the aircrew
member. EXCEPTION: Not required for cadets participating in USAFA airmanship programs.
7.2. Qualifications and Certifications. Aircrew qualifications are attained through evaluations
and documented on the AF Form 8 or the AF Form 8a, as applicable. Aircrew certifications
attained through methods other than evaluation (instructor-certified events and commander
certifications for example) may be documented on an AF Form 1381, USAF Certification of Air
Crew Training, or AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications. As an alternative to use of AF
Form 1381 or AF Form 4348, MAJCOMs may approve use of a unit certification document
signed by an authorized official.
7.2. (920RQW) Qualifications and Certifications. The AF Form 4348, Aircrew
Certifications is the source document for aircrew related certifications. SQ Stan/Eval will
generate a Letter of Xs that reflects the AF Form 4348. The Letter of Xs may be used as the
source document for other non-aircrew related certifications e.g. Drop Zone Controller (DZC),
Ops Sup, Joint Air-drop Inspector (JAI), Red X.
7.3. AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.
   7.3.1. Purpose. Use the AF Form 8 to record aircrew qualification. Certification of an AF
   Form 8 is accomplished by four individuals, beginning with the Flight Examiner, who
   completes the evaluation by signing the AF Form 8. Next, the Reviewing Officer and Final
   Approving Officer review the contents, the flight examiner’s overall assessment, ensure all
   required additional training was adequate to correct the noted deficiencies and is complete,
   and sign the AF Form 8. The final signature is provided by the examinee, who will sign the
   completed AF Form 8. EXCEPTION: For a Commander-Directed Downgrade AF Form 8,
   only the commander signs as the Final Approving Officer. See paragraph 7.4.8.
       7.3.1.1. Use a separate AF Form 8 for all flight phase rechecks.
       7.3.1.2. Ground rechecks will be completed on the original Q-3 AF Form 8 (see
       paragraph 7.3.9).
   7.3.2. General Data Entry. Use the following guidance when completing an AF Form 8.
   See Attachment 3 for sample AF Forms 8.
       7.3.2.1. For date fields in the AF Form 8 use a two-digit day, three-letter month and two-
       digit year format. For electronic forms, use the date format required by the form.
       7.3.2.2. The Eligibility Period and Expiration Date of Qualification will use a three-letter
       month and two-digit year format. For electronic forms, use the date format required by
       the form.

        7.3.2.3. Except for the organization of the Comments block described in paragraph
        7.3.7, sample AF Forms 8 are provided to demonstrate the content, not the format, of the
        data presented (see Attachment 3).
        7.3.2.4. To facilitate the entry of data on the form, except where specifically noted
        otherwise, use upper and lower case letters.
        7.3.2.5. Requirements for letter font, numbers of spaces for indentation and justification
        (right, left or centered) of data are not specified. MAJCOM supplements may direct
        specific format standards for such data entry.
     7.3.3. Date Completed.
        7.3.3.1. Use the latest completion date (ground or flight phase) of the evaluation
        requisites or the additional training.
        7.3.3.2. Use this date on the AF Form 942.
     7.3.4. Section I - Examinee Identification.

     and maintain evaluation information until the AF Form 8a is completed and filed in the
     Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF).
        7.4.8.2.1. (Added-920RQW) FEs will complete the 920 OG/OGV evaluation
        worksheet and place them in examinee’s CIP folder. When all requisites are
        complete, the signed draft (AF Form 8a or OG/OGV evaluation worksheet) will be
        placed in the examinee’s FEF and will serve as the Temporary AF Form 8a with FE
        signature until the AF Form 8a coordination process is complete.
     7.4.8.3. Remove the temporary evaluation certificate when the permanent AF Form 8a is
     filed in the FEF.

        7.4.8.4. File the completed AF Form 8a (all reviews/approvals accomplished) in the FEF
        not later than the end of the third month following the date completed on the AF Form 8a.
     7.4.9. Ground Rechecks for Evaluations Requiring a Flight Phase Evaluation.
        7.4.9.1. Ground rechecks are accomplished subsequent to the debriefing of an
        unqualified evaluation when the flight examiner deems a flight recheck unnecessary.
        7.4.9.2. The ground recheck will be documented on the original AF Form 8a generated
        to document the Q-3 flight evaluation.
        7.4.9.3. To document the ground recheck, follow instructions in paragraphs 7.4.3
        through 7.4.6, except as noted below:
           7.4.9.3.1. Date Completed. Use the latest completion date (ground phase or
           successful ground recheck) of the evaluation.
           7.4.9.3.2. Flight Phase. Document the date of the ground recheck on a separate line
           as ―GROUND RECHECK‖ below the flight evaluation entry under Flight Phase.
           7.4.9.3.3. Qualification Level. Annotate overall qualification as ―1‖ in the qualified
           block after successful completion of Ground Recheck.
           7.4.9.3.4. Expiration Date of Qualification. For evaluations that establish a new
           eligibility period, enter the month and year that is 17 months after the month in which
           the ground recheck was successfully completed.
           7.4.9.3.5. Examiner's Remarks: Recommended Additional Training. Document all
           recommended additional training associated with grading areas where deficiencies
           will be remedied by a ground recheck under subparagraph labeled Ground.
           7.4.9.3.6. The flight examiner that completed the flight evaluation will sign the front
           of the AF Form 8a. If the recheck examiner is different than the initial flight
           examiner, the recheck examiner will sign and date an appropriate statement in the
           Comments/Examiner’s Remarks.
7.5. Commander-Directed Downgrade.

     chain of command may direct a downgrade to an intermediate level of
     qualification/certification or unqualified/decertified status without administering an
     evaluation under the following guidance:
        7.5.1.1. For flying-related cases, use for cause only, e.g., breach of flying discipline or
        flight safety - including incidents not observed by an examiner, or observed, but by an
        examiner of another aircrew specialty.
        7.5.1.2. For non-flying-related cases, do not use as a substitution for, or in lieu of,
        administrative or judicial actions. Use in cases where such actions directly affect the
        commander’s confidence in the aircrew member’s flying or performance ability to safely
        operate the aircraft and/or equipment.

7.6. AF Form 1381, USAF Certification of Air Crew Training. Optional. If used, comply
with the following guidance when completing an AF Form 1381. MAJCOMs may prescribe use
of AF Form 1381 or AF Form 4348 (see paragraph 7.7). If prescribed, use either form. See
Attachment 6 for sample AF Form 1381.
7.6. (920RQW) 920 OG/OGV will ensure that all AF Forms 1381, USAF Certification of Air
Crew Training are transcribed onto AF Forms 4348. The Squadron/CC, OG/CC or OGV Chief
will sign a one line entry signifying acceptance.
   7.6.1. Purpose. The AF Form 1381 provides a permanent record/certification source for
   aircrew certifications not attained through an AF Form 8/8a qualification. (MAJCOMs may
   approve use of a unit certification document signed by an authorized official. An authorized
   official for a unit certification document will be an official authorized to approve an AF
   Form 8 or 8a, or another appropriate authority designated in writing by this official.)
      7.6.1.1. Maintain a separate AF Form 1381 in the FEF, Section I, documenting
      certifications by individual assigned flying unit and primary MDS. For aircrew members
      with multiple aircraft certifications attained through difference training, only one AF
      Form 1381 is required; specify the primary mission MDS designation. File AF Forms
      1381 in chronological order with the most recent on top. Note: May also be filed in an
      aircrew member’s permanent training folder, as a training completion document. When
      AF Form 1381 is used as a training completion document, refer to AFI 11-202, Volume
      1, for guidance.
      7.6.1.2. Unit stan/eval will document all initial, downgrade and re-certifications for
      aircrew assigned/attached to their flying unit to indicate a chronological history of
      certifications of aircrew while assigned/attached to their flying unit.
          7.6.1.2.1. The AF Form 1381 will document all certifications attained in previous
          and current MDS(s). Retain as a historical source document. File AF Forms 1381 in
          chronological order with the most recent on top.
          7.6.1.2.2. During the initial review of individual FEF, also review AF Form 1381
          entries in the aircrew member’s training folder to determine applicable certifications
          of new assigned/attached aircrew members. Document aircrew certifications as
          specified by the assigned/attached flying unit commander on a new AF Form 1381.
              7.6.1.2.2.1. The OGV/DOV Chief or other individual designated by the squadron
              commander will sign a one line entry below all other entries signifying acceptance
              of those events listed above (see paragraph 7.6.7 for documentation
              requirements).
          7.6.1.2.3. AFI 11-202, Volume 2/MAJCOM Supplement will specify AF Form 1381
          certifying officials, IAW paragraph 7.6.3.4.
      7.6.1.3. Do not use AF Form 1381 to document one-time training/new equipment unless
      directed by HHQ.
      7.6.1.4. Appropriate guidance that may require aircrew certification using AF Form 1381
      entry include AFI 11-202, Volume 2/MAJCOM Supplement; AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific
      Volume 1; AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 3, MDS XX - Operations Procedures;
      CONOPS; HHQ messages; and local unit guidance.

        7.6.1.5. MAJCOMs supplements may specify procedures or sources for preparing AF
        Forms 1381.
     7.6.2. General Data Entry.
        7.6.2.1. Complete individual identification block with last name, first name, middle
        initial, any titles (e.g., Jr. or II) and last four of SSAN.
        7.6.2.2. Use one line for each certification or decertification.
        7.6.2.3. Enter each certification or decertification in chronological order base on the date
        the action is completed.
        7.6.2.4. For date fields in the AF Form 1381, use a two-digit day, three-letter month and
        two-digit year format (e.g., 20 Dec 05), or as required by electronic form (20051220).

        7.6.3.2. Subject Title. Enter each certification title on the AF Form 1381.
        7.6.3.3. Date Certified. Enter the effective date of certification.
            7.6.3.3.1. For certifications attained as part of a FTU, the date will match the date of
            the applicable AF Form 8/8a, or enter the date of completion or graduation from FTU
            if no AF Form 8/8a is issued.
        7.6.3.4. Certification Official/Organization. The Certifying Official will sign above their
        typed name, rank, organization and office symbol.
        7.6.3.5. The Certifying Official is the person authorized by governing directives to

     7.6.4. Decertification. Decertification of events fall into two categories: Decertification for
     Cause (with prejudice) and Discretionary Decertification (without prejudice).
        7.6.4.1. Decertification for Cause. Used for observed substandard performance.
            7.6.4.1.1. This action is normally associated with Commander-Directed Downgrade,
            but also apples to commander-directed decertification of evaluators (resulting from
            substandard performance).
            7.6.4.1.2. To document Decertification for Cause, line out the event, date and
            certifying official/organization/location; annotate ―Decertification for Cause‖ under
            Training Requirement/Subject Title; enter date of decertification under Date
            Completed; enter name, rank, organization, and office symbol and signature of
            decertifying official under Certifying Official/Organization.
        7.6.4.2. Discretionary Decertification. An administrative action not based on
        performance.
AFI11-202V2_920RQWSUP_I 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                     67


         7.6.4.2.1. Such decertification is warranted when loss of currency or certification
         occurs that will not be regained IAW AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 1, when
         instructor certified events become core mission events, or when a higher certification
         is obtained making the previous entry obsolete. Discretionary Decertification is also
         applicable for decertification of flight examiners as a result of reasons other than
         substandard performance.
         7.6.4.2.2. To document Discretionary Decertification: line out the event, date and
         certifying official/organization/location; annotate ―Discretionary Decertification‖
         under Training Requirement/Subject Title; enter date of decertification under Date
         Completed; enter name, rank, organization and office symbol of the decertifying
         official under Certifying Official/Organization. Note: For decertification due to loss
         of currency with no requirement for re-certification, the effective date of
         decertification will be the date of certification loss.
         7.6.4.2.3. For events that have changed in name only (e.g., In-Flight Refueling to Air
         Refueling) no action is necessary. If desired for clarity: line out the event, date and
         certifying official/organization/location; annotate ―Renamed (new name)‖ under
         Subject Title.
         7.6.4.2.4. For members who change MDS while assigned/attached to the same
         stan/eval organization, prepare a new AF Form 1381 indicating the new MDS and
         transcribe all events which apply to the new MDS IAW paragraph 7.6.1.2.2.
  7.6.5. Unusual Circumstances. When unusual circumstances require additional
  information for an AF Form 1381 entry, use additional lines as necessary or reaccomplish the
  AF Form 1381.
  7.6.6. Computer Generated AF Forms 1381. Units may use a computer-generated AF
  Form 1381 to make new entries or corrections as long as cumulative hard copy entries are
  maintained. Computer-generated forms must mirror AF forms as published on the Air Force
  e-Publishing web site.
     7.6.6.1. A computer-generated AF Form 1381 must be signed IAW paragraph
     7.6.1.2.2.1.
     7.6.6.2. The last signature on a computer-generated AF Form 1381 certifies:
         7.6.6.2.1. New or rescinded certification attained while assigned/attached to unit of
         certifying official.
         7.6.6.2.2. All cumulative entries were maintained; that they were signed or had
         proper documentation; or were carried forward from a previously signed computer-
         generated AF Form 1381.
  7.6.7. Unit Supplement. Describe unit AF Form 1381 procedures/program. Include a list of
  certifications applicable to the unit with appropriate source documents and designated
  certifying officials. Document procedures to ensure certifications reflected on AF Form 1381
  are also included in ARMS. Annotate if someone other than the Chief of OGV/DOV has
  been authorized by the squadron commander to sign the last line of an AF Form 1381.

7.7. AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications. Optional. Use in place of AF Form 1831
when used. If used, comply with the following guidance when completing an AF Form 4348. See
Attachment 7 for sample AF Forms 4348.
7.7. (920RQW) AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications. For new entries on the AF
Form 4348, the SQ/CC, OG/CC or OGV Chief will sign a one line entry signifying acceptance.
     7.7.1. Purpose. The AF Form 4348 provides a permanent record and certification source for
     aircrew certifications not attained through an AF Form 8/8a qualification.
        7.7.1.1. Maintain a separate AF Form 4348 in the FEF, Section I, under tab 1
        documenting certifications by assigned flying unit and primary MDS. For aircrew
        members with aircraft certifications in multiple MDS aircraft which do not require
        qualification in each aircraft (i.e. F-16C and F-16CG), only one AF Form 4348 is
        required; specify the primary mission MDS designation. File AF Forms 4348 in
        chronological order with the most recent on top.
        7.7.1.2. Unit stan/eval will document all initial, downgrade and re-certifications for
        aircrew assigned/attached to their flying unit to indicate a chronological history of
        certifications of aircrew while assigned/attached to their flying unit.
            7.7.1.2.1. The AF Form 4348 will document all certifications attained in previous
            and current MDS(s). Retain in the FEF, Section I, under tab 1, as a historical source
            document. File AF Forms 4348 in chronological order with the most recent on top.
            7.7.1.2.2. During the initial review of individual FEF, also review previous AF Form
            4348 entries to determine all applicable certifications of new assigned/attached
            aircrew member. Then, document applicable aircrew certifications accepted by the

            is obtained making the previous entry obsolete. Discretionary Decertification is also
            applicable for decertification of flight examiners as a result of reasons other than
            substandard performance.
            7.7.4.2.2. To document Discretionary Decertification, place an ―X‖ in the appropriate
            box; enter date of decertification under Decertification Date block; enter name, rank,
            organization and office symbol and signature of the decertifying official under
            Decertifying Official/Organization block; see Attachment 7. Note: For
            decertification due to loss of currency with no requirement for re-certification, the
            effective date of decertification will be the date of certification loss.
            7.7.4.2.3. For events that have changed in name only (e.g., In-Flight Refueling to Air
            Refueling) no action is necessary. If desired for clarity: annotate ―Renamed (new

        7.7.1.2.2.1, 7.7.3.4, 7.7.4.1, and 7.7.4.2 as applicable.
        7.7.6.2. The signature on a computer-generated AF Form 4348 certifies:
            7.7.6.2.1. New or rescinded certification attained while assigned/attached to unit of
            certifying official.
            7.7.6.2.2. All cumulative entries were maintained; that they were signed or had
            proper documentation; or were carried forward from a previously signed computer-
            generated AF Form 4348.
     7.7.7. Unit Supplement. Describe unit AF Form 4348 procedures/program. Include a list of
     certifications applicable to the unit with appropriate source documents and designated
     certifying officials. Document procedures to ensure certifications reflected on AF Form 4348
     are also included in ARMS. Annotate if someone other than the Chief of OGV/DOV has
     been authorized by the squadron commander to sign the last line of an AF Form 4348 to

   made for each change in the MAJCOM under which an evaluation was administered.
   7.8.7. Computer Generated AF Form 942. A computer generated AF Form 942 may be
   used as long as cumulative entries are retained. Computer-generated forms must mirror AF
   forms as published on the Air Force e-Publishing web site. Electronic copies of the AF Form
   942 should be forwarded with the FEF when the individual moves to a new squadron. If
   electronic backups are normally maintained on removable storage media (e.g., DVD-
   ROM/CD-ROM, external hard drive, floppy disk) or are specifically prepared to facilitate
   transfer of an FEF, file the storage media in Section I of the FEF.
7.9. Flight Evaluation Folders The FEF contains the source documents that constitute the
history of flying qualification for each aircrew member. The AF Form 8/8a is the source
document used to record and certify the qualification of an aircrew member. A complete history
of the AF Forms 8/8a in an FEF is maintained on an accompanying AF Form 942.
   7.9.1. Maintenance. Each aircrew member who is on flying status must have a FEF, which
   includes all AF Forms 8/8a, AF Forms 942, AF Forms 1381/4348 (optional; see paragraphs

AFI11-202V2_920RQWSUP_I 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                    73


         or more crew positions in the same mission design aircraft will file AF Forms 8/8a in
         chronological order – without consideration of MDS or crew position.
         7.9.2.2.2. Memos for record documenting waivers and extensions are filed on top of
         the affected AF Form 8/8a. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto
         the affected AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks paragraph D, Additional
         Comments, when action is complete, and remove the MFR from the FEF. Permanent
         MFRs documenting major discrepancies relating to qualification (see paragraph
         7.8.5.1.1) are filed immediately above the latest affected AF Form 8/8a or, in cases
         where the memo is for items other than those found on AF Forms 8/8a, in
         chronological order with AF Forms 8/8a. Memos for record become a permanent part
         of the FEF only when the Major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed
         or corrected by a later Form 8/8a.
         7.9.2.2.3. Memos for record documenting major discrepancies of a particular AF
         Form 8/8a will be filed on top of that AF Form 8/8a regardless of date the
         discrepancy is discovered.
         7.9.2.2.4. Memos for record documenting similar discrepancies found on multiple
         AF Forms 8/8a will be filed on top of the latest affected AF Form 8/8a.
         7.9.2.2.5. Copies of these source documents may be filed with other unit agencies for
         evaluation program management.
  7.9.3. Description of Folders.
     7.9.3.1. Folders must be letter size, able to separate contents into two sections and
     constructed of heavy stock (recommend press board folder or equivalent).
     7.9.3.2. Standard 2 ¾-inch metal fasteners may be used.
     7.9.3.3. Affix a label bearing the individual’s name and last four of SSAN to the inside
     back cover so that the folder may be identified when filed. Include additional information
     on the label if required.
     7.9.3.4. Folders must bear the ―Privacy Act‖ statement or a ―For Official Use Only‖
     label/stamp on both sides of the FEF folder.
  7.9.4. Review of FEF. Document the procedures on how to accomplish an initial review
  and how to implement the periodic review of FEFs in the unit supplement to this instruction.
  7.9.4. (920RQW) 2 OG/OGV will review each AF Form 8/8a or AF Form 4348 when they
  are placed in the FEF to ensure accuracy and completeness using the 10AF FEF checklist
  located on the 10AF Stan/Eval CoP. They will also ensure PEX documentation is correct.
  Minor discrepancies found will be documented in the Minor Discrepancy Log spreadsheet.
  If major discrepancies are found, OGV will generate a correct AF Form 8/8a and re-route for
  signatures whenever practical. An MFR will be produced if generating an AF Form 8 is
  impractical (i.e. signing official has Permanent Change of Station (PCS), retired, etc.).
  Posting review accomplishment will be annotated in the SEB minutes.
     7.9.4.1. Initial Review. The flying unit will review the FEF for all newly assigned
     aircrew members to establish their currency and qualification prior to their first flight.
74                                       AFI11-202V2_920RQWSUP_I 24 FEBRUARY 2010


           7.9.4.1.1. The reviewing organization is responsible for establishing the currency and
           qualification of the aircrew member as determined from the latest applicable
           documentation in Sections I and II of the FEF. Following determination of the
           currency and qualification of the aircrew member, the unit maintaining the FEF is
           responsible only for documentation subsequently placed in the FEF.
           7.9.4.1.2. If the FEF of HHQ personnel on active flying status is maintained by the
           stan/eval function at their assigned stations, that stan/eval function will also review
           the FEF prior to their first flight.
           7.9.4.1.3. (Added-920RQW) OGV chief will conduct an initial review of all
           aircrew (not visiting flyers) FEF prior to their first flight using the 920 RQW FEF
           Initial Review Sheet/10AF FEF checklist located on the 10AF Stan/Eval CoP. The
           review will emphasize current qualifications (top 2 AF Forms 8) and major
           discrepancies. Qualifications, expected next evaluations, and examinations will be
           assigned in PEX during this review. OG/OGV will complete an AF Form 4324,
           Aircraft Assignment / Qualification Worksheet route to Squadron Aviation Resource
           Management (SARM) for Aviation Resource Management Systems (ARMS) input
           and Division of Training DOT for Certification Document inclusion.
        7.9.4.2. Posting Review. The stan/eval function will review each AF Form 8/8a, AF
        Form 1381, or AF Form 4348 when they are placed in the FEF to ensure accuracy and
        completeness. This review will confirm that the eligibility period and qualification as
        documented are correct, all required flight evaluation events were accomplished and
        requisites were accomplished within the eligibility period and that the AF Form 8/8a
        contains all signatures and initials within allotted time. AF Forms 1381/4348 will be
        reviewed for correct certification signature and to ensure all previous entries are
        accounted for and are accurate. Document the posting review IAW unit or MAJCOM
        supplement.
        7.9.4.3. Periodic Review. The stan/eval function will review all unit FEFs to confirm
        expiration dates used to track required aircrew qualification evaluations are the same as
        those listed in the FEFs. The interval between reviews will not exceed the qualification
        period window established by paragraph 5.2.6.1 unless a more restrictive review period is
        established by the MAJCOM supplement. Document the periodic review IAW unit or
        MAJCOM supplement. Periodic review of FEFs for personnel in inactive status is not
        required.
        7.9.4.3. (920RQW) Periodic reviews will be conducted annually during the first half
        using the 10AF FEF checklist located on the 10AF Stan/Eval Community of Practice.
        Periodic review accomplishment will be documented and tracked in SEB minutes.
     7.9.5. FEF Discrepancies. FEF Discrepancies include those of the AF Forms 8/8a, AF
     Form 1381, AF Form 4348, and AF Form 942.
        7.9.5.1. Categories of Discrepancies. Discrepancies are categorized by their impact on
        qualification/certification.
           7.9.5.1.1. Discrepancies that alter the qualification/certification of the affected
           aircrew member are considered major.
AFI11-202V2_920RQWSUP_I 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                    75


        7.9.5.1.2. Those discrepancies that do not alter the qualification/certification of the
        affected aircrew member are considered minor and include typos, formatting and
        misspellings.
     7.9.5.2. Major Discrepancies Disposition. Identified major discrepancies are
     documented on a permanent MFR filed in Section I or II immediately above the affected
     AF Form 8/8a/1381/4348, or in chronological order with the AF Forms 8/8a/1381/4348
     for items other than those found on AF Forms 8/8a/1381/4348. An MFR created to
     document late evaluations, OG/CC waivers, etc. is removed from the FEF once the
     information is incorporated onto the completed affected AF Form 8/8a under Examiner
     Remarks paragraph D, Additional Comments. Memos for record become a permanent
     part of the FEF only when the major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed
     or corrected by a later AF Form 8/8a.
     7.9.5.3. Minor Discrepancies Disposition. Minor discrepancies are documented on a
     non-permanent record as defined by the unit supplement to this instruction.
     7.9.5.3. (920RQW) Minor discrepancies will be documented in a Minor Discrepancy
     Log spreadsheet. The AF Form 8 date, discrepancy, reason, and corrective action should
     be annotated if known.
        7.9.5.3.1. The record of minor discrepancies is to be used to ensure standardization
        of AF Forms 8/8a, AF Forms 942, AF Forms 1381, AF Forms 4348, and aircrew
        member FEFs.
        7.9.5.3.2. Record of minor discrepancies need not reside in the FEF.
        7.9.5.3.3. Any records of minor discrepancies kept in the FEF will be removed prior
        to any permanent change in station or status of the affected aircrew member.
     7.9.5.4. Corrections.
        7.9.5.4.1. AF Form 8/8a. As a source document, the AF Form 8/8a may be
        corrected by use of white-out/over-print or pen and ink alteration of the original

                        SPECIALIZED AIRCREW PROCEDURES

8.1. Purpose This chapter provides guidance for Flight Surgeons and non-rated aircrew
personnel to include K-, Q-, and X- prefix Air Force Specialty Codes. EXCEPTION: Chapter
8 does not apply to X-prefix Aeromedical Evacuation crewmembers.
8.2. Flight Surgeon.
   8.2.1. Flight Surgeon Qualification. Basic initial and periodic flight surgeon qualification
   consists of an open-book examination; a flight evaluation is not required. Upon completion
   of the basic examination, flight surgeons will be qualified in all USAF aircraft (universal
   qualification). MAJCOMs and subordinate units may direct additional general and MDS-
   Specific flight surgeon requirements. Qualification requirements will be documented on AF
   Form 8/8a. Certification requirements will be documented on AF Forms 1381/4348.
   Qualification and certification, when required, must be accomplished before flight as an
   aircrew member.
   8.2.2. Evaluations. Flight surgeon initial, periodic, and MDS-Specific (if required)
   examinations are considered QUAL evaluations. Other examinations are not required by this
   AFI, but may be prescribed in MAJCOM and subordinate unit supplements.
   8.2.3. Timing of Flight Surgeon Evaluations.
      8.2.3.1. Expiration Date. The required periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the
      17th month following the month in which the date of the AF Form 8/8a was successfully
      completed.
      8.2.3.2. Scheduling. Schedule the periodic evaluation in the eligibility period (6-month
      period prior to expiration date).
      8.2.3.3. Extended Evaluations. The OG/CC may extend the expiration date of the Flight
      Surgeon periodic evaluation up to three months on a case-by-case basis. Inform
      AFMSA/SGPA. Document extended evaluations IAW paragraph 5.2.6.3.4.
   8.2.4. Requisite Completion. MAJCOMs may establish requisites for flight surgeons as
   necessary. Requisites from a completed evaluation or an examination used for re-currency
   will not be used for subsequent evaluations. All requisites for scheduled periodic evaluations
   in the eligibility period must be completed within the 6-month eligibility period prior to the
   expiration date of the current evaluation period to update that expiration date.
   8.2.5. Grading Policies. An overall qualification level of Q-1 will be awarded upon the
   successful completion of the flight surgeon examination(s).
   8.2.6. Flight Surgeon Failure to Complete an Evaluation Within the Required
   Period. If a flight surgeon fails to complete an evaluation prior to the qualification
   expiration date, the flight surgeon loses the qualification covered by the evaluation. The
   flight surgeon will not fly as a crew member until successful completion of the delinquent
   evaluation.

     8.2.7. Flight Surgeon Examination.
        8.2.7.1. Administrative Procedures. Flight surgeons will complete a standardized
        open-book examination. Questions will be randomly generated from a test bank
        maintained by AFMOA/SG3P. MAJCOMs and subordinate organizations may establish
        additional requirements. Examinations will be completed in the unit stan/eval testing
        area or other appropriate location approved by the unit stan/eval chief.
        8.2.7.1. (920RQW) Flight surgeon universal QUAL examinations are tracked and
        conducted by OGV. The Flight Surgeon Examination procedures for QUAL include
        completing the online exam available at https://afms.csd.disa.mil/kc/login.login.aspat.
        Flight Surgeons can either complete the course online and provide OGV with a
        certificate, or complete the examination in the OGV testing area. Flight Surgeons will
        complete the online examination during the 6-month eligibility period. Examination
        results will be documented and maintained by OGV until completion of the AF Form 8a.
        PEX will be used to track this requirement. If not accomplished during the eligibility
        period, the individual will be placed in a ―no-Go‖ status in PEX until the examination is
        successfully completed. For all Flight Surgeons, the Qual examination will be
        administered before the Flight Surgeon’s first flight.
        8.2.7.2. Grading Policy for Examination. The minimum passing grade for exams is 85
        percent – corrected to 100 percent. The open book examination will be corrected to 100%
        and a certificate will be generated following successful completion. Units will validate
        successful completion of all required exams prior to flight. Document examination
        scores as Pass/Fail on the AF Form 8/8a.
        8.2.7.3. Examination Question Sources. AFMOA/SG3P, in coordination with
        AF/A3O-AT, will develop the basic flight surgeon examination. AF/A3O-AT will
        coordinate with applicable MAJCOMs.
        8.2.7.4. Failure to Pass a Requisite Exam. An evaluation will not be complete until
        failed exams have been successfully re-accomplished.
           8.2.7.4.1. Reexamination Policy. A flight surgeon failing a requisite examination at
           any time must be afforded an adequate study period prior to reexamination. The flight
           surgeon will be reevaluated using an alternate exam.
           8.2.7.4.2. Reexamination Period. Failed requisite examination must be completed by

9.2. Flight Related Special Interest Item (SII).
     9.2.1. Flight Related SIIs are items of emphasis of existing procedure(s) designed to mitigate
     or eliminate specific risks or trends. SIIs do not add to or amend established procedures. SIIs
     will be based on analysis of risks and trends from a variety of sources to include Safety
     Investigation Board (SIB) findings/recommendations, safety related incidences, trend
     analysis, deployed area of operations and potential problems with equipment/procedures.
     9.2.2. SII(s) should normally be of limited duration (i.e. not to exceed 90 days) so as to
     maintain the focus. If the situation for which the SII was issued remains, consideration
     should be given to amending current procedures and issuing corrective action via a command
     message or FCIF.
     9.2.3. SII(s) may be issued/rescinded from the MAJCOM, NAF or unit level.
     9.2.4. MAJCOM/NAF SII(s) will be issued to applicable unit OGVs in a message format
     identifying the following elements: subject/title, unique DTG, specific MDS applicability,
     references (document, SIB, etc) risk and trend details, specific emphasis actions to
     reduce/eliminate the risk or trend that is the SII topic, effective date of rescission, and
     SME/POC for further information.
     9.2.5. Units will place all MAJCOM/NAF issued SIIs into the FCIF, Current Read File, Part
     B, for dissemination to crewmembers.
     9.2.6. All current flight-related MDS-Specific and CRM/ORM related SII(s) will be briefed
     during flight briefings for the duration of the SII(s). Mission related SII(s) need only be
     briefed on those missions for which the SII is relevant.
     9.2.7. Current MAJCOM/NAF and unit issued SII(s) will be identified in Flight Crew
     Information Summary (FCIS) attachments. Units that do not publish a FCIS will maintain
     current SII(s) in Part B of their FCIF until rescinded.
9.3. Go/No-Go Procedures Units will establish a positive control system that ensures aircrew
members have completed all ground training and stan/eval items required for flight.
9.3. (920RQW) Go/No-Go Procedures. The flight authorization authenticating official will
verify aircrew Go/No-Go status, except for FCIF and Boldface, prior to signing the flight
authorization. The OPS SUP/SDO will verify all items of aircrew Go/No-Go status are complete
prior to releasing the crew for flight. Units will utilize PEX Go/No-Go program and ARMS
products. The following items will be checked for Go/No-Go prior to each flight:
     9.3.1. As a minimum, the Go/No Go system will monitor:
     9.3.1. (920RQW) ARMS products checked for events and currencies required by AFI 11-
     2MDS-Specific, Volume 1 and AFI 11-202V1/ACC Sup 1 Flying Operations (non-currency
     will result in grounding, flying in supervised status, or restricting the mission profile,
     depending on the non-current events):
        9.3.1.1. The training items from AFI 11-202, Volume 1, required for flight.
        9.3.1.1. (920RQW) FCIF (Part B currency mandatory, Part D currency desired)
        9.3.1.2. The ground training items required for flight from the applicable AFI 11-2
        MDS-Specific Volume 1.
AFI11-202V2_920RQWSUP_I 24 FEBRUARY 2010                                                      87


     9.3.1.2. (920RQW) Boldface Testing (applicable crewmembers only)
     9.3.1.3. The aircrew physical, physiological training, centrifuge training, egress training,
     and current Aeronautical Order items IAW AFI 11-421, Aviation Resource Management.
     9.3.1.3. (920RQW) Duty not involving flying (DNIF) status
     9.3.1.4. The stan/eval examination items required for flight from AFI 11-202, Volume
     2/MAJCOM Supplement.
     9.3.1.4. (920RQW) Supervised status
     9.3.1.5. Any aircrew Duty Not Involving Flying (DNIF) status.
     9.3.1.5. (920RQW) Valid Aeronautical Order
     9.3.1.6. Currency on all FCIF (Volume 1, Part B and C (Note: Part C is optional)) items.
     9.3.1.6. (920RQW) Applicable Combat Mission Ready training currencies
     9.3.1.7. (Added-920RQW) Visiting Aircrews. The squadron aviation resource manager
     collects and reviews all required ARMS products/currencies to ensure a visiting (inter-
     fly) crewmember is qualified and current before placing the individual on the flight
     authorization. Visiting aircrew will initial and annotate the current Part B FCIF number
     on the flight authorization before flight
  9.3.2. Units will define and publish their positive control system in the unit supplement to
  this instruction.
  9.3.2. (920RQW) The PEX Go/No-Go computer program located at the Ops Sup/SDO
  counter can be used by applicable aircrew to record and track the review or accomplishment
  of certain Go/No-go items. Currently PEX is used to track and indicate Go/No-go status
  using DNIF, S/E testing, FCIF, etc. Aircrew indicating ―red‖ in these columns are not
  cleared to fly.
     9.3.2.1. (Added-920RQW) Current items tracked in PEX as FCIF items include (not
     limited to): FCIF B read file, FCIF C read file, boldface, init/annual read file review,
     publication issue (flight), Safety read file, semi-annual test accomplishment, and OPS
     SUP/SDO read file.
     9.3.2.2. (Added-920RQW) Aircrew/team members will be displayed by a colored dot
     indicating his/her current status in each column. ―Red‖ indicates that an aircrew member
     cannot fly until the current items are confirmed accomplished and/or signed off in PEX.
     A yellow status indicates that a crewmember is overdue a currency or needs to sign off a
     non-grounding item, but may still fly with proper supervision or sortie profile. A ―green‖
     status indicates that all Go/No-go items for that column are satisfied, cleared to fly.
     9.3.2.3. (Added-920RQW) Current Aeronautical Order, Flight Physical, Physiological
     Training, Physical Availability (DNIF) will always need to be checked manually using
     the ARMS reports regardless of PEX implementation.
     9.3.2.4. (Added-920RQW) As a positive control measure, the OPS SUP/SDO will
     review the No-go status of all aircrew members prior to the mission brief and resolve any
     discrepancies prior to aircrew members stepping to the aircraft. If PEX is not available,
     the most current ARMS products will be used.
88                                      AFI11-202V2_920RQWSUP_I 24 FEBRUARY 2010


        9.3.2.5. (Added-920RQW) In addition, the OPS SUP/SDO will review the OPS
        SUP/SDO Currency Report for training items/currencies (non-grounding) that may affect
        mission profiles. If PEX is not available, the most current ARMS products will be used.
        9.3.2.6. (Added-920RQW) Backup Procedures. Units will maintain paper copy of all
        FCIF Read File items. In the event of PEX failure, or password problems when signing
        off PEX FCIF items, an aircrew may document FCIF accomplishment by indicating ―thru
        FCIF XX-XX‖ in the remarks section of the flight authorization. In the event that the
        local PEX system is not available, the flight authorization system will be used to
        document FCIF Go/No-go status.
        9.3.2.7. (Added-920RQW) Other Requirements. Each flight will fill out an ORM sheet
        prior to the OPS SUP/SDO briefing. The OPS SUP/SDO is responsible for getting the
        appropriate supervisor approval if required. Although this is a pre-flight item, the ORM
        sheet is not a Go/No-go item.
     9.3.3. (Added-920RQW) Prior to each flight, aircraft commanders will check their crew’s
     Go/No-go status and flight leads will confirm the status of all flight members. The OPS
     SUP/SDO, DO, and one Commanding Officer (CO) also have redundant responsibilities to
     ensure Go/No-go status so that no aircrew/team member flies ―in the red‖. Training items
     accomplished, but not yet entered in ARMs (i.e. red on the ARMS Currency Report or under
     the training column when implemented in PEX) must be verified accomplished by asking the
     aircraft commander or instructor. Document training event accomplishments on an IMT
     1522 or in the remarks section of the Flight Authorization prior to the OPS SUP/SDO brief.
9.4. Electronic Data Storage Units may use electronic database files for record keeping, trend
analysis, printing of standard forms, etc. MAJCOMs will establish standards for archiving and
inspection of electronic files. Units not in compliance will maintain hard-copy records as
directed in this instruction.

recommended changes to Air Force flying-related publications at each command level. Unless
different guidance is provided by the appropriate AF publication OPR, submit recommended
changes and improvements to Air Force publications on AF Form 847 according to the
procedures below and in AFI 11-215, Attachment 3 (covering completion of the form). Submit
recommended changes for conditions that have negative effects on operational efficiency, to
correct content errors or to recommend improved procedures or processes. Do not use the AF
Form 847 to call attention to typographical, printing or quality errors unless they cause
misinterpretation. Such deficiencies can be remedied by direct communication with the AF
publication OPR.
A9.2. Processing AF Forms 847.
   A9.2.1. Submit and process all AF Forms 847 through MAJCOM channels as outlined in the
   MAJCOM supplement to this instruction, in accordance with routing as outlined in Figure
   A9.1 and in compliance with instructions in AFI 11-215, Attachment 3. ANG units will
   utilize the NAF/MAJCOM command structure with oversight responsibility. Units will
   submit AF Forms 847 electronically to the maximum extent possible.
   A9.2.2. At each level the stan/eval function will document receipt of original AF Forms 847,
   ensure the AF Form 847 reaches the appropriate functional OPR at that level for review,
   forward approved original AF Forms 847 to the next command level while informing the
   preceding command level of disposition (positive and negative) with comments. The advent
   of electronic Forms 847 may allow each level to inform all levels below (including the
   originator) of such disposition. The goal is to keep each command level and the originator
   advised of the progress and disposition of a submitted AF Form 847.
   A9.2.3. The parent MAJCOM of the originator will forward the reviewed original AF Form
   847 to the AF publication OPR. Once the AF publication OPR decides on disposition of the
   AF Form 847, the AF publication OPR will notify the submitting, parent MAJCOM as to
   disposition. The parent MAJCOM will then inform the lower command levels of the
   disposition of the original AF Form 847.
   A9.2.4. The parent MAJCOM of the originator will simultaneously forward information
   copies of AF Forms 847 to all other MAJCOMs that utilize the subject AF publication. The
   other using MAJCOMs may forward comments on the information AF Form 847 suggestions
   to the AF publication OPR.
   A9.2.5. An AF Form 847 may be disapproved by any command level reviewing the original
   AF Form 847. All disapproved recommendations will be returned to the submitting
   command level with justification annotated on the AF Form 847 stating the reason for the
   disapproval. Disapproved recommendations are not normally forwarded to other MAJCOMs,
   but may be forwarded for additional considerations if desired. MAJCOMs may address how
   to resubmit an AF Form 847 disapproved at a command level below the AF publication OPR
   in their supplement to this instruction.

   A9.2.6. The movement and disposition of the original AF Form 847 will be tracked by the
   stan/eval function at all command levels that review the original AF Form 847. There is no
   requirement to track receipt or disposition of information copies of an AF Form 847.
