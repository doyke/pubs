                                           INTRODUCTION

1.1. Overview. Test and Evaluation (T&E) is a risk-reduction tool to use in decision making. This
instruction provides local guidance for a disciplined approach to T&E. Air Force Materiel Command
Instruction (AFMCI) 99-103, Test Management designated WR-ALC/ENT as a Center Test Authority
(CTA). WR-ALC/ENT is available to provide test planning guidance and management assistance
throughout the test process.

1.2. Purpose. This instruction outlines the process for testing conducted by or for WR-ALC. The process
is designed to manage the technical and safety risk inherent in T&E. As a result of implementing this pro-
cess, technical, safety, funding, and scheduling risks may be reduced.

1.3. Applicability
    1.3.1. The procedures outlined in this instruction apply to all sustainment and acquisition efforts for
    which WR-ALC has management or technical responsibility for the test project. This includes tests
    conducted for WR-ALC organizations involving non-Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) organi-
    zations.
    1.3.2. WR-ALC has management and technical responsibility when a proposed test involves the eval-
    uation of designs, modifications, upgrades, or changes that fall under the management responsibility
    of the group commanders within WR-ALC.
    1.3.3. Activities that are a normal part of the depot maintenance function (i.e. routine Functional
    Check Flights (FCFs), Acceptance Check Flights (ACFs), Unprogrammed Depot Level Maintenance
    (UDLM), or engine runs after Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM)) are not governed by this
    instruction. FCF and ACF missions specifically required in a test plan as part of an approved test
    project are governed by this instruction.

                                              Chapter 5

                                          ITT PROCESSES

5.1. Authority/ITT Charter. The ITT will develop a formal charter IAW AFI 99-103, Capabilities
Based Test and Evaluation, paragraph 4.4.5.
   5.1.1. The group commander will designate a representative from his or her group to co-chair the ITT.
   The roles of TEWG representative and ITT chairperson may be assigned to the same person.
   5.1.2. The membership will author the charter, and describe team membership, responsibilities,
   resources, and products for which the ITT is responsible. An example ITT charter is located in
   Attachment 2 of this Instruction.
   5.1.3. The group commander will approve and sign the ITT charter.
   5.1.4. The ITT will review and update the ITT charter annually.

5.2. Operational Test & Evaluation (OT&E) Co-chair Designation:
   5.2.1. For each project requiring testing, the group’s ITT co-chair is responsible for contacting AFO-
   TEC to determine if they will serve as the ITT’s OT&E co-chair.
   5.2.2. If AFOTEC does not participate, the ITT will keep a Memorandum for Record (MFR) noting
   the decision. The MFR should include AFOTEC’s recommendation of which operational MAJCOM
   OT&E organization should participate in AFOTEC’s place.
   5.2.3. The group’s ITT co-chair is responsible for contacting the operational MAJCOM’s test organi-
   zation to determine if they will serve as the ITT co-chair, if applicable.
   5.2.4. If neither AFOTEC nor an operational MAJCOM will serve as the ITT’s OT&E co-chair, the
   ITT will keep an MFR documenting the decision.

5.3. Responsible Test Organization (RTO) Designation Process :
   5.3.1. An RTO is designated for every test project unless waived by the approval authority.
   5.3.2. Once the ITT identifies a test requirement, the ITT, CTA, and TESTREP will work together to
   identify an appropriate RTO or develop justification to waive the RTO requirement. The CTA will
   document the recommendation on an RTO Designation/Waiver Form (WR-ALC Form 50) and for-
   ward it to the RTO designation/waiver approval authority. An organization may be designated as the
   RTO for multiple closely related projects on the same WR-ALC Form 50 (a “blanket” RTO designa-
   tion). Similarly, the RTO requirement may be waived for multiple closely related projects on the same
   WR-ALC Form 50 (a “blanket” RTO waiver). A blanket RTO designation or waiver is valid for one
   year after approval.
   5.3.3. The RTO designation/waiver approval authority is the PEO. If the Project does not fall under a
   PEO, the approval authority is the WR-ALC/CC (or their designee). The RTO designation/waiver
   request will be endorsed by WR-ALC/EN before going to the approval authority.
   5.3.4. The CTA will forward a courtesy copy of RTO designation/waiver approvals to the following
   organizations:

                    TEMPLATE: INTEGRATED TEST TEAM (ITT) CHARTER

A2.1. The ITT Charter
This is a suggested outline of primary subject areas for an ITT charter. The charter should briefly cite
information necessary to understand the efforts conducted for its sustainment or maintenance group and
how the ITT will support that sustainment or maintenance group. Each ITT participant’s roles and respon-
sibilities should be cited. This list is not inclusive and may be expanded to include additional information
necessary to understand what the ITT will do. ITT charters should be brief and avoid repeating informa-
tion readily available in other documents.

A2.2. Template.
1.0. Introduction
1.1. Sustainment or Maintenance Efforts Covered. List the sustainment or maintenance effort(s) the
ITT will oversee. If the ITT originated with an acquisition program and is being maintained for that pro-
gram as a sustainment effort, give a brief history of the ITT since the initial Acquisition Decision Memo-
randum (ADM).
1.2. Authority. Cite the documents directing the formation of the ITT and its responsibilities.
1.2.1. AFMCI 99-103.
1.2.2. RAFBI 99-103.
1.3. Sustainment or Maintenance Effort Description. Briefly describe the effort(s) covered by this
charter.
2.0. ITT Mission, Scope, and Overarching Goals. The ITT is responsible for the overarching T&E
strategies and policies for its sustainment or maintenance group. The ITT maintains test oversight of all
modifications, acquisitions, sustainment efforts, and other projects for the sustainment or maintenance
group.
3.0. ITT Membership. Describe who the “core” members are.
3.1. Sustainment/Maintenance Group. The group commander will delegate a representative to co-chair
the ITT. The designation will occur through a separate letter of appointment, and the representative’s
name or office symbol does not need to be included in the ITT charter.
3.2. Operational Test Organization. The group commander will create a relationship with an opera-
tional test organization through a memorandum of agreement to support the group’s ITT. In accordance
with AFI 99-103 and RAFBI 99-103, the first choice is the AFOTEC. If AFOTEC declines to serve on the
ITT, they should document it in a formal letter to the group commander, which will be filed with the ITT
charter. If AFOTEC declines participation in the ITT, the appropriate MAJCOM or operational test
agency (OTA) should serve the ITT as a co-chair. If the MAJCOM or appropriate OTA declines to partic-
ipate, they should also document their decision in a formal letter to the group commander, which will be
filed with the ITT charter. If neither AFOTEC, MAJCOM nor OTA choose to participate in the ITT, they
must realize the ITT will operate without OT&E insight.
22                                                               ROBINSAFBI99-103 12 MARCH 2008


3.3. Center Test Authority (CTA). The WR-ALC CTA will be a member of each ITT. This allows the
CTA to maintain insight into all test activities occurring at or for WR-ALC. The CTA is the focal point for
all test issues at WR-ALC.
3.4. Other Members. The group commander or any of the ITT members may request additional member-
ship in the ITT. Permanent members to the ITT should be documented in the charter.
4.0. ITT Responsibilities. Building on the list of responsibilities in AFI 99-103 and RAFBI 99-103, list
the responsibilities that are unique to this ITT and program. Some of the responsibilities include:
4.1. Group T&E Activities. Maintain knowledge of all projects within the group which require or may
require test and evaluation.
4.2. Quarterly Test Status Report (QTSR). Provide test project status information to the WR-ALC CTA
after each CY quarter (NLT than the third Monday of each January, April, July, and August) in accordance
with RAFBI 99-103. The information will be current as of the last day of the applicable CY quarter.
4.3. Identify Test Requirements. Evaluate modifications, acquisitions, sustainment efforts, and other
projects to determine if they require test and evaluation. If they require testing, define an overall test
objective or purpose, prioritize the testing against other test requirements in the group, and initiate the
RTO designation process.
4.4. Responsible Test Organization (RTO) Designation. An RTO is designated for every test project
unless waived by the approval authority, defined in RAFBI 99-103. The ITT will work with the CTA and
WR-ALC TESTREP to identify the most appropriate RTO for the test effort.
5.0. Frequency and Purpose of Meetings. Outline the frequency of meetings, required attendance, and
the ITT procedures for meeting minutes and action items.
6.0. ITT Charter Updates. The ITT will review and update ITT charters annually, IAW RAFBI 99-103.
7.0. Signatures. The level of signature should generally be at the division chief or group commander or

         PROPOSED TEST AND EVALUATION (T&E) WORKING GROUP CHARTER


1. Purpose:
The Test and Evaluation (T&E) Working Group serves as a forum for the designated group-level test
points of contact to discuss a broad range of test issues related to policy, process, training, and infrastruc-
ture issues for the programs/projects and workforce at the WR-ALC. This forum will serve as an effective
mechanism to address and resolve test issues across the wings and between the staff offices and the wings.
Topics briefed/discussed will be for informational and decision making purposes. The goal is to increase
communication, T&E awareness, and provide a forum to work common T&E policy/processes. In addi-
tion, this forum will provide a means to highlight requirements for new T&E infrastructure. If appropri-
ate, decisions and/or issues will be sponsored to the Engineering Advisory Board and subsequently the
Executive Council. All other actions will be the result of the decision process within the T&E Working
Group.
2. Background:
WR-ALC/ENT is designated the Center Test Authority (CTA). The CTA is required by AFMCI 99-103
and is responsible for advising the Center Commander, Staff, and Sustainment Wings on T&E policy/
issues. The CTA will oversee the Center’s test processes & coordinating T&E resources. In order to effec-
tively work issues regarding T&E for WR-ALC, a working group identified within each group-level orga-
nization is needed. This working group fits within the WR-ALC corporate board structure. Issues and
requirements would flow from this working group to the Engineering Advisory Board first, then to the
Executive Council for approval.
3. Oversight:
The T&E Working Group works with and receives guidance directly from the Chief, Center Test Author-
ity (ENT).
4. Scope:
The T&E Working Group will apply a center perspective to address and resolve T&E issues and work-
force management/development concerns. Topics that will be discussed include, but are not limited to the
following:
       - Center-wide T&E policies and processes
       - T&E in Operational Safety, Suitability, and Effectiveness (OSS&E)
       - Force development, training, and T&E awareness
       - T&E infrastructure and requirements
       - Ongoing and new T&E programs
5. Goals:
       a. Establish/Improve T&E policies and processes (update local instructions)
       b. Increase T&E awareness within the workforce
