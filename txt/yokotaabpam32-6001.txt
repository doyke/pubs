Welcome to Yokota Air Base (AB) Family Housing (FH). We are pleased to have you with
us and hope your stay is pleasant. This pamphlet outlines Air Force housing resident
responsibilities for your home and neighborhood. While this pamphlet does not fully cover
all items of interest, it does highlight the more important resident issues. This pamphlet
was designed to enable you to be a partner in our journey to build a thriving housing
community at Yokota AB.

We want our families to have the best possible living conditions. Unlike many Air Force bases,
we at Yokota work and live in very close quarters. This means we must accommodate our
neighbors and work together to maintain a peaceful community. We appreciate your active
adherence to the standards of living on Team Yokota’s base housing. Your support and
adherence enables our team to improve the quality of life for our families while we seamlessly
execute Team Yokota’s numerous missions.

                                           Chapter 2

                              RESIDENT RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. Compliance: Residents are responsible for complying with established policies and
standards while residing in government quarters and are expected to maintain their areas of
responsibility during their tour. Residents will be held liable for occupant caused damages prior
to terminating their quarters or prior to final clearance for non-compliance or for failure to
maintain their areas of responsibility.
2.2. Leave or Extended Temporary Duty (TDY): When you plan to be away from your home
for more than one week, please make arrangements for security, prudent care, and periodic
inspections of your quarters. Please notify the Housing Management Office in writing and your
unit First Sergeant of when you plan to be gone and provide the name and duty phone number of
the individual who will have access to your residence. Also, notify 374 SFS for patrol purposes.
The individual with such access to your quarters must be over 18 years of age and have status of
forces agreement (SOFA) status. Local national personnel cannot assume this responsibility.
2.3. Liability for Damage to Family Housing, Equipment, and Furnishings: Under federal
law, members of the Armed Forces and Civilians occupying FH shall be held liable and
accountable for loss or damage to family housing, equipment or furnishings caused by the abuse
or negligence of the member, the member's dependents or the member's guests. The amount of
liability shall be determined on a case by case basis. Regardless, members are liable for the full
amount of damages or loss in cases of willful misconduct or abuse. AFI 32-6001, Family
Housing Management, provides guidance on responsibility determination and pecuniary liability.
2.4. Insurance: While occupying FH, you are highly encouraged to consider buying
commercial insurance to protect yourself in case of major loss. Your insurance should clearly
state that personal liability coverage for loss or damage involving government quarters,
furnishings, and equipment is included. A common policy for this coverage would be a renter's
policy, which would cover personal property as well as personal liability for government
property. You may be able to obtain liability coverage for government property without insuring
your personal property if you so desire. The government's liability is normally based upon
replacement value, net square footage and grade.
2.5. Damages to Quarters: You may be charged for damages beyond fair wear and tear.
Although you may repair items yourself before terminating your quarters, the repairs or
replacements must meet Air Force standards. Residents are also held responsible for damages
caused by self-help work and required to repair or make restitution prior to final inspection. For
additional information about self-help work, contact the Facilities Section at 225-9099; they will
explain your options to repair or replace damaged items and help you select the method of
payment.
2.6. Energy Conservation:
   2.6.1. Water: Normal and reasonable use of water is expected. Excessive usage results in
   increased costs and depletion of our resources, so please eliminate waste whenever possible.
   Any necessary water restrictions will be published in the Base Bulletin and Commander’s
   Channel 20.
 14                                                  YOKOTAABPAM32-6001 6 JUNE 2012


   2.6.2. Heating and Cooling: Your hot water heater should be set at the normal setting,
   approximately 140 degrees Fahrenheit. This temperature conserves fuel and ensures that
   your family is not scalded by water that is too hot. Heating and air conditioning are operated
   at certain times of the year depending on the number of consecutive days that a certain
   outside temperature is maintained. This information will be disseminated to base residents
   via electronic means (e.g., web pages, e-mail) and/or the Commander’s Channel 20 and
   Armed Forces Network (AFN) radio (AM 810). Use of window air conditioning is
   prohibited except during approved cooling period.
       2.6.2.1. No Heat/No Cool Periods: All heating and air-conditioning systems are
       deactivated for maintenance. These periods are necessary to switch from cooling to
       heating in the beginning of winter (vice-versa for summer) as both systems cannot run in
       parallel. No heat/no cool dates are planned in advance, approved by wing leadership, and
       disseminated through the Commander’s Channel and through your chain of command.
   2.6.3. Electricity: Minimize use of electricity by using appliances and lights properly. Turn
   them off when not needed, especially during our peak demand periods: 1300 to 1600 hours.
   Do not leave exterior lights on during daylight hours.
2.7. Environmental:
   2.7.1. Asbestos and Lead Based Paint (LBP): Asbestos and LBP are present in many
   facilities at Yokota AB, including housing units. Working or living around materials in good
   condition with asbestos or LBP does NOT pose an immediate health risk. However, if these
   materials are disturbed, asbestos or LBP may be released causing an exposure risk. Before
   disturbing building materials, check with the Environmental Office at 225-5440 to make sure
   that asbestos or LBP is not present. The removal of asbestos and LBP should only be
   performed by properly trained personnel.
   2.7.2. Radon: Radon testing is conducted periodically at Yokota AB. Elevated radon levels
   have been found in some buildings in the past. Radon mitigation units are installed at these
   buildings to reduce radon levels to acceptable levels. Do not disable or tamper with the
   radon mitigation units. For more information about radon mitigation system installed in your
   homes, please contact the Environmental Office at 225-5440.
   2.7.3. Mold: Mold is challenging in areas susceptible to prolonged exposure to moisture.
   To prevent the growth of mold, keep areas vulnerable to moisture dry and well ventilated. If
   mold is a problem, clean it up immediately and locate the moisture source. If you are unable
   to locate the moisture source or suspect a mold outbreak, immediately contact CE Customer
   Service at 225-5282 for Garden Units or 225-8452 for Towers and request a maintenance
   personnel to visit your home. For more information about mold and how to prevent growth,
   go to www.epa.gov/mold/.
   2.7.4. Hazardous material and liquids: Batteries, engine oils, engine coolants, car grease,
   and other similar products must not be poured into plumbing, drainage systems, or on the
   ground. (See paragraph 1.8. for proper disposal and recycling). Do not burn leaves or refuse
   at any time.
2.8. Care of Interior:
YOKOTAABPAM32-6001 6 JUNE 2012                                                                       15


    2.8.1. Kitchen: Routine cleanliness is expected to maintain appliances, cabinets, and walls
    in the kitchen. Ovens, broilers, kitchen hoods, and filters should be cleaned daily to prevent
    a fire from grease buildup. Interiors of refrigerators should be cleaned regularly with water
    and baking soda solution, rinsed and dried. The exterior refrigerator door gasket should be
    cleaned frequently to remove grease and grime. Avoid putting fibrous material such as
    onions and celery in garbage disposals, as this can jam the cutting mechanism. Do not put
    grease or oil in garbage disposal because it will solidify in the pipes and cause drain
    problems. Countertops may become marred or scarred by placing hot pots on them or using
    countertops as a cutting board. Use only regular shelf paper in drawers and cupboards.
    Adhesive-backed paper will damage surfaces when removed.
    2.8.2. Bathrooms: Clean walls in the tub and shower area frequently to prevent mildew. Do
    not use bathtub stickers or appliqués as they cause damage and leave permanent stains. Do
    not paint ceramic tile or place nails in the mortar.
    2.8.3. Floors: Excessive water can cause damage to any floor, especially wood. Only
    quality wax removers should be used to prevent wax buildup. Pay special attention to
    corners and baseboards for buildup.
    2.8.4. Carpets: Many housing units come with wall to wall carpet.             Residents are
    responsible for maintaining the carpet. Maintenance includes vacuuming, cleaning, and spot
    cleaning. High traffic areas should be your focus as well as spot removal. Vacuum your
    carpet often, twice a week is preferred. Red wine, red beverages, urine, and blood, etc. can
    cause a permanent stain if not treated immediately. Damages deemed beyond normal wear
    and tear are occupant responsibility and charges could be assessed.
    2.8.5. Wall Penetrations: Use nail or building type hangers only. At termination you are
    responsible for larger holes (over one-half inch in diameter) and their proper repair. Ensure
    door stops are installed to prevent damage to the walls.
    2.8.6. Laminated Doors, Counters: DO NOT use tacks, nails, sticky hangers, borders or any
    type of material with adhesives as they will damage the lamination. You will be responsible
    for damage charges beyond normal wear and tear.
2.9. Insect Control: You are expected to help prevent infestation of insects and rodents in the
home. The 374 CES Pest Management Section will help you with health-related pests such as
fleas, ticks, rats, structural pests, termites or carpenter ants. Aerosols, bait stations, traps and fly
swatters are available through the CE Self Help store at 225-4113.
2.10. Care of Exterior: You are responsible for: exterior appearance based on standards (as
listed in paragraphs 2.11., Grounds Maintenance; 7.9., Awnings, Fences, and Storage Sheds).
Failure to live up to the conditions of occupancy is grounds for removal from base housing.
    2.10.1. Windows: You are responsible for exterior cleaning of first floor windows only.
    Some window styles on second floors may be removable for cleaning. Tower residents, see
    Chapter 10.
    2.10.2. Grounds and Yard Responsibilities: Occupants are responsible for maintaining
    grounds within 100 feet of their unit and half the distance to the next building. Pruning and
    trimming of bushes and shrubs less than 8 feet are the occupant’s responsibility;
    anything above 8 feet will be the contractor’s responsibility. Your assigned parking areas
 16                                                   YOKOTAABPAM32-6001 6 JUNE 2012


   are your responsibility to keep clean and control weeds. Do not allow grass cuttings or
   leaves to accumulate in the street or parking area. This accumulation could enter the storm
   drains and increase the potential for flooding. Edging is also the resident’s responsibility to
   keep sidewalks clear of migrating grass and weeds. Grass cuttings will be collected or
   mulched in a way to not produce excessive visible clumps in the yard. The base maintains
   designated common areas throughout FH. The contractor’s areas and occupant areas of
   responsibility will be briefed during initial assignment of FH. If you need clarification of
   what your responsibility is, please contact the Housing Management Office, Facility Office at
   225-9099. Seed and fertilizer are available for you at the CE Self Help store, Bldg 933, on a
   seasonal basis. Contact the CE Self Help store, 225-4113, for more information.
   2.10.3. Appearance Inspections: Every occupant is expected to maintain his/her lawn.
   Inspections are based on established standards. Failure to comply with standards may result
   in disciplinary action. Non-compliance after receiving three inspection discrepancy
   notices or gross abuse of government property may be just cause for terminating
   government quarters and/or disciplinary action. If on-base housing is terminated for cause,
   off-base housing may be at the resident’s expense.
2.11. Grounds Maintenance Standards for FH:
   2.11.1. The Housing Management Office conducts inspections every Tuesday in all housing
   areas.
   2.11.2. Grass Mowing, Edging and Trimming: This will be accomplished as necessary to
   maintain a neat appearance. Grass will be maintained between 2 – 4 inches in even height.
   Edge sidewalks and roadways to maintain a neat appearance. Digging trenches are
   prohibited. All grass will be removed from cracks and crevices in sidewalks, parking spaces,

                                     FIRE PROTECTION

3.1. Fire Reporting: If a fire occurs in your home, vacate the quarters then call the base fire
department at 911. Give your name, address, phone number, location, and description of fire.
Do not hang up the phone until the operator acknowledges receipt of all information. Ensure all
occupants have evacuated the building and everyone is accounted for in your family. Report any
fire, regardless of size, even if it is extinguished.
3.2. Fire Evacuation Plan: Develop a fire evacuation plan and practice "EDITH" (Exit Drills
in the Home) monthly. The plan should be made with primary and alternate routes of escape in
the event of a fire. Establishing and practicing your escape plan with your family could save the
lives of your loved ones. If a fire occurs at your unit, and as part of the evacuation plan, notify
the fire department responding crews of any disabled family members in the unit and provide the
accountability status of all dependents.
3.3. Housekeeping: Keep garbage from accumulating in closets, storage areas, near attics, wall
heaters, and doorways. Clean clothes dryer, lint traps and vent hoses regularly. Check the rear,
bottom and sides of large major appliances for dust accumulation, spilled flammable or
combustible liquids, and garbage that may impede the safe operation of appliances. Good
housekeeping and cleanliness is synonymous with good fire prevention awareness.
3.4. Cooking Appliances: Never leave cooking unattended. In the event of a fire, cover the
burning pan/pot with a lid, turn off the appliance, and call 911. NEVER use water to try to put
out the fire! DO NOT attempt to move the pan/pot, doing so may cause the fire to spread or
cause burns/injury to you. The range hood exhaust fan should be used any time you are cooking.
Clean the exhaust fan filter, hood assembly, and stove often to prevent the accumulation of
grease.
3.5. Gasoline Powered Equipment: Gasoline powered equipment should be properly stored.
Do not refuel equipment while it is still running. A maximum of five (5) gallons of gasoline may
be stored in containers approved by Underwriters Laboratory (UL), or Factory Manual. Gasoline
shall be stored OUTSIDE the home in a secured storage area (no more than 5 gallons). Gasoline
is authorized for storage in the garden and single story housing unit.
3.6. Kerosene/Electric Space Heaters: Kerosene heaters are prohibited in Yokota AB FH
units. Use UL-listed or host nation equivalent space heaters equipped with automatic shut-off
devices that will shut off the heater if it tips over. Space heaters should also have an overheat
protection device and an automatic thermostat control and will be disconnected when not in use.
Always plug space heaters directly into a wall receptacle. Never plug space heaters into multiple
outlet strips or extension cord and never leave space heaters unattended. Keep portable heaters
at least 18 inches away from all combustibles.
3.7. Smoke Detectors: The occupant of each FH unit is responsible for a monthly test,
cleaning, and examination of all household warning devices installed within the quarters.
Inspect the physical appearance of the devices for evidence of damage, abuse, tampering, or
other indications that may render it inoperative. Smoke detector batteries will be replaced as
needed or at least annually. Smoke detectors will also be cleaned in conjunction with the
monthly test or as needed. Any defective detectors should be reported to the Tower Maintenance

       No obvious physical damage, corrosion, leakage, or clogged nozzle.
       Pressure gauge reading or indicator in the operable range or position.
3.9. Candles: Candles can be used to mark special occasions, but also bring fire into your
home. Ensure you put them on a heat resistant surface. Keep them in a proper holder and
position them away from curtains or underneath shelves. Keep the wick trimmed to ¼ inch and
if you have more than one candle burning they should be at least 4 inches apart. Never leave
candles unattended and keep them out of reach of children and pets.
3.10. Smoking: Ensure all smoking material has been extinguished before disposal. Keep
matches and lighters out of the reach of children.
3.11. Electrical Appliances: All unnecessary electrical equipment will be unplugged when not
in use prior to leaving the area. An extension cord or flexible wiring is intended for temporary
use only and is prohibited from use when it is used as a substitute for fixed wiring. Make sure it
does not run through walls, ceilings, floors, doors, or under carpet. Extension cords shall not be
plugged into another extension cord or surge protector. Surge protectors will only be plugged
directly into the wall outlet. Appliances and heat producing items will only be plugged directly
into the wall outlet.

   Nuisance complaints, including excessive barking and invading the privacy of others, must
   be addressed by the owner immediately. You will ensure cleanliness of your pet’s area to
   control and prevent vermin infestation. Feces must be picked up immediately. Dog
   runs are not authorized. Pet doors and/or the practice of leaving a door open to allow a pet to
   enter/leave the residence at will is prohibited. Such practice allows vermin such as rats, mice
   and insects access to the residence. Pet food will also be contained in a manner to minimize
   the attraction of vermin. Unconsumed pet food should be disposed of immediately.
   Unattended dogs must be in an approved fencing area at the back of the quarters only. Stray
   pets should be reported to the 374 SFS, 225-7200.
5.3. Pet Registration: Pets kept by Yokota FH residents must be registered with the base
Veterinary Clinic and maintain current immunization on all pets. Upon completion of a
vaccination, ensure that the Veterinary Clinic sends the Pass and Registration Office one copy of
the DD Form 2208, Rabies and Vaccination Certificate. This form serves as the registration
document. Notify the base veterinarian on any changes in ownership or permanent change of
station (PCS). Dogs and cats are required to wear a collar or harness with current rabies and
distemper vaccination attached. All residents previously housed with three pets will be
grandfathered. All pets will be controlled at all times IAW 374 AWI 34-101 (will be Yokota
ABI 34-101), Control, Care, and Immunization of Pets. All incidents of pet bites and scratches
will be investigated when reported to the 374 SFS.
   5.3.1. Stray and Free-Roaming Animals: 374 AWI 34-101 (will be Yokota ABI 34-101) is
   the Installation Commander’s tool to minimize stray and free-roaming animals. Once stray
   and free-roaming animals have been detained either by the 374 SFS or CE Entomology, they
   are turned over to the Pet Adoption Center. The center will hold animals for five (5) days for
   the reclaiming process. After five days, the animal is either put up for adoption or destroyed.
   5.3.2. Damage by Pets: All damages caused by pets must be repaired, replaced or
   reimbursed by the resident. This responsibility includes reseeding grass areas destroyed by
   an occupant’s pet.
   5.3.3. Violators: Violation of pet control instructions may result in the immediate and
   permanent removal of your pet from government quarters.
   5.3.4. Dog Parks: Dog parks are located in all four areas of housing. It is the owner’s

5.4. Noise Control: Excessive noise is the primary complaint received by the Family Housing
Management Office. Many Yokota personnel work unusual shifts and may be sleeping during
the day. Please be considerate.
   5.4.1. Quiet Hours: Normal quiet hours are observed between the hours of 2200 and 0600
   hours.
   5.4.2. Parties: Many complaints about party noise can be avoided by informing your
   neighbors prior to the event.
   5.4.3. Excessive Stereo/Television Volumes: Please keep the volume down. If you step
   outside of your quarters and you can hear the sound of your television or your stereo, then the
   volume is too loud.
5.5. Control of Children: Know where your children are!
   5.5.1. Supervision: Your children must be closely supervised at all times. Review 374 AWI
   31-201, Curfew and Supervision of Minors, Table 1, Supervision of Minors.
   5.5.2. Playground: For your children’s safety, your neighbor’s yards, streets or parking lots,

                                            Chapter 6

                            SPECIAL CLIMATIC CONDITIONS

6.1. Disaster Preparedness: No one likes to talk about it, but the best way to survive a disaster
is to prepare for it. Unusual weather conditions are announced on the AFN radio (810 AM) and
television (Commander’s Channel 20). Japan is susceptible to a variety of natural disasters,
however, earthquakes and typhoons are the most common.
   6.1.1. Earthquakes: Earthquakes are a very real threat in Japan. They can happen at any
   time and in any season. Japan is situated near a fault line, and is shaken by approximately
   1,000 earthquakes per year that are strong enough to be felt by humans. During and after an
   earthquake the following safety practices should be followed:
       6.1.1.1. Stand in a doorway or crawl under a desk or table to help prevent falling objects
       from hitting you. Be aware of objects that could become falling hazards such as light
       fixtures, hanging pictures and mirrors, or unsecure objects like large televisions.
       6.1.1.2. If in a car, stop the vehicle as quickly and as safely as possible. Be aware of
       power lines, trees, or any other object that could become a falling hazard.
       6.1.1.3. When the quake stops, turn off or unplug electrical appliances and devices.
       Ensure all fire hazards, such as stoves, are turned off. Fire is the single greatest cause of
       loss of life and property during earthquakes.
       6.1.1.4. Inspect your home for structural damage which could cause light fixtures to fall
       from ceilings, cabinets to fall from walls, or even the ceiling or walls to separate from the
       main structure and fall. Be aware of these hazards and inform the members of your
       family so they can avoid those areas of the house during aftershocks. Report any damage
       to the Housing Management Office immediately. If you fear the structural integrity of a
       building, do not enter the building unless cleared by CE.
   6.1.2. Typhoons: Typhoons normally occur from May to November. Yokota forecasts
   normally take us through four conditions as the typhoon comes closer to the base. Tropical
   Cyclone Condition of Readiness 4 (TCCOR 4) is the least serious, usually indicating that the
   typhoon is more than 72 hours away. TCCOR 1 is the most serious, and means the arrival of
   the typhoon at the base is anticipated within 24 hours. You should become familiar with
   precautionary measures you should take via your unit information program or Emergency
   Management Representative. Notification will be made on AFN radio (810 AM) and/or the
   Commander’s Channel 20. When notified of a typhoon forecasted to pass near or directly
   through the Yokota AB area, the following precautions should be taken:
       6.1.2.1. Remove garbage cans and all loose objects such as toys and bicycles from the
       yard, porch, or balcony and store them inside the house or storage room. These objects
       can be picked up by strong winds and driven into or through homes, causing extensive
       property damage and possibly personal injury or loss of life.
       6.1.2.2. Ensure you store a sufficient supply of drinking and cooking water to last as long
       as three to four days, as water distribution systems may become damaged or
       contaminated. Check to ensure you have a sufficient stock of canned goods.

     6.1.2.3. Remember, a power outage is highly possible, and many foods will spoil without
     proper refrigeration. If a power outage has occurred, do not eat any perishable foods that
     may have spoiled as a result. Also be aware that base water systems rely on electricity to
     run various pumps. Although you may have water immediately after a power outage,
     water storage tanks will eventually drain without electricity to run the pumps. Once this
     happens, you will not have running water. Conserve water as much as possible in the
     event of a power outage.
     6.1.2.4. Typhoons can also cause flash flooding. Do not leave vehicles unattended in the
     basement driveway of tower apartments. Do not wade into any flooded area. Maintain
     awareness of weather conditions before they become severe by listening to
     announcements on the AFN radio (810 AM) and Commander’s Channel 20.

7.1. Yard Sales: Family housing residents may conduct three (3) yard sales per year in their
own yards. Requests for permission to conduct yard sales are available at the Housing

                                   TERMINATION OF FH

9.1. The responsibility for final clearance for FH rests solely with the resident.
9.2. Giving Notice: We require a minimum of 40 days notice prior to vacating your quarters.
When you notify us, we will schedule your pre-final and final inspections. You do not need
orders to schedule a pre-final. However, a final inspection cannot be scheduled until you have a
firm port call date. Contact the Housing Management Office at 225-9258 or 225-8636 for
appointments. Ask the Housing Management Office about availability of FH and community
housing at your next base.
9.3. Temporary Lodging Allowance (TLA): Contact the Housing Management Office, 225-
9258, for current TLA information. To minimize the number of TLA days for families PCSing
out of Yokota, loaner furniture can be arranged by calling the FMO, 225-9114. Loaner pots and

                                          Chapter 10

                                   TOWER APARTMENTS

10.1. General: This chapter was designed specifically for tower residents due to the unique
features of high rise apartments. However, the preceding sections of this pamphlet also apply to
your quarters. Please take the time to familiarize yourself with the entire pamphlet. Residing in
a housing apartment differs significantly from conditions encountered in other types of FH.
Above all, it requires much more consideration for the welfare of others, as you will have
neighbors above, below, and next to you. The cooperation of all residents in abiding by the
established rules of conduct set forth in this chapter is an absolute necessity. When you observe
the Golden Rule of "DO UNTO OTHERS AS YOU WOULD HAVE THEM DO UNTO YOU,"
you can ensure better living conditions and a more comfortable, enjoyable period of occupancy.
Please remember to honor your Tower Mayor Program and get to know your assigned Tower
Mayor for your specific Tower.
10.2. Operations/Maintenance and Repairs: A Contractor operated Customer Service desk,
open 24-hours, has been established in Tower 4300. The DSN phone number is 225-8452. After
normal duty hours, only emergency service calls (broken water lines, utility failure, etc.) can be
answered and resolved right away due to the limited number of maintenance personnel available.
Routine maintenance service calls (inoperative washer or dryer, oven, etc.) received after duty
hours are treated as urgent or routine service depending on the scope of repairs. See paragraph
1.4. for estimated time of completion for urgent and routine service calls. Custodial services for
all public areas (garbage room, hallways, elevators, roof, driveways, and parking lots) are
accomplished on a scheduled basis.
10.3. Fire Protection Features:
   10.3.1. Stand Pipe Systems: These are located under each fire alarm push station.
   Instructions for their use are posted on the doors housing them.
   10.3.2. Fire Alarms: If you are unable to contact the Fire Department by telephone to report
   a fire, go to one of the manual fire reporting stations that are provided on each floor in the
   halls. These fire alarm stations are identified by a red light just above them. When activated,
   the alarm station will alert all residents on that floor, and the floor above, and will send an
   alarm to the fire department. To ensure that the fire department is notified by the alarm
   system, follow up with a phone call to 911.
   10.3.3. Heat Detectors/Smoke Detectors: Each apartment is equipped with heat detectors
   attached to the ceiling of each room. These devices are designed to automatically activate
   the fire alarm system when the temperature reaches a certain degree or when there is a
   sudden rise in temperature. In addition to heat detectors, each apartment has one single
   station smoke detector in the hallway leading to the bedrooms. These smoke detectors are
   not tied into the building fire alarm system. Should one activate due to a fire, notify the fire
   department immediately. Smoke detectors must be tested monthly to ensure they are
   operational. If the smoke detector is inoperative, phone in an emergency call to the Tower
   Maintenance Customer Service, 225-8452, for repairs. Some towers are equipped with
   automatic sprinkler systems in the apartments and others only have them in the basement
 34                                                   YOKOTAABPAM32-6001 6 JUNE 2012


   garbage room. These systems are temperature sensitive and will activate with sudden
   increases in temperature.
   10.3.4. Fire Doors: Automatically closing fire doors are on each floor at the stairway exit.
   These doors are kept in the open position by an electromagnetic device. In the event of fire
   or smoke, they move to a closed position by means of smoke detectors installed above them
   and shut off the stairway exit from smoke and fire.
10.4. Fire Evacuation: As soon as the fire alarm system sounds, all residents will evacuate
their quarters through the emergency fire escape located on the north, south, east, and west sides
of each tower. You can gain access to the fire escape through the bedroom balcony door of your
apartment. Doors to the fire escape should never be blocked nor should any device be used to
keep them in the open position. Towers are designed to provide the safest means of evacuation
for all occupants from any floor level. Even though the fire escapes are the safest means of
evacuation from the tower apartments, you can safely use the main stairway as an alternate
means of evacuation. However, there will be fire fighters and other emergency personnel using
it to get to the scene of a fire, so be careful. Lighted exit signs and emergency lighting are
provided at each floor level to show the exit direction and to keep the way lighted in the event of
electrical power failure. The emergency lighting system will only be effective for approximately
45 minutes. Keep a flashlight readily available in your car and home for use when extended
power outages occur.
10.5. Do Not Use the Elevator as a Fire Exit: When the fire alarm system is activated, the
elevators automatically return to the first floor FOR USE BY FIRE DEPARTMENT
PERSONNEL ONLY.
10.6. Fire Lanes: Do not park in the driveway entrance of any tower apartment. These areas
are to be used strictly for emergency, service or government vehicles on official business. All
other parking is prohibited.
10.7. Recycling and Refuse Collection: Garbage shall be taken in tied plastic garbage bags to
the garbage room located on the basement floor. Parents should ensure that children who take
garbage to the garbage room can sort a full garbage bag and thoroughly understand that
recyclables and non-recyclables are to be placed in the proper receptacles in the garbage room.
Do not leave the garbage in the hallways, stairways, garbage room entrance or elevators.
10.8. Resident Responsibilities: Tower apartment residents have basically the same
responsibilities as residents of other family housing. See Chapter 2, Resident Responsibilities.
All residents are responsible for ensuring that the interior hallways and walls are free of dirt,
stains, paper, and debris. When you notice maintenance or repair requirements (e.g., broken exit
lights) report them immediately to the Tower Maintenance Service Desk at DSN 225-8452.
10.9. Vandalism: Report vandalism to the 374 SFS immediately 225-4357.
10.10. House Rules: Sponsors are responsible at all times for the conduct and decorum of their
family members and guests. The following rules of occupancy for the tower apartments are
established to make a pleasant, safe, convenient, and well ordered living environment for all.
You and your guests are bound by these rules and by standards of reasonable conduct whether or
not included in these guidelines.
   10.10.1. Resident Will:
YOKOTAABPAM32-6001 6 JUNE 2012                                                                 35


       10.10.1.1. Protect the rights and comfort of others. Adjust volume of any musical
       instrument, radio, television or stereo equipment so it does not disturb others. Strict
       quiet hours are from 2200 to 0600 hours. Standard quiet hours are in place from 0600
       to 2200 hours.
       10.10.1.2. Ensure your child do not create disturbances or become a nuisance to others.
       The following activities are prohibited for the sake of courtesy, safety, and building
       upkeep: noisy playing, running, wrestling, throwing/bouncing balls, skate boarding,
       roller skating, and riding of toy vehicles, bicycles or tricycles in the hallway, lobby,
       basement, apartment, and driveway.
       10.10.1.3. In addition to preceding rules, certain offenses could result in eviction on the
       first notice:
           10.10.1.3.1. Vandalism to any portion of the facility.
           10.10.1.3.2. Tampering with or damaging the elevators.
           10.10.1.3.3. Tampering with or damaging fire protection devices/equipment.
           10.10.1.3.4. Throwing anything from the balconies.
Note: Report the above violations immediately to the 374 SFS; DSN 225-4357.
10.11. Storage Rooms: Shared storage rooms will be used for items stored for semiannual or
annual use. Individual storage areas for each apartment are available in all towers. Government
furnished items (i.e., doors, carpets, appliances or hazardous materials), bikes, personal
appliances and/or furniture and flammables will not be stored in tower storage rooms. All
personal items put in the storage room will be marked with the resident’s name and apartment
number. Items that are not identified will be removed and disposed of by housing inspectors.
10.12. Bicycle and Motorcycle Pavilions: Each tower has a bicycle pavilion for use by the
occupants. Motorcycles may be parked in designated area of the pavilion and the owner must
provide protection under the vehicle to protect the cement from any oil/grease drips and cover to
protect children from burns. Bikes must be secured to the rack with a chain and padlocked to
prevent theft. All bicycles and motor-bikes must be removed from the pavilion prior to final
termination inspection.
10.13. Hallways, Sidewalks, Entrances, Driveways, Lobbies, Elevators, and
Stairways: Nothing, with the exception of a small throw rug, may be placed at your front door
in the hallways of the towers. Shoes, umbrellas, bicycles, strollers, etc., must be brought inside
the apartment. These areas will not be obstructed by any resident, nor used for any purpose other
than entering or exiting the building. Skateboarding, roller-skating, roller-blading, bicycling or
other sliding devices are not authorized in these areas.
10.14. Elevators: Elevators shall only be used to transport you and your family to and from
your apartment. Children will not be allowed to play in them. Elevators are equipped with
motion detectors that will cause them to shut down in case of earthquakes. Children or adults
causing excess motion will activate the motion detectors and stop the elevator. Each elevator has
an emergency call button that is tied directly into the tower maintenance office. If the elevator
malfunctions, push the call button and advise the service call desk of the situation. Caution your
children not to play with this call button. Pets are never allowed in an elevator. Tower
occupants must use the stairs to transport pets.

10.15. Balconies: Each apartment has two balconies, one adjacent to the living room area and
the other adjacent to the master bedroom. Children are not allowed to play on the balconies.
The master bedroom balcony is a fire escape exit only. Do not store anything on this landing or
in the stairway. Placing any item on balcony edges, such as plants, is prohibited due to the
potential hazard of pots/plants falling off. Secure all items placed on balconies so they are not
blown off by high winds. Tires may not be stored on balconies or in the emergency fire exits.
Items stored on balconies should not be visible from the street. Do not hang anything from a
window or balcony. Do not shake rugs or mops out of a window or balcony, nor sweep dust,
rubbish, or litter from any unit into a balcony or common-use area.
10.16. Tower Rooftops: The rooftop is OFF LIMITS to all occupants and visitors. The tower
roofs are not designed for public use. Roof membranes and surface coverings were designed
solely for weather and maintenance traffic; only authorized maintenance and emergency
response personnel are allowed access. Additional reasons for residents to stay away from the
tower rooftops are: fire protection/suppression equipment is not installed, there are no adequate
fire exits, limits the danger to residents (prevents suicide attempts, children and pets falling), and
(without means to monitor access to the Rooftops) limits the occurrence of vandalism.
10.17. Car Wash: Wash cars by using a bucket or nozzle equipped hose only in the designated
car wash area of the basement driveway. Vehicle (including motorcycle) maintenance and
repairs are prohibited in housing areas, including the tower areas. Please use the Auto Hobby
Shop for all car maintenance (i.e., oil change, brake fluid change, etc)
10.18. Shopping Carts: Return shopping carts to the basement floor immediately after use.
Twenty-minute parking is authorized in the basement driveway to allow you to take your
groceries up to the apartment, return the cart to the basement, and remove your car to the parking
lot. Do not leave the cart in your apartment, hallway or elevator, as this practice will hinder your
escape in case of a fire and will inconvenience your neighbors.
10.19. Parking: Parking is restricted to the parking lot only. Under no circumstance will more
than one four-wheel vehicle of any type be parked in one parking space. All vehicles must be
centered within the white lines. Parking in the front entrance drive-through is prohibited except
for loading and unloading passengers and at no time will a vehicle be left unattended.
10.20. Power Outage: During a power outage, emergency lighting in the towers will last for

conservation is critical during power outages as the pumps that feed the rooftop gravity tanks

of water to only essential purposes. Laundry machines and dishwashing machines should not be
run and residents should limit bathing/showering.
