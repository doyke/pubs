                                           Chapter 2

                                      TRAVEL POLICY

2.1. Basic Travel Considerations. The LGRD or the (contracted) Commercial Travel Office
(CTO) makes official travel arrangements and provides reservations and ticketing for all
uniformed service members, Department of Defense (DoD) civilian employees, their family
members and non-DoD personnel when travel orders authorize travel and transportation.
   2.1.1. The primary consideration when arranging official travel is to satisfy mission
   requirements as determined by the Authorizing/Order-Issuing Official (AO) following DoD
   and Air Force transportation and travel policies. Each traveler, including all infants, must be
   issued a ticket and provided a seat on all conveyances.
   2.1.2. Official Travel. IAW JFTR/JTR Appendix A for Travel, Official: Official travel may
   be performed within or in the vicinity of a permanent duty station (PDS); to or from the
   actual residence; to, from, or between PDS; and to, from, at, and between temporary duty
   (TDY) locations.
2.2. DoD Approved Carriers. DoDD 4500.53, DoD Commercial Air Transportation Quality
and Safety Review Program, requires the DoD to procure commercial air transportation services
from air carriers approved by the DoD Commercial Airlift Review Board (CARB), HQ
AMC/A3B, unit 3A1, 402 Scott Drive, Scott AFB IL, 62269-5302, DSN 779-4801, Commercial
(618) 229-4801.
   2.2.1. The CARB is authorized by law to make decisions regarding the temporary non-use or
   permanent suspension of an air carrier in the DoD Air Transportation Program. HQ
   AMC/A3B maintains a listing of DoD approved and suspended air carriers. The listing is
   updated/released quarterly via message to all LGRDs. A current listing may be obtained at:
   https://private.amc.af.mil/a3/default.aspx?div=a34b LGRD/CTO must review the listing
   before making commercial air travel arrangements.
2.3. Order of Precedence for Travel.
   2.3.1. DTR 4500.9-R, Part 1, Chapter 103 directs the LGRD/CTO to use a specific order of
   precedence when making official travel arrangements. Accordingly, the DoD policy, in the
   following priorities, in order of precedence, must be used for passenger airlift:
       2.3.1.1. Headquarters, United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM)-
       contracted airlift (e.g., Patriot Express channel airlift) must be used for OCONUS travel
       unless there is a documented negative critical mission impact.
          2.3.1.1.1. Exceptions are as follows:
              2.3.1.1.1.1. A mission impact statement is provided by the traveler and
              authorized by their unit commander or designee only in commanders‘ absence.
              Use the format at 2.3.1.1.1.1. Global Air Transportation and Execution System
              (GATES) issues a non-availability statement/message for the requested travel
              window.
              2.3.1.1.1.2. No AMC channel, configured for passenger(s), is available. The use
              of Category M on AMC cargo aircraft is not regularly scheduled air passenger
 18                                                              AFI24-101 19 OCTOBER 2012


              service, but may be used if it accomplishes the mission.
              2.3.1.1.1.3. Children at least 10 years old and less than 18 years old as of the date
              of travel will be accepted for unaccompanied Space-Required travel on Patriot
              Express missions if they meet the criteria defined in Air Mobility Command
              Instruction 24-101, Volume 14, Military Airlift Passenger Service.
       2.3.1.2. Scheduled commercial air service contracted through the GSA Airline City Pair
       Program (CPP) contract.
       2.3.1.3. Other U.S. Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) carriers.
       2.3.1.4. DoD-approved, non-CRAF U.S. flag carriers.
       2.3.1.5. Scheduled service on U.S. air carriers that are neither DoD approved nor
       disapproved (for individual travel only).
       2.3.1.6. DoD-approved foreign flag carriers.
       2.3.1.7. Scheduled service on foreign air carriers that are neither DoD-approved nor
       disapproved (for individual travel only).
2.4. U. S. Flag Carriers. Travelers are required to use U.S. flag carriers for travel funded by
the U.S. government. The use of foreign flag carriers is prohibited when U.S. carriers are
available.
   2.4.1. The exception to this requirement is if a U.S. flag carrier ―code share(s)‖ with a
   foreign partner airline. A Code Share Agreement, sometimes simply called Code Share, is
   an aviation business arrangement where two or more airlines share the same flight. A seat
   can be purchased on one airline but is actually operated by a cooperating airline under a
   different flight number or code. Any tickets issued under a code share agreement must show
   the U.S. flag carrier as the ticket issuing authority, and is not considered a foreign carrier (B-
   240956; Sep 25, 1991; 70 Comptroller General 713, 1991). When using code share flights
   involving U.S.-certificated air carriers and non-U.S.-certificated air carriers, the U.S.-
   certificated air carrier flight number must be used on the ticket. If the non-U.S.-certificated
   air carrier flight number is used on the ticket, the ticket is on a non-U.S.-certificated air
   carrier and a non-availability of U.S.-certificated air carrier document is needed See JTR,
   par. C3525, JFTR U3525.
   2.4.2. When the LGRD/CTO determines U.S. flag carriers are not available, including a
   code share partner, foreign carriers may be authorized/approved by the orders
   Authorizing/Order-Issuing Official (AO). See JFTR, par. U3525 and JTR, par. C3525 for
   determining availability and non-availability.
   2.4.3. If it is determined that U.S. flag carriers are not available, documentation explaining
   why a U.S. flag carrier cannot be used must be provided to the traveler and endorsed by the
   AO. The documentation must include the name of the traveler, foreign-flag ship(s) or air
   carrier(s) used, flight identification number(s), origin, destination and enroute points, date(s),
   justification, and authorizing/approving official‘s title, organization and signature.
   2.4.4. The travel order must be annotated reflecting U.S. flag carrier is not available to
   satisfy mission requirements and that a foreign flag carrier was authorized/approved for use.
AFI24-101 19 OCTOBER 2012                                                                            19


   2.4.5. When U.S. flag carriers are available, travelers with prior authorization to personally-
   procure airline tickets (e.g., Leave-in-Conjunction with Official Travel (LICWO) or
   circuitous routing), must be advised not to use foreign flag carriers over segments of their
   travel for which reimbursement for travel must be claimed. Reimbursement is not provided
   (for any leg of the journey) for transportation costs when unauthorized/unapproved foreign
   carriers are used. If U.S. flag carrier service is available for an entire trip and the traveler uses
   a foreign carrier for any part or all of the trip, the transportation cost on the foreign carrier is
   not payable (Code of Federal Regulations, Title 41, Chapter 301, Part 301-10).
2.5. Use of General Services Administration (GSA) Airline City Pair Program (CPP).
   2.5.1. Uniformed service members and DoD employees on official travel are mandatory
   users of the GSA Airline CPP. There are two types of GSA City Pair fares, non-restricted
   City Pair fares (YCA) and capacity controlled City Pair fares (_CA), which are less
   expensive than YCA fares, but have some limitation or restrictions. The _CA fares should be
   used if the restrictions do not hinder mission accomplishment. The LGRD/CTO is required to
   use this program when a City Pair exists between the origin and destination listed in the
   official travel order.
       2.5.1.1. Government contractors and contractor employees are governed by the rules in
       the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 31.205-46. As such, government contractors
       and contractor employees are not government employees and are not eligible, under any
       circumstances, for GSA City Pair airfares, or any travel-related item restricted to
       government employees.
   2.5.2. Government airfares (e.g., GSA City Pair fares - YCA and _CA, air fares offered by
   non-contract carriers at City Pair rates - _DG, international non-contract air fare - MMZ, etc.)
   may be used for official DoD travel only. City Pair fares may not be segmented when a
   through-fare exists, even if it costs less. Constructed YCA and _CA fares may be used when
   there is no through-fare between the origin and destination listed on the official travel orders.
   Unlike YCA and _CA fares, when using other government fares such as YMZ, MMZ, MDG,
   HDG, the use of through or segmented fares may be used to meet mission requirements when
   they provide the overall best value. Some airlines may have restrictions, check with
   appropriate airline carrier for specifics.
   2.5.3. . Exceptions to the use of GSA City Pairs Program can be found in the DTR 4500.9-R,
   Part 1, Ch 103.
   2.5.4. This program is mandatory for group travel up to 10 passengers. For additional
   information on guidance on obtaining group travel arrangements for 10 or more passengers,
   see paragraph 3.2
   2.5.5. When alternate departure/arrival airports are considered see paragraph 3.31, for
   guidance. Note: Use of City Pair fares to or from a leave point is strictly prohibited unless the
   official TDY location and leave point are the same.
2.6. The (Contracted) Commercial Travel Office (CTO). The CTO is a civilian operated
business under contract with the DoD. It furnishes the LGRD a service by providing
transportation and travel services for uniformed service members and DoD employees as
outlined in the scope of the contract and DTR 4500.9-R, Part I, Chapter 102. Use of the CTO for
 20                                                            AFI24-101 19 OCTOBER 2012


official travel is mandatory when the CTO is available. The CTO shall not issue tickets to the
traveler without a valid travel order/authorization or written approval from LGRD/AO.
   2.6.1. While the contract requires CTO employees to be knowledgeable of DoD and Air
   Force transportation and travel policies, LGRD is the final adjudicator on interpreting
   transportation and travel entitlements, analyzing complex transportation issues, and
   furnishing passenger routing determinations, should a conflict exist.
   2.6.2. When mission requirements prevent written authorization in advance, LGRD verbal
   approval will suffice. However, the AO will provide the written travel order/authorization to
   LGRD/CTO immediately thereafter.
   2.6.3. In addition to official commercial travel reservations and ticketing (air, bus, rail and
   ship) the CTO provides the following services as identified in the base or centralized CTO
   contract:
       2.6.3.1. Routes official travelers in accordance with DoD‘s order of precedence for travel
       (this AFI, Chapter 2, paragraph 2.3) to ensure legal and contractual requirements are met
       and cost to the Government is minimized to the maximum extent. Making arrangements
       through the CTO ensures that the traveler will be fully reimbursed for official
       transportation costs.
       2.6.3.2. Makes official air transportation travel arrangements on Patriot Express missions
       using the Global Air Transportation and Execution System (GATES) when required by
       the CTO contract.
       2.6.3.3. Makes rental cars arrangements when authorized.
       2.6.3.4. Makes commercial lodging reservations associated with official travel.
       2.6.3.5. Collects and reports statistical data to USTRANSCOM for forecasting
       transportation needs Commercial Travel Information Management (CTIM).
       2.6.3.6. Provides suggestions for alternate routing that could benefit DoD, Air Force, and
       the traveler by saving time and money.
       2.6.3.7. CTO Contracts follow the basic guidelines of the Air Force, CTO Official Travel
       Performance Work Statement (PWS) and Guidelines for Proposal Submission and
       Evaluation.
   2.6.4. The CTO complies with the following when making and ticketing official travel
   accommodations.
       2.6.4.1. The CTO marks the traveler's itinerary/or ticket(s) either electronically or
       manually with the method of payment. Tickets purchased using a Centrally Billed
       Account (CBA) will state, "Airline ticket(s) paid by CBA, Non-Reimbursable to
       Traveler." Tickets purchased using an IBA will state, "Airline Ticket(s) paid by IBA,
       Reimbursable to Traveler".
       2.6.4.2. If a portion of the CBA number is needed on the travel itineraries or other
       documents provided to the traveler, the number entered will be limited to no more than
       the last 5 digits of the CBA number.
AFI24-101 19 OCTOBER 2012                                                                    21


     2.6.4.3. The CTO notifies the LGRD of all airline ticket transactions that have potential
     discrepancies in authorization or billing.
     2.6.4.4. The CTO only receives travel authorizations/requests from, and sends email
     ticket confirmations to, ".mil", ".gov" or ―.edu‖ email addresses.
  2.6.5. The CTO complies with the following when making PCT accommodations and
  ticketing PCT:
     2.6.5.1. The Contractor does not issue PCT tickets (First Class or Business Class)
     without the travel order/authorization being documented as directed in the Joint Federal
     Travel Regulations (JFTR U2000-A2) and the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR C2000-A2).
     The travel order/authorization must specifically state that the use of PCT is
     authorized/approved.
     2.6.5.2. Where extenuating circumstances or emergencies situations preclude the traveler
     from obtaining advance PCT authorization/approval (Ref JTR, par. C2000-A2 and JFTR,
     par.U2000-A2a), after-the-fact approval is permitted. In these situations, the CTO only
     issues PCT tickets when the AO places a statement on the travel order/authorization
     stating, "After-the-fact PCT approval is being/will be pursued‖. Issuance of PCT tickets
     is authorized in anticipation of approval. If PCT is not approved after-the-fact by the
     appropriate authorizing/approval authority, the traveler is responsible for the cost
     difference between the premium class transportation used and the transportation class for
     which the traveler was eligible."
     2.6.5.3. If the Contractor issues PCT tickets without the travel order/authorization
     documentation, PCT approval/authorization statement or the after-the-fact statement by
     the travel order/authorization AO, the contractor is liable for reimbursement to the
     Government for the cost difference between the PCT used and the transportation class for
     which the traveler was eligible.
     2.6.5.4. Travelers are authorized to upgrade to premium class services and
     accommodations at personal expense (e.g., cash or using personal frequent traveler
     benefits) without obtaining PCT approval.
  2.6.6. CTO requirements pertaining to fully unused tickets and partially used tickets and
  turn-in for refunds.
     2.6.6.1. The CTO notifies travelers that all unused and partially used tickets are of value
     and must be turned in for the applicable refund.
     2.6.6.2. The CTO maintains a daily log of all identified fully unused and partially used
     tickets.
     2.6.6.3. The CTO provides the LGRD, once a month, a report of unused tickets obtained
     through the contractor‘s Global Distribution System.
     2.6.6.4. The CTO identifies and cancels unused tickets 30 days after the last scheduled
     travel date, and initiates the ticket refund process.
     2.6.6.5. The CTO processes unused ticket refund requests with the airlines.
     2.6.6.6. The CTO provides the LGRD with copies of all requests for refunds.
 22                                                               AFI24-101 19 OCTOBER 2012


       2.6.6.7. The CTO provides the LGRD with the data required to complete the Unused
       Ticket Data and Refund Data report.
   2.6.7. The CTO complies with the CBA Procedures identified in Attachment 5 of this AFI
   and/or as specified in the CTO contract statement of work.
   2.6.8. Unused ticket reports are due to the MAJCOMs the first week of the following month
   after the end of the quarter. MAJCOM consolidated reports are due to AF/A4LE no later
   than the 10th of the following month after the end of each quarter.
2.7. Use of Premium Class Travel (PCT) Accommodations. DoD policy requires the use of
least expensive coach class transportation accommodations for all official travel. Travel
requirements should be determined in sufficient time to reserve coach class accommodations for
members, employees and their dependents. Advance planning to include the use of alternate
travel dates or rest stops is essential to ensure travelers comply with DoD policy. PCT
accommodations may be used only when exceptional circumstances are warranted to meet
mission requirements and must not be common practice. Blanket authorization/approval of PCT
is not permitted. Requests for PCT accommodations will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
PCT accommodations shall not be used for PCS travel nor for CONUS to CONUS flights, except
for those limited conditions outlined in the JFTR or JTR. When PCT is authorized/approved it
applies to the principal traveler only, unless specifically approved for other travelers in the party.
PCT upgrades are permitted without approval when there is no cost to the Government (e.g.,
through the use of cash or frequent traveler benefits). For guidance on using frequent flyer
program benefits for upgrade to premium class travel, see Chapter 3, paragraph 3.30 of this
AFI.
   2.7.1. Premium Class Travel (PCT) Categories. There are two types of PCT
   accommodations: first class and premium class other than first class. Hereafter, premium
   class, other than first class, will be referred to as business class in this AFI. When an airline
   flight has only two classes of service, the higher class of service, regardless of the term used,
   is treated as first class.
       2.7.1.1. PCT accommodations may be authorized/approved on an exception basis only as
       outlined in the JFTR, paragraph U3520, for military personnel and their dependents and
       the JTR, paragraph C3520, for DoD civilian employees, their dependents, and others
       traveling under Invitational Travel Authorizations (ITAs).
       2.7.1.2. First class travel accommodations may be authorized/approved when at least one
       of the criteria identified in the JTR, paragraph C3520-C or the JFTR, paragraph U3520-C
       is met, fully justified and documented.
       2.7.1.3. Business class travel accommodations may be authorized/approved when at least
       one of the criteria identified in the JTR, paragraph C3520-C or the JFTR, paragraph
       U3520-C is met, fully justified and documented.
   2.7.2. Premium Class Travel Authorizing/Reporting Officials.              PCT can only be
   authorized/approved on an exception basis. Authorizing/approving officials must consider
   each request for PCT accommodations individually and carefully balance good stewardship
   of scarce resources with the immediacy of mission requirements. Requests that do not clearly
   substantiate an exceptional mission need justifying the use of PCT should be disapproved. To
   assist the traveler and the PCT authorizing/approving official in the request/approval process,
AFI24-101 19 OCTOBER 2012                                                                    23


  the      Premium    Class     Travel    Reporting   Tool     is     available       at
  https://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/PremiumTravel/. NOTE: Refer to Table 2.1 at the end
  of this section.
        2.7.2.1. Self-approval of PCT for first or business class is prohibited.
     2.7.2.2. Code two and three Presidential appointees and three- and four-star general
     officers must obtain business class travel approval from a person senior to the traveler in
     their chain of command.
     2.7.2.3. The Deployment & Distribution Flight (LGRD)/Commercial Travel Office
     (CTO) will not authorize/approve first or business class travel accommodations when
     regularly scheduled flights between the authorized origin and destination (including
     connection points) provide only first class or business class accommodations. These
     flights must be authorized/approved by the appropriate first or business class travel
     authorizing/approving authority. Each MAJCOM will have a Reporting Office to
     authorize/approve PCT request.
     2.7.2.4. First class travel accommodations. The SECAF has designated SAF/OS and
     SAF/US as the approval authorities for all first class travel accommodation requests,
     except as noted below. First class travel requests for civilian personnel will be submitted
     to SAF/AA for review and routing to SAF/OS or SAF/US as appropriate for
     consideration. First class travel requests for military personnel will be routed to
     AF/A4LE for review and forwarding to AF/CV. The AF/CV will review and determine
     whether or not military requests should be forwarded to SAF/AA for approval

     2.7.2.8. The AF/CV or AF/CVA in the absence of the CV, is the authorization/approval

     AF/CV for consideration.
     2.7.2.9. In accordance with the JTR, paragraphs C3520 (First Class) and (Business
     Class) and JFTR, paragraphs U3520 (First Class) and U3520-C (Business Class) the
     category "When required by mission" can only be applied in connection with Federal
     advisory committees, special high-level invited guests, and U.S. defense attachés
     accompanying ministers of foreign governments traveling to the U.S. to consult with
     members of the Federal government (approval level is Director, Administration and
     Management, Office of the SECDEF, or as delegated by the Director) and for the Armed
     Forces Entertainment (AFE) Program, (approval level is the Executive Agent for the AFE
     program, currently the Department of the Air Force).
  2.7.3. Premium Class Travel (PCT) Approval Process. Every effort should be made to obtain
  authorization prior to traveling. However, in cases where extenuating or emergency
  circumstances make advanced authorization impossible, the traveler must still obtain "after-
  the-fact" written approval at the earliest possible time. In the event an after-the-fact request is
  disapproved, the traveler is liable for the difference in cost between the premium class and
  coach class air accommodations. (Note: JFTR/JTR, U3505.B, Business/First Class Airfare
  Costs Less than Least Expensive Unrestricted Economy-/Coach-class Airfare. When a
  business-/first-class airfare costs less than the least expensive unrestricted economy/coach
  class airfare, no authorization/approval is required. Comparison of the business/first class
  airfare to an economy/coach class airfare more expensive than the least expensive
  unrestricted economy/coach class airfare is not authorized).
     2.7.3.1. The designated authorizing/approval officials may authorize/approve first class
     accommodations when at least one of the conditions in the JFTR, paragraph U3520-C or
     the JTR, paragraph C3520-C is met, and may approve business class accommodations
     provided at least one of the conditions in the JFTR, paragraph U3520-C or JTR,
     paragraph C3520-C is met.
     2.7.3.2. To assist the authorization/approval official in determining whether the PCT
     request meets the JTR/JFTR criteria, please refer to JFTR/JTR Appendix H.
     2.7.3.3. The traveler submits the PCT request through the traveler‘s authorizing/order-
     issuing official (AO) to the appropriate PCT authorization/approval authority designated
     above. Requests for PCT accommodation that must be approved at the AF/CV, SAF/AA,
     SAF/US or SAF/OS levels should be submitted as soon as the requirement is anticipated,
     but not less than 15 duty days prior to the desired travel date. Note: MAJCOMs, DRUs,
     and FOAs may want to establish PCT internal routing procedures for their organizations.
     2.7.3.4. The designated PCT authorization/approval authority reviews the request to
     ensure sufficient justification is provided to show mission necessity and justify the
     expenditure of additional Government funds. After the decision is made to approve or
     disapprove the PCT request, the PCT authorization/approval authority forwards the
     decision to the travel authorizing/approving official (AO). If the PCT request is approved,
AFI24-101 19 OCTOBER 2012                                                                       25


       the PCT approval authority must retain a file copy of the approved package for a period
       of 6 years and 3 months for audit purposes.
       2.7.3.5. When the travel AO receives the PCT authorization/approval authority‘s
       decision, the AO notifies the traveler of the decision. If approved, the AO ensures that the
       appropriate documentation (see below for appropriate words) is entered on the travel
       order/authorization so the CTO can issue PCT tickets.
   2.7.4. PCT Documentation Requirements.
       2.7.4.1. Before the CTO can issue PCT tickets, a statement must be entered in the
       remarks section of the travel order/authorization indicating that PCT has been approved.
       The minimum information that must be entered on the travel order/authorization is:
           2.7.4.1.1. The type of PCT accommodations approved. (First Class or Business
           Class)
           2.7.4.1.2. The regulatory reference in the JTR/JFTR that was used to justify the PCT.
           2.7.4.1.3. The cost difference between the premium class and coach class fares
           (normal Government routing, YCA and other Government contract fares, etc.,
           available).
           2.7.4.1.4. The premium class approving authority, Name, Rank, and Office Symbol.
           An example of the required statement:
Example: Business class travel has been justified and approved based on JFTR, U3520; space is
not available in coach class. The cost difference between the Business class fare and the coach
class fare is $765.00. This PCT was approved by General, David Smith, HQ USAF/XXXX. Full
documentation of the PCT approval is on file in the office of the PCT approving official.
       2.7.4.2. For those situations, as identified in the JFTR, paragraph U2000, where
       "extenuating     circumstances    or     emergency     situations"    prevent    advance
       authorization/approval of premium class travel, a statement will be placed on that travel
       order/authorization to permit CTO ticketing. The statement must indicate the extenuating
       circumstance or emergency precluding PCT authorization/approval prior to the start of
       travel and that approval is being or will be pursued after-the-fact. Issuance of PCT
       tickets by the CTO is permitted in anticipation of approval. If the authorizing/approval
       authority does not approve the after-the-fact PCT request, the traveler is responsible for
       the cost difference between the PCT transportation used and the transportation class for
       which the traveler was eligible. The statement must include the cost difference between
       the coach class and the premium class being requested and the name, rank and office
       symbol of the AO. The JFTR/JTR requires that after-the-fact PCT approval be completed
       within seven days of travel completion. It will be the responsibility of the traveler and
       AO to ensure that the PCT approval is obtained or that the traveler pays the difference
       between the travel class authorized and the travel class used. An example of required
       statement:
Example: After-the fact approval for business class travel is being pursued. This is a short notice
travel requirement and sufficient time is not available to obtain authorization/approval prior to
travel commencement. Business class travel is being justified in accordance with JFTR,
paragraph U3520; space is not available in coach class. The cost difference between the business
 26                                                              AFI24-101 19 OCTOBER 2012


class fare and the coach class fare is $765.00. If the request for business class travel is not
approved, the traveler is responsible for the cost difference between the business class fare and
the coach class fare. The travel order/authorization, authorizing official is Lt Col, Robert Jones,
355th XXX. The CTO is authorized to provide business class tickets for this travel.
   2.7.5. Premium Class Travel Reporting Requirement. All approved PCT must be entered
   into        the        Premium         Class        Reporting       Tool          at
   https://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/PremiumTravel/index.cfm within 5 business days of
   approval.
        2.7.5.1. ‗Exceptional circumstances‘ may be - travel on an extremely demanding
        schedule, the requirement to work enroute to the TDY location, and the need to be
        prepared to perform official duties and properly represent the Air Force or U.S.
        Government immediately upon arrival.
        2.7.5.2. Per the JFTR/JTR, the length of the flight(s) alone is not itself sufficient basis
        for approval of PCT. Use of the '14-hour rule', as it relates to rest stops, requires that
        scheduled flight time (including stopovers) is in excess of 14 hours, and that the traveler
        be required to perform a full day (8 hours) of work immediately upon arrival at the TDY
        location. Business class travel cannot be approved under this rule when rest stops are
        approved.

NOTES:
1. Premium class travel authorizing/approving officials may not approve their own premium
class travel accommodations. Authorization/approval must be obtained from a senior flag officer
or civilian equivalent. Example: A four-star MAJCOM commander has business class approval
authority for those within the MAJCOM on an exception basis and when the travel first
class/business class request meets the established criteria in the JFTR/JTR. However,
MAJCOM commanders must submit their own business class travel requests to CSAF or
AF/CV, as appropriate.
2. Civilian requests for first class travel will be submitted to SAF/AA. SAF/AA will review
requests prior to forwarding to SAF/US or SAF/OS as appropriate. Military member requests for
first class travel will be submitted to AF/A4LE. AF/A4LE will review requests and forward to
AF/CV for review and forward to SAF/AA who will review and forward to SAF/US or SAF/OS
for approval consideration.
3. The authorization/approval authority for business class travel may be delegated no lower than
to a three-star general officer or civilian equivalent level, and the approving official must be
senior in the reporting chain to the requester. Therefore, if the indicated approval authority is not
a three-star general officer or civilian equivalent or higher and senior in the chain of command,
the request must be forwarded up the chain of command for appropriate approval.
4. Civilians assigned to the Air Staff and Secretariat will submit business class requests to
SAF/AA. Military member requests for business class travel will be submitted to AF/A4LE.
AF/A4LE will review requests and forward to AF/CV for review and forwarding to SAF/AA
who will in turn review and as appropriate forward to SAF/US or SAF/OS for approval
consideration. SAF/AA is the business class approval authority for three-star generals and
below, and civilian equivalents assigned to the Air Staff and Secretariat. SAF/OS and SAF/US
are the business class approval authorities for four-star generals and civilian equivalents assigned
to the Air Staff and Secretariat.
5. For personnel traveling on Air Force business, MAJCOM/CCs, and MAJCOM/CVs in the
absence of the MAJCOM/CC, have business class approval authority for personnel under their
command, including personnel assigned to numbered air forces. When personnel travel on Joint
business, requests for business class travel approval are submitted in accordance with Joint staff
or command approval procedures.

2.8. Official Family Member/Spouse Travel. As a general rule, a family member may not
travel at government expense with a sponsor who is traveling on official business (TDY).
However, travel is permitted under certain circumstances. Typically, family member travel
involves spouses. Because spouse travel is a highly visible and sensitive area, it requires
judicious application with a thorough review at each level of command. Precedent setting
requests require a high level of scrutiny and legal office coordination is mandatory. Requests for
spouse travel at Government expense must show there is an unquestionably official function in
which the spouse/family member is actually to participate in an official capacity or it must be
deemed in the national interest because of diplomatic or public relations benefit to the country
(See DoDD 4500.56, enclosure 3, paragraph 5, April 14, 2009). Both commercial and MILAIR
authorization/approval must be supported with ITAs, ordinarily authorizing reimbursement of
AFI24-101 19 OCTOBER 2012                                                                      31


transportation costs only. Travel by MILAIR is allowed on a mission non-interference basis. The
following are Family Member/Spouse Travel approving authorities when the travel meets
established criteria in this AFI and JFTR/JTR:
   2.8.1.1. SECAF and CSAF for their own family member/spouse travel;
       2.8.1.2. SECAF for family member/spouse travel of members of the Secretariat;
       2.8.1.3. AF/CV for family member/spouse travel of personnel assigned to the HAF;
       2.8.1.4. AF/CV and four star MAJCOM/CC‘s for their own family member/spouse
       travel;
       2.8.1.5. AF/CV for three star or lower MAJCOM/CC‘s family member/spouse travel;
       2.8.1.6. Selected three-star general officers, when serving as combined commanders (i.e.,
       5 AF/CC, 7 AF/CC, 11 AF/CC), for their own family member/spouse‘s travel.
       2.8.1.7. MAJCOM/CC‘s and CV‘s for all family member/spouse travel of personnel
       assigned to their command; and,
       2.8.1.8. AF/CV for family member/spouse travel of personnel assigned to DRU (i.e, AF
       Academy) / FOA, and for all other Air Force personnel not covered by an approval
       authority identified above.
   2.8.2. Guidelines for approving spouse travel at Government expense based on actual
   participation in an official event. In the limited instances per diem or other actual expenses
   are to be paid, the CSAF must grant prior approval. Per diem and other expense allowances
   may be authorized by CSAF if the individual's travel is mission essential and there is a
   benefit for DoD beyond fulfilling a representational role (See JTR/JFTR, Appendix E,
   paragraph 13.c). No travel arrangements may be made for spouse travel until approved by the
   proper authority.
       2.8.2.1. A request for a spouse‘s attendance at conferences, events, visits or tours is not
       on its own merit sufficient justification for spouse travel at Government expense. To meet
       the criteria for ―actual participation‖ the spouse must actually confer with DoD officials
       on official DoD matters in a manner directly benefiting the Air Force through an
       exchange of substantive information, advice and/or guidance.
   2.8.3. Guidelines for approving spouse travel based on a diplomatic or public relations
   benefit to the nation. There may be functions when it is in the best interest of the nation to
   have a spouse participate. However, the issues or audiences must transcend Air Force only
   interests. The term ―national interest‖ infers some broader interest than that of the military
   departments or the DoD.
       2.8.3.1. Examples of events having a diplomatic or public relations benefit to the nation.
          2.8.3.1.1. Travel requests may include trips to functions with government officials of
          foreign countries, including travel of spouses to act as escorts for spouses during
          CSAF counterpart visits or attaché visits, and meeting with officials of the foreign
          ministry, defense ministry and foreign air force. Public relations events may
          (depending on the facts) include visiting with local officials where Air Force
          personnel are stationed. It may include travel within the U.S. when the spouse
32                                                             AFI24-101 19 OCTOBER 2012


         accompanies the Air Force official to public relations functions, which include
         spouses of local officials and/or civic leaders.
         2.8.3.1.2. A spouse‘s participation in a social event attended only by DoD or Air
         Force officials is not sufficient justification for travel at government expense.
         2.8.3.1.3. When officials outside of US military departments will be present,
         including local officials or civic leaders, visits to DoD schools, hospitals, day-care
         facilities, family service centers, family housing areas, housing management offices,
         commissary or exchange facilities.
         2.8.3.1.4. Representing the military family at key civic events that are attended by
         officials outside the US military departments and DoD.
  2.8.4. Unofficial Family Member/Spouse Travel. Family members traveling at personal
  expense, to accompany senior DoD personnel on official business. Such unofficial travel is
  authorized on military aircraft only on a noninterference basis: the aircraft is already
  scheduled for an official purpose; official travelers are not displaced; it results in negligible
  additional cost to the Government; the Government is reimbursed at the full commercial
  coach class fare rate (IAW Office of Management and Budget, Circular No. A-126, Full
  coach fare is defined as a coach fare available to the general public between the day that the
  travel was planned and the day the travel occurred.) Advantage can be taken of early
  purchase discounts and internet purchasing alternatives as long as the fare matches the times
  and dates of actual travel and is available to the general public. The senior DoD official will
  attach to his or her travel voucher a personal check made payable to the Treasurer of the
  United States and include a travel office printout that reflects the full coach class fare. See
  DoD 4515.13R C10.12.
  2.8.5. Invitational Travel Authorization (ITA). In all instances of spouse travel, after the
  authorizing authority approves spouse travel, the requesting organization will issue an ITA in
  accordance with AFI 65-103 Temporary Duty Orders, the JFTR/ JTR, Appendix E, funding
  transportation only. A specific approval request must be generated for each instance of
  spouse travel. The ITA will be personally signed by the sponsor. ―Blanket‖ ITAs may not be
  issued. Documentation to include a separate itinerary agenda is mandatory and will be
  retained for two years. An invitation and agenda/itinerary is required as supporting
  documentation. When the family member/spouse is an Air Force uniformed service member
  or Air Force Civil Service employee and family member/spouse travel is approved, a TDY
  order will be issued rather than an ITA.
     2.8.5.1. Include the following statement in the ITA as specified in JFTR/JTR, Part
     1,Appendix E., ―This order authorizes the dependent to accompany the sponsor to attend
     an official function. It does not entitle the dependent to per diem or other expense
     allowances. If the dependent does not desire to bear the expenses, this order is canceled.‖
  2.8.6. Four-star generals officers are authorized to approve their own spouse‘s travel when
  the travel meets the criteria of this AFI.
  2.8.7. MAJCOM Commanders/Vice Commanders may approve spouse travel for personnel
  assigned to their command when the travel meets the criteria of this AFI. 2.8.7.1 through
  2.8.7.5 are examples of spouse travel deemed to meet the criteria for unquestionably official
  travel. Note: A Vice Commander cannot approve a spouse travel request for his or her own
AFI24-101 19 OCTOBER 2012                                                                        33


   spouse in the absence of the MAJCOM/CC. (Only four-star general officers may self-
   approve as outlined in DoDD 4500.56, DoDPolicy on the Use of Government Aircraft and
   Air Travel. MAJCOM three-star commanders (i.e. AFSOC, AFGSC, and AFRC) require
   AF/CV approval for travel of their spouse.
      2.8.7.1. Spouse travel for Numbered Air Force (NAF) Commander‘s spouse may be
      approved for visits to NAF bases. Spouse travel visits should be limited to host
      wing/bases subordinate to the NAF, and planners and travelers are to involve more than
      one base per trip.
      2.8.7.2. Spouse travel may be approved for MAJCOM Commander/Command Chief
      Master Sergeant Annual Conferences. Spouse travel for this event should be limited to
      one trip per fiscal year.
      2.8.7.3. Spouse travel may be authorized for MAJCOM sponsored Squadron
      Commander Orientation Conferences when the sponsor attending is a current commander
      (with at least 12 months tenure remaining), commander civilian equivalent, or a
      commander designee selected through quota control procedures without regard to current
      command assignment. Only one trip to the commander orientation conference should be
      authorized during the sponsor‘s tenure as a squadron commander.
      2.8.7.4. Spouse travel may be approved for Professional Development Programs and
      should be limited to no more than two events per year each for the officer and enlisted
      professional development program.
      2.8.7.5. Participating in DoD or service component training courses, conferences, or
      seminars supporting family readiness as a ―subject-matter expert‖ (e.g., the spouse is
      qualified to speak/train by virtue of his/her education in a particular subject.)
      2.8.7.6. At the discretion of the MAJCOM/CC/CV, other similar spouse travel events
      may be approved when the travel meets the criteria of this AFI. Note: Spouse travel is
      not automatically authorized for Wing Commander/Command Chief visits to units
      subordinate to a wing.
   2.8.8. Selected three-star generals officers (5AF/CC, 7AF/CC, 11AF/CC) serving as
   combined commanders are authorized to approve their own spouse travel when acting in the
   role of the combined commander when the travel meets the criteria of this AFI. When acting
   in their Air Force role, these commanders must submit their spouse travel requests IAW
   paragraph 2.8.6 (also see DoD 4515.13-R Enclosure 2).
   2.8.9. Spouse travel requests not under the cognizant authority of a commander specified
   above must be forwarded through command/air staff channels to AF/CV (provide
   information copy to AF/A4L for staffing) for authorization/approval. Requests should be
   submitted as soon as the requirement is anticipated, but not less than 20 duty days prior to the
   desired travel date. When submitting requests to the AF/CV, the MAJCOM commander (CV
   in CC‘s absence) must sign all requests. Full justification is required for all requests and must
   meet the criteria of this AFI.
2.9. Family Member/Spouse Travel to Award Ceremonies.
   2.9.1. This family member/spouse travel to award ceremonies is not the same as the spouse
   travel outlined in paragraph 2.8, requiring official participation. MAJCOM commanders and
 34                                                            AFI24-101 19 OCTOBER 2012


   vice commanders may approve spouse travel for spouses of Air Force or higher level award
   recipients assigned to their command. Several examples of applicable major awards that fit
   this spouse approval criteria include:        Presidential awards, annual agency/ major
   organizational component ceremonies (does not include MAJCOM level awards), prestigious
   honorary award Ceremony sponsored by a non-Federal organization and those listed in AFI
   36-2805, Special Trophies and Awards . When family member/spouse travel to attend an
   award ceremony is approved, an Invitational Travel Authorization (ITA) will be issued. Only
   transportation costs will be funded; per diem will not be paid.
      2.9.1.1. If there is no spouse or the spouse is unable to attend, the recipient may elect to
      invite one family member to attend the ceremony. When family member travel to attend
      an award ceremony is approved, an ITA will be issued. Only transportation costs will be
      funded; per diem will not be paid. See JTR, Appendix E, Part I for further guidance.
      2.9.1.2. When the family member/spouse is an Air Force uniformed service member or
      Air Force Civil Service employee and family member/spouse travel is approved; a TDY
      order will be issued rather than an ITA.
      2.9.1.3. When an individual who is neither an Air Force member nor an Air Force Civil
      Service employee is selected as an award recipient, the recipient and family
      member/spouse may travel on an ITA to attend the presentation ceremony. See
      JFTR/JTR, Appendix E, for guidance and limitations on travel reimbursements. NOTE:
      Refer to the JTR/JFTR, Appendix E for instructions and limitations on travel
      reimbursements for members and employees and ITA for family members and non-
      Department of the Air Force civilians.
NOTE: Family members and spouses traveling to an award ceremony are not required to meet
the participation requirements stipulated in this AFI, Paragraph 2.8.
AFI24-101 19 OCTOBER 2012                                                                     35



                                           Chapter 3

                                  TRAVEL PROCEDURES

3.1. Dual Commitment Transportation. Dual commitment transportation refers to two or
more travelers or government entities that make duplicate bookings on any mode of
transportation, or are working to have two types of air transportation (military and commercial).
Commercial air transportation will not be requested or scheduled for DOD group travel (10 or
more seats) unless all actions to obtain military air transportation have been terminated. DOD
travelers and government entities will practice prudent use of all modes of commercial
transportation to enable the DOD to continue to access low cost commercial travel (DTR 4500.9-
R, Ch 102, para B).
3.2. Group movements. Once the provisions of para 2.3 are met (Order of Precedence) the
following applies:
   3.2.1. A movement of less than 10 members traveling as a group, falls under the GSA
   Airline City Pair Program contract and is a mandatory user of the GSA Airline City Pair
   Program (DTR).
   3.2.2. Group movement of 10 or more members falls under the Military Air Transportation
   Agreement (MATA) and is a non-mandatory user of the GSA Airline City Pair Program.
   Booking individual reservations in order to by-pass group booking procedures is in violation
   of airline tariffs and is not acceptable under any circumstances. LGRD has the authority to
   route any size group except those requiring the purchase of a full planeload charter.
   3.2.3. Under the GSA Airline City Pair Program agreement and the (MATA, airlines may
   impose group travel cancellation penalties for late passenger cancellations and no-shows.
   Reference the GSA Airfares City Pair contract (Para. B.2) and/or the MATA (Para. E.1) for
   cancellation fee information on groups (DTR 4500.9- R).
   3.2.4. The DTR, Part 1, Ch. 102, Paragraph F, provides procedures on how to request group
   movements.
3.3. Leave-In-Conjunction with Official (LICWO) Travel. The official travel orders
establish the official travel points. For Official travel CTO use is mandatory. Travelers
desiring to self procure their travel must ensure the provision is included in the Orders.
When a traveler is taking leave-in-conjunction with official PCS/TDY travel, the use of
government contract airfares (e.g., YCA, _CA) and other government fares (e.g., YMZ, MMZ,
MDG, LDG, etc.) are strictly prohibited to and from leave points. These fares are offered by the
airline industry for official travel purposes only, not for unfunded leave travel. Most airlines
offer military members special or discount leave fares. The traveler must schedule all official
travel through the LGRD/CTO to ensure appropriate routing and reimbursement. The LGRD
must establish and publish local procedures for obtaining LICWO travel services based on their
CTO contract and the method used for travel arrangements and ticketing.
   3.3.1. Leisure travel services may be provided by the Leisure Travel CTO on base. In this
   situation the Leisure Travel CTO has exclusive rights to provide strictly leisure travel
   services on the base. In the Air Force, this method is being phased out, eliminating the on
 36                                                              AFI24-101 19 OCTOBER 2012


   base leisure travel CTO. The leisure travel CTO is being replaced by the Services‘
   Information, Tickets and Travel (ITT) office.
       3.3.1.1. Some bases have ITT office operating on base. Unless prohibited in the DTMO
       Contract language, the Official Travel CTO can provide arrangements and ticketing for
       both the leisure and official travel for both the traveler and family members traveling on
       same day/days as official travel, when requested by the official traveler. However, even
       though travelers are required use the Official CTO for all Official travel, it is strictly the
       individual‘s choice to arrange LICWO with the official CTO. The traveler may also elect
       to make leisure travel arrangements through the ITT office. Members are responsible for
       paying all additional fees above the official government cost.
   3.3.2. When the desired LICWO travel involves deviating from normal routing for the
   official travel, and unusual or emergency conditions exist, making use of the CTO
   impractical, or the CTO is unavailable/unable to provide the requested service, the
   LGRD/CTO and FM must issue a LICWO travel memo (Attachment 4) to the traveler
   allowing them to self-procure one-way or roundtrip tickets, whichever benefits the member,
   when approved in advance. The memo must identify Government costs limits for the official
   portion of the trip, and precludes problems with the traveler obtaining proper reimbursement.
   3.3.3. A member on leave and ordered to return to a duty station (permanent or TDY) for
   duty generally must bear the cost of returning unless recalled for operational reasons as stated
   in the JFTR, U7220 or JTR C4564.
3.4. Government Travel Card (GTC). Air Force members and employees must use their IBA
when it has been issued to procure official travel services through the CTO. MAJCOMs, may
direct the method of payment for their respective bases, but should only use CBA when the
mission dictates. LGRD must provide written notification to the traveler or the finance services
office (FSO) when directing procurement of airline tickets from a source other than the CTO.
LGRD, in conjunction with the CTO and FSO, must establish local procedures for the use of an
IBA and CBA. According to SAF/FMP, the GTC Program Manager, travelers are prohibited
from using their GTC to pay for excess travel cost charged to them and not the government.
3.5. International Travel. The official travel orders establish the official travel points. To
arrange routes and reservations, the LGRD/CTO routes the traveler IAW DTR 4500.9R, Part I,
Appendix O, GSA Airline City Pair Program, DoD 4500.54-G (https://www.fcg.pentagon.mil)
and other appropriate industry publications and service directives.
   3.5.1. The LGRD/CTO must obtain reservations from the AMC Passenger Operations
   Center by telephone or via GATES for international travel when available. If military or
   AMC contracted air transportation is not available, the LGRD/CTO must route travelers
   using the GSA Airline City Pair Program fares (when available) over the normally traveled
   route between the closest international airport serving the old or new PDS, the official TDY
   location, or the designated privately owned vehicle (POV) port or vehicle processing center
   (VPC). Members desiring to select an alternate international airport between the losing and
   gaining duty stations; must be informed that this constitutes circuitous travel (PCS only), and
   must be processed IAW paragraph 3.10. All unapproved deviations/circuitous travel (e.g.
   personal travel detours from the usual traveled route) is the traveler‘s financial responsibility.
   Travel reimbursement must not exceed the government constructive costs between the old
   and the new duty stations.
AFI24-101 19 OCTOBER 2012                                                                        37


   3.5.2. A 10-day travel window is required for all PCS travelers; however, a 14-day window
   is recommended for members traveling with pets. For all other types of official travel (except
   emergency leave, short-notice, humanitarian travelers, retirements, etc.), it is highly
   recommended that each MAJCOM/LGRD establishes a travel window to ensure maximum
   utilization of available resources such as Patriot Express missions without mission
   degradation.
   3.5.3. To establish a uniform entitlement for official travel cost comparisons, use the priority
   order of precedence for passenger airlift provided in paragraph 2.3 Guidelines in the
   following paragraphs establish the recommended primary ports for PCS, TDY and other
   transoceanic travel such as: circuitous travel, early return of dependents, student travel, etc.
   These guidelines do not apply to emergency leave.
       3.5.3.1. For travel to and from Pacific Air Force‘s (PACAF) installations, use Seattle
       International Airport, or any available suitable AMC channel if available and if it meets
       mission requirements. If AMC is not available, use GSA City Pairs. If City Pair fares are
       not available use the best value commercial airfare that meets mission requirements.
       Example: PCS travel may originate/terminate at either the closest airport to the PDS or
       the VPC when a POV is actually shipped.
       3.5.3.2. For travel to and from United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) and United
       States Central Command (USCENTCOM) installations, use Baltimore-Washington
       International Airport, or any available suitable AMC channel if available, and if it meets
       mission requirements. If AMC is not available, use GSA City Pairs. If City Pair fares
       are not available use the best value commercial airfare that meets mission requirements.
       Example: PCS travel may originate/terminate at either the closest airport to the PDS,
       VPC when a POV is actually shipped.
   3.5.4. Travelers may request a rest stop on international flights at the CONUS/OCONUS
   port of entry in connection with official travel. Rest stops may be requested for international
   travel when offered by the airline carrier and it is at no additional cost to the government, and
   travel is conducted over the normally traveled route. A rest stop must not exceed 24 hours.
   Travelers must not be routed circuitously to take advantage of a rest stop. See JFTR,
   par.U4326 and JTR, par. C1709.
3.6. Excess Cost Collection for Official Travel. AMC fares, GSA Airline City Pair program
fares or other government fares when available, are the primary method for determining official
travel cost. Fares must be based on the air service available at the time of request (e.g., how
much the travel cost would have been if LGRD/CTO had booked the travel). When the IBA is
used, the traveler submits a voucher for reimbursement of authorized government travel costs
only. When a CBA or GTR (SF 1169) is used and a member‘s travel request exceeds the
authorized government cost, LGRD/CTO must initiate a DD Form 1131, Cash Collection
Voucher or DD Form 139, Pay Adjustment Authorization. These forms may be viewed at
http://web1/whs.osd.mil/. Government constructive costs should be on the Passenger Name
Record (PNR) and filed with travel voucher as appropriate for the following:
   3.6.1. Circuitous travel.
   3.6.2. DoD civilians space-required emergency leave (cash reimbursement basis).
   3.6.3. Noncommand sponsored dependents, (AMC airlift or travel only).
 38                                                            AFI24-101 19 OCTOBER 2012


   3.6.4. Consecutive overseas tours (COT)/In-place (IPCOT).
   3.6.5. Renewal agreement travel (RAT).
3.7. Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Travel. The local Military Personnel Section
(MPS), Civilian Personnel Office (CPO) and the Deployment & Distribution Flight (LGRD)
should jointly develop a local procedure for obtaining port calls. This request should be
submitted NLT 90 days prior to the member‘s projected departure date. The LGRD/CTO secures
travel reservations and provides confirmed flight or ship information back to the servicing MPF
or CPO.
   3.7.1. It is Air Force policy to offer PCS travelers confirmed port call reservations optimally
   60 days and minimally 45 days prior to departure from the old PDS. Delays may impose
   personal hardships for service members or civilian employees and their family members.
   When the AMC Passenger Operations Center is unable to confirm a reservation within a
   reasonable period of time or the member begins to experience hardships associated with not
   having a confirmed port call, the LGRD should obtain commercial airline reservations to
   meet mission requirements. However, the LGRD must ensure that DoD 4500.54-G or other
   directives do not otherwise restrict such travel. The guidelines for order of precedence must
   be followed.
   3.7.2. The gaining and losing commanders are responsible for de-conflicting reporting dates
   for members to maximize use of Patriot Express missions. The MPS provides PCS data
   sheets to both commanders and if signed by the losing commander, the port call may be
   changed and processed. The MPS or CPF initiates changes or cancellations for all port calls.
   3.7.3. When concurrent travel is authorized, it must be included in the member‘s PCS order.
   Family members with concurrent travel approval in their sponsor‘s PCS orders, but electing
   to delay their travel over 120 days after the member departs, lose their concurrent travel
   status and non-concurrent dependent travel orders must be published by the servicing MPS.
   3.7.4. All Air Force members, Air Force civilians, and family members are required to
   obtain government-procured transoceanic travel through the LGRD/CTO. LGRD/CTO must
   use DoD owned, -controlled or -contracted aircraft to move travelers to, from and within
   overseas areas, when available. Self-procurement of transoceanic official travel is not
   authorized unless specifically approved prior to travel.
   3.7.5. During PCS travel delivery or pick up of a POV concurrent with PCS is defined as
   any vehicle transportation action performed entirely within a separate leg of PCS travel. All
   other PCS travel related to vehicle transportation actions are considered non-concurrent. For
   concurrent entitlements JFTR paragraphs U5431 C, D, and E apply. Non-concurrent
   members are authorized transportation allowances IAW JFTR paragraph U5413 B for
   transportation of a vehicle to/from a VPC/port by any means (commercial or personally
   procured). If the vehicle is shipped non-concurrently with the PCS and members are in
   possession of orders, they are reimbursed round trip mileage from the old permanent duty
   station to the VPC/port at the current TDY mileage rate. For the purpose of receiving
   transportation allowances, there are no restrictions as to who may deliver or pick up the
   vehicle.
Note: Members are not authorized government procured transportation for this travel.
AFI24-101 19 OCTOBER 2012                                                                     39


3.8. Early Return of Dependents (ERD) Travel (JFTR, par. U5900 and JTR par. C5450).
The installation commander may authorize return of OCONUS command-sponsored dependents
or the commanding officer designated by the Service Secretary concerned. Normally, requests
are initiated by the sponsor and subject to approval on a case-by-case basis. The travel
entitlement is from OCONUS to the place specified in the travel order.
3.9. Noncommand Sponsored Dependents. Reference DoD 4515.13-R, Chapter 2, paragraph
C2.2.3.2.
3.10. Circuitous Travel. The Air Force defines circuitous travel as any route other than the one
normally prescribed by the LGRD/CTO between the official places listed in members travel
orders (JFTR and JTR). Members and their accompanying dependents that are command
sponsored may be authorized circuitous travel in connection with PCS travel to, from, and
between overseas areas. Members requesting circuitous travel are required to pay excess costs
(if any) compared to the cost the government would have paid over the LGRD/CTO prescribed
travel route. Use Attachment 3 to make your request. The following are guidelines and
examples for approval of circuitous routing:
   3.10.1. Military members and their command-sponsored dependents may obtain approval for
   circuitous travel in connection with PCS travel (including separations and retirements). The
   circuitous routing authorization does not extend to other types of official travel (e.g., TDY,
   student travel, renewal agreement travel, emergency leave, etc.).
   3.10.2. Command-sponsored dependents may accompany the member on the approved
   circuitous route or travel independently.
   3.10.3. The authorizing official may approve circuitous travel for any travel performed on
   ERD, IPCOT, and deferred COT travel orders. If orders are generated through MPS,
   members must formally apply for circuitous travel. If generated at the unit level, member
   must obtain unit commander‘s approval prior to requesting travel. The LGRD/CTO must
   ensure circuitous travel routing is authorized in orders before issuing travel documents.
   3.10.4. Circuitous routing must not be used to relocate dependents overseas when the
   sponsor is assigned to a restricted, remote or isolated area. NOTE: This does not apply to
   designated-location moves.
   3.10.5. Space-available travel may be used in conjunction with space-required travel as long
   as space-available travel does not substitute for any single leg for which the traveler has a
   space-required entitlement. Reference DoD 4515.13-R, Chapter 6.
   3.10.6. Travelers assume responsibility for all costs exceeding the normally prescribed route
   determined by the local LGRD/CTO.
   3.10.7. Authorized travelers may self-procure through the CTO all commercial tickets,
   including the transoceanic portion in accordance with the approved (indicated in orders)
   circuitous routing. Reimbursement must be limited to the cost of normal direct point-to-point
   routing for official travel. Reference paragraph 2.4 for foreign-flag carrier rules.
   3.10.8. Requesting and processing circuitous travel. To apply for circuitous travel, the
   member must formally submit a request for application through the MPS to the LGRD/CTO.
       3.10.8.1. Members stationed overseas must submit circuitous travel request at least 120
       days before their Date of Eligibility for Return from Overseas (DEROS).

       3.10.8.2. Members departing CONUS for overseas assignment should submit circuitous
       travel request, at a minimum, 90 days before departure and prior to issuance of orders.
       3.10.8.3. Circuitous travel may be approved when it is in the best interest of the
       member‘s morale and welfare, and the applicant indicates that he/she has sufficient funds
       to defray the costs of that part of the travel, which the government does not pay.
   3.10.9. Approval authority for circuitous travel resides with the servicing MPS with
   assistance being provided from LGRD/CTO. The LGRD/CTO must calculate the cost
   comparison and provide it to the MPS. The servicing MPS places the approved authority for
   circuitous travel in the member‘s PCS travel order. See Attachment 3.
   3.10.10. The member is responsible for the following:
       3.10.10.1. When circuitous travel is desired, ensure approval is annotated in PCS orders
       (including ERD, IPCOT and deferred COT) prior to traveling.
       3.10.10.2. Travelers may procure circuitous travel from the CTO, or directly procure
       airline tickets from other sources when approved by the AO. The MPS must place a
       statement in the orders authorizing self-procurement.
       3.10.10.3. If the member is authorized circuitous travel and chooses to travel by other
       modes (e.g., ship, rail, etc.), the member will receive reimbursement up to the authorized
       cost of the normal route as stated in the PCS travel order (including ERD, COT, and
       deferred COT).
       3.10.10.4. Travel time in excess of normal routing is chargeable as leave.
       3.10.10.5. The member and/or their dependents are responsible for complying with all
       border clearance requirements outlined in the DoD 4500.54-G for countries visited.
       3.10.10.6. The member and/or their dependents must maintain copies of all travel
       documents to support voucher requests for reimbursement up to the government cost.
       3.10.10.7. Transoceanic travel must be by U.S. flag carrier or by foreign flag carrier
       under a US code-share agreement. For more information on foreign-flag carriers see
       paragraph 2.4
       3.10.10.8. Reimbursement for travel on a foreign flag carrier is authorized if U.S. flag
       carriers are not available on the direct/normal route and not available on the circuitous
       route between the old and new permanent duty stations. (See JFTR, par. U3525-H and
       JTR, para. C3525-H)
NOTE: The LGRD/CTO must provide non-U.S. flag carrier availability statement prior to dates
of travel.
3.11. Consecutive Overseas Tour (COT) and In-Place COT Travel (JFTR, par. U7200).
Eligible members and their dependents are authorized travel and transportation for leave, at
government expense, between COT or IPCOT. Air Force members and family members may
travel to their home of record (HOR) or to any other points not to exceed the cost of travel to the
HOR. Because this is Government funded travel, use of GSA Airline City Pairs Program is
authorized. The use of tour packages is prohibited. Tour packages are expressly for leave travel
and are not to be procured with appropriated funds. Members should visit their local MPS to
determine COT entitlements and eligibility.
AFI24-101 19 OCTOBER 2012                                                                        41


3.12. Transoceanic Travel by Ship (DTR 4500. 9-R; JFTR, par. U3655; and JTR, par.
C3655). LGRD must book travel on Military Sealift Command (MSC) controlled ocean-going
ships through SDDC/MTOPT-CP when they are authorized and available. On ships with two or
more accommodation classes, use the lowest class accommodations available.
   3.12.1. Military dependents may use ship transportation at government expense for PCS
   travel when they have verification of a medical condition precluding travel by air. Military
   members may accompany their dependents when any one of the dependents is approved to
   use surface travel. If the verification is from a civilian physician, a government physician
   must also verify the need for surface travel.
   3.12.2. Civilian employees or their dependents may use ship transportation at government
   expense for PCS travel when they have verification of a medical condition precluding travel
   by air. If the verification is from a civilian physician, a government physician must also
   verify the need, for ship travel.
   3.12.3. The orders-issuing authority or authorizing official must include authorization for
   ship movement in the travel order. The LGRD/CTO must instruct travelers to meet the port
   call and have passports, visas, immunization records, etc., in their possession before they
   begin travel. The member must satisfy all border clearance requirements and obtain
   necessary travel and entry documents.
3.13. Privately Owned Conveyance (POC) Travel Involving a Car Ferry. Per diem and
reimbursement entitlements can be found in the JFTR, par. U5116-C3 and JTR, par. C4558-D.
POC travel of this type does not exhaust the POV shipping entitlement in the JFTR, par. U5400
for a uniformed member. (Please see JTR, par. C5200 for employees.)
3.14. Alaska Marine Highway System. The Alaska Marine Highway System (AMHS) is an
oceangoing car ferry service for transporting passengers, baggage, vehicles, and pets between the
states of Washington and Alaska. Reservations may be arranged by the local CTO, or by
contacting AMHS, phone at 1-800-642-0066 or (907) 465-8820. The primary method of
payment is the Government Travel Card (GTC). Reimbursement is limited to costs to move the
member, authorized dependents, and a POV (pet shipments not included). Fees for use of the
AMHS to transport one POV to a new PDS are reimbursable under JFTR, par. U5116-C3.
Reimbursement of these fees does not preclude use of the POV shipping entitlement authorized
in the JFTR, par. U5410 for uniformed members. (See JTR, par. C5200 for employee‘s shipping
entitlement.)
3.15. Pet Shipments. Pet shipment on AMC flights is limited to two pets per family in
permanent change of station status only. The traveler is responsible for all expenses related to the
pet shipment and must comply with the carrier regulations. Reimbursement for shipping a pet is
not authorized for military members however, civilian personnel are authorized IAW JTR
C5310D-8. The member may be reimbursed up to $550 for mandatory pet quarantine incident to
PCS. Also, the traveler must ensure all general entry and health requirements are met prior to pet
shipment. LGRD/CTO must assist with scheduling pets on AMC airlift. The combined weight
of pet and container up to 150 pounds must be charged as excess checked baggage. The cost of
excess baggage varies depending on the AMC channel and destination. AMC restricts weight for
pets with kennels (container) up to 150 pounds. If pet spaces are unavailable or the pet exceeds
weight restrictions (to include kennel/container), the traveler is solely responsible for shipping
the pet with a commercial airline carrier. Non-availability of AMC pet space is not grounds for
 42                                                            AFI24-101 19 OCTOBER 2012


members to deviate from the DoD order of precedence outlined in paragraph 2.3 Reference DTR
4500-9-R, Part I, Chapter 103, paragraph J1. Pets defined as cats or dogs only.
3.16. Temporary Duty (TDY) Travel. Air is the primary transportation mode for DoD
personnel. Surface transportation may be approved by authorizing/order-issuing official or a
competent authority for operational requirements (e.g., mission must be performed on a ship,
medical, etc.), not for personal conveniences.
   3.16.1. TDY travel should originate from the most rate-favorable point serving the member‘s
   duty station or place ordered to duty to obtain the best value travel arrangements for mission
   accomplishment. Travel orders must specify where authorized travel may originate and list
   all official travel segments. For privately owned conveyance travel refer to JFTR, Chapter 4,
   Part K or JTR, Chapter 4, Part H. NOTE: Circuitous travel is not part of TDY entitlements
   and is not authorized at government expense.
   3.16.2. Reasonable adjustments to the traveler‘s schedule must be made by travelers and
   their orders issuing official to ensure maximum utilization of Patriot Express airlift for
   transoceanic travel. The traveler must review mission needs and validate the reason for non-
   use of Patriot Express airlift in writing to LGRD (Use Attachment 2 for Mission Impact
   Statement). Unit commanders/authorizing officials must review and approve all travel
   requests.
   3.16.3. Bearing in mind that the use of CTO is mandatory DoD policy, the squadron
   commander or equivalent authority must approve authorization to self-procure transoceanic
   transportation with sufficient justification. Approval authority must not be delegated.
   LGRDs must provide a statement only if the traveler‘s official travel requirements cannot be
   satisfied. Orders must be annotated with the following statement: ―Traveler authorized to
   personally procure transoceanic transportation.‖ (Reference AFI 65-103, paragraph 3.3.16)
       3.16.4. Travelers ordered to TDY while on Leave (JFTR. Par. U4105-F) applies only if
       the need for the TDY is unknown to the member prior to the member‘s departure on
       leave. If the TDY is known by the member before departure on leave, the member is
       reimbursed actual travel expenses NTE the constructed round-trip cost between the PDS
       and TDY location. City Pair airfares are not authorized for use to/from the leave point if
       the TDY requirement is known before leave is begun (APP P2).
3.17. Funded Emergency Leave (EL) Travel. When eligible members and dependents
permanently assigned to an OCONUS location receive notification of a family emergency away
from their duty station they may request travel orders to the emergency location. Once the
member‘s commander or the delegated authority has determined emergency travel is authorized,
the member and/or family member(s) are entitled to government funded round-trip transportation
in accordance with JFTR, par. U7205 and DTR 4500.9-R, Part 1, Chapter 102. See AFI 36-
3003, Military Leave Program, for specific guidelines. NOTE: Members and employees on
TDY and in certain instances members and dependents stationed in the CONUS may have an
emergency leave entitlement. Different entitlements apply to emergency leave; consult the DTR
4500.9-R and JFTR or JTR for specifics.
   3.17.1. When AMC contracted airlift is not available, commercial air must be used. Do not
   delay the EL traveler(s) pending available Patriot Express missions.
AFI24-101 19 OCTOBER 2012                                                                        43


   3.17.2. Clarification for authorized origins and destinations can be found in the JFTR, pars.
   U7205 and U7206, and JTR, par. C7350-C, and must be used to determine all authorized
   entitlements.
   3.17.3. Reference DoD 4515.13-R, Table 2-1 when travel is on a DoD-owned or -controlled
   aircraft to determine eligibility and privileges.
   3.17.4. When transiting the CONUS to travel from one overseas theater to another overseas
   theater, travel will be at government expense.
   3.17.5. EL is authorized from OCONUS PDS to either:
       3.17.5.1. The CONUS international airport nearest to the location from which the
       member/dependent departed to which a scheduled direct flight is available along a
       normally traveled international route; or
       3.17.5.2. Any other CONUS airport closer to the traveler's destination if the
       transportation cost to the other airport is less than the transportation cost to the
       international airport described above. Note: This creates a cost limit to be used for
       transportation.
   3.17.6. It is important the CTO work with each traveler to provide the best travel
   options/costs:
       3.17.6.1. First, the CTO will establish a baseline/authorized travel cost using GSA City
       Pair from the PDS to the nearest CONUS international airport.
       3.17.6.2. Second, the CTO will search GSA City Pairs, military furlough and public fares
       that best accommodate the traveler's desires (times, dates, and destination).
       3.17.6.3. If the cost is cheaper to the EL destination vice the authorized baseline cost, the
       CTO will issue the tickets at no additional cost to the member (the CTO may use the City
       Pair fare if the cost is less than the baseline cost) (JFTR U7205).
       3.17.6.4. If the cost to the EL destination is higher, the CTO will annotate the PNR with
       the authorized cost and ensure member understands and pays the additional costs (do not
       use a City Pair fare if higher than the baseline City Pair).
   3.17.7. The travel order must reflect the authorized travel cost to allow the Air Force
   Financial Services Center to properly pay the traveler(s).
   3.17.8. Use the member's GTC for EL travel costs whenever possible.
3.18. Funded Dependent Student Travel. Eligible uniformed service members and employees
stationed overseas are authorized round-trip transportation for their student dependents attending
formal education programs, to include vocational education. An annual trip for educational travel
is one round-trip at anytime within a fiscal year to and from the members duty station (1 Oct
through 30 Sep). Uniformed service members need to contact their personnel office for program
details. NOTE: The dependent student transportation entitlement does not apply to cadets
attending service academies as stated in JFTR, par. U5260-D.4.d. Also see JTR, par. C5120.
   3.18.1. The overseas MPS must issue travel orders with fund citations for authorized student
   travel.

3.19. Renewal Agreement Travel (RAT). Civilian employees who are eligible for Renewal
Agreement Travel (RAT) must obtain official travel orders from their servicing personnel office
stating authorized travel location and/or reimbursement allowance. Employees may select an
alternate point, but must be stated in the orders. However, travel to the alternate point cannot
exceed the authorized cost for travel between the old PDS and the place of actual residence and
return to the old or new PDS as the case may be. Multiple alternate points are not authorized.
Employees must arrange travel through LGRD/CTO. Reference the JTR, Chapter 5, Part K, for
guidance.
3.20. Invitational Travel Authorization (ITAs). Invitational travel is official travel primarily
involving non-governmental personnel, including spouses and other family members as stated in
JTR/JFTR, Appendix E. If approved, the LGRD/CTO must arrange official travel for
individuals traveling on ITAs IAW the procedures in paragraph 2.1 Commander, MAJCOM;
Commander, Intermediate Echelon; and Commander of a Wing, Group or Squadron may issue
ITAs when delegated by the responsible major air command. Requests for travel approval
should be submitted at least 20 working days prior to the anticipated date of travel. All requests
must be forwarded through appropriate channels in the same manner as requests for exception to
policy. NOTE: The approval process may be different when use of MILAIR is desired (see DoD
4515.13-R, Chapter 10).
3.21. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Travel. DoD personnel whose travel is funded by Foreign
Military Sales (FMS) case money provided by a foreign government are bound by the normal
routing for DoD travelers, unless otherwise stated in the U.S. Government, Letter of Offer and
Agreement. These terms must be annotated on the travel orders; otherwise LGRD/CTO must
procure transportation according to the order of precedence as specified in Chapter 2, paragraph
2.3, producing the best value for expending funds. Refer to AFMAN 16-101, Internal Affairs and
Security Assistance Management, and AFI 16-201, Air Force Foreign Disclosure and
Technology Transfer Program, chapter 5, paragraph 5.8, for more information.
   3.21.1. FMS-funded travel is chargeable directly to the FMS funds shown in the travel
   orders. In addition, FMS travel that is not funded by the U.S. Government is eligible for
   GSA Airline City Pair Program fares when the traveler is a DoD uniformed service member
   or a DoD civilian. Contractors may not use City Pair fares.
3.22. Transporting Human Remains, Escorts, and Relatives of Personnel Attending Group
Burials. Transportation Officers/Installation Transportation Officers and mortuary affair
officers satisfy travel provisions in AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs Program, JFTR, Chapters 4, 5,
& 7, and JTR, Chapter 6. LGRD must work closely with mortuary affairs for arranging
transportation of human remains. Government aircraft is normally used to move human remains
between OCONUS points or to the CONUS aerial port of debarkation (APOD), and in certain
overseas locations, commercial air cargo must be used. The normal mode for movement of
human remains within CONUS is commercial air or other means that meet specific requirements.
   3.22.1. Escorts (military or civilian) for the remains of deceased Air Force military
   personnel or their family members are authorized travel as provided in the JFTR, par. U5950
   3.22.2. Escorts (military or civilian) for the remains of deceased civilian personnel are
   authorized travel expenses as provided in the JTR, par. C5880.

3.23. Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA). IMAs may use GSA Airline City Pair
Program fares when traveling to perform Inactive Duty Training. DoDI 4515.16, Use of General
Services Administration (GSA) Contracts for Air Passenger Transportation Services (GSA City
Pair Program) for Attendance at Inactive Duty (IDT) Assemblies, and AF/A4L Message
R191135Z         Nov       99       outline      these      procedures.            Reference
http://arpc.afrc.af.mil/orders/travel.htm for more information.
3.24. Ready Reserves Called to Active Duty. Members of the Air Force Reserves and Air
National Guards coordinate travel arrangements when they receive orders to perform active duty.
LGRD/CTO provides round trip reservations for members on DoD –owned, -controlled, or –
contracted aircraft when DoD service is not available to meet civilian employment commitments.
3.25. Non-Appropriated Funds (NAF) Employees. NAF military members and U.S. civilian
NAF officials or employees performing official travel on orders are mandatory users of GSA
Airline City Pair Program and must follow the order of precedence for air travel as stated in
paragraph 2.3 Non-U.S. citizen employees of NAF activities are authorized NAF funded
transportation in overseas areas in accordance with the terms of the employment contract. NAF
travelers may travel on MILAIR or contracted aircraft when issued NAF travel orders. NAF
contractors may not travel on ITAs and cannot use GSA Airline City Pairs fares. NAF orders
cannot be charged on an Air Force CBA. See DoD 4515.13-R, Chapter 2 for additional
information.
3.26. Contractor Travel. Government contractors may travel by MILAIR and AMC contracted
chartered aircraft when issued a Letter of Authorization (LOA) and are eligible under DoD
4515.13- R, Chapter 2, paragraph B.9. See JTR/JFTR, Appendix E, Part I, for requirements when
issuing an LOA. Government contractors are prohibited from using GSA Airline City Pair
Program fares. Contractors may submit an LOA to a vendor for a discount on rail, hotel/motel or
car rental. However, the vendor is under no obligation to give the contractor a government
discount. Some carriers may offer a reduced airfare.
3.27. Air Force Aero-Club Aircraft or Other Fly-It-Yourself Rental Aircraft. Use of rental
aircraft must be approved in the travel order IAW AFI 65-103. LGRD is not required to make
arrangements for such services but should brief travelers on authorized reimbursements
according to JFTR, par. U3210 and JTR, par. C4703-B.
3.28. Accompanied Baggage. Accompanied baggage is the free checkable baggage authorized
for movement with a traveler as part of their transportation ticket. Most Airlines no longer offer
free checked baggage, therefore official travelers should be prepared to pay the charge at check
in and file for reimbursement on the travel voucher. Some airlines offer waivers for active duty
military traveling on orders, but this is a courtesy, and is usually determined at the ticket counter.
Each Airline Carrier‘s baggage allowance vary therefore, travelers are encouraged to plan ahead
and contact their carrier directly or visit their web site to determine the allowed baggage before
traveling. Baggage allowance rules for international travel on foreign carriers vary by country
and may authorize less weight and use kilograms to monitor weight versus pounds. Verify
weight restrictions and the weight of your baggage with the airline before traveling.
Note: Carrier baggage allowance vary therefore, passengers should refer questions to respective
carriers for baggage allowance.

   3.28.1. Excess accompanied baggage must be approved by the orders issuing official and
   annotated in the traveler‘s orders, IAW AFI 65-103, AFI 65-109, AFI 65-114, and AFI 36-
   2102. Travel orders must be annotated with the following statement, ―___pieces, ___lbs.
   excess accompanied baggage authorized‖. Travelers must pay the excess baggage charges
   directly to the servicing airline at the time of flight check-in and claim reimbursement on the
   travel voucher. The preferred payment for excess baggage is the government travel card. The
   traveler may also elect to mail the excess baggage at any U.S. postal office and file for
   reimbursement (See DTR 4500.9-R, Part 1, Chapter 103-F.1; JFTR, para. U3105 and JTR,
   para. C3105
   3.28.2. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) security regulations generally prohibit
   travelers from carrying operable weapons in the passenger compartment of civil aircraft
   during peacetime. Individual airlines may grant exceptions to their regulations when a
   traveler requires a weapon for official duties during flight. LGRD/CTO must contact the
   appropriate carrier when coordinating flight reservations to ensure authorized personnel may
   bring weapons aboard.
   3.28.3. Code of Federal Regulations 14, Chapter 108, Part 108.11 permits carriers to allow
   DoD travelers to carry weapons in passenger compartments when the entire civil aircraft is
   chartered or contracted for the military services during contingency operations or for training
   exercises.
   3.28.4. Commercial airlines may permit travelers to transport government-owned weapons
   and ammunition in baggage compartments when CTO or LGRD notifies the carrier in
   advance. Ammunition for individual weapons cannot be transported in checked baggage or
   as a carry-on on board AMC Patriot Express missions departing AMC gateways.
   Ammunition must be certified and shipped as freight from military installations.
3.29. Vehicle Rental. The base CTO/ LGRD are responsible for obtaining rental vehicles for
official travel when authorized in the traveler‘s orders. They reserve the most economical vehicle
that can satisfy the traveler‘s official requirement. The CTO will consider rental vehicles under
the DoD Car Rental Agreement when making the reservations.
   3.29.1. In the United States and several foreign countries limited collision insurance is
   available to travelers at no additional charge under the DoD Car Rental Agreement. Personal
   accident insurance, personal effects coverage, or other optional coverage may be offered to
   the renter but is not a prerequisite for renting a vehicle, and its cost is not reimbursed. In
   countries where theft insurance is a mandatory charge, those charges can be shown separately
   from the rental rate and collision damage waiver charges. Outside of the United States (and
   outside non-foreign OCONUS areas), travelers may be reimbursed for these additional
   charges if the insurance is required by the rental agency to provide full coverage insurance.
   In foreign OCONUS areas, travelers may be reimbursed for additional mandatory insurance
   coverage charges. Reimbursement may also be authorized for certain classified special
   operations.
   3.29.2. Air Force travelers on official business who rent vehicles at an overseas location may
   need an international driver's license, which they can obtain from most automobile clubs.
AFI24-101 19 OCTOBER 2012                                                                      47


   3.29.3. The traveler must coordinate use of rental vehicles for other than official business
   with the rental car companies. Any additional charges or requirements for collision insurance
   are the sole responsibility of the traveler.
   3.29.4. Damage to rental vehicles. Requests for payment for damage to vehicles rented
   pursuant to orders are approved by the orders authorizing official. The requests may be from
   the traveler or from the rental company. Prior to acting, the orders authorizing official
   forwards the request to the Staff Judge Advocate and DTMO for review. The package should
   contain the documents outlined in the DoD Financial Management Regulation Volume 9,
   Chapter 4
3.30. Frequent Flyer Program Benefits. Government travelers on official business at
government expense that are frequent flyer program members may keep points or miles,
upgrades, or access to carrier clubs or facilities for personal use. The promotional material must
be obtained under the same terms as those offered to the general public and must be at no cost to
the government. Air Force personnel when using their frequent flyer miles to upgrade to business
or First Class shall not wear a uniform or allow a rank or grade to be associated with an upgrade.
Please note that membership in frequent flyer programs is not justification to override the
requirement (in future reservations) to utilize assigned contract carriers through the GSA City
Pairs Program.
3.31. Multiple Airports Servicing CONUS Origins/Destinations. Passengers should not be
routed to an airport farther away from origin or destination airports based solely on a lower
airfare. When arranging transportation, the CTO must route passengers using the best value that
meets mission requirements within established guidelines, local policies and business rules
which may include, but not limited to, authorized/establish commuting radius. Per diem, travel
time, most direct route, authorized GSA contract carrier versus alternate carrier/airport, and
rental car costs should be considered in factoring best value. If a traveler‘s request does not
follow the order of precedence for travel in paragraph 2.3, or the airfare is more expensive, the
final determination rests with the AO/order issuing official.
3.32. Unique Control Numbers (UCN). Upon confirming reservations, GATES automatically
assigns a UCN for travelers. LGRD annotates travel orders as required in DTR 4500.9-R for
travel aboard AMC international airlift.
   3.32.1. The UCN is annotated on four copies of the travel order in the upper left hand corner
   and is distributed as follows:
       3.32.1.1. LGRDs retains one station file copy.
       3.32.1.2. Two copies to the member, one to turn in at the AMC terminal prior to travel
       and the other one to file with their travel voucher.
       3.32.1.3. LGRDs forward a copy to the local FSO for TDY travelers only.
3.33. Travel on Military Aircraft (MILAIR). Patriot Express is an AMC-contracted
commercial air service and is not considered MILAIR. MILAIR travel, often provided by
Operational Support Airlift (OSA), is a premium mode involving high cost and limited resources
(reference paragraph 3.37). MILAIR is used for high-priority missions and movement of
passengers and cargo to meet mission sensitive requirements. MILAIR should not be used when
commercial air, including AMC-contracted (Patriot Express) service, is able to meet the
 48                                                           AFI24-101 19 OCTOBER 2012


traveler‘s departure and/or arrival requirements within a 24-hour period. Exceptions that would
make commercial air transportation impractical would include an unusual circumstance that
presents a clear and present danger, an emergency exists, use of MILAIR is more cost-effective
than commercial air, or other similar compelling operational considerations.
   3.33.1. Required Use MILAIR Travelers. The SECAF and CSAF are the only Air Force
   required users as designated by SECDEF in DoDD 4500.56 Enclosure 3. Travelers must
   document their travel on DD Form 2768 and sign their request as the senior traveler and
   authorizing official. Due to their continuous requirement for secure communications, security
   reasons or for responsive transportation to satisfy exceptional scheduling requirements
   dictated by frequent short-notice travel, making commercial transportation unacceptable.
   Reference DoDD 4500.56, enclosure 3 for a list of DoD officials designated as ―Required
   Users‖ (Tiers 1 & 2) by the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF).
   3.33.2. Use DD Form 2768, Military Air Passenger/Cargo Request, to obtain and
   document airlift support. Members may not make back-up commercial reservations when
   travelers have requested any type of MILAIR support. (Prohibition of Dual Commitment
   reference 3.1)
3.34. MILAIR Payment . LGRD/CTO must ensure all travel orders contain a Customer
Identification Code (CIC). The 15-digit CIC code is required by AMC for billing purposes. If the
travel order does not contain a CIC, advise the traveler to, and/or, contact the AO to request
amendments to the order. For contractor billing procedures, reference DoD 4515.13-R, Chapter
2, paragraph B.9.C. For non-DoD traveler billing procedures, reference the non-DoD tariff rates
in GATES or the web site at U.S. Government DoD Airlift Rates and Non-U.S. Government
Airlift Rates https://www.amcfm.scott.af.mil/FMB.htm. In cases where a CIC is unavailable,
the complete billing address must be annotated in the travel order for AMC billing purposes.
3.35. Opportune Airlift. This is a generic term for all MILAIR not otherwise classified as
OSA, Special Assignment Airlift Mission (SAAM), AMC channel, Special Airlift Mission
(SAM), etc. It is space-available, non-revenue generating SAAM traffic. Use the procedures in
DTR 4500.9-R, Part I, Appendix A and B for requesting a SAAM.
   3.35.1. Users may submit an unsupported travel requirement to their SAAM validator. They
   may also find their own MILAIR (e.g., ANG, AFRES, operational, etc.) and submit the
   mission for validation to their SAAM validator.
3.36. Operational Support Airlift (OSA). OSA is a form of MILAIR. See DoDI 4500.43 and
DoDD 4500.56.
   3.36.1. Travelers must document their travel on DD Form 2768 and sign their request as the
   senior traveler and authorizing official.
   3.36.2. MILAIR travel requests for all Air Force personnel must be approved in advance.
   SECAF designates the following Air Force approval authorities for the use of government
   aircraft and air travel, as it relates to the approval of use of MILAIR via DD Form 2768,
   MILITARY AIR PASSENGER/CARGO REQUEST to meet DoD Policy requirements (IAW
   DoDI 4500.43, May 18, 2011 and DoDD 4500.56 Incorporating Change 1, May 11, 2010):
       3.36.2.1. SECAF approves SAF/US and SAF/AA requests;
       3.36.2.2. SAF/AA approves Secretariat requests;
AFI24-101 19 OCTOBER 2012                                                                        49


       3.36.2.3. CSAF approves AF/CV requests;
       3.36.2.4. AF/CV approves MAJCOM/CC‘s requests (when travel is primarily for Air
       Force purposes) and AF/CVA requests;
       3.36.2.5. AF/CVA approves Air Staff, FOA and DRU requests;
       3.36.2.6. MAJCOM/CC‘s approve their MAJCOM/CV requests;
       3.36.2.7. . MAJCOM/CV‘s approve their MAJCOM staff and subordinate requests; and,
       3.36.2.8. Combatant Commander (COCOM) approves MAJCOM/CC‘s requests when
       travel is primarily for COCOM purposes.
   3.36.3. All travelers (except those in PACAF and USAFE) submit their MILAIR requests to
   AF/CVAM for validation and routing to the appropriate office for approval.
   3.36.4. MILAIR requests must include a commercial air cost estimate, full justification for
   use of MILAIR and a statement that alternate means such as VTC or web-based
   communications are not sufficiently able to accomplish travel objectives. See both DoDI
   4500.43 and DoDD 4500.56, Enclosure 3 for determining commercial air travel costs.
3.37. Common User Airlift on Operational Support Aircraft (OSA) Missions. Common
User Airlift may support OSA group travel requirements (e.g., CAPSTONE, TOPS IN BLUE,
CIVIC LEADER PROGRAMS) and other validated OSA missions. The Air Force supports such
missions and other travel requirements as Special Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAM). The
following exception applies to CAPSTONE CONUS Field Trip Travel only: "When
CAPSTONE fellows are moved aboard mobility aircraft for the purpose of demonstrating the
capabilities of the aircraft and the enroute support structure, the point-to-point transportation of
the fellows becomes incidental to the capability demonstration. Therefore, use of training
missions in this case is appropriate. Training flights used to carry CAPSTONE fellows should
not include repetitive sorties on which the fellows are seeing similar elements of the Air Mobility
Mission".
   3.37.1. Essential Air Mobility activities on such capability demonstration sorties (e.g., Intra-
   or InterTheatre airlift, Airdrops, and Air Refueling) provide aircrews the opportunity to fulfill
   training requirements. On those capability demonstration missions identified by AMC for
   each CAPSTONE course, training missions must be logged using training hours. All
   CAPSTONE missions are handled as SAAMs for the purposes of command and control in
   order to ensure the success of these high-priority/visibility missions.
   3.37.2. MAJCOMS, in coordination with users, must program funds for group travel
   missions they sponsor, including civic leader groups. AMC must also POM for NON-
   MAJCOM group travel SAAM requirements such as DoD, HQ USAF, and other NON-
   MAJCOM sponsored OSA missions.
3.38. Customs and Border Clearance. OCONUS travelers must meet all customs and border
clearance requirements. Travelers must have passports, visas, immunization records and all other
required travel documentation in their possession before they begin their travel. See DoD
4500.54-G, DoD 5030.49-R, AFI 24-401, AFI 24-402, AFI 24-403, and AFI 24-404 for further
guidance.

3.39. Security Considerations for OCONUS Travel. Security of DoD travelers overrides all
other routing considerations. See DoD 4500.54-G for guidance.
3.40. Entitlement Extensions for Retirements and Separations. Extension requests beyond
established entitlement expirations must clearly demonstrate hardship circumstances for the
uniformed service member and/or dependents. A written justification along with supporting
documentation (i.e., proof of home of record, place of entry, medical, educational, training,
spousal employment, housing, etc) is required. The Home of Selection Travel and
Transportation Entitlements worksheet is required prior to retirement. Forward extension
requests to the following, based on the subject.
   3.40.1. The Personal Property Activity Headquarters (PPA HQ)/Excess Cost Adjudicating
   Function (ECAF) San Antonio is the extension approval authority for household goods when
   a member is hospitalized, receiving medical treatment, home of record (HOR), place from
   which called or ordered to active duty (PLEAD), education and training purposes, or for
   other deserving cases (e.g. construction of retirement home).

3.41. Defense Office of Hearing and Appeals (DOHA) Claims. Under Title 31, US Code,
Section 3702, DOHA settles travel and transportation claims for members of the uniformed
services. Prior to July 1996, the General Accounting Office settled such claims under that statute.
The Accounting and Finance Office is the point of contact for all DOHA claims.
3.42. Application for Correction of Military Record. The Air Force Board for Correction of
Military Record (AFBCMR) is established under the authority contained in Title 10, US Code,
Section 1552. This statutory authority is the highest administrative appeal in the USAF for
reimbursing official travel and transportation claims including DOHA rulings when justified.
The final determination is based on the information submitted to the AFBCMR, and each case is
decided only after careful consideration of the evidence presented, with the burden of proof
resting on the applicant. MPS is the POC for processing DD Form 149, Application for
Correction of Military Record. See AFI 36-2903, Air Force Board for Correction of Military
Records for processing instructions.
3.43. Instructions to Travelers. LGRD /CTO give travelers essential travel information on the
following:
       3.43.1. Traveler's responsibility for safeguarding, handling, and using all travel
       documents including GTRs (SF 1169), carrier tickets, and meal tickets as applicable.
   3.43.2. Reservations, cancellations and overbooking policies.
   3.43.3. Routings, itineraries, transfer points, local transportation to include ground
   transportation, and rental vehicles.
   3.43.4. The traveler may keep promotional material including frequent flyer miles and
   payments from the carrier for voluntarily vacating a seat. Additional per diem may not be
AFI24-101 19 OCTOBER 2012                                                                   51


  paid as a result of the delay in the travel in this case. See JTR, pars. C1200 and C1205, and
  JFTR, pars. U1200 and U1205 for more detailed information.
  3.43.5. The traveler may not keep compensation for "denied boarding‖ when an airline does
  not allow a traveler to board an overbooked flight the airline owes the government
  compensation. Travelers must turn in any form of compensatory payment they receive from
  carriers to the finance office with their travel voucher.
  3.43.6. Turn in any unused documents to LGRD/CTO at their permanent duty station.

                                           Chapter 4

                      TRAVEL DOCUMENTATION AND BILLING

4.1. General. Documentation of travel with associated charges and payments is a joint
responsibility of the traveler, authorizing official, LGRD, CTO and FSO. Documentation,
whether in paper or electronic form, is used for travel authorization, travel vendor charges and
payments, traveler reimbursement, auditing purposes, and data collection for management
information system reports.
   4.1.1. In an effort to streamline travel policy and procedures, LGRDs must take positive
   steps to eliminate use of the GTR (SF Form 1169). The elimination of the GTR is consistent
   with efforts to reengineer the transportation documentation and financial processes and to
   embrace charge vehicles for payment of transportation services. Thus, the preferred payment
   method for passenger travel is the Government Travel Card (GTC). If, however, a GTR is
   used as the payment method, the policy and procedures for GTR usage at paragraph 4.3 must
   be followed.
   4.1.2. Mandatory Use of the GTC. The Travel and Transportation Act of 1998 (Public Law
   105-264) requires use of the GTC as the method of payment/reimbursement for official travel
   expenses. The GTC encompasses the Individually Billed Account (IBA), the Centrally Billed
   Account (CBA) and the Unit Card. The requirement for mandatory use of the travel card
   applies to uniformed service members, DoD civilian personnel, and members of the USAFR
   and ANG while in federal service (Title 10 status). Use of the IBA is the mandatory method
   of payment/reimbursement for cardholders.
   4.1.3. Transportation charges are as follows.
       4.1.3.1. Transportation charges for airline, bus and rail tickets may be billed to the CBA.
       The local LGRD must determine valid use of the CBA and reconciliation procedures
       (Attachment 5).
       4.1.3.2. Use of the IBA is mandatory as a method of reimbursement for official travel
       associated charges where a charge card can be used such as: ticketing, lodging, rental car,
       meals, etc. The IBA can only be used to obtain ticketing and services directly associated
       with official government funded travel.
       4.1.3.3. The Unit Card is intended for use in group travel situations. Examples are
       presidential aircrews, academy athletic teams, and bands. The unit card can be used for
       official charges associated with travel.
       4.1.3.4. The traveler is required to use the CTO for making official travel arrangements
       and ticketing if the CTO is available. When the CTO is available, but the traveler
       arranges transportation through a non-contract travel agent or common carrier direct
       purchase, reimbursement is limited to the amount the government would have paid if the
       arrangements had been made directly through a CTO. The IBA, CBA, and Unit Card are
       the only methods of payment to be used.
NOTE: Advance approval by the AO is required for all travelers desiring to self-procure official
travel, and it must be included in the official travel order.
AFI24-101 19 OCTOBER 2012                                                                      53


       4.1.3.5. MAJCOM commanders may decide whether transportation charges for official
       transportation travel are billed to CBAs or IBAs or a mix. MAJCOM commanders may
       also delegate this decision to their base or installation commanders.
       4.1.3.6. CBA and IBA Reconciliation and Refund Procedures. LGRD, in conjunction
       with the CTO and FSO, must develop local procedures in meeting installation
       requirements and guidelines outlined by the Prompt Payment Act. See Attachment 5.
4.2. Maintaining Records. At a minimum, LGRD must retain a copy of orders for CBA and
either a copy of the ticket, passenger name record (PNR), or AF Form 529, Request for Air
Carrier Services, for each CBA transaction processed. Additional documentation such as
justification for non-use of GSA Airline City Pair Program fares, Patriot Express missions, etc.
must also be retained. GTR and CBA ticketing documentation must be grouped and filed
together for reconciliation purposes and forwarded as determined by the supporting FSO and
DFAS Field Site. There is no requirement to retain a copy of orders, PNR or additional
documentation for tickets purchased via IBA.
4.3. Deployment & Distribution Flight (LGRD) Control of Government Transportation
Request (GTR, (SF 1169)), Meal Tickets, Passenger Warrants. Blank GTRs (SF 1169), meal
tickets, and Passenger Warrants (formerly MTWs) are examples of accountable forms. Maintain
a complete audit trail when they are transferred.
   4.3.1. LGRD must store blank GTRs (SF 1169) in a locked container.
   4.3.2. Record each GTR (SF 1169) issued on an automated form or AF Form 1332,
   Government Transportation Request and Meal Ticket/Register.
   4.3.3. Dispose of records in accordance with AFI 33-364, Records Disposition – Procedures
   and Responsibilities.
   4.3.4. Do not issue GTRs (SF 1169) for the following:
       4.3.4.1. For unofficial or leisure travel.
       4.3.4.2. For preparation by individual travelers, except when the traveler is appointed as
       an acting transportation officer.
       4.3.4.3. To travel agencies. This restriction does not apply to travel agencies approved by
       AF/A4LE.
       4.3.4.4. For military furlough and leave fares.
       4.3.4.5. To members being separated or released from active duty, unless the finance
       office certifies separation Monetary Allowance in Lieu of Transportation (MALT)
       entitlements will not be paid. File a copy of the certification with the issued tickets.
       4.3.4.6. For transportation costs less than $50.
4.4. Disposing of Unused GTRs (SF 1169), Transportation Warrants, Exchange Orders,
Carrier Transportation Credit Refund Applications, and Carrier Tickets. Travelers must
understand these forms are accountable and must turn in any unused documents to the
LGRD/CTO at their permanent duty station. Turn in should occur within five days to ensure
proper credit is processed in a timely manner against the government travel card. Sign and attach
 54                                                              AFI24-101 19 OCTOBER 2012


a statement to the ticket, indicating the date, hour and reason for canceling or changing seating or
sleeping accommodations.
   4.4.1. LGRDs/CTOs receiving unused travel documents must do the following:
       4.4.1.1. Document receipt for unused tickets (Use of DD Form 730, Receipt for Unused
       Transportation Request and/or Tickets, Including Unused Meal Tickets, is optional).
       4.4.1.2. File the receipt per local procedures for receipt of unused tickets.
       4.4.1.3. Send the receipt, voided unused ticket(s) and other pertinent documentation to
       the issuing LGRD/CTO for proper disposition.
4.5. Destroying Unused, Damaged, or Canceled Travel Documents. Units may transfer all
Unused GTRs to HQ AFCENT A4RA/T since they are used within their AOR. Coordinate
transfer with HQ AFCENT A4RA/T by emailing: usafcenta4rat@afcent.af.mil. Mark
"Canceled" or "Void" across the face of the original unused, damaged, or canceled GTRs (SF
1169), transportation warrants, and meal tickets. (Refer to DTR 4500.9-R, Part I, Appendix L).
Dispose of them in accordance with AFI 33-364 Records Disposition – Procedures and
Responsibilities. Dispose of the remaining copies as ordinary trash.
4.6. Reporting Tickets or GTRs (SF 1169) Lost or Stolen
   4.6.1. For lost or stolen GTRs (SF 1169), LGRD sends a report immediately, by message, to
   the paying office shown on the "billed to" portion of the transportation procurement
   document. Include payee's name (if applicable), the serial number of missing documents, and
   a statement explaining the loss or theft. For loss of commercial airline tickets, LGRD must
   file a lost ticket application and initiate follow-up actions, as needed.
       4.6.1.1. If lost or stolen GTRs (SF 1169) were fully or partially completed, provide the
       serial numbers to the CTO, carrier or local travel agents and advise them not to honor
       identified lost/stolen documents. Follow-up, in writing, and forward information to the
       appropriate Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Office.
       4.6.1.2. LGRD‘s who have blank GTRs (SF 1169) lost or stolen while in their custody
       must immediately notify, in writing, their local publication distribution office (PDO), and
       their appropriate finance office (i.e., DFAS), Offutt AFB, NE 68005-1920. Give the serial
       number or numbers of the missing GTRs (SF 1169) and circumstances surrounding the
       loss or theft.
   4.6.2. Tickets or GTRs (SF 1169) Lost While in Custody of Traveler.
       4.6.2.1. Travelers who lose their tickets/GTR (SF 1169) must notify the carrier and
       issuing LGRD/CTO immediately, and complete a carrier lost ticket refund application.
       Travelers must purchase transportation with personal funds. If travelers do not have
       sufficient funds, LGRD may issue a replacement ticket on a cost charge basis. See
       paragraph 4.11 for cost charge authorization procedures, and reference DTR 4500.9-R.
       4.6.2.2. After completing the travel, they may request reimbursement on their travel
       voucher upon receipt of airline non-use verification. Dependents of service members may
       obtain cost charge transportation under JFTR, par. U5237; and civilian employees under
       JTR, pars. C2255 and C2256. NOTE: Civilian travelers must also ask civilian personnel
       for specific documentation needed for cost charge transportation.
AFI24-101 19 OCTOBER 2012                                                                    55


4.7. Carrier’s Compliance with GTR (SF 1169). All commercial carriers must comply with
information on the GTR (SF 1169). The Air Force does not pay excess costs that may arise when
the carrier deviates from routes, mode, or accommodations, even though the changes may result
from oral instructions. The carrier may provide transportation or accommodations only for the
exact number of persons shown on the GTR (SF 1169). For emergency situations, LGRD will
keep a minimum of 25 GTRs on file.
4.8. Furnishing Transportation to Military Personnel without Funds (Cost-Charge
Travel). When members of the uniformed services report to Air Force bases without funds and
need transportation to their duty station, LGRD provides cost-charge transportation.
   4.8.1. For members with PCS or TDY orders, cite the original order and appropriation
   shown as the authority. LGRD initiates a DD Form 139 for member. The member receiving
   cost-charge transportation must complete a certificate in triplicate, stating that they agree
   either to pay the cost involved or to authorize collection from their pay. Give the original
   certificate to the member and place the duplicate copy in the file with the travel documents,
   and forward a copy of the cost charge GTR (SF 1169), the DD Form 139 and orders to the
   appropriate finance center:
       4.8.1.1. Army personnel: DFAS Centralized Pay Operation; ATTN: JUMPS Cross-
       Disbursing, Dept. 20; Indianapolis, IN 46249-0601.
       4.8.1.2. Navy personnel: Disbursing officer of member's ship or station.
       4.8.1.3. Marine Corps personnel: Marine Corps Finance Center; Code (SD2R); Kansas
       City, MO 64197-0001.
       4.8.1.4. Coast Guard personnel: Commandant (FP), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters,
       2100 2nd St. SW, Washington, DC 20593.
   4.8.2. For members without orders, the LGRD may issue transportation to active duty
   members without funds on ordinary leave, AWOL, deserters, and absentees, to return to their
   permanent duty station. LGRD instructs the member to go to the base MPS for orders. The
   local MPS must issue orders containing appropriations cited by the Headquarters, Air Force
   Personnel Center (AFPC). An officer receiving cost-charge transportation must sign a
   certificate (in triplicate) stating that they agree to pay the cost involved or authorize
   collection from their pay, give the original certificate to the member, forward a copy to
   servicing FSO, and place a copy in the file with the travel documents. See DTR 4500.9-R,
   Part I, Appendix L for more information and an example.
       4.8.2.1. Air Force members receiving a cost-charge fund citation from AFPC do not
       require a DD Form 139 because the use of AFPC fund cites automatically generates
       collection actions against the member‘s pay account.
4.9. Recovered GTRs (SF 1169). For recovered GTRs (SF 1169), LGRDs must follow the
procedures specified in paragraph 4.9 Annotate the AF Form 1332 or locally developed register
appropriately.
4.10. Processing Unused Tickets for Refunds. Below are the recommended procedures for
processing refunds; however, local LGRD/CTO and finance office may implement a different
procedure in accomplishing refunds.
56                                                             AFI24-101 19 OCTOBER 2012


  4.10.1. For installations without a CTO function, complete a SF 1170, Redemption of
  Unused Tickets, or a standard memorandum letter and attach a copy of the lost ticket refund
  application, if available, and copies of the original tickets. Maintain a copy for your suspense
  for 120 days, and send the original documents to the carrier. The SF 1170 can be found on
  the              General              Service                Administration              website:
  http://www.gsa.gov/portal/forms/type/SF#1001-2000.
  4.10.2. Initiate tracer action on unanswered requests for refunds on the 121st day and each
  90 days thereafter, for up to one year from date of the initial SF 1170. If the carrier fails to
  respond within one year, forward all correspondences and documentation with the member's
  case file and annotate copy of SF 1170 with the statement, "No Response Received From
  Carrier," and send the information to the appropriate DFAS in IAW AFI 33-364 Records
  Disposition-Procedures and Responsibility.
  4.10.3. Installations serviced by a CTO. The LGRD, FSO, and CTO/ticket provider jointly
  agree on refund procedures or as specified in the local performance work statement outlined
  by contract.
  4.10.4. The issuing office may follow the recommended procedures below in processing
  unused travel documents and ticket refunds:
     4.10.4.1. Receive unused portion of tickets and a copy of travel orders.
     4.10.4.2. Use DD Form 730 (optional) or locally developed form (e.g., PNR, stamp, pre-
     printed labels, etc.).
     4.10.4.3. Annotate form with pertinent data (e.g., unused segments, cost of unused
     segment, CBA/GTR (SF 1169) number, etc.).
     4.10.4.4. Void/cancel original unused ticket without distorting the pre-printed fare basis
     and ticket value.
     4.10.4.5. Advise traveler to file copy of receipt with travel voucher and maintain a copy
     for personal records.
     4.10.4.6. Mail all unused documents issued at other installations to the issuing
     LGRD/CTO on a transmittal or other means for verifying receipt of accountable forms.
  4.10.5. Recommended refund procedures:
     4.10.5.1. Create a refund suspense list of all unused tickets for the established ticketing
     period (e.g., weekly, monthly, etc.).
     4.10.5.2. As a minimum, the suspense list should contain the traveler‘s name, ticket
     number, and refund amount in duplicate copies.
     4.10.5.3. Provide CTO with the original unused tickets and a copy of the suspense list for
     processing at the end of the billing cycle (the average refund process takes 30 - 45 days).
     4.10.5.4. The LGRD must follow-up on unprocessed ticket refunds beyond 45 days.
     4.10.5.5. Upon receipt of billing documents, verify ticket refunds against LGRD
     suspense list and resolve discrepancies with CTO.
AFI24-101 19 OCTOBER 2012                                                                     57


4.11. Recording Fiscal Data on the GTR (SF 1169). DTR 4500.9-R, Part I, Appendix L,
specifies the general fiscal data entries to make on a GTR (SF 1169) (Block 1) when a LGRD
issues a GTR (SF 1169) for travel or accommodations.
   4.11.1. Send a copy of each GTR, with travel orders, to the local finance office on the day of
   issuance to verify the accounting classification. Refer any questions on propriety of
   accounting classifications to the nearest finance office.
   4.11.2. LGRD may make pen and ink changes to Element Expense Investment Codes
   (EEIC), (e.g. 409 to 421) rather than requiring an amended order.
4.12. Local Payment of Airlines (LOPA) Procedures. See DTR 4500.9R, Appendix L,
paragraph F.
4.13. Meal Tickets Procedures. See DTR 4500.9R, Appendix M.
4.14. Air Transportation Tax on International Travel. On official travel, pay this tax only
when it applies. The domestic portion of an international trip is tax-exempt when the layover at
the transfer point is less than 12 hours.
   4.14.1. This U.S. tax exemption applies to the following:
       4.14.1.1. Connections between commercial airlines at a commercial airport.
       4.14.1.2. Arrival at a commercial airport.
       4.14.1.3. Departure from an international airport.
       4.14.1.4. Departure from an AMC aerial port of embarkation (APOE).
   4.14.2. To ensure carriers extend the tax-exemption privileges to official travelers, identify
   the connecting international flight information on the GTR (SF 1169), AF Form 529, or the
   PNR for the domestic air travel. Place the identifying data on the GTR in the "special
   accommodations and requirements" block. When using the AF Form 529 or PNR, place the
   data in the "itinerary" block. Travelers should contact the legal office for additional
   information.

                                           Chapter 5

                            DEFENSE TRAVEL SYSTEM (DTS)

5.1. Defense Travel System The Defense Travel System (DTS) is designed to make DoD
TDY travel quicker, easier and more efficient. The DTS is based on the Common User
Interface (CUI) and it interfaces with other DoD and commercial systems. The traveler,
approving official (AO), CTO, LGRD, base Finance and DFAS are all connected using
combinations of desk-top computers, internet, and direct connectivity to the CUI. The system
aids the intended traveler by initiating an electronic travel request identifying desired travel
arrangements incorporating Air Force and DoD travel policy, and at travels end, submits an
electronic travel voucher through the CUI. The AO reviews and approves or disapproves the
need for travel, availability of funds based on the CUI travel estimates (―should cost‖) and
appropriate travel arrangements. The CTO ensures Air Force and DoD travel policy is adhered to
and provides booking of travel arrangements for all travel including airline, bus, train, lodging
and car rental. Payment of travel services is accomplished through DFAS and the CUI. DTS
permits payment using the IBA, CBA or GTR (SF 1169). The authorizing or approving official
determines necessary reimbursable expenses. DTS views the traveler and the travel authorizing
or approving official as honest professionals which allows for elimination of tremendous
amounts of documentation to support each expense or exception.
NOTE: DTS is continually being developed and updated. For the most current information on
the DTS processes, fielding and business practices the following web sites are available (DTMO
web sites: http://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/search/search.cfm or
http://www.defensetravel.osd.mil/dts/site/index.jsp)
   5.1.1. DTS (Contracted) Commercial Travel Office (CTO) Contractor. Travelers must
   arrange commercial transportation, rental cars (if authorized), and government and
   commercial lodging through the CTO. In addition to the normal CTO responsibilities, the
   DTS Travel Services Contractor arranges international government airlift under Air Mobility
   Command (AMC) contract/control when it is available and when it satisfies mission
   requirements (if identified in the CTO Performance Work Statement (PWS) or local business
   rules). The CTO must capture, record and report Statistical Collection of Passenger Travel
   (STATCO) Data in accordance with DTR 4500.9-R, Part I, Appendix H. The CTO must
   make Government and commercial lodging reservations with the automated interfaces (when
   available) and must document ―non-availability‖ for Government lodging on trip records
   when appropriate. The CUI must calculate a ―should-cost estimate‖ based on traveler and
   CTO inputs and forward the information to the AO for review. Ticketing must not occur until
   the CTO receives approval from the AO and no earlier than three business days prior to
   travel.
5.2. Defense Travel Administration (DTA).
   5.2.1. DTAs
The local financial management office (or other appropriate office as determined by the field
activity) ensures the proper implementation/administration of the DTS. The activity establishes
the Defense Travel Administration (DTA) which is staffed by functional representatives from
Finance, Transportation, Communications, and Personnel. The DTA defines the workload
AFI24-101 19 OCTOBER 2012                                                                       59


responsibilities of the Organizational Defense Travel Administration (ODTA) and is the AF
Field Activity focal point for deployment of DTS at the site. DTA‘s will coordinate Local DTS
Business Rules with LGRD.
   5.2.2. Lead DTAs
The Lead DTA (LDTA) is responsible for day-to-day DTS operations at the activity. The LDTA
provides customer support regarding system operation, procedures, etc.; sets permission levels
for travel technicians and Organizational DTAs (ODTA); and, coordinates any system issues,
including upgrades and system discrepancy reports with higher headquarters. The
Commander/Director/Designee appoints primary and alternate LDTAs and ODTAs by DD FM
577, approves signature profiles (document routing) established for the activity by letter, and
approves changes to the established profiles in the same manner. The Commander also ensures
local business rules regarding DTS are established. LGRD is provided a list of those who may
approve travel verbally with paper documentation follow up on the next business day. The list
must contain Name, Title, Office Phone and After Hours Phone. This is to support emergency
and short notice travel. The TO will provide the list to the CTO for use. Inability to contact an
approver is considered disapproval to travel.
   5.2.3. Organizational DTAs.
The Organizational DTA (ODTA) is the Traveler and Authorizing Official point of contact for
routine DTS operations.
Upon receipt of the DD FM 577, designating an individual as an ODTA, the DTA provides the
newly assigned ODTA with the correct DTS permission levels and any necessary training.
ODTAs are given permission levels necessary to allow them to modify traveler information.
ODTAs must notify the LDTA to add travelers/users. Once the LDTA adds a traveler/user the
ODTA can edit the traveler information as necessary. ODTA personnel are to subscribe to DTS
notifications on the DTS homepage (www.defensetravel.dod.mil). Provide training and technical
assistance within their hierarchy to Travelers, RO/AOs, and other DTAs as needed to ensure
smooth travel operations. Ensure all travelers complete the DTS Web Based Training and have
printed the Traveler Tri-Folds for Authorization, Voucher and Local Voucher.
   5.2.4. Finance DTA (FDTA).
The Finance DTA inputs and assigns lines of accounting for all organizations. The Finance DTA
is also responsible for coordinating with the LDTA to ensure sufficient funds are available in the
DTS Budget Module. Depending on the Commander‘s preference, the FDTA may be required to
review DTS documents. The FDTA is responsible to ensure the line of accounting (LOA) is
entered in the correct format required by the accounting system. The FDTA will ensure accurate
budget items are created.
5.3. Travel Entitlement. Simplified entitlements are the basis for the entire DTS travel
process. They reflect current policy (to include transportation, finance, budget, lodging, messing,
personnel, etc.), law, and customs; and affect virtually every aspect of the travel system. A full
understanding of simplified entitlements is required. The simplified entitlements are found in the
JFTR/JTR, Appendix O.
5.4. Travel Arrangements and Reimbursement Rate. Transportation arrangements must
follow normal point-to-point routing. The priority order of precedence in DTR 4500.9-R, Part 1,
Chapter 103 must be used. The CTO must route passengers using Patriot Express (if identified in
 60                                                            AFI24-101 19 OCTOBER 2012


the CTO PWS or local business rules) and City Pair fares, when available. The AO has authority
to reimburse expenses and approve exceptions to normal point-to-point routing based on mission
requirements, but must provide justification. The CTO must capture exceptions to policy and
report them through the STATCO reporting system. The amount of authorized reimbursement
for airfares must be calculated using the constructed cost of normal point-to-point routing using
the costs associated with the Patriot Express, City Pair, or applicable commercial fares, the same
as for travelers not using DTS.

1. Member must provide sufficient justification and approval to deviate from: the use of contract
carriers and AMC flights when available, use of a significantly higher flight cost when a lower
flight cost is available at an alternate airport serving the local area, and there is any deviation
from what is authorized for LGRD /CTO approval/authorization. One or more travel condition(s)
must apply if a non-contract carrier or a contract carrier other than the primary contractor is used
for travel within a contract route (reference JFTR, Appendix P, Part 1, Paragraph A).
2. Final determination rests with the orders-issuing authority and not the LGRD/CTO. LGRD
/CTO can best determine flight availability and cost for the order-issuing authority‘s decision.

                CENTRALLY BILLED ACCOUNT (CBA) PROCEDURES

A5.1. The CBA is used as the method of payment for airline, rail and bus tickets when:
   A5.1.1. A traveler has not been issued an Individually Billed Account (IBA), commonly
   referred to as a personal Government Travel Card (GTC).
   A5.1.2. Traveling as a group (when documented proof provided that no IBA has been
   issued).
   A5.1.3. Directed by the MAJCOM Commander/Base Commander.
A5.2. To preclude travelers from mistakenly requesting reimbursement when the CBA method
of payment is used, the CTO will mark the traveler‘s itinerary or ticket(s) with the method of
payment. Tickets purchased using a CBA will state, ―Airline ticket(s) paid by CBA, Non-
Reimbursable to Traveler.‖ Tickets purchased using an IBA will state, ―Airline Ticket(s) paid by
IBA, Reimbursable to Traveler‖.
Note: The Passenger Name Record (PNR) invoice should not contain the CBA or IBA number.
A5.3. Except for travel arrangements made through the Defense Travel System (DTS), LGRD
must maintain a copy of the PNR invoice and a copy of the travel authorization/order for each
ticket issued on the CBA. These documents should be filed either by transaction date, ticket
number or alphabetically (traveler‘s name) to facilitate reconciling the CBA invoice. If the travel
authorization/order is processed through the DTS, there is no need to retain a copy of the PNR
and travel authorization because they are stored electronically within the DTS. However,
optional retention of a copy of the PNR and travel authorization for DTS transactions,
appropriately filed, may simplify the reconciliation process.
A5.4. When un-used or partially used tickets are returned to the LGRD/CTO, documentation is
initiated and forwarded to the airline/rail company for the appropriate refund/credit. The LGRD
must establish an active suspense file identifying all travel transactions due credits/refunds from
the airlines/rail companies for tickets charged to the CBA. Tracking must be accomplished by
maintaining paper copy documentation files and by spreadsheet or another quick reference
product that provides current status of all credits/refunds due. As a minimum the tracking
product requires the travel order/authorization number, traveler‘s name, date a refund request
was submitted, amount of credit due, and the date refund/credit was received as identified on the
Government Travel Card Vendor (GTCV) invoice report. LGRD must ensure that credits due
appear on the GTCV‘s invoice report until the credit is received. A follow-up process, at least
monthly, should be established to check status of outstanding credits due.
A5.5. CBA Reconciliation Process
   A5.5.1. The GTCV forwards the paper copy of the invoice at the end of the billing cycle to
   LGRD. The paper copy GTCV invoice (bill) should be received approximately seven to ten
   days after the end of the billing cycle. When received, the invoice is date stamped. This date
   starts the clock for prompt payment. The payment due date is stated on the GTCV invoice
   (and is the date used for determining amounts past due and the account suspension date). The
   reconciliation should be completed and certified by the LGRD within 10 days after receipt.

  Note: If the paper copy invoice is not received within 10 days after the end of the billing
  cycle, LGRD should contact and advise the GTCV that the invoice was not received.
  A5.5.2. At the end of the billing cycle the GTCV sends an electronic version of the CBA
  invoice to the CTO. The electronic version should contain the same data as the paper copy
  invoice sent to LGRD. The electronic invoice should be used to start the reconciliation rather
  than waiting for the paper copy. TO's may also log on GTCV website and download the
  invoice within 5 duty days of close out date of report. TO's will start the reconciliation
  process with the downloaded copy of the invoice.
  A5.5.3. LGRD may also monitor CBA transactions using DTS CBA conditional routing..
  A5.5.4. Based on the CTO contract, the CTO‘s participation in the reconciliation process
  varies. The LGRD establishes written local procedures on the CBA reconciliation process to
  include specific CTO and LGRD responsibilities and time periods for accomplishment.
  A5.5.5. The CBA reconciliation process as a minimum must include the following:
     A5.5.5.1. Review of all charges and credits on the electronic version of the invoice to
     include: amount, date, passenger name, ticket number, and airline code. The CTO may
     make minor corrections (but not dollar amounts) and forward the updated Compact Disk
     (CD) and reports to the Transportation Officer (TO).
     A5.5.5.2. The CTO/LGRD pulls the previously filed copies of refunds identified as
     credits on the invoice for use in the reconciliation process.
     A5.5.5.3. LGRD /CTO assembles a copy of each travel authorization/order and a copy of
     each PNR invoice in the same sequence as appears on the GTCV hard copy invoice.
     A5.5.5.4. LGRD is responsible for reconciling the report for payment, making sure the
     ticket number, traveler‘s name, airline code and cost on the PNR invoice match the hard
     copy of the GTCV‘s invoice.
     A5.5.5.5. The CTO/LGRD work the unmatched transactions indicating "awaiting credit
     or wrongful charges" to the account. If there are missing credits/refunds or wrongful
     charges, the ticket number is researched for the traveler's name and date the ticket was
     issued. Ensure the appropriate GTCV dispute form is completed. LGRD must suspense
     the dispute until it is resolved with all parties concerned. Once resolved, LGRD must
     monitor the next invoice to ensure all disputes have been updated.
     A5.5.5.6. All transactions on the GTCV PAPER COPY invoice must be certified for
     payment or placed in dispute. LGRDs should reconcile and pay everything on that
     specific invoice so the charges on the invoice and the SF 1113 or SF 1034 match
     completely. The only time the price for that billing cycle should be different is when the
     LGRD disputes a charge and/or credit. When the credit shows up on the next months
     invoice, the LGRD can then process the credit, refund or void the ticket. The TO must
     verify the amount being certified for payment and type the certification statement on the
     SF 1113 or SF 1034, sign and date the form. Certifying Officials will be appointed in
     writing by the TO and submit DD Form 577 to DFAS.
     A5.5.5.7. LGRD /CTO must make the number of copies of the travel
     authorizations/orders and PNR invoices required by the supporting DFAS Field Site. The
     travel authorizations/orders and PNRs must be assembled in the proper sequence and
AFI24-101 19 OCTOBER 2012                                                                     73


       forwarded to the DFAS Field Site with a paper copy of the GTCV‘s invoice, a copy of
       the TO‘s certified SF 1113 or SF 1034 and a Compact Disk (CD) (provided by the
       CTO, or created by LGRD upon receipt of the electronic data file from the CTO.
       Each local site must verify the provisions of the DTMO/CTO contract to determine
       which method is applicable to their site) or email with all of the reconciled transactions
       in the Transportation Ticket Obligation Payment Refund System (TTOPRS) format
       (included in the DMTO Contract as one of the exhibits). Some sites do not receive a CD,
       however, the contract language should identify the CTO‘s required actions. Some sites
       receive an email from the CTO with the TTOPRS data, which must be burned to a CD
       and included in the package to DFAS.
Note: CBA transactions processed through DTS may not require copies of the travel
authorizations/ orders and PNRs to be forwarded to DFAS Field Site, as they can be reviewed
through the web. Sites/MAJCOMS must verify with the DFAS what documents are required in
the CBA reconciliation process. The Transportation Office should retain a backup copy of the
assembled documentation in case the documentation is lost in transit between the DFAS Field
Site and the shipping location.
A5.6. DFAS Field Site should process each invoice within 10 days of receipt and make EFT
payment to the bank. This effort ensures CBA payments are received by the bank in a timely
manner preventing late payment interest penalties, and precluding account suspensions.
