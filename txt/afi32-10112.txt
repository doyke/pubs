                                         GEOBASE PROGRAM

2.1. Program Overview. The GeoBase Program is implemented at each USAF installation and echelon
through a corresponding Geo Integration Office (GIO). GeoBase ensures the provision of and access to
common, accurate and current geospatial information for all Air Force installations, ranges and property.
Geospatial services are the combination of Information Technology (IT) infrastructure, services, and
architectures that enable access to geospatial information. Geospatial information, or geodata, constitutes
georeferenced imagery and vector data that represent real-world features and conditions. USAF installa-
tion geospatial information shall consist of the Common Installation Picture (CIP) and mission specific
geospatial data: Mission Data Layers (MDL), Mission Data Sets (MDS) and Regional Installation Pic-
tures (RIP). The combination of geospatial information and services to support installation and facilities’
missions forms the “GeoBase Service” and facilitates the geo-integration of information cross-function-
ally. The GeoBase Service allows cross-functional users to enable their information geospatially by link-
ing their Automated Information Systems (AIS) data to geographic locations, also known as
geo-enabling. The GeoBase Service is the system component of the GeoBase Program. The combination
of the GIO and the GeoBase Service provides commanders, planners, and personnel across the combat
support spectrum a near real time operational picture of the installation and facilities required for mission
success.
   2.1.1. Installations represent the underlying platform for the Air Force mission. Just as mission suc-
   cess in the battlespace relies on information superiority and agile combat support, installation mis-
   sions also require disciplined creation, management and sharing of critical georeferenced information
   through modern geospatial processes. The USAF GeoBase Mission satisfies this critical need across
   the installation mission spectrum.
   2.1.2. The GeoBase Program includes the people, processes, and resources used in the collection,
   analysis, dissemination and display of georeferenced information to support installation missions.
   2.1.3. GeoBase functions as a program in addition to the GeoBase Service. It focuses on information
   resource management rather than IT acquisition. IT components are necessary to attain, serve, and
   exploit capabilities, however the aim of GeoBase is to exploit existing communications network
   assets and IT resources where possible to avoid redundancies. GeoBase capabilities are served via
   existing communication networks such as the Global Combat Support System Air Force (GCSS-AF)
   and are exploited in a net-centric fashion, thereby enhancing mission systems and processes by visu-
   alizing installations and facilities across the Air Force enterprise.

2.2. GeoBase Vision. Enable decision makers with an enterprise capability for installation mapping the
visualization of fused, analyzed, and multi-functional data. Succinctly put “One Air Force, One Map.”

2.3. GeoBase Mission. Provide enterprise installation visualization services for the USAF to be shared
throughout the DoD. The mission for the program is to attain and sustain a capability enabling a shared,
efficient use of trusted, integrated, and georeferenced information delivering global situational awareness.

2.4. GeoBase Service.

    2.4.1. Provides geodata through a network of hardware and software over established USAF IT and
    communications infrastructure for simultaneous access and exploitation by any number of Headquar-
    ters (HQ) and base organizations with a requirement to visualize installations and facilities.
    2.4.2. Provides a single point of access for installation geospatial information for visualization, map-
    ping, analysis and integration into business processes of installation and facilities.
    2.4.3. May be linked with functional AIS and other IT solutions providing the ability to view func-
    tional information assets via the base map.

2.5. GeoBase Program Components. GeoBase is comprised of four unique decision support environ-
ments known as Strategic GeoBase, Garrison GeoBase, GeoReach, and Expeditionary GeoBase.
    2.5.1. Strategic GeoBase. Strategic GeoBase is comprised of all geospatial data produced in the
    USAF and aggregated at the HQ USAF (HAF) level. It offers the enhanced means to visualize Air
    Force installation data through links with other HAF level databases combined with detailed imagery
    at the HAF. The view can then be expanded by adding data from, or pushing installation data stored at
    HAF level to, the Secretary of the Air Force, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, other DoD ser-
    vices, US Northern Command, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, and other Federal agencies
    such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
    2.5.2. Garrison GeoBase. Garrison GeoBase provides the foundation for the Strategic GeoBase Pro-
    gram. Garrison GeoBase enhances the many overlapping mapping efforts across major and minor
    installations with a single, coherent approach to geospatial information stewardship, providing the
    structure for Base Operational Support. Garrison GeoBase provides the training environment for
    warfighters executing the Expeditionary GeoBase operations at Forward Operating Locations (FOL).
    2.5.3. GeoReach. GeoReach is the process to enable selection and analysis of FOL by serving
    geospatial libraries of potential forward ‘sites’ across the Air Force network. It provides planners and
    Airmen with situational awareness enabling improved FOL selection, Time-Phased Force and
    Deployment Data planning, and accelerated bed-down, in support of the Air Force Global Mobility
    Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and the Expeditionary Site Survey Process.
    2.5.4. Expeditionary GeoBase. Expeditionary GeoBase is enabled via GeoReach, and it is sustained
    using processes developed at home stations via the Garrison GeoBase Program. It is a forward
    deployed version of Garrison GeoBase capabilities, affording provisional commanders and airmen
    enhanced situational awareness of the expeditionary base.

2.6. GeoBase Data. Installation geospatial data is thematically organized within the GeoBase Service
into layers such as buildings, roads, and airfield surfaces known as MDL. MDL are further organized into
the CIP, MDS, and RIP as described in Chapter 4.

2.7. GeoBase Program Resource Management. Resource requirements for GeoBase are programmed
for using the established Program Objective Memorandum (POM) process at MAJCOMs and HAF. Geo-
Base Resources are currently programmed in PE31025F and tracked in RC/CC XXff43. Beginning with
the FY10 POM, GeoBase resources at the MAJCOMs sould be programmed using their respective Facil-
ities Operation program element (***79F).

                           GEOBASE ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE

6.1. Overview. The GeoBase Service will be supported and maintained by EA guidelines (Business
Transformation Agency, Business Enterprise Architecture, 15 March 2007, DoDD 8320.2 Data sharing
in a Net-centric Department of Defense, 2 December 2002, and DoDD 8100.1 Global Information Grid
(GIG) Overarching Policy). EA guidelines establish the road map to guide development of the GeoBase
Service. Efficient use of the EA will facilitate Air Force missions through the use of modeled business
processes paired with the efficient use of IT.

6.2. Enterprise Architecture. The GeoBase EA is documented using the DoD Architecture Framework
(DoDAF) thereby ensuring GeoBase architectures are compatible and interoperable with other USAF and
DoD information architectures. All GIOs will maintain compliance with DoDAF in accordance with the
current DoDAF publication. The use of a GeoBase EA framework ensures uniformity and standardization
when migrating and integrating information systems from legacy systems that are in place now toward a
more standardized architecture. Frameworks include concepts that drive the types of architectural prod-
ucts being created. The products, both graphical and textual, capture information on system configuration
and design. These products will enable more efficient system management.
   6.2.1. Table 6.1. shows the core architectural products. All GIOs must develop and publish the archi-
   tectural products in Table 6.1. and are encouraged to develop and publish the products shown in Table
   6.2.

6.3. EA Governance Representation. HAF GIO manages, controls, and monitors its PfM and EA activ-
ities through the Air Force Enterprise Information Technology Data Repository. GeoBase representatives
will participate in EA and PfM governing councils.

6.4. Net-Centric. All GIOs will maintain compliance with DoDD 8320.2, Data Sharing in a Net-Centric
Department of Defense, 2 December 2004, and make data available in a Net-Centric environment. Within
the limits of Information Assurance policy and appropriate data stewardship, CIP, MDL, MDS, and RIP
data will be provided via the Air Force network to the maximum extent practicable. Employ centralized
storage for their transactional data stores to improve data integrity authority, access, and system perfor-
mance. Data migrations performed to effect these consolidations will include routines to validate the data
before moving it into the new data store. The HAF GIO in cooperation with all GIOs must ensure that this
data will be timely, accurate, trusted, secure, and that the data is universally available anywhere in the Air
Force network. Once data is available in a Net-Centric environment it should be integrated, where possi-
ble, with other authoritative systems.

6.5. Vendor Neutral. The GeoBase Service includes geospatial data and associated metadata and is
served in a protected fashion using open, vendor-neutral standards as defined in the GeoBase Enterprise
Architecture.
AFI32-10112 19 OCTOBER 2007                                                                            19


6.6. Web Content. GeoBase Strategic Services will be hosted on the GCSS-AF network. These services
will be Air Force enterprise wide and will be net-centric and EA compliant.

6.7. Expeditionary Site Mapping (ESM). The CIP layers for FOLs are hosted as described in the most
recent ESM CONOPS.

6.8. Classified CIP. The Combat Air Force responsible for serving FOL CIPs on the Secret Internet Pro-
tocol Router Network as per the ESM CONOPS may also serve CIPs using similar means for access by
external (non-USAF) organizations in a classified fashion as required.

6.9. Architecture Asset. The HAF GIO maintains the GeoBase architecture with assistance from the Air
Force Chief Information Officer. The EA developed at all levels of the Air Force is a corporate asset that
will be managed as a formal program.

7.1. Security Guidelines. Data can only be classified by the Operational Control Authority (OCA) AFI
31-401, Information Security Program Management, November 2005. The OCA for the GeoBase pro-
gram is the Air Force Civil Engineer A7C. At date of publication none of the standard CE data sets have
been classified. Additionally data can only be “For Official Use Only” if it meets the exemptions of FOIA
as outlined in AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management, November 2005.
