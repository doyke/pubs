This instruction implements AFPD 10-7, Information Operations and the procedures outlined in
AFI 10-703, Electronic Warfare Integrated Reprogramming. It outlines the responsibilities,
alerting procedures, and reporting for Electronic Warfare Integrated Reprogramming (EWIR) in
the event of SERENE BYTE/PACER WARE (SB/PW) reprogramming in the 18th Wing (18
WG). Throughout this instruction, SB/PW reprogramming will frequently be referred to as
“reprogramming.” This instruction applies to all personnel assigned to the 18 WG that participate
in the reprogramming of electronic warfare systems. This publication does not apply to the Air
National Guard, US Air Force Reserve or tenant units on Kadena which have EWIR procedures
in accordance with their parent major command (MAJCOM). Refer recommended changes and
questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF
Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Form 847s from the filed
through the appropriate functional’s chain of command. Ensure that all records created as a
result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force
