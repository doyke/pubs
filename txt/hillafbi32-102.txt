Hill Air Force Base Instruction 32-102 (HILLAFBI 32-102) implements Section 3.3.2. of Air
Force Instruction (AFI) 32-7001, Environmental Management Section 3.3.2., which contains
requirements for the establishment of an installation Environmental Policy. The purpose of AFI
32-7001 is to establish the framework for an Environmental Management System (EMS) at all
levels within the Air Force (AF), including installations. AFI 32-7001 provides EMS guidance
and procedures, outlines responsibilities, and implements Department of Defense Instruction
(DoDI) 4715.17, Environmental Management System, Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 32-70,
Environmental Quality, and is consistent with AFPD 90-8, Environmental, Safety, &
Occupational Health Management and Risk Management. HillAFBI 32-102 applies to all Hill
Air Force Base (AFB) personnel. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with (IAW) Air Force Manual
(AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of IAW the Air Force Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. The list of roles and
responsibilities were removed from this instruction, as these roles and responsibilities are now
referenced in AFI 32-7001. This revision updates the scope and policy of the EMS and
supplements the recently published AFI 32-7001.

1. SCOPE. Hill AFB and all geographically separated units (GSUs), to include the Utah Test
and Training Range (UTTR), Little Mountain, Boulder Seismic Facility, and all associated
facilities, have been identified as appropriate facilities within the AF requiring implementation of
an environmental policy.
2. POLICY. The protection of the environment (air, water, land, natural resources, flora, fauna,
cultural resources, humans, and their interrelation) and sustainment of the mission must be of the
highest priority, as well as an integral element of everyday work. Hill AFB is committed to
continued excellence, leadership, and stewardship in protecting the environment.
     2.1. Hill AFB will ensure full compliance with all federal, state, local and AF environmental
     laws, regulations, and directives as we strive for continual improvement and pollution
     reduction in performance.
     2.2. Hill AFB will evaluate the compliance risk burden of existing processes and strive to
     reduce that burden through equipment, material substitutions, and process improvements.
     2.3. Hill AFB will conduct its environmental, transportation, and energy-related activities in
     support of the mission in an efficient, integrated, and fiscally sound manner; efforts will
     focus on continual improvement and the use of sustainable resources.
     2.4. The Hill AFB EMS cross-functional team (CFT) will develop, review and update
     environmental aspects, impacts, objectives and targets IAW AFI 32-7001.
