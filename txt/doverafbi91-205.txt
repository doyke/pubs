            and alternate routes; however, units must travel in authorized explosive transport
            vehicles via the most direct route between the explosives licensed facility and the
            MSA. Vehicles transporting explosives shall be utilized for the sole purpose of
            transporting explosives and shall not make ancillary stops at other facilities or
            locations. Explosives must be downloaded from vehicle and properly stored as
            soon as possible.
        9.1.4.2. Off-base explosive routes.
            9.1.4.2.1. Units with a requirement to perform explosive movements to off-base
            locations for operational or training requirements must adhere to both DoD and
            DoT regulations and local state and jurisdictional law. ADWSRs must ensure
            personnel who transport explosives to off-base locations are trained and certified
            IAW 49 CFR, the Defense Transportation Regulation, AFI 24-301 and para.
            9.1.2.5 of this instruction. Individuals traveling off-base with explosives should:

                 necessary for the mission.
                 9.1.4.2.1.2. Know the most direct route between locations and make every
                 attempt to utilize less populated areas, road and weather conditions, and force
                 protection conditions.
                 9.1.4.2.1.3. Have an adequate means of communication along with base and
                 local emergency response contact numbers.
                 9.1.4.2.1.4. Meet minimal standards for arming commensurate with mission,
                 type munitions, and force protection conditions.
                 9.1.4.2.1.5. Notify base fire department and security forces desk prior to
                 departure and upon arrival at both locations. Provide the fire department with
                 HD and net explosive weight (NEW) of explosives being transported.
                 9.1.4.2.1.6. Do not stop at off-base locations for other than emergencies.
                 9.1.4.2.1.7. Ensure explosive compatibility requirements are met.
10. The absence of a specific safety or procedural requirement in this instruction does not
indicate that such a requirement is unnecessary.

       BLANK AMMUNITION/PYROTECHNIC SAMPLE ILLUSTRATIONS

A7.1. BLANK AMMUNITION, 5.56mm and 7.62mm
  A7.1.1. DESCRIPTION. (See Fig. A7.1) Blank ammunition is nothing more than standard
  ammunition minus a projectile. The casing is slightly longer than a normal casing to allow
  for the restriction and sealing of the powder. This allows the powder to explode, rather than
  burn slowly when the primer is struck. The end of the 5.56mm casing is crimped and sealed
  while the 7.62mm casing is plugged and sealed with wax.
  A7.1.2. FUNCTION. Blank ammunition is chambered in a weapon in the same manner as
  standard ammunition. When the weapon’s firing pin strikes the primer of a blank round, the
  primer ignites the blank’s powder charge which in turn, burns very rapidly. The gases
  caused by this ignition escape from the end of the blank casing with explosive force. These
  gases are restricted from exiting the weapon’s barrel by a blank adapter. The result of this
  restriction is back pressure which allows the weapon to function, ejecting the spent blank
  casing and chambering a fresh one.
  A7.1.3. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS. In addition to the precautions listed in paragraph 7 of
  this Instruction, the following safety precautions apply:
     A7.1.3.1. WARNING: The blank adapter disperses the majority of the blast from the
     blank ammunition however, this blast can still cause death or injury to personnel if they
     are too close to the muzzle of the weapon. 5.56mm (M-16, GAU-5) blank ammunition
     will not be fired directly at personnel who are closer than 25 feet to the weapon. 7.62mm
     (M60, M14) blank ammunition will not be fired directly at personnel who are closer than
     45 feet to the weapon.
     A7.1.3.2. WARNING: Ensure the blank adapter is secure. A loose blank adapter can
     act as a projectile.
     A7.1.3.3. Standard weapon safety procedures will be observed at all times.
     A7.1.3.4. Blank ammunition will not be fired from any weapon that does not have a
     blank adapter installed.
  A7.1.4. OPERATING PROCEDURES.
     A7.1.4.1. WARNING: Ensure that only blank ammunition is carried. Firing live
     ammunition through a weapon with a blank adapter installed will have catastrophic
     results.
     A7.1.4.2. Weapons are operated in the same manner, with the same precautions as when
     firing live ammunition.
     A7.1.4.3. If a weapon malfunction occurs, clear the malfunction as if live ammunition is
     being used.
     A7.1.4.4. Blank ammunition that has been damaged or unsuccessfully fired will be
     placed in a sealed ammunition can and given to EOD upon termination of the operation
     or training exercise.

      A7.1.4.5. Following the exercise, the training area will be policed for ammunition
      residue.
      A7.1.4.6. CAUTION: Blank ammunition casings left on roadways can cause severe tire
      damage.

A7.2. SMOKE GRENADE, M18
   A7.2.1. DESCRIPTION. (See Fig. 1) The smoke grenade consists of a cylindrical metal
   body that contains various smoke color mixtures (thermite filler), a fuse assembly, and a
   smoke emission hole. The fuse assembly is threaded and is screwed into the grenade body.
   The Fuse consists of a primer, a spring-loaded striker or firing pin, a delay fuse, a safety lever
   (commonly referred to as a ―spoon‖), and a safety pin. The smoke emission hole is covered
   with pressure sensitive tape and is located at the base of the grenade body, opposite the fuse.
   The smoke grenade is used to mark locations, disguise movement, and for signaling. NOTE:
   Smoke grenades are individually packaged in dense cardboard/fiber cylinders. These
   cylinders are separated in the center and are sealed with tape.
   A7.2.2. FUNCTION. When the safety pin is removed, the safety lever which covers the
   spring-loaded striker is released. The striker fires the primer which lights the delay fuse.
   The fuse burns for approximately 1.2 to 2 seconds before igniting the starter mixture and
DOVERAFBI91-205 18 MAY 2012                                                                  31


  smoke filler. As the filler burns, smoke is released through the smoke emission hole. The
  grenade will continue burning for approximately 40 seconds.
  A7.2.3. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS. In addition to the precautions listed in paragraph 7. of
  this Instruction, the following safety precautions apply:
