     equivalent.
     2.2. Exercises administrative control (ADCON) and operational control (OPCON) over
     assigned MXS personnel.

        3.1.1. Execute commanders responsibilities as outlined in AFI 1-2, Commanders

        components; perform on-equipment maintenance of aircraft and fabrication of parts.
        Additionally, conduct periodic/calendar inspections on aircraft or equipment. May

        accessories, AGE, fabrication, armament, maintenance, and munitions flights.
        3.2.2. Refer to AFRCMD1113, Maintenance Group, and AFRCMD1114, Aircraft

12304b), combatant command authority (COCOM) transfers to the combatant commander to

operational chain of command established by that commander.
