     1.4.5.1. OG/CC (or equivalent) will convene a Training Review Panel (TRP) to be
     chaired by the     OG/CC or designated representative. Panel members should include
     representatives from group training, squadron training, tactics, operations, safety and
     other areas as determined by the commander, i.e. Aircrew Training System (ATS)
     contractors, Host Aviation Resource Management (HARM) and Squadron Aviation
     Resource Management (SARM).
         1.4.5.1.1. TRP Requirements. Convene the TRP once per semi-annual calendar
         period and maintain minutes for a period of two years (commanders may increase this
         frequency as required). Squadrons and detachments not collocated with their OG may
         conduct their own panel or provide representation to their OG TRP. Panel minutes
         from non-collocated squadron and detachment TRPs will be forwarded to their OG
         training office for inclusion in their OG TRP.
         1.4.5.1.2. TRP Format. The TRP should review staff and crewmember management
         actions necessary to complete squadron flight and ground training programs.

         Training Levels, (FTL), upgrade and Continuation Training (CT) status, Semi-annual
         requirement completion rates, crew position gains/losses, Aircraft Commander (AC),
         FI and FE upgrades. Units should also review all unit defined training “X” events for
         relevancy.
     1.4.5.2. OG/CC may develop additional training requirements and/or programs as
     necessary to meet unit mission requirements. Units may include such requirements in
     local training guidance.
     1.4.5.3. OG/CC is responsible for establishing and maintaining academic training
     programs including non-ATS courses (may be delegated to squadron level). The OG (or
     squadron) OPR will:
         1.4.5.3.1. Appoint a primary and alternate instructor for each non-ATS course.
         1.4.5.3.2. Publish a ground training schedule (ANG/AFRC, as required) to include
         date, time, location, and instructor for each course. Units may include such details in
         local training guidance.

         content, currency of materials, instructor availability, and status of training aids.
         Squadron should recommend to the commander changes to existing courses or
         additional academic training courses required, based on crewmember feedback.
  1.4.6. Squadrons. SQ/CC (or designated representative) will:
     1.4.6.1. Select training chiefs from the most highly qualified and experienced instructors.
     Previous examiner or FTU experience is highly desired. Ensure Sq Training is manned
     with a minimum of one instructor for each crew position. FIs should be selected based on
     experience, availability, and time on station (to ensure continuity of operations for each
     crew position in Training).
     1.4.6.2. Before each semi-annual training period, assign FTL to assigned and attached
     crewmembers (see Chapter 4).
     1.4.6.3. Ensure formal school post-graduate questionnaires are completed.
     1.4.6.4. Convene a Squadron Training Review Panel (STRP) to be chaired by the SQ/CC
     and/or Sq/Director of Operations (DO). Panel members should include representatives
     from training, Standards and Evaluations (Stan/Eval), Assistant DOs (ADO), and the
     chief from each crew position. Sq/CCs should utilize the STRP to focus training
     objectives, ensure standards are being met, select upgrade candidates, and ensure
     completion of required continuation training.
         1.4.6.4.1. STRP Requirements. Squadrons will convene a STRP monthly (quarterly
         for AFRC and ANG) and maintain minutes for a period of two years. STRP minutes
         will be approved by the SQ/CC (or Sq/DO) and may be produced/distributed/stored
         electronically by the Sq Aircrew Training.
         1.4.6.4.2. STRP Format.         The STRP should review staff and crewmember
         management actions necessary to complete squadron flight and ground training
         programs. The STRP will review the current status of aircrew training to ensure that
         current training objectives are being met and that those individuals selected for
         upgrade training are the best candidates after reviewing their experience, proficiency
         level, and retainability. To accomplish these goals, suggested STRP topics include but
         are not limited to: crew position gains/losses, current upgrade/requalification training
         (i.e. crewmembers in an active training status), recently completed training (including
         performance during training and current certification status), future training
         (individuals already approved via STRP), upgrade candidates, current waivers,
         projected waivers, and continuation training status.
     1.4.6.5. Ensure adequate training continuity and supervision of assigned and attached
     crewmembers. Unit commanders may assign additional requirements based on individual
     crewmember’s experience and proficiency.
     1.4.6.6. Review training and evaluation records of newly assigned or attached
     crewmembers and those completing formal training, to determine the necessary training
AFI11-2AEV1_452AMWSUP 2 APRIL 2014                                                          11

  1.4.7. Chief Nurse. The CN appoints AE equipment trainers in writing. AE equipment
  trainers are not required to be FIs; however, they must be a qualified AECM. The CN must
  ensure trainers complete the trainer requirements listed in AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training
  Program, On the Job Training Administration. Equipment trainer selection process should
  be defined in local training guidance.
     1.4.7.1. (Added-452AMW) The Chief Flight Nurse (CN) will appoint equipment
     trainers on an as-needed basis. Equipment trainer candidates are proposed by the officer
     in charge of clinical training and approved by the 452 AES Training Flight (AET), the
     CN and the superintendent of nursing services. Equipment trainers are selected based on
     their knowledge of the equipment and the ability to train/teach one-on-one or in a group
     setting. Selected equipment trainers will complete all requirements IAW AFI 36-2201,
     Ch. 6, Air Force On-The-Job Training Administration. Upon successful completion of
     training, the CN generates an equipment trainer appointment letter and files copies in the
     master appointment letter binder and the nursing services continuity binder. The 452
     AES/AET will update the Letter of Xs and file a copy with clinical training.

1.6. Use of Flying Hours.
   1.6.1. Structure unit flying training missions to achieve optimum training. Any by-product
   airlift opportunity resulting from training must not degrade the intended training in any way
   and will comply with applicable Department of Defense (DOD) Regulation 4515.13-R, Air
   Transportation Eligibility, AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and AFI 11-202v1.
       1.6.1.1. It is essential that all personnel at all levels prevent the misuse of air mobility
       resources as well as the perception of their misuse.
   1.6.2. Training on Operational Missions. Unless specifically prohibited or restricted by
   weapon system operating procedures or specific theater operations order (OPORD), the
   OG/CC exercising operational control may approve upgrade, qualification, or recurrency
   training on operational missions. In order to maximize efficient utilization of training
   resources, AE units will identify and take maximum advantage of opportunities to conduct
   appropriate continuation training items which may be conveniently suited to concurrent
   operational mission segments. Commanders will ensure that the training will not impact
   mission effectiveness or degrade level of care, and the crewmember receiving training is
   under the supervision of an instructor of like specialty. Comply with passenger-carrying
   restrictions found in AFI 11-202v3, General Flight Rules.
1.7. In-Unit Training Time Limitations. Crewmembers entered into in-unit training will
complete final training events within time limitations listed in Table 1.2. Final training events
are listed in A2.1.9
   1.7.1. Crewmembers entered in an in-unit training program will be dedicated to that program
   on a full-time basis. When conducting in-unit qualification training, the commander will
   relieve students of duties not directly related to training.
   1.7.2. In-unit qualification training will begin no later than 45 days (90 days AFRC/ANG)
   following successful completion of formal school requirements (FN/AET course and SERE
   courses) and reporting or attaching to a new duty station or unit. MAJCOM/A3T is the
   waiver authority for training not started within 45 days (90 days AFRC/ANG) and will be
   requested before the crewmember exceeds the 45 days (90 days AFRC/ANG) start date.

                                           Chapter 4

                               CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. Description. This chapter establishes the minimum flying and related ground training
requirements to maintain an assigned aircrew currency. The unit commander will ensure each
crewmember receives sufficient continuation training to maintain individual proficiency.
4.2. Aircrew Status. Squadron commanders will assign AE crewmembers an aircrew status
using the following criteria:
   4.2.1. Mission Ready (MR). For Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS),
   operational tasking, and deployments, a MR crewmember is defined as one who is available,
   current and qualified (completed initial and mission qualification training for the applicable
   crew position).
   4.2.2. Non-Mission Ready (NMR). A crewmember that is unqualified, non-current or
   incomplete in required continuation training. See paragraph 4.9 for specific guidance on
   crewmembers who are non-current or incomplete in required continuation training.
   4.2.3. Basic Mission Capable (BMC). Does not apply to AE personnel.
   4.2.4. Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ). A crewmember that has satisfactorily completed
   initial or requalification training in any universal designated MDS and is qualified to perform
   aircrew duties. Crewmember has not completed requirements to achieve MR status.
   4.2.5. MR and BAQ crewmembers must accomplish and/or maintain the requirements in
   AFI 11-202v1 (for their respective status) and the appropriate events in the ground and semi-
   annual flying continuation tables in this chapter.
4.3. Training Levels.
   4.3.1. The SQ/CC will assign FTLs to assigned and attached crewmembers before each
   semi-annual period. Assign new unit crewmembers a FTL during in-processing. Base FTL
   on experience and aircraft proficiency.
      4.3.1.1. NMR crewmembers assigned to MAJCOM Headquarters, Air Operations
      Centers (AOCs), Numbered Air Force (NAF), USAF Expeditionary Center (USAFEC),
      Contingency Response Group (CRG), Air Mobility Operations Group (AMOG) and
      USAFSAM are categorized as FTL E.
   4.3.2. Flying Training Levels (FTL).
      4.3.2.1. FTL “A”– Highly Experienced Crewmembers. This may include MR HQ AF,
      MAJCOM, AOCs and NAF personnel; formal schoolhouse instructors; USAF
      Expeditionary Center instructors; WG/CC, OG/CC, and Sq/CC; operations officers,
      personnel assigned to OG examiner positions; and FIs/FEs assigned primarily to staff
      duties. Sq/CC’s have the discretion to assign highly experienced MR unit crewmembers
      to this level.
      4.3.2.2. FTL “B”– Experienced, MR Crewmember.
      4.3.2.3. FTL “C”– MR Crewmember.
AFI11-2AEV1_452AMWSUP 2 APRIL 2014                                                             27


      4.3.2.4. FTL “D”– BAQ Crewmember. Primarily for individuals pursuing MR status
      after qualification training.
      4.3.2.5. FTL “E”— BAQ non-instructor staff in initial or requalification training (if
      applicable). May include senior officers, MAJCOM, NAF, AMOS and TACC staff who
      are not maintaining MR or FI status. FTL E requirements are insufficient for MR status,
      and crewmembers assigned to this FTL will fly with a FI of like specialty at all times.
   4.3.3. Changes of FTL
      4.3.3.1. Once the semi-annual period begins, do not move a MR crewmember to a level
      requiring fewer events except upon completion of FI upgrade. Prorate events at the end of
      the training periods.
4.4. Training Events/Tables. Standardized ARMS training event identifiers and descriptions
are in Chapter 7. The unit may designate Unit Defined Events (UDE) as “X” event (i.e. X020)
and will include local X event identifiers in OG/CC level guidance. (see paragraph 7.26)
   4.4.1. Crediting Event Accomplishment. Credit required events accomplished on an ARM,
   OTM and STM missions. Those flight events accomplished on a satisfactory
   qualification/mission or requalification evaluation may be credited towards the individual’s
   currency requirements and establishes a subsequent due date.
   4.4.2. For an unsatisfactory flight evaluation. Do not log continuation training requirements
   for those events graded Q-3 until requalified.
   4.4.3. Crewmembers performing extended alert duty (more than 72-hours) may accomplish
   ground training that does not degrade required response time or mission accomplishment.
   Specify requirements and/or restriction in MAJCOM supplement.
4.5. Continuation Training Requirements.
   4.5.1. Completion and tracking of continuation training is the responsibility of the individual
   crewmember. Crewmembers shall actively work with unit schedulers and training offices to
   ensure their continuation training is accomplished as described in this chapter.
   4.5.2. Ground Training Events. Crewmembers will comply with requirements of Table 4.1
   and 4.2 See Chapter 7 for event descriptions.
      4.5.2.1. Failure to accomplish ground continuation training events in Table 4.1 and
      Table 4.2 leads to grounded or NMR status. See paragraph 4.9 for exceptions and for
      regaining MR status.
      4.5.2.2. Failure to complete mobility training in Table 4.3 does not lead to NMR status,
      but may restrict member from certain missions.
      4.5.2.3. Failure to complete semi-annual continuation flying requirements listed in Table
      4.4 and 4.5 leads to NMR status. See paragraph 4.9. for exceptions and for regaining MR
      status.
      4.5.2.4. Crewmembers attached to units (i.e. MAJCOM, NAF (AFRC), USAF
      Expeditionary Center, etc.) may accomplish ground training events at locations other than
      their unit of attachment. The crewmember is responsible for reporting accomplished
      training events to their unit of attachment (ARMS office).

       4.5.2.5. All training events will be recorded in ARMS. Input all one-time events and
       events required for Permanent Change-of-Station (PCS) in the ARMS database.
       4.5.2.6. Aircraft Training (CBT/IBT) – will be completed for continuation per Table 4.1
       and Table 4.2 CBT/IBTs will be completed on a 17 month cycle to refresh aircraft
       specific training. AECMs may choose to align completion of the CBT/IBTs in
       preparation for their open-book requisite test.
   4.5.3. Flying Continuation Training Requirements.
       4.5.3.1. As a minimum, senior officer AECMs will maintain FTL D. Senior officers on
       MR status will comply with Table 4.4.

   4.5.4. Flying Continuation Training Requirements. Flight training requirements from Table
   4.4 and Table 4.5 can be accomplished on training missions, operational missions (IAW
   paragraph 1.6.2) or STMs on a static aircraft or ATD. Reference AMC/A3T ARM Training
   guide on the A3TM AE CoP for pre-mission requirements for appropriate contents of a
   mission folder required for training. EXCEPTION: F900 cannot be credited on a STM.
32                                             AFI11-2AEV1_452AMWSUP 2 APRIL 2014


     4.5.4.1. Aircrew Ratio (ACR) and Aircrew Composition. On a scheduled OTM, ARM,
     or STM, a crew complement of two FNs and three AETs is required. A MCC is also
     required for any mission where training is performed, to facilitate the execution of
     scenarios, provide instructional guidance on medical interventions, aircraft emergencies
     and document observations of crewmember performance.
     4.5.4.2. AE Equipment. An AE crew scheduled to fly an OTM, ARM, CETM or STM
     are required to carry operational AE In-Flight Kits and PMI Equipment IAW AFI 11-
     2AEv3 Table 4.1. NOTE: For local training missions, controlled medications are
     optional at the discretion of the CN.
     4.5.4.3. AE Mission Training. The minimum training standard for an ARM, OTM or
     STM will include one enplaning or one deplaning session with three occupied or
     weighted litters (may be mannequins or live simulated patients), coupled with training
     scenarios that meet the unit’s required training objectives. Consult AMC/A3T
     Aeromedical Readiness Mission (ARM) Training Guide for additional guidance.
     EXCEPTION: OTMs are exempt from litter requirements.
  4.5.5. Operational Training Mission. A scheduled operational mission leg on which no
  patients have been manifested for airlift. AECMs may utilize up to four hours to complete
  continuation training requirements from Table 4.4 and Table 4.5. EXCEPTION: Prior to
  conducting training on an operational mission, one AECM will assume a patient role and one
  MCC trained AECM will assume the MCC role; thereby decreasing the crew complement for
  training to one FN and two AETs. NOTE: If a MCC trained AECM is not available, training
  is not authorized.
  4.5.6. Aeromedical Readiness Mission. Aeromedical readiness missions are designed to
  provide training in aircraft operations, in-flight medical care and application of medical
  equipment to simulated patients to prepare AECMs for the movement of casualties.
     4.5.6.1. ARMs will be scheduled for sufficient flight time to provide for quality training.
     If maintenance or weather precludes the completion of training, credit may be granted for
     the training events accomplished.
     4.5.6.2. An ARM scheduled to fly for longer durations should be divided into multiple
     segments to maximize use of flying hours to complete continuation training events for all
     AECMs participating in the mission.
     4.5.6.3. Tandem Training Missions (TTM). AECMs on an ARM are authorized to
     conduct simultaneous (tandem) training on the same aircraft utilizing no more than two
     basic AE crews to meet flight currency requirements. AECMs in primary crew positions
     will log primary time when performing in-flight duties. Example: Two basic AE crews
     conducting separate in-flight training using separate in-flight kits, medical equipment,
     mission documentation and led by (2) separate MCCs. Training of tandem crews will be
     noted on AFTO 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document. A lead crew will be
     identified to the flight crew prior to take off for CRM purposes. (Ref AFI 11-401).
     4.5.6.4. ARM missions will only be conducted on C-17, C-130, and KC-135 airframes.
     4.5.6.5. ARM Training Exception. Within 24 hours prior to conducting training on a
     scheduled ARM, if less than the basic crew complement and MCC are available, the
AFI11-2AEV1_452AMWSUP 2 APRIL 2014                                                           33


       basic crew complement may be modified by the Sq/DO to avoid mission cancellation.
       Minimum crew complement is one FN and two AETs with a trained MCC. This
       exception is based on last minute changes to an ARM scheduled with a basic crew
       complement and MCC. If a MCC trained AECM is not available or the minimum crew
       complement cannot be filled, the ARM will be cancelled. The AE Unit Scheduler or
       designated representative will notify the OG/CC or designated representative of the
       exception to crew complement. Notify MAJCOM of the exception within 48 hours IAW
       MAJCOM policy. Document crew changes in remarks section of AFTO 781. NOTE:
       ARM Training Exception does not apply for scheduled Tandem Training Missions.
   4.5.7. Static Training Mission. STM may be accomplished in a static aircraft or ATDs to
   complete continuation flying training events when a flight has been cancelled or the aircraft
   is unavailable for flight.
   4.5.8. Contingency Exercise Training Mission (CETM). A training mission conducted
   during a Wing or MAJCOM sponsored exercise (e.g. JRTC, AECOT, RODEO or IG
   Inspections). Crew complement will be IAW AFI 11-2AEv3 and based on scenario
   requirements. All crewmembers will be current and qualified. Upgrade training/evaluations
   on CETMs must be approved by the exercise owning MAJCOM/A3T. A trained MCC is not
   required for the mission. AECMs may also take credit for specific events identified in
   Tables 4.4 and 4.5 A CETM mission has no required flight time.

4.7. Ancillary Training. Ancillary Training is guidance or instruction that contributes to
mission accomplishment, but is separate from an Air Force Specialty or occupational series. AFI
11-2AEv1 is not the governing directive for completion of ancillary training events. IAW AFI
11-202v1, the source AFI provides training frequency for these events unless an approved waiver
has been authorized. See Unit Deployment Manager representative to ensure compliance with
additional USAF personnel training requirements.
4.8. Proration of Training. AFI 11-202v1 describes proration of training requirements for
crewmembers not available for flying duties. In addition, prorate training for non-availability
due to contingency alerts and contingency flying TDYs when the contingency precludes training
for certain mission events. This authority must be used judiciously, especially when prorating
the same crewmember for consecutive semi-annual training periods.
   4.8.1. Use this formula to determine training requirements at the end of the training cycle:
   number of months available times the event volume divided by the number of months in the
   training period. Round down to the nearest whole number, but not less than 1 (e.g., FTL C
   AET in need of M221 was available 136 days. Take 5 (months available per Table 4.6) X 2
   (events in semi-annual period) divided by 6 (months in semi-annual period) = 1.6. Round
   down to nearest whole number, but not less than 1. Prorated requirement for M221= 1).
         4.8.1.1. Use Table 4.6 to determine the number of months available. Prorate only if
         absence is at least 15 consecutive days.
         4.8.1.2. When an individual permanently changes station to a unit flying the same model
         aircraft and enters the same training level or lower, during the training cycle, credit
         training accomplished at the previous base. Prorate training requirements based on the
         time available (e.g. time at former base, plus time at new base, minus number of days not
         available) during the training period. Time available starts seven days after sign-in for
         CONUS and 14 days after sign-in for OCONUS or on the date of actual accomplishment
         of the first training event, whichever occurs first. Subtract previous accomplishments
         from the prorated total to determine remaining requirements.
   4.8.2. Units may also prorate requirements for individuals changing training levels. Units
   may elect to credit past accomplishments, but if they elect to do so they may not prorate new
   training requirements. Individuals moving from Level A to Level B must complete any new
   training currencies required in Level B. Individuals moving from Level C to Level A or B
   must re-qualify in the events they are not qualified in and complete mission qualification
   requirements.

Table 4.6. Individual Availability.

4.9. Failure to Complete Training Requirements. Place individuals on supervised status and
declare them NMR in SORTS if they fail to maintain flying currency, fail to complete semi-
annual flying continuation training or ground training requirements. The following guidance
applies:
   4.9.1. Flight Training Currency. Flight currency is associated with those events denoted in
   the flying continuation training tables by a specific period of time (monthly, quarterly, semi-
   annual, or annually) within which an event must be accomplished. A currency event must be
   accomplished at least once within that specified time in order to maintain the currency.
       4.9.1.1. Loss of Currency. Place individuals delinquent in one or more events in
       supervised training status and declare them NMR until the flying event is completed or
       waived. Loss of MR status prohibits an individual from accomplishing unsupervised in-
       flight duties. Crewmembers are non-current the day after event currency expires (i.e., a
       crewmember with a 60-day requirement accomplished F900 on 1 September, becomes
       non-current on the 61st day, 1 November). EXCEPTION: MAJCOM/A3 retains waiver
       authority for F900, Mission Management Sortie IAW AFI 11-202v1.
       4.9.1.2. Regaining Currency.
          4.9.1.2.1. For loss of currency up to six months. Crewmember must demonstrate
          proficiency on any aircraft they are qualified on. The crewmember must be in a
          designated crew position supervised by a FI of like specialty for all delinquent items
          and as a minimum, will demonstrate or verbalize aircraft emergency equipment and
          exit, review the In-flight Medical Kit and emergency functions of the medical
          equipment.
          4.9.1.2.2. Loss of currency exceeding six months. Crewmember is declared
          unqualified and must complete SQ/CC directed requalification training (paragraph
          2.5) and receive an aircrew flight evaluation IAW AFI 11-2AEv2.
   4.9.2. Failure to Complete Semi-annual Flying Training Events. Individuals who fail to
   complete semi-annual flying training requirements (Table 4.4 and Table 4.5.) are declared
   NMR and prohibited from unsupervised in-flight duties, flying outside of the CONUS or
   deployment until the required training is completed or waived.
       4.9.2.1. The SQ/CC will review ARMS products at the end of each semi-annual training
       period. For individuals who fail to accomplish training requirements, the SQ/CC will
       either declare them NMR or request an OG/CC waiver for the requirement (paragraph
       1.5.7).
       4.9.2.2. If OG/CC waiver is not accomplished, place crewmembers who are NMR for
       failure to complete semi-annual flying training events in supervised status until the
       required training is accomplished.
       4.9.2.3. OCONUS MAJCOMs may allow individuals to fly local, routine, and non-
       contingency missions in their respective theater as specified in MAJCOM supplement.
       4.9.2.4. Training (ground or flying) is creditable towards the new training period.

   4.9.3. Ground Training Events.
      4.9.3.1. Failure to complete. Individuals who fail to complete ground training
      requirements (Table 4.1 and Table 4.2) are declared NMR. The crewmember cannot
      deploy until training is accomplished.
   4.9.4. Mobility Training.
      4.9.4.1. Failure to complete Mobility Training events in Table 4.3 does not affect MR
      status but restricts crewmembers from performing missions that require the delinquent
      event(s) until the training is accomplished.
   4.9.5. Waivers for Continuation Training Events. The OG/CC or equivalent may waive
   continuation training events identified in Table 4.1, Table 4.2, Table 4.4 and Table 4.5
   IAW 1.5.5 The decision to grant a waiver will be based on the individual crewmember’s
   experience and proficiency level (i.e. waivers will not be based on a crewmember’s
   availability). OG/CC will determine the allowable time period of the waiver. The make-up
   training should be accomplished at the earliest opportunity. This waiver is for unforeseen
   circumstances only and only for events that will not degrade mission accomplishment.
4.10. Requirements Before PCS or TDY by Rated Members on Active Flying Status. AFI
11-202v1 specifies requirements before PCS or TDY.
4.11. Requirements Before Removal From Active Flying. AFI 11-202v1 specifies
requirements before removal from active flying.
4.12. Requirements While In Inactive Flying Status. AFI 11-202v1 specifies requirements
while in inactive flying status.
4.13. Requirements for MAJCOM/NAF Stan/Eval or Aircrew Training AECMs. AECMs
assigned to MAJCOM/NAF Stan/Eval or Aircrew Training Directorates will attach to an AE
squadron of choice and maintain mission ready status.
4.14. Aircrew Flying With Other Than US Air Force Units. AFI 11-202v1 addresses
individuals flying in this status.
4.15. Training Period. Continuation training program is based on six month (semi-annual)
periods (1 January – 30 June; 1 July – 31 December).

  AEROMEDICAL EVACUATION CREWMEMBER QUICK RESPONSE TRAINING
                          PROGRAM

6.1. Description. The aircraft Quick Response Training (QRT) program is designed for the
current and qualified AECM to receive one-time temporary training to perform in-flight aircrew
duties on aircraft they are not qualified on prior to performing an operational AE mission on an
opportune aircraft. Opportune AE platforms are aircraft other than the C-130, C-17, KC-135 or
C-21 (as applicable). Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) will be included as an opportune AE
Platform.
6.2. Scope. This chapter outlines the requirements for QRT to respond to and perform AE
missions in a time critical manner. It is imperative that any available aircraft be considered to
transport a patient to save life, limb, or eyesight. This program applies to all AECMs regardless
of command of assignment.
6.3. Guidelines. QRT allows AECMs to safely airlift urgent or priority patients.
   6.3.1. If an AECM is required to fly an opportune operational AE mission in a primary crew
   position, F900 (Mission Management Currency Sortie) requirements can be fulfilled.

Terms
Academic Training— A course of instruction that includes, but is not limited to, classroom
instruction related to aircraft systems and operation, flight characteristics and techniques,
performance, normal procedures, abnormal procedures, and emergency procedures. To
adequately prepare students, academic courses should be completed prior to simulator or flight
training.
AFI11-2AEV1_452AMWSUP 2 APRIL 2014                                                            81


Aeromedical Evacuation (AE)— The rapid evacuation of patients during contingencies is
necessary to prevent undue suffering and preserve military strength. AE provides time-sensitive
en route care of regulated casualties to and between medical treatment facilities using organic
and/or contracted aircraft with medical aircrew trained explicitly for the mission. AE forces can
operate as far forward as aircraft are able to conduct air operations, across the full range of
military operations, and in all operating environments. Specialty medical teams may be assigned
to work with the AE aircrew to support patients requiring more intensive en route care.
Aeromedical Evacuation Crew Member (AECM)— Qualified FNs, AETs, and unqualified
student trainees performing AE duties under the direct supervision of a qualified FI or FE.
Aeromedical Evacuation Technician (AET)— An enlisted medical corps technician who has
completed a recognized course of study in aerospace nursing and has current aeronautical orders
in that Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC). See AFI 11-401 for Flight Authorization Duty Code.
Aeromedical Readiness Mission (ARM)— Training missions using simulated patients to
prepare AECMs for care and evacuation of patients during wartime.
Aircraft Commander (AC)— Pilot who has been certified to perform “pilot-in-command”
duties.
Aircraft Static— Stationary aircraft used for training purposes, must be one of the aircraft used
for AE Universal Qualification and have power to the aircraft.
Aircrew Training Device (ATD)—All aircraft trainers (aircraft, FuT, or CCT), computer
assisted instruction, sound-on-slide programs, videos, and mockups designed to prepare students
for flight training or augment prescribed continuation training.
Annual (A)— Training required once every calendar year.
Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ)— Aircrew member who has successfully completed an in-
flight evaluation but is not mission ready.
Biennial (B)— Training required once every two calendar years.
Cargo Compartment Trainer (CCT)— Commercially fabricated device that provides actual
environment in which crewmembers learn, develop, improve, and integrate skills associated with
their crew position. The CCT is a mockup of a real aircraft, not to be confused with a FuT which
is a real aircraft with the wings removed. The interior of the CCT allows crewmembers to
configure the space for floor loading or the use of stanchions and hookups for medical equipment
for static training.
Charge Aeromedical Evacuation Technician (CMT)— A qualified AET who supervises other
AETs in aircrew positions on an AE mission.
Contingency Exercise Training Mission (CETM)— A training mission conducted during a
DOD/MAJCOM/Wing sponsored exercise, Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC),
Aeromedical Evacuation Contingency Operation Training (AECOT), or Inspector General (IG)
inspection. Crew complement will be IAW AFI 11-2AEv3 and based on scenario requirements.
All crewmembers will be current and qualified. Upgrade training/evaluations are prohibited on
CETM flights. A trained MCC is not required for this mission. AECMs can only take credit for
specific events listed in 4.3. A CETM mission has no required flight time.
 82                                              AFI11-2AEV1_452AMWSUP 2 APRIL 2014


Computer—Based Training (CBT)— Ground training system that uses computer-generated
graphics or text in conjunction with interactive programs as the primary medium of instruction.
Continuation Training— Ground and flight training events necessary to maintain mission-
ready or basic qualification status.
Currency Event— Flying continuation training events with prescribed maximum interval
between accomplishments shown in the “CUR” column.
Currency Reference Month— Month used to calculate due dates for training events.
Event— A training requirement/event in this AFI. Several events or tasks constitute a training
profile.
Flight Examiner (FE)— A crewmember certified to administer evaluations.
Flight Instructor (FI)— Crewmember trained, qualified, and certified by the SQ/CC as an
instructor.
Flight Nurse (FN)— A nurse corps officer who has completed a recognized course of study in
aerospace nursing and has current aeronautical orders in that AFSC. See AFI 11-401 for Flight
Authorization Duty Code.
Flying Training Level (FTL)— A standard assigned to crewmembers, based upon experience
and Sq/ CC recommendation, directing flying continuation training requirements.
Fuselage Trainer (FuT)—An actual aircraft that has the wings removed and pneumatic devices
such as the loading ramp and the electrical plugs are operated by household electricity and/or
external power. This device provides an actual environment in which crewmembers learn,
develop, improve, and integrate skills associated with their crew position. The interior of the FuT
allows crewmembers to configure the space for floor loading or the use of stanchions and
hookups for medical equipment for static training.
Instructor Based Training—Required MDS specific training accomplished by an instructor
following a standardized plan of instruction.
Instructor Supervision— A qualified instructor of like specialty supervising a maneuver or
event.
Medical Crew Director (MCD)— A qualified FN who supervises patients, manages AECMs,
and has overall medical and patient responsibility during AE.
Mission Clinical Coordinator (MCC)— A qualified AECM trained to complete training duties
specified in the AMC ARM Training Program Guide. FIs and FEs may also fill this role.
Mission Ready (MR)— An aircrew member who is current and qualified IAW AFI 11-2AEv1.
Monthly— Training required once every calendar month.
Non-Mission Ready (NMR)—An aircrew member who is non-current or unqualified in the
aircraft, or incomplete in required continuation training.
Not Non-Mission Ready (NNMR)—An individual who is non-current on a training event not
applicable to the unit assigned MDS. Member must complete the delinquent training prior to
performing crew duties on the specific MDS, but maintains currency for the other universal
qualification MDS’.
AFI11-2AEV1_452AMWSUP 2 APRIL 2014                                                              83


Non-Universal AECM Qualification—AECMs with previous AE qualification prior to July
2005. AECMs qualified prior to this date were qualified as MDS specific AECMs or tri-qualified
and do not meet the requirement for universal qualification and must complete initial universal
AECM qualification.
Operational Training Mission (OTM)— A scheduled operational mission on which no patients
have been manifested for airlift. AECMs may utilize 2-4 hours to complete continuation training
requirements from Table 4.3. A basic crew complement of two FN and three AETs is required.
A MCC is also required for an OTM to facilitate the execution of scenarios, provide instructional
guidance on medical interventions, aircraft emergencies and document observations of
crewmember performance. NOTE: If a MCC trained AECM is not available, training is not
