                        EXTERNAL INTELLIGENCE TRAINING

3.1. Introduction. There are two types of external intelligence training (EIT): Aircrew
Intelligence Training (AIT) and Force Protection Intelligence Training (FPIT). AIT will be
coordinated with the wing/group tactics flight or officer. FPIT will be coordinated with force
protection (FP) organizations (e.g. Security Forces (SF), Air Force Office of Special
Investigations (AFOSI), etc.) as defined in AFI 14-119, Intelligence Support to Force Protection.
(T-2)
3.2. SIO Responsibilities. The SIO will:
   3.2.1. Establish an EIT program tailored to the unit’s mission, weapons systems, projected
   wartime/Air Expeditionary Force tasking and base/deployment location(s). (T-2)
   3.2.2. Appoint in writing an EIT program manager to oversee program execution. (T-3)
   3.2.3. Assign only qualified trainers to conduct unsupervised EIT events. Specialized
   training requirements and evaluation criteria for EIT trainers are identified in AFI 14-2A-10,
   Volumes 1 and 2. (T-2)
   3.2.4. Develop written guidance outlining procedures for conducting, documenting, testing,
   evaluating, monitoring and reporting EIT. List specific training objectives for each major
   area of intelligence training and the training method and resources used to satisfy each
   objective. (T-3)
   3.2.5. Coordinate EIT written instructions with all applicable commanders. Written
   guidance will be coordinated with any agency that assists intelligence personnel in providing
   training, as well as, any agency for which intelligence training is provided on a regularly
   scheduled basis. (T-3)
   3.2.6. Determine if other unit personnel require EIT and modify training requirements as
   appropriate. (T-3)
3.3. EIT Program Manager. The EIT program manager will:
   3.3.1. Build an effective training program, including training plans, with input from
   operational squadrons, tactics representatives, aircrew flight equipment (AFE) personnel, SF
   personnel, AFOSI, and Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) specialists, as
   appropriate. (T-2)
       3.3.1.1. Effective training methods will be used and can include, but are not limited to:
       briefings, demonstration-performance, formal and informal lectures, and academic
       training sessions.
       3.3.1.2. Training resources can include, but are not limited to technical intelligence
       briefings (TIB), threat briefings, current intelligence briefings, theater orientation
       briefings, CDs/DVDs or web-based training materials, and weapons system videos.

     3.3.3. Actively solicit feedback to ensure training objectives are meeting training
     requirements. (T-3)
     3.3.4. Conduct trend analysis following each training cycle; document lessons learned and
     apply those lessons during subsequent cycles. (T-3)
     3.3.5. Provide a written evaluation of the wing/group EIT program to the appropriate
     commander(s) at the end of each training cycle. The written evaluation will include at a
     minimum: the percent or number of personnel trained; trend analysis (high miss questions,
     weak areas, etc.); and corrective actions taken. Incorporate feedback as applicable. (T-3)
3.4. Aircrew Intelligence Training. AIT is EIT provided to the units assigned and attached
pilots. The assigned Intelligence Weapons Instructor Course (IWIC) or Intelligence Sensor and
Weapons Instructors Course (ISWIC) graduate will be directly responsible for the management
of the AIT program. When an IWIC or ISWIC graduate is not assigned, the SIO will manage the
AIT program. (T-3)
     3.4.1. Flying squadron intelligence personnel provide input to and execute the AIT program.
     (T-2) They will provide questions and answers specific to the squadron's mission for the unit
     MQF, administer AIT tests to pilots at the end of each training cycle, and document AIT
     provided. Documentation of AIT will include the names of personnel receiving training, date
     training was accomplished, the topic taught, and the name of the trainer conducting the
     training. In addition, they will provide a written evaluation of the squadron’s AIT program
     to the squadron commander and the EIT program manager (see Attachment 5). (T-3)
     3.4.2. The AIT plan will be specifically tailored to meet unit/mission requirements. Each
     item in the AIT training plan will be taught at least once during the training cycle. The plan
     will ensure the objectives for each AIT category outlined in paragraph 3.4.4 are evaluated
     with a test. All pilots covered by the training plan will pass each test with a minimum score
     of 85% correctable to 100% via a review of the missed test items with a qualified trainer. (T-
     3)
     3.4.3. Prorate training based on unit contingency operations tempo IAW AFI 11-2A-10,
     Volume 1. Details of the prorating schedule must be outlined in the AIT Plan and/or other
     written instructions. (T-3)
     3.4.4. Aircrew intelligence training categories include threat knowledge, visual recognition,
     personnel recovery, and collection and reporting. Additional categories can be added based
     on the unit’s operational mission. (T-2)
        3.4.4.1. Threat Knowledge Training. Develop specific threat knowledge training
        objectives tailored to the A-10, unit mission, local area, deployment base(s) and forward
        operating locations. Concentrate on threats in selected countries with the potential for
        direct unit involvement. The minimum standards for A-10 tailored TIBs and Threat-of-
        the-Day (TOD) are in Attachment 3. The references listed in paragraph 1.1.3 of this
        instruction can be supplemented with other classified and unclassified publications such
        as National Air and Space Intelligence Center products, Tactics Bulletins, Tactics
        Analysis Reports, Country Studies, etc. when developing threat knowledge training
        materials.

       enemy/adversary, friendly or neutral weapon systems that may be encountered in the
       operational environment, based on unit mission and operations plan/concept of operations
       plan (OPLAN/CONPLAN) tasking. Identify key differences between friendly weapons
       systems and threat weapon system look-alikes. Incorporate all aspects/angles, theater
       specific paint schemes, national markings and various configurations. Include examples
       of weapons employment to illustrate to pilots how threats might appear when employed
       (muzzle flashes, smoke plumes, burst patterns, etc.). Training should teach pilots how to
       describe threats they encounter to assist intelligence personnel in positive identification.
       3.4.4.3. Personnel Recovery (PR) Operational Support Training. When assigned, a
       SERE specialist will conduct PR operational support training. The SERE specialist will
       coordinate PR operations support training requirements with intelligence and AFE
       personnel and document these requirements in a memorandum of agreement (MOA).
       Units without SERE personnel will coordinate an MOA with AFE and operations. This
       category will be omitted if intelligence personnel do not provide any PR operational
       support training to pilots. If intelligence personnel do provide PR operational support
       training, address as a minimum: PR materials (Isolated Personnel Report (ISOPREP)
       maintenance and review, evasion plan of action (EPA) preparation) and theater combat
       recovery procedures.
       3.4.4.4. Collection and Reporting Training. Collection and reporting training will focus
       on items necessary to enable pilots to initiate pilot-originated reports (e.g. In-flight
       Report (INFLTREP)) and familiarize them with the information requirements of the
       intelligence-generated Mission Report (MISREP) and other intelligence reports. A
       critical component of this training will be the unit’s essential elements of information
       (EEIs). Training will identify and describe theater-specific and peacetime reporting
       requirements.
3.5. Force Protection Intelligence Training. FPIT is EIT provided by the host unit
intelligence function to the unit’s SF and other FP support agencies (AFOSI, Civil Engineering,
etc.). FPIT will be conducted IAW AFI 14-119 and supporting documents. When possible, a
Force Protection IFTU graduate will be responsible for the management of the FPIT program. If
the intelligence function is not part of the host unit, the tenant unit responsibilities in AFI 14-119
will be adhered to.
   3.5.1. The FPIT plan will ensure FPIT is conducted IAW AFI 14-119 and will be
   specifically tailored to meet unit/mission FP requirements. Each item in the FPIT training
   plan will be taught IAW the FP customers objectives. (T-2)
   3.5.2. All FPIT will be documented to include the names of personnel receiving training,
   date training was accomplished, the topic taught, and the name of the trainer conducting the
   training. In addition, provide a written evaluation of the FPIT program to the appropriate
   unit commander and the EIT program manager. (T-3)
   3.5.3. FPIT categories include intelligence roles and responsibilities, Area of Responsibility
   (AOR) hotspots, hostile forces, ground threat, landmines and improvised explosive devices.
   Additional categories can be added based on the unit’s operational mission. FPIT will meet
   the standards found in Attachment 4. (T-3)

           FORCE PROTECTION INTELLIGENCE TRAINING STANDARDS

A4.1. Force Protection Intelligence Training. Intelligence training for SF and other FP
support agencies must be focused on two primary educational goals: (1) roles, missions and
responsibilities of intelligence; (2) threat identification and capabilities.
A4.2. Minimum Requirements. The following requirements for FPIT provide a baseline of
important items that will be tailored for each unit’s specific mission, as required. FPIT should be
provided to SF and other support agencies to meet AFI 14-119, Intelligence Support to Force
Protection requirements. Units can add items to this list.

                       PILOT INTELLIGENCE TRAINING REPORT

MEMORANDUM FOR XX SQ/CC

FROM: XX OG/OGI

SUBJECT: Summary of Squadron Aircrew Intelligence Training (AIT)

1. The xx Fighter Squadron has 25 assigned combat mission ready (CMR) pilots. 78 percent of
pilots received 100 percent of their required intelligence training topics for this training cycle.
The status of intelligence training is listed below:
  XX FS Training Summary
  Total pilots                                                 25
  Avg. complete:                                               78%
  Most common topics not completed:                            SA-2
                                                               MiG-25
2. IAW the AIT Plan, each pilot is required to be trained on each training item at least once each
training cycle. At the completion of the training cycle, the following pilots have not completed
the annotated training items:
  Pilot                                           Intelligence Training Item
  John A. Doe                                     SA-2, MiG-25, Su-27
  Susan L. Smith                                  MiG-25
  Zane G. Thomas                                  SA-2/3/8, MiG-25
  Ed. D. Tyler                                    PR, ISOPREP
3. The annual Intelligence MQF test was administered on 15 Jan 11. All CMR pilots have taken
the 100 question test (50 questions and 50 visual recognition slides). While not all pilots
obtained the minimum passing score of 85 percent the first time around, all tests have been
corrected to 100 percent. A total of 25 pilots took the test. The initial average test score for the
squadron was 95 percent.
  XX FS Intelligence Test Results
  Total # pilots to take test                                  25
  # of questions                                               100
  Knowledge questions                                          50
  Knowledge questions—average score                            92%
  Knowledge questions—most commonly missed                     5 (SA-2)
                                                               8 (SA-6)
                                                               13 (MiG-29)
                                                               14 (Collection)
                                                               21 (Reporting)
  Visual Recognition Slides                                    50
  Visual Recognition—average score                             98%
  Visual Recognition—most commonly missed                      MiG-21
5. The most commonly missed questions were #5, 8, 13, 14 and 21. After further review of
questions 14 and 21, it is likely these questions were missed because they were poorly worded
AFI14-2A-10V3 18 May 2012                                                                     53


and difficult to understand. Questions 5, 8, and 13 focused on the SA-2, SA-6, and MiG-29
respectively. The squadron intelligence section will increase emphasis on these threat systems
during the next training cycle. Attached is a breakout of the test questions and how many times
each question was missed.
