       record decisions.
       3.4.8. Ensure each commander of the active duty member involved in a maltreatment
       incident receives a letter stating the determination for each incident. The letter will
       explain the Incident Status Determination Review process. The letter will serve as the
       active duty member's notification of incident status determination.
    3.5. Child Sexual Maltreatment Response Team (CSMRT) will:
       3.5.1. Establish, upon receipt of a child sexual abuse referral, the jurisdiction and how
       the organizations involved will proceed in making required notifications, conducting

       under their responsibility.

       3.5.8. Report to the FAC chair in the event there are multiple victims; the deployment of
       the Family Advocacy Command Assistance Team (FACAT) may be requested.
    3.6. High Risk for Violence Response Team (HRVRT) will:
       3.6.1. Be activated by the FAO upon notification of potential threat of harm by an
       individual to another family member or FAP staff. The HRVRT will assess the level of
       danger, then develop and implement a course of action to manage the risk of violence.
       3.6.2. Be convened by each FAP under the 501 CSW for installations under their
       responsibility. Membership includes FAO, FAP staff member(s) working with the

       child maltreatment cases. It is the policy of the 501 CSW/CC to provide appropriate
       services to members of the community as expeditiously as possible and to avoid
       duplication of services and agency efforts. Accordingly, all families referred to the FAP
       will receive timely assessments and will have their CRB under the direction of the FAC.
   3.8. Prevention and Outreach:
       3.8.1. Purpose is to enhance mission readiness by preventing the occurrence of child and
       spouse maltreatment. The FAP takes responsibility for coordinating among on and off
       base agencies regarding prevention and outreach programs for the members of the 501
       CSW communities through the installation Integrated Delivery System.
       3.8.2. Targeted populations are those portions of the 501 CSW population that have a
       high probability of being the first person outside the affected family to see indicators of
       family maltreatment. Those individuals identified require formal training on the
       recognition and reporting of incidents of family maltreatment.
       3.8.3. GSUs are exempt from using FAPNET/Outreach Prevention Automated Log
       (OPAL) to report statistics to higher headquarters.
4. Youth Supervision Guidelines. Attachment 2 to this operating instruction establishes Child
Supervision Guidelines for the 501 CSW communities. Violations of these guidelines require a
report to the FAP, but do not constitute an automatic opening of a family maltreatment record.
   4.1. All USAF personnel covered by this instruction are responsible for complying with and
   reporting violations of current installation child supervision guidelines. A violation of these
   guidelines requires a report to Family Advocacy, but does not constitute an automatic
   establishment of a family maltreatment record. When immediate action is required to protect
   the safety of a child, report violations to SFS or local police authorities.

Note 1: The ages specified are based on the average child’s ability to demonstrate age-
appropriate behavior. Children who do not consistently demonstrate age-appropriate behavior
should not be given the same degree of self-management responsibilities. In all instances below
where “yes” is indicated, the parent is responsible for using reasonable judgment and for any
incident or mishap (not considered preventable) that occurs.

Note 2: Baby monitors do not take the place of adult supervision and should only be used within
the home.

Note 3: Appropriate supervision is defined as someone who has or assumes responsibility for
the child, e.g., parent, guardian, care provider, friend.

Note 4: Red Cross baby-sitting training or equivalent required.

Note 5: The child must know that the adult is the point of contact for assistance, his/her location,
and how to contact him/her; and the adult needs to know they are assuming responsibility for the
child.
