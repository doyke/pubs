responsibilities and procedures in the event of an HLIS light illumination on 100 ARW or
transient KC-135R/T aircraft. The primary reference for interpretation and disposition of HLIS
events is TO 1C-135-2-11-40-7.
19.12.2. (Added-Mildenhall) The primary method for HLIS data download is through the
DDTU. Should the aircraft have an inoperative DDTU, technicians will use the Ground Readout
AFI21-101_AMCSUP_MILDENHALLSUP 9 AUGUST 2012                                                      37


Equipment to download the Flight Data Recorder and ensure they make a back-up copy of the
file, retain the back-up copy until disposition of data has been determined.
19.12.3. (Added-Mildenhall) If the HLIS data determines that a hard landing did occur,
submit an Engineering Technical Assistance Request (ETAR) into the Command 202 system to
Tinker Air Force Base for data verification.
19.12.4. (Added-Mildenhall) If the event is determined not to be a hard landing, AMXS
technicians will clear the HLIS light in accordance with the T.O. and complete “corrected by”
entries in the forms.
19.12.5. (Added-Mildenhall) If the aircraft is off station with a maintenance team, they will
download the DDTU and send the data back to RAF Mildenhall for analysis. If data cannot be
sent electronically, the data will be hand carried to a location where it can be analyzed. NOTE:
The aircraft will not be flown until the data has been analyzed and disposition from home station
is received.
19.13. (Added-Mildenhall) Cargo Loading Support Strut Procedures.
19.13.1. (Added-Mildenhall) IAW T.O. IC-135(K)R-2-2GA-1, Ground Handling, Servicing,
and Airframe USAF Aircraft KC-135R/T, Paragraph 2.3.5, the cargo loading support strut will
be installed upon completion of the aircraft parking and recovery task. It will remain installed
until within 6 hours of scheduled block time with the following exceptions:
19.13.1.1. (Added-Mildenhall)     When the aircraft is moving (towing, etc).
19.13.1.2. (Added-Mildenhall)     An engine is operating.
19.13.1.3. (Added-Mildenhall)     The aircraft is on alert status (the aircraft has been “sealed”).
19.13.1.4. (Added-Mildenhall) When directed otherwise by supervision, on a case by case
basis, MXG leadership is the lowest level of approval. If waived, MOC will be notified and
track any aircraft with no tail stand.
19.13.2. (Added-Mildenhall) A Red X will be entered in the forms anytime the tail stand is
installed, and signed off upon tail stand installation in the right keel beam bay IAW T.O. IC-
135(K)R-2-2JG-2 Task 2-34.
