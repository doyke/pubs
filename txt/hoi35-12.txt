and managerial elements in planning, producing and delivering briefings, reports and other
presentations and publications to selected audiences at decision-making levels. To accomplish
this mission, the division is organized into the following functional areas: graphics, television,
photography, presentations, reprographics and special projects.

 1.1. Graphics Branch SAF/AAIM: Pentagon, Room 5D950: This branch comprises a full-
 service in-house graphics design facility capable of fulfilling a wide variety of visual

 printers to 3D Routers and laser engravers. Traditional techniques of oil, acrylics, watercolor,
 pastels, pen & ink and graphite are utilized to incorporate original art with the latest techniques
 and technology available to the graphics industry.
