SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes include
stabilized approach criteria; use of automation; Verbalized, Verify, and Monitor; critical action
coordination; volcanic ash operations; Arrival/Departure Briefings; elimination of touch and go
certified ACs; fuel efficiency procedures; 18-hour Augmented Duty Day; MEL list; use of non-
mission related material; and VFR procedures. Major changes were a result of standardizing
AFI 11-2MDSv3 across all Mobility Air Forces (MAF) platforms. This document is based on
the AMC 11-2MDSv3 template. Some paragraphs were renumbered as a result.

                                            Chapter 2

                                COMMAND AND CONTROL

2.1. General. The Mobility Air Forces (MAF) command and control (C2) network consists of
the following C2 centers: 618 Air and Operations Center (AOC)(Tanker Airlift Control Center
[TACC]), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) or United States Air Forces Europe (USAFE) Air and
Space Operations Centers (AOCs), Air National Guard (ANG) Readiness Center, Air Force
Reserve Command (AFRC) Command Center, theater Air and Space Operations Centers (AOC),
Air Mobility Division (AMD), Joint Operational Support Airlift Center (JOSAC), Special Air
Missions Division, Office of Assistant Vice Chief of Staff, USAF (CVAM), Unit Command
Posts, Air Mobility Control Centers (AMCC), Contingency Response Groups (CRG),
Contingency Response Elements (CRE), and Special Tactics Teams (STT). C2 centers are action
agents for the MAF commander with execution authority (operational control) over mobility
missions/forces.
   2.1.1. (Added-439AW) 439 AW Command Post (CP) call sign is “CASINO ROYALE”.
   Primary UHF frequency is 252.1.
2.2. Execution Authority. Headquarters commanders with command authority over MAF
resources hold execution authority for directed missions. Commanders with execution authority
formulate plans, allocate assets, and approve missions through a local command post or C2
element. OG/CCs serve as execution authority for local training missions. The pilot in command
will execute missions operating outside normal communication channels (use last known mission
orders or best course of action).
   2.2.1. Off-Station Trainer (OST). Refer to MAJCOM instruction, for procedures and
   requirements.
       2.2.1.1. AFRC Current Operations (AFRC/A3OO) is approval authority for AFRC Unit
       Equipped (UE) OSTs.
   2.2.2. (Added-439AW) Crews shall coordinate changes and deviations to AFRC missions
   with AFRC Command Center. Keep 439 AW/CP informed of significant mission changes.
   Early return and after hours operations will be coordinated with and approved by 439 OG/CC
   through 439 AW/CP.
       2.2.2.1. (Added-439AW) Report any significant areas which may affect mission
       accomplishment or generate higher headquarters interest while away from home station
       to 337 AS/DO through 439 AW/CP.
2.3. Pilot in Command (PIC) Responsibility and Authority. SQ/CCs shall designate an
aircraft commander (AC), instructor pilot (IP), or evaluator pilot (EP) as the PIC for all flights,
on a flight authorization form, IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and applicable
supplements. PICs are:
   2.3.1. In command of all persons aboard the aircraft.
   2.3.2. Vested with authority to accomplish the assigned mission. The PIC shall only fly
   events authorized in the mission tasking unless, in the PIC’s judgment, an emergency
 18                                                AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


   condition demands otherwise. Fly unscheduled training events (e.g., air to air refueling
   (AAR) or transition training) only after obtaining approval of the execution authority.
   2.3.3. The final mission authority and will make decisions not assigned to higher authority.
   2.3.4. The final authority for requesting or accepting aircrew or mission waivers.
   2.3.5. Responsible for passing mission progress reports (at least daily) to C2 agents.
   2.3.6. Responsible for interaction between aircrew members and mission support personnel
   and will establish a point-of-contact (POC) with the appropriate C2 agent prior to entering
   crew rest. Local C2 agents are responsible for coordinating mission support requirements on
   the PIC’s behalf.
   2.3.7. Responsible for the welfare of aircrew members, Mission Essential Personnel (MEP),
   passengers, and the safe accomplishment of the mission.
2.4. Mission Clearance Decision. The execution authority and PIC shall make the mission
clearance decision. In all cases, final responsibility for the safe conduct of the mission rests with
the PIC. If a PIC elects to delay a mission, that mission will not depart until the conditions that
generated the decision to delay improve or are resolved. Further, no execution authority may task
another PIC to take the same mission under the same conditions.
   2.4.1. Only re-route or divert a mission when authorized by the execution authority, to
   resolve an emergency, or if required due to insufficient fuel or en route or terminal weather
   conditions.
   2.4.2. The agent that directed the re-route or divert shall ensure the aircraft is capable of
   executing departure, en route, and destination arrival procedures.
   2.4.3. The PIC will notify the appropriate C2 agent of any aircraft or aircrew limitation that
   may preclude re-route or divert.
   2.4.4. When a C2 agent directs a PIC to fly to an alternate airfield, the agent will ensure
   existing and forecast weather for the alternate, Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs), and airfield
   information from the Global Decision Support System (GDSS)/GDSS2/Airfield Suitability
   and Restrictions Report (ASRR), are suitable. If the alternate becomes unsuitable while en
   route, coordinate with the C2 agent for other suitable alternates. The PIC is final authority for
   accepting a suitable alternate. A C2 agent will alert customs and all appropriate ground
   service agencies to prepare for arrival.
2.5. Operational C2 Reporting.
   2.5.1. Stations With MAF C2 Agency. Local MAF C2 agents will enter mission data
   (arrival, departure, and advisory messages) in the MAF C2 system.
   2.5.2. Stations Without MAF C2 Agency. Transmit mission data (arrival, departure, and
   advisory messages) to the controlling C2 agency by any means available (preference in the
   following order, DSN, Airline Operational Control (AOC), HF, Iridium Phone, AERO-I).
   For critical C2 communications, i.e. aircraft waiver request, maintenance delay, etc., voice
   communications are the primary method.
   2.5.3. En route Reporting.
       2.5.3.1. Make the following en route calls to 618 AOC (TACC):
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                           19


         2.5.3.1.1. Airborne call when departing from a location without an AMC presence.
         2.5.3.1.2. Maintenance call whenever aircraft maintenance status changes to code A-
         3.
         2.5.3.1.3. On aeromedical evacuation missions, no later than 1 hour prior to landing,
         to update arrival time and provide AF Form 3858, C-130/C-141 Aeromedical
         Evacuation Off-load Message information.
         2.5.3.1.4. Uncoordinated aircraft interceptions via the most expeditious means
         available, after complying with guidance in the flight information handbook. When
         an airborne report is not accomplished, PICs must directly notify 618 AOC (TACC)
         upon landing. In all cases ensure local C2 and Intel agencies are informed.
     2.5.3.2. CONUS. Periodic “ops normal” calls/transmissions are not required; however,
     the controlling C2 agency may increase reporting requirements.
     2.5.3.3. OCONUS. MAJCOM C2 agencies will specify increased reporting procedures
     through a communications plan in the OPLAN, OPORD, FRAG, Mission Directive, or
     FLIP. Aircrews will maintain listening watch in accordance with the communications
     plan within aircraft equipment capabilities (e.g. UHF/VHF, HF, SATCOM, AOC).
  2.5.4. Aircraft Status/Maintenance Discrepancy Reporting. PICs shall report aircraft system
  malfunctions that traditionally require extensive trouble shooting as soon as feasible. Contact
  arrival C2 agency if available, otherwise contact MAJCOM C2 for relay.
  2.5.5. Aerial Refueling Mission Reports.
     2.5.5.1. Receiver AAR Report. On operational missions, PICs shall report the AAR
     information to the destination C2 agency after landing, if unable to relay information
     inflight. C2 agencies will enter the information in the MAF C2 system for missions under
     their control. The MAJCOM C2 agency will enter the data for all missions. Include all
     scheduled ARs not accomplished. Use the following format:
         2.5.5.1.1. AAR track.
         2.5.5.1.2. Scheduled On-load.
         2.5.5.1.3. Actual Onload.
         2.5.5.1.4. Reason Code.
         2.5.5.1.5. Additional Comments.
     2.5.5.2. Reason Codes. Reason codes indicate the outcome of aerial refueling activity.
     Codes are normally used when a problem or situation affects the successful
     accomplishment of the aerial refueling. The Reason Code “AC” will be used when aerial
     refueling was complete without delay or mission impact. Additional comments are
     mandatory for all reason codes except AT, WX, and AC.
         2.5.5.2.1. RO-Receiver Operations.
         2.5.5.2.2. RM-Receiver Maintenance.
         2.5.5.2.3. RW-Receiver Weather.
         2.5.5.2.4. TO-Tanker Operations.

         2.5.5.2.5. TM-Tanker Maintenance.
         2.5.5.2.6. TW-Tanker Weather.
         2.5.5.2.7. AT-Air Traffic Control.
         2.5.5.2.8. WX-Aerial Refueling Track Adverse Weather.
         2.5.5.2.9. AC-Aerial Refueling Complete.
  2.5.6. “Thirty Minute” Out Call. Transmit a UHF or VHF arrival advisory to the destination
  C2 agency approximately 30 minutes prior to arrival. Provide Estimated Time in Blocks
  (ETB).
  2.5.7. Integrated Flight Management (IFM) Sorties. On IFM sorties, the flight managers
  (FM) will be the C2 conduit for aircrews. For critical C2 communications, voice
  communications are the primary method. EXCEPTION: For AFRC/ANG missions using
  IFM, AFRC/ANG will provide C2.
     2.5.7.1. Position Reporting on IFM Missions. IFM missions transiting oceanic flight
     information regions (FIRs) need to add the phrase “Pass to Hilda” to ATC position
     reports (N/A for datalink sorties). Crews may also use the ARINC frequencies listed in
     the aircrew flimsy for C2 phone patch requirements. Use ARINC phone patch only after
     exhausting normal communication methods.
  2.5.8. C-5M and AMP modified aircraft communications:
     2.5.8.1. AOC. For 618 AOC (TACC) flight managed missions, AOC is the primary
     means of communication with the flight manager. If AOC is inoperative, use AERO-I or
     HF as alternates.
     2.5.8.2. AERO-I. AERO-I may be used for routine communication (secondary to AOC).
     AERO-I voice is a backup for the Controller to Pilot Datalink Communication (CPDLC)
     and C2 communications (datalink and VHF/HF voice). NOTE: The AERO-I
     communications logs onto a specific ground earth station (GES) based on aircraft
     location. Manually selecting a different GES using constrained log-on procedures will
     result in connection through a non-contract carrier and should only be used when all other
     avenues of communication have failed.
     2.5.8.3. HF radios may be operated in Datalink mode for AOC messaging only. Due to
     certification issues, HF radios will not be placed in the Datalink mode while any ATC
     messaging is utilized. This includes the entire period from initiating CPDLC and logon to
     ATC through disconnect of CPDLC.
     2.5.8.4. ADS. On C-5M and AMP modified C-5 aircraft, Automatic Dependent
     Surveillance (ADS) automatically reports aircraft position. This feature should be turned
     off for missions operating through sensitive or classified locations.
     2.5.8.5. EDS. On C-5M aircraft, the Embedded Diagnostic System (EDS) is equipped
     with position recording. This feature should be turned off for missions operating through
     sensitive or classified locations. The EDS help menu contains directions on disabling the
     Sensitive Recording feature.
  2.5.9. Legacy aircraft communications:
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                            21


      2.5.9.1. HF is the primary means of access to the worldwide C2 network. The secondary
      HF radio should be operated in Automatic Link Establishment (ALE) mode to support
      voice contacts between the PIC and MAJCOM C2. NOTE: Run the ALE system in the
      silent mode during flights where pilots use the HF radio system for communication with
      ATC.
   2.5.10. Not used.
   2.5.11. DV Messages. Airborne unclassified messages originated by DV passengers may be
   transmitted at the discretion of the PIC.
   2.5.12. Iridium Phone. Iridium phones may be used for communications between aircrews
   and command and control agencies when beyond-line of sight C2 is required and other line
   of sight communications, HF or SAT-2000 do not provide proper security or timeliness. For
   more information, refer to AMC Iridium Satellite Phone CONOPS for Aircrews,

   E044080020E329A9
      2.5.12.1. Turn off Iridium phones within 25 feet of ground refueling operations.
      2.5.12.2. Turn off Iridium phones during takeoff, receiver air refueling, approach, and
      landing.
2.6. Mission Commander (MC).
   2.6.1. Unit commanders shall designate a MC when more than two aircraft are assembled to
   perform missions away from home station. Unit commanders should consider appointing a
   MC for special, high-visibility missions (i.e. CAPSTONE, DV2, etc.). The MC has overall
   responsibility and is the final authority for decisions that impact mission execution. The MC
   shall properly coordinate mission details. For flight-managed sorties, MC shall coordinate
   any special mission planning requirements with the IFM mission allocator not later than 24
   hours prior to mission execution.
      2.6.1.1. For MAJCOM-tasked missions, MAJCOM/A3 will coordinate and designate a
      lead planning agency when more than one unit is involved in an AAR, airdrop, or tactical
      airland operation. For AMC-tasked missions the planning agency is 618 AOC (TACC).
      For theater airlift missions with more than one airlift unit involved, the theater AOC shall
      designate a central planning agency responsible for coordinating the entire mission with
      all involved agencies. The OG/CC for the lead planning agency will designate a MC. The
      MC will be a rated (normally field grade) officer qualified in the type mission.
      2.6.1.2. The MC will ensure all collocated aircrew members attend required briefings.
      2.6.1.3. When non-collocated, the MC (in conjunction with the lead planning agency)
      will ensure non-collocated aircrew members receive applicable information, to include
      rendezvous, formation, abort, and recovery procedures. The MC will provide controlling
      agency and all non-collocated PICs anticipated delays or mission changes.
2.7. C2 Agency Telephone Numbers. Crewmembers may use the 618 AOC (TACC) toll-free
number, 1-800-AIR-MOBL or DSN 312-779-0320 to contact other offices within the 618 AOC
(TACC), including flight managers.

2.8. Close Watch Missions. Close Watch missions (e.g., Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR),
Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) and PHOENIX BANNERs) receive special C2 attention. PICs
will promptly notify appropriate C2 agency of delays, aborts, or other events that affect on-time
departure. Provide the C2 agent the estimated time in commission (ETIC), planned ETD, and
estimated time of arrival (ETA) within 10 minutes of the event or as soon as safety allows.
2.9. Law Enforcement Support. It is the policy of the Department of Defense (DoD) to
cooperate with civilian law enforcement officials to the maximum extent practicable. AFI 10-
801, Assistance to Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies, provides the policies and procedures
service members must follow when supporting federal, state, and local civilian law enforcement
agencies. Coordinate all civilian law enforcement authorities’ requests for assistance through
appropriate C2 channels.
2.10. En route Maintenance Support. 618 AOC/XOCL will support all mobility aircraft
requests for parts and/or maintenance assistance on TRANSCOM/AMC missions.

                                          Chapter 3

                        AIRCFREW COMPLEMENT/MANAGEMENT

3.1. General. This chapter provides guiding principles to form/manage mobility aircrews.
Commanders at all levels shall follow these policies to form aircrews and to develop aircrew-
related work/rest schedules that optimize efficiency of mobility forces engaged in worldwide
operations.
3.2. Aircrew Complement. SQ/CCs shall form aircrews based on fragmentation order/mission
directive, Crew Duty Time (CDT) and Flight Duty Period (FDP) requirements, aircrew member
qualifications, and other constraints to safely accomplish the mission tasking. Table 3.1. below
summarizes crew position requirements for different crew types.
   3.2.1. The minimum aircrew member complement for a local training flight is the same as
   for a basic crew. EXCEPTION: Loadmasters are only required on locals carrying passengers
   or cargo. NOTE: Ballast for SCM-modified aircraft is not considered cargo. When a mission
   requires more than one aircrew member at a position, the SQ/CC will determine whether an
   instructor and NMR crewmember meet mission requirements.
   3.2.2. SQ/CCs shall form augmented aircrews for missions planned to take longer than a
   basic CDT. Augmenting aircrew members must be current, qualified, and Mission Ready
   (MR) IAW AFI11-2C-5V1, C-5 Aircrew Training. EXCEPTIONS: A NMR pilot (non-
   current, qualified) may be used as an augmentee provided the PIC is a fully qualified, MR
   instructor, and the NMR (non-current) pilot is regaining currency (e.g., overseas sortie).
   SQ/CC shall augment an aircrew for the full FDP. The MAJCOM/A3 may augment aircrews
   while the mission is in execution. (See paragraph 3.7., Aircrew Management, for more on
   CDT/FDP.)

Table 3.1. Aircrew Complement.

NOTES:
1. A basic crew requires an aircraft commander and another pilot. An augmented crew requires an
aircraft commander and two pilots.
2. On AAR missions, an aircraft commander and flight engineer will be AAR-qualified. Another pilot
 24                                               AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


will be AAR-trained.
3. One first and one second engineer (or higher) are required for a basic crew (minimum)
4. Two first engineers or higher are required for an augmented crew (minimum).
5. The designated primary loadmaster should be at least a C-5 Loadmaster journeyman on career status.
6. Two loadmasters required for all basic airlift missions (schedule three when resources are available)
to include passenger loads up to 73 in the troop compartment.
7. One loadmaster required for all AAR training missions with cargo or passengers on board.
8. When ten or less passengers are carried on local training missions, only one loadmaster is required.
9. Two qualified Loadmasters must be in the Troop Compartment during critical phases of flight when
passengers are carried in the troop compartment. During cruise flight only one Loadmaster is required
to be in the Troop Compartment with passengers.

3.3. Aircrew Member Qualification. An aircrew member will be qualified, or in qualification
training to perform duties as a primary aircrew member.
   3.3.1. Senior leaders who complete a Senior Staff Qualification course (restricted AF Form
   8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification) or orientation for a Senior Staff Familiarization flight
   may occupy a primary crew position when under direct instructor supervision. Refer to AFI
   11-401, Aviation Management, for procedures and requirements governing senior leader
   flying.
   3.3.2. Crewmembers who complete the Senior Staff Course will log “FP” for Flight
   Authorization Duty Code on the AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data
   Document.
   3.3.3. Crewmembers who complete a Senior Staff Familiarization flight will log “OP” for
   Flight Authorization Duty Code on the AFTO Form 781.
3.4. Pilots. An instructor pilot (IP) must supervise non-current or unqualified pilots regaining
currency or qualification (direct IP supervision during critical phases of flight).
   3.4.1. SQ/CCs shall augment the PIC for missions over 16 hours Flight Duty Period (FDP)
   in accordance with paragraph 3.2.2 and Table 3.1. Designate those additional pilots
   authorized to perform PIC duties, if applicable. The PIC shall brief the aircrew on the plan to
   transfer PIC duties.
   3.4.2. Initial qualification pilots enrolled in a MAJCOM approved training course may
   accomplish tanker/receiver AAR under ARIP supervision.
   3.4.3. Missions with passengers. Only current and qualified pilots (possessing an AF Form
   8) will occupy pilot seats with passengers on board (N/A MEP).
       3.4.3.1. A non-current but qualified pilot may fly with passengers on board if under
       direct IP supervision.
       3.4.3.2. Pilots shall not fly touch-and-go landings with passengers on board. Touch-and-
       go and stop-and-go landings are authorized with Mission Essential Personnel (MEP) on
       board.
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                               25


   3.4.4. Pilots on duty familiarization flights will be monitored by another qualified pilot in the
   observer’s seat.
3.5. Not Used.
3.6. Flight Engineers and Loadmasters. A non-current or unqualified flight engineer or
loadmaster may serve as a primary aircrew member on any mission when supervised by a
qualified instructor or flight examiner (direct supervision for critical phases of flight).
3.7. Aircrew Management. SQ/CCs and en route C2 agents shall ensure work/rest cycles
permit an aircrew adequate time to safely accomplish mission duties and personal time for rest.
   3.7.1. Flight Duty Period (FDP). FDP is the period of time starting at mission report time
   and ending immediately after the aircrew completes the final engine shutdown of the day.
   SQ/CCs shall form aircrews based on worst-case FDP in the mission directive. Once en
   route, the mission directive or C2 agent will inform the PIC of expected FDP at show time.
   Reduce FDP when the autopilot pitch axis fails after departure IAW information below. If
   the autopilot fails after departure, consider mission requirements and determine the best
   course of action to preclude further mission delays due to reduced FDP. The best course of
   action may include diverting to an airfield with maintenance capability. Contact C2,
   coordinate intentions, and comply with limitations.
       3.7.1.1. Basic Crew FDP. The maximum FDP for a basic aircrew is 16 hours (12 hours
       when the autopilot pitch axis servo is inoperative or the pitch autopilot cannot be coupled
       to the FMS). All AAR and tactical events will be accomplished within the first 14 hours
       of the FDP. Once an aircrew begins a basic FDP, only MAJCOM/A3 may extend it to an
       augmented day regardless of aircrew composition (MAJCOM/A3 shall augment basic
       crew to extend FDP).
          3.7.1.1.1. When extended en route ground times, non-optimum routing/winds,
          weather delays or other extenuating circumstances will increase a basic to an
          augmented FDP, a PIC with an augmented crew may accept an augmented FDP as
          long as:
              3.7.1.1.1.1. The C2 agent or PIC discovers the extenuating circumstances before
              the first takeoff of the day.
              3.7.1.1.1.2. The PIC verifies all augmenting aircrew members can get adequate
              rest en route.
          3.7.1.1.2. A PIC with a basic crew may seek MAJCOM/A3 (mission execution
          authority) approval to extend the FDP as much as 2 hours to complete a scheduled
          mission. Only use this provision to recover from unscheduled/unplanned en route
          delays. C2 agents shall not ask PICs to exercise this option.
       3.7.1.2. Augmented Crew FDP. Maximum FDP for an augmented aircrew is 24 hours
       (16 hours when the autopilot pitch axis is inoperative or the pitch autopilot cannot be
       coupled to the FMS). All AAR and tactical events will be completed within the first 18
       hours of the FDP. SQ/CC need only augment the pilot portion of the aircrew when the
       autopilot pitch axis is inoperative since the aircrew is restricted to a basic FDP (16 hours).
26                                            AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


         3.7.1.2.1. SQ/CC will augment an aircrew when FDP exceeds 16 hours and the
         mission profile will allow augmenting aircrew members’ adequate time to rest en
         route. As a minimum, the mission profile must provide the following:
            3.7.1.2.1.1. No more than 2 intermediate stops after 16 hours of FDP (each
            receiver AAR shall count as an intermediate stop).
            3.7.1.2.1.2. Actual mission profile shall include at least one 6 hour leg or two 4
            hour legs. EXCEPTION: If the mission profile does not meet the leg length
            criteria above but includes at least one 5 hour leg or two 3 hour legs, the
            maximum FDP will be 18 hours. All A/R and tactical events will be accomplished
            within the first 14 hours of the FDP. Once an aircrew begins an 18 hour
            augmented day, only MAJCOM/A3/DO may extend it to a 24 hour augmented
            day. (All other restrictions still apply)
            3.7.1.2.1.3. The PIC shall validate planned leg times based on actual conditions.
            PICs may swap an extended ground time (4 hours) for a mission leg when
            conditions afford aircrew members a chance for rest.
     3.7.1.3. Not used.
     3.7.1.4. Flight examiners administering evaluations will not exceed an augmented FDP.
     3.7.1.5. Training, Tactical, Joint Airborne/Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT), and
     Functional Check Flights/Acceptance Check Flights (FCFs/ACFs) FDP:
         3.7.1.5.1. 16 hours (12 hours when the autopilot pitch axis is inoperative or the
         autopilot cannot be coupled to the FMS). Conduct the mission as follows:
         3.7.1.5.2. Complete all mission-related events (i.e., FCF/ACF checks, transition
         events, AAR or tactical events) during the first 12 hours of the FDP.
            3.7.1.5.2.1. ANG and AFRC crews may perform all mission-related events on
            local training missions provided their time from start of CDT/FDP does not
            exceed 16 hours.
                3.7.1.5.2.1.1. Crew duty time (CDT) and FDP include both military duty and
                civilian work. CDT and FDP begin when an individual reports for their first
                duty period (military or civilian).
         3.7.1.5.3. Crews may fly/deposition to home station or a deployed staging base
         following training (do not exceed 12 hours when the pitch autopilot is inoperative).
  3.7.2. Crew Duty Time (CDT). CDT is that period of time an aircrew may perform
  combined ground/flight duties. Plan the mission so aircrew members may complete post-
  mission duties within maximum CDT. An aircrew member may perform mission-related
  duties for other missions when approved by member’s home station SQ/CC or equivalent.
  Maximum CDT is 18 hours for a basic aircrew and 24+45 hours for an augmented aircrew.
  3.7.3. Except as outlined below, CDT/FDP begins 1 hour after aircrew alert notification.
  SQ/CC or equivalent may task aircrew members to perform other duties before they begin
  flight-related duties or MAJCOM/A3 may authorize a C2 agent to alert an aircrew member
  early. Begin CDT/FDP when the first aircrew member reports for those duties.
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                         27


      3.7.3.1. Crews may self-alert with C2 (618 AOC [TACC] for AMC and AMC gained
      missions) concurrence prior to entering crew rest. The PIC must coordinate (618 AOC
      [TACC] approval required for AMC and AMC-gained missions) the self-alert time
      before entering crew rest. Begin CDT/FDP when the first aircrew member reports for
      duty.
      3.7.3.2. CDT/FDP Extensions. See AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules.
   3.7.4. Mission Essential Personnel (MEP) Time. IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management,
   MAF aircrew members may travel as additional crewmembers (not required for the mission
   being flown, but required for follow-on missions) as MEP. MEP will not be listed on the
   AFTO Form 781, will not log time, and will not accrue OFDA credit. Crewmembers may
   travel as MEP for a maximum of 24 hours. OG/CC or equivalent may approve crewmembers
   to travel as MEP in excess of 24 hours.
      3.7.4.1. Current/qualified aircrew members may perform primary aircrew duties after
      traveling in MEP status, provided they do not exceed a basic FDP (FDP starts at report
      time for flight in MEP status).
      3.7.4.2. Aircrew members may travel in MEP status after performing primary crew
      duties, for a maximum of 24 hours from the time the crewmember’s FDP began.
   3.7.5. Aircrew Member Support of Aircraft Generation Activities (Pre-flight, cargo up-/off-
   load, start, and taxi aircraft). Crew rest is required IAW AFI 11-202V3. The duty day begins
   when the aircrew member reports for official duties.
   3.7.6. (Added-439AW) Individual Crewmembers Departing the Crew Prior to Mission
   Completion. Some circumstances (civilian job, emergency leave, SRT, etc.) may require
   crew members to return home prior to mission completion. The aircraft commander will call
   the 337 AS/DO or 439 OG/CC to advise them of the situation and obtain approval prior to
   arranging for return travel.
3.8. Scheduling Restrictions. IAW AFI 11-202V3. In addition, SQ/CCs shall not schedule an
aircrew member to fly nor will an aircrew member perform aircrew duties:
   3.8.1. When the flight will exceed maximum flying time limitations of AFI 11-202V3.
   3.8.2. Within 12 hours of consuming alcoholic beverages (based on scheduled takeoff, or
   ALFA standby force legal for alert time, or earliest show time from BRAVO alert) or while
   impaired by its after effects.
   3.8.3. When using nasal sprays to treat symptoms of head congestion existing before flight.
   An aircrew member may use oxymetazoline or phenylephrine nasal sprays as “get-me-
   downs” following an unexpected ear or sinus block during flight. Following use,
   crewmember will be considered DNIF until cleared by a flight surgeon.
3.9. Fatigue Countermeasures Management Program.
   3.9.1. Aircrew may use medications with prior approval (on a voluntary basis following
   ground testing) that enhance natural rest during off-cycle crew rest periods. This section
   provides guidance for the use of no-go pills (prescription medications) that help aircrew
   initiate and maintain restful sleep during off-cycle (circadian desynchronosis) crew rest
   periods. Fliers shall not use no-go pills in flight.
28                                              AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


  3.9.2. It is USAF policy that aircrew shall never use no-go pills as a first choice counter-
  fatigue management (CM) tool. Proper sleep/rest cycles represent the primary fatigue CM,
  with ‘smart’ scheduling procedures and napping techniques (inflight and/or ground-based)
  augmenting this primary CM. Flight surgeons will educate aircrew members about these and
  other fatigue CM.
  3.9.3. Responsibility for counter-fatigue management of aircrew medicinal products rests
  with the home station Flight Surgeon (FS) and with each individual aircrew member.
  Aircrew members may obtain no-go pills from any USAF or other authorized flight surgeon.
  During extended deployments, aircrew members will only obtain no-go pills from a deployed
  USAF flight surgeon. The deployed flight surgeon shall consult with the home unit medical
  team prior to dispensing no-go pills to deployed fliers.
  3.9.4. Unit Operational Risk Management (ORM) programs shall include use of no-go
  medication with OG/CC and FS oversight. A basic counter-fatigue ORM model is available
  for mission planners, OG/CC, crew, and FS at the AMC/A3V website. Training materials are
  available at the local FS office.
  3.9.5. Home station or deployed FSs trained using the AMC/SG-approved (lead command)
  fatigue countermeasures materials program are the point of contact for no-go prescription.
  3.9.6. Aircrew members on Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) status will follow PRP
  notification procedures if prescribed no-go pills.
  3.9.7. Aircrew will consider the following examples of missions prone to causing fatigue
  (may cause sleep disruptions) in their decision to use no-go medications:
     3.9.7.1. Home station night launch missions (with 2000-0530L show times) greater than
     four hours duration.
     3.9.7.2. Crew rest facilities lacking an optimal sleeping environment (quiet, air-
     conditioned, and darkened).
     3.9.7.3. Off-station missions that are 4 or more time zones from home station.
     3.9.7.4. Rotating schedules (stair-stepped flying schedules) with greater than 6-hour
     flight time duration.
     3.9.7.5. Missions that run consistently near a 14-hour (or greater) duty day.
  3.9.8. In no case will crewmembers consume a no-go pill on a timeline where they would be
  under the effect of the medication while they perform aircrew duties (use mission report or
  legal for alert time to determine latest time to take no-go medication). SQ/CC will not
  schedule crewmembers to fly or perform crew duties during the following minimum DNIF
  periods for consuming no-go pills.
     3.9.8.1. Restoril (temazepam) – 12 hours minimum DNIF.
     3.9.8.2. Ambien (zolpidem) – 6 hours minimum DNIF.
     3.9.8.3. Sonata (zaleplon) – 4 hours minimum DNIF.
  3.9.9. Accountability for this program is made challenging by the worldwide mobility
  mission of AMC/MAF aircrew; therefore, the following are aircrew member’s
  responsibilities:
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                           29


      3.9.9.1. Aircrew members will complete ground testing for each no-go pill and receive
      flight surgeon clearance prior to using a particular no-go pill in the flying environment.
      3.9.9.2. Aircrew members shall not operate heavy equipment or perform aircrew duties
      during the minimum DNIF period for each no-go pill outlined in paragraph 3.9.8.
      3.9.9.3. Aircrew members shall not take no-go-pills within 12 hours of consuming
      alcohol, or vice versa.
      3.9.9.4. Aircrew members will fill out an AMC-approved (lead command) “No-Go Pill
      Usage Questionnaire” detailing how they used their last prescription when requesting a
      refill from the FS.
      3.9.9.5. Limit use of Restoril (temazepam) and Ambien (zolpidem) to a maximum of
      seven consecutive days and no more than 20 days in a 60-day period. In order to support
      dynamic MAF mission requirements, FS will consider providing a prescription for 60
      days (20 pills) at a time if requested by the aircrew member.
      3.9.9.6. Limit use of Sonata (zaleplon) to a maximum of 10 consecutive days and no
      more than 28 days in a 60-day period. In order to support dynamic MAF mission
      requirements, FS will consider providing a prescription for 60 days (28 pills) at a time if
      requested by the aircrew member.
      3.9.9.7. Aircrew will inform the FS of any other medications (including nutritional
      supplements and over the counter medications) they are taking so the FS can evaluate
      potential interactions.
3.10. Crew Rest/En route Ground Time. OG/CCs shall establish procedures to place
crewmembers in crew rest. MAJCOM/A3/DO may waive any portion of the crew rest period or
ground time as needed to meet mission tasking.
   3.10.1. Home-Station Pre-Departure Crew Rest. For missions that will keep aircrew
   members off station 16 hours or more, unit commanders will enter primary and deadhead
   aircrew members into pre-departure crew rest 24 hours before the legal for alert time.
   Aircrew members may perform limited non-flying duties like mission planning during the
   first 12 hours of pre-departure crew rest. OG/CCs may waive any portion of the first 12 hours
   of pre-departure crew rest. Do not manifest deadhead aircrew members as passengers to deny
   pre-departure crew rest. EXCEPTION: AFRC and ANG in accordance with AFI 11-202V3
   and appropriate supplement.
   3.10.2. Off-station/En route Crew Rest. The minimum en route crew rest period is 12 hours
   before legal for alert or scheduled report time when self-alerting.
      3.10.2.1. Except during emergencies or as authorized by MAJCOM/A3, C2 agents shall
      not disturb an aircrew member in crew rest. When necessary to interrupt aircrew
      members’ crew rest period, re-enter that aircrew in a subsequent minimum 12 hour crew
      rest period after they complete official duties.
      3.10.2.2. Do not enter aircrew members into crew rest until they complete official post-
      flight duties. Those duties may include, but are not limited to, refueling, cargo on-/off-
      load, aircrew arming, minor maintenance, or mission debriefing.
30                                                AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


  3.10.3. Off-station/En route Ground Time. Mobility planners shall provide aircrews at least
  17 hours ground time between engine shutdown and subsequent takeoff.
     3.10.3.1. Mission planners, PICs, or C2 agents may modify ground time as follows:
         3.10.3.1.1. In the interest of safety.
         3.10.3.1.2. To start (mission reporting time) no earlier than 12 hours from the time
         the aircrew entered crew rest. Before reducing ground time, PICs will consider time
         to complete mission planning, cargo on-/off-load, and non-standard mission related
         duties. C2 agents will not ask PICs to accept less than 17 hours ground time.
     3.10.3.2. Mobility planners should construct mission itineraries with en route ground
     times longer than 17 hours to afford aircrew members opportunities to recover from the
     cumulative effects of fatigue caused by flying on several consecutive days or due to
     transiting several time zones. If practical, make the en route ground time 36 hours
     (maximum) after three consecutive near maximum FDPs.
  3.10.4. Crew Enhancement Crew Rest (CECR). CECR is not an alternative to a safety-of-
  flight delay but provides PICs a means to minimize the adverse effects of a crew alert and
  report period outside normal duty time. CECR periods should be of minimum duration and
  are normally used during de-positioning legs. Tasking authorities shall approve requests to
  delay alert time to normalize the work-rest cycle or increase messing options when mission
  allows. When requests are disapproved, the C2 agent will inform the PIC of the reason for
  disapproval.
  3.10.5. Post-Mission Crew Rest (PMCR). SQ/CCs shall give aircrew members returning to
  home base sufficient time to recover from cumulative effects of the mission and tend to
  personal needs. PMCR begins upon mission termination. (N/A AFRC and ANG).
     3.10.5.1. For missions that keep an aircrew off station 16 or more hours, the SQ/CC shall
     provide 1 hour (up to 96 hours) PMCR for each 3 hours off-station. Do not enter aircrew
     members in pre-departure crew rest until the PMCR period expires.
     3.10.5.2. PMCR is not applicable to continuing missions and MAJCOM/A3 may
     suspend PMCR during contingency operations.
     3.10.5.3. OG/CCs (or equivalents) are PMCR waiver authority.
  3.10.6. Crew Chief Work/Rest Plan. While on Temporary Duty (TDY), the deployed crew
  chief or MEP maintenance technician shall report to the PIC. In conjunction with en
  route/transient maintenance supervisor, the PIC will determine how long the crew chief can
  safely perform aircraft maintenance duties. The PIC shall ensure the crew chief has sufficient
  time in each 24-hour period to get 8 hours of uninterrupted rest. See AFI 21-101, Aircraft
  and Equipment Maintenance Management, for detailed guidance.
  3.10.7. The lead USAF component will publish MAJCOM/A3 approved crew rest criteria in
  the Exercise or Contingency Operation Order (OPORD), Operation Plan (OPLAN) or
  Concept of Operations (CONOPs).
  3.10.8. The Prime Knight program streamlines the process of getting aircrews from aircraft
  parking ramp into lodging/crew rest. It is only successful when billeting agents receive
  accurate aircrew/mission information in a timely manner.
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                            31


       3.10.8.1. C2 Agent Responsibilities. A MAJCOM C2 agent will forward information on
       the departing aircrew’s orders to a point of contact (POC) for the next crew rest
       location’s Prime Knight function.
       3.10.8.2. PIC Responsibilities. If departing from a location with a C2 agency, ensure a
       C2 agent has accurate aircrew/mission information to forward to the next Prime Knight
       POC. If departing from a facility without a C2 agency, the PIC will call the next crew rest
       location Prime Knight POC to pass aircrew/mission information.
       3.10.8.3. SQ/CC or designated authenticating official shall ensure TDY/Flight orders
       clearly indicate the unit fund cite so that the PIC may make Prime Knight reservations in
       advance. Without unit funds cite on the TDY/Flight orders, the PIC must make advance
       reservations using a government travel card to participate in the Prime Knight program.
3.11. Alerting Procedures. MAJCOM C2 agents shall establish a legal for alert time with the
PIC and when appropriate, the Medical Crew Director (MCD) of Aeromedical Evacuation (AE)
crews. Whenever possible, C2 agents will inform PICs and MCDs of aircraft status, expected
patient up load time, and other pertinent mission details that will streamline mission launch.
NOTE: Aircraft Commanders will not be asked to accept Legal for Bravo unless the LFB time
is equal to or later than the firm ETIC and consideration is given to factors affecting mission
launch i.e. maintenance personnel and parts on station, slot times, airfield operating hours,
diplomatic clearances, etc.
   3.11.1. Aircrew alert time is normally 4+15 hours before scheduled takeoff time (allows 1
   hour for reporting and 3+15 hours for mission preparation). Individual locations may
   increase or decrease this time depending on specific capabilities. OG/CCs may establish self-
   alert procedures for local training missions.
       3.11.1.1. For missions with more than minimum ground time, the PIC may arrange an
       alert time that provides additional preparation time to accomplish the mission. The PIC
       may also accept alerting with reduced preparation time when the mission allows. In all
       cases, the PIC shall coordinate changes to standard alerting times with the appropriate C2
       agency.
       3.11.1.2. With PIC agreement and when cargo load warrants (i.e. outsized and 1C-5A-9-
       2 or 1C-5M-9-2 cargo), C2 agents may alert loadmasters up to 2 hours before normal
       alert time. When early alerting is warranted, the PIC and C2 agent must notify the
       loadmaster before he/she enters crew rest. Do not alert the loadmaster more than 1 hour
       before beginning cargo up load. Base the aircrew FDP on the loadmaster’s show time.
       3.11.1.3. C2 agents shall not alert an aircrew until the aircraft is in commission or there
       is reasonable assurance that maintenance technicians will complete repairs that allow the
       aircrew time to pre-flight and load the aircraft to meet the target takeoff time.
       3.11.1.4. C2 agents shall not alert outbound crews when inbound aircraft is on A-2 or A-
       3 status until maintenance technicians determine required parts are available and the
       aircraft will be repaired within the target ground time.
       3.11.1.5. Self-Alerts. Crews will self-alert at locations without a C2 agency, but must
       coordinate with appropriate C2 agency. The PIC may elect to self-alert on operational
 32                                               AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


       missions at locations with a C2 agency. Coordinate the alert time with local C2 agents to
       avoid FDP limitations that result from unexpected changes in the mission.
   3.11.2. The aircrew release policy is as follows:
       3.11.2.1. On the aircrew’s initial entry or re-entry into crew rest, the controlling C2
       agent, or PIC during self-alerts, will establish an expected alert time.
       3.11.2.2. For all missions, the latest allowable alert time is 6 hours after the expected
       alert time. The PIC may extend that window to 8 hours when flying as primary crew or
       12 hours when deadheading. The controlling C2 agent will not ask the PIC to accept
       more than the 6 hour window. ANG/ AFRC aircrew members may extend the window as
       necessary to deadhead to home station to meet the Firm Scheduled Return Time (FSRT).
       3.11.2.3. When a C2 agent determines circumstances will not allow for aircrew alerting
       during the legal for alert window, at that time but not earlier than the expected alert time,
       the C2 agent will contact the PIC and establish a new expected alert time at least 12 hours
       from the time of notification.
       3.11.2.4. If the mission cannot depart within 4+00 hours of any scheduled takeoff, the
       PIC may continue the mission after a thorough re-evaluation of all ORM factors. C2
       agent will not ask the PIC to accept a takeoff outside of the 4 hour window. The PIC will
       coordinate with C2 to continue the mission or enter crew rest and establish a legal for
       alert time.
3.12. Stage Management.
   3.12.1. Stage Posture. Stages operate on a positive launch principle. C2 agents shall alert
   aircrews using the following priority/hierarchy:
       3.12.1.1. Aircrews that require an emergency return to home station.
       3.12.1.2. De-positioning stage crews will be prioritized by their SRTs.
       3.12.1.3. Aircrews in sequence of arrival time.
       3.12.1.4. If the stage manager returns an aircrew in the stage to crew rest because of a
       mission delay or abort, that aircrew becomes first out when legal for alert.
   3.12.2. Mechanical Stage. A C2 agent may create a mechanical stage when a delayed or
   aborted mission will not resume before that aircrew’s FDP expires. Aircrews in a mechanical
   stage will be first out when a mission in the same direction transits their location while they
   are legal for alert. A C2 agent may bump an inbound aircrew with FDP to complete that
   mission to cycle aircrews in a mechanical stage. C2 agents should not normally establish a
   mechanical stage for ANG and AFRC crews flying unit-equipped aircraft.
3.13. Standby Force Duty. MAJCOM C2 Agents shall task units for Standby Force Duty not
later than 18 hours prior to legal for alert time. This allows crewmembers 12 hours of pre-
standby crew rest and 6 hours for aircraft pre-flight duty. When aircrews are unable to complete
all preflight duties within 6 hours of crew show time, provide an additional 12-hour pre-standby
crew rest. If MAJCOM C2 agents are unable to provide 18 hours prior notification, SQ/CC shall
place the pre-standby crew in 12 hour crew rest and follow aircraft generation procedures in
paragraph 3.7.5 to prepare the aircraft for launch. SQ/CC may keep an aircrew in
ALFA/BRAVO status up to 48 hours. MAJCOM/A3 may extend this period for contingencies.
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                            33


After completion of an alert period, launch, release, or re-enter aircrew into 12 hour pre-
departure crew rest. OG/CCs may provide additional local procedures for management of
Standby Force Duties.
   3.13.1. ALFA Standby Aircraft Preflight Generation and Security. When tasked, SQ/CC
   shall posture an aircraft and aircrew as an ALFA Standby Force able to launch within
   1+30hours. The following procedures apply to primary aircraft as well as spare aircraft
   generated for ALFA alerts. A maintenance Dash -6 and aircrew Dash -1 preflight must be
   completed. Preflight validity will be in accordance with applicable flight manual. After the
   preflight, the PIC will notify the controlling agency. The aircraft will remain in a sealed
   posture and be referred to as “cocked on alert”. Documentation of when the aircraft was
   cocked on alert must be placed in the forms. The PIC will ensure the aircraft is secure before
   entering crew rest. Secure all hatches and doors to show unauthorized entry. The aircrew
   preflight portion remains valid if performed by one crew, cocked on alert, and launched by
   another crew. Uncocking a generated aircraft is not a standard procedure but may be
   accomplished on a case by case basis. The PIC or a designated aircrew representative must
   be present if access to the aircraft is required. Ensure command and control and the
   controlling agency are notified when uncocking and recocking generated aircraft. Follow-on
   pre-flights done during normal waking hours do not interrupt crew rest. Begin CDT/FDP
   when C2 agent directs the aircrew to launch from crew rest or while performing pre-flight
   (begin CDT/FDP when the aircrew arrived at the aircraft to do the pre-flight).
   3.13.1. (439AW) Use the ALFA standby aircraft preparation procedures contained in
   Attachment 2 for primary and spare aircraft generated for ALFA alerts.
   3.13.2. BRAVO Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture an aircraft and/or
   aircrew in BRAVO Standby Force to permit launch within 3+45 hours. Follow-on pre-
   flights, if required, interrupt crew rest. Begin CDT/FDP when aircrew shows for duty.
   3.13.3. CHARLIE Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture aircrews as a
   CHARLIE Standby Force ready to enter crew rest within 2 hours. Tasked aircrews will be
   legal for alert 12 hours after entering crew rest. SQ/CC may keep aircrews in CHARLIE
   status up to 72 hours. After 72 hours, release aircrews or enter them into 12 hours crew rest
   for directed mission, training mission, or subsequent standby force duty.
   3.13.4. Wing Standby Force. OG/CC may place aircrews in Wing Standby status. After a 12
   hour pre-departure crew rest period, aircrews are legal for alert for 12 hours and must be able
   to launch within 3+45 hours. After 12 hours, launch, release, or re-enter aircrews in 12 hour
   crew rest period before subsequent 12 hours Wing Standby duty.
   3.13.5. Post-Standby Missions. On completion of standby duty, aircrew members may be
   dispatched on a mission. If started, post-standby crew rest must be completed before the start
   of pre-departure crew rest. If an aircrew member is dispatched on a mission, compute the
   post-mission crew rest time on standby time plus mission time.
   3.13.6. Post Standby Crew Rest. Aircrew members not dispatched on a mission following
   standby duty will receive post-mission standby crew rest as follows:
      3.13.6.1. If standby duty is performed away from normal quarters, crew rest time is
      computed from this standby time on the same basis as for mission time.
 34                                               AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


       3.13.6.2. If standby duty was performed in normal quarters, no crew rest time is
       authorized.
3.14. Orientation Flights and Incentive Flights. Refer to DoD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation,
AFI 11-401, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement.
3.15. Interfly. Interfly is a temporary arrangement between OG/CCs or equivalent to permit the
exchange or substitution of aircrew members and/or aircraft between mobility units to
accomplish flying missions. Interfly will be limited to specific operations, exercises, or special
circumstances. However, it may be used for events of longer duration such as unit conversion to
another model design series (MDS). AFRC/A3 has delegated interfly approval authority to unit
OG/CCs for active duty/ANG interfly with AFRC and AFRC to AFRC interfly. Units utilizing
this authority will inform AFRC/A3V. NGB/A3 has delegated approval authority to Wing
Commanders for active duty/AFRC interfly with ANG, and OG/CC approval authority for ANG
to ANG interfly. ANG units will ensure appropriate active duty General Officer support staff has
notified the Air Force Directorate of Personnel General Officer Management Office (AF/DPG)
prior to and active duty General Officer flying with their unit. Participating aircrews will use
guidelines established by the host command or as specified in the OPLAN or CONOPS.
EXCEPTION: AE crewmembers are exempt from interfly requirements.
   3.15.1. Aircrew members shall be current and qualified in the MDS (aircraft and model), as
   well as unique systems or configuration required to fly the aircraft/mission.
   3.15.2. Each affected group commander who commits resources (personnel or aircraft) must
   concur with interfly proposal.
   3.15.3. MDS conversion training.
   3.15.4. Units may request an interfly agreement for duration of their conversion. OG/CCs
   will forward interfly requests to individual OG/CCs for approval. Requests will include as a
   minimum a list of effected units, duration of the agreement, and purpose.
3.16. Mission Essential Personnel (MEP). Procedures and policies regarding MEP are
contained in AFI 11-401 and AMCI 11-208, Tanker/Airlift Operations. PICs will ensure
personnel traveling in this status are properly authorized. Crewmembers qualified in mobility
aircraft are authorized MEP status on any mobility aircraft to pre/de-position in support of
mobility operations. MAJCOM designated crewmembers who are assigned or authorized to
accompany the normal crew compliment are allowed MEP status.
   3.16.1. Crewmembers in MEP status are not authorized to:
       3.16.1.1. Displace manifested passengers.
       3.16.1.2. Maintain currency and/or log flying time.
       3.16.1.3. Use for transportation while on leave. EXCEPTION: ANG/AFRC Air
       Technicians may be in a civilian leave status while traveling en route to perform in a
       military duty status.
       3.16.1.4. Travel on Special Air Missions/Command Support Mission (SAM/CSM)
       aircraft unless authorized by HQ AF/CVAM through the PIC.
       3.16.1.5. Travel on Special Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAM) when specifically
       restricted by the mission directive.
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                          35


       3.16.1.6. Travel on Operational Support Airlift (OSA) aircraft unless authorized by Joint
       Operational Support Airlift Command (JOSAC) through the PIC.
   3.16.2. All MEPs require valid travel/flight orders or supporting message authorizing MEP
   status. OG/CCs may authorize MEP status for their mobility aircrews.
   3.16.3. Flight evaluators have priority and will not be displaced by any other MEP. The
   priority for evaluators is MAJCOM, NAF, group, and then squadron level.
   3.16.4. MEPs normally travel in the crew compartment. If the number of MEPs desiring
   travel exceeds the capacity of the crew compartment, the C2 agency will notify the ATOC,
   who in turn will coordinate with the passenger terminal; seats not previously assigned may be
   used for MEPs.
   3.16.5. The PIC, or designated representative, will brief MEPs on seat assignment,
   appropriate mission information, emergency procedures including egress, and armed
   crewmembers. The PIC may assign an MEP aircrew-related duties for which the MEP is
   qualified.
   3.16.6. MEPs will coordinate their travel with the appropriate C2 agency prior to travel.
   They will process through the C2 agency as early as possible but NLT 3 hours prior to
   planned block time.
3.17. Mission Mobility Observers (MMO). MAJCOM supplements or additional directives
may establish programs authorizing senior military and civilian personnel to fly for mobility
mission familiarization.

                                          Chapter 4

                       AIRCRAFT OPERATING RESTRICTIONS

4.1. Objective. Redundant systems may allow crews to safely perform some missions when a
component/system is degraded. The PIC is the final authority in determining the overall
suitability of an aircraft for the mission. The PIC will ensure a detailed explanation of the
discrepancy is entered in the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document
and include the following maintenance identifiers to effectively communicate aircraft status.
   4.1.1. Mission Essential (ME). The PIC will designate an item, system, or subsystem
   component essential for safe aircraft operation as ME.
   4.1.2. Mission Contributing (MC). The PIC will designate an item, system, or subsystem
   component, which is not currently essential for safe aircraft operation as MC. These
   discrepancies should be cleared at the earliest opportunity. If circumstances change or
   mission safety would be compromised, re-designate as ME. Do not delay a mission to clear a
   MC discrepancy.
   4.1.3. Open Item (OI). The PIC will designate discrepancies not expected to adversely
   impact the current mission or any subsequent mission as an OI. These items are normally
   cleared at home station.
   4.1.4. Time Limited Dispatch (TLD) (C-5M). TLD level A faults are ME. TLD level B and
   level C are initially designated OI. Level B and level C conditions are designated ME at
   repair capable facilities when time remaining is insufficient for mission completion.
   Designate level D faults as OI. TLD limits are contained in T.O. 1C-5M-1. TLD faults that
   display a NOT ACTIVE status are still considered real faults because the condition which
   triggered the fault may not always be present.
4.2. Minimum Equipment List (MEL) Policy. The MEL is a pre-launch document that lists
the minimum equipment/systems to operate the aircraft. It is impractical to prepare a list that
would anticipate all possible combinations of equipment malfunctions and contingent
circumstances. Consider equipment/systems with no listed exceptions as grounding items. A PIC
who accepts an aircraft with degraded equipment/systems is not committed to subsequent
operations with the same degraded equipment. PICs are not committed to operations with
degraded equipment accepted by another PIC.
   4.2.1. The PIC shall account for the possibility of additional failures during continued
   operation with inoperative systems or components. The MEL is not intended for continued
   operation over an indefinite period with systems/subsystems inoperative.
   4.2.2. All emergency equipment will be installed unless specifically exempted by mission
   requirements/directives.
   4.2.3. Waiver Policy. A PIC prepared to operate with a degraded MEL item shall request a
   waiver through C2 channels. The PIC shall provide the C2 agent: 1) nature of request, 2)
   individual crew member qualification, 3) mission leg(s) requiring the waiver, 4) weather or
   other adverse condition, and 5) the governing directive of waiver request to include volume,
   chapter, or paragraph. Initiate waiver requests as soon as possible; plan at least a 1-hour
   waiver process time.
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                            37


   4.2.4. PICs operating with degraded equipment shall coordinate mission requirements (i.e.,
   revised departure times, fuel requirements, maintenance requirements, etc.) with the
   controlling C2 agency and/or flight manager.
   4.2.5. If beyond C2 communication capability, or when it is necessary to protect the crew or
   aircraft from a situation not covered by this chapter and immediate action is required, the PIC
   may deviate according to paragraph 1.4. Report deviations (without waiver) through
   channels to MAJCOM/A3/DO within 48-hours. OG/CCs shall collect background
   information and submit a follow-up written report upon request.
4.3. Waiver Protocol. Waivers to operate with degraded equipment are granted on a case-by-
case basis. The PIC determines the need for a waiver after coordinating with the lowest practical
level of command. MEL waiver authority is as follows:
4.3. (439AW)Waiver Protocol. Contact on call OGV personnel through 439 AW/CP or TACC
prior to requesting any waiver to this chapter.
   4.3.1. Training Missions. OG/CC or equivalent with mission execution authority.
   4.3.2. MAJCOM Directed Missions. MAJCOM/A3/DO with mission execution authority.
   Initiate the request with MAJCOM C2 agency.
       4.3.2.1. The 18 AF/CC is the waiver authority for active duty, AFRC, or ANG units
       flying 618 AOC (TACC) directed missions (includes Operational Readiness Inspections).
       The MEL waiver authority has been delegated to AMC/A3V. Contact AMC/A3V
       through 618 AOC (TACC).
   4.3.3. Contingency Missions. COMAFFOR (or equivalent) for the agency with C2, if not
   specified in the OPORD/Tasking Order.
   4.3.4. ANG or AFRC Directed Missions. ANG or AFRC maintains C2 and waiver authority
   for ANG or AFRC directed mission prior to mobilization. NGB/A3 delegates waiver
   authority to the unit OG/CC.
   4.3.5. Other Than MEL Waivers. Determine governing source document (i.e. AFI, Flight
   Manual, Maintenance T.O., etc.) to ascertain the waiver authority. Use C2 channels to notify
   the appropriate waiver authority. Waivers of this nature may require an extended response
   time.
   4.3.6. Engineering Dispositions (ED). Dispositions are requested when aircraft are damaged
   and/or established maintenance technical order procedures cannot be followed or do not
   exist. The on-site maintenance authority is responsible for requesting Engineering
   Dispositions. Most EDs allow maintenance to repair the aircraft and return it to unrestricted
   status; dispositions of this nature should not concern aircrews. However, EDs affecting
   aircrew operations require MEL waiver authority approval.
       4.3.6.1. PICs shall coordinate dispositions containing flight restrictions, prohibitions,
       additional operating limits, or modified/non-standard operating procedures with the
       appropriate MEL waiver authority (see paragraph 4.3).
       4.3.6.2. PICs will not accept dispositions appearing incomplete, in error, or unsafe. Prior
       to rejecting a disposition, the PIC will contact the appropriate MEL waiver authority. The
 38                                               AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


       waiver authority will attempt to resolve the issue. NOTE: Deviations from the flight
       manual requires approval IAW the flight manual.
4.4. Technical Assistance. The PIC may request technical support and additional assistance
from their home unit or MAJCOM C2 agency.
4.5. MEL Table Definitions/Column Identifiers. MEL tables are arranged by aircraft system
to provide the PIC a mechanism to determine minimum system requirements. Requirements are
defined by Column A and Column B. Column A directs systems/subsystems/components that
must be operable for the aircraft to be considered in commission at the aircraft’s home station
IAW paragraph 3.11.1.3 Column B directs systems/sub-systems/components required after start
of the aircrew inspection at home station and at bases other than the aircrafts home station. An
asterisk (*) indicates the number required is situation dependent; refer to
remarks/limitations/exceptions column for clarification.       NOTES:           (1) Local training
missions, to include off-station trainers fall under column B.      (2) A few en route locations
possess the capability to provide C-5 maintenance repairs. These stations have necessary skilled
maintenance personnel, support equipment, technical data, and parts on hand to accomplish some
major and minor repairs. Common sense and good judgment must be used by all concerned when
determining minimum equipment requirements to preclude adverse operational impact or
excessive maintenance support requirements. In those instances where lack of replacement parts
or qualified personnel would cause a mission delay, the en route location will be considered non-
repair capable and aircraft may continue operations as described in the MEL.              (3) For
Remarks/Limitations/Exceptions all C-5 home station bases shall be considered a repair capable
facility.
   4.5.1. Remarks/Limitations/Exceptions. Some technical information and procedures are
   contained in this column. This is not all-inclusive; crewmembers shall refer to the flight
   manual and other directives for procedures, techniques, limitations, etc.
       4.5.1.1. One-time Flight Clarification: A Red X discrepancy must be downgraded
       through maintenance channels prior to flight. MEL waiver may still be required. This
       condition does not preclude carrying cargo and passengers unless stipulated otherwise by
       the waiver. The priority is to move the airplane to a repair capable facility. PICs must
       coordinate with appropriate agencies to ensure repair capability exists at the destination.
       One-time flights may include en route stops only when necessary to recover the airplane.
       EXAMPLE: An airplane departs on a gear-down flight from Kuwait and requires an en
       route fuel stop (Sigonella NAS) before landing at the nearest repair capable facility, Rota
       NAS.
           4.5.1.1.1. One-time flight to nearest repair capable facility: Flight is limited to the
           nearest (shortest en route time) repair capable base. NOTE: May not depart home
           station for a local training sortie/mission; the aircraft is already at a repair capable
           facility.
           4.5.1.1.2. One-time flight to a repair capable facility: Flight is not restricted to the
           nearest repair capable facility. NOTE: May not depart home station for a local
           training sortie/mission; the aircraft is already at a repair capable facility.

               4.5.1.2.1. Shall be repaired at next repair capable facility: Mission may continue as
               scheduled, item shall be repaired upon reaching a repair capable facility. Designate
               item ME upon reaching repair facility. Once maintenance action is initiated, and it is
               determined repairs are not possible, the PIC will discuss possible courses of action
               with C2 agency to return aircraft to service.
               4.5.1.2.2. Mission dictates requirement: PIC shall consider the entire mission profile,
               not just the next leg. EXAMPLE: An airplane is departing an en route station with
               repair capability, after engine start the FE discovers the #1 engine anti-ice is
               inoperative. Icing conditions are not forecasted for the next leg. However, because the
               mission spans several days and repair capability does not exist at the scheduled en
               route stops, the PIC elects to have the item repaired prior to departing.
4.6. C-5 MEL. This MEL applies to all C-5 models and lists the minimum equipment and
systems to launch the aircraft under routine operations. Tables may contain single items and
procedures that are not applicable to a specific model or modification. When an item is not
applicable to all models the remarks section is annotated with this information. Additionally,
tables that do not apply to AMP and/or C-5M modified aircraft are denoted as such in the title
and will reference the user to the appropriate table. The MEL does not include all equipment or
systems essential to airworthiness. See this chapter for further information including objectives,
policy, and waiver protocol.
4.7. Supplements. Each MAJCOM may supplement the MEL (see Chapter 1).

4.9. Landing Gear.
   4.9.1. Gear Down Flight Operations. Limit gear down flight operations to sorties required to
   move the aircraft to the nearest repair capable facility. Consider gear down flight only after
   the PIC exhausts all avenues to repair the aircraft in place.
      4.9.1.1. Standard climb-out flight path charts in T.O. 1C-5-1-1 do not account for a gear-
      down configuration. Therefore, PICs shall not takeoff until there is reasonable assurance
      that they will achieve/maintain adequate obstacle clearance (to include en route stops and
      alternates). Non-SDP procedures will be used for departure planning.
      4.9.1.2. AMC/A3V waiver approval is not required for gear down flights. However,
      aircrew will consider potential aircraft and flight considerations, take off and landing data
      (TOLD) calculations, along with proper aircraft documentation prior to known gear down
      flights. If the airplane is on a red X for a gear malfunction the airplane home station
      MXG/CC must downgrade the red X per T.O. 00-20-1 prior to flight.
      4.9.1.3. Local Training Missions. Local missions will not be planned gear down. When
      in-flight malfunctions prohibit gear retraction (except MLG rotational malfunctions), the
      local may continue after the cause of malfunction has been identified and the AC and
      maintenance supervisor concur. Do not exceed 200 KCAS/M.60.
      4.9.1.4. Gear Down Flight Procedures.
          4.9.1.4.1. Refer to Variant Configuration Fuel Planning, chapter 14.5.5, for Gear
          Down Flight fuel planning.
          4.9.1.4.2. Plan to not exceed 200 KCAS/M.60 to help prevent APU servicing door
          and gear door damage. When range is a factor, fly an airspeed that yields the
          maximum range; do not exceed 250 KCAS/M.60. EXCEPTION: Tactical
          departures will not exceed 250 KCAS.

           4.9.1.4.3. For planned gear down flight, the affected gear shall be pinned. The APU
           servicing door panel will be speed taped upon completion of the aircrew inspection
           and prior to flight. Taping may help prevent loss of the door panel. Only the door
           panel on the appropriate side requires speed tape.
           4.9.1.4.4. After each gear down flight segment conduct a visual inspection. The
           MLG inspection will include affected gear-well area, LN2 servicing panel (if
           applicable), and doors. NLG inspection will include gear-well area, doors, folding
           bulkhead door, actuators, and brackets. This inspection may be accomplished by the
           flight engineer.
   4.9.2. Operation with partial brakes. Limit operations with partial brakes only when
   necessary to recover the aircraft to a station that has confirmed repair capability. Any
   operations requiring more than one leg shall be coordinated with an AMC/A3V waiver.

      opposite indicator shall be operative. Do not air refuel with more than one inoperative
      fuel quantity indicator per wing.
      4.11.3.3. Local Missions. Do not conduct aerial refueling with an inoperative indicator
      until maintenance action has been performed (refer to paragraph 4.11.2.2).
      4.11.3.4. Not used.
      4.11.3.5. Servicing. During aerial refueling, fuel is placed in tanks with operative
      indicators first. Tanks with inoperative indicators should be serviced internally by
      transferring a known quantity from another tank.
      4.11.3.6. Unless Section 5 of the flight manual, Maximum Allowable Fuel Differential
      limits are going to be exceeded, do not accomplish internal servicing until termination of

       refueling. However; if necessary, internal servicing may be accomplished in the
       precontact position.
       4.11.3.7. When a main tank indicator is inoperative and total main tank fuel quantity is
       less than 30,000 pounds, simultaneously fill all main tanks prior to servicing other tanks
       using the following procedures:
       4.11.3.8. Position the AUTO REF switch to MAN for transfer. Monitor symmetrically
       opposite indicator to judge quantity in tank with inoperative indicator.
       4.11.3.9. After filling the main tanks, disconnect and obtain an off-load report to verify
       the quantity of fuel in the tank with the inoperative indicator. Aerial refueling may
       continue after confirming main tank fuel quantity. Further servicing of a tank with an
       inoperative indicator should be made using known quantities from internal sources.
       4.11.3.10. If a fuel imbalance is suspected (heavy wing or excessive aileron trim
       requirements), terminate aerial refueling and obtain an off-load report. Prior to internal
       fuel transfer, verify quantity of fuel in tanks with inoperative indicators. Refueling may
       be continued after fuel is balanced.

4.12. MADAR operational procedures.
   4.12.1. Both Engine Vibration Indicating (EVI) channels indicating vibration (fan or core)
   out of limits will require confirmation of engine condition by ground test equipment.
   MADARS may be used for confirmation of engine condition if ground test equipment is not
   available.
   4.12.2. One EVI channel indicating vibration (fan or core) out of limits and the other
   channel inoperative will require confirmation of engine condition by ground test equipment.
   MADARS may be used for confirmation of engine condition if ground test equipment is not
   available.
   4.12.3. One usable EVI channel indicating a vibration (fan or core) out of limits and one
   usable EVI channel indicating within limits suggest an indicating system malfunction. To
   determine if an indication malfunction exists apply the following:
       4.12.3.1. If channel 08 mil value is more than 2.5 times greater than the channel 09 mil
       value or the channel 09 value is more than 1.1 times greater than the channel 08 value, an
       indicating system malfunction exists.

4.13. FSS Servicing.
   4.13.1. Because of the increased safety margin provided by the FSS, obtain full LN2
   servicing at stations with servicing capability. NOTE: Fully serviced is defined as 650
   pounds per operational dewar to allow for gauge inaccuracies, automatic shutoff settings, and
   LN2 boil-off.
   4.13.2. Home Station Departures. The airplane will be fully serviced.
   4.13.3. En Route Stations WITH Servicing Capability. The airplane will be fully serviced
   unless directed otherwise by the PIC. EXCEPTION: Station supply depleted or equipment
   malfunctions (all servicing trucks inoperative).
       4.13.3.1. PIC should pass less than full LN2 requirements for next mission leg during
       maintenance debrief.
   4.13.4. En route Stations WITHOUT Servicing Capability. The mission may continue
   regardless of the amount of LN2 on board. If the remaining LN2 will be depleted prior to the
   next en route stop, vent wings to retain a fire fighting reserve. Do not vent wings until just
   prior to descent; make an AFTO Form 781information entry.
   4.13.5. Local Missions. Not less than that required for the planned mission duration (plus an
   adequate fire fighting reserve). For ERCCs, airplanes will be fully serviced for the first half
   to ensure the second half will have adequate LN2.
   4.13.6. General Requirements.
       4.13.6.1. Flight is not permitted with system LN2 (liquid nitrogen) leaks in excess of 50
       pounds per dewar per 12 hours. Allow 1 hour after servicing for system stabilization prior
       to start of leak check.
       4.13.6.2. Use the following values to calculate the minimum amount of LN2 required by
       paragraphs 4.13.3.1 and 4.13.5 These values are guides; amounts used may vary.
       Document significant variations in AFTO Form 781. Two hundred fifty (250) pounds
       required for firefighting (adequate for one application to the largest zone) plus:
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                               85


       4.13.6.3. Twelve pounds for every 1,000-feet of descent planned during a line or AAR
       mission.
EXAMPLE: An AAR mission that requires an 8,000-foot descent from initial level off altitude to
rendezvous altitude, followed by a final cruise altitude of FL370 will need 540 pounds of LN2.
(8,000 + 37,000 = 45,000 feet of total descent x 12 = 540 pounds).
       4.13.6.4. One hundred twenty (120) pounds will be used for each hour of local transition
       flying.
   4.13.7. Missions expecting to transit a threat environment
       4.13.7.1. If nitrogen servicing is not available at the last stop prior to entering the threat
       environment, FE’s will adhere to the following.
       4.13.7.2. NON-THREAT ENVIRONMENT LEGS. After departing the last station with
       servicing capability, vent the wings prior to each descent. Enter an information note in
       the AFTO FORM 781A each time the wings are vented.
       4.13.7.3. THREAT ENVIRONMENT LEGS. Regardless of the nitrogen quantity, do not
       vent wings on legs into and within threat locations.
       4.13.7.4. Nitrogen is not required to fly in a threat environment. If nitrogen is not
       available, do not delay the mission.

4.14. Landing Gear.
   4.14.1. Gear Down Flight Operations. Limit gear down flight operations to sorties required
   to move the aircraft to the nearest repair capable facility. Consider gear down flight only after
   the PIC exhausts all avenues to repair the aircraft in place.
       4.14.1.1. Standard climb-out flight path charts in T.O. 1C-5A-1-1 do not account for a
       gear-down configuration. Therefore, PICs shall not takeoff until there is reasonable

       assurance that they will achieve/maintain adequate obstacle clearance (to include en route
       stops and alternates). Non-SDP procedures will be used for departure planning.
       4.14.1.2. AMC/A3V waiver approval is not required for gear down flights. However,
       aircrew will consider potential aircraft and flight considerations, take off and landing data
       (TOLD) calculations, along with proper aircraft documentation prior to known gear down
       flights. If the airplane is on a red X for a gear malfunction the airplane home station
       MXG/CC must downgrade the red X per T.O. 00-20-1 prior to flight.
       4.14.1.3. Local Training Missions. Local missions will not be planned gear down. When
       in-flight malfunctions prohibit gear retraction (except MLG rotational malfunctions), the
       local may continue after the cause of malfunction has been identified and the AC and
       maintenance supervisor concur. Do not exceed 200 KCAS/M.60.
       4.14.1.4. Gear Down Flight Procedures.
           4.14.1.4.1. Refer to Variant Configuration Fuel Planning, chapter 14.5.5, for Gear
           Down Flight fuel planning.
           4.14.1.4.2. Plan to not exceed 200 KCAS/M.60 to help prevent APU servicing door
           and gear door damage. When range is a factor, fly an airspeed that yields the
           maximum range; do not exceed 250 KCAS/M.60. EXCEPTION: Tactical departures
           will not exceed 250 KCAS.
           4.14.1.4.3. For planned gear down flight, the affected gear shall be pinned. The APU
           servicing door panel will be speed taped upon completion of the aircrew inspection
           and prior to flight. Taping may help prevent loss of the door panel. Only the door
           panel on the appropriate side requires speed tape.
           4.14.1.4.4. After each gear down flight segment conduct a visual inspection. The
           MLG inspection will include affected gear-well area, LN2 servicing panel (if
           applicable), and doors. NLG inspection will include gear-well area, doors, folding
           bulkhead door, actuators, and brackets. This inspection may be accomplished by the
           flight engineer.
   4.14.2. Operation with partial brakes. Limit operations with partial brakes only when
   necessary to recover the aircraft to a station that has confirmed repair capability. Any
   operations requiring more than one leg shall be coordinated with an AMC/A3V waiver.

required to move the aircraft to the nearest repair capable facility. Slats retracted flight should
only be considered after reasonable efforts to repair the aircraft have been attempted. AMC/A3V
waiver approval is not required provided the airplane is being flown (slats retracted with flap
system operational) to the nearest repair capable facility. If the airplane is on a red X for a slat
malfunction the airplane home station MXG/CC must downgrade the red X per T.O. 00-20-1
prior to flight.

4.16. Fuel System. It is preferred to use standard fuel system management to the maximum
extent possible. Comply with Sections 2 and 5 of the flight manual if non-standard fuel
sequencing is required for a one time flight to the nearest repair capable facility.
   4.16.1. For Ground Refueling Procedures with Inoperative Fuel Quantity Indicator, refer to
   Paragraph 12.15
   4.16.2. Fuel Quantity Indicator Failure In Flight.
       4.16.2.1. Line Missions. Comply with Section 3 of the flight manual. Continue as
       scheduled provided Item 25-24 Remarks/Limitations/Exceptions are met and the
       destination has capability to safe affected tank IAW maintenance technical orders.
       4.16.2.2. Local Missions. Comply with Section 3 of the flight manual and land as soon
       as practical. Flight may resume provided Item 25-24 Remarks/Limitations/Exceptions are
       met, maintenance personnel determined the nature of the malfunction, and the tank has
       been made safe IAW maintenance technical orders.
   4.16.3. Aerial Refueling Missions.
       4.16.3.1. Line Missions. Comply with Section 3of the flight manual. Symmetrically
       opposite indicator shall be operative. Do not air refuel with more than one inoperative
       fuel quantity indicator per wing.
       4.16.3.2. Local Missions. Do not conduct aerial refueling with an inoperative indicator
       until maintenance action has been performed (see Paragraph 4.16.2.2).
       4.16.3.3. Servicing. During aerial refueling, fuel is placed in tanks with operative
       indicators first. Tanks with inoperative indicators should be serviced internally by
       transferring a known quantity from another tank.

       4.16.3.4. Unless Section 5 of the flight manual, Maximum Allowable Fuel Differential
       limits are going to be exceeded, do not accomplish internal servicing until termination of
       refueling. However; if necessary, internal servicing may be accomplished in the
       precontact position.
       4.16.3.5. When a main tank indicator is inoperative and total main tank fuel quantity is
       less than 30,000 pounds, simultaneously fill all main tanks prior to servicing other tanks
       using the following procedures:
       4.16.3.6. Position the AUTO REF switch to MAN for transfer. Monitor symmetrically
       opposite indicator to judge quantity in tank with inoperative indicator.
       4.16.3.7. After filling the main tanks, disconnect and obtain an off-load report to verify
       the quantity of fuel in the tank with the inoperative indicator. Aerial refueling may
       continue after confirming main tank fuel quantity. Further servicing of a tank with an
       inoperative indicator should be made using known quantities from internal sources.
       4.16.3.8. If a fuel imbalance is suspected (heavy wing or excessive aileron trim
       requirements), terminate aerial refueling and obtain an off-load report. Prior to internal
       fuel transfer, verify quantity of fuel in tanks with inoperative indicators. Refueling may
       be continued after fuel is balanced.

4.17. MADAR operational procedures.
   4.17.1. Both Engine Vibration Indicating (EVI) channels indicating vibration (fan or core)
   out of limits will require confirmation of engine condition by ground test equipment.
   MADARS may be used for confirmation of engine condition if ground test equipment is not
   available.
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                         127


   4.17.2. One EVI channel indicating vibration (fan or core) out of limits and the other
   channel inoperative will require confirmation of engine condition by ground test equipment.
   MADARS may be used for confirmation of engine condition if ground test equipment is not
   available.
   4.17.3. One usable EVI channel indicating a vibration (fan or core) out of limits and one
   usable EVI channel indicating within limits suggest an indicating system malfunction. To
   determine if an indication malfunction exists apply the following:
      4.17.3.1. If channel 08 mil value is more than 2.5 times greater than the channel 09 mil
      value or the channel 09 value is more than 1.1 times greater than the channel 08 value, an
      indicating system malfunction exists.

4.18. FSS Servicing.
   4.18.1. Because of the increased safety margin provided by the FSS, obtain full LN2
   servicing at stations with servicing capability. NOTE: Fully serviced is defined as 650
   pounds per operational dewar to allow for gauge inaccuracies, automatic shutoff settings, and
   LN2 boil-off.
   4.18.2. Home Station Departures. The airplane will be fully serviced.
   4.18.3. En Route Stations WITH Servicing Capability. The airplane will be fully serviced
   unless directed otherwise by the PIC. EXCEPTION: Station supply depleted or equipment
   malfunctions (all servicing trucks inoperative).
      4.18.3.1. PIC should pass less than full LN2 requirements for next mission leg during
      maintenance debrief.
   4.18.4. En route Stations WITHOUT Servicing Capability. The mission may continue
   regardless of the amount of LN2 on board. If the remaining LN2 will be depleted prior to the
   next en route stop, vent wings to retain a fire fighting reserve. Do not vent wings until just
   prior to descent; make an AFTO Form 781information entry.
   4.18.5. Local Missions. Not less than that required for the planned mission duration (plus an
   adequate fire fighting reserve). For ERCCs, airplanes will be fully serviced for the first half
   to ensure the second half will have adequate LN2.
   4.18.6. General Requirements.
      4.18.6.1. Flight is not permitted with system LN2 (liquid nitrogen) leaks in excess of 50
      pounds per dewar per 12 hours. Allow 1 hour after servicing for system stabilization prior
      to start of leak check.
      4.18.6.2. Use the following values to calculate the minimum amount of LN2 required by
      paragraphs 4.18.3.1 and 4.18.5 These values are guides; amounts used may vary.
      Document significant variations in AFTO Form 781. Two hundred fifty (250) pounds
      required for firefighting (adequate for one application to the largest zone) plus:
      4.18.6.3. Twelve pounds for every 1,000-feet of descent planned during a line or AAR
      mission. EXAMPLE: An AAR mission that requires an 8,000-foot descent from initial
      level off altitude to rendezvous altitude, followed by a final cruise altitude of FL370 will
      need 540 pounds of LN2. (8,000 + 37,000 = 45,000 feet of total descent x 12 = 540
      pounds).
      4.18.6.4. One hundred twenty (120) pounds will be used for each hour of local transition
      flying.
   4.18.7. Missions expecting to transit a threat environment
      4.18.7.1. If nitrogen servicing is not available at the last stop prior to entering the threat
      environment, FE’s will adhere to the following.
      4.18.7.2. NON-THREAT ENVIRONMENT LEGS. After departing the last station with
      servicing capability, vent the wings prior to each descent. Enter an information note in
      the AFTO FORM 781A each time the wings are vented.

       4.18.7.3. THREAT ENVIRONMENT LEGS. Regardless of the nitrogen quantity, do not
       vent wings on legs into and within threat locations.
       4.18.7.4. Nitrogen is not required to fly in a threat environment. If nitrogen is not
       available, do not delay the mission.

4.19. Landing Gear.
   4.19.1. Gear Down Flight Operations. Limit gear down flight operations to sorties required
   to move the aircraft to the nearest repair capable facility. Consider gear down flight only after
   the PIC exhausts all avenues to repair the aircraft in place.
       4.19.1.1. Standard climb-out flight path charts in T.O. 1C-5M-1-1 do not account for a
       gear-down configuration. Therefore, PICs shall not takeoff until there is reasonable
       assurance that they will achieve/maintain adequate obstacle clearance (to include en route
       stops and alternates).
       4.19.1.2. AMC/A3V waiver approval is not required for gear down flights. However,
       aircrew will consider potential aircraft and flight considerations, take off and landing data
       (TOLD) calculations, along with proper aircraft documentation prior to known gear down
       flights. If the airplane is on a red X for a gear malfunction the airplane home station
       MXG/CC must downgrade the red X per T.O. 00-20-1 prior to flight.
       4.19.1.3. Local Training Missions. Local missions will not be planned gear down. When
       in-flight malfunctions prohibit gear retraction (except MLG rotational malfunctions), the
       local may continue after the cause of malfunction has been identified and the AC and
       maintenance supervisor concur. Do not exceed 200 KCAS/M.60.
       4.19.1.4. Gear Down Flight Procedures.
          4.19.1.4.1. Refer to Variant Configuration Fuel Planning, chapter 14.5.5, for Gear
          Down Flight fuel planning.
          4.19.1.4.2. Plan to not exceed 200 KCAS/M.60 to help prevent APU servicing door
          and gear door damage. When range is a factor, fly an airspeed that yields the
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                          155


           maximum range; do not exceed 250 KCAS/M.60. EXCEPTION: Tactical departures
           will not exceed 250 KCAS.
           4.19.1.4.3. For planned gear down flight, the affected gear shall be pinned. The APU
           servicing door panel will be speed taped upon completion of the aircrew inspection
           and prior to flight. Taping may help prevent loss of the door panel. Only the door
           panel on the appropriate side requires speed tape.
           4.19.1.4.4. After each gear down flight segment conduct a visual inspection. The
           MLG inspection will include affected gear-well area, LN2 servicing panel (if
           applicable), and doors. NLG inspection will include gear-well area, doors, folding
           bulkhead door, actuators, and brackets. This inspection may be accomplished by the
           flight engineer.
   4.19.2. Operation with partial brakes. Limit operations with partial brakes only when
   necessary to recover the aircraft to a station that has confirmed repair capability. Any
   operations requiring more than one leg shall be coordinated with an AMC/A3V waiver.

4.20. SLATS INOPERATIVE. Slats retracted flight operations will be limited to those sorties
required to move the aircraft to the nearest repair capable facility. Slats retracted flight should
only be considered after reasonable efforts to repair the aircraft have been attempted. AMC/A3V
waiver approval is not required provided the airplane is being flown (slats retracted with flap
system operational) to the nearest repair capable facility. If the airplane is on a red X for a slat
malfunction the airplane home station MXG/CC must downgrade the red X per T.O. 00-20-1
prior to flight.

4.21. Fuel System. It is preferred to use standard fuel system management to the maximum
extent possible. Comply with Sections 2 and 5 of the flight manual if non-standard fuel
sequencing is required for a one time flight to the nearest repair capable facility.
   4.21.1. For Ground Refueling Procedures with Inoperative Fuel Quantity Indicator, refer to
   Paragraph 12.15
   4.21.2. Fuel Quantity Indicator Failure In Flight.
      4.21.2.1. Line Missions. Comply with Section 3 of the flight manual. Continue as
      scheduled provided.       Item 44-24 Remarks/Limitations/Exceptions are met and the
      destination has capability to safe affected tank IAW maintenance technical orders.
      4.21.2.2. Local Missions. Comply with Section 3 of the flight manual and land as soon
      as practical. Flight may resume provided Item 44-21 Remarks/Limitations/Exceptions are
      met, maintenance personnel determined the nature of the malfunction, and the tank has
      been made safe IAW maintenance technical orders.
   4.21.3. Aerial Refueling Missions.
      4.21.3.1. Line Missions. Comply with Section 3 of the flight manual. Symmetrically
      opposite indicator shall be operative. Do not air refuel with more than one inoperative
      fuel quantity indicator per wing.
      4.21.3.2. Local Missions. Do not conduct aerial refueling with an inoperative indicator
      until maintenance action has been performed (see Paragraph 4.21.2.2).
      4.21.3.3. Servicing. During aerial refueling, fuel is placed in tanks with operative
      indicators first. Tanks with inoperative indicators should be serviced internally by
      transferring a known quantity from another tank.
      4.21.3.4. Unless Section 5 of the flight manual, Maximum Allowable Fuel Differential
      limits are going to be exceeded, do not accomplish internal servicing until termination of
      refueling. However; if necessary, internal servicing may be accomplished in the
      precontact position.

       4.21.3.5. When a main tank indicator is inoperative and total main tank fuel quantity is
       less than 30,000 pounds, simultaneously fill all main tanks prior to servicing other tanks
       using the following procedures:
       4.21.3.6. Position the AUTO REF switch to MAN for transfer. Monitor symmetrically
       opposite indicator to judge quantity in tank with inoperative indicator.
       4.21.3.7. After filling the main tanks, disconnect and obtain an off-load report to verify
       the quantity of fuel in the tank with the inoperative indicator. Aerial refueling may
       continue after confirming main tank fuel quantity. Further servicing of a tank with an
       inoperative indicator should be made using known quantities from internal sources.
       4.21.3.8. If a fuel imbalance is suspected (heavy wing or excessive aileron trim
       requirements), terminate aerial refueling and obtain an off-load report. Prior to internal
       fuel transfer, verify quantity of fuel in tanks with inoperative indicators. Refueling may
       be continued after fuel is balanced.

4.22. FSS Servicing.
   4.22.1. Because of the increased safety margin provided by the FSS, obtain full LN2
   servicing at stations with servicing capability. NOTE: Fully serviced is defined as 650
   pounds per operational dewar to allow for gauge inaccuracies, automatic shutoff settings, and
   LN2 boil-off.
   4.22.2. Home Station Departures. The airplane will be fully serviced.
   4.22.3. En Route Stations WITH Servicing Capability. The airplane will be fully serviced
   unless directed otherwise by the PIC. EXCEPTION: Station supply depleted or equipment
   malfunctions (all servicing trucks inoperative).
       4.22.3.1. PIC should pass less than full LN2 requirements for next mission leg during
       maintenance debrief.
   4.22.4. En route Stations WITHOUT Servicing Capability. The mission may be continued
   regardless of the amount of LN2 on board. If the remaining LN2 will be depleted prior to the
   next en route stop, vent wings to retain a fire fighting reserve. Do not vent wings until just
   prior to descent; make an AFTO Form 781information entry.
   4.22.5. Local Missions. Not less than that required for the planned mission duration (plus an
   adequate fire fighting reserve). For ERCCs, airplanes will be fully serviced for the first half
   to ensure the second half will have adequate LN2.
   4.22.6. General Requirements.
       4.22.6.1. Flight is not permitted with system LN2 (liquid nitrogen) leaks in excess of 50
       pounds per dewar per 12 hours. Allow 1 hour after servicing for system stabilization prior
       to start of leak check. Flight may be permitted if the leaking dewar is drained (refer to
       Item 53-1).
       4.22.6.2. Use the following values to calculate the minimum amount of LN2 required by
       paragraphs 4.22.3.1 and 4.22.5 These values are guides; amounts used may vary.
       Document significant variations in AFTO Form 781. Two hundred fifty (250) pounds
       required for firefighting (adequate for one application to the largest zone) plus:
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                              181


       4.22.6.3. Twelve pounds for every 1,000-feet of descent planned during a line or AAR
       mission. EXAMPLE: An AAR mission that requires an 8,000-foot descent from initial
       level off altitude to rendezvous altitude, followed by a final cruise altitude of FL370 will
       need 540 pounds of LN2. (8,000 + 37,000 = 45,000 feet of total descent x 12 = 540
       pounds).
       4.22.6.4. One hundred twenty (120) pounds will be used for each hour of local transition
       flying.
   4.22.7. Missions expecting to transit a threat environment
       4.22.7.1. If nitrogen servicing is not available at the last stop prior to entering the threat
       environment, FE’s will adhere to the following.
       4.22.7.2. NON-THREAT ENVIRONMENT LEGS. After departing the last station with
       servicing capability, vent the wings prior to each descent. Enter an information note in
       the AFTO FORM 781A each time the wings are vented.
       4.22.7.3. THREAT ENVIRONMENT LEGS. Regardless of the nitrogen quantity, do not
       vent wings on legs into and within threat locations.
       4.22.7.4. Nitrogen is not required to fly in a threat environment. If nitrogen is not
       available, do not delay the mission.

                               OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

5.1. Checklists. A checklist is not complete until all items have been accomplished. Momentary
hesitations for coordination items, ATC interruptions and deviations specified in the flight
manual, etc., are authorized. Notes amplifying checklist procedures or limitations may be added
to the checklists. Currency of notes is a crewmember’s responsibility.
   5.1.1. Checklist Inserts. MAJCOM/A3V and the AFMC Flight Manual Manager are the
   checklist insert approval authorities. Send checklist inserts to MAJCOM/A3V, who will in
   turn coordinate with AFMC for approval. All checklist inserts must have a POC. OGVs shall
   approve local in-flight guides and inserts not affecting flight manual guidance and
   procedures.
   5.1.2. Abbreviated checklists items that do not apply to the unit’s aircraft or mission may be
   lined out.
   5.1.3. Emergency checklists. Either pilot may be required to accomplish an emergency
   checklist from either seat. The pilot accomplishing the checklist must ensure compliance
   with all checklist items regardless of which crew position (PF, PM, P, CP) is designated to
   respond.
5.2. Duty Station. Both pilots and flight engineer shall be in their seats during flight. One of
them may be out of their seat for brief periods to meet physiological needs. With both pilots in
their seats, PICs may authorize rest periods for one pilot occupying a primary duty station during
non-critical phases of flight (the other pilot will be awake and alert). When additional aircrew
personnel are on board, the observer’s seat should be occupied, preferably by a C-5 qualified
pilot if available, to assist the crew in avoiding other aircraft during ground operations, takeoffs,
departures, penetrations, approaches and landings. Crewmembers will notify the pilot prior to
departing assigned primary duty stations.
5.3. Flight Station Entry. PICs may authorize passengers and observers access to the flight
station during all phases of flight; the total number of persons permitted is limited to the number
of seats with operable seat belts and oxygen. Passengers and observers will not be permitted
access to primary crew positions.
5.4. Takeoff and Landing Policy. An aircraft commander, or above, will occupy either the left
or the right seat during all takeoffs and landings. The designated PIC (A-code) is not required to
occupy a primary position, but still retains overall authority for conduct of the mission.
   5.4.1. An AC or IP will make all takeoffs and landings during:
       5.4.1.1. Aircraft emergencies, unless conditions prevent compliance.
       5.4.1.2. Airlift of nuclear weapons.
       5.4.1.3. Category II ILS approaches and landings when the weather is below Category I
       minimums.
       5.4.1.4. Substandard airfield operations.

   5.4.2. Unless the other pilot in the seat is a certified AC or higher, pilots in command (PIC)
   with less than 100 primary assigned aircraft (PAA) hours since AC certification will make all
   takeoffs and landings under any of the following conditions:
       5.4.2.1. Ceiling/visibility less than 300 feet and/or RVR 40 (3/4 SM visibility).
       5.4.2.2. RCR less than 12.
       5.4.2.3. Crosswind component greater than 15 knots.
5.5. Landing Gear and Flap Operating Policy. The pilot flying (PF) will command
configuration changes. The pilot monitoring (PM) will verify appropriate airspeed and
configuration prior to echoing the gear or flap actuation command. All gear operation will be
activated by the pilot in the right seat and all flap operation will be activated by the PNF.
EXCEPTION: During touch-and-go landings the IP/EP may activate the flaps as PF.
5.6. Outside Observer/Jump Seat Duties. Available crewmembers will assist in clearing
during taxi operations, receiver air to air refueling (AAR), and any time the aircraft is below
10,000 feet MSL.
   5.6.1. (Added-439AW) The jump seat should be occupied when below 10,000 feet MSL. If
   the scanner is utilized in this position, the After Take-off Climb scan should be delayed until
   passing through 10,000 feet MSL.
5.7. Seat Belts.
   5.7.1. All occupants will have a designated seat with a seat belt (unless authorized by the
   PIC). Crewmembers will have seat belts fastened when occupying a duty position, unless
   crew duties dictate otherwise.
   5.7.2. Crewmembers performing instructor or flight examiner duties are exempt from seat
   belt requirements if not occupying a primary crew position; however, they will have a seat
   available with an operable seat belt.
   5.7.3. Litter patients, actual or simulated, must remain secured on litters for takeoff and
   landing.
5.8. Aircraft Lighting. IAW AFI 11-202V3, AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement
on the Ground, and applicable T.O.s.
5.9. Portable Electronic Devices. IAW AFI 11-202V3.
   5.9.1. Do not connect unauthorized equipment (laptop computers, video equipment, food
   preparation equipment, radios/tape players, CD players, etc.) to the aircraft intercom, PA,
   radio systems, or electrical system. Approved vacuum cleaners are authorized for ground use.
   5.9.2. Aircrew members shall not use uncertified Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)
   or personal devices with RF transmit/receive capability on AMC aircraft carrying hazard
   class 1 explosive cargo at anytime. Prohibited devices include cellular phones, and laptop
   computers/PDAs with wireless capability enabled (i.e. Bluetooth). Loadmasters will ensure
   passengers comply with this restriction. Aircrew members may use certified GFE such as
   PFPS laptops and PDAs with infrared transmitters.

   5.9.3. The following handheld (HH) GPS units meet the requirements of AFI 11-202v3 and
   may be used with approved laptop computers in flight: Bendix King KLX100 and Garmin
   GPS 35-USB.
       5.9.3.1. The use of HH GPS for moving map display (MMD) is designed as a situational
       awareness tool and its use is voluntary.
   5.9.4. (Added-439AW) Crewmembers will not use audio devices, personal computers,
   gaming devices, etc. while performing primary crew duties at their duty station. Exception:
   Aft Flight Deck Loadmasters may use this equipment once cleared off of interphone by the
   aircraft commander unless performing passenger monitoring duties.
5.10. Tobacco Use on Air Force Aircraft. Tobacco use of any type is prohibited on Air Force
aircraft.
5.11. Advisory Calls. The PF will announce intentions for departures, arrivals, approaches, and
when circumstances require deviating from normal procedures. The PM will make all advisory
calls except those designated for other crewmembers. NOTE: Automated aircraft advisory calls
satisfy this requirement. Mandatory calls are as follows:
   5.11.1. During climb out and descent the PF will call departing X altitude for Y altitude
   when initiating altitude changes.
   5.11.2. Deviations.
       5.11.2.1. Any crewmember will immediately notify the PF when deviation of heading
       (+/- 10 degrees), airspeed (+/-10 kts), or altitude (+/- 100 feet) is observed and no attempt
       is being made to correct the deviation.
       5.11.2.2. Any crewmember seeing a potential terrain or obstruction problem will
       immediately notify the PF.
   5.11.3. Advisory calls: Refer to Table 5.1 through Table 5.4 for a listing of mandatory
   advisory calls, responses, and aircrew actions.

(1) With weather at CAT I minimums on a CAT I ILS, the pilot may not see the runway
environment at DA; however, the initial portion of the approach lights may be visible. The pilot
may continue to 100 HAT with reference to the approach lights only. The pilot may not descend
below 100 feet above touchdown zone elevation using the approach lights as reference unless the
red terminating bars or the red side row bars are distinctly visible and identifiable.
(2) The PF will announce his/her intentions to either land, continue (CAT I), or go-around.
Respond with the intention to land if runway environment is in sight, will remain in sight
throughout touchdown and the aircraft is in a position for a safe landing.
(3) If the pilot flying has stated “landing” then this call is not required.
(4) Refer to stabilized approach criteria in paragraph 5.12.
5.12. Stabilized Approach. Unstable approaches are primary contributors to numerous military
and civilian mishaps. Stabilized approaches are essential for the safe operation of aircraft and
are mandatory. The following criteria define specific parameters that mitigate risk during this
critical phase of flight. This philosophy requires aircrew to take immediate corrective actions to
stabilize the approach when outside designated parameters.
    5.12.1. The following criteria apply to all approaches:
        5.12.1.1. At 1000 feet AGL:
            5.12.1.1.1. Aircraft is in approach configuration. Circling configuration is acceptable
            for circling approaches.
            5.12.1.1.2. Airspeed is appropriate for the configuration and conditions.
            5.12.1.1.3. Sink rate is no greater than 1000fpm. NOTE: Under certain conditions
            (WX, Threats, Terrain, etc.) some IAPs and Tactical Approaches may require greater
            than a 1000 fpm descent rate.
                5.12.1.1.3.1. Non-precision Approaches. Pilots should calculate a constant
                descent gradient profile from the FAF altitude to the VDP (IAW AFMAN 11-
                217V1). This is considered the safest profile and should be used to the max
                extent possible. During a go-around, ensure descent below the MDA does not
                occur.
            5.12.1.1.4. All briefings and checklists are complete unless contrary to T.O.
            guidance.
            5.12.1.1.5. Aircraft is on the correct track.
            5.12.1.1.6. Aircraft in the correct bank angle to maintain proper approach track for
            instrument, circling, or visual/tactical approach.
            5.12.1.1.7. Power set to maintain the descent profile at approach speed.
            5.12.1.1.8. If these criteria are not met by 1000 feet AGL, the PM will announce the
            deviation and the PF will take immediate corrective action. PM states “1000 xxxx,”
            where “xxxx” equates to a concise description of the unstable characteristic(s) which
            clearly relay to the PF what actions are required to return the aircraft to a stable
            platform. Examples: “1000, fast,” or “1000, half dot low”. If criteria are met, PM
            will simply state “1000.”
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                               191


       5.12.1.2. From 500 AGL to the runway, if these parameters are exceeded the PM will
       announce “Go-Around” and the PF will execute a go-around/missed approach. If criteria
       for stable approach are met, the PM will state “500.”
       5.12.1.3. Momentary minor corrections or deviations are acceptable and defined as:
          5.12.1.3.1. Airspeed: +10/-5 kts from target
              5.12.1.3.1.1. Bank Angle: +/- 15 degrees from target
              5.12.1.3.1.2. Rate of Descent: +/- 300 FPM from target
   5.12.2. Descent Planning and Energy Management. Aircrews will ensure the aircraft is
   following the planned descent profile. All non-tactical descents should follow a normal
   descent profile IAW AFMAN 11-217V1 procedures and techniques in the absence of ATC
   or FLIP guidance. All tactical descents should follow published tactical procedures/profiles.
   When unforeseen interruptions alter the planned descent, immediately correct any deviations.
   It may be necessary to hold, request vectors, or take alternate actions in order to comply with
   the planned descent profile.
   5.12.3. Visual Transition. It is imperative for aircrews to review the airfield environment.
   Identify key features such as approach light type, airfield lighting, geographic
   layout/configuration of runways, taxiways, ramps, etc. To the max extent possible, this study
   will take place during the crew mission briefing and reviewed again prior to descent.
   5.12.4. Missed Approach/Go-Around. Aircrews will conduct a thorough briefing for
   anticipated missed approach/go-around scenarios. This briefing will include a discussion of
   specific crewmember duties.
   5.12.5. Tactical Approaches. It is recognized the above criteria is not always valid due to
   the type of tactical approach required. In these situations (either real-world or training as
   briefed by Intel/Tactics or attained from other valid threat sources, e.g. GCI, AWACS,
   Tower, etc.) the PF is required to brief the maneuver parameters prior to execution, to include
   when to expect the aircraft to be stable and when to go around. If the threat is known prior to
   departure, the crew will accomplish briefing prior to departure during mission planning. If
   the threat arises during the sortie, the PIC will include the stability requirements as part of the
   arrival briefing.
   5.12.6. FTUs only. FTUs will train students to ensure they understand and are capable of
   complying with all aspects of stabilized approach criterion. FTU instructors must use their
   expertise and experience to deviate from the guidelines of stabilized approach criteria as
   required during appropriate instructional scenarios.
5.13. Communications Policy. The Air Force does not give a promise of confidentiality to
aircrews regarding their recorded aircraft crew communications. Crewmembers are expected to
maintain a high degree of cockpit professionalism and crew coordination at all times.
   5.13.1. Aircraft Interphone. Primary crewmembers will monitor interphone during critical
   phases of flight. Crewmembers will advise the PF before checking off interphone.
   Crewmembers will ensure personnel on headset, or within listening distance, are cleared
   prior to discussing classified information over interphone. The PIC may allow the troop
   compartment and aft flight deck loadmasters to go off interphone at cruise provided the
   public address (PA) system is operative.

   5.13.1. (439AW) Crews will minimize the use of “Hot Mic” below 10,000 ft MSL. Hot Mic
   shall not be used below 1,000 ft AGL.
   5.13.2. Command Radios.
       5.13.2.1. The PM normally makes all air traffic control (ATC) radio calls.
       5.13.2.2. In terminal areas, all crewmembers (if able) will monitor the command radio
       unless directed otherwise. A crewmember will be designated to monitor C2 frequencies
       on the inbound and outbound legs.
       5.13.2.3. The pilot operating the radios will notify the crew which radio is primary, and
       update the crew when the primary radio changes.
       5.13.2.4. One pilot will record and read back all ATC clearances; another pilot will
       monitor and ensure correct read back.
       5.13.2.5. Both pilots will monitor UHF and VHF guard emergency frequencies to the
       maximum extent possible. EXCEPTION: Only one crewmember is required to monitor
       guard frequencies during tanker or receiver rendezvous and AAR.
       5.13.2.6. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) prohibits the use of
       unauthorized frequencies for interplane, HAVE QUICK, or SECURE VOICE training.
5.14. Crew Resource Management (CRM)/Threat and Error Management.
   5.14.1. Threat and Error Management provides strategies and tactics to help crews target
   threats to safe flight operations and decreases the potential for crew error. External threats
   are events that occur outside the influence of the flight crew and require crew attention and
   management to maintain adequate safety margins. Internal threats are crew related and are
   factors that could lead to an error if not recognized and controlled.
   5.14.2. "Time Out" is the common assertive statement for use by all crewmembers. The use
   of "Time Out" will:
       5.14.2.1. Provide a clear warning sign of a deviation or loss of situational awareness.
       5.14.2.2. Provide an opportunity to break the error chain before a mishap occurs.
       5.14.2.3. Notify all crewmembers when someone sees the aircraft or crew departing from
       established guidelines, the briefed scenario, or when someone is simply uncomfortable
       with the developing conditions.
       5.14.2.4. As soon as possible after a "Time Out" has been called, the aircrew will take
       the following actions:
       5.14.2.5. Safety permitting, stabilize the aircraft.
       5.14.2.6. The initiating crewmember will voice their concerns to the crew.
       5.14.2.7. The PIC will provide all other crewmembers with the opportunity to voice
       inputs relative to the stated concerns.
       5.14.2.8. After considering all inputs, the PIC will direct the aircrew to continue the
       current course of action or direct a new course of action.
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                           193


   5.14.3. Sterile Cockpit. With the exception of cruise flight, conversation below 18,000’ MSL
   will be limited to mission, departure, or approach essential items. Every effort will be made
   to accomplish briefings and appropriate checklists prior to top of descent (TOD). Sterile
   cockpit procedures also apply during taxi, and air refueling operations.
   5.14.4. Heads-up/Heads-down. Any crewmember that observes both pilots heads-down at
   the same time (other than heads-down instrument flying) shall alert the PF without delay.
   5.14.5. CRM Enhancement. PICs will conduct a CRM exercise on the first suitable segment
   of each mission. This will be done at level off on a non interference basis with other mission
   requirements. Take the exercise to a logical conclusion and ensure crew communications and
   duties are appropriate. Suggested topics are rapid decompression, oceanic contingency
   operation, emergency divert or other MAJCOM or locally generated Special Interest Item
   (SII).
   5.14.6. Critical Action Coordination. Those actions that are flight critical/irreversible in
   nature and should always be confirmed by another crew member. These actions include, but
   are not limited to: pulling the engine fire handle, placing the engine start switch to stop,
   discharging agent, and dumping fuel. Both pilots must verbally and visually identify the
   affected control, (i.e. “CONFIRM NUMBER ONE”). The pilot performing the action will
   point to the affected control. The pilot monitoring the action will verbally and visually
   confirm the proper control is selected, (i.e. “NUMBER ONE CONFIRMED”). The pilot
   performing the action then actuates the affected control.
5.15. Use of Automation. It is imperative that crews safely use automation. These procedures
provide an outline to maximize use of automation while ensuring safety is not compromised.
   5.15.1. General Automation Procedures. There must be a clear understanding of the Pilot
   Flying (PF) and the Pilot Monitoring (PM) duties at all times. Aircrews are expected to fly
   the aircraft using the highest level of automation, balanced with the requirement to maintain
   basic flying skills. However, Pilots are authorized to choose an appropriate level of
   automation consistent with changing flight environments. If the use of automation creates a
   loss of situational awareness or results in task saturation, shift to a less demanding level or
   disconnect the automation entirely and re-establish desired aircraft path and control. Both
   pilots are responsible for ensuring the aircraft is following the desired flight path.
   5.15.2. Verbalize, Verify, and Monitor (VVM) is a closed-loop system of communication
   designed to significantly reduce typical automation selection errors between the PF and PM.
   VVM consists of the following three step process:
       5.15.2.1. Prior to making any changes in the MCDU, FMS-800, AFCS Panel, etc., , the
       pilot making the entries will VERBALIZE the intended changes.
       5.15.2.2. Both pilots will VERIFY the intended changes prior to execution.
       5.15.2.3. Both pilots will MONITOR the aircraft to ensure the expected performance is
       achieved.
       5.15.2.4. The PF will announce changes to the level of automation, flight director and
       autopilot mode selections, and mode transitions to the maximum extent possible (e.g.
       “Autopilot engaged ”,“Altitude Hold”, “Autothrottles”, “Nav-Capture”, etc.). The PM
       will acknowledge the call.
194                                              AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


  5.15.3. FMS-800/MCDU Programming. Normally, the PM should make all FMS/MCDU
  inputs. Any change which will affect the lateral or vertical path should be coordinated with
  the PF before execution to ensure that the PF is aware of these changes. The PF will
  acknowledge and approve these changes by saying EXECUTE. The PF may elect to make
  FMS/MCDU inputs above 10,000’.
      5.15.3.1. With the autopilot engaged, the PF should make all changes to AFCS modes
      and settings, unless directed otherwise by the PF (this includes setting assigned headings
      and altitudes). In all cases the new settings will be verbally confirmed with the other
      pilot.
      5.15.3.2. With the autopilot disengaged, the PM should make all AFCS inputs at the
      direction of the PF. When receiving ATC vectors or altitude change clearances, the PM
      should automatically set assigned headings and engage HDG SEL mode, or set the new
      altitude and await the PF’s instructions to engage a vertical mode.
      5.15.3.3. VNAV. The Altitude Select Window is set by the PF and verbally confirmed
      by the PM. The commanded altitude depends on the vertical mode to be used for the
      climb/descent. If using VNAV, the PF may elect to set the highest level cleared in a
      climb or the lowest level cleared in a descent. This will allow VNAV management of the
      climb profile for intervening altitude restrictions. If not using VNAV, set current altitude
      clearance. Do not preselect a subsequent altitude until an altitude hold or altitude capture
      FMA is displayed and clearance to that altitude has been issued. At no time should an
      expected ATC clearance be set in the Altitude Select Window.
      5.15.3.4. Standard Terminology. When directing the PM to make AFCS inputs, clarity is
      of the utmost importance. Standard terminology aids clarity and brevity and ensures that
      crews effectively operate in concert with each other, while maintaining situational
      awareness. Although very precise, standard terminology can unnecessarily congest
      cockpit communication. Therefore, in-flight context may allow simplified direction and
      execution. For example “Preselect 10,000” is obviously an altitude command and does
      not require the noun “altitude” to clearly communicate the PF’s desires. Vertical speeds
      appended with UP or DOWN are sufficiently clear. Any time the PM is unsure of a
      command, he/she will ask for clarification. If an uncommanded FMA is displayed, the PF
      will clearly restate the command and ensure the correct change is made. The following
      standard terminology will be used:
         5.15.3.4.1. SELECT, SET or ENGAGE directs the selection of a value and/or a mode
         on the AFCS panel which results in the value being placed in the “engaged” (top
         green) portion of the FMA. SELECT or SET is normally used with rotary knobs;
         however, ENGAGE is acceptable.
         5.15.3.4.2. ARM directs the selection of a mode on the AFCS panel which results in
         the value being in the “armed” (bottom, cyan) portion of an FMA.
         5.15.3.4.3. ENGAGE should be used to request autopilot or autothrottle engagement.
         5.15.3.4.4. UP or DOWN should be used to indicate a change in vertical speed.
         5.15.3.4.5. EXECUTE should be used by the PF to indicate agreement with a
         programmed change to the flight path.
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                          195


          5.15.3.4.6. PRESET or PRESELECT should be used to change an AFCS value
          without changing the engaged or armed mode (e.g. when setting a missed approach
          heading before the missed approach point).
          5.15.3.4.7. Examples of use. Exact, scripted communication is not as important as
          clarity. The examples in AFTTP 3-3.C-5, under Approved Terminology, demonstrate
          how this terminology can be used to ensure clear, efficient communication between
          pilots. The general framework is action, axis, and setting, e.g. “SET SPEED 250”.
5.16. Transportation of Pets. Transporting pets (dogs and cats) in conjunction with the
sponsor’s permanent change of station is authorized. Other pets or animals are normally
prohibited, but may be moved according to DoD 4515.13R, Air Transportation Management.
5.17. Alcoholic Beverages. The MAJCOM/A3/DO or NAF/CC may authorize the dispensing
of alcoholic beverages.
5.18. Runway, Taxiway, and Airfield Requirements.
   5.18.1. Minimum Runway and Taxiway Requirements. The following lengths and widths are
   for normal operations. In all cases, ensure obstacle clearance requirements are met. Landing
   distance will not exceed runway available.
      5.18.1.1. Runway Length. Minimum runway length is 6000 feet (1,830 meters).
      5.18.1.2. Runway Width. Minimum runway width is 147 feet (45 meters).
      5.18.1.3. Taxiway Width. Minimum taxiway width is 75 feet (23 meters). If a 180-
      degree turn is required, 150 feet (46 meters) of stressed pavement (e.g. runway/taxiway
      intersection) is required.
   5.18.2. Runway Length for Takeoff and Landing. Do not takeoff if computed critical field
   length exceeds runway available. Minimum runway for a normal landing is landing distance
   based on a threshold crossing height of 50 feet.
      5.18.2.1. Runway Length for Takeoff and Intersection Takeoffs. Normally, the PF will
      initiate takeoffs from the beginning of the approved usable portion of the runway. The
      decision to make intersection takeoffs rests solely with the PIC.
      5.18.2.2. Pilots may accomplish intersection takeoffs provided the operating
      environment (i.e., gross weight, obstructions, climb criteria, weather, etc.) allows a safe
      takeoff and departure. Calculate takeoff performance based on the runway remaining
      from the point at which the takeoff is initiated.
      5.18.2.3. During operations on runways partially covered with snow or ice, base takeoff
      computations on the reported runway surface condition (RSC) or RCR for the cleared
      portion of the runway. A minimum of 50 feet either side of centerline should be cleared.
      If 50 feet either side of centerline is not cleared, compute takeoff data based on the
      uncleared portion up to 50 feet either side of centerline.
      5.18.2.4. Use of Overruns. If approach end overruns are available and stressed or
      authorized for normal operations, they may be used to increase the runway available for
      takeoff. Departure end overruns (if stressed and authorized) may also be used for landing
      if needed.
196                                             AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


  5.18.3. Arresting Cables.
      5.18.3.1. Do not land on (touchdown on) approach end arresting cables (does not include
      recessed cables). If the aircraft lands before the cable, the crew should contact the tower
      to have the cable inspected.
      5.18.3.2. Do not takeoff or land over an approach end cable that has been reported as
      slack, loose, or improperly rigged by NOTAM, automated terminal information service
      (ATIS), or ATC.
      5.18.3.3. Operations are authorized on runways where BAK-12 systems with an eight-
      point cable tie-down system are installed. When operating from runways equipped with
      other types of systems, or if it is unknown whether the BAK-12 system includes eight
      point tiedowns, aircrews should recognize the increased risk of damage to the aircraft.
  5.18.4. Other Airfield Requirements.
      5.18.4.1. Consult with AMC/A3AS (Airfield Suitability Branch) for suitability guidance.
      Airfield certification requirements are detailed in the ASRR.
      5.18.4.2. Aircrews and planning agencies will contact AMC/A3AS for all questions
      pertaining to airfield weight bearing capacity and will review the GDSS/GDSS2/ASRR
      before all off-station operations. AMC/A3 is the waiver authority for the restrictions in
      GDSS/GDSS2 Giant Report and ASRR for AMC and AMC-gained aircraft, unless
      specifically delegated in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 3 or AMCI 11-208. Direct GDSS/GDSS2
      Giant Report and ASRR waiver requests to AMC/A3AS. AMC/A3V is the OPR for
      waivers to airfield restrictions. MAJCOM/A3 is the waiver authority for non-AMC
      missions. The PIC is responsible for waiver compliance. Aircrews will consult the web-
      based airfield database maintained by AMC/A3AS (Airfield Suitability Branch) and
      comply with the GDSS/GDSS2/ASRR for updates to airfield operability and weight
      bearing capability.
  5.18.5. RCR Limitations. When no RCR is available, the PIC will refer to the performance
  manual for standard ICAO conversions based on general runway condition; be conservative
  when dealing with unknown conditions (e.g., forward operating bases (FOBs), unpaved
  runways). Minimum RCR for takeoff or landing is the lowest RCR depicted in the flight
  manual (never less than 3). Normally, RCR values are not reported for taxiways and ramps.
  During periods of reported low RCR, the taxiways and ramps may have an even lower RCR
  than reported for the runway. Consider the runway surface as wet when there is sufficient
  water on the surface to cause a reflective glare or when rain is falling.
  5.18.6. Wind Limitations. Airfields will be considered below minimums for takeoff and
  landing when winds (including gusts) are greater than:
      5.18.6.1. Maximum wind (any direction)—50 knots.
      5.18.6.2. Maximum tailwind component—10 knots.
      5.18.6.3. Maximum crosswind components, corrected for RCR, as specified in the flight
      manual. For actual category II ILS approaches, the maximum crosswind component is 10
      knots or as specified in the flight manual, whichever is lower.

5.19. Aircraft Taxi and Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria and Foreign Object Damage
(FOD) Avoidance.
   5.19.1. Do not taxi an aircraft within 25 feet of obstructions without wing walkers
   monitoring the clearance between aircraft and obstruction. With wing walkers, avoid taxi
   obstructions by at least 10 feet. EXCEPTION: IAW AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and
   Movement on the Ground, aircraft may taxi without marshallers/wing walkers at home
   station along fixed taxi lines which have been measured to ensure a minimum of 10 feet
   clearance from any permanent obstruction. Adjacent aircraft are also considered a permanent
   obstruction, provided the aircraft is parked properly in its designated spot and is not moving.
   Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) and vehicles are considered a permanent obstruction,
   provided it is parked entirely within a designated area. Areas will be designated by
   permanent markings such as painted boxes or lines on the ramp or another suitable means.
   5.19.2. When taxi clearance is doubtful, use one or more wing walkers. If wing walkers are
   unavailable, deplane one or more crewmembers to maintain obstruction clearance and
   provide marshaling using AFI 11-218 signals. Use wing walkers, deplaned crewmembers, or
   a crewmember on interphone positioned at a door to act as an observer while maneuvering on
   narrow taxiways. During night taxi operations, marshallers shall have an illuminated wand in
   each hand. Wing walkers are only required to have one illuminated wand. Observers should
   be in a position to see wing walkers at all times (through door or windows) and communicate
   with the pilot.
   5.19.3. FOD Avoidance. Make every effort to minimize the potential for engine FOD. Crews
   should:
      5.19.3.1. Carefully review airfield layout paying particular attention to taxi routes, turn
      requirements, and areas for potential FOD.
      5.19.3.2. Minimize power settings during all taxi operations.
   5.19.4. Taxi Criteria. Refer to Table 5.5 for minimum taxi clearance criteria. Use extreme
   caution when scanning from inside the airplane. Wing tip and tail growth in turns and the
   distance from the fuselage to the wing tip make determination of actual clearance very
   difficult.

Table 5.5. Minimum Taxi Clearance Criteria.

      5.19.4.1. Where possible, avoid 180° turns. If it becomes necessary to accomplish a 180°
      turn on a narrow runway, the turn should be accomplished at an intersection of a link
      taxiway or at a designated turn around pad. Normally, the airplane is positioned on the
      opposite side of the runway and the turn is made toward an intersecting taxiway.
 198                                              AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


       5.19.4.2. Where possible, avoid taxi operations that position an engine over an
       unprepared or un-swept surface. If unavoidable, leave the engine in idle (to the maximum
       extent possible) until the engine is over an improved surface.
       5.19.4.3. After landing and clearing the runway, and with approval of the PIC, the
       loadmaster may open the aft cargo door and lower the ramp to prepare for cargo
       off/onload provided equipment, and cargo remain secure in the cargo compartment.
5.20. Fuel Jettison Procedures.
   5.20.1. Aircrews should consider burning down fuel versus jettison, unless safety of flight
   dictates an immediate jettison (as determined by the pilot in command). Except in the case of
   an emergency, before jettisoning fuel, notify the appropriate ATC or flight service facility of
   intentions, altitude, and location. If available, the PIC will use designated jettison areas,
   except when safety of flight would be compromised.
   5.20.2. For missions tasked by higher headquarters authority, the tasking C2 agency may
   authorize fuel jettison when an urgent operational requirement dictates immediate
   recovery/reconstitution of the aircraft and/or aircrew. The tasking C2 agency may provide
   fuel jettison instructions in the OPORD, mission directive, SPINS, etc.
   5.20.3. For training missions, the OG/CC may approve fuel jettison when an urgent
   operational requirement exists to expedite recovery of the aircraft and all alternatives have
   been exhausted.
   5.20.4. OG/CCs will establish jettison areas and procedures to minimize the impact of fuel
   jettisoning. Ideally, establish jettison areas at altitudes above 20,000 feet AGL, off published
   airways, avoiding urban areas, agricultural regions, and water supply sources. Avoid circling
   descents. Initiate AF Form 813, Request for Environmental Impact Analysis, and submit it to
   the base environmental coordinator.
   5.20.5. All jettisons will be followed up with a detailed report filed by the pilot in command
   immediately after landing using a MAJCOM approved form for unusual occurrence or
   inflight emergency. Submit completed form through unit OGV to MAJCOM/Stan Eval. Unit
   OGVs will retain forms for 6 months. Document all pertinent information, including the
   following items:
       5.20.5.1. Scheduled Duration.
       5.20.5.2. Actual Duration.
       5.20.5.3. Landing Gross Weight.
       5.20.5.4. Computed Stopping Distance.
       5.20.5.5. Recovery Field.
       5.20.5.6. Runway Available.
       5.20.5.7. Jettison Altitude/Location.
       5.20.5.8. Outside air temperature.
       5.20.5.9. Wind direction and velocity.

5.21. Aircraft Speed. IAW AFI11-202V3 and flight manual.
5.22. Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Programs. BASH programs are
centralized unit efforts that provide information cross-feed, hazard identification, and a
consolidated course of action. As a minimum, unit commanders must implement the following
procedures:
   5.22.1. Ensure compliance with the following Bird Watch condition restrictions.
      5.22.1.1. Bird Watch Condition Low - No operating restrictions.
      5.22.1.2. Bird Watch Condition Moderate - Initial takeoffs and final landings allowed
      only when departure and arrival routes will avoid bird activity. Local IFR/VFR traffic
      pattern activity is prohibited.
      5.22.1.3. Bird Watch Condition Severe - All takeoffs and landings are prohibited.
      Waiver authority is local OG/CC or equivalent. Parent MAJCOM/A3 waiver is required
      to operate at airfields not controlled by the MAF.
   5.22.2. Commanders establish Phase II of the BASH program during increased periods of
   migratory bird activity. Schedulers shall make every effort to not schedule takeoffs, landings,
   and low-levels from one hour before to one hour after sunrise and sunset during the Phase II
   period. Publish significant bird hazards in FLIP Area Planning (AP) and the IFR Supplement
   along with the associated airfield operating hour restrictions and avoidance instructions.
   5.22.3. When operating at airfields where no BASH program exists, a PIC has the authority
   to delay takeoffs and arrivals due to bird condition after coordinating with the appropriate C2
   authority.
   5.22.4. Consider bird migratory patterns during the en route portion of the mission to help
   minimize the potential of an in-flight bird strike. The Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) on
   AFSC/SEF website contains BASH information including regionalized Continental United
   States (CONUS) bird migration patterns, Portable Flight Planning System (PFPS) software
   overlay, and the latest news. The Avian Hazard Advisory System (AHAS) website is another
   source for real time bird hazard information. Both sites may be accessed through the AMC
   aircrew      mission      planning     portal     at:         https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
   af/afp40/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?command=org&channelPageId=-1325640&pageId=0
   See AFPAM 91-212, Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Management Techniques, for
   additional information.
   5.22.5. Following a bird strike, aircrews should land as soon as conditions permit, or as
   practicable, to have the aircraft inspected by qualified maintenance personnel. Bird strike
   damage cannot be accurately assessed in-flight, and undetected damage may result in a
   complex airborne emergency.
5.23. Functional Check Flights (FCFs), Acceptance Check Flights (ACFs) and Operational
Check Flights (OCFs). Check flights will be accomplished IAW T.O. 1C-5A-6, AFI 21-101,
Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management, T.O. 1-1-300, Functional Check Flights and
Maintenance Operational Checks, and T.O. 1C-5-6CF-1, Acceptance and/or Functional Check

Procedures Manual. Crews should only perform tasks or functions contained in specific
technical order guidance. If requested to perform a non-standard function, PICs should contact
their OG/CC to see if an FCF applies.
   5.23.1. The OG/CC, or deployed equivalent, may authorize temporary waivers to FCF
   procedures for aircrew qualification when operationally necessary. Permanent waivers
   require MAJCOM/A3/DO approval IAW Chapter 1.
   5.23.2. The OG/CC is responsible for the wing FCF program. Publish additional guidance in
   local supplement to this instruction. The OG/CC may authorize a partial FCF to check only
   those systems disturbed by maintenance, an inspection or modification.
   5.23.3. Conduct check flights within the designated check flight airspace of the base from
   which the flight was launched except when the flight must be conducted under specific
   conditions, not compatible with local conditions and area restrictions.
       5.23.3.1. FCF/ACFs that involve airworthiness and/or safety of flight checks require
       parachutes, helmets, oxygen masks and survival kits to be on board for all personnel.
   5.23.4. The decision to approve a combined FCF and ferry flight is the responsibility of the
   MAJCOM/A3/DO.
   5.23.5. The OG/CC will only certify highly experienced instructors as FCF crewmembers.
   The OG/CC will determine FCF crew complement after a thorough ORM assessment for that
   specific FCF flight. ACF certified aircrew will only perform the work package they are
   certified to conduct. OCFs do not require FCF/ACF certification but should be accomplished
   by experienced crewmembers.
       5.23.5.1. FCF crewmembers will be certified IAW 11-2FT Vol 1 and AFMC certified
       training plans located on HQ AFMC Stan/Eval COP. ACF certified crewmembers will
       receive training IAW 11-2FT Vol 1 and a training plan tailored to the ACF work
       package. This training plan will be coordinated with the 339 FLTS.
       5.23.5.2. FCF or ACF certification will be annotated on the individual’s letter of X’s.
       Certification applies only to the current C-5 model that the individual is qualified in.
       Differences training will be conducted if the individual changes qualification.
       5.23.5.3. FCF/ACF crews will comply with the additional training/currency requirements
       IAW 11-2FT (e.g., hanging harness, 180 day FCF currency etc.) which will be tracked by
       local ARMS products. EXCEPTION: FCF currency may be maintained in the
       simulator.
       5.23.5.4. Prior to conducting FCF/ACF the AC will review AFMC FCIFs for applicable
       guidance.
   5.23.6. Ideally, conduct FCFs in daylight, VMC. OG/CCs may authorize a flight under a
   combination of VMC and IMC. Begin the flight in VMC. If the aircraft and all systems are
   operating properly, the crew may proceed IFR through cloud cover to “VFR on Top” for the
   altitude phase of the flight. Preflights will not be conducted in the rain/snow or on a wet
   aircraft.
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                         201


       5.23.6.1. FCF/ACF profiles will be tailored from T.O. 1C-5A-6CF or 1C-5M-6CF to suit
       specific work packages. Prior coordination with the 339 FLTS will be accomplished to
       ensure all appropriate checks will be complied with.
   5.23.7. If a malfunction occurs during a FCF, the OG/CC may subsequently release the
   aircraft for flight providing the malfunction is not related to the condition generating the
   FCF, and the original condition operationally checked good.
   5.23.8. Only FCF crews shall perform high-speed taxi checks. Perform checks IAW the
   flight manual and maintenance technical orders. Prepare the aircraft with minimum fuel
   necessary to accomplish the check to limit brake/tire wear, (ensure fuel on board will permit
   a safe return to base should the aircraft unexpectedly become airborne) and turn on the anti-
   skid system. The PIC will calculate takeoff data for the highest speed planned and ensure
   runway available allows sufficient stopping distance for existing conditions without
   exceeding normal brake energy limits.
   5.23.9. Operational Check Flights (OCF). An OCF is a flight that does not require an FCF.
   OCFs cover conditions which require verification of maintenance by the accomplishments of
   an in-flight procedure or when test equipment does not exist to perform the check on the
   ground. Units may perform an OCF provided local operating procedures are published IAW
   this AFI.
   5.23.9.1. The Ram Air Turbine check is an OCF item. Only the Traffic Pattern RAT
   (manual) check from 1C-5A-6/1C-5M-6 is authorized. The check may be accomplished at
   the end of a local training sortie or, if on a departure, a full stop taxi back will be
   accomplished for a maintenance inspection as required.
5.24. Participation in Aerial Events. See AFI 11-209, Aerial Event Policy and Procedures,
and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement.
5.25. Traffic Alerting and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). It is imperative to follow
resolution advisories (RAs) to obtain aircraft separation computed by TCAS. Failure to follow
the computed RA may increase the probability of a midair collision. Pilots who deviate from an
ATC clearance in response to an RA shall notify ATC of the deviation as soon as practical and
promptly return to the ATC clearance when the traffic conflict is resolved or obtain a new
clearance.
5.26. Radar Altimeter. (N/A AMP and C-5M)
   5.26.1. Any crewmember detecting the illumination of the radar altimeter Low Altitude
   Warning Light will immediately notify the pilot flying the aircraft. Terrain clearance and
   aircraft position must be verified.
   5.26.2. Before departure set the radar altimeter for emergency return. Normally, use the
   height above touchdown/height above aerodrome (HAT/HAA) for IMC, or 500 feet for
   VMC departures.
   5.26.3. Not used.
   5.26.4. Set the radar altimeter to the HAT/HAA during instrument approaches.
5.27. Reduced Power Takeoffs. Accomplish IAW T.O. 1C-5A-1 or 1C-5M-1 and T.O. 1C-
5A-1-1 or 1C-5M-1-1.
 202                                              AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


5.28. Aircraft Recovery from Unprepared Surfaces. Aircrews should not attempt to recover
an aircraft after inadvertent entry onto unprepared surfaces not suitable for taxi; ground crews
will accomplish aircraft recovery. Unless an emergency dictates otherwise, aircrews may only
accomplish recovery if there is no aircraft damage, the surface will support the aircraft, and the
PIC has coordinated with appropriate MAJCOM headquarters maintenance authorities through
618 AOC (TACC), or appropriate C2 agency.
5.29. Aircrew Fatigue. It is the crewmember’s responsibility to be properly rested for each
mission. However, if circumstances prevent this, no MAF/AMC crewmember should feel
pressured to fly when not properly rested. A PIC with a crewmember that is fatigued should
immediately notify the Stage Manager, 618 AOC (TACC), Home Station, or appropriate
Command and Control if unable to start or complete a mission safely. Declaring “Safety of
Flight” may be required in this situation.
5.30. Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP). The Military Aviation Safety Action Program
is an anonymous, self-reporting system modeled after successful FAA/Airline programs to
encourage the voluntary reporting Operational issues and events. It is designed to provide a non-
punitive environment for the open reporting of safety concerns and information that might be
critical to identifying hazardous situations and precursors to accidents. These safety concerns
may be either observed or experienced by the submitter. The goal is to prevent mishaps by
addressing those unintentional errors, hazardous situations and events, or high-risk activities not
identified and/or correctable by other methods or through traditional safety reporting sources.
   5.30.1. The AMC ASAP website is accessible at www.safety-masap.com. Username and
   Password can be obtained from the crewmember’s Wing/Group Safety office. Crewmembers
   can contact the AMC ASAP program manager via email at amc.asap@scott.af.mil. AFRC
   has a similar program called Close Call that can be found on AFRC’s Safety website through
   the             AF             Portal             at           https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-

       6.2.11.1. (Added-439AW) If the seal is broken, accomplish an inventory of the tools
       prior to departing the aircraft.
6.3. Pre-Mission Actions.
   6.3.1. Before transiting areas outside the CONUS, aircrews will review and obtain theater-
   specific information necessary to successfully operate there. The review, at a minimum,
   should include AFI 11-202V3, Air Force Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (AFFTP) 3-
   3.C-5, Combat Aircraft Fundamentals – C-5, and the following:
       6.3.1.1. . Review tasking, itinerary, and altitude reservation (ALTRV) requirements.
       6.3.1.2. . Review applicable OPORD, SPINS, Virtual Risk Assessment (VRA), Country
       Risk Assessment (CRA), and FLIP. Obtain and carry this information if required.
       6.3.1.3. Review the FCG for areas of operation (to include classified portion). Obtain
       necessary diplomatic clearances where required.
   6.3.2. Obtain required customs forms.
   6.3.3. Obtain worldwide FLIPs and sufficient communications security (COMSEC)
   materials for the duration of the mission.
   6.3.4. Ensure physiological training, annual physical, immunizations, and flight evaluations
   will remain current for all crewmembers throughout the TDY period.
   6.3.5. Ensure visas have been received, if required.
   6.3.6. Obtain terrain charts for unfamiliar destinations if available.
   6.3.7. Compile sufficient spare forms, flight orders, etc. to cover the TDY period.
   6.3.8. Passenger Restrictions. Release space available seats to the maximum extent possible
   unless overriding safety, legal or security concerns prohibit space available travelers from
   flying on specific missions. The only passengers on missions transporting DVs will be those
   of the official party and those space available passengers authorized by the lead POC for the
   traveling party. Authorization must be approved 24 hours in advance.
       6.3.8.1. Space Available Passengers. For other than revenue and White House missions,
       PICs are authorized to release space available seats on mission legs when no official
       passengers are aboard (positioning and de-positioning legs). Coordinate with C2 agency
       to release available seats to the passenger terminal. PICs are encouraged to release
       maximum space available seats subject to the following restrictions:
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                             205


           6.3.8.1.1. Revenue Missions. These are missions for which the using agency
           (typically a government agency other than DoD) is reimbursing DoD for use of the
           aircraft. Space available passengers on revenue missions must be approved 24 hours
           in advance by USAF/ CVAM, theater AMD or JOSAC (as appropriate) and the using
           agency contact officer through unit C2 agencies. This is essential to ensure proper
           funding and reimbursement. Consult C2 to determine mission revenue status if in
           doubt. Congressional Delegations (CODEL) are not revenue missions.
           6.3.8.1.2. White House Support Missions. Space available passengers will generally
           not be permitted aboard White House support mission aircraft without express
           permission of HQ USAF/CVAM. This is normally due to the security status of the
           aircraft, which may include positioning and de-positioning legs. When it is necessary
           to move aircrew members or support personnel on White House support mission
           aircraft, the WHMO will be advised and permission obtained through the unit C2 and
           CVAM. On de-positioning legs space available passengers will usually be permitted
           if the aircraft is no longer required to maintain an upgraded security status.
           6.3.8.1.3. Billing. Space available passengers on revenue missions may be subject to
           being billed commercial first-class airfare by the using agency for the applicable
           route, depending on that agency's policy. If the DV or on-board contact officer
           releases seats, aircraft commander must ensure that any additional financial liability
           for the passengers is specified by the using agency on-board contact officer. PIC will
           ensure passengers understand and agree to any reimbursement conditions prior to
           boarding.
   6.3.9. Ensure the correct aircraft navigation database is loaded or will be carried, as
   appropriate.
       6.3.9.1. Aircrews are directed to compare their scheduled return times with the
       expiration of the loaded navigation database prior to departure from home station. If the
       scheduled return time exceeds the expiration of the database, add the appropriate info
       note to the aircraft forms prior to departure from home station to ensure maintenance
       personnel are aware of the need to load a new database.
6.4. Aircrew Publications Requirements. Primary crewmembers will carry (or have in-flight
access to) the publications specified in Table 6.1 on all missions. These publications may be
either individual crewmember’s or contained in unit developed publications kits. “P” designates
the publication is required to be carried in paper format. “D” designates the publication may be
carried in either paper or digital format. If publications are carried in a digital format, the unit
will provide the media to view the digital publications. Units may specify additional publications
in their local unit supplement. Reference AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals Program, for
guidance on electronic publications.
   6.4.1. (Added-439AW) Carriage of paper publications.
       6.4.1.1. (Added-439AW) All crewmembers will carry their handheld checklists.

6.5. Airfield Review. Aircrews will consult the web-based airfield database maintained by
AMC/A3AS (Airfield Suitability Branch) and comply with the GDSS/GDSS2/ASRR for updates
to airfield operability and weight bearing capability. Refer to AFI 11-202V3 Chapter 8 for non-
US Government and Foreign Terminal Instrument Procedures.
6.6. Aircrew Intelligence Briefing. Aircrews will receive an intelligence briefing that will
emphasize terrorist, enemy, and friendly political and military development in the area in which
they will be flying. Obtain timely intelligence updates prior to entering a specific area of
operations (AOR). In theater, aircrews should receive intelligence updates on initial arrival at a
forward operating location (FOL), or en route stop, and thereafter when significant developments
occur. Report information of possible intelligence value to the local intelligence office as soon as
practical to ensure timely dissemination of mission reports (MISREPs).

Section 6B—Pre-departure

6.7. Global Decision Scheduling System 2 (GDSS2) Account. Pilots will obtain a GDSS2
account prior to operating on IFM-planned sorties. Download aircrew departure papers using the
GDSS2 account, at locations without an AMC C2 presence. For operational missions, ensure
GDSS2 account passwords are active prior to departing home station. There is also a web-based
version of GDSS2 that can be accessed using a CAC at the following link:
https://gdss2ams.c2.amc.af.mil/gdss2web/
6.8. Flight Crew Information File (FCIF).
   6.8.1. Crewmembers will review FCIF, Volume 1, before all missions or ground aircrew
   duties, and update the FCIF currency record with the latest FCIF item number, date, and
   crewmember's initials.
       6.8.1.1. Electronic signatures, or PEX Sign-Off, may be used on FCIFs.
   6.8.2. Crewmembers delinquent in FCIF review or joining a mission en route will receive an
   FCIF update from a primary aircrew member counterpart on the mission.
   6.8.3. Crewmembers not assigned or attached to the unit operating a mission will certify
   FCIF review by entering the last FCIF number and their initials after their name on the file
   copy of the flight authorization or file copy of their crew orders. This applies to all
   crewmembers if the electronic sign-in system is not working at show time.
6.9. Flight Crew Bulletins (FCB). Items in the FCB may include local procedures and policies
concerning equipment and personnel generally not found in any other publications.
6.10. Mission Kits. Carry mission kits on all operational missions. Publications and forms may

6.12. Briefing Requirements.
   6.12.1. Pre-Departure Briefing Items. The PIC will contact the local C2 agency to confirm
   mission requirements. The PIC and controlling agency jointly share responsibility to identify
   special briefing requirements. Briefings may include buffer zone, electronic warfare
   activities, SAFE PASSAGE, Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), diplomatic clearance,
   hazardous cargo, anti-hijacking procedures, operations and safety supplements to flight
   manuals, and OPORD procedure.
   6.12.2. Pilot in Command Pre-Departure Briefing. Cover all applicable items of the
   operations briefing, including MAJCOM, NAF, unit special interest items (SIIs), CRM, and
   ORM levels and mitigating factors. Brief crewmembers on the specific mission details if not
   previously accomplished. Use a MAJCOM approved briefing guide.
       6.12.2.1. Pilot in Command En Route Briefing. In the en route system, the PIC will
       ensure that an aircrew briefing is conducted prior to the first sortie of the day. As a
       minimum, brief crewmembers on specific mission details for that day's sortie(s), CRM,
       and the ORM level and mitigating factors for the mission. Complete this briefing prior to
       engine start.
   6.12.3. Specialized Briefing. Use specialized briefings to detail operating procedures or SIIs
   peculiar to various crew positions, and to answer questions relating to those specialties.
   Specialized briefings review tactics and procedures, AAR information, and technical
   instructions for specialized equipment operations. All crewmembers should attend each
   briefing. Crewmembers may only be excused from specialized briefings for pre-flight duties,
   however the PIC will back brief all appropriate items. Use a MAJCOM approved specialized
   briefing guide.
   6.12.4. Weather Briefings. The PIC will obtain a briefing on current weather, trends, and
   forecast for the proposed route, destination, and alternates. The PIC will brief primary
   crewmembers on appropriate weather conditions before departure.
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                               211


       6.12.4.1. Aircrews flying flight-managed sorties will use the weather briefing provided
       with the IFM aircrew departure papers. This weather briefing satisfies requirement for
       6.12.4. Local weather flights/agencies may update local takeoff weather data, but
       aircrews, working through their flight manager/dispatcher, will use 618 AOC (TACC)
       weather operations (or the Operational Weather Squadron (OWS) supporting the theater
       C2 Agency) as the final arbiter for weather-related issues and further updates.
       6.12.4.2. On sorties not planned by a flight manager, crews should obtain weather
       information from their local weather flight or the OWS responsible for weather support at
       their location.
       6.12.4.3. If adequate services are not available, and the crew cannot contact their home
       weather flight, OWS, or 618 AOC (TACC) weather operations, obtain weather through
       any means available prior to mission accomplishment.
       6.12.4.4. Weather information is permitted from US Military weather services, any
       FAA-approved weather source, or any host nation civil or military weather source.
   6.12.5. Buffer Zone. Prior to operating an aircraft within, or adjacent to, an established
   buffer zone, the PIC will ensure primary crewmembers are briefed on current buffer zone
   procedures outlined in appropriate directives.
   6.12.6. Peacetime and Wartime SAFE PASSAGE Procedures. Pilots must be familiar with
   peacetime and wartime safe passage of friendly military aircraft.
   6.12.7. IFM Briefing. PICs will thoroughly review the aircrew departure papers provided for
   IFM sorties. The PIC, or designated representative, will contact the flight manager if there
   are discrepancies with the departure papers or to resolve any questions before signing the
   flight plan.
   6.12.8. Training/Evaluation    Briefing.    Before   all   training/evaluation missions,
   instructors/flight examiners will brief the crew on requirements and objectives for each
   student or examinee.
   6.12.9. Intelligence Briefings. Before operating in a combat environment, the crew will
   obtain a current intelligence briefing.
6.13. Call Signs.
   6.13.1. Training Missions. Aircraft will use the unit static call sign prefix followed by a 2-
   digit suffix assigned by the parent unit.
   6.13.1. (439AW) Unit static call sign is “RODD” followed by the PIC’s assigned 2-digit
   call sign number. Use the “RODD01” call sign when the Wing Commander and “RODD02”
   when the Ops Group Commander is on the flight. Exception: For all air refueling training
   missions, use “RODD99”.
   6.13.2. Operational Missions. Use call signs assigned by OPORD, FRAG, or diplomatic
   clearance. If no call sign has been assigned, use unit static call signs. When flying AMC
   missions, and no other call sign has been assigned, use the “REACH” call sign followed by
   the last digit of the year the aircraft was built and the last 3 digits of the aircraft tail number
   (or as required by diplomatic clearance). To complete flight plans, put the letters "RCH"
 212                                               AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


   followed by the last digit of the year the aircraft was built and the last 3 digits of the aircraft
   tail number.
   6.13.3. The Reach 01 and 18 call signs are reserved for the AMC/CC and 18 AF/CC.
   6.13.4. Aeromedical Evacuation (AE). For actual AE missions, use the call sign “Evac"
   followed by the five-digit aircraft number (example, Evac 12345) or mission designator.
   Refer to FLIP GP Chapter 4. When the AE portion of the mission is completed, normal call
   signs will be used. This does not alleviate the responsibility to use diplomatically cleared call
   signs when required.
6.14. Instrument Flight Rules. Conduct flight operations under IFR to the maximum extent
possible without unacceptable mission degradation.
6.15. Flight Plan/Data Verification.
   6.15.1. Computer Flight Plan (CFP) Use. CFPs are the official sources of performance,
   navigation, and climatic data, including en route wind information. If stand-alone computer
   based plans are used, each mission segment should utilize best wind data available. Use only
   MAJCOM validated CFPs.
       6.15.1.1. Use CFPs to the maximum extent practical. Flight crews may manually
       compute flight plans. The PIC has final responsibility for flight plan accuracy and
       diplomatic clearance compliance.
          6.15.1.1.1. Flight plan uplink. Airline operational control (AOC) use is authorized for
          “flight Plan Uplink”. To use, send the FM a request. If no response is received within
          5 minutes, contact the FM via other means or upload manually. The PIC is
          responsible for verifying waypoints and flight plan accuracy.
       6.15.1.2. Verify CFPs for route of flight and fuel computation accuracy before departure.
       Pass any flight plan discrepancies to the C2 flight planning office. On flight-managed
       sorties, promptly notify the flight manager of any flight plan discrepancies, to ensure the
       correct route of flight is filled with air traffic control.
       6.15.1.3. Inform your Flight Manager when the average wind for a route segment
       exceeds either 30 degrees error in direction, 25 knots in speed, or when temperature
       deviation error exceeds 5 degrees for the flight planned altitude. If unable to report
       inflight, report actual winds or temperatures at the first opportunity.
   6.15.2. All waypoint data retrieved from a database should be verified by one or more of the
   following methods:
       6.15.2.1. Latitude/longitude from current FLIP.
       6.15.2.2. Bearing/distance from a flight plan.
       6.15.2.3. Ground Based NAVAIDs.
6.16. Departure Planning. Use AFI 11-202V3, AFMAN 11-217, this chapter, and the
appropriate MAJCOM supplements. Regardless of the type of departure flown (IFR/VFR),
review the following (as appropriate): IFR Departure Procedure, instrument approach plate,
NOTAMS, GDSS Giant Report, and suitable terrain charts. At the earliest opportunity but NLT
one hour prior to scheduled takeoff time, the PIC shall provide the engineer with a completed
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                           213


MAJCOM approved Departure Planning Worksheet (current version of worksheet located on
AMC/A3V and Jeppesen websites). Complete all applicable sections of worksheet which must
include as a minimum the following; SDP information, takeoff runway direction, length, slope,
screen height (non-SDP), height and distance of any known obstacles affecting departure path
(non-SDP), and four engine climb gradient restrictions. The PIC may use the SDP weight, with
applicable corrections applied, as a planning max weight to pass to C2 agencies for next mission
leg.
   6.16.1. VFR Departures.      NOTE: VFR departures will not be flown in lieu of obstacle
   clearance planning.
       6.16.1.1. VFR departures are authorized when there is no authorized IFR departure
       method for the airport, when the aircraft cannot depart using one of the IFR departure
       methods contained in AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V1, when operational
       requirements dictate (i.e. tactical necessity), or when most of the sortie is planned as a
       VFR flight. VFR departures require detailed planning to ensure obstacles and terrain are
       avoided.
       6.16.1.2. IAW AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V2 crews are specifically authorized
       to depart VFR without meeting IFR departure procedure restrictions along the planned
       departure route with one engine inoperative while adhering to the following:
           6.16.1.2.1. Utilize radar advisory, monitoring, or control services when practical, and
           ensure flight following by any available means (e.g., FSS or C2).
           6.16.1.2.2. Crews must be knowledgeable of and comply with guidance contained in
           AFMAN 11-217V2.
           6.16.1.2.3. Crews are responsible for terrain and obstacle planning/avoidance and
           must climb to the Minimum IFR Altitude (MIA) as soon as practical.
           6.16.1.2.4. Crews will use all available resources to mitigate risk. This includes (but
           not limited to) supervisors, ORM, aircraft flight manuals, and aircraft commander
           discretion.
           6.16.1.2.5. Operations IAW this authorization are to be used as the last resort when
           the mission justifies the increased risk.
       6.16.1.3. The minimum climb performance for VFR departures is determined by
       ensuring all the following conditions are met:
           6.16.1.3.1. All-engine climb capability ensures obstacle avoidance along the
           departure route.
           6.16.1.3.2. One Engine Inoperative (OEI) climb capability shall ensure departure or
           emergency return route provides obstacle avoidance. NOTE: If unable to comply
           with any of the above conditions, download cargo/fuel or delay until conditions that
           are more favorable exist.
       6.16.1.4. Refer to FLIP for host nation VFR requirements before flying VFR outside of
       CONUS.
       6.16.1.5. When departing VFR, maintain VFR cloud clearances until obtaining an IFR
       clearance or reaching the IFR MEA.
214                                             AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


  6.16.2. IFR Departures: Aircrews must use an approved IFR departure method as outlined
  in AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V1.
      6.16.2.1. An IFR departure is not authorized at airfields without an instrument approach.
      6.16.2.2. IFR departures require detailed planning to ensure obstacles and high terrain
      are avoided. Adhere to screen height/departure end of runway (DER) requirements for
      IFR departure planning (AFMAN 11-217V1). NOTE: Screen height requirements for
      departures depend on the agency that wrote the departure and/or the airfield where the
      departure is being flown. There is no standard or easy way for crews to determine screen
      height requirements. Therefore, when using departures other than those listed below, or
      when any doubt exists about which screen height to use, plan to cross the DER at 35 feet
      (minimum) unless you can ascertain a different screen height requirement from an
      appropriate authority.
         6.16.2.2.1. Special Departure Procedure: Published on SDP. NOTE: Screen height
         requirements are built into the SDP, no further calculation of screen height is
         required.
         6.16.2.2.2. USAF/USN non-joint-use airfields: Zero feet unless published otherwise.
         6.16.2.2.3. Other than   USAF/USN         non-joint-use  airfields         (Civil/Joint
         Use/ICAO/NATO/etc.): 35 feet unless published otherwise.
      6.16.2.3. Aircraft must meet the published climb gradient for the departure runway with
      all engines operating. If no minimum climb gradient is published, 200 ft/nm will be used.
      NOTE: In the event the aircraft is unable to meet the published ALL ENGINE climb
      gradient, download cargo/fuel or delay until more favorable conditions exist.
      6.16.2.4. Use one of the following methods to ensure the aircraft can vertically clear all
      obstacles along the planned departure route with OEI. For the purposes of OEI departure
      planning, AMC/A3 and 18 AF/CC, as the operations supervisors (equivalent mission
      execution authority supervisor), deem all 618 AOC (TACC) and CVAM tasked missions
      as ‘operationally necessary’.
         6.16.2.4.1. An ‘operational’ mission is defined as all missions that are not designated
         as training specific missions. A training mission may be considered ‘operational’ if
         external users (e.g. tanker/receiver AAR training, cargo load training, JA/ATT, etc.)
         are scheduled as part of the training mission. For all missions not deemed
         ‘operational’ (local training sorties); the operations supervisor will be the mission
         execution authority supervisor, e.g. the OG/CC, or equivalent, delegated no lower
         than Sq/DO.
         6.16.2.4.2. Special Departure Procedure (SDP). SDPs are MDS-specific OEI escape
         procedures intended only for emergency use. They are applicable after the loss of an
         engine and, where available, will be used for engine-out departure planning when
         operationally necessary. Retrieve current SDPs from the SDP website (contact OGV
         for current username password). ‘Ad hoc’ requests for fields not currently listed may
         be requested through OGV NLT 48 hrs prior to scheduled departure. AMC/A3VX
         authorizes the use of Ad Hoc SDPs for a maximum of 7 days after the analysis date.
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                             215


              6.16.2.4.3. Minimum climb gradient. The TERPS standard minimum climb gradient
              is 200 ft/nm, which is based on the standard obstacle clearance surface (OCS) of 152
              ft/nm plus the required obstacle clearance (ROC) of 48 ft/nm. If an SDP is not
              available, the crew must ensure compliance with any obstacle-based minimum climb
              gradients for the selected departure, with one-engine inoperative. Minimum climb
              gradients may be published as a ‘Trouble T’ restriction in the IFR Take-off
              Minimums section of FLIP or on a SID. When operationally necessary, crews may
              subtract 48’/nm from published climb gradients before computing engine-out takeoff
              data. Minimum climb gradients do not take into account low, close in obstacles
              (obstacles or terrain 200’ AGL and below) which should normally be published as a
              note on the SID or IFR departure procedure (Trouble T). Crews must also ensure the
              aircraft can vertically clear low close-in obstacles along the planned departure path.
              NOTE: If OEI obstacle clearance cannot be satisfied by one of the above methods,
              download cargo/fuel or delay until more favorable conditions exist.

 MISSION         VIS        REMARKS


 Operational 1000           When less than RVR 1600, but equal to or greater than RVR 1000, the
             RVR            crew may take off if mission priority dictates, provided the runway has
                            dual RVR readouts and displays (minimum RVR 1000 on both) and
                 (305
                            runway centerline lighting is operational. For any takeoff below 1600
                 meters)
                            RVR, the crew must be fully qualified.




 All others      1600       For runways with more than one operating RVR readout, RVR must
                            read 1600 minimum on all.
                 RVR
                 (488
                 Meters)


 NOTES:
 If no RVR readout is available for the departure runway, visibility must be reported to be 1/2
 mile (800 meters). When weather is below approach and landing minimums (ceiling or
 visibility) a takeoff alternate is required (See paragraph 6.19.)

6.18. Alternate Planning. Select alternate airports meeting the requirements of AFI 11-202V3.
Choose alternates that best meet mission requirements and conserve fuel; they should not be
within the same terminal area, if terminal forecasts are marginal. Select alternates that are not
 216                                               AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


restricted by FLIP, FCG, or diplomatic clearances, and are compatible with the mission load and
performance characteristics of the aircraft. The PIC retains final authority in the choice of
alternates; however, selection by support agencies normally should be used if they meet the
above criteria and the aircraft has already been serviced. Refer to chapter 14 for fuel planning
guidance.
6.19. Departure Alternates.
   6.19.1. A departure alternate is required if weather is below landing minimums for lowest
   suitable approach (at departure aerodrome) or if crosswinds (corrected for RCR) are out of
   limits for landing. If planning an ILS approach, Category I minimums will be used.
   6.19.2. Suitability of Departure Alternates. When a departure alternate is required, the
   aircraft must be capable of maintaining the MEA or minimum obstruction clearance altitude
   (MOCA), whichever is higher, to the alternate using OEI performance criteria. To qualify as
   a departure alternate, the airfield must meet one of the following conditions:
       6.19.2.1. For an alternate within 30 minutes flying time, the existing weather must be
       equal to or better than the published approach minimums and forecast to remain so until 1
       hour after takeoff, but in no case forecast to be lower than 200-1/2 (RVR 2400), or;
       6.19.2.2. For an alternate within two hours flying time, the existing weather must be at
       least 500-1 above the lowest compatible published approach minimums, but not less than
       600-2 for a precision approach or 800-2 for a non-precision approach, and forecast to
       remain so for 1 hour after ETA at the alternate.
6.20. Destination Requirements (for filing purposes). Refer to chapter 14 for fuel planning
guidance. The forecast destination weather will be according to AFI 11-202V3 and the
following:
   6.20.1. File two alternates when:
       6.20.1.1. The forecast visibility (intermittent or prevailing) is less than published for the
       available DoD or National Aeronautical Charting Office (NACO) precision approach; or
       6.20.1.2. The forecast ceiling OR visibility (intermittent or prevailing) is less than
       published for all other approaches. For approaches with no published ceiling requirement
       (e.g. Jeppesen approaches), the minimum required ceiling shall be computed by taking
       the published HAA or HAT and rounding it up to the nearest one hundred feet (or as
       determined by MAJCOM TERPs review). For example, a Jeppesen VOR approach with a
       published HAA of 642 feet would require a forecasted ceiling of 700 feet; or
       6.20.1.3. The forecast surface winds (intermittent or prevailing) exceed limits corrected
       for RCR.
   6.20.2. File an alternate, regardless of forecast weather, when the departure or destination
   aerodrome is outside the CONUS. EXCEPTION: OCONUS, intra-theater flights that do not
   exceed 3-hours, comply with basic AFI 11-202V3.
   6.20.3. When filing to a remote or island destination, aircrews may use 2+00 holding fuel (in
   lieu of an alternate). A remote or island destination is defined as any aerodrome, which due
   to its unique geographic location, offers no suitable alternate (civil or military) within 2 hours
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                           217


   flying time. The forecast weather at the remote or island destination must meet the following
   criteria:
      6.20.3.1. The prevailing surface winds, corrected for RCR, must be within limits at ETA
      and forecast to remain so for 2 hours thereafter, and
      6.20.3.2. The prevailing ceiling and visibility must be equal to or greater than published
      minimums for an available non-precision approach, for ETA plus 2 hours. However, if a
      precision approach is available, the ceiling or visibility may be intermittently below non-
      precision approach minimums (excluding ASR), but not below precision approach
      minimums (for ETA plus 2 hours). NOTE: See Chapter 14 for fuel planning
      considerations to a remote or island destination.
6.21. Adverse Weather.
   6.21.1. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe turbulence is prohibited.
      6.21.1.1. The C-5 is a category II aircraft for turbulence. Crews should confirm the type
      of aircraft the forecast turbulence applies to, or what type of aircraft reported the
      encounter, to gain a more accurate picture for their route of flight. Turbulence category
      charts are found in Air Force Weather Agency technical note AFWA/TN 98/002,
      Meteorological Techniques.
      6.21.1.2. The PIC is responsible for ensuring all passengers are seated, with seat belts
      fastened, when areas of moderate or greater turbulence are encountered or anticipated.
      WARNING: Serious injury may occur if passengers do not have their seat belts fastened
      and the aircraft encounters moderate or severe turbulence.
   6.21.2. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe icing is prohibited. Prolonged
   operation, such as cruise flight or holding, in areas of moderate icing should be avoided.
      6.21.2.1. Do not takeoff under conditions of freezing rain or freezing drizzle. NOTE:
      Air Force Weather Agency technical note AFWA/TN 98/002, Meteorological
      Techniques, states that freezing drizzle is equivalent to moderate icing and freezing rain
      is equivalent to severe icing. When freezing fog is forecast or reported, aircrews will
      confirm with weather agencies what type (if any) icing is associated with the freezing
      fog.
      6.21.2.2. Freezing precipitation, snow, freezing fog, or temperatures near 0°C, may cause
      ice or frost to accumulate on aircraft surfaces. When an aircraft requires de-icing/anti-
      icing prior to takeoff, refer to the following:
      6.21.2.2. (439AW) Before leaving the aircraft overnight, the stabilizer trim will be set to
      full nose down position (bullet up), flaps and slats retracted.
          6.21.2.2.1. Aircrews will only use de-ice and anti-ice fluids listed in their respective
          flight manual. Aircrews will be familiar with and follow all restrictions in their
          associated flight manual with respect to anti-ice/de-ice procedures and holdover
          times.
          6.21.2.2.2. MIL-A-8243 Type I and Type II de-icing fluids provide little anti-icing
          benefit, and therefore have limited holdover times. As a guide, for approved anti-
          icing fluids, crews may use published anti-icing holdover times IAW TO 42C-1-2,
218                                              AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


         Aircraft Anti-icing Procedures, and AFFSA holdover tables located at the AFFSA
         website. The holdover time begins when anti-icing fluid is first applied and the PIC
         shall use time, temperature, and dilution of mixture to determine when times are
         exceeded and re-apply fluid if required.
         6.21.2.2.3. In all cases, PICs will ensure a visual inspection of the aircraft is
         completed within 5 minutes of departure.
         6.21.2.2.4. (Added-439AW) APUs will be shut down prior to deicing in and around
         the APUs.
  6.21.3. Do not fly directly above (within 2,000 feet) thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds.
  If unable to vertically clear thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds by at least 2000 feet,
  avoid them by at least:
      6.21.3.1. 20 NMs at or above flight level FL 230.
      6.21.3.2. 10 NMs below FL230.
      6.21.3.3. 5 NMs for tactical low-level operations below FL230 provided the outside air
      temperature is at or above 0°C at flight altitude. Avoid gust fronts and winds preceding a
      rapidly moving thunderstorm. CAUTION: Aircraft damage may occur 20NMs or more
      from any thunderstorms. Aircrews must familiarize themselves with information on
      thunderstorm development and hazards. Refer to AFH 11-203, Weather for Aircrews.
  6.21.4. The use of ground-based radar as a means of thunderstorm avoidance should only be
  used to assist in departing an inadvertently penetrated area of significant weather. It should
  never be considered a normal avoidance procedure. When relying exclusively on ground-
  based radar for weather avoidance, and the ground controller is unable to provide avoidance
  instructions, attempt to maintain VMC by:
      6.21.4.1. Changing routing.
      6.21.4.2. Diverting to alternate.
      6.21.4.3. Declaring an emergency and requesting priority assistance.
  6.21.5. Aircrews should avoid flying in areas of recently dissipated thunderstorms and
  advected clouds (horizontal movement of clouds caused by wind) downwind of
  thunderstorms.
  6.21.6. In order to minimize exposure to thunderstorm hazards when approaching or
  departing an airport in an area where thunderstorms are occurring or are forecast:
      6.21.6.1. Attempt to maintain VMC.
      6.21.6.2. Maintain at least 5NMs separation from heavy rain showers
      6.21.6.3. Avoid areas of high lightning potential, i.e., clouds within plus or minus 5,000
      feet of the freezing level or plus or minus 8°C of the freezing level. NOTE: Approaches
      or departures may be accomplished when thunderstorms are within 10NMs providing
      they are not producing any hazardous conditions (such as hail, lightning, strong winds,
      gusts fronts, heavy rain, wind shear, or microburst) at the airport, and are not forecast or
      observed to be moving in the direction of the route of flight (to include the planned
      missed approach corridor, if applicable).
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                             219


   6.21.7. When performing approaches and landings at locations where temperatures are 0°C
   or below, refer to AFI 11-202V3 and the Flight Information Handbook (FIH) Section D,
   Temperature Correction Chart, to correct MDA, DA, and other barometric altitudes inside
   the FAF. When Temperature is below -30C or if in mountainous terrain apply correction to
   all altitudes on the approach plate.
   6.21.8. Do not fly into an area of known or forecast moderate or greater mountain wave
   turbulence. Refer to AFH 11-203v1 and AFH 11-203v2, Weather for Aircrews, for
   additional information on mountain wave turbulence.
   6.21.9. Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET). National Weather Service in-
   flight weather advisories are not limiting to Air Force aircraft. Contact the nearest military
   weather facility or flight service station for details, if applicable.
   6.21.10. Volcanic Dust Precautions. Aircraft flight operations in areas of forecast or known
   volcanic activity or dust is prohibited. Plan all missions to avoid volcanic activity by at least
   20 NMs.
       6.21.10.1. Crews that are planned to fly through or divert through predicted low density
       area will fill out the “low density volcanic ash aircrew worksheet” as soon as conditions
       permit and turn in the form to MX during debrief, or to the first available MX technician
       if at an en route location, at first opportunity. MX will use this worksheet to update G081
       to determine additional aircraft inspection requirements and track long term effects. Only
       use AFTO Form 781 write-ups for actual or suspected ash penetration. The worksheets
       will be made available with the aircraft forms prior to flight and will be filled out at the
       earliest opportunity, during flight if possible.
   6.21.11. Lightning Avoidance. The following conditions are most conducive to lightning
   strikes and prolonged flight in them should be avoided:
       6.21.11.1. Within 8C of freezing level.
       6.21.11.2. In clouds or in any intensity of precipitation or turbulence associated with
       thunderstorm activity.
6.22. Operational Risk Management (ORM). ORM is a logic based, common sense approach
to making calculated decisions on human, material, and environmental factors before, during,
and after all operations. USAF policy on ORM is contained in Air Force Policy Directive 90-9,
Operational Risk Management. PICs will accomplish ORM worksheets IAW MAJCOM and
local guidance as part of preflight activities.
   6.22.1. Flying units will develop a local ORM program to include personal ORM assessment
   for all missions and accomplished by all crewmembers prior to each flight. The ORM
   worksheet is a living document and aircrews should update their risk factors as their mission
   evolves to ensure an accurate risk assessment.

Section 6C—Preflight

6.23. Hazard Identification and Mitigation. If not previously briefed in the Specialized
Briefing, refer to paragraph 6.12.3., the PIC will brief primary mission hazards facing the crew
during takeoff and climb-out, after the entire crew is assembled at the aircraft.
 220                                             AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


6.24. AFTO Forms 781 Series.
   6.24.1. Review AFTO Forms 781 series before applying power to the aircraft or operating
   aircraft systems. An exceptional release must be signed before flight. A maintenance officer,
   maintenance superintendent, or authorized civilian normally signs the exceptional release. If
   one of these individuals is not available, the PIC may sign the exceptional release. Ensure
   that the DD Form 1896, Jet Fuel Identaplate, and AIR card are aboard the aircraft.
   6.24.2. One-Time Flights. An aircraft may be released for a one-time flight with a condition
   that might be hazardous for continued use, provided the aircraft is airworthy for one flight to
   another station. Refer to T.O. 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection,
   Documentation, Policies, and Procedures, for downgrade authority and procedures. After the
   maintenance release is obtained, coordinate mission requirements with the controlling
   agency. The PIC’s concurrence is required before the aircraft can be flown.
   6.24.3. For Red X clearing procedures at stations without maintenance support refer to
   paragraph 12.3
6.25. Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations.
   6.25.1. Aircraft Refueling. Aircrew members are normally not required to refuel or defuel
   aircraft; however, crewmembers qualified in ground refueling/defueling may perform these
   duties. When crewmembers are required to refuel/defuel, the flight engineer will act as the
   team supervisor. Aircrews will only refuel/defuel in cases when maintenance support is not
   readily available and the mission would be delayed. Crewmembers may augment
   maintenance refueling teams at en route stops. If required, the PIC will designate other
   crewmembers to assist the flight engineer. Crewmembers will comply with T.O. 00-25-172,
   applicable maintenance T.O.s, and refueling/defueling checklists.
   6.25.2. Aircrew Dash One Preflight Inspection Requirements. Accomplish IAW the flight
   manual.
       6.25.2.1. (Added-439AW) Use the Spare Aircraft Preflight procedures contained in
       Attachment 3 for preflighting and sealing of aircraft for other than ALFA Standby.
   6.25.3. Fire Protection and Crash Rescue.
       6.25.3.1. The aircraft engine fire extinguisher system fulfills the minimum requirements
       for fire protection during engine start.
       6.25.3.2. A fireguard is required for all engine starts including the APU. A crewmember
       or ground controller may act as fireguard.
   6.25.4. Aircrew and Maintenance Engine Runs.
       6.25.4.1. Aircrew are authorized to perform engine runs when qualified maintenance
       personnel are not available. A mixture of aircrew and maintenance personnel is not
       recommended, if possible use all aircrew. When an aircrew member is required to start or
       run up engines for maintenance purposes, the following procedures apply:
          6.25.4.1.1. Maintenance personnel will accomplish all necessary inspections and
          preparations for the engine run. These actions include but are not limited to:
          intake/exhaust inspections, access panel security servicing, and AFTO Form 781
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                           221


           documentation. C-5M only: The EDS must be on and configured for RMM data
           collection for all engine starts/runs.
           6.25.4.1.2. Use only aircrew checklists. Begin with the "before starting engines"
           checklist and complete all appropriate checklists in their entirety through the "before
           leaving airplane" checklist.
           6.25.4.1.3. Checklist deviations are authorized when maintenance requires less than
           four engines to be started.
           6.25.4.1.4. Operate symmetrical engines when power settings above ground idle are
           required.
6.26. Aircraft Recovery Away from Home Station. Refer to Chapter 12 for procedures.
6.27. Aircrew Flight Equipment Requirements.
   6.27.1. Oxygen. The minimum quantity of oxygen aboard an aircraft before takeoff must be
   sufficient to accomplish the planned flight from the equal time point (ETP) to recovery
   should oxygen be required.      Calculate using the Crew Regulators Oxygen 100% and
   Passenger Continuous Flow portions of the Oxygen Duration Chart in the flight manual.
       6.27.1.1. Aircrew members will comply with the oxygen requirements in AFI 11-202V3.
       6.27.1.2. Crewmembers occupying a crew station will have an oxygen mask connected
       and readily available for use from before engine start until engine shutdown.
   6.27.2. Rafts. On overwater flights do not carry more passengers and crewmembers than the
   life rafts will accommodate.
   6.27.3. Life preserver units (LPUs) or Personal Floatation Device. The loadmaster will
   place an LPU within easy reach of each passenger and aircrew member before takeoff on
   overwater flights (outside gliding distance to land). Ensure the appropriate number and type
   of life preservers are aboard for overwater missions carrying children and infants.
6.28. Fleet Service. Ensure the required fleet service items are aboard the aircraft early enough
to permit inventory prior to engine start.
6.29. Cargo Documentation. Proper cargo or mail documentation will accompany each load.
   6.29.1. Load Data Information (Applicable to AFRC/ANG completing 618 AOC [TACC]-
   directed missions). At stations where there is no mobility air transportation function, the
   aircrew will collect the required load information on each leg, and submit it to the first
   station, which has such a function. The report will be submitted on AF Form 4075, Aircraft
   Load Data Worksheet.
6.30. Airlifting Hazardous Cargo. NOTE: Installed flares do not constitute hazardous cargo.
However, any additional loads of flares are not considered aircraft equipment and shall be
properly packaged and prepared IAW AFMAN 24-204.
   6.30.1. AMCH 11-214, AMC Aircrew Hazardous Material Handbook, contains a description
   of the types and classes of hazardous cargo that may be carried. AMC and AMC-gained PICs
   are responsible for ensuring that all procedures contained in AMCH 11-214 are complied
   with when airlifting hazardous cargo.
 222                                              AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


       6.30.1.1. For more information regarding hazardous materials, refer to AFMAN 24-204,
       Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipment.
   6.30.2. Flight Planning. Based on the Hazardous Cargo Briefing and IAW AMCH 11-214
   Chapter 7, the PIC will:
       6.30.2.1. Enter "Hazardous Cargo" and the mission identifier or flight number in the
       appropriate section of the flight plan. Use Remarks section of DD175, Military Flight
       Plan, and Other Information section of DD1801, International Flight Plan, DOD. Refer
       to the FCG for country specific requirements concerning over-flight when transporting
       hazardous materials cargo.
       6.30.2.2. If possible, plan the flight to minimize overflying heavily populated or
       otherwise critical areas. Approach, landing, and takeoff tracks are excluded.
       6.30.2.3. Prepare a departure message at stations when a C2 center is not available. The
       remarks section of the departure message will include: Class of hazardous material, DoD
       class or division for explosives, net explosive weight (NEW), and gross weight. If
       required, request special handling (e.g., isolated parking, security, technical escort teams,
       etc.).
       6.30.2.4. If estimated time en route (ETE) is less than 1 hour, or if other circumstances
       preclude timely message receipt at destination, notify the next destination of the ETA and
       information listed in paragraph 6.30.2.3. If available, C2 will relay required information
       to next destination.
6.31. Handling of Classified Cargo, Registered Mail, Mission Capable (MICAP) Parts,
Very, Very Important Part (VVIP), Forward Supply System (FSS) Shipments, and Courier
Material.
   6.31.1. MICAP, VVIP, sensitive cargo, courier materials, and registered mail moving within
   the normal airlift system are receipted at the on and offload stations using the air cargo
   manifest. For unit moves operated in accordance with Defense Transportation Regulation
   (DTR), Part III, Mobility, classified or sensitive cargo movement is normally manifested
   utilizing the DD Form 2130-1, C-5 Load Plan, or similar automated product (such as CALM
   or AALPS), and will normally be accompanied by a unit courier. However, if
   classified/sensitive unit cargo is offered without an accompanying courier, the DD Form
   1907, Signature and Tally Record, must be used.
       6.31.1.1. Defense Courier Service (DCS) couriers coordinating with the PIC are
       authorized to designate officer or enlisted, (E-5 and above) crewmembers on military
       aircraft as couriers to escort and safeguard courier material when other qualified
       personnel are not available. Qualified passengers, if carried, are designated before
       designating crewmembers. The following restrictions apply:
          6.31.1.1.1. Primary crewmembers will not be designated couriers without the consent
          of the PIC.
          6.31.1.1.2. Crewmembers on aircraft scheduled to make an extended en route stop at
          a location where DCS couriers cannot provide en route support will not be designated
          as couriers.
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                             223


   6.31.2. During stops at en route locations supported by DCS stations, DCS couriers are
   required to meet designated couriers, guard and protect the material.
       6.31.2.1. During unscheduled en route stops crewmembers may place courier material in
       temporary custody of the following agencies in descending order of priority.
           6.31.2.1.1. DCS courier.
           6.31.2.1.2. TOP SECRET control officer of the US armed forces.
           6.31.2.1.3. US Department of State Diplomatic Courier.
           6.31.2.1.4. US Department of State activity.
           6.31.2.1.5. US military guards.
           6.31.2.1.6. US DoD civilian guards.
   6.31.3. If unable to follow the itinerary to the destination of the courier material, or material
   is lost, stolen or otherwise compromised, report circumstances to the nearest Defense Courier
   Station and notify the local US military commander or US Government activity.
   6.31.4. Life or death urgency shipments consist of biological or other medical supplies of
   such urgency that human life is dependent upon immediate receipt. Shipments will be
   manifested separately and the manifest annotated with the words LIFE OR DEATH
   URGENCY. All shipments will be handled on a hand-to-hand receipt basis, using either the
   air cargo manifest or the DD Form 1907, for unit moves. The PIC, or designated
   representative, will be briefed on the urgency of the shipment and be made the custodian
   during flight.

Section 6D—Departure

6.32. On Time Takeoffs. Mission departures are on time if the aircraft is airborne within -
20/+14 minutes of scheduled takeoff time or as specified in a MAJCOM supplement.
   6.32.1. Scheduled takeoff time may be adjusted to make good a time over target (TOT), Air
   Refueling Control Time (ARCT), or time of arrival (TOA). PICs shall notify C2 agency
   before takeoff to adjust the scheduled takeoff time.
   6.32.2. Early Departures. Early departures are authorized to prevent a delay due to weather,
   ATC restrictions, airfield or aircraft operational limitations, to adjust mission flow during a
   large-scale operation, or if approved through C2 channels provided the impact on local and
   downrange facilities and crew duty is evaluated.
6.33. Not Used.

Section 6E—En route

6.34. Flight Progress. In-flight, use all available navigational aids to monitor FMS
performance. Immediately report malfunctions or any loss of navigation capability that degrades
centerline accuracy to the controlling air route traffic control center (ARTCC). Use the following
procedures for flight progress:
224                                              AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


  6.34.1. Another pilot will verify waypoint data inserted into the INS/FMS. Check both the
  coordinate information and the distances between waypoints against the flight plan.
  6.34.2. Operations in International/Territorial Airspace. (See FLIP, FCG, NAT Doc 007, and
  AP, for further guidance). US military aircraft and DoD personnel entering another nation to
  conduct US government business must have the approval of the foreign government
  concerned to enter their airspace. Foreign clearances for US international air operations are
  obtained through US officials known as Defense Attaché Officers (DAOs).
      6.34.2.1. There are essentially two types of airspace: international airspace and territorial
      airspace. International airspace includes all airspace seaward of coastal states' territorial
      seas. Military aircraft operate in such areas free of interference or control by the coastal
      state. Territorial airspace includes airspace above territorial seas, archipelagic waters,
      inland waters, and land territory, and is sovereign airspace. Overflight may be conducted
      in such areas only with the consent of the sovereign country.
      6.34.2.2. Consistent with international law, the US recognizes sea claims up to 12NMs.
      Diplomatic constraints and/or a lack of diplomatic clearances usually result in missions
      operating in international airspace. Therefore, it is imperative sufficient information be
      provided far enough in advance to allow compliance with FCG requirements established
      by the countries concerned. The US does not normally recognize territorial claims
      beyond 12NMs; however, specific guidance from certain US authorities may establish
      limits, which differ from the standard.
      6.34.2.3. Flight Information Region (FIR). An FIR is an area of airspace within which
      flight information and related services are provided. An FIR does not reflect international
      borders or sovereign airspace. Aircraft may operate within an established FIR without
      approval of the adjacent country, provided the AC avoids flight in territorial airspace.
      6.34.2.4. Aircrews on a flight plan route which takes them from international airspace
      into territorial airspace for which approved aircraft clearances were obtained should not
      amend entry point(s).
      6.34.2.5. Violations of foreign sovereignty result from unauthorized or improper entry or
      departure of aircraft. Aircrews should not enter into territorial airspace for which a
      clearance has not been duly requested and granted through diplomatic channels.
      6.34.2.6. ATC agencies are not vested with authority to grant diplomatic clearances for
      penetration of sovereign airspace where prior clearance is required from the respective
      country. Aircraft clearances are obtained through diplomatic channels only.
      6.34.2.7. In the event ATC agency challenges the validity of a flight routing or attempts
      to negate existing clearances, ACs must evaluate the circumstances. The normal response
      will be to attempt to advise the ATC agency that the aircraft will continue to planned
      destination, as cleared in international airspace. The key phrase is "in international
      airspace." Safety of flight is paramount in determining mission continuation. Under no
      circumstances should aircrews construe a clearance, which routes their mission over
      sovereign airspace, which was not approved through diplomatic channels before mission
      departure, as being valid authorization.
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                              225


       6.34.2.8. Aircrews operating missions requiring unique or specially developed routing
       will normally be briefed at home station, onload station, and/or by the last C2 facility
       transited before performing the critical portion of the mission.
       6.34.2.9. Aircrews (except on weather reconnaissance missions) normally are not tasked
       to and should not fly "due regard" routings unless coordinated with the appropriate
       MAJCOM C2 and specifically directed in the mission FRAG. The "due regard" or
       "operational" option obligates the military AC to be their own ATC agency to separate
       their aircraft from all other air traffic. If operational requirements dictate, ACs may
       exercise the "due regard" option to protect their aircraft. Aircraft will return to normal air
       traffic services as soon as practical.
6.35. In-Flight Meals. Pilots should not eat meals at the same time, and their meals should
consist of different menu items.
6.36. Communications Instructions Reporting Vital Intelligence Sightings and Other
Reports. Report all vital intelligence sightings from aircraft as indicated in FLIP planning or
FLIP En route Supplement.
   6.36.1. In-flight harassment or hostile action against aircraft. Aircraft subjected to
   harassment or hostile action by foreign aircraft will immediately contact the nearest USAF
   air and ground voice facility and report the encounter. Include aircraft nationality, type,
   insignia, or any other identifying features; note position, heading, time, speed when harassed,
   and the type of harassment. Request relay of the report to the nearest C2 agency. Also,
   attempt to contact the nearest command post when in UHF and VHF range.
   6.36.2. Other incidents will be reported as indicated in JCS Pub 6V5 and AFI 10-206,
   Operational Reporting.
6.37. Communications.
   6.37.1. Crews will conduct an HF radio ground check before takeoff if use of the HF radio
   may be required for ATC or C2 communications. Attempt to establish HF contact before
   going out of UHF/VHF range. If unable to establish HF contact with the controlling HF
   station, and an alternate means of relay of ATC information is not available, the aircraft
   should return to the nearest suitable support base. In the case of airborne HF failure, crews
   are authorized to continue under the following conditions:
       6.37.1.1. If SATCOM-equipped use Satellite Voice Communications to contact
       responsible station via special telephone numbers/short codes published in State AIPs
       (Aeronautical Information Publication).
       6.37.1.2. If not SATCOM-equipped, attempt to contact ATC facility on VHF or attempt
       VHF relay via another aircraft on 123.45 MHz.
   6.37.2. Pilots shall provide ARTCC position and weather observations when required. If
   unable to contact an ATC agency, attempt to relay through the GLOBAL HF stations.
6.38. In-Flight Emergency Procedures. The PIC shall report deviations from directives that
may occur as a result of an emergency according to AFI 11-202V3. Time and conditions
permitting, inform passengers of the situation and intentions.
 226                                               AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


   6.38.1. Notification of Control Agencies. When practical after completing the aircraft
   emergency action checklists and associated actions, the PIC shall furnish ATC and
   appropriate C2 agencies with a description of the difficulty, assistance required, intentions,
   and any other pertinent information.
   6.38.2. The PIC may initiate a CONFERENCE HOTEL/SKYHOOK when additional
   expertise is necessary. Communications procedures are as follow:
       6.38.2.1. Local Area. Use appropriate UHF or VHF frequencies.
       6.38.2.2. En route. Attempt to establish a phone patch with the nearest or controlling C2
       Center using global HF network, UHF/VHF stations, SATCOM, etc. If unable, aircrews
       are permitted to use ARINC radio service as an additional avenue for phone patch
       connectivity.
       6.38.2.3. Provide the following information when time permits:
           6.38.2.3.1. Description of the situation to include actions taken and intentions.
           6.38.2.3.2. What assistance is being requested.
           6.38.2.3.3. Fuel on board and hours of endurance.
           6.38.2.3.4. Position.
           6.38.2.3.5. Altitude and flight conditions.
           6.38.2.3.6. Number of personnel and DVs on board.
           6.38.2.3.7. Qualification of PIC.
           6.38.2.3.8. Planned landing destination and ETA.
6.39. Need for Medical Assistance. When a person aboard the aircraft requires medical care,
the PIC will notify the station of intended landing in sufficient time so the aircraft may be met by
medical personnel. Notification will include the patient’s sex, approximate age, and major
complaint.
6.40. Weather Forecasts. It is the pilot’s responsibility to obtain destination weather prior to
descent. The primary sources are 618 AOC (TACC) weather operations, OWSs, and USAF
weather flights via pilot-to-meteorologist service (PMSV) or through a USAF aeronautical
station. For aircraft flying in EUCOM AOR (ENAME operations) contact USAFE/OWS at
Sembach AB GE. SOUTHCOM AOR contact 612 SPTS/WX at Davis-Monthan AFB, AZ. The
ATC system can provide weather information to en route aircraft.

Section 6F—Arrival

6.41. Descent. Before descent into unfamiliar areas, pilots will review appropriate terrain charts
to increase aircrew situational awareness of obstructions. Primary crewmembers will not be
involved in duties other than aircraft operations, descent and approach monitoring, and required
checklist items from the initial descent point to landing.
   6.41.1. Night and Marginal Weather Operations. Fly a precision approach, if available, at
   night or during marginal weather. If a precision approach is not available, fly any available
   approved instrument approach. A visual approach may be flown during night VFR conditions
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                             227


   if an approved instrument approach to the landing runway is not available or operational
   missions require a tactical approach. NOTE: A visual glide slope indicator, VASI, PAPI,
   etc., is required.
      6.41.1.1. On training/evaluation flights, pilots may fly non-precision approaches or VFR
      traffic patterns to accomplish required training and evaluations. The pilot not flying will
      monitor a precision approach when practical to enhance safety.
      6.41.1.2. For recovery at home station, pilots may elect to fly a visual or non-precision
      approach, if weather minimums permit.
6.42. Instrument Approach Procedures.
   6.42.1. Aircraft category. In FAA airspace, the C-5 is a category "D" aircraft. If approach
   speeds exceed 165 knots, the minimums for category "E" will be used. Consult appropriate
   FLIP and AFMAN 11-217v1 for ICAO categories.
   6.42.2. Prior to starting an instrument approach, pilots will confirm their aircraft can comply
   with the missed approach climb gradient requirements established in AFI 11-202V3.
   6.42.3. Weather minimums. Before starting an instrument approach, or beginning an en
   route descent, pilots will confirm the existing weather is reported to be:
      6.42.3.1. At or above required visibility for straight-in or sidestep approaches.
          6.42.3.1.1. For PAR approaches, visibility will be no lower than RVR 2400 (730
          meters) or 1/2 mile visibility (800 meters) with no RVR readout available and DA
          will be no lower than 200 feet HAT.
      6.42.3.2. At or above required ceiling and visibility for circling approaches.
          6.42.3.2.1. For circling approaches with no published ceiling requirement, the
          required ceiling shall be computed by taking the published HAA plus 100 feet
          rounded up to the next one hundred foot value (e.g., if the HAA is 747 feet, add 100
          feet to get 847 feet and then round up to the next one hundred foot value which would
          be 900 feet. Your ceiling for the approach must be at or above 900 feet.) When
          circling minimums are published, but not by category, circling approach minimums
          will be as published, but in no case lower than 600 feet and 2 miles visibility.
      6.42.3.3. Increase the published visibility minimums of an instrument approach by ½
      SM or as noted in NOTAMs, on ATIS, or on the approach plate, when the runway
      approach lighting system (ALS) is inoperative. (This applies only to the ALS itself, not to
      VASIs, PAPIs, and other lights that are not a component of the ALS.)
      6.42.3.4. If the ceiling is below the value depicted for published DoD or NACO
      precision approach, but visibility is at or above authorized minimums, comply with fuel
      requirements before initiating en route descent, penetration, or approach.
      6.42.3.5. Variable visibility/ceiling reports. If variable visibilities/ceilings are reported,
      pilots may use the greatest value reported. If it is subsequently determined that weather is
      below minimums for the approach, comply with paragraph 6.42.10. Do not attempt
      further approaches until the lowest visibility/ceiling reported is at/above approach
      minimums.
228                                            AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


  6.42.4. Not used.
  6.42.5. Category I ILS Procedures. Decision altitude for precision approaches will be as
  published, but no lower than 200 feet height above touchdown (HAT).
      6.42.5.1. ILS Precision Runway Monitor (PRM) Approaches. Both pilots must be
      certified to conduct an ILS PRM approach. Comply with the following operational
      procedures:
         6.42.5.1.1. Two operational VHF communication radios are required.
         6.42.5.1.2. The approach must be briefed as an ILS/PRM approach.
         6.42.5.1.3. If unable to accept an ILS PRM approach clearance, contact the FAA
         ATCSCC at 1-800-333-4286 prior to departure time to obtain a pre-coordinated
         arrival time. Pilots who arrive at a PRM airport unable to accept PRM approach
         clearance, who did not contact ATC prior to departure, should expect an ATC
         directed divert to a non-PRM airport.
         6.42.5.1.4. All breakouts from the approach shall be hand flown. Autopilots shall be
         disengaged when a breakout is directed.
         6.42.5.1.5. Should a TCAS Resolution Advisory (RA) be received, the pilot shall
         immediately respond to the RA. If following an RA requires deviating from an ATC
         clearance, the pilot shall advise ATC as soon as practical. While following an RA,
         comply with the turn portion of the ATC breakout instruction unless the pilot
         determines safety to be a factor.
  6.42.6. Category II ILS Procedures. DH is based on radar altitude. HAT may be no lower
  than 100 feet; however, published radar altimeter setting may be lower than 100 feet (to
  correspond with a 100 foot HAT). Minimum RVR is 1200. Maximum crosswind limitation is
  10 knots.
      6.42.6.1. The following airfield and aircraft equipment must be operational (AFI 11-230,
      Instrument Procedures).
         6.42.6.1.1. Approach lights.
         6.42.6.1.2. Runway centerline lighting.
         6.42.6.1.3. High intensity runway lights or touchdown zone lights.
         6.42.6.1.4. Two transmissometers when RVR is less than 1600.
         6.42.6.1.5. ILS far field monitor.
         6.42.6.1.6. Sequenced flashers.
         6.42.6.1.7. Both VHF NAV receivers.
         6.42.6.1.8. Both radar altimeters
         6.42.6.1.9. Autopilot and autoland sub-system (FMS-800 airplanes).
         6.42.6.1.10. Autopilot (For AMP airplanes category II approaches must be performed
         with the DUAL mode FMA displayed and coupled to the autopilot).
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                          229


       6.42.6.2. Aircrews will not execute an actual Category II ILS to minimums unless both
       pilots are qualified and current in Category II ILS. The PIC must have logged at least
       100 hours in command since AC certification.
   6.42.7. MLS Approaches. Conduct MLS approaches IAW AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-
   217V1.
   6.42.8. NDB Procedures. NDB approaches may be flown during day, night, or IMC
   conditions after compliance with any airfield restrictions in GDSS/GDSS2/ASRR. Back up
   each approach with available navaids/GPS to include loading the NDB coordinates in the
   FMS.
   6.42.9. RNAV Procedures. Properly trained C-5 aircrews are permitted to fly RNAV and
   RNAV (GPS) approaches. RNAV and RNAV (GPS) approaches will be flown only to
   LNAV minimums and IAW AFI 11-202V3.
       6.42.9.1. Traditional approaches (ILS, NDB, VOR, TACAN) found in DAFIF are not
       coded to the same standards as RNAV approaches. Due to the amount of errors,
       traditional approaches pulled from the DAFIF database may be flown solely via the FMS
       in day VMC only.
   6.42.10. After Beginning Descent or Approach. IAW AFI 11-202V3 Chapter 8, after
   beginning an en route descent or published approach, and the weather is reported or observed
   to be below approach minimums, the PIC has the option of continuing the approach to the
   missed approach point (MAP)/DA. Comply with the last assigned clearance until a new or
   amended clearance is received. EXCEPTION: Do not continue a CAT II ILS if the weather
   is reported to be below CAT II minima.
       6.42.10.1. Do not continue the approach below minimums unless the runway
       environment is in sight and the aircraft is in a position to make a safe landing.
       6.42.10.2. If the approach is continued, sufficient fuel must be available to complete the
       approach and missed approach, and proceed to a suitable alternate with normal fuel
       reserve.
       6.42.10.3. The PIC has final responsibility for determining when the destination is below
       designated minimums, and for initiating proper clearance request.
   6.42.11. Holding. An aircraft may hold at a destination that is below landing minimums, but
   forecast to improve to or above minimums provided:
       6.42.11.1. The aircraft has more fuel remaining than that required to fly to the alternate
       and hold for the appropriate holding time, and the weather at the alternate is forecast to
       remain at or above alternate filing minimums for the period, including the holding time.
       6.42.11.2. Destination weather is forecast to be at or above minimums before excess fuel
       will be consumed.
   6.42.12. Auto-land landings are prohibited.
6.43. Not Used.
6.44. Unscheduled Landings. When an unscheduled landing or crew rest occurs at a base
without a passenger facility, the PIC should immediately advise the appropriate C2 agency and
 230                                             AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


request assistance in arranging substitute airlift for passengers on board. The following
procedures apply when obtaining support for service members, in a group travel status, who are
transported on AMC aircraft flying a Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF) mission,
which incurs an unscheduled delay due to weather, aircraft maintenance, or foreign diplomatic
clearance problems, forcing the members to be lodged at that location until the aircraft can
continue its mission.
   6.44.1. If the delay is at a location where DoD facilities and AMC TWCF funds are
   available, payment for lodging (contract or on-base) and other required support is charged to
   local TWCF funds via the US Bancorp Government Purchase Card (GPC) account, in
   accordance with locally established procedures. TWCF payment is applicable for only those
   service members in a group travel status aboard any C-5 aircraft delayed at these locations,
   regardless of the command owning the aircraft, provided the aircraft is flying a TWCF
   mission (SAAM, CJCS Exercise, JA/ATT, or Contingency) with an AMC mission identifier.
   6.44.2. If the aircraft delay is at a location where TWCF funds are not available (regardless
   if DoD facilities are available or not), the aircraft commander will utilize SF 44, Purchase
   Order-Invoice-Vouchering (or AF IMT 15, United States Air Force Invoice) authority to
   acquire the necessary meals, quarters, and transportation for only the group travel status
   passengers. Upon return to home station, the aircraft commander will turn in the SF 44 or AF
   IMT 15 to the local accounting liaison/budget office. Supporting documentation should
   include a copy of the service members' group travel orders along with applicable
   invoices/receipts for lodging, meals, and other required support. Upon validation of the SF 44
   or AF IMT 15, the accounting liaison/budget office forwards the bills for these charges to the
   DFAS Field Site for payment, citing the funds of the unit whose aircraft incurred the delay.
   6.44.3. This policy does not apply to those passengers traveling on delayed aircraft flying
   TWCF missions who are authorized per diem on their individual travel orders or in a space
   available status.
6.45. Maintenance. Complete the AFTO Form 781 after each flight. After landing,
crewmembers debrief maintenance personnel on the condition of the aircraft, engines, avionics
equipment, and all installed special equipment as required. At stations without maintenance
support, when a maintenance requirement exists the PIC will ensure a thorough debrief is
provided to the C2 agency. On all AMC/ANG/AFRC missions, notify 618 AOC (TACC)
Logistics Control (618 AOC/XOCL).
   6.45.1. An entry will be placed in AFTO 781A, "Aircraft Subjected to Salt Spray" (state
   lowest altitude and duration) anytime the aircraft is flown under 1000 feet above sea except
   for takeoffs and landings.
6.46. Border Clearance.
   6.46.1. Normal Operations.
       6.46.1.1. The unit dispatching the mission is normally responsible for the border
       clearance of its aircraft.
       6.46.1.2. When support is not available, border clearance is the responsibility of the PIC.
       Duties may be assigned to ground personnel or to the loadmaster, but the PIC retains
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                        231


     ultimate responsibility. When a C-5 aircraft is on-loaded at a base without an air traffic
     function, the PIC is responsible for ensuring the following:
         6.46.1.2.1. Crewmembers, troops, and passengers possess current passports and valid
         visas, when required.
         6.46.1.2.2. Crewmembers, troops, and passengers have current certificates of
         immunization (shot record).
         6.46.1.2.3. Cargo entry documents are in proper order.
         6.46.1.2.4. Departing or entering the United States through a location where border
         clearance can be obtained.
         6.46.1.2.5. Obtaining border clearance for aircraft cargo, passengers, crew and
         baggage, if required, before takeoff to a foreign area or after arrival from a foreign
         area.
         6.46.1.2.6. Spraying the aircraft (see the FCG and paragraph 6.47).
  6.46.2. Procedures for US Entry.
     6.46.2.1. En route, the loadmaster will distribute personal customs declarations (when
     not accomplished by passenger services) to all passengers, troops, and crewmembers. The
     loadmaster will also brief passengers and crewmembers on customs regulations, and
     prepare and compile necessary border clearance forms for the PIC's signature.
     6.46.2.2. En route, notify the C2 agency at the base of intended landing of any change in
     ETA to ensure that border clearance is accomplished as soon as possible after landing.
     6.46.2.3. Obtain a permit to proceed when military necessities require that an aircraft,
     which has landed in the United States for customs clearance, to proceed to another base
     in the US to obtain border clearance. The permit to proceed delays customs inspection of
     cargo, passengers, and crew until arrival at the offload station, and saves intermediate
     offloading and reloading normally required for customs inspection. The permit to proceed
     is valid only to the airport of next landing where the border clearance must be completed
     or a new permit to proceed issued by a customs official. Do not make intermediate stops
     between the issue point of the permit to proceed and destination of manifested cargo
     unless required by an emergency or directed by the controlling C2 center.
     6.46.2.4. When an aircraft lands for a US border clearance, a US Customs representative
     normally will meet the aircraft to obtain the required documents. Do not deplane
     passengers, troops, or crewmembers unless necessary for safety or the preservation of life
     and property (scanner excepted). Do not unload until approved by customs and
     agriculture personnel or their designated representatives. This procedure applies to the
     initial landing in the US and all landings required when operating on a permit to proceed
     or until all crew, passengers, and cargo complete final border clearance.
  6.46.3. Inspections of U.S. Aircraft by Foreign Officials.
     6.46.3.1. Follow USAF policy on status of military aircraft as stated in the FCG, General
     Information (Chapter 3). In substance, this policy holds that US military aircraft are
     immune from searches, seizures, and inspections (including customs and safety
232                                              AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


      inspections) by foreign officials. In addition, PICs must be aware of, and adhere to, any
      specific FCG provisions for individual countries.
      6.46.3.2. If confronted with a search request by foreign authorities, aircrews should use
      the following procedures.
         6.46.3.2.1. In most cases, search attempts may be halted simply by a statement of the
         PIC to the foreign official that the aircraft is a sovereign instrumentality not subject to
         search without consent of USAF headquarters or the US Department of State officials
         in the country concerned. This should be clearly conveyed in a polite manner so as
         not to offend foreign authorities that may honestly, but mistakenly, believe they have
         authority to search USAF aircraft.
         6.46.3.2.2. If foreign authorities insist on conducting a search, the PIC should make
         every effort to delay the search until he or she can contact USAF headquarters
         (through MAJCOM C2) or the appropriate embassy officials. The PIC should then
         notify these agencies of foreign request by the most expeditious means available and
         follow their instructions.
         6.46.3.2.3. If foreign officials refuse to desist in their search request, pending
         notification to USAF headquarters or the appropriate embassy, the PIC should
         indicate that he or she would prefer to fly the aircraft elsewhere (provided fuel, flying
         time, and mechanical considerations permit a safe flight) and request permission to do
         so.
         6.46.3.2.4. If permission is refused and the foreign authorities insist on forcing their
         way on board an aircraft, the PIC should state that he protests the course of action
         being pursued and that he intends to notify both USAF headquarters and the
         appropriate American embassy of the foreign action. The PIC should not attempt
         physical resistance, and should thereafter report the incident to USAF headquarters
         and appropriate embassy as soon as possible. The PIC should escort foreign
         authorities if the inspection cannot be avoided.
      6.46.3.3. Other procedures may apply when carrying sensitive cargo or equipment.
      Follow these procedures and applicable portions of classified FCG supplements.
  6.46.4. Exercises and Contingency Operations.
      6.46.4.1. General. Certain airlift missions, which do not transit normal ports of entry or
      exit, require special procedures to expedite compliance with customs, public health,
      immunization, and agricultural requirements. A joint memorandum of understanding,
      between these agencies and MAJCOM establishes certain procedures and waivers.
      6.46.4.2. Implementation. Implementation of the agreement is not automatic. Traffic and
      border clearing agencies implement all or part of the agreement as necessary for each
      operation. Inspection and clearance may be accomplished at the US onload or offload
      base, or at the foreign onload or offload base.
      6.46.4.3. Customs Procedures.
         6.46.4.3.1. Outbound: No requirement. Filing of Customs Form 7507, General
         Declaration (Outward/Inward), is not required unless directed.
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                        233

               each passenger not under command of the troop commander, to include
               observers, support personnel, civilians, news reporters, and crewmembers.
               6.46.4.3.2.3.3. Upon arrival at a CONUS offload base, a customs
               representative will meet the aircraft and accept the troop commander's
               certificate with respect to troop baggage. Individual baggage declarations are
               not required. The troop commander should have inspected troop baggage.
               6.46.4.3.2.3.4. Troops will debark under the observation of the customs
               representative with only a spot check of articles and baggage. The customs
               officer may elect to make a more extensive inspection.
            6.46.4.3.2.4. For troops who are out of the country 140 days or more:
               6.46.4.3.2.4.1. One copy of the U.S. Customs Baggage Declaration Form for
               each passenger. This includes observers, support personnel, civilians, news
               media personnel, and crewmembers. Personnel may use DD Form 1854,
               Customs Accompanied Baggage, U.S., or Customs Form 6059B.
               6.46.4.3.2.4.2. Upon arrival at a CONUS offload base, a customs
               representative will meet the aircraft and collect all declarations. Troops will
               debark under the observation of the customs representative who may make
               discretionary examination of the baggage.
     6.46.4.4. Public Health Procedures.
        6.46.4.4.1. When operating from a base without a traffic officer, the AC will ensure
        all crewmembers and passengers are properly immunized.
        6.46.4.4.2. Spray the aircraft if required.
     6.46.4.5. Immigration Procedures.
        6.46.4.5.1. Outbound: No requirements.
        6.46.4.5.2. Inbound: Submit the following to the immigration inspector if carrying
        civilian passengers.
            6.46.4.5.2.1. One  copy         of        Customs   Form      7507   (found     at

              6.46.4.6.2.1. The command being airlifted will instruct troops that no fresh fruit,
              milk, milk products, vegetables, plants, plant pests, soil samples, animals, meat,
              and animal products can be brought into the United States. All items of troop
              personal gear/cargo are to be thoroughly cleaned of mud, dirt, sand, and other
              foreign material before being brought aboard the aircraft. Personal gear and
              equipment must be examined for snails and other plant pests to prevent their
              accidental entry into the U.S.
              6.46.4.6.2.2. Before loading, the command responsible for cargo being airlifted
              will clear vehicles and cargo of snails or other plant pests and of all mud and soil.
              6.46.4.6.2.3. When required by agricultural quarantine regulations, the FCG, or
              higher headquarters, the aircraft will receive an aerosol treatment 30 minutes
              before landing.
              6.46.4.6.2.4. On arrival, agricultural inspectors will inspect the aircraft after
              troops have disembarked. Crewmembers will assemble remains of in-flight
              lunches for prompt removal by fleet service personnel.
              6.46.4.6.2.5. Inspectors examine baggage, equipment, vehicles, and cargo as
              offloaded. Any items, vehicles, or cargo found to be contaminated will be held for
              such treatment as the inspector may direct (washing, steam cleaning, physical
              cleaning, or fumigation).
   6.46.5. Military Customs Pre-clearance Inspection Program. All crewmembers will ensure
   compliance with Military Customs Pre-clearance requirements.
6.47. Insect and Pest Control.
   6.47.1. Responsibility. PICs will ensure required spraying is accomplished according to
   AFJI 48-104, Quarantine Regulations of the Armed Forces, Department of Defense FCG, or
   as directed by higher headquarters. Certify the spraying on Customs Form 7507, or on forms
   provided by the country transited. Aircraft should never be sprayed with passengers on
   board. The only exception is when mandated by the FCG.
       6.47.1.1. When spraying is required, use insecticide, aerosol d-phenothrin-2 percent,
       National Stock Number (NSN) 6840-01-067-6674 (or equivalent), to spray the aircraft.
       Wear leather or Nomex gloves while spraying.
          6.47.1.1.1. Direct the nozzle toward the ceiling of the compartment or space being
          sprayed.
          6.47.1.1.2. Spray spaces inaccessible from within the aircraft after completely
          loading fuel, baggage, cargo, and passengers, including baggage compartments,
          wheel wells, and other similar spaces.
          6.47.1.1.3. Spray the cabin, cockpit, and other spaces accessible from within the
          aircraft after the crew is aboard and after closing all doors, windows, hatches, and
          ventilation openings. CAUTION: If the insecticide label directs disembarkation after
          use, spray before boarding crew or passengers. Close all doors and hatches for 10
          minutes after dispensing and ventilate for 15 minutes before allowing anyone on
          board.
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                            235


       6.47.1.2. Duration of spray will be according to Table 6.4 unless longer periods are
       specified for the country being transited. NOTE: Keep used aerosol cans separate from
       other trash so they may be disposed of safely.

Table 6.4. Spray Chart.

               Underfloor Compartment                 51

   6.47.2. Responsibility of PIC In-flight. When seeing any insect or rodent infestation of the
   aircraft in-flight, notify the destination C2 center, airfield management operations, or airport
   manager of the situation before landing so the proper authorities can meet the aircraft.
   6.47.3. Procedure at Aerial Port of Disembarkation (APOD). On arrival at an APOD, do not
   open cargo doors or hatches except to enplane officials required to inspect the aircraft for
   insect or rodent infestation. Do not onload or offload cargo or passengers until the inspection
   is satisfactorily completed. This procedure may be altered to satisfy mission or local
   requirements, as arranged by the base air terminal manager or the local C2 organization.

Section 6G—Miscellaneous

6.48. Dropped Objects. If an externally dropped object is discovered, the flight crew will:
   6.48.1. Notify TACC or the controlling agency as soon as practical; include details of
   routing, altitude, weather, etc.
   6.48.2. Notify maintenance at the first military station transited.
6.49. Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR). If involved in a mishap or incident, after landing and
terminating the emergency, pull the CVR power circuit breaker.
6.50. Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) and Dash 21 Equipment Documentation. The PIC
or designated representative will:
   6.50.1. Before departing home station or en route stations, ensure appropriate serviceable
   protective clothing, aircrew flight equipment, survival, and Dash 21 equipment for the entire
   or remainder of the mission are aboard the aircraft.
   6.50.2. Before departing home station and following en route crew changes, review AF
   Form 4076, Aircraft Dash 21 Equipment Inventory, to ensure all required Dash 21
   equipment has been certified as installed by maintenance, the initial check has been signed
   by maintenance, and configuration documents match mission requirements.
   6.50.3. Before departing home station and following en route crew changes, review, sign,
   and date the AFTO Form 46, Prepositioned Life Support Equipment, to ensure all required
   protective clothing and aircrew flight equipment and survival equipment have been certified
   as installed by Aircrew Flight Equipment personnel and that configuration documents match

   mission requirements. Ensure appropriate number and type of life preservers are aboard for
   over-water missions carrying children and infants.
   6.50.3. (439AW) The AFTO Form 46, Prepositioned Life Support Equipment and AF Form
   4076, Aircraft Dash 21 Equipment Inventory are located in the Aircraft 781 Forms binder.
   Ensure the inspection due date for all AFTO Form 46 will not expire prior to the scheduled
   mission return date.
       6.50.3.1. Anti-Exposure Suits. Any mission conducting operations North of 78 degrees
       and South of 60 degrees is required to carry anti-exposure suits.
   6.50.4. Missing Equipment. Aircrew members discovering equipment missing will
   accomplish the following:
       6.50.4.1. Make an AFTO Form 781A entry for equipment found missing. Additionally,
       ensure equipment removed from the aircraft at an en route station is documented in the
       AFTO Form 781A.
       6.50.4.2. Annotate AF Form 4076 and AFTO Form 46 in the next vacant column
       indicating the quantity remaining for the item. Ensure the ICAO location designator is
       entered above the check number of that column. Leave AF Form 4076 and AFTO Form
       46 on board the aircraft in the event of an en route crew change.
       6.50.4.3. Advise the PIC and determine whether the missing equipment should be
       recovered or replaced before mission continuation.
       6.50.4.4. Assist, as required, in preparing reports of survey for missing equipment.
       6.50.4.5. When possible, advise AMC/A3TL (or MAJCOM aircrew flight equipment
       office) and appropriate C2 agency (or airport management) before mission continuation.
   6.50.5. Additional Equipment. If more equipment is discovered during the preflight than is
   annotated on the AF Form 4076 or AFTO Form 46, annotate the total quantity in the next
   vacant column for the item. Ensure the ICAO location designator is entered above the check
   number of that column.
6.51. Passenger Restrictions.
   6.51.1. No-show passenger baggage or baggage of passengers removed from flight will be
   downloaded prior to departure. EXCEPTION: see paragraph 13.4.2.7
   6.51.2. The cargo compartment will not be used to airlift personnel, except by specific
   approval of AMC/A3.
6.52. Airfield Data Reports. Aircrews transiting unfamiliar airfields or airfields where
conditions may adversely affect subsequent flight will:
   6.52.1. Report airfield characteristics that produce illusions, such as runway length, width,
   slope, and lighting, as compared to standard runways, sloping approach terrain, runway
   contrast against surrounding terrain, haze, glare, etc., and previously unknown obstacles,
   airfield markings, or other safety critical items to AMC/A3AS.
   6.52.2. Debrief the next C2 center transited.

6.53. Impoundment of Aircraft. If an aircraft is involved in a serious in-flight incident, the
PIC should impound the aircraft immediately after landing IAW AFI 21-101, Aircraft and
Equipment Management, and contact the controlling C2 agency for further instructions.
6.54. Wake Turbulence Avoidance. Comply with wake turbulence avoidance criteria.
Acceptance of traffic information, instructions to follow an aircraft, or a visual approach
clearance is acknowledgment that the PIC will ensure takeoff and landing intervals and accepts
responsibility of providing wake turbulence separation. Refer to FLIP General Planning (GP) for
more information concerning wake turbulence separation.
6.55. Overflying En Route Stops. The C2 agency may approve a request to overfly a
scheduled en route stop (NGB/A3X for ANG-directed missions, AFRC command center for
AFRC-directed missions).
6.56. Classified Equipment and Material. Comply with the following or as directed in
MAJCOM supplement.
   6.56.1. Equipment. When classified equipment is onboard, ensure the C2 Center or airfield
   management operations office is aware of the requirement for aircraft security according to
   Chapter 7 of this AFI. At bases not under jurisdiction of the Air Force, ensure the aircraft and
   equipment are protected. AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management, provides
   specific guidance concerning the security of various levels of classified equipment aboard
   aircraft. For classified aircraft components which cannot be removed and stored, lock and
   seal the aircraft. If available, use Ravens to guard the aircraft; otherwise, use guards
   employed by the host country for flightline/airport area control. Do not leave unguarded
   classified information stored in navigation or radio equipment.
   6.56.2. Material. Ensure COMSEC and other classified materials are turned in at destination
   and receipts are obtained for COMSEC and classified material. The on-site C2 center will
   provide temporary storage for COMSEC and other classified materials during en route,
   turnaround, and crew rest stops. If a storage facility is not available, the aircraft gun storage
   box may be used for material classified up to and including SECRET. Encrypted COMSEC
   will only be transferred to authorized DoD personnel.
   6.56.3. Aircrews will ensure that they have an operable Mode 4 when required for mission
   accomplishment. Aircrews will conduct an operational ground test of the Mode 4(ground test
   assets permitting) before deployment overseas, or as specified in the OPORD or
   contingency/exercise tasking.
   6.56.4. Attempt to fix an inoperable Mode 4 before takeoff. Do not delay takeoff nor cancel
   a mission for an inoperable Mode 4, except when the aircraft will transit an area where safe
   passage procedures are implemented.
   6.56.5. Conduct an in-flight check of the Mode 4 on all missions departing the CONUS for
   overseas locations. Aircrews can request the Mode 4 interrogation check through NORAD on
   UHF 364.2.
   6.56.6. Aircraft with inoperable Mode 4 will continue to their intended destinations. Repairs
   will be accomplished at the first destination where equipment, parts, and maintenance
   technicians are available. In theaters where safe passage is implemented, aircraft will follow
 238                                                AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


   procedures for inoperable Mode 4 as directed in the applicable airspace control order or Air
   Tasking Order (ATO).
   6.56.7. Ground and in-flight checks of the Mode 4, when conducted, are mandatory
   maintenance debrief items. Crews will annotate successful and unsuccessful interrogation of
   the Mode 4 on all aircraft forms (AFTO Form781A).
   6.56.8. Aircrews will carry COMSEC equipment and documents required to operate the
   Mode 4 on missions when required for mission accomplishment. Before departing for any
   destination without COMSEC storage facilities, crews will contact their local COMSEC
   managers for guidance.
6.57. Cockpit Congestion and Loose Objects.
   6.57.1. Store only the minimum amount of professional gear required to accomplish the
   mission on the flight deck. Additional items will be secured in the crew rest area or the cargo
   compartment.
   6.57.2. Place only soft items on the top bunk.
   6.57.3. No items (checklists, charts, etc.) will be placed on the throttle quadrant or bogie
   emergency position switches.
6.58. Hung Ordnance Procedures. Conduct the following procedures after the live firing of
chaff/flares or the crew suspects aircraft battle damage:
   6.58.1. After landing, taxi to the de-arm area or another suitable safe location to check for
   hung ordnance.
   6.58.2. The scanner or another qualified crewmember will deplane the aircraft and check all
   chaff/flare dispensers for hung ordnance or damage. NOTE: ALE-40/47 flare squibs that fail
   to fire are not considered hung ordnance.
   6.58.3. If hung ordnance is found, identified by a protruding or partially ejected flare
   cartridge, the aircraft will remain in a de-arm area until Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD)
   personnel meet the aircraft. The aircraft must remain in the designated safe area until EOD
   personnel can clear all hung ordnance.
   6.58.4. If hung ordnance is not found, the aircraft can proceed to the parking location.

                                            Chapter 7

                                   AIRCRAFT SECURITY

7.1. General. This chapter provides guidance on aircraft security and preventing and resisting
aircraft piracy (hijacking) of the C-5 aircraft. AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft
Piracy (Hijacking)(FOUO), AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense (FOUO), and specific MAJCOM
security publications contain additional guidance. Aircrews will not release information
concerning hijacking attempts or identify armed aircrew members or missions to the public.
7.2. Security. The C-5 is a “Protection Level 3” resource. Aircraft security at non-United States
military installations is the responsibility of the controlling agency.
7.3. Integrated Defense. The following security procedures will implement AFI 31-101
requirements for C-5 aircraft:
   7.3.1. The aircraft will be parked in an established restricted area and afforded protection
   IAW AFI 31-101.
   7.3.2. When no permanent or established restricted area parking space is available, establish
   a temporary restricted area consisting of a raised rope barrier and post with restricted area
   signs. Portable security lighting will be provided during the hours of darkness if sufficient
   permanent lighting is not available. Post security forces IAW AFI 31-101.
   7.3.3. At non-United States military installations, the PIC determines the adequacy of local
   security capabilities to provide aircraft security commensurate with this chapter. If he or she
   determines security to be inadequate, the aircraft will depart to a station where adequate
   security is available.
   7.3.4. The security force must be made aware of all visits to the aircraft. The security force
   POC must be identified to the PIC.
   7.3.5. Security support is a continual requirement and is not negated by the presence of
   aircrew or ground crewmembers. Security force support terminates only after the aircraft
   doors are closed and the aircraft taxis.
7.4. Standby Aircraft Security. Ensure aircraft hatches and doors are secure to show
unauthorized entry. The PIC shall notify the C2 agency the aircraft is sealed and provide them a
means to access the aircraft in an emergency. Annotate the forms with the time the aircraft was
sealed. The C2 Senior Controller may grant access to a sealed aircraft, shall document time of
entry and ensure it remains launch capable. The PIC or designated representative must be present
if access to the aircraft is required and will ensure the aircraft is resealed. The aircrew pre-
preflight portion will remain valid if performed by one aircrew, sealed, and flown by another
aircrew. NOTE: WG/CCs should develop local procedures for documentation and management
IAW TO 00-20-1 and MAJCOM Supplement.
7.5. En Route Security. The planning agency must coordinate with the execution agency to
ensure adequate en route security is available. The PIC will receive a threat assessment and en
route security capability evaluation briefing for areas of intended operation prior to home station
departure and should request updates from en route C2 as required. If required, a PHOENIX
RAVEN team will be assigned to the mission.
 240                                               AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


   7.5.1. The PHOENIX RAVEN team will consist of three US Air Force security force
   members, but may include more depending on security requirements. The team's travel status
   is determined by MAJCOM. The team travels in MEP status and is responsible to the PIC at
   all times. In turn, the PIC is responsible for the team’s welfare (transportation, lodging, etc.).
   Ensure security team members receive a mission briefing and aircraft egress/passenger
   briefing (as appropriate).
   7.5.2. On arrival, the PIC will assess the local situation and take the following actions as
   required:
       7.5.2.1. Area patrol. Request area security patrols from local security forces. If local
       authorities request payment for this service, use the Aviation Into-Plane Reimbursement
       (AIR) Card or Standard Form 44 (SF 44).
       7.5.2.2. Aircrew surveillance. During short ground times, direct armed crewmembers to
       remain with the aircraft and maintain surveillance of aircraft entrances and activities in
       the aircraft vicinity.
       7.5.2.3. Inadequate Security. If, in the opinion of the PIC, airfield security is inadequate
       and the PIC determines the safety of the aircraft is in question, the PIC may waive the
       FDP limits and crew rest requirements and depart as soon as possible for a base
       considered reliable. Report movement and intentions to the controlling agency as soon as
       practical. If a departure is not possible, the aircrew must secure the aircraft to the best of
       their ability. In no case, will the entire crew leave the aircraft unattended. Crew rest
       requirements will be subordinate to aircraft security when the airframe may be at risk.
       The PIC should rotate a security detail among the crew to provide for both aircraft
       protection and crew rest until relief is available. Request security assistance from the
       nearest DoD installation, US Embassy, local military or law enforcement agencies as
       appropriate.
   7.5.3. Entry Control Procedures. Unescorted entry is granted to aircrew members and
   support personnel assigned to the mission who possess their home station AF Form 1199, Air
   Force Entry Control Card, supported by an Entry Access List (EAL) or aircrew orders.
   Aircrew members and assigned crew chiefs are authorized escort authority.
       7.5.3.1. Normally, non-United States nationals, such as cargo handlers, can perform their
       duties under escort and should not be placed on the EAL.
       7.5.3.2. Personnel not on the EAL or aircrew orders must be escorted within the area.
7.6. Detecting Unauthorized Entry.
   7.6.1. When parking on a secure ramp, the aircraft will normally be left unlocked/unsealed
   to allow ground personnel immediate access. If, in the PIC’s judgment, the aircraft needs to
   be locked and sealed in order to detect unauthorized entry, then:
       7.6.1.1. Use available aircraft ground security locking devices.
       7.6.1.2. Secure the doors in a manner that will indicate unauthorized entry (e.g., tape
       inside of doors to airframe so that entry pulls tape loose).
       7.6.1.3. Close and seal the crew entrance door (box car seal).
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                             241


       7.6.1.4. Wipe the immediate area around lock and latches clean to aid in investigation of
       a forced entry.
       7.6.1.5. Report any unauthorized entry or tampering to the Office of Special
       Investigation (OSI), security forces or local authorities, and the C2 agency. Have aircraft
       thoroughly inspected prior to flight.
   7.6.2. Security awareness is crucial to effective mission accomplishment. Aircrews must
   always remain vigilant to their surroundings, especially at high threat, low security locations.
   In addition to normal preflight activities, aircrews must inspect areas of the aircraft not
   covered by normal preflight duties, to include aircraft wheel wells, flap pack area, aft
   empennage area, avionics compartments, and environmental compartment of the aircraft for
   unauthorized packages, personnel, or other unfamiliar devices. Report any suspicious items
   to host security forces. Aircrews will maintain a heightened security posture throughout all
   pre-takeoff activities.
7.7. Preventive Measures. Commanders at all levels must ensure preventive measures are
taken to minimize access to the aircraft by potential hijackers. When a C-5 is operating away
from home station, the PIC will comply with this chapter and AFI 13-207, as supplemented.
   7.7.1. Preventive measures include the following: The host station passenger processing or
   manifesting facility should conduct anti-hijacking inspections. Do not board passengers until
   the PIC is fully satisfied with inspection results. In the absence of qualified passenger service
   representatives, the PIC will ensure the anti-hijacking inspection of passengers and baggage
   is accomplished.
   7.7.2. Not used.
   7.7.3. During exercises or contingencies in support of combat operations involving the
   movement of large groups of personnel, the unit being supported should manifest passengers
   and perform anti-hijacking inspections.
   7.7.4. Passengers will not carry weapons or ammunition on their person or in hand-carried
   baggage aboard an aircraft. EXCEPTION: Special agents, guards of the Secret Service or
   State Department, RAVEN Team Members, and other individuals specifically authorized to
   carry weapons. See paragraph 13.7
       7.7.4.1. RAVENs will only be armed in-flight on specifically designated missions
       identified on the mission “frag” as “RAVEN in-flight arming required”.
   7.7.5. If weapons must be cleared, instruct the individual(s) to:
       7.7.5.1. Move to a safe, clear area at least 50 feet from any aircraft, equipment, or
       personnel before un-holstering or un-slinging their weapons.
       7.7.5.2. Clear weapons in accordance with standard safety procedures. Ensure troop/PIC
       retains ammunition IAW paragraph 7.7.4.1.
7.8. Preventing and Resisting Hijacking.
   7.8.1. The Administrator, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), has exclusive
   responsibility to direct law enforcement activity related to actual or attempted aircraft piracy
   (hijacking) in the United States. See CJCSI 3610.01B, 49 USC 46501, and 49 USC 44903(e).
 242                                              AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


   7.8.2. In taking action during an aircraft hijacking situation, military forces will act under
   military command within the scope of their duties.
   7.8.3. In the event an aircraft involved in an aircraft hijacking situation is carrying
   documents, equipment, or material that DoD has determined to be highly sensitive, or
   weapons of mass destruction, DoD will provide FAA and where appropriate, the Federal
   Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with all pertinent information. Where possible, the FAA will
   consult and cooperate with DoD prior to directing any law enforcement activity.
   7.8.4. An aircraft is most vulnerable to hijacking when the aircrew is aboard and the aircraft
   is operationally ready for flight.
   7.8.5. A concerted effort must be made to prevent the hijacking of military or military
   contract aircraft by detecting potential hijackers before they board the aircraft.
   7.8.6. Should preventive efforts fail, any actual attempt to hijack a military aircraft must be
   resisted in a manner appropriate to the situation.
   7.8.7. Since air piracy may be committed by political terrorists or by individuals to whom
   the threat of death is not a deterrent but a stimulus, ordinary law enforcement procedures may
   be ineffective. Thus, successful conclusion of a hijacking situation and apprehension of the
   hijackers may require use of specialized law enforcement techniques and procedures.
   7.8.8. Delaying actions have been most successful in overcoming hijackings without loss of
   life or property.
   7.8.9. In the case of an aircraft carrying passengers, the primary concern is the safety of the
   passengers.
   7.8.10. Assistance to hijacked civil or military contract aircraft will be rendered as requested
   by the pilot in command of the aircraft and the authority exercising operational control of the
   anti-hijacking effort.
7.9. Initial Response. When an act of air piracy involves an Air Force installation or aircraft
within the United States, response will be according to the following guidelines until such time
as FAA assumes active direction of anti-hijacking efforts. Resist all attempts to hijack a military
aircraft. Resistance may vary from simple dissuasion through deception and subterfuge, to direct
physical confrontation, including the prudent use of weapons.
   7.9.1. The following guidelines should be used to counter a hijacking, actual or threatened,
   while the aircraft is on the ground:
       7.9.1.1. Delay movement of the aircraft to provide time for ground personnel and the
       aircrew to establish communication and execute coordinated resistance actions.
       7.9.1.2. The authority for determining when ground resistance will be discontinued is
       vested in the highest available level of command. When adequate communication cannot
       be established or when time does not permit, this authority is delegated in the following
       order:
           7.9.1.2.1. MAJCOM commander exercising operational control of the aircraft.
           7.9.1.2.2. MAJCOM commanders in whose AOR the airfield lies.
           7.9.1.2.3. Senior operational commander on scene.
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                             243


           7.9.1.2.4. PIC in compliance with MAJCOM directives.
   7.9.2. A hijacked aircraft carrying weapons of mass destruction will not be allowed to
   takeoff. Refer to DoD 5210.41M, Nuclear Weapon Security Manual, paragraph 9B(3), for
   additional guidance.
7.10. In-Flight Resistance. After airborne, success in thwarting a hijacking depends on the
resourcefulness of the aircrew. Many variables of a hijacking preclude use of any specific
counter-hijacking procedure. Some key factors should be evaluated before deciding a course of
action to be taken, including the nature of the threat, danger to life or crippling damage to the
aircraft in-flight, destination indicated by the hijacker, and the presence of sensitive material
onboard. Some counter-hijacking actions the aircrew may consider are:
   7.10.1. Engage the hijacker(s) in conversation in an attempt to calm them and to evaluate
   what course of action might be effective.
   7.10.2. Dissuade the hijacker.
   7.10.3. Use facts or subterfuge to convince the hijacker intermediate stops are necessary.
   7.10.4. Propose more favorable alternatives, such as landing in a neutral, rather than a
   hostile, country.
   7.10.5. Exploit any reasonable opportunity to incapacitate or overcome the hijacker
   physically, including the prudent use of firearms.
7.11. Communications Between Aircrew and Ground Agencies. Crews facing a hijacking
threat will transmit an in-the-clear notification of hijacking to ATC. If an in-the-clear
transmission is not possible, set transponder to 7500. If unable to set transponder, or if not under
radar control, transmit a radio message indicating transponder change to 7500. Notify ground
agencies by any means available as soon as practical and follow-up with situation reports as
circumstances permit. Covert signals are no longer to be used per FAA guidance.
7.12. Forced Penetration of Unfriendly Airspace. Refer to FIH for international signals for
air intercept.
7.13. Arming of Crewmembers. When crews are directed to be armed by the mission
execution authority, the PIC will determine which crewmembers will be armed (two loadmasters
and one flight engineer [normally, the scanner] will be armed unless directed otherwise). All
crewmembers should know who is armed. The following procedures apply when arming is
directed:
   7.13.1. Weapons Issue. Before departing home station, obtain weapons, ammunition, box,
   lock and key. Crewmembers will be armed according to AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of
   Force by Air Force Personnel and MAJCOM publications. If an armed crew member must
   leave the crew en route, transfer the weapon to another authorized crew member using AF
   IMT 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt.
   7.13.1. (439AW) Two crewmembers are required to obtain weapons from the 439 AW
   Armory. One person may draw multiple weapons per 439 AWI 31-201, Aircrew Weapons,
   paragraph 4.2.2. An additional crewmember is required for clearing barrel observer duties.
 244                                               AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


   7.13.2. Wearing of Weapons. Wear weapons in a holster, concealed at all times to prevent
   identifying armed crewmembers. Do not wear weapons off the flight line except to and from
   the C2, armories, and other facilities associated with aircrew activities.
       7.13.2.1. AMC Passenger Terminal Procedures. Armed crewmembers must discreetly
       identify themselves to AMC passenger service personnel upon arrival at security
       checkpoints. One crewmember will present a valid set of crew orders, their military
       identification card, and AF Form 523, USAF Authorization to Bear Firearms, authorizing
       the carrying of concealed weapons. Once terminal personnel verify this, they will allow
       the crewmember to vouch for the remaining crewmembers. The entire crew will then
       proceed through the magnetometer without removing objects from their pockets. This
       will prevent passengers from determining which crewmembers are armed.
   7.13.3. Weapons Storage In-Flight. Crewmembers will be armed before beginning preflight,
   onload or offload duties and until completion of all post-flight duties. When no passengers
   are aboard that require that the aircrew be armed, weapons may be stored in the gun box in-
   flight after a satisfactory stowaway check. Crewmembers will rearm before landing.
   Weapons need not be unloaded before placing them in a gun box.
   7.13.4. Weapons Storage on the Ground.
       7.13.4.1. Aircrews will store weapons and ammunition in the most secure facility
       available, normally the base armory.
       7.13.4.2. In the event a secure facility is unavailable:
       7.13.4.2. (439AW) During RON at home station, weapons shall not be stored in the
       aircraft gun box.
           7.13.4.2.1. Non-stage aircrews may store weapons and ammunition in the aircraft
           gun box.

                          OPERATIONAL REPORTS AND FORMS

8.1. General. This chapter provides guidelines for worksheets, reports, and forms associated
with AMC operational activities. Consult governing instruction or contact wing, unit, or local
flight safety officers for assistance with safety forms.
8.2. AF IMT 457, USAF Hazard Report. The AF IMT 457 is a tool to notify supervisors and
commanders of a hazardous condition that requires prompt corrective action. For hazardous
weather, complete the front side of an AF IMT 457 and send it to the parent wing flying safety
office. If addressing a computer flight plan deficiency, attach a copy of the AF IMT 72, Air
Report (AIREP). Send your report so the parent unit receives it within 5 days of the event. For
more information, see AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program.
8.3. AF IMT 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR). The AF IMT 651 is a tool to report
near midair collisions and alleged hazardous air traffic conditions. See Attachment 3 of AFI 91-
202 for more information concerning the HATR program.
   8.3.1. AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, and AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety
   Investigations and Reports, list HATR reportable incidents.
   8.3.2. The PIC shall report the hazardous condition to the nearest ATC agency (e.g. center,
   Flight Service Station (FSS), control tower, or aeronautical radio station) as quickly as safety
   allows. Include the following information in the radio call (as appropriate):
       8.3.2.1. Aircraft identification or call sign.
       8.3.2.2. Time and place (radial/DME of NAVAID, position relative to the airfield,
       incident, etc).
       8.3.2.3. Altitude or flight level.
       8.3.2.4. Description of the other aircraft or vehicle.
       8.3.2.5. Advise controlling ATC agency that the PIC will file a HATR upon landing.
   8.3.3. Deadline to file a HATR is 24 hours after event via any communication mode
   available. If landing airport has a USAF airfield management function, submit completed AF
   IMT 651 to the airfield management officer for forwarding to wing safety office. If landing
   airport does not have an airfield management office, notify the safety office of the Air Force
   base nearest to location where the condition occurred, PIC’s home base safety office, or as
   prescribed by overseas MAJCOM. In that case, provide contact sufficient information to
   prepare AF IMT 651.
   8.3.4. Grant individuals who submit a HATR immunity from disciplinary action provided:
       8.3.4.1. If they were the offending party, their violation was not deliberate.
       8.3.4.2. They committed no criminal offense.
       8.3.4.3. Their actions did not result in a mishap.
       8.3.4.4. They properly reported the incident using procedures above.

           8.5.6.1.2. C2 agents must prepare an OPREP-3 if EMI is suspected meaconing,
           intrusion, or jamming, interference sufficient to cause a hazard, or, if in the PIC’s
           judgment, the situation warrants such a report.
           8.5.6.1.3. PICs shall serve as classification authority for EMI reports. Evaluate the
           adversaries’ ability to exploit certain systems using EMI and protect information
           accordingly. PICs on a non-sensitive mission or who judge the EMI to be interference
           from a non-hostile source need not classify EMI reports unless that report would
           reveal system vulnerability. Classify interference report(s) at stations located in
           combat areas or during sensitive military missions.
8.6. Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricants (POL) - Aviation Fuels Documentation. This section
prescribes aviation POL (AVPOL) procedures that ensure correct documentation, form and
invoice processing, and program supervision. Use the Multi Service Corporation (MSC) air card
for the purchase of aviation fuel and ancillary ground services at commercial airports (and some
military installations) worldwide. The air card is authorized for use by all U.S. government
aircraft, state, and local law enforcement aircraft, and some foreign government aircraft. All
PICs should plan to use the “platinum” MSC card. In most cases, there will be no changes when
 250                                            AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


refueling at non-Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) contract locations. The MSC card is
accepted at approximately 4,800 locations worldwide. A list of all MSC-accepting merchants can
be found at https://www.airseacard.com. It replaces the Standard Form (SF) 44, Purchase
Order-Invoice-Voucher, at locations that accept the MSC card.
   8.6.1. Responsibilities. Aircrew and maintenance personnel will be familiar with AVPOL
   procedures and documentation requirements of this chapter. Improper use of the MSC card
   could create financial liability for the purchaser.
   8.6.2. Refuel/defuel USAF aircraft at DoD locations whenever possible. If DoD service is
   not available, purchase fuel from other source(s) in the following priority:
       8.6.2.1. Defense Fuel Supply Center (DFSC) or Canadian into-plane contracts.
       8.6.2.2. Foreign government air forces. NOTE:        DoD FLIP en route supplements
       identify locations with into-plane contracts.
   8.6.3. AVPOL Forms Documentation and Procedures.
       8.6.3.1. The DD Form 1898, Fuel Sale Slip, is the fuel transaction receipt used for
       purchases at other DoD locations, including DFSC into-plane contract locations. Log and
       place the DD Form 1898 inside the AF Form 644. The PIC or designated representative
       shall complete this form. NOTE: If the contractor insists on a unique invoice along with
       the DD Form 1898, annotate the vendor’s invoice with “DUPLICATE DD Form 1898
       ACCOMPLISHED.”
       8.6.3.2. The AF IMT 664, Aircraft Fuels Documenting Log, is a tool to log and store all
       AVPOL transaction forms. Record all off-station transactions on the front of the form and
       insert the original form inside the envelope. Turn in the AF IMT 664, with supporting
       forms, to maintenance debriefing or as directed by local procedures. The PIC or
       designated representative shall complete this form when appropriate.
       8.6.3.3. The SF 44, Purchase Order-Invoice-Voucher, may be used to purchase fuel,
       ground services and/or other authorized products when no MSC card contract is in place.
          8.6.3.3.1. SF 44 fuel purchases where FBO agrees to invoice DESC for payment.
              8.6.3.3.1.1. The aircrew shall present the SF 44 as the purchase invoice when an
              FBO refuses to accept the MSC card. The aircrew shall complete the SF 44 and
              attach it to the FBO vendor ticket/invoice when the FBO also declines use of the
              SF 44 and uses its own invoice/receipt. Fuel purchases shall be documented on a
              separate SF 44 from ground services and other authorized products since the FBO
              must invoice DESC for the fuel and the customer for non-fuel product and
              services.
              8.6.3.3.1.2. Copies 1 and 2 of the SF 44 shall be provided to the FBO. Copy 1 of
              the SF 44 and one copy of the FBO commercial invoice, if applicable, shall be
              forwarded to the following address by the FBO to bill/invoice DESC: DESC-

            commercial invoice, if applicable, to directly bill/invoice the purchasing
            organization. Block 9 of the SF 44 shall reflect the organization name and address
            of the finance office responsible for payment to the FBO. The purchasing
            organization shall make payment to the FBO upon receipt of the invoice from the
            FBO. Log and place a copy inside the AF IMT 664.
        8.6.3.3.4. If the vendor presents their own form for signature and accepts the SF 44,
        write the statement "SF 44 Executed" on the vendor’s form.
        8.6.3.3.5. Turn in two copies of the SF 44 to the operations officer at home station.
        8.6.3.3.6. Present the aircraft identaplate for purchases at SITCO Agreement
        locations. Make certain the invoice includes date of transaction, grade of product,
        quantity issued/defueled, unit of measure, and signature of Air Force member who
        accepted product. If vendor also requires completed SF 44 write statement, "AF
        FORMS EXECUTED” on vendor’s invoice. Log and place a copy inside the AF IMT
        664.

  AIRCREW OPERATIONS IN CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND
                 NUCLEAR THREAT ENVIRONMENT

10.1. Overview. The proliferation of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN)
weapons and the means to deliver them present serious security threats to the global operations
of air mobility forces. This chapter describes the CBRN threat, passive defense measures to
mitigate that threat, and guidance for ground and flight operations in a contaminated
environment. Refer to AFPAM 10-100 for additional guidance.
10.2. Understanding the CBRN Threat.
   10.2.1. Chemical Weapons. Militarily significant chemical weapons include nerve, blister,
   choking, and blood agents. A key point for aircrew members to remember is that time is on
   your side. The ultra-violet (UV) rays of the sun, high temperatures, and high absorption rates
   of chemicals all decrease their lethality. Most chemical agents will either evaporate or absorb
   into surfaces. For decontamination, cleaning with hot soap and water and/or a 5 percent
   bleach solution currently appears to be the best and most practical method of removing
   chemical agents that may remain as a contact hazard on glass, and unpainted metal.
   Currently, the only decontaminate authorized for use on aircraft is soap and water.
   WARNING: Recent tests indicate that as a decontaminated aircraft dries, the absorbed
   chemical warfare agent (CWA) may resurface from painted surfaces causing contact and
   vapor hazards.
   10.2.2. Biological Weapons. Biological warfare agents (BWA) are normally divided into
   three areas: bacteria (i.e., Anthrax) that live outside the cell, reproduce, and are normally
   susceptible to antibiotics; toxins (i.e., Ricin), that are poisons produced by living organisms
   or plants; and viruses (i.e., Smallpox) that normally require the host of a living cell to survive
   and reproduce. Viruses and toxins do not respond to antibiotics. It is probable that the
   medical community would be the first to recognize that an upsurge in “flu-like symptoms” is
   actually a bio attack. Although BWA are degraded by UV rays, humidity and high/low
   temperatures, some BWA (i.e., Anthrax spores) may have a long life, lasting decades under
   the right conditions. Current immunizations and good personal hygiene help prevent
   infection.
   10.2.3. Radiological Weapons. The radiation dispersal device (RDD), or so-called “dirty
   bomb,” is the typical radiological weapon. RDD is any device that disseminates radioactive
   material without using a nuclear detonation. Key points to remember are that shielding and
   distance are the best defenses against radiation exposure.
   10.2.4. Nuclear Weapons. The threat from a nuclear device is from the initial blast, heat, and
   radiation. In addition, the Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) from a nuclear detonation can
   damage electronic equipment. The best protection is a combination of shielding, distance
   from the blast, and limited time of exposure.
10.3. CBRN Passive Defense Measures. Passive defense measures are those activities
conducted to negate, contain, and manage the effects of CBRN attack. Passive defense measures
include pre, trans, and post-attack actions designed to mitigate the CBRN threat through
contamination avoidance, protection, and contamination control.
260                                              AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


  10.3.1. Contamination Avoidance. Contamination avoidance is the most important passive
  defense measure. Techniques for contamination avoidance include inflight diversion,
  survival launch, and minimizing exposure to contaminated cargo, aerospace ground
  equipment (AGE), and material handling equipment (MHE).
      10.3.1.1. Inflight Diversion. When advised that a destination airfield is under CBRN
      attack or has been contaminated, the aircrew will divert to an uncontaminated airfield, if
      at all possible. Authority to land at a contaminated airfield will be specified in the
      controlling OPORD
      10.3.1.2. Survival Launch. If caught on the ground during attack warning, every
      reasonable effort will be made to launch to avoid the attack. Upon proper clearances,
      aircrew may launch to survive if they have sufficient fuel and unrestricted, safe access to
      the runway. In practice, this option may only be practical for aircraft that have just landed
      or aircraft at or near the end of the runway. If launch is not possible, shut down engines
      and avoid running environmental control systems. Close aircraft doors/hatches/ramps,
      don Individual Protective Equipment (IPE), and seek personal protective cover on the
      base. If time does not permit using base facilities, remain in the sealed aircraft for a
      minimum of one-hour after the attack and/or follow host-base guidance.
      10.3.1.3. Avoiding Cross Contamination from AGE, MHE, and Cargo. All formerly
      contaminated equipment and cargo must be marked to facilitate contamination avoidance
      and the use of protective measures. Additionally, the air shipment of formerly
      contaminated cargo requires special precautions and must be specifically authorized by
      the senior transportation commander.
  10.3.2. Protection. When exposure to chemical and/or biological agents cannot be avoided,
  protection provides the force with the ability to survive and operate in a CBRN environment.
  Protection is afforded by individual protective equipment, collective protection, and
  hardening of facilities.
      10.3.2.1. Individual Protective Equipment. The current in-flight protective gear for
      aircrew members is the Aircrew Chemical Defense Ensemble (ACDE). The ACDE
      includes the Aircrew Eye/Respiratory Protection (AERP) or Joint Service Aircrew Mask
      (JSAM) "above the shoulder" equipment and the CWU-66/P Aircrew Chemical
      Ensemble (ACE). The Ground Crew Ensemble (GCE) consists of the protective mask, C2
      series canister (or filter element for MCU-2A/P protective mask), and over garment,
      boots, and gloves. The ACDE and GCE provide protection against chemical and
      biological agents. They do not provide blast or radiation protection from an RDD or
      nuclear detonation. The ACDE requires care during donning using "buddy dressing"
      procedures and Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) expertise during processing through the
      Aircrew Contamination Control Area (ACCA). NOTE: AECMs will utilize the MCU-2A
      series mask.
         10.3.2.1.1. ACDE/GCE Issue. Aircrews will be issued sized ACDE and GCE at
         home station. Aircrews will ensure their ACDE and GCE are available at all times
         while in a CBRN threat area. Aircrew members will confirm the mobility bag
         contents and correct sizes.
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                           261


         10.3.2.1.2. ACDE Wear During Ground Operations. Because aircraft contamination
         is unlikely to occur during flight; ground operations can represent the highest threat to
         aircrew safety. Protection from enemy attacks and exposure to liquid chemical agents
         is paramount. Aircrews should limit activities to essential duties only and separate
         ground duties from air duties.
     10.3.2.2. Collective Protection. Collective protection provides a temperature-controlled,
     contamination-free environment to allow personnel relief from continuous wear of IPE
     such as the ACDE. The basic concept for most facility collective protective solutions is to
     employ overpressure, filtration, and controlled entry/exit. The intent is to provide rest and
     relief accommodations, as well as provide medical treatment in contamination free zone.
     All pressurization systems should be shut down and doors sealed if the crew finds itself
     in need of immediate protection. Crewmembers should avail themselves of facilities, if
     provided, on the airfield.
     10.3.2.3. Hardening. Permanent and expedient hardening measures are used to
     strengthen buildings and utility systems or provide barriers to resist blast effects. To
     reduce the potential of vapor exposure, personnel should consider the use of facilities
     above the first floor.
  10.3.3. Contamination Control. In the post-attack environment, contamination control
  measures limit the spread of chemical, biological, and radiological contamination through
  disease prevention measures, decontamination, and use of Exchange Zone (EZ) operations.
  Effective contamination control helps sustain air mobility operations by minimizing
  performance degradation, casualties, or loss of material.
     10.3.3.1. Disease Prevention. Up-to-date immunizations, standard personal hygiene
     practices, and the use of chemoprophylaxis are effective biological warfare defensive
     measures.
     10.3.3.2. Decontamination.
         10.3.3.2.1. Inflight Decontamination. Air washing is a useful inflight
         decontamination technique for removing most of the liquid agent from aircraft metal
         surfaces. However, vapor hazards may remain in areas where the airflow
         characteristics prevent complete off-gassing (i.e., wheel wells, flap wells, rivet and
         screw heads, joints, etc.). Flights of at least 2 to 4 hours are recommended, and lower
         altitudes are more effective than higher altitudes. Fly with the aircraft configured
         (gear, flaps, and slats extended) as long as possible to maximize the airflow in and
         around as many places as possible. Be advised that exterior contamination may seep
         into the aircraft interior creating a vapor hazard for aircrews. Use of ACDE is
         recommended. Follow smoke and fume elimination procedures to help purge interior
         contamination.
         10.3.3.2.2. Limits of Decontamination. Complete decontamination of aircraft and
         equipment may be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. Formerly contaminated
         assets will be restricted to DOD-controlled airfields and not released from US
         government control.
     10.3.3.3. Exchange Zone (EZ) Operations. The AMC Concept for Air Mobility
     Operations in a Chemical and Biological Environment (CB CONOPS) describes a
 262                                               AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


       method for continuing the vital flow of personnel into a contaminated airfield while
       limiting the number of air mobility aircraft and personnel exposed to the contaminated
       environment. The purpose of the EZ is to minimize the spread of contamination within
       the air mobility fleet, preserving as many aircraft as possible for unrestricted international
       flight. The EZ is an area (located at uncontaminated airfield) set aside to facilitate the
       exchange of uncontaminated (clean) cargo/passengers to a contaminated (dirty) airframe,
       or vice versa, without cross-contamination. Additional information on the EZ is available
       through AMC/A3X.
10.4. Flight Operations.
   10.4.1. Mission Planning. Aircrews must be mentally prepared to face the dangers of CBRN
   weapons. Flight/mission planning must be thorough. Aircraft commanders should emphasize
   ACDE wear, crew coordination, CBRN hazards and countermeasures, inflight diversion,
   plans for onload/offload in the event of a ground attack, and plans for the return leg in the
   event of aircraft contamination. Alternative scenario plans should also be considered in the
   event Mission-Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) conditions change.
   10.4.2. Establishing the Threat Level. Aircrews should monitor command and control
   channels to ensure they receive the latest information concerning the destination's alert
   condition. Diversion of aircraft to alternate "clean" locations may be required, unless
   operational necessity otherwise dictates. The TACC or theater C2 agency (normally through
   the controlling OPORD) will direct aircrew pre-exposure activities such as medical pre-
   treatment for chemical/biological exposure.
   10.4.3. Fuel Requirements. Extra fuel may be needed to compensate for altitude restrictions
   as the result of CB agent exposure. During purge periods, the aircraft will be unpressurized.
   Although the aircrew can use the aircraft oxygen systems, passengers wearing GCE cannot,
   thus restricting the aircraft cruise altitude and increasing fuel requirements accordingly.
   10.4.4. Oxygen Requirements. Operating a contaminated aircraft will increase oxygen
   requirements. Aircrew wear of ACDE will require use of the aircraft oxygen system to
   counter actual/suspected contamination. Using the 100 percent oxygen setting offers the
   greatest protection in a contaminated environment. Appropriate oxygen reservoir levels must
   be planned to meet higher consumption rates. Use the aircraft flight manual charts to
   calculate the required reservoir levels.
   10.4.5. Donning Equipment. Aircrew will don ACDE based on the alarm condition (See
   Airman’s Manual (AFPAM 10-100). Use the "buddy dressing" procedures, and refer to
   AMCVA 11-303, AERP Donning Checklist and AMCVA 11-304, ACDE Donning Checklist,
   to ensure proper wear. When wearing the ACDE, Atropine and 2 PAM Chloride auto
   injectors will be kept in the upper left ACDE pocket. If the integrated survival vest/body
   armor is worn, the Atropine and 2 PAM Chloride auto injectors may be kept in the lower
   right flight suit pocket. This standardized location will enable personnel to locate the
   medication should an individual be overcome by CWA poisoning. M-9 paper on the flight
   suit will facilitate detection of liquid chemical agents and ACCA processing. M-9 paper
   should be placed on the flight suit prior to entering the CBRN threat area or when an alarm
   “yellow” or higher has been declared. When inbound to a CBRN threat area, prior to descent,
   the aircraft commander will ensure crew and passengers don appropriate protective
   equipment IAW arrival destination's MOPP level and brief aircrew operations in the CBRN
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                            263


   threat area. As a minimum, this briefing will include: flight deck isolation, oxygen
   requirements, air conditioning system requirements, IPE requirements, ground operations,
   and MOPP levels. Aircrew members must determine if the wear of the integrated survival
   vest/body armor and LPUs will restrict dexterity and mobility to the point that it becomes a
   safety issue. If the aircrew deems the equipment to create a safety of flight concern, then the
   items may be pre-positioned (instead of worn) on the aircraft to be readily available to the
   aircrew.
   10.4.6. Communicating Down-line Support. Pass aircraft and cargo contamination
   information through command and control channels when inbound. This information will be
   used to determine if a diversion flight is required or decontamination teams are needed.
   Report the physical condition of any crew/passengers who are showing agent symptoms and
   whether they are wearing chemical defense ensembles.
10.5. Ground Operations.
   10.5.1. Crew Rest Procedures. Operational necessity may require the aircrew to rest/fly in a
   contaminated environment. If the mission is not being staged by another aircrew or pre-flight
   crews are not available, the aircrew may pre-flight, load, and secure the aircraft prior to
   entering crew rest. The departing aircrew will perform necessary crew preparations and pre-
   flight briefings. Then, they will report to the ACCA for processing and ACDE donning with
   assistance from AFE personnel. If possible, aircrew transport should be provided in a
   covered vehicle. Aircrews should avoid pre-flighting the aircraft prior to departure to prevent
   contamination spread to them and/or the aircraft. As aircrews proceed to fly, they will require
   assistance from ground support personnel in removing their aircrew protective overcape and
   overboots prior to entering the aircraft.
   10.5.2. Onload and Offload Considerations. Extreme care must be exercised to prevent
   contamination spread to the aircraft interior during ground operations, particularly to the
   flight deck area. Reduce the number of personnel entering the aircraft. Contaminated engine
   covers, safety pins and chocks will not be placed in the aircraft unless sealed in clean plastic
   bags. Aircrew members entering the aircraft will remove plastic overboots and overcape
   portions of the aircrew ensemble and ensure flight/mobility bags are free of contaminants and
   placed in clean plastic bags. Prior to entering the aircraft all personnel should implement boot
   wash/decontamination procedures. Aircrew exiting aircraft into a contaminated environment
   will don plastic overboots and overcape prior to leaving the aircraft.
   10.5.3. Communications. Conducting on/offloading operations, while wearing the complete
   ACDE, complicates communications capability. Use the mini-amplifier/speaker or the
   aircraft public address system and augment with flashlight and hand signals, as required.
   10.5.4. Airlift of Retrograde Cargo. Only CRITICAL retrograde cargo will be moved from a
   contaminated to an uncontaminated airbase. Critical requirements are pre-designated in
   theater war plans. Onload cargo will be protected prior to and while being transported to the
   aircraft. If contaminated, protective cover(s) will be removed/replaced just prior to placing
   the cargo on the aircraft. It is the user's responsibility to decontaminate cargo for air
   shipment. The airlift of contaminated or formerly contaminated cargo requires the approval
   of the senior transportation commander.
 264                                              AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


   10.5.5. Passenger/Patients. A path should be decontaminated between the aircraft and the
   ground transportation vehicle to reduce interior contamination when loading/unloading
   passengers/patients. Normally, externally contaminated patients and those infected with
   contagious biological agents will not be transported onboard AMC or AMC-procured
   aircraft. The AMC/CC is the waiver authority to this policy. NOTE: An altitude below
   10,000 feet is recommended due to AECM use of the ground chemical mask.
   10.5.6. Physiological Factors. Aircraft commanders must be very sensitive to the problems
   resulting from physical exertion while wearing ACDE. The aircraft commander should
   consider factors such as ground time, temperature, and remaining mission requirements when
   determining on/offload capabilities. Individuals involved should be closely monitored for
   adverse physiological effects.
   10.5.7. Work Degradation Factors. Work timetables need to be adjusted to minimize thermal
   stress caused by wearing the ACDE. Aircrews must weigh all factors when performing in-
   flight and ground duties. The following are degradation factors for wearing full GCE, and
   may also be used to represent the Task Time Multipliers for the ACDE. A more extensive
   discussion of this subject is found in AFMAN 10-2602, Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, and
   Conventional (NBCC) Defense Operations and Standards.

NOTES:
1. If wearing MOPP 4, add 10ºF to Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT). If wearing personal body
armor in humid climates, add 5ºF to WBGT.
2. Rest means minimal physical activity (sitting or standing), accomplished in shade if possible.

3. CAUTION: Daily fluid intake should not exceed 12 quarts. Hourly fluid intake should not exceed
1 quart. The work/rest time and fluid replacement volumes will sustain performance and hydration for
at least 4 hours of work in the specified work category. Individual water needs will vary ±¼ quart/ hour.
4. NL=no limit to work time per hour.

   10.5.8. Outbound with Actual/Suspected Chemical Contamination. Once airborne with
   actual/suspected vapor contamination, the aircraft must be purged for 2 hours using Smoke
   and Fume Elimination procedures. To ensure no liquid contamination exists, a close
   inspection of aircrew, passenger ensembles, and cargo will be conducted using M-8 and M-9
   detection paper. Detection paper only detects certain liquid agents and will not detect vapor
   hazards. Above the shoulder ACDE should only be removed if there is absolutely no vapor
   hazard. Be advised that residual contamination (below the detectable levels of currently
   fielded detection equipment) may be harmful in an enclosed space. The aircrew must take
   every precaution to prevent spreading of liquid contaminants, especially on the flight deck
   area. The best course is to identify actual/suspected contamination, avoid those areas for the
   remainder of the flight, and keep the cargo compartments cool. If an aircrew member or
   passenger has been in contact with liquid contaminants, all personnel aboard the aircraft will
   stay in full ACDE/GCE until processed through their respective contamination control area
   (CCA). Upon arrival, the contaminated aircraft will be parked in an isolated area and
   cordoned to protect unsuspecting ground personnel.
   10.5.9. Documenting Aircraft Contamination. When it is suspected or known that an
   aerospace vehicle or piece of equipment has been contaminated with a radiological,
   biological or chemical contaminant, a Red X will be entered and an annotation will be made
   in historical records for the lifecycle of the equipment.
   10.5.10. 10-Foot Rule. The 10-foot rule was developed in order to provide guidance for
   protecting personnel using or handling contaminated resources (such as pallets) or working in
   locations with materials that might retain a residual chemical. The 10-foot rule embodies a
   safety factor that goes beyond current OSD guidance (which allows removal of IPE
   whenever detectors no longer detect a chemical agent vapor hazard). There are two phases
   associated with the 10-foot rule.
       10.5.10.1. Initial Phase. During the initial phase, personnel will remain in MOPP 4
       whenever they stay within 10 feet of the contaminated equipment for more than a few
       seconds. This MOPP level provides personnel the maximum protection from the
       chemical agent as it transitions from a contact and vapor hazard to a vapor hazard only.
       10.5.10.2. Follow-on Phase. In the follow-on phase, personnel will use gloves of a sort
       (i.e. leather, rubber, cloth, etc.) when operating on or handling the contaminated
       equipment. Although a contact hazard is unlikely, relatively small amounts of the agent
       may still be present. The use of gloves will ensure that unnecessary bare skin contact with
       agent residue is avoided.
       10.5.10.3. Table 10 2. shows times associated with initial and follow-on phases of the
       10-foot rule. To simplify response processes, commanders may choose to use the worst
       case scenario as the foundation for all 10-foot rule actions, i.e., 24 hours for the initial
       phase and all periods of time greater than 24 hours for the follow-on phase.

                                          Chapter 11

                              NAVIGATION PROCEDURES

11.1. General. This chapter establishes procedures and requirements for worldwide en route C-
5 navigation. It is to be used in conjunction with procedures and requirements set forth in AFI
11-202V3, AFI 11-217, and FLIP. Since airspace and associated navigational aid equipment
capability are rapidly evolving, pilots must maintain an in-depth knowledge of current
requirements/policies.
   11.1.1. Prolonged Loss of Contact. Aircrews must ensure they are following proper
   navigation crosscheck procedures to maintain airspace situational awareness.
       11.1.1.1. Aircrews will use navigation charts to identify radio frequency changeover
       points to minimize the likelihood of prolonged loss of communication with ATC/radio
       operators. Additionally, crews must monitor both VHF and UHF Guard to the maximum
       extent possible.
       11.1.1.2. In the event of known or suspected loss of two-way radio capability, follow the
       communications failure procedures published in the FIH.
       11.1.1.3. In cases of suspected loss of contact with ATC, attempt to reestablish contact
       using other aircraft to relay messages to ATC controllers.
11.2. Operations in International/Territorial Airspace. (See AFTTP 3-3.C-5., FLIP, FCG,
and AP, for further procedures and guidance).
11.3. Mission Planning.
   11.3.1. The PIC or designated representative shall verify that proposed routes and flight
   altitudes and levels provide proper terrain clearance and meet FLIP and Foreign Clearance
   Guide requirements.
   11.3.2. Pilots shall crosscheck the computer flight plan (CFP) route of flight against the ATC
   Acknowledgement Message, and the route of flight entered on the DD Form 175, Military
   Flight Plan, DD Form 1801, DoD International Flight Plan, or ICAO flight plan.
   11.3.3. If a CFP is out of date or not available and routing or meteorological information is
   desired, the PIC should obtain direct assistance from the 618 AOC (TACC) flight planner or
   IFM. CFPs and CFP tracks to assist in manual flight planning are available with a current
   GDSS2 account through the AMC Aircrew Portal.
   11.3.4. Upon return to home station turn in all applicable plotting charts (copies if reused),
   computer flight plans and fuel calculations to the squadron. Squadrons will retain the
   materials for a minimum of 3 months.
11.4. Master Flight Plan.
   11.4.1. Only one CFP (Master) shall be used on the flight deck. Annotate the Master CFP by
   writing “MASTER” on top of the cover page.
       11.4.1.1. For all flights, circle each waypoint number on the Master CFP when the
       correct coordinates are checked by another crewmember.
 268                                              AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


       11.4.1.1. (439AW) After verifying coordinates of next waypoint, draw a slash ("/")
       through the circled waypoint on the CFP. Cross out (“X”) each waypoint after it is
       overflown.
       11.4.1.2. When not under radar contact, annotate waypoint crossing times, flight level
       and fuel remaining on the right margin adjacent to the waypoint. Check the magnetic
       course, temperature deviation and compare the predicted winds to the actual winds aloft.
       Note trends to fuel remaining (actual vs. planned). See paragraph 14.5.2 for additional
       guidance.
          11.4.1.2.1. Adjacent to the next waypoint, record the ETA reported to ATC (this
          includes estimates automatically reported via ADS).
       11.4.1.3. All navigation information appearing on the Master CFP must be checked
       against the best available prime source data. When a re-route is necessary, it is
       recommended that TACC provide a new Master CFP. For reroutes inflight, clearly cross
       out the old waypoints and enter new waypoints in their place.
11.5. Category I Routes.
   11.5.1. Oceanic Plotting Chart.
       11.5.1.1. Prior to flight, the PIC or designated representative shall plot the oceanic
       portion of the flight on an appropriate chart (e.g. OPC, GNC, Jeppesen). Place the
       following information on the chart: Mission number, Preparer’s and PIC’s name, Date,

11.7. Grid Operations.
   11.7.1. Grid Operations. Operations above 70 degrees north and below 60 degrees south
   require thorough study and understanding of instrument approach procedures (IAP) and of
   INS procedures and heading displays. The PIC will decide whether headings will be
   magnetic, grid, or true oriented and ensure the other pilots understand what type heading is
   being displayed on the HSIs, BDHIs, and CDUs. NOTE: Grivation (GV) shown on the IAP
   applies to other aircraft and will not be used for C-5 operations. IAPs above approximately
   65 degrees north contain the following notice: Grid courses are true polar courses and
   convergence angle factor shall not be applied. Convergence angle factors apply to sub-polar
   navigation charts used by aircraft other than C-5 and must not be used. C-5s will use a
   convergence factor of 1.00000.
   11.7.2. Review applicable AFI’s and flight manuals prior to grid operations.

                                          Chapter 12

    FLIGHT ENGINEER / AIRCREW MAINTENANCE SUPPORT PROCEDURES

12.1. General: This chapter contains flight engineer procedures not contained in the flight
manual, other portions of this AFI, or other publications.
12.2. Responsibilities. The flight engineer is responsible to the pilot in command for all
inspections and procedures required by the applicable technical orders and regulations.
   12.2.1. Second Engineer. A qualified second engineer can perform scanner duties without
   direct supervision and is responsible to the primary engineer for the completion of all duties
   for which they are qualified. When performing primary FE duties, the second engineer must
   be under the supervision of an instructor or flight examiner.
12.3. Authority to Clear a Red X. If a situation is encountered where the aircraft is on a Red X
and qualified maintenance personnel are not available to clear it, the highest qualified flight
engineer on scene may obtain authorization to sign off the Red X from the home station
MXG/CC or designated representative, in accordance with T.O. 00-20-1. Other crew members
are not authorized to clear a Red X. EXCEPTION: The flight engineer may clear Red Xs for
fan stops, pitot covers, gear pins, engine cowls, access panels, throttle lock plate, NLG steering
manifold input arm, and single point refueling (SPR) drains when qualified maintenance
personnel are not available, unless prohibited by the home station MXG/CC or OG/CC.
12.4. Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations. The flight engineer is qualified and
authorized to accomplish these duties when maintenance personnel are not available. This policy
is designed for support of the aircraft and its mission while away from home station. The
applicable refueling and de-fueling checklists will be used during all refueling and de-fueling
operations. If ground support personnel are not available, the aircraft commander will designate
other crewmembers to assist the flight engineer. A flight engineer may assist the normal
maintenance function when critical taskings dictate their use, provided this action does not
impact crew duty and crew rest limits specified in Chapter 3 of this AFI. EXCEPTION: Flight
Engineers will not service Nitrogen or Oxygen.        WARNING: Do not load/off-load cargo
containing explosives, oxygen, flammable gases or liquids during fuel servicing operations.
   12.4.1. Fuel Servicing Operations. Unless servicing JP-4, simultaneous servicing of fuel
   while loading passengers, cargo, performing maintenance, aircrew members performing
   inspections, or operating aircraft systems is considered to be a normal fuel servicing
   operation. If refueling/defueling with JP-4 Concurrent Servicing operations are required
   IAW TO 00-25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and Static Grounding/Bonding. Aircrew
   members qualified in ground refueling may perform fuel servicing duties. Aircrews will only
   refuel in cases when maintenance support is not readily available and the mission would be
   delayed. Flight Engineers are qualified in ground refueling operations.
       12.4.1.1. When aircrew members are required to refuel, the flight engineer will act as the
       refueling team supervisor. Flight engineers will comply with T.O. 00-25-172 and
       applicable T.O. 1C-5A-2 series T.O.s when acting as refueling supervisor and panel

         12.4.1.1.1. Concurrent Ground Operations. The PIC and chief servicing supervisor
         (CSS) shall ensure aircrew members and servicing personnel accomplish concurrent
         servicing (CS) in accordance with T.O. 00-25-172 and servicing technical orders.
         Aircrews performing Dash-1 preflight inspections or cargo loading concurrent with
         servicing must have cooperation and close coordination with the CSS. The CSS will
         remain in continuous intercom contact with fuel servicing team members during the
         entire servicing operation. Team members include CSS, a monitor for each SPR in
         use, refueling panel monitor, fuel specialists. When the aircrew is at the aircraft, the
         PIC is responsible for all aspects of aircraft operations and shall inform the CSS how
         aircrew members will participate in passenger evacuation/safety. In keeping with the
         guidelines in T.O. 00-25-172, CSS has authority over all phases of CS operations to
         include personnel participating in the refuel.
      12.4.1.2. Designate a current and qualified maintenance personnel or aircrew member to
      remain on the flight deck to monitor interphone and be prepared to broadcast a request
      for emergency assistance on a radio tuned to the appropriate agency with ready access to
      an emergency response team anytime aircrew members are in the aircraft and fuel
      servicing is being conducted. The PA may be used to direct passenger evacuation in an
      emergency.
      12.4.1.3. Unless environmental conditions dictate, the primary emergency exit will
      remain open and stairs/ladders in place.
      12.4.1.4. With passengers on board a current and qualified aircrew member will be
      designated the passenger compartment monitor (PCM) and shall continuously monitor
      passengers during fuel servicing operations. PCMs will not perform other duties during
      fuel servicing.
      12.4.1.5. The PCM shall brief passengers on emergency egress, exits, prohibitions, and
      hazards. Passengers will remain seated except for brief physiological needs, but will not
      wear seat belts. When possible, conduct this briefing prior to fuel servicing. If fuel
      servicing is in progress, the briefing will be given immediately after boarding.
      12.4.1.6. When authorized, passengers may board or exit the aircraft for the express
      purpose of loading for departure or off-loading upon arrival. Boarding or exiting must be
      opposite of fuel servicing operations. Once onboard, except for emergencies, passengers
      shall not deplane once fuel servicing commences.
      12.4.1.7. Passengers are not required to ground themselves.
      12.4.1.8. The PIC, or designated maintenance/aircrew representative will advise PCMs
      when to evacuate passengers.
      12.4.1.9. The PCM shall set the interior lighting as bright as possible to suit the combat
      environment.

           12.4.1.10.3. APU’s and ATM’s may be used.
       12.4.1.11. Avoid refueling with JP-8+100 while transiting airfields with JP-8+100
       capabilities. AMC aircraft are not allowed to operate on JP-8+100, except in emergency
       conditions. All JP-8+100 locations are required to maintain a clean JP-8 capability to
       support transient aircraft. If inadvertent refueling with JP-8+100 occurs comply with the
       following:
           12.4.1.11.1. De-fuel the aircraft prior to flight.
           12.4.1.11.2. Make an AFTO Form 781 entry stating “Caution: Aircraft refueled
           using JP-8+100, preventative measures must be taken when de-fueling.”
   12.4.2. Hot Refueling. Hot refueling (refueling with aircraft engines running) will only be
   conducted by crews that have been authorized and certified according to AFI 11-235,
   Forward Area Refueling Point (FARP) Operations.
   12.4.3. Aircrew Dash One Preflight Inspection Requirements.
       12.4.3.1. The aircrew dash one preflight inspection will remain valid until either:
           12.4.3.1.1. Aircraft ground time exceeds 48 hours (72 hours provided the aircraft is
           sealed, not flown, and documented entry control is maintained).
           12.4.3.1.2. When an aircrew assumes a -1 pre-flighted/thru-flighted (as required)
           spare or quick turn aircraft, a thorough visual inspection is required. No additional -1
           inspection is required.
12.5. Aircraft Recovery Away from Main Operating Base (MOB). The PIC is responsible
for ensuring the aircraft is turned to meet subsequent mission tasking. If qualified maintenance
specialists are unavailable, the aircrew is responsible for turning the aircraft to meet subsequent
mission taskings.
   12.5.1. The PIC is responsible for the recovery items including:
       12.5.1.1. Parking and receiving.
       12.5.1.2. Aircraft servicing, including Aircraft Ground Equipment (AGE) usage.
       12.5.1.3. Supervision of minor maintenance within local capability.
       12.5.1.4. Minor configuration changes to meet mission tasking.
       12.5.1.5. Securing the aircraft before entering crew rest.

   12.5.2. In all cases where aircrews must service the aircraft without qualified maintenance
   specialist assistance, comply with the appropriate maintenance T.O.
   12.5.3. Aircrews are not qualified to accomplish the required ground inspections. In those
   instances where maintenance personnel are not available, the aircrew will enter a red dash
   symbol in the AFTO Form 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance
   Document, updating current status that reflects that the applicable maintenance inspection
   (i.e. preflight, thru-flight, basic post-flight) is overdue.
12.6. Aircraft Structural Integrity Program. The purpose of this program is to provide a
reliable system for predicting potential or impending failures based on historical records of the
aircraft's exposure to those actions contributing to fatigue failures.
   12.6.1. On AMP and Legacy aircraft the program is monitored through the use of AF IMT
   4097, Aircraft Identification. The C-5M uses the EDS for normal operations.
   12.6.2. AMP and Legacy flight engineers will:
       12.6.2.1. Ensure all applicable sections of AF IMT 4097 are completed according to
       procedures in paragraph 12.6.3.
       12.6.2.2. Always leave a newly initiated form on the aircraft. Initiate a new form by
       completing section I.
       12.6.2.3. Keep all completed AF IMT 4097s and newly initiated form in aircraft stowage
       pouch (if available) or flight engineer station publication rack.
       12.6.2.4. Remove all completed AF IMT 4097s and turn into maintenance debrief at
       home station. NOTE: If the crew and maintenance do not conduct a formal debrief (e.g.
       first period local, mission thru-flights, debrief not available), AF IMT 4097s will be left
       on the aircraft. (Units may establish local procedures if deemed necessary to minimize
       lost forms.)
       12.6.2.5. When interflying with another wing's aircraft, the engineer returning the
       aircraft to its home station will turn in all completed AF IMT 4097s to maintenance
       debrief , note in paragraph 12.6.2.4 applies.
       12.6.2.6. When delivering an aircraft to depot or another wing, the engineer will return
       all completed AF IMT 4097s for routing to home-station maintenance documentation
       section.
   12.6.3. AF IMT 4097 instructions. Complete an AF IMT 4097 for each sortie. Do not
   complete a log for any ground operation or sortie that does not involve an attempted takeoff.
   This includes ground aborts for maintenance, operations, weather, and onload or offload
   exercises. When a sortie is terminated before an attempted takeoff, transcribe the section I
   information contained on the log to a new AF IMT 4097. Use the same log number.
       12.6.3.1. The AF IMT 4097 will be closed out after each sortie, runway abort, or landing
       on a substandard runway. The criteria in AFI 11-401 and MAJCOM supplement
       pertaining to sorties, landing, and flying time entries made in the AFTO Form 781 by the
       pilot in command apply with the following exceptions:
           12.6.3.1.1. Do not start a new log for in-flight mission symbol changes.
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                         279


        12.6.3.1.2. Do not start a new log for practice full stop landings.
        12.6.3.1.3. Start a new log when the aircraft remains on the ground more than 20
        minutes after touchdown, regardless of circumstances.
     12.6.3.2. Weights. Except for section VI, enter weights to the nearest thousand pounds.
     Always right adjust the three columns. For example, enter a weight of 94,500 pounds as
     095. For section VI, enter values in thousands and tenths of thousands, such as 94.5 for
     the above example.
     12.6.3.3. Altitudes. Enter altitude to the nearest thousands of feet in section III. Enter
     altitude as thousands and tenths of thousands of feet in section V. The decimal point is on
     the form. (EXAMPLE: Enter 24,600-feet as 24.6 in section V.)
     12.6.3.4. Accuracy and neatness are essential. All numbers and letters must be legible.
     Do not use diagonal marks (/) on zeroes.
        12.6.3.4.1. Section I, Aircraft Identification.
            12.6.3.4.1.1. Effective Date. Enter the Zulu date the form was started into the
            effective date block (e.g. yyyy-mm-dd). For each mission departure from home
            station, the AFTO Form 781J, Aerospace Vehicle-Engine Flight Document, will
            contain the correct information for the effective date and columns 1-20 in a
            special block. This information will be used for confirmation. All discrepancies
            on the AF IMT 4097 will be corrected to agree with the AFTO Form 781J.
            12.6.3.4.1.2. Columns 1-3. Aircraft tail number: Enter the last 3 numbers of the
            aircraft's serial number.
            12.6.3.4.1.3. Columns 4-8. Log number: Only one log number will be used for
            each sortie flown. Place the year in columns 4-5. Right adjust the remaining three
            digits, ending in column 8. Unused columns should contain zeroes. No dashes are
            permitted. EXAMPLE: The ninth log of the calendar year 2010 would be entered
            as 10009.
            12.6.3.4.1.4. Column 9. Normally, the letter "A" will be entered in this column.
            (EXCEPTION: Enter C when ALDCS is off; enter D when aerial refueling with a
            KC-10 tanker and ALDCS is off; enter E when aerial refueling with KC-10 tanker
            and ALDCS is on.) In instances when additional AF IMT 4097s are needed (i.e.
            aborted takeoff, aircraft remaining on the ground more than 20 minutes after an
            intermediate landing, landings on substandard runways), add a suffix letter
            beginning with B through Z with the exception of C, D, and E explained above.
            (EXAMPLE: Initial log number 05011A, aircraft aborts takeoff for a door
            warning light on--initiate new log with number 05011B. Aircraft makes a full stop
            landing with taxi back for another takeoff, but is delayed on the ground over 20
            minutes--initiate a new log with number 05011F. The mission is then completed
            after further flight. The aircraft has flown one sortie and has used one log number
            although three AF IMT 4097s are completed.) NOTE: When an AF IMT 4097 is
            initiated for a flight that is aborted on the runway during an attempted takeoff
            resulting in mission termination, the form will be completed as much as possible.
            Include the reason for the abort in the remarks section.

             12.6.3.4.2.3.1. Columns 42-44. Fuel weight: Fuel weight at engine shutdown
             or 5 minutes after final touchdown, whichever comes first, to the nearest
             thousand pounds. NOTE: This entry and the fuel entry (columns 30-32) are
             extremely important and must be accurate. The chronological event (cruise
             periods, touch-and-go (T&G), intermediate full stops and takeoffs) fuel
             weight is computed using the initial takeoff and final landing fuel weight.
             12.6.3.4.2.3.2. Columns 45-48. Time Z: Sortie landing time as recorded on
             the AFTO Form 781. EXCEPTION: see paragraph 12.6.3.1.

               landing in the remarks section.
               12.6.3.4.2.3.4. Column 53. Substandard runway: Enter an "X" if the runway
               is not asphalt or concrete.
               12.6.3.4.2.3.5. Column 54. Fuel sequencing: Enter "S" for standard fuel
               sequence; enter "N" for non-standard fuel sequence. When "N" is entered,
               make an entry in the remarks block to indicate fuel quantity in each tank
               containing fuel, and the total flight time spent in non-standard configuration.
        12.6.3.4.3. Section III, Flight Profile Data:
           12.6.3.4.3.1. This section allows for four separate cruise periods. Do not enter
           temporary cruise periods of less than 15 minutes (due to clearance changes,
           weather, etc.). Entries are required for low-level clean configuration events where
           a cruise period time and altitude is held longer than 5 minutes at 6,000-feet mean
           sea level (MSL) or lower. Neither traffic nor the climb or descent portions of the
           sortie are to be entered. These entries are to be made left-to-right in chronological
           time sequence as they occur. The first cruise period start time should begin after
           the initial climb and cruise is stabilized. (Mach and altitude stabilized). Cruise
           period stop times should be entered when one of the following events occur:
               12.6.3.4.3.1.1. Climb or descent in excess of 4,000-feet from recorded
               altitude is initiated.
               12.6.3.4.3.1.2. Altitude increases by more than 4,000 from the last recorded
               value. This may occur when multiple step-climbs (less than 4,000-feet each)
               are performed.
               12.6.3.4.3.1.3. Cruise Mach number is stabilized at 0.10 from the last
               recorded value. NOTE: Climb and descent criteria will normally govern
               when to close out a cruise period. The Mach number change criteria are
               possible during aerial refueling operations and turbulence encounters.
           12.6.3.4.3.2. Subsequent cruise periods should begin when Mach/altitude
           conditions are stabilized. The stop time for the last chronological cruise entry
           indicates scheduled cruise has ended and descent for landing follows.
           12.6.3.4.3.3. Cruise entries are not required if the entire flight remains in the
           initial takeoff airfield's traffic pattern. (See section II, columns 37-40.) However,
           a cruise entry will be required when:
               12.6.3.4.3.3.1. The traffic pattern altitude (6,000-feet MSL) is exceeded,
               regardless of time duration.
               12.6.3.4.3.3.2. Each time an aircraft departs from one base traffic pattern and
               flies to another base regardless of altitude or time duration.

12.8. Performance Data, including TOLD Card.
   12.8.1. The aircraft performance manual or MAJCOM approved computer based TOLD
   program will be used for all aircraft performance calculations. All performance data will be
   computed by a first flight engineer or higher. A second engineer may compute performance
   data if supervised by an instructor. TOLD conditions and computations will be placed on the
   TOLD Card Worksheet. EXCEPTION: The TOLD Card Worksheet printed from the
   computer based TOLD program may be used in lieu of AFTO Form 198, TOLD Card
   Worksheet.
   12.8.2. All TOLD calculations will be verified by another qualified flight engineer
   (preferred) or a pilot. Aircraft takeoff and landing gross weights will be verified by
   comparing them to the DD Form 365-4 or another independent means. One of the following
   methods will be used for TOLD verification:
      12.8.2.1. FSAS, except when GW is limited by 3 engine climb.
      12.8.2.2. TAB data contained in pilot’s checklist (1C-5A-1CL-1 or 1C-5M-1CL-1) for
      conditions listed in 1C-5A-1CL-1 or 1C-5M-1CL-1.
      12.8.2.3. T.O. 1C-5A-1-1 or 1C-5M-1-1.

   12.8.3. Runway slope calculations. When using non-DoD/NOAA airfield diagrams and
   approach plates to determine runway information for takeoff and landing data calculations,
   the aircrew must calculate runway slope since non-DoD/NOAA publications do not do this
   for you. To calculate runway slope you must extract the departure end elevation and
   approach end elevation from the airfield diagram and use the following formula:
Slope in Percent = (Departure End Elevation – Approach End Elevation) X 100
                                    Runway Length
   12.8.4. Field elevation calculations. For all TOLD calculations other than obstacle clearance,
   screen height, and “ghost obstacles” use the airfield field elevation.
       12.8.4.1. Use one of the following elevations for obstacle clearance calculations:
          12.8.4.1.1. No depicted slope. Use the lowest elevation on departure runway.
          12.8.4.1.2. Depicted slope. Use the highest elevation on departure runway.
       12.8.4.2. For screen height and “ghost obstacles” use the departure end of runway
       elevation (DER).
   12.8.5. During performance calculations, the engineer will ensure the following:
       12.8.5.1. Gross Weight (GW). Aircraft does not exceed maximum GW, zero fuel weight
       (ZFW), or center of gravity (CG) specified in aircraft flight manual. GW may be further
       restricted by operating conditions such as icing, temperature, pressure altitude, runway
       length and slope, aerodrome weight bearing capacity, departure maneuvering, and known
       limiting obstacles.
   12.8.6. Obstacle clearance and climb gradient calculations. All inputs required for obstacle
   clearance and climb gradient calculations will be provided by the PIC on a MAJCOM
   approved Departure Information Worksheet as specified in paragraph 6.16 The FE will
   calculate TOLD using SDP or Non-SDP procedures as applicable to the specific departure, in
   accordance with the Departure Information Worksheet instructions and the performance
   manual.
       12.8.6.1. Average (10 nm) AEO climb gradient. Compute using computer based program
       or enter appropriate Aircraft Performance Manual sheet 1 of the Climbout Flight Path
       (Four Engine) chart at 10 NM and intersect aircraft COF. Read height at obstacle and
       divide by 10 to obtain average AEO climb gradient.
          12.8.6.1.1. Ensure this climb gradient is no lower than required AEO climb gradient
          listed on departure worksheet. If required climb gradient cannot be achieved
          performing paragraph 12.8.5.1, calculate by entering appropriate Aircraft
          Performance Manual sheet 2 of the Climbout Flight Path (Four Engine) chart. If this
          climb gradient is equal to or greater than required climb gradient the flaps must be
          left at the take-off setting with power set at Takeoff-inflight until climb gradient
          restriction is met.

12.10. Fault Code Reporting Procedures.
   12.10.1. The fault reporting method (FRM) is used to isolate system malfunctions with a
   minimum amount of troubleshooting and provide a description of the malfunction for
   maintenance.
   12.10.2. System malfunctions, whether monitored by EDS (C-5M only), MADAR auto or
   manual faults (C-5A/B only) or observed by a crewmember, will be troubleshot using the
   Fault Reporting Method (FRM) or Fault Isolation Manual (FIM) procedures contained in
   EDS or MADAR to maximum extent possible.
   12.10.3. The manual fault code (FC) derived from the troubleshooting routine and the auto
   fault code reported by MADAR will be recorded in AFTO Form 781A along with the
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                             289


   description of the malfunction. Include any additional information required for clarification
   of the discrepancy.
   12.10.4. When documenting EDS faults, AFTO Form 781A discrepancies shall be based on

   have a FI, the AFTO Form 781A entry shall be based on the FD.
   12.10.5. Before finalizing the flight during EDS shutdown, the flight engineer shall evaluate
   each active fault to determine its validity. To facilitate evaluation of recovered faults, select
   the event log and review each fault occurring after the MFDU fault log reset during the
   preflight. After eliminating any induced and/or nuisance faults, ensure all actual faults are
   recorded in the AFTO Form 781A. A comprehensive list of nuisance faults can be found in
   the current AMC Checklist Inserts.
12.11. Weight and Balance. The flight engineer is responsible for completion of DD Form
365-4 (Form F), in the absence of a qualified Loadmaster when no cargo or passengers are on
board.
12.12. Monitoring Primary Radios. The FE will monitor the primary radio for flight
clearances, altitudes, heading changes, and radio frequencies. The FE is not required to copy
departure clearances.
12.13. Ground Refueling Procedures with Inoperative Fuel Quantity Indicators:
   12.13.1. Primary method:
       12.13.1.1. A known quantity of fuel is transferred from an adjacent tank to a tank with
       inoperative quantity indicator. The crew will transfer fuel internally to the configuration
       or sequence required prior to flight when servicing is complete.
   12.13.2. Alternate method:
       12.13.2.1. The tank with the inoperative indicator and the corresponding tank on the
       opposite wing will be emptied and will not be serviced by maintenance.
       12.13.2.2. When a single refueling unit is used, the tank with the inoperative fuel
       quantity indicator will be filled individually and prior to remaining tanks, when possible,
       within wing loading limitations.
       12.13.2.3. When a dual refueling unit is used, the tank with the inoperative fuel quantity
       indicator and the corresponding tank on the opposite wing may be filled simultaneously.
       12.13.2.4. The refueling unit shall be used to determine the amount of fuel in the tank
       with inoperative indicator.
   12.13.3. Maintenance may service aircraft to the following fuel values without the aircrew
   monitoring:
       12.13.3.1. Outboard main tank inoperative—284,000 pounds.
       12.13.3.2. Inboard main tank inoperative—281,000 pounds.
       12.13.3.3. Outboard or inboard auxiliary tank inoperative—269,000 pounds.
       12.13.3.4. Outboard or inboard extended range tank inoperative—278,000 pounds.
       CAUTION: Observe wing differential loading limits.

12.14. Wheel and Brake Procedures.
   12.14.1. If dragging wheels or brakes are suspected during taxi, deplane the scanner and
   comply with paragraphs 12.16.1.1 through 12.16.1.5 Comply with paragraphs 12.16.1 and
   12.16.2 if any portion of the fire suppression system (FSS) wheel well fire detecting system
   is inoperative.
   12.14.2. Pre-departure End-of-Runway Inspection for Overheated Brakes. Unless the aircraft
   is parked on or immediately adjacent to the takeoff portion of the active runway the aircrew
   will complete the pre-departure end-of-runway inspection as follows:
       12.14.2.1. Use the scanner and another crewmember other than pilot, copilot, or FE. The
       additional crewmember deplanes with scanner and performs scanner duties while scanner
       accomplishes brake check.
       12.14.2.2. Maintain interphone contact throughout the inspection.
       12.14.2.3. To inspect, approach directly from the front or rear of the tire, touch main
       landing gear tire and cautiously move the hand toward the wheel. Then place the hand
       near the brake to determine excessive heat without touching the brake surface. Repeat for
       each main landing gear (MLG) wheel and brake assembly.
       12.14.2.4. If any brake is significantly hotter than the majority advise maintenance
       corrective action is required. If an obviously dangerous overheated condition is observed
       do not taxi the airplane.
       12.14.2.5. If no brake is found significantly hotter than the majority of brakes, the brake
       check is satisfactory.
   12.14.3. In-flight Procedures:
       12.14.3.1. Inspect the MLG wheel wells after takeoff for evidence of heat, smoke, or
       fire. If abnormalities are detected, extend the landing gear immediately at or below 250
       KCAS/.60 Mach.
       12.14.3.2. Inspect the cargo compartment sidewall and floor areas adjacent to the MLG
       wheel wells for evidence of heat (discoloration or variation in surface temperature) at 15-
       minute intervals for the first hour of flight. Inspect hourly for the remainder of flight.
12.15. PCIU (C-5M Only).
   12.15.1. PCIU Security. The PCIU does not contain virus protection or internal security
   features to prevent loading of unauthorized software. All software loaded on the EDS PCIU
   require Computer Program Identification Numbers (CPINs). Authorized uses of the PCIU are
   described in the flight manual and also include the MILTOLD and FPM programs. The OG
   and MXG are the approving authority for all other uses.
   12.15.2. PCIU Failure. To allow data recovery after a PCIU failure, attempt to replace the
   PCIU prior to AMC power down. If the PCIU is not replaced prior to power down, the AMC
   will store all data except the .dat files created for that flight (i.e. aircraft form entries).
       12.15.2.1. Operations with a failed PCIU result in the loss of or inability to auto generate
       AFTO form 781A entries. When operating with a failed PCIU, the MFDU should be used
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                        291


     as a reference to ensure accurate manual documentation of all AFTO form 781A entries.
     The flight summary report can be printed and taken to debrief if required.
     12.15.2.2. During operations with a failed PCIU the FE shall annotate in the aircraft
     forms, all Thrust Reverser deployments including airspeed/groundspeed at time of
     deployment. For example; Engine 1, 2, 3, and 4 TRs deployed on landing airspeed 110
     knots. If deployment is during ground operations, indicate engine operation at or above
     idle. For example #1 eng TR deployed for op ck, ground speed 0, throttle at idle.
     12.15.2.3. The EDS Aircraft Structural Integrity Program is not fully functional with a
     failed PCIU. Use the AF IMT 4097 for all flights with a failed PCIU.
  12.15.3. AMC Failure. Operations with a failed AMC will be held to a minimum.
     12.15.3.1. During operations with a failed AMC the FE shall annotate in the aircraft
     forms, all Thrust Reverser deployments including airspeed/groundspeed at time of
     deployment. For example; Engine 2 and 3 TRs deployed on descent airspeed 230 knots.
     If deployment is during ground operations, indicate engine operation at or above idle. For
     example #1 and #4 eng TR deployed for op ck, ground speed 0, engine throttles idle.
     12.15.3.2. The EDS Aircraft Structural Integrity Program is not fully functional with a
     failed AMC. Use the AF IMT 4097 for all flights with a failed AMC.
  12.15.4. RMM Failure. If the RMM card fails prior to data download, attempt to replace the
  card prior to power down of the EDS and PCIU. If replacement is not practical all AFTO
  form 781A entries, TLDs, and exceedences must be reviewed and entered in the aircraft
  forms as appropriate.

                                           Chapter 13

                        CARGO AND PASSENGER PROCEDURES

13.1. General. The loadmaster coordinates loading or offloading with air terminal operations or
the shipping agency, plans loads, provides in-flight services to passengers, and supervises on
loading or off loading operations.
13.2. Responsibilities for Aircraft Loading.
   13.2.1. AMC Designated Stations:
       13.2.1.1. Aerial port personnel are responsible for selecting cargo and mail for airlift,
       promptly completing documentation, palletizing cargo, load planning (as required),
       computing load distribution, and moving cargo to and from the aircraft to meet scheduled
       departure. Before starting loading operations, they will advise the loadmaster of
       destination, size, weight, and types of cargo (classified, hazardous, etc.) to permit proper
       positioning. They will also coordinate traffic activities affecting loading and offloading,
       and assign sufficient aerial port loading personnel for cargo loading. Aerial port
       personnel are responsible for safe positioning of material handling equipment (MHE) and
       cargo to and/or from the aircraft cargo door, ramp or auxiliary ground loading ramps.
       Under the supervision of the loadmaster, aerial port personnel will prepare the aircraft for
       loading, stow loading equipment if the aircraft is not to be reloaded, physically load the
       aircraft, tie down cargo and equipment, release tie down and physically offload cargo.
       13.2.1.2. The loadmaster is responsible for aircraft preflight, load planning (as required),
       certifying load plans, preparing weight and balance documentation, operating aircraft
       equipment, and supervising cargo tie down. The loadmaster coordinates with the loading
       crew supervisor to validate the cargo against manifests, supervises and directs
       on/offloading and is responsible for safe movement of cargo into and out of the aircraft.
       The loadmaster will notify the PIC, C2, or terminal operations officer if loading
       personnel are injured or cargo, aircraft equipment, or aircraft structure is damaged during
       on/offloading. The loadmaster will brief the PIC on hazardous cargo prior to engine start.
       13.2.1.3. Loads planned by qualified load planners will be accepted by the aircraft
       loadmaster and loaded aboard the aircraft as planned, unless the load or any portion of it
       will compromise flight safety or does not comply with applicable aircraft technical orders
       or USAF/MAJCOM publications. If cargo is refused or rearranged for these reasons,
       forward all applicable information, including a copy of the load plan, to MAJCOM
       Stan/Eval through Stan/Eval channels. AMC personnel attach an AMC Form 54, Aircraft
       Commander’s Report on Services/Facilities. EXCEPTION: The loadmaster may deviate
       from load plans to facilitate ease of on/offloading of cargo and to alleviate unnecessary
       aircraft reconfiguration without submitting documentation. The loadmaster must take into
       consideration the next station’s cargo configuration requirements and will ensure the
       aircraft is in proper weight and balance limits. A new load plan is not required.
       13.2.1.4. The loadmaster is the on-scene expert and final authority for load planning and
       final authority for accepting cargo for airlift. Some loads are not specifically detailed in
       applicable directives and require the loadmaster to use his/her best judgment based on
       training, experience, and knowledge to determine the best and safest method of loading
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                            293


      the cargo. When difficulties arise, they should seek the advice of other personnel (i.e.,
      squadron, group, wing, or MAJCOM Stan/Eval personnel).
          13.2.1.4.1. Non-standard cargo/equipment that exceed limitations and is not
          contained in the aircraft loading manuals requires certification for air shipment. The
          shipper will provide a copy of the certification to the loadmaster prior to loading. If
          the certification letter with loading instructions/requirements is not provided to the
          loadmaster, the cargo will not be loaded. Contact Air Transportability Test Loading
          Agency (ATTLA) or ASC/ENFC at Wright Patterson AFB, OH, voicemail (937)
          255-2330/2547 or MAJCOM Stan/Eval for questions concerning cargo certification.
   13.2.2. At locations without AMC air terminal or traffic personnel, the shipper assumes
   responsibilities in paragraph 13.2.1.1. and provides sufficient qualified personnel and MHE
   for on/offloading. Loadmaster responsibilities and authority are the same as described in
   paragraphs 13.2.1.2. and 13.2.1.3.
   13.2.3. During joint airborne air transportability training (JA/ATT), special assignment
   airlift missions (SAAM), and USAF mobility, and contingency missions, the loadmaster can
   accept DD Form 2133, Joint Airlift Inspection Record, as valid pre-inspection of equipment
   being offered for air shipment. This form, validated by two joint inspector signatures (user
   and transporting force), may be used in lieu of applicable portions of the vehicle inspection
   portion of the applicable loading checklist. However, this does not relieve the loadmaster
   from ensuring accompanying loads are secured prior to takeoff. The DD Form 2133 will not
   be used to document preparation of hazardous materials. This will be accomplished using the
   Shipper’s Declaration for Dangerous Goods.
13.3. Emergency Exits and Safety Aisles.
   13.3.1. Cargo compartment troop doors and the crew entrance door will be unobstructed and
   operative when passengers and troops are transported in cargo compartment.
   13.3.2. Ensure that at least one unobstructed safety aisle is available in the cargo
   compartment to allow movement between the flight deck and the troop compartment. Cargo
   and loose equipment shall not be stowed on the cargo compartment walkways. NOTE: All
   passenger hand carried items must be of a size to fit under the seat and must not obstruct the
   safety aisle(s). Any items that do not fit under a seat, or obstruct an aisle way will be stowed
   with checked baggage and secured for flight.
   13.3.3. Troop compartment occupancy is limited to 40 total personnel, including
   crewmembers, when either #3L or #3R escape hatches are not fully operational. Personnel
   will not be transported in the troop compartment when either the #4 escape hatch and/or the
   #6 service door is not fully operational. The slide and associated exit shall meet the following
   requirements to be considered fully operational:
      13.3.3.1. The slide must be capable of pneumatic inflation.
      13.3.3.2. Exits must be capable of being opened with reasonable effort.
      13.3.3.3. The #6 service door guides must remain in the tracks and the door must stay
      latched in the open position.
      13.3.3.4. Emergency Exit Light installed and charging.
 294                                             AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


   13.3.4. Simultaneous Cargo and Passenger On/Off loading:
       13.3.4.1. Left side cargo compartment operations. High stairs (“Galaxy stairs”) shall be
       in place prior to stowing the troop ladder or conducting operations in the vicinity of the
       ladder.
13.4. Pre-Mission Duties.
   13.4.1. Cargo Missions:
       13.4.1.1. The loadmaster, will coordinate with aerial port personnel to establish loading
       times. Loading times that differ from the normal pre-departure sequence of events will be
       established, with PIC coordination, before the loadmaster enters crew rest. Loading time
       is governed by the type of load and complexity of loading procedures (bulk, palletized,
       etc.) not by port saturation or management of aerial port workload levels. When reporting
       for duty, the loadmaster checks in with the Air Terminal Operations Center (ATOC) or
       other designated location to obtain load brief and assist in load planning as required.
          13.4.1.1.1. Aerial Port Expediter (APEX) Loading Operations. APEX is an aerial
          port loading program directly managed and supervised by air transportation
          personnel. It provides port units the flexibility to determine the best time to load or
          off-load aircraft when aircrew support is not available. The intent of the program is to
          allow aerial port management the ability to evenly distribute port workloads. It will
          not serve as an aircrew enhancement or alleviate the loadmasters’ responsibility to
          on/off load aircraft.
          13.4.1.1.2. As part of AMC’s Velocity Initiative, APEX provides the capability for
          aerial ports to on/offload cargo without loadmasters. APEX Load Directors are
          qualified to on/offload all types of cargo.
              13.4.1.1.2.1. Load Directors have overall control until formally relieved by the
              outbound primary loadmaster. A full cargo briefing must be given by the Load
              Director.
              13.4.1.1.2.2. Loadmasters who need on/offloads for training or evaluations
              should notify ATOC upon arrival. ATOC should make every effort to
              accommodate the request.
              13.4.1.1.2.3. Loadmasters shall treat APEX loaded aircraft like any duty-loaded
              or staged aircraft. Any cargo discrepancies that cannot be corrected by the
              loadmasters in a timely manner will be reported to ATOC.
              13.4.1.1.2.4. Forward negative APEX trend data to AMC/A3VX through
              Stan/Eval channels.
       13.4.1.2. Proper cargo documentation will accompany each load. A consolidated
       statement (manifest) will be delivered to the aircraft prior to departure unless one is not
       available due to a lack or failure of the manifest processing equipment. In this case, a
       cargo listing or load plan with transportation control numbers (TCN) will accompany the
       load.
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                             295


     13.4.1.3. Tiedown equipment will be exchanged on a one-for-one basis. If this is not
     possible, annotate the AF Form 4069, Tiedown Equipment Checklist. At non-AMC
     stations, 463L pallets will normally be exchanged on a one for one basis.
     13.4.1.4. Fleet Service Checklist.
         13.4.1.4.1. Loadmasters will make every effort to ensure that the AF IMT 4128,
         Fleet Service Checklist, is signed by the fleet service representative and placed aboard
         the aircraft prior to departure.
         13.4.1.4.2. Annotate inventory changes in section III. Place item nomenclature,
         increase/decrease amounts, station, date, and reason for change.
         13.4.1.4.2. (439AW) The AF Form 4069, Tiedown Equipment Checklist and AF
         Form 4128, Fleet Service Checklist are stored in the drawer under the Aft Flight Deck
         Galley oven.
  13.4.2. Passenger Missions: Maximize seat availability on all missions.
     13.4.2.1. Manifesting. Passenger service or airfield management personnel manifest
     passengers at locations with an AMC passenger processing activity.
     13.4.2.2. The PIC and loadmaster are responsible for ensuring all passengers are
     properly manifested.
         13.4.2.2.1. (Added-439AW) Accept the passenger manifest from the Passenger
         Service Rep only after all passengers are seated and the total passengers on board
         agree with the total number on the manifest.
     13.4.2.3. At locations without an AMC passenger processing capabilities, it may be
     necessary for crews to perform passenger service functions. These functions include
     manifesting, anti-hijacking processing, and ensuring visa/passport requirements are met.
     When the aircrew accomplishes manifesting, anti-hijack-processing is completed by the
     aircrew IAW AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy (Hijacking) (FOUO).
     Do not hesitate to contact 618 AOC/XOGX, Aerial Port Control Center (APCC); DSN
     779-0350/0355, commercial; 618-229-0350/0355, if any questions arise such as who may
     travel to specific locations or pass-port/visa requirements. Aircraft operating within other
     MAJCOMs which have operational C2 over that aircraft will contact the appropriate
     AMOCC for specific details. File a copy of the DD Form 2131, Cargo/Passenger
     Manifest, with the flight plan. If not filed with the flight plan, annotate the location of the
     manifest on the flight plan IAW AFI 11-202 V3, General Flight Rules.
     13.4.2.4. Ensure both ATMs and the APU on the side used to enplane passengers are
     shut down. EXCEPTION: if passenger buses are parked directly behind the aircraft and
     passengers will be on/offloaded over the aft ramp, both APUs may be operated. A
     passenger service representative or crewmember will assist passengers at the bottom of
     the steps/stairs, and the loadmaster will assist in seating passengers. DVs, passengers
     requiring assistance, and families should be boarded first to minimize separation. Make
     every effort to seat families together. Ensure that only adult, English-speaking, physically
     capable, and willing passengers are seated in emergency exit rows. Do not seat mothers
     with infants, or children under 15 years old, in emergency exit rows.
 296                                              AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


       13.4.2.5. When children under the age of two are accepted as passengers, their sponsor
       has the option to either hold the child or place him/her in a Department of Transportation-
       approved Infant Car Seat (ICS). Although the use of ICS for children processed through
       AMC-owned or controlled terminals (including gateways) is no longer mandatory, all
       passengers (duty and space-A), regardless of age, are required to be assigned their own
       seat. This policy will provide an infant and their sponsor with a dedicated seat allowing
       the use of an ICS at the sponsors discretion; this mirrors current FAA (commercial)
       standards. The FAA has banned the use of booster seats, harnesses, and vest child
       restraints.
          13.4.2.5.1. Passengers may hand-carry their ICS. If used, secure the ICS to the seat
          using the seat belt. Adults will not hold the ICS during any phase of flight. In the
          event of turbulence or emergency landing, it is highly recommended for infants to be
          secured in an ICS. To prevent blocking an exit route, the ICS should not be used in an
          aisle seat.
       13.4.2.6. Decisions regarding eligibility or acceptance of a passenger with disabilities for
       flight need to be determined at the lowest level possible. Problems concerning eligibility
       or acceptance that cannot be resolved locally must be reported (circumstances,
       chronology, names, units, etc.) to AMC/A4T. For time sensitive problems, telephone
       AMC/A4TP DSN 779-4592 or 618 AOC/APCC.
       13.4.2.7. Download the baggage of no-show passengers and those removed from a flight.
       In the case of SAAM or exercise missions at non-AMC locations, coordinate with CRG
       or deploying unit CC to decide if downloading of baggage is necessary.
       13.4.2.8. RUSH baggage movement will be accomplished IAW AMCI 24-101V14,
       Military Airlift—Passenger Service. The loadmaster will ensure ATOC provides a copy
       of the AMC Form 70, Rush Baggage Manifest, for the shipment of RUSH baggage.
       13.4.2.9. Ensure all food items are removed from the aircraft by fleet service and
       returned to the flight kitchen if an extended delay occurs. Ensure that a copy of AF Form
       3516, Food Service Inventory Transfer Receipt, is received from fleet service to relieve
       the loadmaster of meal accountability.
       13.4.2.10. Pillow and Blanket Distribution. Hand out pillows and blankets only when
       requested by passengers. At en route locations, leave used pillows and blankets on seats
       for thru-load passengers. Do not mix used and unused pillows and blankets.
13.5. Passenger Handling.
   13.5.1. The loadmaster is a key figure in good passenger relations. The following rules
   should be observed:
       13.5.1.1. Address passengers by proper titles.
       13.5.1.2. Avoid arguments and controversial subjects, national or international politics,
       criticism of other personnel or organizations.
       13.5.1.3. Offer services or perform duties in a manner indicating a personal interest and
       willingness to help.
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                         297


  13.5.2. Comments by the loadmaster and the manner in which they are made often determine
  passenger attitudes about the flight. Always remember that passengers are individuals;
  address them collectively only when making announcements.
     13.5.2.1. Ensure crewmember’s entertainment media (magazines, DVD, etc.) are of an
     appropriate nature.
  13.5.3. In-flight Procedures:
     13.5.3.1. Passengers may move about the cabin after reaching cruise altitude and the seat
     belt sign is off; however, judgment must be exercised on the number of passengers
     allowed out of their seats at any one time. Encourage passengers to remain seated with
     their seat belts fastened. Due to concern for their safety, passengers are not allowed to
     lounge or sleep on emergency equipment. Discourage passengers from congregating
     around galley, lavatory and crew bunk areas.
     13.5.3.2. Make frequent checks on cabin temperature, passengers with small children,
     and cleanliness of the cabin and lavatories.
     13.5.3.3. Do not allow passengers to tamper with emergency equipment.
     13.5.3.4. On long flights, particularly during hours of darkness, use all possible means to
     make passengers comfortable. Dim and extinguish unnecessary compartment lights.
     13.5.3.5. Passengers may visit the flight deck only when approved by the PIC. Use good
     judgment when requesting this authority. Refer to paragraph 5.3 for further guidance.
     13.5.3.6. Passengers will not be permitted access to checked baggage.
  13.5.4. Body Fluid/Bio-Hazard Clean-Up:
     13.5.4.1. Aircrew personnel are the first line of defense when human fluids/waste
     contaminate aircraft. Because of the potential health risk to passengers and crew,
     crewmembers will immediately clean-up, to the best of their ability, all body fluids/waste
     when it does not detract from their primary duties. Loadmasters will request troop
     commanders, team leaders, or traveling companions assist with the in-flight clean-up
     whenever possible. The clean-up will be accomplished using kits provided by fleet
     service and the procedures listed below.
         13.5.4.1.1. Cordon off the contaminated area if possible.

          13.5.4.1.8. Avoid touching the mouth or face area with soiled hands or gloves. Wash
          hands thoroughly with soap and water after cleaning or clean hands with an alcohol-
          based hand gel (at least 60% alcohol) when soap and water are not available.
          13.5.4.1.9. Annotate type of body fluid/bio-hazard cleaned-up and location in AFTO
          Form 781A, Aircraft Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document.
          13.5.4.1.10. When it is not possible for aircrew personnel or passengers to clean-up
          during flight, fleet service will be notified prior to landing.
   13.5.5. Meal Service:
       13.5.5.1. Ensure each passenger receives the meal ordered by verifying the passenger’s
       AMC Form 148, AMC Boarding Pass/Ticket.
       13.5.5.2. Box Meals. After takeoff, distribute box meals to passengers who boarded at
       the previous station. This lessens confusion when flight segments are short and more
       passengers board at subsequent stations. Frozen/Cooked meals will not be accepted for
       passengers. Box meals should be served in the following sequence:
          13.5.5.2.1. Small children requiring assistance.
          13.5.5.2.2. Distinguished Visitors (DV).
          13.5.5.2.3. All other passengers.
       13.5.5.3. Do not serve liquids or hot foods during turbulence.
       13.5.5.4. When purchased meals are not furnished to passenger(s), the loadmaster will
       annotate the individual’s AMC Form 148, AMC Boarding Pass/Ticket to reflect
       reimbursement is authorized. Inform the passenger(s) they may receive refunds at the
       passenger service counter at the next station, originating location, or destination terminal.
       13.5.5.5. Complimentary snacks and beverages are authorized on Transportation
       Working Capital Fund (TWCF) funded missions (including AFRC flown missions) for
       passenger consumption only. Complimentary snacks are not authorized on JA/ATT, Joint
       Chief of Staff (JCS) exercises, or SAAM missions. The squadron or port operations
       officer will ensure snacks and beverages are placed on board when departing AMC
       stations. When departing from other stations and no snacks or beverages are placed
       onboard, the loadmaster may obtain required snacks and beverages from the local in-
       flight kitchen.
13.6. En Route and Post-Flight Duties.
   13.6.1. At stations where a crew change is made and loading or offloading is required, the
   inbound loadmaster is responsible for offloading the aircraft. The outbound loadmaster is
   responsible for planning and loading the outbound load.
   13.6.2. At crew stage points, brief relief personnel about passenger and aircraft equipment,
   any missing items, the location of through cargo, mail and baggage, and any information
   pertinent to through passengers. Point out cargo requiring special consideration (hazardous
   material, perishables, etc.). If unable to conduct a face to face briefing, leave written
   instructions with the cargo manifest or local C2.
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                            299


   13.6.3. Assist passengers in deplaning. If BLUE BARK, DVs, COIN ASSIST, or couriers
   are onboard, the loadmaster informs the traffic or protocol representative respectively.
13.7. Loaded Weapons. Troops or deadhead crewmembers will not retain custody of
ammunition on an aircraft. They will turn it in to the troop commander or PIC. Troops may
carry unloaded weapons and ammunition aboard the aircraft during combat operations.
Weapons are considered loaded if a magazine or clip is installed in the weapon. This applies
even though the clip or magazine is empty.
   13.7.1. Personnel who will engage an enemy force immediately on arrival (actual combat)
   may carry basic combat loads on their person. Weapons will remain clear with magazines or
   clips removed until immediately prior to exiting the aircraft. The troop commander will
   coordinate with the loadmaster prior to directing personnel to load any weapons.
   13.7.2. Personnel who will not immediately engage an enemy force will store basic
   ammunition loads in a centralized palletized location for redistribution on arrival at the
   objective. Magazines or clips will not be inserted into weapons.
   13.7.3. Dummy clips that can be easily identified may be loaded for training at the order of
   the troop commander in coordination with the aircrew.
13.8. Weight and Balance.
   13.8.1. Accomplish weight and balance for this aircraft according to T.O.1-1B-50, Weight
   and Balance, and Addenda A of this AFI. The unit possessing the aircraft maintains the
   primary weight and balance handbook containing the current aircraft status and provides a
   supplemental weight and balance handbook for each aircraft. The supplemental handbook
   should be enclosed in a wear-resistant binder (preferably metal), stenciled “Weight and
   Balance” with the airplane model and complete serial number on the cover or a spine.
   13.8.2. The supplemental handbook will include T.O. 1C-5A-5-2, Weight and Balance
   Manual, AFI 11-2C-5 V3 Addend A, sufficient copies of DD Form 365-4, Weight and
   Balance Clearance Form F—Transport/Tactical, and a certified copy of the current DD
   Form 365-3, Chart C, Basic Weight and Balance Record. Chart C will include the aircraft’s
   basic weight, basic moment, and center of gravity.
   13.8.3. The loadmaster/boom operator will file the original DD Form 365-4, Weight and
   Balance Clearance Form F—Transport/Tactical, at the departure airfield and maintain a
   physical or electronic copy for the duration of the flight.
   13.8.4. The weight and balance section of the unit possessing the aircraft will maintain the
   required documents.
13.9. Cargo Validation On/Offloading Procedures and Format. Use the following format
when tasked to validate a new loading procedure or when encountering any cargo you feel
requires special or specific on/offloading or tiedown procedures not currently listed in applicable
loading manuals. After completion, send through standardization channels to AMC/A3VX.
   13.9.1. General Loading Data:
       13.9.1.1. Nomenclature of item. Give military or civilian name, national stock number
       (NSN), and a brief description of the item; i.e., dump truck, medical van, etc.

       13.9.1.2. Dimensions (in inches). Length, width, and height. Rough drawing or picture of
       the unit pointing out critical dimensions, projections, overhangs, etc.
       13.9.1.3. Weight (in pounds). Gross weight, individual axle weight, or data plate weight
       if possible.
   13.9.2. Number of loading crew personnel and loadmasters required to on/offload cargo and
   their position to observe clearances, if required.
   13.9.3. Equipment and Material Requirements. Special equipment and material required to
   on/offload cargo; i.e., cargo winch, prime mover, shoring requirements.
   13.9.4. Aircraft Configuration Required.
   13.9.5. Preparation of Cargo for Loading. Components that must be removed or
   reconfigured to on/ offload cargo (i.e., helicopter struts, exhaust stacks, cabs, etc.).
   13.9.6. On/offloading Procedures.
   13.9.7. Location of Tiedown Points.
   13.9.8. Comments.
13.10. Emergency Airlift of Personnel.
   13.10.1. Apply the following procedures to ensure a safe, efficient loading method for the
   emergency airlift of personnel and aeromedical evacuation (AE) of litter patients from areas
   faced with enemy siege, hostile fire, for humanitarian evacuations, or when directed by the
   618 AOC (TACC).
   13.10.2. Emergency airlift normally is accomplished without the use of individual seats or
   safety belts. Evacuees will be seated on the cargo compartment floor and restrained with
   tiedown straps. Approximately 600 evacuees can be transported in this configuration, but can
   vary depending on individual sizes. Loading procedures and actual placement of evacuees
   will be determined by the loadmaster and PIC.
   13.10.3. The maximum altitude for emergency airlift will not exceed FL 250.
13.11. Rucksacks.
   13.11.1. The following procedures apply to loading of rucksacks. During administrative
   (training) deployments, rucksacks may be loaded on deploying vehicles or palletized.
   13.11.2. During tactical deployments into a FOB/OB, rucksacks not loaded on vehicles will
   be carried by the individuals onto the aircraft. Allocate pallet space on the load plan for
   loading rucksacks.
13.12. Flight Station and Troop Compartment Access: During loading operations, do not
place cargo in a position that will restrict the use of the flight station or troop compartment stair
ladders during flight.
13.13. Cargo and Material Handling Equipment (MHE) Issues.
   13.13.1. Lithium Batteries and Pyrotechnic Material (Class/Division 1.3G). Aircraft halon
   fire extinguishers are ineffective in fighting fires involving primary (non-rechargeable)
   lithium batteries and pyrotechnic material. Primary lithium batteries shipped as cargo or
   installed/contained in equipment and pyrotechnic material will not be accepted as cargo
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                         301


  without the shipper providing a suitable fire extinguisher(s). For non-rechargeable lithium
  batteries this may be C02, Class D, or a specialized fire extinguisher (e.g., LITH-X). Dry
  chemical agent is preferred extinguisher for pyrotechnic material. These extinguishers will
  only help reduce the intensity of the fire until the lithium and pyrotechnic material expends
  itself. Aircraft halon fire extinguishers are suitable when transporting only rechargeable
  (lithium ion) batteries. Fire extinguisher requirements for non-rechargeable lithium batteries
  and pyrotechnic material do not apply to items being hand carried by troops during Chapter 3
  operations. NOTE: Aircraft potable water will not be used as a fire suppression system for
  lithium batteries or pyrotechnic material. Water presents a hazard to electronic equipment
  located in the center accessory compartment and ARO compartment and water, in less than a
  large quantity, is ineffective.
  13.13.2. Hazardous Materials in ISU-90 Containers. Load plans must allow in-flight access
  in event of an emergency, or hazardous materials will be removed from the container. Some
  containers have built-in “HAZMAT” access panels; however, when these containers are
  utilized, any hazardous materials must be positioned to permit access through the panel.
  EXCEPTION: See AFMAN 24-204 for hazardous cargo not required to be accessible in-
  flight. Hazardous materials in the upper compartment of the container are inaccessible unless
  the adjacent pallet position is left empty to facilitate opening the doors. If the person
  responsible for the container is not on board, the key or combination for locks on containers
  must be on the container adjacent to the lock. AMC inspectors and aircrew are authorized
  access on all cargo containers placed on AMC aircraft except when waived by AMC/A3 for
  security reasons.
  13.13.3. Weissenfel MB-1 Chain and 1998 Davis MB-1 Devices. Effective immediately, the
  Weissenfel MB-1 chain will not be used. The Weissenfel MB-1 chain can be identified by
  the word W-ITALY stamped on the chain hook. The 1998 Davis MB-1 tiedown device will
  not be used. These devices can be identified by a stamp reading contract number SPO470-98-
  C-5103. Remove any Weissenfel MB-1 chain or 1998 Davis MB-1 device from the aircraft.
  Examine chained palletized cargo for these chains and devices. If they are found, replace
  them with other chains and devices. Return the chains and devices to maintenance or the
  aerial port activity.
  13.13.4. Commercial Cargo Straps. Do not use commercial cargo straps. The only
  authorized cargo straps are the CGU/1b, 5k air cargo strap, PN 1670-00-725-1437, strap,
  webbing universal tiedown, PN 5340-00-980-9277 (army version of the AF CGU/1b, 5k
  strap) and the 10,000-pound restraint assembly cargo, NSN 1670-00-406-2657.
  13.13.5. Ratchet device stamped: PECK & HALE, LLC, CGU-1/B 5000 LBS CAP. 94658
  6MRW/1465B with white unmarked strap will not be used. Remove any deficient devices
  found on the aircraft and turn them in to aerial port personnel for final disposition.

                                          Chapter 14

                                      FUEL PLANNING

14.1. General. This chapter is designed to assist aircrews in fuel planning for airland and aerial
refueling missions. The planning procedures in this chapter apply to AMC-tasked and 618 AOC
(TACC)-flight managed missions in addition to local missions. Missions should be planned at
altitudes, routes, and airspeeds to minimize fuel usage.
14.2. Fuel Conservation. It is Air Force policy to conserve aviation fuel when it does not
adversely affect training, flight safety, or operational readiness. Aircrew and mission planners
will manage aviation fuel as a limited commodity and precious resource. Fuel optimization will
be considered throughout all phases of mission planning and execution. Comply with the
following whenever consistent with tech order guidance and safety:
   14.2.1. Fuel Loads. Excessive ramp and recovery fuel adds to aircraft gross weight and
   increases fuel consumption. Do not carry extra fuel beyond optimum requirements for safe
   mission accomplishment and training objectives.
   14.2.2. Flight Planning. Aircrew and mission planners will optimize flight plans and flight
   routing for fuel efficiency.
   14.2.3. APU Usage. Minimize the APU usage to the maximum extent possible. Early
   coordination may be required to ensure external power carts and heating/cooling units are
   available.
   14.2.4. Center-of-Gravity (CG). Whenever possible, load and maintain aircraft at an aft CG
   consistent with mission requirements and Flight Manual restrictions.
   14.2.5. Engine Start. Delay engine start on all departures whenever practical to minimize
   fuel consumption.
   14.2.6. Taxi. Consider engine out taxi when permitted by Flight Manual.
   14.2.7. Departure Planning. If winds allow, consider use of opposite direction runway to
   reduce taxi and/or expedite departure routing.
   14.2.8. Takeoff. Consider a rolling takeoff as well as reduced power when able. This saves
   fuel and engine wear. Clean up on schedule and do not delay gear and flap retraction.
   14.2.9. Climb/Descent. In-flight procedures such as climb/descent profiles and power
   settings should also be considered for efficient fuel usage. Constant descent arrivals should
   be performed when able.
   14.2.10. Weather Deviations. Attempt to coordinate for off-course deviation early so gross
   maneuvering is not required.
   14.2.11. Cruise techniques. Attempt to trim the aircraft and match throttle settings whenever
   possible. Fly fuel efficient speeds and altitudes to the maximum extent possible.
   14.2.12. Approach. Fly the most direct routing to arrival approach consistent with mission
   requirements. Partial flap approaches should be considered if landing performance allows.
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                            303


   14.2.13. Holding. If holding is required, hold clean at the most fuel efficient altitude and
   request a large holding pattern. Hold at endurance or performance manual recommended
   holding speeds, conditions permitting.
   14.2.14. Parking. Consider using shortest taxi route and avoid double blocking when able.
14.3. Fuel Planning Procedures. Aircrew should employ the following aviation fuel
optimization measures without compromising flight safety or jeopardizing mission/training
accomplishment:
   14.3.1. Plan a 45-minute fuel reserve at destination or alternate (when an alternate is
   required).
   14.3.2. Plan fuel to an alternate only when AFI 11-202V3 or AFI 11-2C-5V3 requires the
   filing of an alternate.
      14.3.2.1. When only one alternate is required, use the closest suitable airfield meeting
      mission requirements (such as special requirements for hazmat or patients) and 11-202V3
      weather criteria.
      14.3.2.2. If two alternates are required, use the two closest suitable airfields meeting 11-
      202V3 weather criteria and fuel plan to the more distant of the two.
      14.3.2.3. When selecting an alternate, suitable military airfields are preferred if within 75
      nautical miles of destination.
      14.3.2.4. The practice of selecting an alternate in another weather system or selecting an
      alternate based on maintenance capability will not be used.
      14.3.2.5. For remote destinations, holding is authorized in lieu of an alternate airport. In
      such situations, use 2+00 hrs reserve fuel (1+15 holding in lieu of an alternate and 0+45
      reserve).
   14.3.3. For all missions other than local training missions, calculate 15 minutes of
   contingency fuel using destination (or alternate, if appropriate) gross weights. Local training
   missions are not required to carry contingency fuel. If contingency fuel is carried on local
   training missions, it should not exceed 15 minutes. Contingency fuel is not considered
   reserve fuel since it can be consumed at any point during the mission. Contingency fuel will
   be included in the initial Required Ramp Fuel Load (RRFL) calculation.
      14.3.3.1. AMC’s ACFP will calculate reserves and contingency fuel as holding fuel.
      Computer flight plans will have 1+00 holding when combining 0+45 reserve and 0+15
      contingency fuel (for remote destinations ACFP will plan 2+00 holding, plus 15 minutes
      contingency).
      14.3.3.2. Reserve and contingency fuel will be computed using consumption rates
      providing maximum endurance at 10,000 feet MSL at destination gross weight. If an
      alternate is required, compute using weight at alternate destination. When computing
      reserve fuel for remote destinations, use consumption rates providing maximum
      endurance at 20,000 feet MSL.
   14.3.4. Using all available planning tools and guidance in this chapter, PICs will determine
   the RRFL. When actual fuel load exceeds the RRFL by more than 5,000 lbs, defuel the
   aircraft to the RRFL.
 304                                             AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


       14.3.4.1. When there is a conflict between an on-time departure and defueling, the 618
       AOC (TACC) deputy director of operations (DDO) or MAJCOM C2 equivalent will
       determine which takes precedence. The OG/CC will make this determination when
       serving as execution authority for the mission.
14.3.5. Tankering fuel for convenience is prohibited. MAJCOM C2 or 618 AOC (TACC)-
sanctioned tankered fuel is deemed operationally necessary, and will be included in the RRFL.
       14.3.5.1. Force Extension/AAR. If during mission planning it is determined that
       scheduled AAR is not needed for operational or training purposes, attempt to get it
       cancelled through appropriate C2 channels.
14.4. Computer Flight Plan (CFP) & Advanced Computer Flight Planning (ACFP).
   14.4.1. The Flight Manager uses the AMC approved ACFP system to create and calculate
   the CFP included in the Departure Papers. CFPs are optimized for en route weather, winds
   and temperature. Therefore, changing altitudes and accepting direct routing may actually
   degrade fuel efficiency.
   14.4.2. Validate the CFP by confirming the correct MDS, routing, cargo and passenger
   weight (within 10,000 lbs), and winds are valid during the expected flight time. If the
   computer flight plan does not meet these criteria the FM will provide a new computer flight
   plan.
14.4.3. Fuel savings may be further optimized by using Mission Index Flying (MIF) profiles,
and should be used to the maximum extent possible when able.
14.5. Fuel Requirements. This section augments AFI 11-202V3 fuel requirements.
   14.5.1. Fuel Cards. With a valid CFP, manual fuel cards are not required. AC’s are
   responsible for verifying fuel requirements prior to flight. Inflight, AC’s will periodically
   verify that the fuel remaining is sufficient.
       14.5.1.1. If a CFP is unobtainable, complete a manual fuel plan (AF IMT 4052 or 4053)
       using guidance in this AFI, Table 14.1, in conjunction with AMCPAM 11-2 or TO 1C-
       5M-1-1.
       14.5.1.2. AMC has determined that ACFP is extremely accurate in calculating fuel burn.
       To verify fuel requirements, the AC will ensure that the CFP is valid IAW paragraph
       14.4.2, and may use additional means of verification as appropriate.
       14.5.1.3. In flight, the AC will periodically check the Fuel Remaining. If it becomes
       apparent that the actual fuel remaining is less than the calculated Fuel Remaining on the
       CFP or manual fuel card, consider diverting.
           14.5.1.3.1. Fuel divert when the aircraft commander determines any “11-202v3 Fuel
           Reserve” fuel will likely be burned (0+45 or 2+00 at remote destinations). Do not
           divert using hydraulic heat exchanger operation as justification.

                             Contingency is fuel to compensate for unforeseen
                             circumstances during any phase of flight (i.e. unforecasted
                             weather, launch delay, etc). Contingency fuel should NOT be
                             considered reserve fuel or part of the minimum landing fuel.
                             Local training missions are not required to have contingency
                             fuel.

                                       Tankered fuel is additional fuel carried through a primary
                                       destination for use on a subsequent leg. Although tankering
                                       fuel for convenience is prohibited, 618 AOC (TACC)-
                                       sanctioned tankered fuel is deemed operationally necessary,
                                       and will be included in the required ramp fuel load. Add fuel
                                       when fuel is unavailable at en route stops, compressed
   STORED FUEL                         ground times during single day, multi-sortie missions
      (Block 7B)                       preclude refueling, or if en route refueling would delay or be
                                       detrimental to mission accomplishment. NOTE: When
                                       deemed financially prudent by the aircrew or mission
                                       planners, aircrews may tanker fuel when transiting airfields
                                       without DoD contract fuel. The decision to tanker fuel should
                                       be based on careful analysis of mission requirements and
                                       limiting factors.
    TAXI AND                           When more than 15 minutes taxi time is anticipated, add 120

                                       The minimum planned landing fuel at the primary destination
                                       is the greater of:
 MINIMUM PLANNED                               18,000 lbs
   LANDING FUEL                                     or
                                               The sum of Alternate Fuel and computed “11-202v3
                                               Fuel Reserve”.

  14.5.2. Alternate Planning. Refer to paragraphs 6.18 and 14.3.2. For those missions flight
  managed by 618 AOC (TACC), flight managers will provide a route of flight to the primary
  alternate if greater than 75 miles from the destination (When two alternates are required the
  FM will use the furthest as the primary). This route of flight is only for providing an accurate
  fuel plan and is not part of the route of flight filed with ATC. If no routing to alternate is
  included, ACFP calculates a direct route to the alternate.
  14.5.3. Canned fuel loads will not be used and final servicing will be delayed until accurate
  fuel requirements are known. Aircraft commanders will not add any additional fuel without
  first discussing the reason with their FM and receiving their agreement that additional fuel is
  justified. Ensure ramp fuel is correct upon arrival at aircraft.
     14.5.3.1. When an aircraft commander believes the fuel load is insufficient to execute the
     mission contact will be made with the FM to identify and resolve the differences. When
     the aircraft commander and FM do not reach an agreement, the aircraft commander is the
     final authority for adding additional fuel. The FM will add a comment to the crew papers
     indicating the final fuel load, as determined by the AC.
  14.5.4. AAR Fuel Planning. If a valid CFP is not available, accomplish a manual fuel plan
  using the AF IMT 4052. AAR fuel planning guidance can be found in AMCPAM 11-2 or
  T.O. 1C-5M-1-1, Section 11.
 308                                              AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


       14.5.4.1. Formatting altitude. If the end refuel tanker weight is unknown, use 400,000 lbs
       for a KC-10 and 150,000 lbs for a KC-135.
       14.5.4.2. In-flight Fuel Planning. For single and multiple AAR, PICs will ensure
       recovery fuel requirements and required on-load are computed.
       14.5.4.3. Recovery fuel requirement computation. After reaching the cruise altitude and
       before AAR, estimate the fuel on board at the ARCP and compare this with the ARCP
       required fuel on the CFP, AF IMT 4052 Block 14 or Block 35(for multiple AARs) to
       ensure recovery capability from the ARCP.
       14.5.4.4. Fuel on-load confirmation. Approximately 45 minutes before each ARCP,
       complete the fuel on-load requirements to ensure sufficient fuel is obtained from the
       tanker.
   14.5.5. Variant Configuration Fuel Planning. The following procedures were developed to
   standardize fuel planning for variant configurations.
       14.5.5.1. Estimate the flying time for the configuration you have.
          14.5.5.1.1. Use the calibrated airspeed/mach limit from T.O. 1C-5A-1 or 1C-5M-1-1,
          Section 5, for the configuration you have and convert it to a true airspeed (TAS) using
          T.O. 1C-5A-1-1 or 1C-5M-1-1 (enter the chart at 25,000-feet).
          14.5.5.1.2. Use the average forecast wind factor (FWF) from the CFP to convert the
          TAS to ground speed (GS).
          14.5.5.1.3. Apply the ground speed to the total distance remaining to arrive at the
          total time en route.
       14.5.5.2. Estimate a takeoff gross weight using the following:
          14.5.5.2.1. Flights with a drag index less than 150 or a takeoff gross weight less than
          550,000 pounds.
               14.5.5.2.1.1. 30,000 pounds per hour for the first hour.
               14.5.5.2.1.2. 25,000 pounds per hour for remaining flight time.
               14.5.5.2.1.3. Determine your category I leg reserve fuel:
                  14.5.5.2.1.3.1. Cat I leg Reserve Fuel =      (25,000 pounds) (reserve time in
                  minutes)
(60 minutes)
          14.5.5.2.2. Alternate fuel: 25,000 pounds per hour.
          14.5.5.2.3. Holding fuel: 15,000 pounds.
          14.5.5.2.4. Approach and landing: 7,000 pounds.
          14.5.5.2.5. Start, taxi, and takeoff: 3,000 pounds.
       14.5.5.3. Flights with a drag index greater than 150 or a takeoff gross weight at or
       greater than 550,000 pounds.
          14.5.5.3.1. 35,000 pounds for the first hour.

          14.5.5.3.2. 30,000 pounds per hour for remaining flight time.
          14.5.5.3.3. Determine category 1 leg reserve fuel:
               14.5.5.3.3.1. Category I leg Reserve Fuel =      (30,000 pounds) (reserve time in
               minutes)
(60 minutes)
          14.5.5.3.4. Alternate fuel: 30,000 pounds per hour.
          14.5.5.3.5. Holding fuel: 20,000 pounds.
          14.5.5.3.6. Approach and landing: 7,000 pounds.
          14.5.5.3.7. Start, taxi, takeoff: 3,000 pounds.
       14.5.5.4. Using estimated gross weight, obtain a performance ceiling from T.O. 1C-5A-
       1-1 or 1C-5M-1-1.
       14.5.5.5. Determine the optimum range airspeed and compare it to T.O. 1C-5A-1 or 1C-
       5M-1-1, Section 5 limits. Use the lower of the two.
       14.5.5.6. Convert the calibrated airspeed/mach to a true airspeed using T.O. 1C-5A-1-1
       or 1C-5M-1-1.
       14.5.5.7. Use the forecast wind factor to determine an average ground speed.
       14.5.5.8. Determine the air distance for the entire route.
          14.5.5.8.1. Air Distance = (ground distance) (true airspeed) divided by (ground
          speed).
       14.5.5.9. Obtain a climb range and climb fuel from T.O. 1C-5A-1-1, and correct for
       variant configuration.
       14.5.5.10. Subtract the climb range from the total air distance.
       14.5.5.11. Determine the en route fuel requirement using T.O. 1C-5A-1-1 or 1C-5M-1-1,
       and correct for variant configuration.
          14.5.5.11.1. Fuel Required = (1,000) (air distance) divided by (air nautical miles per
          1,000 pounds of fuel).
       14.5.5.12. Determine the Category I fuel reserve.
       14.5.5.13. Compute alternate fuel.
       14.5.5.14. Obtain a holding fuel from T.O. 1C-5A-1-1, and correct for variant
       configuration.
       14.5.5.15. Approach and landing fuel: 7,000 pounds.
       14.5.5.16. Start, taxi and takeoff: 3,000 pounds. NOTE: This procedure requires the use
       of estimates to get started. The estimates are general and were developed to cover a wide
       range of situations. Consequently, you may need to run the procedure twice to refine the
       fuel load.
   14.5.6. Low-Altitude Fuel Planning.
 310                                              AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


   14.5.7. Equal Time Point, Depressurization Fuel, and Required Ramp Fuel Load (RRFL).
   ETP calculations are required on portions of routes when the total time between the Last
   Suitable Airfield (LSAF) and the First Suitable Airfield (FSAF) is 3-hours or more. LSAF
   and FSAF selected for ETPs calculated in ACFP are authorized for use in-flight. FSAF and
   LSAF are the airports closest to the coast out and coast in waypoints that meet applicable
   destination alternate requirements except weather. Forecast weather conditions for
   LSAF/FSAF (ETA from the ETP/DF +/- 1 Hour) will meet or exceed minimums for the
   lowest compatible approach or 500/1, whichever is greater. ACFP selects ETP as the point on
   the route of flight where the time to travel to either the LSAF or FSAF is equivalent, within a
   3-minute tolerance. ACFP ETP calculations use wind data, great circle distances, and cruise
   and descent times from the ETP to LSAF and ETP to FSAF.
- Crews can use the following formula to verify ACFP ETP calculations:

TIME in hours (ETP to FSAF) = DISTANCE (LSAF to FSAF)
                               (WF2 – WF1) + 2(TAS)

- If the LSAF/FSAF is not on the flight plan course, ACFP will use a point 90 deg perpendicular
from the LSAF and/or FSAF to the flight plan course to determine the total distance between
LSAF and FSAF.
   14.5.8. Depressurization Fuel. Depressurization fuel will be calculated in ACFP at FL250.
   If additional fuel is required from the ETP, then ACFP automatically adds the additional fuel
   into block 10. During all flight portions crews will discuss exercising depressurization
   procedures. Crews will calculate the fuel required to a recovery airfield in the event of
   depressurization at the ETP to determine if additional fuel must be added to the CFP RRFL
   when not accomplished by ACFP. Plan to arrive at the recovery airfield with 0+30 minutes
   reserve fuel at optimal cruise speed for the depressurization transit altitude. Transit should be
   planned at:
       14.5.8.1. 25,000 feet MSL when passenger supplemental oxygen is available.
       14.5.8.2. 10,000 feet MSL when passenger supplemental oxygen is not available.
       14.5.8.3. Plan on burning all other fuel. Local supplements will not dictate “IAF” or “top
       of descent fuel.”
   14.5.9. (Added-439AW) Local Training Fuel. Standard fuel load for 8 hours of flying
   separated by 2 ERCC’s is 200,000 lbs. Reduce this by 20,000 lbs for each canceled hour of
   flying. Additionally, defuel for lost flying due to maintenance delays when practical.

                             AIR TO AIR REFUELING (AAR)

15.1. General. This chapter establishes procedures for aircrews to air refuel the C-5 and is in
addition to procedures in the flight manual, and air refueling manual.
15.2. AAR Limitations. The following limitations apply:
   15.2.1. An AAR qualified AC, not necessarily the PIC, must on-load all mission required
   fuel during aerial refueling operations. EXCEPTION: An AAR qualified aircraft commander
   candidate on an Operational Mission Evaluation satisfies this requirement. An AC candidate
   on Line Training Mission satisfies this requirement provided he/she has completed the
   prerequisite AAR requirements detailed in AFI 11-2C5v1 and an ARIP occupies the right
   seat.
   15.2.2. Tanker Autopilot. Tanker pilots will notify receiver pilots when any axis of the
   autopilot is not used. If the tanker copilot is required to fly autopilot-off for training,
   unqualified receiver pilots will not fly the aircraft (N/A FTU). Tanker pilots will notify the
   receiver when copilot autopilot-off training is conducted and receive confirmation that the
   receiver pilot flying the aircraft is qualified.
   15.2.3. AAR Without Tanker Disconnect Capability. Without tanker disconnect capability
   means the boom operator cannot trigger an immediate disconnect. AAR will not be
   conducted after a loss of tanker disconnect capability.        EXCEPTIONS:         1. Fuel
   emergency situation.      2. Contingency missions, JCS alert, ORI or CORI, Prime Nuclear
   Airlift Force (PNAF) support missions under normal conditions when the refueling is
   essential for home base recovery, or for any mission when authorized. NOTE: When
   conducting AAR without tanker disconnect capability, limit contacts to the minimum number
   necessary to complete mission requirements. Do not accomplish boom limit demonstrations,
   or practice emergency separations while in the contact position.
   15.2.4. Manual Boom Latching (MBL) (also referred to as Emergency Boom Latching
   (EBL), Override Boom Latching (OBL) and amplifier override). This is an emergency
   procedure. Normal tanker disconnect capability and automatic disconnect limits are
   inoperative. Use of this procedure must be authorized in the mission directive. NOTE: The
   boom operator and receiver pilot will coordinate all actions as required by applicable
   directives and checklists when making AAR contacts using emergency boom latching
   procedures.
   15.2.5. Reverse AAR procedures will be accomplished for operational necessity only. Refer
   to flight manual guidance.
   15.2.6. Emergency Separations/Breakaways. Follow procedures IAW T.O. 1C-5A-1 or 1C-
   5M-1. When separation between receiver and tanker has been effected, the receiver pilot
   advises the tanker "WELL CLEAR" and states altitude passing. When the situation has
   stabilized, coordinate clearance back to precontact. Restrict all emergency separations/
   breakaways to 1000’ below individual tanker’s altitude.
   15.2.7. Practice Emergency Separations:
 312                                                AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


       15.2.7.1. Prior to the actual accomplishment of a practice emergency separation,
       coordination between the tanker pilot, boom operator, and receiver pilot is mandatory.
       Coordination will include when the separation will occur and who will give the command
       of execution.
       15.2.7.2. Practice emergency separations may be accomplished with passengers on
       board. Ensure all passengers are seated with seat belts fastened. NOTE: Practice
       emergency separations will terminate no lower than 1000’ below tanker altitude.
   15.2.8. Receiver AAR Training for Unqualified Receiver Pilots. (This includes copilots,
   aircraft commander upgrade candidates and aircraft commanders refueling from the right
   seat.) In-flight training will be accomplished under direct ARIP supervision. The following
   procedures apply:
       15.2.8.1. The receiver pilot will inform and receive acknowledgment from the tanker.
       The boom operator at the controls will be qualified for the applicable category receiver.
       (This restriction does not apply during FTU training provided the student boom operator
       is under direct instructor supervision).
       15.2.8.2. For receiver pilot initial qualification or requalification, the receiver instructor /
       examiner pilot will be in one of the pilot seats with immediate access to the controls
       through all phases of the refueling from pre-contact/astern until post air refueling.
   15.2.9. If a change of pilot control is made, the receiver aircraft will move back to at least
   the pre-contact/astern position except for immediate assumption of control by the instructor
   pilot.
   15.2.10. If a receiver seat change takes place, move back to at least 100 feet in trail of the
   tanker and to a point where the receiver pilot can maintain visual contact with the tanker until
   the seat change is complete.
   15.2.11. When conducting AAR behind a KC-135, tanker disconnect capability will be
   demonstrated by a boom operator initiated disconnect before conducting a limit
   demonstration or a practice emergency separation from the contact position.
   15.2.12. Weather Limitations.
       15.2.12.1. Turbulence: Terminate refueling if moderate turbulence is encountered.
       15.2.12.2. Visibility: Do not close from 1 NM range (2 NM for receiver or tanker
       formations) unless you have visual contact with the tankers. Discontinue refueling if in-
       flight visibility is insufficient to continue safe refueling operations.
       15.2.12.3. AAR alternate airfields must meet the criteria of AFI 11-202V3 for alternate
       airports.
15.3. Communications Failure. Aircraft experiencing two-way communications failure during
the conduct of AAR shall continue flight in accordance with the following procedures:
   15.3.1. Squawk code 7600 for at least 2 minutes before exiting the track or anchor.
   15.3.2. Aircraft that have not received altitude instructions beyond the exit point shall exit
   the track or anchor at the lowest altitude specified in the clearance for the refueling portion of
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                           313


   the flight and proceed in accordance with "Procedures for Two Way Radio Failure IFR-VFR"
   set forth in DoD Flight Information Handbook.
15.4. Operational Reporting. Air refueling command and control reporting will be in
accordance with Chapter 2 of this instruction.
15.5. Military Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft (MARSA) Applicability
for Aerial Refueling.
   15.5.1. MARSA begins between the tanker and receiver when the tanker advises ATC that it
   is accepting MARSA. MARSA is not an ICAO recognized term. If in doubt as to what
   separation is provided by ATC, or what separation the aircrew is responsible for, query the
   tanker and/or controlling agency.
   15.5.2. If MARSA has not been accepted by the tanker before the receiver reaches the air
   refueling initial point (ARIP), the receiver may be required to hold at the ARIP.
   15.5.3. Once the rendezvous is completed, headings and altitude assignments may be made
   with the tanker’s concurrence with MARSA remaining in effect.
   15.5.4. Upon completion of the rendezvous, receiver aircraft will remain within 3 miles of
   the tanker until MARSA is terminated.
   15.5.5. MARSA ends when normal separation standards are established, ATC accepts
   control at end of refueling, and ATC advises MARSA is terminated.
15.6. Altitude Reservations.
   15.6.1. An ALTRV is authorization by a central altitude reservation function (CARF,
   EUCARF, PACMARF, CARU) or the appropriate ARTCC/CERAP under certain
   circumstances, for airspace utilization under prescribed conditions. Air refueling on
   operational missions often utilizes an ALTRV under these conditions. ALTRVs may include
   all, a portion, or portions of the intended route of flight. Request and approval format can be
   found in FAA 7610.4J.
   15.6.2. PICs will ensure ALTRV approval is received prior to mission execution. ALTRV
   status may be verified through the appropriate 618 AOC (TACC) cell.
   15.6.3. Aircraft must depart within the assigned AVANA (ALTRV Void if Aircraft Not
   Airborne) time for the purpose of providing separation between altitude reservations. Normal
   AVANA will be 30 minutes. If a mission is to be delayed beyond the AVANA time,
   coordinate with the C2 authority as soon as possible. Rescheduling will normally be in 24-
   hour increments after the original schedule.
   15.6.4. Aircraft on an ALTRV must operate within the altitude, time, and areas specified in
   the approval. An ALTRV APVL authorizes the aircraft to climb or descend as specified.
   Controllers are not required to issue a climb or descent clearance for the various flight
   segments. They may, however, request that the pilot advise them prior to initiating an altitude
   change.
   15.6.5. In a non-radar environment, the aircraft shall advise ATC if actual fix timing will be
   more than plus or minus 5 minutes from the planned ALTRV en route fix estimate.
 314                                              AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


   15.6.6. File flight plans (DD Form 1801 or DD Form 175) containing ALTRVs IAW FLIP
   GP. Include the name of the ALTRV in the remarks section of the flight plan. ALTRV
   requests or approvals do not eliminate the responsibility to obtain proper diplomatic
   clearance or file flight plans.
15.7. Receiver Pilot in Command Responsibilities.
   15.7.1. Squawking normal when separation from the tanker is greater than 3 miles.
   15.7.2. Maintaining two-way radio contact with ATC until cleared to the refueling block
   altitude, established in that block, and cleared to the AAR frequency by ATC.
   15.7.3. Receiver pilots are reminded that oceanic clearances and readback are required for
   all flights within North Atlantic (NAT) controlled airspace. References for oceanic clearance
   procedures are contained in FLIP Area Planning (AP)/2 and NAT Doc 007.
       15.7.3.1. Receiver pilots will not rely on the tanker to obtain and readback oceanic
       clearance. To the maximum extent possible, receiver pilots should obtain their own,
       individual clearance from the oceanic control authority of the airspace in which they
       intend to operate, prior to entering oceanic airspace. Pilots will request oceanic clearance
       prior to oceanic entry point IAW procedures established in AP/2 and NAT Doc 007.
       Consider obtaining clearance and providing read-back prior to rendezvous and air
       refueling.
       15.7.3.2. Tanker aircraft will not accomplish clearance read back for receiver aircraft.
       Receiver PICs are responsible for ensuring that oceanic clearance is always read back,
       and acknowledged by the oceanic controlling authority, prior to entering oceanic
       airspace.
15.8. Tanker Pilot in Command Responsibilities. Tanker ACs are responsible for:
   15.8.1. Remaining within the protected lateral, longitudinal, and vertical airspace of the
   refueling track or anchor including orbit patterns.
   15.8.2. Notifying the appropriate ATC facility of all altitudes vacated and not anticipated for
   further use by refueling aircraft. Such altitudes shall not be reoccupied without further ATC
   clearance.
   15.8.3. Receiver navigation, regardless of the number of tankers or receivers, after
   rendezvous completion through completion of refueling operations (AAR and MARSA have
   been terminated) except when under control responsibility of a military radar facility while in
   an anchor area.
   15.8.4. Maintaining communications with the appropriate ATC facility. All communications
   during refueling operations, including those concerning the receivers, shall be between the
   ATC facility or military radar unit and tanker. To the extent practical, receivers shall
   establish communications with the tanker prior to or when departing the ARIP on the
   specified AAR frequency. The tanker shall assume position reporting responsibility for the
   receivers upon rendezvous completion.
   15.8.5. Coordinating altitude and route clearance:
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                            315


       15.8.5.1. From the ATC facility for receivers and tanker at least 5 minutes prior to
       refueling completion except when both aircraft are operating on an approved altitude
       reservation (ALTRV).
       15.8.5.2. Through the radar controller when operating in refueling anchors with military
       ground radar. At least 5 minutes prior to completing refueling operations, the military
       radar facility shall forward requests to the assigned ATC facility and subsequently relay
       ATC clearances for the tanker and receiver aircraft from the ATC facility.
       15.8.5.3. Tanker aircrews should not normally obtain oceanic clearances for receiver
       aircraft intending to operate in NAT oceanic airspace. This is a receiver AC
       responsibility.
       15.8.5.4. Tanker aircrews will not read back receiver aircraft oceanic clearance. This is a
       receiver PIC responsibility.
   15.8.6. Vertically position aircraft prior to reaching the planned exit point, to facilitate the
   safe and efficient transfer of separation responsibility from the military, under the provisions
   of MARSA, to the ATC facility on completion of refueling operations. Vertical separation of
   receivers and tankers shall be accomplished within the assigned altitudes.
   15.8.7. Providing each receiver, upon request, with the aircraft's position at the completion
   of refueling operations. Additional information concerning amendments or changes to the
   receiver's ATC clearance shall also be provided as appropriate.
   15.8.8. Coordinating all refueling formation operations to ensure all aircraft are in proper
   post air refueling formation prior to cell breakup. Prior to terminating air refueling, the lead
   tanker will confirm all aircraft in the formation are in proper post air refueling position with
   required lateral/vertical separation.
15.9. ATC Clearance. AAR operations are normally conducted on tracks or anchor areas
published in DoD FLIP. Operational considerations may require AAR outside published areas or
within an ALTRV. The tanker PIC shall receive specific ATC clearance from the appropriate
ATC facility for the following:
   15.9.1. Entry to/exit from assigned aerial refueling altitude block (except on an approved
   ALTRV).
   15.9.2. Altitudes requested for tanker and receiver aircraft upon completion of air refueling.
   15.9.3. Routing for each aircraft or formation flight when exiting the refueling track prior to
   or beyond the exit point, or if different from the flight plan routing.
   15.9.4. Extending the refueling operations beyond the track or anchor exit point due to
   adverse winds, mission requirements, etc.
   15.9.5. Use of altitudes in excess of those for which specific clearance has been granted (i.e.,
   tobogganing).

                                            Chapter 16

                              COMBAT MISSION PLANNING

16.1. General. This chapter provides combat mission planning guidance for planners and
aircrews, standardizing procedures for planning, briefing, and reviewing all missions. Planners
and aircrews should reference AFTTP 3-3.C-5.
16.2. Mission Planning. The first steps in planning are to analyze the tasking, gather all
pertinent information, and decide what additional support is required. Having this information on
hand before developing the detailed plan will save time in the long run. Planners will thoroughly
study en route threats, terrain, ingress and egress routes, target areas, operations and
communications security (OPSEC and COMSEC), political and cultural characteristics,
climatology, and any other factors that enhance mission success. Intelligence and meteorology
and/or climatology requirements will be identified early because this information may not be
readily available. Mission support requests will also be processed as soon as possible to allow
coordination and planning. The level of coordination is dependent on available time and means
of communication. Aircrews will be ready to operate in the joint arena with little or no face-to-
face coordination.
   16.2.1. Tasking Order Analysis. ATO contents are discussed in AFTTP 3-1. General
   Planning. An ATO will task elements of composite forces, provide mission objectives and
   general guidance, and indicate actions required by individual situations. The Air Mobility
   Element (AME) will normally publish an ATO or air movement schedule (AMS) governing
   airlift missions planned for the next 24 hours. ATOs and AMSs are normally accompanied
   by special instructions (SPINS) which provide detailed instructions for composite forces. A
   standardized ATO format for theater assigned forces can be found in AFP 102-2V1, Joint
   Users Handbook—US Message Text Format (JUH-USMTF), Air Tasking
   Order/Confirmation (ATOCONF), and AFTTP 3-1. General Planning. Airspace control
   procedures may be implemented in the ATO, SPINS, or published in a separate Airspace
   Coordination Order (ACO). Planners and aircrew will understand and comply with all
   aspects of current airspace control procedures. The following items should be extracted from
   the ATO:
       16.2.1.1. Mission number.
       16.2.1.2. Security classification.
       16.2.1.3. Tasking organization.
       16.2.1.4. Concept of operations and mission description to include type of mission,
       assault zone description, required aircraft and aircrews, and participating forces and units.
       16.2.1.5. Schedule of events (SOE).
       16.2.1.6. Rules of engagement (ROE).
       16.2.1.7. Communications & Electronic Operating Instructions (CEOI).
       16.2.1.8. Special Instructions (SPINS).
       16.2.1.9. Command and control instructions.
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                              317


       16.2.1.10. Scheduled airlift support (e.g. JSEAD, AWACS, ABCCC, CAP, etc.).
       16.2.1.11. Airspace management procedures, to include IFF/squawks, airspace control
       center coordination (e.g. ALCC, TACS, AAGS, ATAF), air defense network procedures,
       prohibited/ restricted area procedures, and route de-confliction.
   16.2.2. Air Movement Table (AMT). The DIRMOBFOR’s transportation staff should
   develop an AMT as an appendix to the ATO to list equipment and personnel that constitute
   each aircraft load. An abbreviated ATO or FRAG may be issued to subordinate units to
   further refine the ATO and air movement plan.
   16.2.3. Schedule of Events. After receiving formal mission tasking, planners construct a
   schedule of events checklist to assist in keeping the mission, from planning through
   execution, on schedule. Some mission events (e.g., TOTs, available CAF support, etc.) will
   be specified in the tasking document. AFTTP 3-1. General Planning provides a suggested list
   of significant mission events.
   16.2.4. Intelligence Requirements. Current intelligence is vital. Incomplete or outdated
   information reduces the probability of success and survivability. Intelligence personnel will
   be integrated into the planning cell.
   16.2.5. OPORD. An OPORD usually covers overall concepts of operations and mission
   requirements to be flown during a future time period (such as a week or more).
   16.2.6. Meteorology/Climatology Analysis. Weather information will be included in both
   planning and briefing functions for all missions. AFTTP 3-1. General Planning contains an
   outline for meteorology/climatology analysis.
   16.2.7. Mission Support. Planners need to identify, request, and coordinate additional
   mission support above that provided in the OPORD and ATO/SPINS. The point of contact
   for coordination is the AMD and the DIRMOBFOR staff.
   16.2.8. Mission Considerations. Review mission considerations IAW AFTTP 3-3.C-5
       16.2.8.1. Evasion Plan of Action (EPA). AFTTP 3-3.C-5 Chapter 2 and AFTTP 3.3.C-5
       include suggested EPA planning information.
16.3. Route Planning. To the maximum extent possible, crews should follow guidance listed in
AFTTP 3-3.35B, chapter 2.
16.4. Low Altitude Restrictions. Low altitudes will depend upon conditions such as terrain,
threat, the necessity to avoid detection, and equipment limitations. The following minimum
altitudes are established for MAF airlift operations. FLIP/ICAO procedures, training
considerations, terrain, or operational directives may dictate higher altitudes. WARNING:
Aeronautical charts do not depict man-made obstacles less than 200 feet AGL or a change in
terrain until it exceeds the chart contour interval. The worst situation would occur if a 199-foot
tower sat on terrain with an elevation just below the next higher contour. For a TPC (1:500,000)
with a contour interval of 500-feet, this results in an uncharted obstacle existing 698 feet above
charted terrain. Additionally, the highest spot elevation on any given leg may not be the highest
terrain as in the case of gradually rising elevations. Planners will ensure accurate terrain analysis
by evaluating both spot elevations and the highest contour level. Refer to Figure 16.1 Inherent
Chart Errors. CAUTION: Some charts may depict terrain and obstacle altitudes in meters
versus feet (e.g. JOG and TLM charts in some areas of the world).

   16.4.1. Day VMC En route. Plan a minimum of 500 feet above the highest obstacle within 3
   NM or 400 ft plus one chart contour interval. If the altitude for the next leg is higher than the
   current leg altitude, climbs will be completed before the turnpoint. If the altitude for the next
   leg is lower, do not initiate descent until after the turnpoint. Legs may be segmented to allow
   flight closer to the ground. Once the obstruction is visually identified and the aircraft is
   confirmed well clear, the crew may descend to the next segmented altitude, if lower. See
   Figure 16.2
   16.4.2. Night VMC En route. Night routes flown may plan en route legs at an indicated
   altitude of 500 feet above the highest obstruction to flight (man-made obstacle, terrain
   feature, or spot elevation), or 400 feet plus one chart contour interval above the highest
   depicted terrain contour, whichever is highest, within 5 NMs of route centerline to include
   the aircraft turn radius over each turnpoint . If the altitude for the next leg is higher than the
   current leg altitude, climbs will be completed before the turnpoint. If the altitude for the next
   leg is lower, do not initiate descent until after the turnpoint. Legs may be segmented to allow
   flight closer to the ground. Once the obstruction is visually identified and the aircraft is
   confirmed well clear, the crew may descend to the next segmented altitude, if lower. See
   Figure 16.2. NOTE: Planning a route on a JOG chart, if available, may reduce night en route
   altitudes. If the route has been planned on a JOG and night altitudes are verified, the route
   may be flown with the lower altitudes when flying with reference to a TPC.
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                                319


Figure 16.2. Night VMC En route Altitude.




   16.4.3. Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA). MSA is an initial VFR altitude that provides
   additional terrain clearance while the aircrew analyzes situations that require interruption of
   low-level operations (route orientation and aircraft malfunctions or when either pilot will
   leave the seat during low-level operations, etc). An MSA will be computed for each leg or
   route segment or entire low level route. The MSA is 1000 feet above the highest obstruction
   within 5 NMs of route centerline.
   16.4.4. Minimum IFR En Route Altitude. Compute Minimum IFR En Route Altitude by
   adding 1000 feet (2,000 feet in mountainous terrain) above the highest obstruction to flight
   (man-made obstacle, terrain feature, or spot elevation) within 5 NMs of route centerline .
   This altitude should be rounded off to the next higher 100-foot increment. If the altitude for
   the next leg is higher than the current leg altitude, climbs will be completed before the turn
   point. If the altitude for the next leg is lower, do not initiate descent until after the turn point.
   16.4.5. Emergency Safe Altitude (ESA). ESA is designed to provide positive IMC terrain
   clearance during emergency situations that require leaving the low level structure. Several
   ESAs may be computed for route segments transiting significant terrain differentials or a
   single ESA may be computed for the entire low level route. To compute ESA, add 1,000 feet
   (2,000 feet in mountainous terrain) to the elevation of the highest obstruction to flight within
   22 NMs of planned route centerline.           NOTES:          1. Climbing to ESA may put the
   aircraft in a controlled (i.e., IFR) altitude structure requiring coordination with Air Traffic
   Control agencies.          2. Pressure altimeters are calibrated to indicate true altitudes under
 320                                               AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


   International Standard Atmospheric (ISA) conditions. Any deviation from these standard
   conditions will result in erroneous readings on the altimeter. This error becomes important
   when considering obstacle clearances in temperatures lower than standard since the aircraft’s
   altitude is below the figure indicated by the altimeter. Refer to the flight information
   handbook to determine correction.
16.5. Peacetime Route Restrictions. See AFTTP 3-3.C-5, chapter 2.
16.6. Navigation Chart Preparation. Mission planners will construct a master chart for
mission briefings and aircrew reference. Planners may construct the chart using computerized
mission planning systems if available. Sectional charts depict controlled airspace. Low-level
navigation charts will be annotated with any added, deleted, or changed information in the most
recent Chart Update Manual (CHUM) or supplement. In no case will CHUM coverage be less
than 22 NMs either side of the entire planned route of flight. Crews may trim charts to no less
than 10 NMs after establishing the ESA. Color copies, if available, of a master chart reduce the
probability of missing or misplotted data on aircrew charts. CAUTION: 1:50,000 and smaller
scale maps do not depict aeronautical information, may not show man-made obstacles, and are
rarely updated through the CHUM.
   16.6.1. Chart Annotation. As described in AFTTP 3-3.C-5, chapter 2.
16.7. Aircrew Flimsy. Aircrew flimsies are a standardized collection of essential operational
information required by aircrews to complete mission planning, conduct route study, fly the
mission, and comply with post-mission ground procedures and debriefing requirements.
16.8. Route Study. Crew route study is mandatory before accomplishing flight in the low level
environment. An intensive review of the ingress, objective area, and egress routing by the entire
crew leads to superior crew coordination and safe mission execution. Aircraft turns planned into
higher terrain, critical obstacles that do not meet three-engine climb performance, terrain
analysis, threat locations, terrain masking, and tactics will be discussed. Special emphasis should
be placed on the run-in and objective area for the locations of visual and radar features that will
assist in proper identification. The importance of route study cannot be overemphasized.
16.9. Tactical Aircrew Coordination. Effective crew coordination is crucial to the success of
any flight, especially during tactical operations, and will be discussed prior to executing the
mission. A convenient time for the entire aircrew to discuss who is going to do or say what,
during each phase of the mission, is during route study and/or the mission briefing. Assigning
specific in-flight duties, such as who is going to fly specific portions of the arrival and who will
make required/desired calls, will reduce confusion at the wrong time. While there is no clear cut
definition of crew coordination, the concept deals with the ability of the aircrew to handle a
rapidly changing environment and successfully perform the task at hand. This requires
maintaining a high level of situational awareness through the crossflow of information between
various crew positions. Information should be relative, accurate, complete, timely, and concise,
particularly for the objective area and threat reaction maneuvers. Crew coordination discussions
should also encompass individual technique, limitations, emergency procedures, and previous
lessons learned.
16.10. Briefings.
   16.10.1. Mission Planning Pre-Brief. The purpose of the mission planning pre-brief is to
   familiarize all crewmembers with the general aspects of the mission. The group or squadron
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                     321


   commander, combat support group staff specialists, all crewmembers of each participating
   crew, and other personnel concerned with the mission should attend. During the briefing,
   indicate what preparation has been accomplished and what is yet to be accomplished.
   Reference AFTTP 3-3.C-5 for inclusive items.

                                           Chapter 17

                                 EMPLOYMENT TRAINING

17.1. General. NOTE: Certain technical information was intentionally omitted or generalized
to keep this chapter unclassified. Users should be aware that written additions to any portion of
this document could cause it to become classified.
   17.1.1. Each unit will have a tactics ground training program developed by tactics and
   intelligence staffs tailored to the unit’s wartime taskings.
   17.1.2. Crews will follow guidance in AFTTP 3-3.C-5 when performing tactical arrivals and
   departures, or when operating into locations with a hostile threat environment, except as
   noted in this chapter.
   17.1.3. Cargo compartment observers will not remain in the cargo compartment for take-off
   and landing. PICs will coordinate observer positioning/repositioning prior to accomplishing
   the combat entry/exit checklist. Cargo compartment observers will wear protective headgear
   at all times while in a threat environment.
17.2. Tactical Airland Checklists. Combat Entry and Combat Exit checklists will be executed
at the appropriate time prior to entering and upon departing the threat or low altitude
environment.
17.3. Energy Management. Performance data will be carefully considered and energy
management is essential when planning low altitude operations. This is particularly necessary in
mountainous terrain, at heavy gross weights, at high pressure altitudes, and/or with less than full
engine power capability. Aggressive maneuvering, even at relatively high airspeeds, can place
the aircraft into an approach-to-stall condition or require a go-around. Abrupt control inputs
and/or uncoordinated flight should be avoided. These inputs are particularly hard on the airframe
and in some instances, may increase airframe structural loading beyond design limits, possibly
resulting in structural failure. Knowledge of factors that can lead to Pilot Induced Oscillations
(PIO) during the landing phase is critical. It does no good to avoid the threat successfully only to
exceed aircraft and/or pilot capabilities during the approach and landing phase. WARNING:
Uncoordinated flight reduces stall margins and can cause an abrupt departure from controlled
flight. Uncoordinated flight increases airframe structural loading and should be avoided unless
an actual threat exists.
17.4. Tactical Arrival.
   17.4.1. Rapid descents may be accomplished in accordance with the flight manual.
   17.4.2. Threats permitting, use all available aids (e.g., map reading, INS/GPS, TACAN) to
   remain position oriented.
   17.4.3. The pilots and other crewmembers as designated by the PIC share responsibility for
   en route navigation, terrain avoidance, and time control. During low altitude operations, a
   composite crosscheck is paramount for the pilots to ensure threat avoidance and navigation
   are not done at the expense of basic aircraft control.
   17.4.4. Maintain flight planned altitude using the best available altimeter setting, radar
   altimeter information, or terrain.
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                          323


   17.4.5. Any given approach offers advantages and disadvantages. The approach should
   avoid all threat envelopes. If this is not possible, reduce aircraft exposure time as much as
   possible using the proper altitude, airspeed, and flight path. The entry, slowdown, and
   approach must ensure a successful landing on the first attempt, but leave adequate margins
   for the unexpected.
   17.4.6. Planning cannot be overemphasized. Analyze environmental factors such as altitude
   winds, visibility, and weather phenomena and take full advantage of terrain. Also consider
   decision points, emergency escape plans, and alternate approaches. Decision points are times,
   positions, or events which should commit you to a specific course of action. Having
   emergency escape plans and alternate courses of action available will enhance survival.
   17.4.7. Plan approaches to the Assault Landing Zone (ALZ) IAW AFTTP 3-3.C-5 Chapter 7
   and the airfield identification procedures published in the OPORD or SPINS. Where multiple
   options are available, select the approach which best minimizes exposure to the threat while
   still allowing a high probability of landing on the first approach. Remain unpredictable. Plan
   to intercept the glidepath no later than three-quarters of a mile prior to the touchdown zone.
   For tactical approaches limit bank angles to 30 degrees below 1,000-feet AGL at night and
   400-feet AGL during day. EXCEPTION: Level flight turns during night tactical approaches
   may use bank angles up to 45 degrees no lower than 500 ft AGL. 1000 ft AGL night
   restriction still applies to final turn.
   17.4.8. Low Altitude Approaches. Use these approaches primarily when a low altitude
   ingress is necessary, e.g., radar SAMs en route to the field. All maneuvering is done at low
   altitudes. Enter these approaches from any direction at en route altitude and airspeed.
   17.4.9. High Altitude Approaches. Use these approaches when a high or medium altitude
   ingress is necessary, e.g., small arms environment, and allow some reconnaissance of the
   field as you fly over. Base initial altitude, airspeed, and heading on the threat.
17.5. Ground Operations. This section outlines procedures to follow when conducting engines
running on/off loads (ERO). Crews should spend minimum time on the ground when
accomplishing EROs. Preparation and a thorough briefing enhance your ability to operate
quickly and safely. Brief appropriate ground personnel and subsequent aircrews on unexpected
hazards encountered during takeoff or landing, e.g., dust, winds, hostile activity. Conduct EROs
according to Chapter 5. Conduct emergency airlift of personnel according to Chapter 13.
17.6. Emergency Airlift of Personnel. Conduct emergency airlift of personnel according to
Chapter 13. For airlift of patients, see Chapter 20.
17.7. Tactical Departures.
   17.7.1. Low Escape. See AFTTP 3-3.C-5 Chapter 7. Use this departure when a low altitude
   escape is necessary, e.g., radar SAM threat. Remain as low as required while accelerating to
   en route airspeed. Low escapes should not normally be planned to exceed the recommended
   maximum airspeed of 350 KCAS. NOTE: When specific threats dictate, speeds up to the
   maximum operating limits may be used. Retract flaps when clear of all obstacles and at or
   above VMFR, even if below flap retract altitude, but no lower than 400’ AGL. Climb to en
   route altitude when able as determined by the threat.

  17.7.2. High Escape. See AFTTP 3-3.C-5 Chapter 7. Use this departure when a high or
  medium altitude escape is necessary, e.g., small arms environment. Accelerate to the best
  climb speed for the conditions and spiral up to altitude remaining within the confines of the
  desired maneuver area.

                                         Chapter 20

                          AEROMEDICAL EVACUATION (AE)

20.1. Mission.
   20.1.1. This chapter applies to Air Force C-5 Aircrew, AE aircrew and all management
   levels concerned with operation of the C-5 aircraft. All operators involved in AE missions on
   C-5 aircraft will use this AFI.
   20.1.2. C-5 aircraft may be used for AE transport of ill or injured DoD members and their
   dependents. These AE missions may be directed at any time by C2 agencies. AE personnel
   will utilize the procedures in applicable AFI 11-2AE-V3 series and AFI 41-307, Aeromedical
   Evacuation Patient Considerations and Standards of Care, in conjunction with this
   publication, to accomplish the AE mission.
20.2. Operational Control and Reporting of AE Forces.
   20.2.1. AMC is lead command for AE. AMC Directorate of Operations (AMC/A3) is the
   executive agent for operational AE missions.
   20.2.2. Command and control of AE missions are the same as other airlift missions.
   20.2.3. The PIC is a qualified pilot responsible for command and control of all persons
   aboard the aircraft during an AE mission. In matters of flight safety, crew duty waivers, or
   operational considerations, his/her decisions are final (see AFI 11-2MDS-specific V3 for a
   more detailed list of PIC responsibilities).
   20.2.4. Medical Crew Director (MCD). The MCD is a qualified flight nurse responsible for
   the overall supervision of patient care and management of AECMs assigned to AE missions.
   He/she advises the PIC on patients’ conditions and the use of medical equipment that may
   affect aircraft operations. The MCD is directly responsible for the safety and medical well-
   being of patients on the aircraft and coordinates enplaning and deplaning procedures with
   supporting agencies. In matters of patient care, the decisions of the MCD are final.
20.3. Alerting Procedures.
   20.3.1. At all locations AMC C2 agency will alert the PIC/MCD. The MCD will alert the
   medical crew. The goal is to link the PIC, local AMC C2 agency and MCD before mission
   execution.
   20.3.2. When the AE crew is staged separate from the front-end crew, the MCD will contact
   AMC local C2 agency and establish alert, showtime, etc. with the C2 agency. The MCD will
   make every effort to communicate with the front-end crew any mission irregularities prior to
   crew rest. Utilize local AMC C2 agency to leave messages for non-emergency. Crew rest
   will be based on scheduled launch time. Do not violate crew rest.
   20.3.3. The local AMC C2 agency will provide PIC/MCD AE mission information when
   he/she checks on mission status. Local C2 agency will be the link between the AE crews and
   the PIC, thus permitting mission status updates to both parties without interruption of crew
   rest.
 328                                              AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


   20.3.4. AE mission requirements can change depending on clinical status of patient(s) and
   aircraft availability. There will be occasions when aircraft cannot depart (i.e. MX problems)
   or emergency patient movement that may separate an AE crew from the front-end crew. The
   MCD is responsible for communicating these changes with the PIC and local AMC C2
   agency to de-conflict problems.
20.4. Pilot in Command Responsibilities.
   20.4.1. Establish communications link with the MCD during pre-mission planning and
   throughout the mission.
   20.4.2. Brief AE crew on the mission, flight plan, flight profile, and current threat (as
   applicable). Identify armed crewmembers (as required).
   20.4.3. The PIC will fully integrate front-end and Aeromedical Evacuation Crew Members
   (AECM) into single crew throughout mission including en route transportation, dining,
   billeting, etc.
   20.4.4. Coordinate with MCD and C2 agencies for cabin altitude/flight restrictions based on
   patient requirements. When the sortie is being flight managed, coordinate flight restrictions
   with the FM if the FM provided plan needs to be modified.
   20.4.5. For missions with combined cargo and patients, coordinate with the MCD for
   loading, positioning, and egress considerations.
   20.4.6. Comply with hazardous cargo/passenger restrictions in AFI 24-101.
   20.4.7. Advise AECMs of intentions to start engines, taxi, itinerary changes, in-flight
   difficulties, and additional responsibilities of the flight crew.
   20.4.8. Transmit load messages and radio transmissions to tasking AE C2 agency as
   requested by the MCD.
   20.4.9. Brief the MCD on additional responsibilities of the flight crew.
20.5. Loadmaster Responsibilities.
   20.5.1. Assist the AE crew with aircraft systems.
   20.5.2. Coordinate emergency evacuation plan with the MCD.
   20.5.3. Operate aircraft systems, (i.e. doors, ramps, emergency exits, etc).
   20.5.4. Assist the AE crew as necessary, providing such assistance does not interfere with
   primary duties.
   20.5.5. Operate galley and prepare food and beverages for food service provided to patients
   by AECMs.
   20.5.6. Assist with aircraft configuration for AE operations.
   20.5.7. The Charge Medical Technician (CMT) is responsible for medical vehicle
   movement/positioning      around      the      aircraft.    Coordinate vehicle
   movement/enplaning/deplaning/ERO requirements with the CMT.
20.6. Aeromedical Evacuation Crew Responsibilities.
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                             329


   20.6.1. Responsible for patient clinical care activities including loading, positioning, and off-
   loading.
   20.6.2. Assist loadmaster/maintenance crew with aircraft configuration for AE operations.
   20.6.3. Install and remove medical equipment/supplies.
   20.6.4. The MCD or designated AECM should monitor interphone (headset) during flight.
   The MCD will be on headset with the PIC during critical phases of flight and during in-flight
   emergencies.
   20.6.5. The CMT is responsible for all ground operations involved with patients. The CMT,
   in coordination with the loadmaster, is responsible for vehicle movement/positioning around
   the aircraft.
20.7. Ground Operations.
   20.7.1. Engines should be shut down during enplaning and deplaning of patients.
   EXCEPTION: ERO procedures as outlined in paragraph 20.14.
20.8. Aircraft Refueling.
   20.8.1. Refueling normally begins after deplaning patients are off the aircraft and prior to
   enplaning that station's patients.
       20.8.1.1. Simultaneous fuel and oxygen servicing is not authorized.
   20.8.2. Concurrent Ground Operations. Concurrent servicing (CS) is the simultaneous
   servicing of fuel or oxygen with or without patients on board while cargo loading/unloading
   or maintenance operations are being performed. CS will not be accomplished on the C-5
   while patients are on board.
       20.8.2.1. The PIC and Chief Servicing Supervisor (CSS) shall ensure aircrew members
       and servicing personnel accomplish Concurrent Servicing (CS) per AFI 32-2001, The
       Fire Protection Operations and Fire Prevention Program, and TO 00-25-172. The CSS
       will coordinate with all personnel involved prior to beginning concurrent operations.
       20.8.2.2. Prior to starting concurrent servicing, the total number of patients, passengers,
       and crew on board the aircraft will be given to the fire department.
       20.8.2.3. A current and qualified crewmember for the type of aircraft being serviced will
       be appointed as a Passenger Compartment Monitor (PCM) and shall continuously
       monitor patients/passengers during CS. PCMs will not perform other duties during
       servicing. EXCEPTION: see MDS guidance below. AECMs and passenger service
       representatives will not serve as PCMs.
       20.8.2.4. The PCM will brief patients on emergency egress, exit prohibitions, and
       hazards. Ambulatory patients will remain seated but will not wear seatbelts during CS.
       When possible, the PCM should conduct the briefing prior to servicing.
       20.8.2.5. Loading ramps/stairs are in place for immediate use and exits (excluding the
       overhead escape hatches) are opened for egress.
       20.8.2.6. At least two qualified AECMs (one must be a FN) will remain onboard to
       observe patients and assist patients in the event of an egress.
 330                                              AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


       20.8.2.7. The PIC, designated aircrew representative, or CSS will advise PCMs and
       AECMs when to evacuate patients.
       20.8.2.8. Patients will not enter or exit the aircraft during servicing. Crewmembers may
       enter or exit the aircraft only when performing essential duties associated with the
       concurrent servicing operation. Individuals must properly ground themselves before
       boarding the aircraft.
       20.8.2.9. If cabin lights, electrical power to operate medical equipment and aircraft inter-
       phone are operating prior to refueling, use may be continued during servicing operations
       provided it does not radiate energy. (Do not turn electronic equipment on or off during
       refueling.) EXCEPTION: Only those systems, switches or electrical circuits needed to
       operate equipment to sustain life, may be turned on and used during refueling.
       20.8.2.10. Activities around the aircraft will be kept to a minimum during the refueling
       process. Onload/Offload patient and passenger baggage prior to or after refueling.
       20.8.2.11. The PCM will set the interior lighting as bright as possible to suit the combat
       environment.
       20.8.2.12. Do not use the on board toilet facilities during servicing.
20.9. Aircraft Configuration.
   20.9.1. On designated ARM and operational AE missions, configure the aircraft during pre-
   flight per TO 1C-5-9 and AFI 11-2C5 V3 Addenda A.
   20.9.2. Litter Support Provisions.
   20.9.3. Available litter spaces and ambulatory seating will depend on the aircraft cabin’s
   mission configuration.
   20.9.4. AECMs will have portable oxygen available. AECMs normally use an MA-1
   portable oxygen bottle. If MA-1 bottles are not available, PBE’s may be used as portable
   oxygen.
   20.9.5. Do not secure aircraft or medical equipment adjacent to an emergency exit in a
   manner that will prevent or impede egress.
   20.9.6. Life Preservers. Use the Adult/Child life preserver for patients.
20.10. Passengers and Cargo.
   20.10.1. The PIC, with the concurrence of the MCD, will ensure maximum aircraft
   utilization for passengers and cargo. Passenger restrictions based upon patient considerations
   will be identified when seats are released. The PIC will advise the appropriate C2 agency of
   the number seats available for passengers.
   20.10.2. Cargo and passengers may be carried with patients unless a clear detriment to the
   health and well being of the patient or passengers can be demonstrated. The decision will be
   made by the MCD, considering the need for maximum utilization of the aircraft. Refer to
   AFMAN 24-204, Preparing Hazardous Materials for Air Shipments for hazardous product
   special provisions rating. P4 and P5 rated hazardous material have no AE restrictions.
   Conflicts will be referred to the respective tasking AE command element for decision. Litter
   patients will be positioned forward of cargo pallets. EXCEPTION: If cargo is in place, and
AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014                                                            331


   the PIC and MCD agree, patients may be transported aft of the cargo. The MCD and
   loadmaster will ensure patient egress is not affected by mixed cargo/patient loads.
   20.10.3. Cargo will not be bumped except in unusual/abnormal cases, and only after the
   MCD has coordinated with the PIC and notified the tasking AE command element.
   20.10.4. Do not move ambulatory patients to litters in order to provide seating for additional
   patients or passengers.
   20.10.5. Patient Therapeutic Liquid Oxygen (PT LOX) may be transported for positioning
   and de-positioning AE Crews. A maximum of 25 PTLOX serviced units may be transported
   simultaneously without HAZMAT certification. Processing through aerial port is not
   required. If shipping more than six PTLOX containers as cargo, do not cover with plastic.
   This will prevent potential high concentration of oxygen levels. WARNING: Ensure the
   cargo floor is free from any oil or petroleum products.
   20.10.6. AE Movement of Contaminated/Contagious Personnel. It is United States
   Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) policy that patients personnel, or casualties
   with known or suspected contamination from chemical, biological, or nuclear warfare agents
   will not be transported within the aeromedical patient movement system. Decontamination
   must be performed prior to transport to prevent the potential spread of contamination. In rare
   cases, transport may be essential to preserve life or continue critical missions. If such
   transport is deemed essential, all efforts must be made to prevent the spread of
   contamination. In these cases, prior approval must be given by the involved geographic
   combatant commanders, Commander USTRANSCOM, and the Secretary of Defense
   (SECDEF) in consultation with Department of Defense medical authorities.
      20.10.6.1. Patients with known or suspected or highly contagious disease will not be
      transported within the patient movement system. These include infections with any agent
      that may pose a potential threat to national security, require special public health actions,
      and/or have the potential to cause public panic and social disruption. Patients known or
      suspected to be infected with a highly contagious disease should be treated “in place” or
      with minimal transportation to medical authorities. In extreme circumstances there may
      be a requirement to move index cases (approximately two) for evaluation or critical
      medical care. If patient movement is required, prior approval must be given by the
      involved geographic combatant commanders, Commander USTRANSCOM, and
      SECDEF in consultation with medical authorities.
      20.10.6.2. AMC will train and equip AE crews and stage required equipment at key hubs
      to carry out these limited missions for movement of contaminated and contagious
      patients. NOTE: If AECMs are utilizing the MCU-2A ground chemical mask, an altitude
      below 10,000 feet is recommended due to reported valve failure during rapid
      decompression.
20.11. Crash/Fire/Rescue.
   20.11.1. Aircraft carrying patient(s) will be provided CFR protection per TO 00-25-172.
   When concurrent fuel servicing with patients/passengers on board a major aircraft rescue and
   fire vehicle will be available to respond within three minutes or as determined by the base
   Fire Chief. (NOTE: When servicing with JP-4 or Jet B Fuel, a major aircraft rescue and fire
   vehicle will be positioned at the aircraft).The flight crew will coordinate CFR requirements.
 332                                             AFI11-2C-5V3_439AWSUP 17 APRIL 2014


   20.11.2. At non-AMC bases, non-U.S. military bases, and civilian airfields, the controlling
   agency will coordinate the CFR coverage, as necessary. The request for CFR vehicle
   coverage may be denied. This will not prevent refueling operations from occurring.
20.12. AE Call Sign/Use of Priority Clearance. If a medical emergency occurs during flight,
and is determined by the MCD to be an urgent situation, a request for AIR EVAC Priority will
be requested. The PIC may request “AIR EVAC priority” for preferential ATC handling if a
delay will affect a patient’s well being. AIR EVAC priority will only be used for that portion of
the flight requiring expedited handling. Do not request priority for routine air evacuations to
avoid ATC delays or inconveniences. It is the PIC’s responsibility to use this option only for
bona fide medical situations that demand priority handling. Use this status judiciously.
20.13. Load Message.
   20.13.1. The MCD will complete an AF Form 3858, C-130/C-141 Aeromedical Evacuation
   Off-load Message, and coordinate for transmission of patient information to C2 a minimum
   of 30 minutes prior to estimated time of arrival.
20.14. ERO Procedures.
   20.14.1. AE EROs are not conducted on C-5s for AE missions.
   20.14.2. AECM’s may exit the aircraft to conduct ground duties if not contraindicated by
   Intel/SPINS (Special Instructions).
   20.14.3. The loadmaster will be positioned on the left side, at the foot of the ramp and on
   headset during actual on-load procedures.
   20.14.4. Baggage will be loaded on the aircraft ramp and will not impede emergency egress.
   20.14.5. If duties permit, loadmasters will assist AECMs with securing baggage.
20.15. Floor Loading Procedures.
   20.15.1. Floor loading of patients is authorized for all contingency operations when a time
   critical environment exists (i.e. non-secure landing zones, areas faced with enemy
   siege/hostile fire, humanitarian reasons, etc.), and minimum ground time is essential. Floor
   loading procedures can be practiced/trained during aeromedical readiness missions (ARMs),
   joint training operations, exercises, etc. The cargo/ramp floor will be configured with all
   rollers stowed (cargo permitting). Maximum altitude for floor loaded patients is FL 350.
   Patients will have an EPOS pre-positioned on their litter when floor loaded.
       20.15.1.1. Ambulatory Patients. If available, any cushioning material may be used for
       seating, to prevent the patient from having to sit on the cargo floor. Seat ambulatory
       patients to face forward in the aircraft. Attach a cargo tie-down strap for each row of
       patients, in a manner that it will provide forward restraint and body stability.
       20.15.1.2. Litter Patients. Refer to AFI 11-2AE V3 Addenda A for additional floor
       loading litter procedures.

                             SPARE AIRCRAFT PREFLIGHT

A3.1. (439AW) Command Post will notify Operations when the aircraft is ready for preflight.
A3.2. (439AW) A separate preflight crew will preflight the spare aircraft concurrently with the
mission aircraft.
A3.3. (439AW) If sparing two missions, the spare will be preflighted concurrently with the first
mission preflight, and monitored or sealed so as to be ready for the later mission.
A3.4. (439AW) If maintenance problems are encountered, an engineer must stay with the
aircraft until maintenance activity is completed, unless the estimated time in commission (ETIC)
is excessive and the spare is released back to maintenance by the Command Post.
A3.5. (439AW) Upon preflight completion.
   A3.5.1. (439AW) An engineer will remain with the airplane to keep the preflight valid until
   the spare is released back to Maintenance by the Command Post, or the spare will be sealed.
   A3.5.2. (439AW) If the spare is to be sealed upon preflight completion, the engineers will:
       A3.5.2.1. (439AW) Ensure aircraft is configured for Winter operations if applicable.
       A3.5.2.2. (439AW) Accomplish the After Landing Checklist, Engine Shutdown
