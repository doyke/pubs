supervisors of military personnel and civilian employees. It also applies to non-associate, ACC-
gained ANG units when an equivalent National Guard Bureau-approved and published ANG
C&SRL does not exist. It does not apply to AFRC units which are not an associate program.

been significantly revised due to recent changes in directives, instructions and guidance
governing military and civilian personnel programs, to include implementation of the new FSS
organizational structure. Commander support staff compliance items have been removed.

1. General.
    1.1. Compliance and Standardization Requirements List (C&SRL) are the primary lists used
    during Air Combat Command Inspector General (HQ ACC/IG) Unit Compliance Inspections
    (UCI) for accessing unit compliance with guidance governing each particular area of
    operations. Items in this C&SRL are defined by the HQ ACC, and ANG and AFRC (for
    associate units only) as applicable, staffs and based upon existing “by-law” requirements,
    Executive Orders, Department of Defense directives, Air Force (AF) and ACC guidance, and
    mission areas deemed critical by AF, ACC and/or ANG leadership in assessing and assuring
    unit organizational health and/or performance. The objective of the C&SRL is to identify
    deficiencies that preclude attainment of required capabilities.
    1.2. Critical Compliance Objectives (CCO) represent the highest priority of inspection items
    and are fundamentally derived from the Common Core Compliance Areas (CCCA) and the
    mission areas defined in AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities. Lower tier core and
    general compliance items may be stand alone or subordinate to a CCO. It is the intent of the
    evaluation team to inspect during the UCI 100% of the CCOs as a minimum that apply to the
    inspected unit. However, C&SRL items listed do not limit the scope of the inspection.
    Critical, core and general compliance criteria are defined as follows:
ACCDIR90-253 20 OCTOBER 2009                                                                       3


         1.2.1. Critical Compliance Objective (CCO). This is an area or item where unit failure
         to comply with established guidance could result in significant liabilities, loss of life or
         serious injury or significant mission impact. Key mission areas are:

         - Airman development programs

         - Ability to deploy forces

         - Ability to employ forces

         CCOs are shown in BOLD AND ALL CAPS FORMAT.

         1.2.2. Core Compliance Item (CCI). This is an item or area that requires special
         vigilance and is important to the overall performance of the unit, but is not deemed
         "Critical." Non-compliance would result in some negative impact on mission
         performance or could result in injury or possible litigations. CCIs are shown in ALL
         CAPS FORMAT.
         1.2.3. General Compliance Item (GCI). An item or area deemed fundamental to
         successful overall performance of the unit, but non-compliance would result in minimal
         impact on mission accomplishment or would be unlikely to result in injury or possible
         litigation. GCIs are shown in sentence case format.
