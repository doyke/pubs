                                              Chapter 1

                                    GENERAL PROVISIONS

1.1. Purpose of the Disability Evaluation System (DES).
   1.1.1. To maintain a fit and vital force, disability law allows the Secretary of the Air Force
   (SAF) to remove from active duty those who can no longer perform the duties of their office,
   grade, rank or rating and ensure fair compensation to members whose military careers are cut
   short due to a service-incurred or service-aggravated physical disability.
1.2. Responsibilities.
   1.2.1. The SAF prescribes directives to carry out provisions of Title 10, U.S.C. These are used
   to decide fitness for continued military duty; percentage of disability in unfit cases; suitability for
   reappointment, enlistment or reentry on active duty; and entitlement to disability retirement or
   severance pay.
   1.2.2. The Secretary of the Air Force Personnel Council (SAFPC) acts on behalf of the SAF.
   1.2.3. HQ AFPC/DPPD processes disability cases, establishes Informal and Formal Physical
   Evaluation Boards and controls the TDRL program.
   1.2.4. SAFPC or HQ AFPC/DPPD may make exceptions to this instruction unless specifically
   prohibited by law or DoD policy.
1.3. Eligibility for Disability Evaluation. HQ AFPC/DPPD determines eligibility for disability
processing. The mere presence of a physical defect or condition does not qualify a member for
disability retirement or discharge. The physical defect or conditions must render the member unfit
for duty. Disability evaluation begins only when examination, treatment, hospitalization, or
substandard performance result in referral to a Medical Evaluation Board (MEB). Members not
eligible for disability processing are:
   1.3.1. Members Under Court-Martial (CM) Charges. Those charged with one or more offenses
   that could result in dismissal or punitive discharge, and those convicted and sentenced to
   dismissal or punitive discharge, may not undergo disability evaluation, unless the case fits one of
   the following exceptions:
       1.3.1.1. Question of Mental Capacity or Responsibility. When a medical board questions a
       member's mental capacity or responsibility, the commander exercising CM jurisdiction
       decides whether to proceed with CM or dismiss, withdraw, or hold the charges in abeyance
       until completion of the disability evaluation. The commander sends a copy of the decision to
       withdraw or dismiss CM to HQ AFPC/DPPD, along with the mental inquiry report and other
       required records listed in AFI 48-123, Medical Examination and Medical Standards.
       1.3.1.2. Member Whose Sentence to Dismissal or Punitive Discharge is Suspended. Action
       to vacate the suspension stops disability evaluation.
   1.3.2. Eligibility for Disability Evaluation. USAF Academy (USAFA) Cadets (10 U.S.C. 1217)
   who incurred a disability on or after 27 October 2004.
   1.3.3. Members on Excess Leave. According to the Comptroller General of the United States
   (decision B-205953, 18 Jun 82), a member in this status is not entitled to basic pay and,
   therefore, is not entitled to disability benefits under the provisions of 10 U.S.C., chapter 61.
10                                                                AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006


     (EXCEPTION: Member is eligible for disability processing if in this status in order to
     participate in educational program or for an emergency purpose.)
1.4. Processing Special Cases.
     1.4.1. CM Sentence Not Involving Dismissal or Punitive Discharge. Members who are in
     military confinement are not eligible for processing until sentence is completed and they are
     placed in a returned to duty status.
     1.4.2. Unauthorized Absence. HQ AFPC/DPPD and the PEBLO stop processing a case when a
     member is absent without leave (AWOL), in deserter status, or in the hands of civil authorities
     and do not resume processing until the member returns to military control and HQ AFPC/DPPD
     determines the member is eligible for disability processing.
     1.4.3. Civil Court Action. When civil criminal court action is pending and the member is present
     for duty, the PEBLO will continue processing after the member's commander clears the member
     for appearance at the PEB.
     1.4.4. Dual Action. Process as dual action, disability cases on members with an unfit finding
     who are also pending administrative separation (including Second Lieutenants being processed
     for "not qualified for promotion"), or who apply for nondisability retirement or discharge in lieu
     of CM action according to AFIs 36-3203, Service Retirements, 36-3206, Administrative
     Discharge Procedures, 36-3207, Separating Commissioned Officers, 36-3208, Administrative
     Separation of Airmen or 36-3209, Separation Procedures for Air National Guard and Air
     Force Reserve Members. SAFPC makes the final disposition. If SAFPC does not accept the
     retirement or discharge in lieu of CM action, the CM will proceed. If the sentence does not result
     in punitive discharge, then the disability case can be processed. NOTE: Administrative action
     continues in any disability case that results in a fit determination.
1.5. Delay of Processing. Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) will not delay disability
processing for nondisabling conditions such as elective surgery. If a member needs emergency
surgery, treatment, or hospital care, consider a delay in retirement or discharge only when it could
cause a change in the disability disposition or rating.
1.6. Benefits. The Air Force disability system will not retain, retire, or discharge a member for
disability solely to increase Air Force retirement or discharge benefits.
1.7. Disability Ratings. The PEB assigns a percentage rating to a medical defect or condition
when the member is physically unfit for duty. By law, (10 U.S.C., chapter 61), the Air Force assigns
ratings from the Department of Veterans' Affairs (VAs') Schedule for Rating Disabilities (VASRD)
and implementation guidance contained in DoDI 1332.39. (EXCEPTION: Reserve and ANG
fitness/unfitness determinations as described in Chapter 8.)
1.8. VASRD Distribution. The VA sends the VASRD to HQ AFPC/DPPD. HQ AFPC/DPPD
assigns a control number to each copy and sends a copy to the PEBLOs and to evaluating boards and
staff members in the disability system. PEBLOs maintain control of the publication within their
respective MTF.
1.9. Air Force and VA Ratings. The VA administers its program under Title 38, U.S.C.; the Air
Force under Title 10. Although both use the VASRD in assessing disability ratings, a prime
difference between the two systems is that the VA may rate any service-connected condition without
regard to fitness, whereas the Air Force may rate only those conditions which make a member unfit
for continued military service (see paragraph A2.21).
AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006                                                                         11


1.10. Medical Hold. The Medical Standards Branch (HQ AFPC/DPAMM) may place a member
on medical hold when he or she is within 60 days of the scheduled non-disability separation or
retirement date and undergoing disability processing. HQ AFPC Service Retirements, AF/DPOB
(for Colonels and Colonel-selects), or the MPF must revoke the non-disability retirement or
discharge order before its effective date.
1.11. The Next of Kin (NOK) or Guardian. The NOK (in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 1513 [4]
and [5] and 10 U.S.C. 1482[C]) or guardian acts for a member when the member is mentally
incompetent or the physician determines that divulging information to the member would be harmful
to the member's well being. The NOK or guardian has the same rights, privileges, and counseling
benefits and, unless specifically prohibited, follows the same procedures as for the members being
evaluated. NOTE: For the sake of brevity, this instruction refers to the member except when the text
applies specifically to the NOK or guardian.
1.12. National Emergency, Contingencies of War, Times of War. HQ AFPC/DPPD will
establish Physical Evaluation Boards (PEBs) at designated locations in the Continental United States
(CONUS) and will announce this action by message (includes minimize).
   1.12.1. Medical facilities send their MEBs to the nearest PEB-selected location. The PEB sends
   its findings and recommended disposition to the evaluee. If the evaluee nonconcurs, he or she
   may appear before the Formal Physical Evaluation Board (FPEB) represented by counsel or, if
   the evaluee denies this option, he or she may appeal in writing to the PEB that issued the original
   findings. The member may appeal the final findings of the PEB by writing to the central review
   authority of the SAFPC at AFPC. EXCEPTION: If the Informal Physical Evaluation Board
   (IPEB) finds a member fit and recommends return to duty, no appeal process is available.
   1.12.2. The central review authority is made up of members of the current PEBs and makes the
   final determination.
1.13. Unlawful Influence. No one may attempt to coerce or, by any unauthorized means,
influence a PEB or the outcome of any disability case.
1.14. Approval by Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS). DFAS approved the
entitlements portions of this instruction under procedures prescribed by the Secretary of Defense
(SecDef) according to Title 37 U.S.C., Section 1001.
1.15. Special Orders. HQ AFPC/DPPD issues special orders effecting temporary and permanent
disability retirement (ACD series), travel orders for TDRL members (TDD), and appointment of PEB
members (ABD). The Chief, USAF Physical Disability Division, is the authenticating official.
12                                                               AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006


                                              Chapter 2

        MEDICAL TREATMENT FACILITY (MTF) PROCESSING RELATED TO
                       DISABILITY EVALUATIONS

2.1. Medical Evaluation Boards (MEB). AFI 48-123, Medical Examination and Standards,
gives the rules for competency boards and MEBs, their documentation, appropriate recommended
actions, and the disposition of evaluees and their records. In addition, the PEB requires specialty
evaluations, such as cardiology consultations for heart conditions or psychiatric consultation for
mental conditions. Documentation sent to the PEB for adjudication must not be over 90 days old
when received at AFPC. When there is a question about the member's ability to act in his or her own
behalf, or if there is a change from a prior competency determination, a competency board must be
conducted. EXCEPTION: This 90-day time limit does not apply in cases of members of the Ready
Reserve whose non-duty related impairments are being evaluation by the PEB for a determination of
fitness only under Chapter 8, Section 8E.
2.2. Role of the Medical Officers in the MEB Process.
     2.2.1. The attending physician at the medical treatment facility (MTF) will:
        2.2.1.1. Conduct the examination.
        2.2.1.2. Prepare the documents required to identify medical defects or conditions that may
        disqualify the member for continued active duty (AD).
        2.2.1.3. Refer the case to a MEB.
     2.2.2. Medical officers on the MEB will:
        2.2.2.1. Evaluate the documentation. Recommend the disposition of the MEB case and refer
        it to the approving authority as outlined in AFI 48-123.
2.3. Role of the Physical Evaluation Board Liaison Officer (PEBLO). The PEBLO will:
     2.3.1. Ensure disability cases referred to the PEB are complete, accurate, and fully documented.
     2.3.2. Counsel evaluees concerning their rights in the disability process (see Attachment 2).
     2.3.3. Maintain coordination with the member, medical facility, MPF, and HQ AFPC/DPPD.
2.4. Role of Commander and Supervisor. Except in situations of critical illness or injury in
which return to duty is not expected, a written statement from the member's immediate commanding
officer or supervisor describing the impact of the member’s medical condition on normal military
duties and ability to deploy or mobilize, as applicable, will be submitted with the documentation
required by AFI 48-123.
2.5. Hospitalization During or After Disability Evaluation. If disability processing is not
completed, the MTF must obtain authorization from HQ AFPC/DPPD before moving the member to
a VA hospital for long-term inpatient care. When the evaluee's medical condition requires continued
inpatient care after completion of disability processing, hospitalization will be at the referring
hospital, another military facility, or a VA or civilian medical facility.
2.6. Recall of Case. If a major change in the diagnosis or in member’s condition is discovered,
the referring MTF commander may recall the case for further medical evaluation and new
AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006                                                                  13


medical board or addendum, as appropriate. The commander sends a report of circumstances
and request for recall to AFPC/DPSD.
   2.6.1. DELETED.
   2.6.2. DELETED.
2.7. Expedited DES Process for Members with Catastrophic Conditions and Combat-
Related Causes. Military medical authorities, the Federal Recovery Care Coordinator,
PEBLOs, treating physicians, medical and non-medical case managers collaborate in identifying
members who are qualified for referral to the expedited DES process. The PEBLOs work to
obtain a medical declaration of catastrophically ill or injured through the DES.
   2.7.1. The PEBLO transmits the following minimum documentation to AFPC/DPSD: a
   narrative summary of care describing, at minimum, the member’s course of medical
   treatment since injury, current condition, description of the treatment plan and prognosis.
   Narrative summary must be signed by the senior attending physician. Once the PEB has
   made the catastrophic determination, processing will continue as outlined in DoDI 1332.38,
   Enclosure 9, paragraph E9.4.
   2.7.2. DELETED.
2.8. DELETED.
2.9. Referral for Pre-Separation Counseling. As soon as it is evident that a member will meet
an MEB, the PEBLO refers the member to the MPF for pre-separation counseling in accordance with
AFI 36-2102, Base- Level Relocation Procedures. Although final disposition is unknown at this
point, early counseling is necessary to satisfy requirements of 10 U.S.C. 1142.

                                            Chapter 3

                      THE PHYSICAL EVALUATION BOARD (PEB)

Section 3A—How PEBs are Established

3.1. Purpose of PEBs. A PEB is a fact-finding body that investigates the nature, origin, degree of
impairment, and probable permanence of the physical or mental defect or condition of any member
whose case it evaluates. The disability system provides for two PEBs: an Informal PEB and a
Formal PEB. If either board finds a member unfit, it recommends appropriate disposition based on
the degree of impairment caused by the disabling condition, the date incurred, and the member's line
of duty status. A PEB is not a statutory board, and there is no statute of limitations in considering
evidence.
3.2. Legal Basis for Formal Hearings. The FPEB provides the full and fair hearing required by
10 U.S.C. 1214 for members recommended for a disability discharge or retirement.
3.3. Voting Board. The PEB is a voting board and each member has an equal vote. If
disagreement occurs, the majority vote determines the issue. The dissenting member may write a
report to assist later reviewers in understanding the issues.
3.4. Training of PEB Members. HQ AFPC/DPPD trains all members before they act and vote on
disability cases. Training includes all elements of the disability system, criteria for fitness
determinations, and use of the VASRD.
3.5. The Appointing Authority for PEB Members. Permanent and alternate members are
appointed on Department of the Air Force (DAF) Special Orders by direction of the SAF.
3.6. Permanent Members of the PEB. The Commander, Air Force Personnel Center
(AFPC/CC), or a designee, assigns and appoints PEB permanent members. Appointment orders
designate the senior nonmedical voting member as PEB president, other nonmedical voting members
as personnel members, and identify Medical Corps and Reserve component members.
3.7. Alternate Members of the PEB. Alternate members serve when permanent members are
absent. The PEB president instructs alternate members on their duties and responsibilities. HQ
AFPC/DPPD and the FPEB, HQ AFPC/DPPDF, appoint and designate alternate members on orders.
AFPC/CC furnishes alternate members to the IPEB. The Commander, Air Force Military Training
Center (AFMTC, Lack-land), furnishes alternate presidents and personnel members for the FPEB.
The Commander, 59th Medical Wing, Wilford Hall Medical Center (59 Med Wg (WHMC),
Lackland), furnishes alternate medical members for the FPEB. The Lackland Staff Judge Advocate
(SJA) furnishes the alternate legal counsel for the FPEB. In acting on a PEB request for an alternate
member, the commander's decision on the availability of the member is final. Alternate presidents
should be lieutenant colonels or above; alternate medical and non-medical members, majors or
above; and alternate military legal counsels, captains or above.
3.8. PEB Composition. The PEB must have at least three voting members. When appropriate, the
permanent personnel member (if serving in the grade of lieutenant colonel or above) or the senior
alternate non-medical member may serve as president. HQ AFPC/DPPD appoints an alternate
president if neither is available. (Exception: If SAFPC approves, the informal PEB may consist of
two members--a medical and a personnel officer. If the two disagree on the findings, HQ
AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006                                                                         15


AFPC/DPPD appoints a third member to get a majority vote.). The president of the PEB assembles
the board and ensures:
   3.8.1. One of the voting members is a physician.
   3.8.2. One of the voting members is in the Regular Air Force, if the evaluee is in the Regular Air
   Force.
   3.8.3. One of the voting members is a Reserve officer (Title 10 U.S.C. 266), if the evaluee is in a
   Reserve component.
3.9. Restrictions on Membership. Voting members cannot serve on a PEB that evaluates a case
they have acted on before except:
   3.9.1. When a PEB voting member acting on a TDRL reevaluation case acted on the same case
   at the initial evaluation or an earlier reevaluation.
   3.9.2. When additional documentation has been added to the case.
   3.9.3. When a new MEB has recommended that a case again be referred to a PEB.
   3.9.4. When a higher review authority has directed further investigation and reconsideration of a
   case or when authorized by the Chief, USAF Physical Disability Division.
3.10. Self Disqualification. PEB voting members must disqualify themselves if for any reason
they believe they would be unable to render a fair and impartial decision.
3.11. PEB Locations. The IPEB is at AFPC, 550 C Street West Ste 6, Randolph AFB TX 78150-
4708. The FPEB is at 2320 Carswell Ave Ste 3, Lackland AFB TX 78236-5607.
3.12. PEB Support and Administration. HQ AFPC/DPPD exercises operational, procedural and
administrative supervision of the PEBs. However, the PEBs are attached to the base where they are
located for logistics and administrative support, and court martial jurisdiction. In addition to
providing administrative control of disability case processing, HQ AFPC/DPPD gives administrative
and statistical support to the PEB as required.
   3.12.1. The Disability Operations Branch (HQ AFPC/DPPDS) processes all disability cases on
   AD members, ARC members, and TDRL members.
   3.12.2. HQ AFPC/JA provides legal support.
   3.12.3. To ensure fairness and independent decisions in the disability evaluation system, primary
   members of the PEBs will not be rated (for officer performance report purposes) by the board
   president or another member of the board.

Section 3B—PEB Findings and Recommendations

3.13. Cases Unable to be Adjudicated. When the PEB needs more or corrected information to
evaluate a case, HQ AFPC/DPPD returns the medical board proceedings and related documents to
the referring MTF with a cover memorandum explaining why the case is being returned and what
actions to take. When returning the case to HQ AFPC/DPPD, the MTF must include a cover
memorandum telling what they did and whether they added or changed any documents. HQ
AFPC/DPPD refers a case to a different facility for more medical workup or new MEB if the PEB
considers it necessary to ensure a fair and impartial evaluation. HQ AFPC/DPPD returns cases for
any of the following reasons:
16                                                                AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006


     3.13.1. More detailed or additional documents;
     3.13.2. Further information and description of defects;
     3.13.3. Further hospitalization, another physical exam, or reconsideration by an MEB;
     3.13.4. Correction or explanation of apparent errors, omissions or inconsistencies in the records
     or supporting documents; or
     3.13.5. Noncompliance with governing directives, such as AFIs 48-123 and 36-2910, Line of
     Duty and Misconduct Determination, and this instruction.
3.14. Documenting Findings and Recommendations. The PEBs will document their findings
and recommendations on an AF Form 356, Findings and Recommended Disposition of the
USAF Physical Evaluation Board. EXCEPTION: See paragraph 3.36 for documentation
procedures when the IPEB issues a fit finding on an ARC member for a non-duty related condition.
3.15. Documenting Member's Election. Use AF Form 1180, Action on Physical Evaluation
Board Findings and Recommended Disposition, on the PEB's findings and recommended
disposition. The PEB president or board member, HQ AFPC/DPPD staff representative, or the
PEBLO may sign in block 2. For TDRL evaluations, HQ AFPC/DPPDS informs the TDRL member
of the PEB action by memorandum, and the member documents his or her election by indorsement to
the notification memorandum.
3.16. Fitness Determinations. These are the most important findings made by the PEB. The
standards and criteria for making this determination are in DoDD 1332.18, paragraph C.
3.17. Presumption of Fitness. The PEBs will presume a member fit if he or she has been able to
do his or her duty satisfactorily in the 12 months before a scheduled retirement. Presumption of
fitness applies to non-EAD ARC members only when there is a mandatory retirement date. This
presumption applies whether the member was referred to a PEB as a result of nondisability
retirement or separation processing. The presumption of fitness does not apply to a member on
Limited Assignment Status (LAS) under the provisions of Chapter 6. The presumption of fitness
may be overcome in the following circumstances:
     3.17.1. Within the presumptive period an acute, grave illness or injury occurs that would prevent
     the member from performing further duty if he or she were not retiring; or
     3.17.2. Within the presumptive period a serious deterioration of a previously diagnosed
     condition, to include a chronic condition, occurs and the deterioration would preclude further
     duty if the member were not retiring; or
     3.17.3. The condition for which the member is referred is a chronic condition and a
     preponderance of the evidence establishes that the member was not performing duties befitting
     either his or her experience in the office, grade, rank, or rating before entering the presumptive
     period. When there has been no serious deterioration within the presumptive period, the ability
     to perform duty in the future shall not be a consideration.
3.18. Ratable Physical Defects and Conditions. Disability evaluation boards assign a disability
percentage rating of zero or more to each ratable defect or condition using the VASRD and DoD
Instruction 1332.39 as guides. The boards will rate only those conditions which make a member unfit
for continued active duty.
AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006                                                                          17


3.19. Known Existed Prior to Service (EPTS) Defects or Conditions. See DoD Instruction
1332.38, part 2, paragraph E, for standards, limitations, and presumptions concerning EPTS defects
or conditions.
3.20. Line of Duty (LOD) Determinations. Chapter 61, 10 U.S.C., requires a line of duty
determination for each unfitting defect or condition. Specifically, for compensability purposes the
PEB must know whether or not the member incurred the disability as the result of his or her
intentional misconduct or during a period of unauthorized absence.
   3.20.1. Evidence in Support of LODs. This evidence may include, but is not limited to, medical
   documentation, documents verifying a period of unauthorized absence, or an LOD determination
   made under AFI 36-2910.
   3.20.2. PEB Action on LOD Determinations. LOD determinations made under provisions of
   AFI 36-2910 are material evidence considered by the PEB. The PEB cannot properly adjudicate
   a case until the completed LOD determination, if required, is in the case file. ( NOTE: Entries on
   AF Form 618 constitute administrative LOD determinations.) The PEB will direct the referring
   medical facility to begin an LOD determination under AFI 36-2910 before continuing with the
   evaluation process when:
   3.20.3. There is reasonable doubt as to the accuracy of the administrative LOD determination as
   shown on the AF Form 618; and
   3.20.4. There is no existing informal or formal LOD determination in the member's case file;
   and
   3.20.5. There is insufficient evidence from which the PEB may make its own independent LOD
   determination.
   3.20.6. Changes in LOD Determinations. Only SAF or SAF's designated representative has the
   authority to reverse LOD determinations made under AFI 36-2910. The PEB may not
   recommend a change to a line of duty determination made under AFI 36-2910 unless there is new
   and compelling evidence not considered during that process.
3.21. Absence Without Leave (AWOL). A member who incurs an unfitting defect or condition
during a period of unauthorized absence or AWOL is not entitled to disability benefits for that defect
or condition under 10 U.S.C., chapter 61. In cases involving a member who was AWOL, the record
must contain enough evidence to support a finding that the member incurred the disability during a
period of unauthorized absence. In addition to pertinent medical records, supporting evidence may
include court martial orders, duty status reports, line of duty reports, or other documents that verify
the exact period of unauthorized absence.
3.22. Identifying When Ratable Defects or Conditions Were Incurred. In most cases, for
each ratable defect or condition, the PEB must find if the member incurred the defect or condition
while entitled to basic pay. The date incurred is the date when, according to documented evidence or
accepted medical principles, the member incurred the disease, defect, condition, or injury--not the
date the member underwent medical evaluation. The following guidelines apply:
   3.22.1. Service-Incurred Defects. The PEB presumes members to have been in sound physical
   and mental condition on entering military service except for defects or conditions noted and
   recorded at time of entry. They presume any disease or injury discovered after active duty (AD)
   entry, with the exception of congenital and hereditary conditions, as having been incurred while
   entitled to receive basic pay. The defect or condition is service incurred unless a preponderance
18                                                                AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006


     of evidence shows it existed prior to service, or developed while the member was in an excess
     leave or TDRL status.
     3.22.2. Acute Conditions. The PEB regards as service incurred or service aggravated acute
     conditions occurring during active service, unless the preponderance of evidence shows there was
     no new or increased disability resulting from these conditions during active service.
     3.22.3. Conditions That Existed Prior to Service (EPTS). Certain abnormalities and residual
     physical defects or conditions, when found, require the conclusion that they must have existed
     before entry into military service or during a break in service or during a period of inactive
     service. For example:
        3.22.3.1. Congenital and hereditary conditions.
        3.22.3.2. Medical authorities are in consistent and universal agreement to the cause and time
        of origin.
        3.22.3.3. The case involves manifestation of lesions or symptoms of chronic disease existing
        from the date of entry or so close to the date that the disease could not have originated in so
        short a period of time.
        3.22.3.4. The condition is of infectious origin and is found within less than minimum
        incubation period.
        3.22.3.5. Competent civilian medical or dental sources document physical defects of
        conditions before entry into service, and the records are available to military medical
        authorities. The physical defect or condition must be such that, by a preponderance of
        evidence, it must have existed before entry into the service, or the service entrance
        examination noted objective evidence of the defect or condition.
     3.22.4. Service Aggravation of EPTS Defects or Conditions. When the PEB finds that a
     physical defect or condition is "EPTS," it then must find whether military service further
     aggravated the defect or condition. Additionally, PEBs will:
        3.22.4.1. Presume service aggravation if there is any permanent increase in severity of the
        preexisting condition occurring after the member entered into military service. Only specific
        findings of "natural progression" of the preexisting defect or condition, based on well
        established medical principles as distinguished from medical opinion alone, will overcome
        the presumption of service aggravation.
        3.22.4.2. Not consider as service aggravation the residual conditions resulting from medical
        or surgical treatment of EPTS defects or conditions. EXAMPLE: Post operative scars or
        absent or poorly functioning parts or organs.
        3.22.4.3. Consider the residuals as service aggravation if the residuals are unusual or
        unanticipated, or if the purpose of the treatment was to relieve a service-aggravated defect or
        condition.
     3.22.5. Conditions Incurred During a Period of Excess Leave. According to the Comptroller
     General of the United States (decision B-205953, 18 June 1982), a member in this status is not
     entitled to basic pay and, thus, is not entitled to disability benefits under the provisions of 10
     U.S.C., chapter 61. (exception: If member is in this status in order to participate in an
     educational program or for an emergency purpose.)
AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006                                                                           19


3.23. Proximate Result. For cases involving ARC members who incurred a disability on or before
September 23, l996, the PEB determines whether the disability was the proximate result of
performing military duties in cases involving ARC members called to active duty for 30 days or less
or performing active or inactive duty training. The PEB bases these findings on the facts and
circumstances in each case. There must be some definite causal relationship between the disability
and the required military duty. Resolve findings in favor of the member unless the preponderance of
the evidence dictates otherwise. This determination is not required for Regular members or ARC
members serving on active duty for a period of more than 30 days, or for ARC members called to
active duty for 30 days or less or performing active or inactive duty for training after September 23,
1996 if injury was caused in the line of duty.
3.24. Permanence of Impairment. The PEB determines the permanence of the impairment and
classifies it as either "Permanent" or "May Be Permanent." (See Attachment 1)
   3.24.1. Use of the TDRL. When the PEB finds a disability may be permanent in character, but
   not stable in degree, and the member otherwise qualifies for disability retirement, the Air Force
   places the member on the TDRL. The TDRL is a way to further observe unfit members whose
   disability has not stabilized and for whom the PEB cannot accurately assess the degree of
   severity, percent of disability, or ultimate disposition. The TDRL also serves as a safeguard for
   both the member and the Air Force by delaying permanent disposition for those members whose
   conditions could improve or get worse, or where the ultimate disposition could change within a
   reasonable period of time.
3.25. Percent of Disability and VA Diagnostic Codes. The PEB, on finding a member unfit,
assigns a disability percentage to each ratable defect or condition and the VA code that describes the
defect or condition. The PEB enters the percent of disability without regard to LAS or the final
disposition and uses hyphenated VA codes only when authorized by the VASRD. This provision
does not apply to ARC and Air National Guard (ANG) fitness/unfitness determinations for non-duty
related conditions.
3.26. Armed Conflict and Instrumentality of War. This determination may entitle the retired
member to certain tax and VA benefits, special considerations if later employed by the US
government and, if a Regular officer, the exemption from the requirement to forfeit a part of military
retired pay. The PEB uses the following criteria in making this determination:
   3.26.1. Armed Conflict. The PEB makes this determination only when the member incurred the
   physical defect or condition in the line of duty as a direct result of armed conflict and that defect
   or condition, standing alone, makes the member unfit. Mere presence in an area of armed
   conflict is not sufficient to support this finding. There must be a definite causal relationship
   between the armed conflict and the resulting unfitting disability. (See Attachment 1)
   3.26.2. Instrumentality of War. The PEB makes this determination only when the member
   incurred the physical defect or condition in line of duty as the result of an instrumentality of war
   during a period of war, and that defect or condition, standing alone, makes the member unfit.
   Title 38 U.S.C. 101 defines the periods of war.
3.27. Determinations for Tax Benefits. Prior to 25 Sep 75, military disability pay was excluded
from gross income for Federal tax purposes. The Tax Reform Act of l976 (26 USC, 104) provides
that, effective 25 Sep 75, disability payments are taxable unless one of the following conditions is
met:
20                                                                 AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006


     3.27.1. Service Affiliation. If the evaluee was a member of the Armed Forces (or Reserve
     component thereof), or under a binding written agreement to become such a member on 24 Sep
     75. HQ AFPC/ DPPD determines this from information in the personnel data system or other
     available personnel records, and documents it in the disposition message and retirement order
     form.
     3.27.2. Direct Result. One of the member's defects or conditions was the direct result of a
     combat-related injury. The defect or condition, standing alone, must make the member unfit. In
     all cases, the member must have incurred the disability in the line of duty, under orders (verbal or
     written) to perform duty, and there must be a definite causal relationship between the required
     duty and the disability.
        3.27.2.1. Combat-related Disabilities. The PEB will make a combat-related disability
        determination for:
            3.27.2.1.1. Armed Conflict. See paragraph 3.26 and Attachment 1.
            3.27.2.1.2. Extra Hazardous Service. An assignment to a military occupation entitling
            the member to hazardous duty pay, such as parachute, flight deck, demolition,
            experimental stress, or leprosarium duty. It includes flight duty only if it involves other
            than routine training flights, and there is enough evidence of record to show that an
            extremely hazardous duty factor was present.
            3.27.2.1.3. Conditions Simulating War. Includes any disability resulting from military
            training, such as war games, practice alerts, or riot control training. It does not include
            activities like calisthenics and supervised sports not essentially military in nature.
            3.27.2.1.4. Instrumentality of War. See paragraph 3.26 and Attachment 1. In these
            cases, the law does not require that the disability be incurred during a period of war.
            Consequently, the PEB may make a favorable determination if the member incurred the
            disability during any period of service of such diverse causes as wounds caused by a
            military combat vehicle, injury or sickness caused by fumes, gases, or explosion of
            military ordnance, vehicles, or material.
        3.27.2.2. TDRL Reexamination Cases. The initial combat-related determination is valid
        until final disposition. When removing a member from the TDRL for permanent disposition,
        the PEB makes a new determination to ensure that the combat-related defect or condition,
        standing alone, still makes the member unfit.
3.28. Categorizing Ratable Defects or Conditions. The PEB categorizes each ratable defect or
condition as compensable or noncompensable. Eligibility for disability benefits is based only on
compensable defects or conditions. (See glossary for definition.) After recording the compensable
defects and conditions, the PEB combines the percentage rating of each defect or condition as
outlined in table 1 of the VASRD. The PEB reflects any additions to or deductions from this
combined rating, such as a bilateral factor or EPTS factor, and converts the final combined
compensable rating to the nearest whole number divisible by 10. Any condition or defect that does
not affect the member's ability to perform military duty is considered not unfitting, but is noted.
3.29. Recommended Disposition. The PEB recommends one of the following dispositions:
     3.29.1. Return to Duty. Applies to all members found physically fit, except TDRL members or
     previously retired members on active duty.
     3.29.2. Permanent Retirement.
AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006                                                                        21


   3.29.3. Temporary Retirement.
   3.29.4. Discharge With Severance Pay.
   3.29.5. Discharge Under Other Than 10 U.S.C. Chapter 61. Add "(EPTS)," "(Excess Leave),"
   or "(Not Proximate Result)," to more fully explain this disposition action.
   3.29.6. Discharge Under 10 U.S.C. 1207. Use only when the member is unfit and the disability
   is due to intentional misconduct, willful neglect, or was incurred during a period of unauthorized
   absence.
   3.29.7. Removal From TDRL (Fit). Use only for TDRL members found fit and being removed
   from the TDRL.
   3.29.8. Retain on TDRL. Use only for unfit TDRL members retained on that list.
   3.29.9. Revert With Disability Benefits: Except as shown below, use this recommended
   disposition for an unfit retired member serving on AD who is reverting to the retired list with
   disability benefits. Under this category, add "Temporary Retirement" or "Permanent Retirement,"
   as applicable, in item 12 of AF Form 356. Example: "Revert with Disability Benefits (Temporary
   Retirement)." EXCEPTION: To receive disability benefits, unfit members previously retired
   for years of service or age must have a disability of 30 percent or more (10 U.S.C. 1402 (b) and
   1402(a)). Otherwise, the member reverts to the retired list without disability benefits.
   3.29.10. Revert Without Disability Benefits. Use only for a retired member serving on AD who
   is reverting to the retired list without disability benefits.
3.30. PEB Summary Statement. The PEB recommends action based on objective findings of
record, and uses the "Remarks" section of AF Form 356 to briefly summarize the rationale for its
decision. The PEB may express matters of opinion, so long as they clearly identify them as such.
Generally, the PEB will make statements concerning the following:
   3.30.1. Personal impressions created by the appearance of the member if such impressions are at
   variance with documentary evidence in the case file.
   3.30.2. The percentage rating or recommended disposition varies from that which would appear
   appropriate.
   3.30.3. The member is unfit (excluding EPTS) and scheduled for nondisability retirement within
   the 12-month period immediately after the MEB evaluation.
   3.30.4. The member is unfit because of defects or conditions known before the evaluation or
   identified during the last periodic physical examination but not previously found disqualifying or
   unfitting for continued active duty.
   3.30.5. One of the member's defects or conditions was the direct result of a combat-related
   injury, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 104, and that defect, standing alone, makes the member unfit.
   3.30.6. Determination that one of the member's defects or conditions was the direct result of
   armed conflict or caused by an instrumentality of war during a period of war, and that defect or
   condition, standing alone, makes the member unfit.
   3.30.7. Disagreement with a LOD finding under AFI 36-2910.
22                                                              AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006


     3.30.8. (If condition was incurred on or before 23 September l996) - Determination that
     the disability of an ARC member on AD 30 days or less is not the proximate result of performing
     AD or inactive duty training (excluding EPTS).
     3.30.9. (If condition was incurred after 23 September l996) - Determination that the
     disability of an ARC member on AD 30 days or less is not in line of duty (excluding EPTS).
3.31. Dissenting Report. Any voting member of a PEB may prepare a signed report for any case
in which he or she disagrees with the majority decision. Include in the report the reasons for the
disagreement; and identify those matters that are personal opinions. Show in the report the type of
hearing, the date, and location of the PEB. Attach a copy to each set of the PEB findings and give to
the member before asking him or her to agree or disagree with the PEB action.
3.32. PEB Case File Assembly and Disposition. See Table 3.3 for instructions on assembling
the case, marking exhibits, and disposing of the case file. The completed case file is "For Official
Use Only," and AFIs 37-131, Air Force Freedom of Information Act Program, and 37-132 apply.

Section 3C—IPEB Procedures

3.33. IPEB Review. The IPEB reviews appropriate medical and personnel records, and related
documentation to determine fitness for duty. Neither the member nor counsel may be present at the
informal hearing.
3.34. IPEB Findings. AFPC/DPSD sends AF Form 356, along with an AF Form 1180, by
electronic means whenever possible to the PEBLO at the referring medical facility.
     3.34.1. Action by the PEBLO and the member. Within 1 duty day of receiving the IPEB’s
     findings, the PEBLO locates and counsels the member on the recommended disposition and
     on his or her rights, available options, and required actions. The member has 10 calendar
     days to agree or disagree with the IPEB’s findings. AFPC/DPSD may approve limited
     extensions up to 5 calendar days. The PEBLO and others in the disability system may
     answer questions, but the member alone makes the final decision and documents that
     decision by marking the appropriate block on AF Form 1180. Prior to acting on a member’s
     request for a FPEB, the PEBLO will review with the member the applicable standard detailed
     in the VASRD in order for member to understand what his symptoms would have to be to
     warrant an increase in the percentage of disability. If member disagrees with the
     recommendation of the IPEB and requests a FPEB hearing, member may submit a brief
     rebuttal stating reason for disagreement.
        3.34.1.1. Signs the counseling portion of AF Form 1180;
        3.34.1.2. Informs HQ AFPC/DPPD of the member's decision by electronic means,
        telephone, or by message if overseas (includes MINIMIZE);
        3.34.1.3. Gives the member a copy of AF Forms 1180 and 356;
        3.34.1.4. Retains a copy of each form in suspense until case completion;
        3.34.1.5. Mails or sends by electronic means the signed original AF Form 1180 and the
        rebuttal, if applicable, to HQ AFPC/DPPD.
     3.34.2. Action by HQ AFPC/DPPD. Upon notification of member's decision, HQ AFPC/DPPD
     will:
AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006                                                                     23


       3.34.2.1. Continue processing the case as appropriate if the member agrees with the IPEB
       findings.
       3.34.2.2. Request a formal hearing for any member who disagrees with an unfit finding
       and forward the case file to the FPEB.
       3.34.2.3. If member disagrees with a fit finding, a rebuttal statement must accompany the
       AF Form 1180 and the Chief, USAF Physical Disability Division, will determine whether
       there is sufficient justification for a Formal Board hearing.
           3.34.2.3.1. If insufficient justification, member’s request for an FPEB will be denied
           and the PEBLO will be notified. The PEBLO will notify the member and the
           Military Personnel Section (MPS) that the member has been returned to duty. The
           MPS will be required to accomplish appropriate personnel actions as outlined in this
           instruction (Chapter 4)
           3.34.2.3.2. If sufficient justification exists, member will be scheduled for a Formal
           Board hearing.
3.35. NEXT OF KIN (NOK) Counseling. If the member is unable to act on his own behalf
because of mental incompetence, is comatose, or it would be dangerous to his or her health, the
PEBLO personally counsels the NOK. The NOK signs AF Form 1180 for the member.
   3.35.1. When the NOK is not near the referring facility, HQ AFPC/DPPD sends AF Forms 1180
   and 356 and other information to another Physical Evaluation Board Referral Hospital (PEBRH)
   near the NOK, where the PEBLO will counsel the NOK and complete the required actions. If the
   NOK is not near a PEBRH, HQ AFPC/DPPD sends the necessary forms to the NOK, with a
   letter of explanation, and requests a reply within a specified time (normally 2 weeks).
   3.35.2. If the PEBLO cannot identify or locate the NOK, the PEBLO informs HQ AFPC/DPPD,
   who then refers the case to the FPEB.
   3.35.3. When the IPEB recommends permanent or temporary retirement with maximum benefits
   (100 percent compensable rating), and time and circumstances do not permit a formal hearing,
   HQ AFPC/ DPPD processes the case for Secretarial determination without the member's or
   NOK's agreement. HQ AFPC/DPPD includes a statement of the circumstances in the case file.
3.36. IPEB Fit Findings. The IPEB will stamp the AF Form 618 "Fit - Return to Duty." The
stamp will be signed and dated by the IPEB president or board member. (The IPEB will not initially
issue an AF Form 356.)
   3.36.1. A designated assistant to the Director, SAFPC will review the case. If approved, the
   assistant will sign and date in the space provided on the stamped AF Form 618, which is then
   filed in the member's out-patient health record.
   3.36.2. Approval by the SAFPC designated assistant completes the disability evaluation process.
   However, before the records are returned to the PEBLO, HQ AFPC/DPAMM will review them
   and, if applicable, include a memorandum advising that the member will require an assignment
   limitation code (ALC) "C." For ARC members not on extended active duty, the records will be
   returned to the appropriate ARC headquarters for review and action.
   3.36.3. Upon receiving the records, the PEBLO will take the following actions:
       3.36.3.1. Notify the member of actions taken in the case.
24                                                               AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006


        3.36.3.2. Notify the Military Personnel Flight (MPF) that the member has been returned to
        duty, and ask them to accomplish the required personnel actions in this instruction (Chapter
        4).
        3.36.3.3. Gives the MPF a copy of HQ AFPC/DPAMM's memorandum containing Code
        "C" instructions, if applicable.
3.37. Special Review by the IPEB.
     3.37.1. When a hospital commander discovers any of the circumstances listed below, he or she
     sends a report of circumstances (with supporting evidence) and requests special review by the
     IPEB. If the request meets the criteria for special review, HQ AFPC/DPPD refers the case to the
     IPEB. The special review may be conducted by the same members who previously considered
     the case, or different members if one or more of the original board members are unavailable. If,
     after review, the IPEB revises its findings, it prepares a new AF Form 356 and reprocesses the
     case. If there is no change, HQ AFPC/DPPD notifies the hospital commander to continue
     processing the original case and adjusts the time limit for response. The following circumstances
     may merit a special review:
        3.37.1.1. Pertinent medical records or evidence were not sent to the informal PEB.
        3.37.1.2. A change in diagnosis that does not require another medical workup or new
        medical board. (If the change is major, see recall guidelines, paragraph 2.6)
        3.37.1.3. Changes in medical status that may change the IPEB's findings and recommended
        disposition.
     3.37.2. If after the IPEB has found a member fit, the hospital commander discovers additional
     facts or evidence which might meet the criteria for special review by the IPEB, and HQ
     AFPC/DPPD agrees, HQ AFPC/DPPD will reopen the case. In addition to the report of
     circumstances and supporting evidence, the PEBLO returns the member's records to HQ
     AFPC/DPPD.
        3.37.2.1. If, upon special review, the IPEB issues an unfit finding and recommends
        disability separation or retirement, an AF Form 356 will be referred to the evaluee, and the
        case will proceed in the same manner as other unfit cases.
        3.37.2.2. If the IPEB does not change its initial fit finding, they will issue an AF Form 356
        and forward it, with the rest of the case file, directly to SAFPC for review.
        3.37.2.3. If the SAFPC agrees with the IPEB's fit finding, they will issue a memorandum
        directing the member's return to duty and return the case file to HQ AFPC/DPPD. The MEB,
        AF Form 356, and SAFPC memorandum will be placed in the member's out-patient health
        record.
        3.37.2.4. If the SAFPC finds the member unfit, they will issue "revised recommended
        findings" (RRF) and the case proceeds in the same manner as other unfit cases.
     3.37.3. When appropriate, the PEBLO keeps the MPF apprised of the status of any case
     undergoing special review.
AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006                                                                         25


Section 3D—FPEB Procedures

3.38. Purpose of the Formal Hearing. Gives members recommended for discharge or retirement
the opportunity to appear in person before the FPEB, to be represented by an appointed military
counsel or counsel of their choice, and to present evidence and call witnesses. Hearings are not
adversarial; they are administrative in nature.
3.39. Situations That Require a Formal Hearing.
       3.39.1. When it is requested by the member after the IPEB has issued an unfit finding.
       3.39.2. When the IPEB issues an unfit finding and the member neither agrees nor disagrees
       with the findings, or submits a conditional concurrence.
       3.39.3. When the member is unable to act in his or her own behalf and the NOK is unknown,
       unavailable, or is unwilling to accept the responsibility.
       3.39.4. When the Chief, HQ AFPC/DPPD, or other final reviewing authority decides that a
       formal hearing is in the best interest of the member and the Air Force. In these cases, the
       official concerned directs the hearing in writing. The hearing may be held in absentia if the
       evaluee is a TDRL member (see paragraph 7.19).
3.40. PEBLO Actions. Prior to the formal hearing the PEBLO:
       3.40.1. Issues orders placing member on temporary duty (TDY) to 59 Med Wg (WHMC),
       Lackland AFB TX 78236-5300, when the member needs military or commercial
       transportation to the formal board. Shows on the order that the TDY is for the specific
       purpose of appearing before the FPEB and includes the reporting date and time. Ensures the
       member arrives at Lackland no more than 24 hours before the scheduled reporting time. The
       reporting time is when the member is to consult with the appointed military legal counsel and
       review the case records. The actual hearing takes place after the consultation. If traveling by
       aeromedical evacuation, shows on the orders that member will travel "Class 4," unless that
       class is not appropriate due to medical reasons. The referring medical facility funds TDY to
       the FPEB (For ARC members, refer to paragraph 8.12). Members normally may not take
       leave in conjunction with TDY to the FPEB (Chapter 4).
       3.40.2. Gives the member up-to-date information on Lackland AFB housing, transportation,
       meals, location of buildings, where to report, how to contact appointed military counsel, and
       how to get orders indorsed for reimbursement.
       3.40.3. Tells the member that active duty and ARC members must wear the service uniform
       unless they can not wear it for medical reasons. Wear of the military uniform must conform
       with all requirements of AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force
       Personnel.
3.41. HQ AFPC/DPPDF Actions. Prior to the hearing HQ AFPC/DPPDF:
       3.41.1. Allows the member up to 3 duty days after arrival at the FPEB to review the
       available records and prepare the case. If the member needs more time, he or she submits a
       written request to the FPEB president. The member should state the reasons for the requested
       delay and how much extra time he or she needs. If disapproved, a written notice explains the
       reason for the disapproval, or if approved, gives a new date and time for the formal hearing.
       3.41.2. Informs the member, counsel, and witnesses of the rules outlined in this section.
26                                                               AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006


       3.41.3. Ensures that member and counsel have access to this instruction, AFPD 36-32,
       DoDD 1332.18, DoDI's 1332.38 and 13332.39, AFI 48-123, the VASRD, and any other
       directives or publications referred to in this instruction that may apply.
3.42. Failure of Member To Appear for a Formal Hearing. With the exception of members
who are mentally incompetent, absentia cases, TDRL cases, or when appearance would be harmful to
the member's medical condition, if a member fails to appear for a scheduled formal hearing, the
FPEB delays the hearing and investigates the absence. The FPEB President decides whether to
reschedule the hearing or proceed with it. Include a statement of circumstances in the record. The
appointed military counsel must be present at the hearing if neither the member nor another counsel
representing the member is present. EXCEPTION: Return to DPPDS cases on TDRL members
found fit and recommended for removal from TDRL (see paragraph 7.25.2).
3.43. Excusal from Hearing. A member may request to be excused from personally appearing at
a hearing. This request is not to be confused with the waiver of formal hearing (paragraph 3.44). The
request to be excused may be made either before or after the member travels to the hearing. The
FPEB president at his discretion may approve a member's request for excusal. The record of the
hearing must clearly show that this was a voluntary act by the member. In such cases, the designated
legal counsel represents the member during all open sessions. The member remains in the area until
the FPEB completes its action. Excusal does not keep the FPEB from referring the member to 59
Med Wg (WHMC) for medical consultation is needed.
3.44. Waiver of Formal Hearing. Formal hearings are either requested by a member or directed
by competent authority. After a hearing has been scheduled as the result of a member’s request or
direction by competent authority, a member must appear unless a waiver has been requested and
approved. A member may request a waiver either before or after arrival at the FPEB. The waiver
must include the reasons for the request and indicate concurrence with the IPEB's findings. The
FPEB president is the approval authority for waivers, except for directed formal hearings, in which
case the directing official is the approval authority. The member also signs a statement of
understanding acknowledging no further right to demand a formal hearing without substantial new
evidence or unless a subsequent review level changes the findings and recommended disposition of
the IPEB. The request for waiver becomes a permanent part of the record.
       3.44.1. If the member has arrived at Lackland AFB, the FPEB president may approve such
       waivers if in the best interest of all concerned. This authority applies only to formal hearings
       scheduled at the request of the member. Only the directing official may waive directed
       formal hearings.
3.45. Representation by Counsel. Members have legal representation at the formal hearing,
unless they decline in writing. The representative is a PEB-appointed military counsel (a judge
advocate), another military counsel of the member's choice, if reasonably available to perform such
duties, or civilian counsel of the member's choice, at member's expense. When the member
designates other military or civilian counsel, they assume the responsibilities and duties outlined in
this chapter for the FPEB military counsel. The designated counsel or member may ask the regularly
appointed military counsel to assist in pre-hearing preparation. The FPEB president or the regularly
appointed military counsel explains formal hearing procedures to the designated counsel before the
PEB convenes.
3.46. Appointed Counsel. The FPEB appoints military counsel to safeguard the legal rights of the
member and present his or her case to the board. Appointed counsel attends all open hearing
sessions, unless excused in writing by the member. Duties and responsibilities include:

       3.46.1. Advising member of rights, options, and formal hearing rules.
       3.46.2. Preparing or assisting member in case presentation.
       3.46.3. Obtaining sworn statements or other evidence in support of the member's position. If
       presenting additional medical evidence, label it as "additional medical evidence" rather than
       as an "addendum" to prior medical records.
       3.46.4. Examining and cross-examining witnesses, as appropriate.
       3.46.5. Submitting oral or written arguments, as appropriate.
       3.46.6. Counseling the member on the PEB's findings and recommended disposition.
       3.46.7. Preparing or assisting the member in preparing the rebuttal, when requested.
3.47. Special Cases. When a member is mentally incompetent or the physician determines that
knowledge of the condition would harm the member, the appointed legal counsel represents the
member if the NOK (or guardian) fails to reply or designate alternate counsel. Include a statement of
the circumstances in the record. The appointed military counsel must be present at the hearing if
neither the NOK, guardian, nor another designated counsel is present.
3.48. Formal Hearing Instructions. HQ AFPC/DPPD will establish and provide to HQ
AFPC/DPPDF the formal hearing format and procedures.
3.49. Actions Following Formal Hearing. HQ AFPC/DPPDF prepares AF Forms 356 and 1180,
files the originals in the member's master case file, and gives copies to the referring MTF, HQ
AFPC/DPPD, the member, and the counsel.
       3.49.1. Time Limits. After receiving AF Form 356, Findings and Recommended
       Disposition of USAF Physical Evaluation Board, and AF IMT 1180, Action on
       Physical Evaluation Board Findings and Recommended Disposition , the evaluee has 1
       duty day to either agree or disagree with the FPEB findings. If the evaluee disagrees, he or
       she may submit a written rebuttal within 10 calendar days. The FPEB president may approve
       written requests for additional time to allow the member to obtain additional medical
       documentation or consult with legal counsel.
       3.49.2. Contents of Rebuttal:
           3.49.2.1. Specific items with which the evaluee disagrees.
           3.49.2.2. The reasons for the disagreement.
           3.49.2.3. The desired outcome, including disposition and percentage of disability if
           applicable.
           3.49.2.4. Supporting statements or documents. Do not resubmit as part of the rebuttal
           documents entered as evidence during the formal hearing.
       3.49.3. Counseling the Evaluee After the Formal Hearing. The appointed military counsel,
       PEBLO, or other counsel will counsel the evaluee in person using counseling guidance at
       Attachment 2. If the member is not at Lackland AFB, but is at or near another PEBRH, HQ
       AFPC/DPPDF asks the PEBLO there to counsel the member. After the counseling, the PEB
       counsel or PEBLO signs the AF Form 1180 and helps the member complete his or her part.
           3.49.3.1. If the member disagrees with the findings, the counsel or PEBLO may help the
           member prepare the rebuttal or, at the member's request, the counsel submits the rebuttal
28                                                           AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006


        for the member. The PEBLO keeps one copy of AF Form 1180, gives the member a
        copy, and sends the original to HQ AFPC/DPPDF with the rebuttal.
        3.49.3.2. If a member is represented by other counsel, HQ AFPC/DPPDF gives AF
        Forms 356 and 1180 to the counsel and requests that person to:
            3.49.3.2.1. Counsel the member on the results of the PEB.
            3.49.3.2.2. Give the member a copy of AF Forms 356 and 1180 and the audio
            cassette (if requested), and advise the member of the available options.
            3.49.3.2.3. Return the completed forms with rebuttal, if any, on time.
        3.49.3.3. HQ AFPC/DPPDF mails AF Forms 356 and 1180 with a memorandum of
        instructions to members not near Lackland AFB or a PEBRH. Forms must be completed
        and returned by a specified date, with the rebuttal (if any). If HQ AFPC/DPPDF does not
        receive a reply by the specified date, case processing continues without a response. HQ
        AFPC/DPPDF monitors the case to ensure completion of actions on time.
        3.49.3.4. Counseling of NOK or Guardian. The designated counsel counsels the NOK
        (or guardian) in the same manner prescribed for the member. If the NOK is unknown or
        unavailable, the FPEB counsel submits a statement of circumstances and points out any
        information from the case file that is important to the final review and evaluation of the
        case.
     3.49.4. Failure or Refusal to Reply or Make an Election. When the member fails or refuses
     to make an election, fails to submit a rebuttal within the specified time limit, or submits a
     conditional concurrence, HQ AFPC/DPPDF sends a written explanation of the circumstances
     with the case file to HQ AFPC/DPPD for final review and processing.
     3.49.5. Record of Formal Hearing. AFPC/DPSDF makes an audio recording of the
     formal hearing testimony and attaches it to the case file for the benefit of subsequent
     review levels.

                                             Chapter 4

                            PERSONNEL PROCESSING ACTIONS

Section 4A—Administrative Controls

4.1. PEBLO Responsibilities. The PEBLO coordinates processing actions at base and Reserve
component levels, and is essential to the prompt, effective processing of disability evaluation
cases. The PEBLO contacts the member's commander or servicing MPF for any needed data or
documentation. The commander or servicing MPF provides the requested information as
quickly as possible so as not to delay processing.
4.2. Ordering the Member to a Medical Facility or to the FPEB. The member's commander
promptly moves the member to the proper facility to complete medical examination, treatment,
and processing.
4.3. Personnel Data. The PEBLO sends to HQ AFPC/DPPD documents required by AFI 48-
123. The MPF provides the PEBLO information required to complete AF Form 1185,
Statement of Record Data, and supplies other data and documents needed ( Table 4.1). The
PEBLO or MPF advises HQ AFPC/DPPD of any change in the member's status or in the data
shown on the AF Form 1185.
4.4. Control of Member During PEB Processing. Disability processing begins when the
PEBRH or HQ AFPC/DPAMM refers a medical board case to the PEB. Once in disability
channels, the following restrictions apply to ensure the member is available for necessary
disability processing actions:
     4.4.1. The member may not take leave outside the local area.
     4.4.2. The member may not go on TDY.
     4.4.3. The MPF will not reassign the member, except for emergency reasons, until receiving
     notification of the final determination.
     4.4.4. The PEBLO notifies the member's commander and servicing MPF, in writing, when
     the MTF or HQ AFPC/DPAMM refers a case to the PEB, and informs them of the preceding
     restrictions.
     4.4.5. Exceptions to the restrictions on TDY and reassignment are those actions necessary
     for completion of disability processing, i.e., TDY to the FPEB and TDY or permanent
     change of station (PCS) in a patient status for required medical evaluation or treatment. HQ
     AFPC/DPPD authorizes exceptions to the leave restriction outside the local area when
     warranted by circumstances and when approval of leave will not adversely affect case
     processing.
     4.4.6. Essential administrative controls during disability processing are:
        4.4.6.1. Member Evaluated as Outpatient. The PEBLO asks the member's commander
        or servicing MPF to ensure the member stays available for possible additional disability
        evaluation processing.
AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006                                                                      35


       4.4.6.2. Member Evaluated as Inpatient - Not Assigned to Referring Medical Facility.
       The member remains at the referring facility unless HQ AFPC/DPPD authorizes return to
       home unit. If there is an unusual delay in completing the processing and the PEBLO, the
       member's commander, or the servicing MPF believes it to be in the best interest of all,
       contact HQ AFPC/DPPD and request authority to return the member to the unit of
       assignment. HQ AFPC/DPPD will normally approve such requests if there is no medical
       reason for the member to remain at the facility and if adequate disability counseling
       support is available at the home station.
       4.4.6.3. Member Evaluated While Assigned to Referring Medical Facility. The member
       remains at the facility. HQ AFPC/DPPD makes exceptions when appropriate or when the
       member requires transfer to a VA medical facility for further hospitalization.
4.5. Control of Member After PEB Action. The MPF must not retire, discharge, nor release a
member from active duty before receiving the final decision in the form of retirement orders or
instructions from HQ AFPC/DPPD directing disposition. Unless otherwise directed, use the
following interim administrative control measures after the PEB completes its action and the
member has agreed or submitted a rebuttal, but before the final decision:
   4.5.1. Physically Fit. When the PEB finds the member fit, the medical facility commander
   returns the member to his or her unit of assignment in a duty status. The local MTF takes
   action to confirm or revise the physical profile series according to AFI 48-123. If the case is
   under special review (paragraph 3.37), the medical facility commander advises the
   member's immediate commander or servicing MPF, in writing, that the PEB findings and
   recommended disposition are subject to revision, and restrictions in paragraph 4.4 remain in
   effect.
   4.5.2. Physically Unfit. When the PEB determines the member is unfit, he or she will
   remain under the control of the appropriate commander until final disposition of the case. As
   in fit cases, restrictions in paragraph 4.4 remain in effect. When assigned to a medical
   facility in a patient status, the member remains at the facility, unless transferred to another
   military or VA medical facility for further hospitalization. A member evaluated in an
   outpatient status or attached to the referring medical facility may return to his or her unit of
   assignment to await final disposition unless release from the facility is not possible because
   of the member's medical condition. The following restrictions or instructions apply:
       4.5.2.1. A member returned to the unit of assignment may perform military duties within
       the limitations of his or her physical condition.
       4.5.2.2. The referring MTF commander must give the member's immediate commander
       written notice of the member's medical condition and duty limitations, and the
       commander will consider these factors in assigning duties.
       4.5.2.3. The immediate commander contacts the referring medical facility or the nearest
       medical facility if any question arises as to the member's ability to perform a specific
       duty.
       4.5.2.4. If the member is rehospitalized, the referring medical facility or PEBLO
       immediately contacts HQ AFPC/DPPD giving details, and indicating whether
       reprocessing through the disability evaluation system is needed.
36                                                              AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006


Section 4B—PCS in Awaiting Orders Status

4.6. General PCS "Home" Rules. HQ AFPC/DPPD (or AFGOMO in the case of general
officer or general officer selectees) may authorize a member to go "PCS in awaiting orders
status" to await final disposition of his or her disability case. Basic trainees are not eligible for
this program.
4.7. Application Procedures. Members wishing to go PCS in awaiting orders status apply in
writing to HQ AFPC/DPPD through their MPF. General officers and general officer selectees
may apply to AFGOMO through their commander. Applicants provide the reasons for the
request and verify they meet all requirements reflected in Section 4B of this chapter. When a
member is a patient at the referring medical facility, the application is first sent through the
PEBLO at the facility. Criteria for applying:
     4.7.1. Request is for PCS from, and to, locations within continental United States (CONUS).
     Do not consider Alaska and Hawaii as part of the CONUS.
     4.7.2. Member is on extended active duty.
     4.7.3. The PEB evaluated the case, with a finding that the member is unfit and recommended
     disposition is disability retirement, discharge with or without severance pay, or discharge
     under other than chapter 61, Title 10 U.S.C.
     4.7.4. Member has either agreed with the informal PEB findings or has submitted a rebuttal
     to the formal PEB hearing.
     4.7.5. Member did not request retention in limited assignment status and did not submit a
     rebuttal requesting retention on active duty.
     4.7.6. Member is competent or incompetent and the NOK or guardian accepts responsibility.
     4.7.7. Member does not need further hospital care at a military, VA, or civilian medical
     facility.
     4.7.8. Member does not have a nondisability retirement or separation action pending.
     4.7.9. Local TMO counseled the member on movement of dependents and household goods
     and member received a copy of Attachment 3.
     4.7.10. Member knows that, while in a PCS-awaiting-orders status, he or she must return to
     unit of assignment, referring medical facility, or the PEB if directed to do so by HQ
     AFPC/DPPD, through the MPF or HQ AFGOMO, as applicable. If SAF approves the PEB's
     recommendation, the member will not have to return.
     4.7.11. Member gives the MPF a nonmilitary address and phone number to write or call, if
     needed, and advises the MPF of any changes to that address or phone number.
     4.7.12. Member acknowledges understanding that the Defense Joint Military Pay System
     (DJMS) deducts the number of days in PCS-awaiting-orders from the number of days leave
     accrued as of the date of retirement or discharge.
     4.7.13. PEBLO Actions. When attached or assigned to the referring medical facility, the
     PEBLO endorses the member's application to the MPF and indicates the member was
     counseled on the findings and recommended disposition of the PEB - 4.7.14. MPF Actions.
AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006                                                                    37


   The MPF endorses the application to HQ AFPC/DPPD and verifies that the member does not
   have a nondisability retirement or discharge pending. If AFPC approves the application, the
   MPF completes the following actions:
       4.7.13.1. Verifies whether member has an injured or ill travel or transportation
       entitlement pending. If so, does not publish special orders until the member exercises
       those entitlements.
       4.7.13.2. Publishes and distributes orders according to AFI 36-2102, Base Level
       Relocation Procedures. Ensures the member has a copy of "PCS In Awaiting Orders
       Status Instructions" ( Attachment 3). NOTE: AFGOMO will publish and distribute
       orders for general officers and general officer selectees.
       4.7.13.3. Completes all required retirement or discharge processing and counseling so
       the member won't have to return to the unit of assignment at the time of actual retirement
       or discharge.
       4.7.13.4. Refers the member to the local TMO for counseling on movement of
       dependents and household goods.
       4.7.13.5. Obtains an address and phone number where the member can be reached while
       on awaiting orders status and determines whether address is member's home of record or
       the place where ordered to AD.
       4.7.13.6. Notifies HQ AFPC/DPPD if the member does not go PCS in awaiting orders
       status or if there is any change in the nonmilitary address or phone number.
4.8. Action by Reviewing Officials. HQ AFPC/DPPD reviews each request for PCS in
awaiting orders status and advises the member, through the MPF, when approved or
disapproved. The approval notification will include the member's service and entitlements to
travel to any designated place in the CONUS, or specify restriction as outlined in paragraph 4.9
AFGOMO will review requests from general officers or general officer selectees and advise
them when approved or disapproved. AFGOMO also notifies HQ AFPC/DPPD of the decision.
4.9. Travel. A member may PCS to any designated place in the CONUS if he or she has
completed 8 years continuous active duty with no single break of more than 90 days just before
PEB evaluation. If the member does not have 8 years continuous active service, he or she may
go PCS only to the home of record or the place where ordered to active duty. Travel to the
nonmilitary address must meet the rules set forth in the Joint Federal Travel Regulation (JFTR),
Volume 1.

Section 4C—-Disability Retirement or Discharge Processing by the Servicing MPF

4.10. MPF Counseling and Processing. The MPF counsels and processes the member after
receiving final disposition. Contact other MPFs or PEBLOs to complete the required actions if
the member is not available for face-to-face counseling or processing. Counsel the member by
mail if there are no other means of contact. The MPF must advise HQ AFPC/DPPD when there
is an unusual delay or problem in completing the required counseling or processing.
       4.10.1. Member Unable To Act in Own Behalf. When the member is incompetent, or
       unable to act in his or her own behalf, contact and counsel the NOK, preferably in person.
       The MPF gets the NOK's signature on applicable forms and documents or includes a
38                                                             AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006


       statement indicating the reason why member (or NOK) could not sign. If necessary,
       contact another MPF near the NOK and request help in counseling and processing.
       4.10.2. Other Action Pending. When actions, such as nondisability retirement or
       discharge and medical hold are pending, the MPF advises the appropriate AFPC office of
       the retirement or discharge by reason of physical disability and ensures conflicting
       orders, such as nondisability separation or retirement orders, are revoked.
4.11. Retirement or Discharge Date. HQ AFPC/DPPD sets the scheduled retirement or
discharge date. If the MPF can not complete the necessary processing, they must notify HQ
AFPC/DPPD before the effective date, explain why they can not complete the processing, and
provide compelling justification to support an extension. Extensions for the convenience of the
MPF or the member cannot be approved.
4.12. Discharge Orders. After receiving disposition instructions, the MPF publishes orders to
discharge the member on the scheduled date. Prepare orders on AF Form 100, Request and
Authorization for Separation, according to provisions in AFI 36-2102. When necessary,
include a statement in the orders concerning termination of appointments. The MPF sends a
copy of the orders to HQ AFPC/DPPD (Table 4.2.).
4.13. Ceremonies and Presentations of Appropriate Certificates. Commanders will conduct
a suitable ceremony before members retire or separate for disability. For an oversea member
returning to the CONUS, hold the ceremony at the oversea base. If the oversea separation base
does not do this, the MPF at the CONUS separation base arranges an appropriate ceremony
before the member leaves that base. Present the retirement or discharge certificate, along with
any awards and letters of appreciation at the ceremony. Follow these guidelines:
       4.13.1. Retirement. Commanders use AFI 36-3203, Service Retirement, as used for
       members who retire for age or service. When possible, the MPF gets a written statement
       from members who decline a ceremony.
       4.13.2. Discharge. As outlined in AFI 36-3202, Separation Documents, the member's
       immediate commander will make suitable expression of appreciation on behalf of the Air
       Force for the member's service.
       4.13.3. Exceptions. When members can not act for themselves and are in a patient
       status, or are in a VA hospital, present or mail (with suitable cover letter) the certificate
       and other documents to the NOK.
4.14. Retirement or Discharge Documents. Order-Physically Unfit. The MPF prepares
necessary documents according to Attachment 4 and enters required data into the PDS and the
DJMS to complete the retirement or discharge ( Table 4.2.). The MPF gives the member the
documents, other than the retirement or discharge certificate, before completing final retirement
or discharge processing, except when the member:
       4.14.1. Is not present on the last day of AD for any reason, such as PCS in awaiting
       orders status, on leave, or transfer to a VA hospital. Prepare and mail all required
       documents to the member on the effective date of retirement or discharge.
       4.14.2. Is incompetent or unable to act in own behalf for other reasons. Present or mail
       the required documents to the NOK (or guardian) on the effective date of retirement or
       discharge.
AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006                                                                   39


       4.14.3. Is returning to CONUS from overseas. CONUS MPF presents the required
       documents to the member during final out processing.
       4.14.4. Is being placed on the TDRL. MPF prepares and delivers retirement documents
       the same as for members being permanently retired. Special provisions for DD Form 363
       and AF Form 1344JA97 are in Attachment 4. When removing the member from the
       TDRL, HQ AFPC/DPPD prepares and mails the required orders, forms, and other
       documents.
4.15. Permissive Temporary Duty (PTDY).
       4.15.1. Commanders may grant PTDY to members retiring for disability and members
       separating for disability who are eligible for benefits under the Transition Assistance
       Management Program (TAMP) for the purpose of aiding job and house search in
       connection with transition to civilian life (20 days PTDY to members assigned to
       CONUS; 30 days to members assigned overseas).
       4.15.2. AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program and 36-3203, Service Retirement, contain
       specific guidance; however, not all PTDY procedures will apply to disability retirements
       and separations. For example, members can not take PTDY in increments because they
       won't know the disposition of their case until approved by SAF. HQ AFPC/DPPD will
       resolve any questions on PTDY for members separating or retiring for disability.
       4.15.3. Once approved, DoD imposes strict time limits in establishing separation or
       retirement dates (see Chapter 5). Generally, members must take PTDY in conjunction
       with the 20 and 30-day processing times and, when applicable, unused leave days they
       can not sell back to the government.
       4.15.4. Hospitalized or incompetent members are not eligible for PTDY since they are
       unable to perform the mission of PTDY (job and house search).
4.16. Place of Retirement or Discharge. Members being retired or discharged for disability
may, under certain circumstances, choose the place where final retirement or discharge action
takes place. This choice may limit future entitlement to movement of the member as well as
dependents and household goods. In order to prevent the possible loss of entitlements, the MPF
makes members aware of the requirements outlined in AFIs 36-3202, 36-3203, 36-2102, AFR
76-8, Revenue Traffic Transported On Dept Of Defense Aircraft Other Than Airlift Service,
Industrial Fund, Operational Policies, as well as JFTR and this instruction before they retire,
separate, or make any moves. Provide copies of applicable entitlement information sheet found
in AFIs 36-3202 or 36-3203 to members separating or retiring from an oversea duty location.
The place of retirement or discharge is as follows:
       4.16.1. Member Serving in CONUS. Retire or discharge member at the unit of
       assignment. (Alaska and Hawaii are outside the CONUS.)
          4.16.1.1. If the member is in a military or VA medical facility or is in PCS in
          awaiting orders status, show the member's actual location at the time of retirement or
          separation on the orders.
          4.16.1.2. If the duty base can not process the retirement or discharge, send the
          member TDY to the nearest Air Force base that has the processing capability.
40                                                            AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006


       4.16.2. Member Serving Outside CONUS. The member may select retirement or
       separation at the oversea duty location or a separation processing base of choice in the
       CONUS.
          4.16.2.1. Additional options may be available for members taking at least 5 days
          leave or PTDY in conjunction with separation or retirement. Specific guidance
          concerning the various options is in AFIs 36-3203 and 36-3202.
          4.16.2.2. The PEBLO advises HQ AFPC/DPPD of the member's desires.
          4.16.2.3. If the member is not retiring or separating overseas, the MPF publishes PCS
          without Permanent Change of Assignment (PCA) orders. If applicable, include
          authorization for movement of dependents and household goods in the orders.
       4.16.3. US Territorial Residents. A member whose home of record or place from which
       ordered to AD is a US territory may qualify as a resident of that area. If member is not
       serving in that US territorial location, he or she may return to the home of record or place
       from which ordered to AD for retirement or discharge at the discretion of HQ
       AFPC/DPPD.
          4.16.3.1. HQ AFPC/DPPD will approve such movement only if authorized
          retirement or discharge facilities are available in the overseas area (AFIs 36-3202
          and 36-2110, Assignments) and there is available transportation to ensure the member
          arrives at the home location before the scheduled date of retirement or discharge.
          4.16.3.2. The MPF tells the member that travel to his or her home location will use
          home of selection entitlements.
          4.16.3.3. If HQ AFPC/DPPD disapproves movement to the oversea home location,
          retire or discharge the member at the base of assignment, or another suitable location
          as directed by HQ AFPC/DPPD.
          4.16.3.4. If needed, move the member to a VA medical facility in the CONUS
          pending movement overseas. When bed space becomes available, the VA will move
          the member to the oversea medical facility.
       4.16.4. General Officers. Unless otherwise directed by the AFGOMO, this section also
       applies to general officers retiring by reason of physical disability.
4.17. Movement and Orders for Members Assigned Overseas. When directing disability
retirement for members overseas, HQ AFPC/DPPD will show the oversea MPF on the retirement
order. The oversea MPF publishes PCS without PCA orders if the member desires to return to
the CONUS, gives the member 25 copies of the retirement order, and distributes other copies as
follows:
       4.17.1. Retiring at Non-CONUS Base. Send 5 copies to the local accounting and finance
       office. The MPF retains sufficient copies for such things as the unit personnel records
       group and relocation folder.
       4.17.2. Retiring in CONUS. When the member will return for retirement, the oversea
       MPF sends copies of the orders to the designated CONUS MPF with an advance notice
       of the member's arrival date and a copy of the PCS without PCA orders. These orders
       will direct the member to report to the designated CONUS MPF early enough to
AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006                                                                       41

          retirement or date terminal leave is to start. If applicable, include authorization for
          movement of dependents and household goods in the orders.

     5.6.3. DELETED.
5.7. Changes to PEB Findings. The AFPB may change the findings and recommended
disposition of the PEB. When this happens, the AFPB documents and describes the basis for the
change. Based on the application of accepted medical principles, the AFPB identifies the principles
at issue, and relates the issue to the facts and circumstances established in the record of the
proceedings of the PEB. The AFPB recommends the final disposition to SAFPC under the criteria in
paragraph 5.9
     5.7.1. DELETED.
     5.7.2. DELETED.

        5.7.3.3. DELETED.
5.8. Personal Appearance. Neither the member, NOK, nor counsel may appear before the AFPB,
except at the specific invitation of AFPC. The board reviews all the records evaluated by the PEB(s),
records of the PEB(s) hearings, plus any rebuttal or additional documents submitted by the member
or requested by SAFPC.
5.9. SAFPC Action. SAFPC may take one of the following actions in each disability case:
     5.9.1. Defer final determination until receipt of additional records or reports deemed essential to
     final evaluation and disposition of the case.
     5.9.2. Return the case with specific directions on what actions they require before HQ
     AFPC/DPPD resubmits the case to SAFPC. (For example, further medical evaluation to secure
     additional information concerning fitness for duty or duty status.)
AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006                                                                          49


   5.9.3. Direct administrative discharge under some other applicable directive or provision of law
   when SAFPC determines such action is more appropriate than disability retirement or discharge
   under this instruction.
   5.9.4. Direct some other disposition of the case, if not specifically prohibited by law.
   5.9.5. Assign one of the following dispositions according to Title 10 U.S.C., chapter 61:
       5.9.5.1. Return to Duty. Member is physically fit for continued military service.
       5.9.5.2. Permanent Retirement. Member is physically unfit, meets criteria for retirement,
       and condition is of a permanent nature and stable (10 U.S.C. 1201 or 1204).
       5.9.5.3. Temporary Retirement. Member is physically unfit, meets criteria for retirement,
       and condition may be of a permanent nature but is not stable (10 U.S.C. 1202 or 1205).
       5.9.5.4. Discharge With Severance Pay. Member is physically unfit but does not meet the
       requirements for disability retirement (10 U.S.C. 1203 or 1206).
       5.9.5.5. Discharge Under Other Than 10 U.S.C., chapter 61. Member is physically unfit, but
       is not entitled to disability benefits provided under 10 U.S.C., chapter 61. Discharge
       members under this provision whose unfitting conditions existed prior to service, or who
       incurred unfitting conditions while in excess leave status, or while on TDRL (and the
       condition for which originally placed on the TDRL is no longer unfitting).
       5.9.5.6. Discharge Under 10 U.S.C. 1207. Member is physically unfit but is not entitled to
       disability benefits because disability resulted from the member's own intentional misconduct
       or willful neglect, or the member incurred the disability during a period of unauthorized
       absence.
       5.9.5.7. Removal From TDRL (Fit). TDRL member is physically fit; remove from the
       TDRL under 10 U.S.C. 1210(f)(1). If otherwise eligible, member has option to return to duty
       under 10 U.S.C. 1211.
       5.9.5.8. Retain on TDRL. Member is physically unfit and remains qualified for retirement
       but condition has not stabilized; retain on the TDRL.
       5.9.5.9. Revert With Disability Benefits (Temporary Retirement) or (Permanent
       Retirement). Use this disposition for an unfit retired member serving on active duty who is
       reverting to the retired list with disability benefits.
       5.9.5.10. Revert Without Disability Benefits. Use only for a retired member serving on AD
       who is reverting to the retired list without disability benefits.

Section 5B—DoD Review and Approval

5.10. Legal Basis. Public law and DoD policy require DoD review and (or) approval in certain
disability cases.
   5.10.1. Approval. In cases where the general officer or medical corps officer was processing for
   retirement by reason of age or length of service before an MEB referred his or her case for
   disability processing, the Secretary of Defense must approve the unfitness determination before
   the Service Secretary may retire or discharge the officer for disability. This requirement is in 10
   U.S.C. 1216(d) and pertains to all military services. In all other cases, SAF retains final approval
   authority.
50                                                               AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006


5.11. Routing Cases To and From DoD. HQ AFPC/DPPD sends cases to SAFPC that may
require DoD approval. If SAFPC finds the officer "unfit" and recommends retirement or discharge by
reason of physical disability, SAFPC will refer the case to DoD for review and, if applicable,
approval. After DoD action, SAFPC returns the case to HQ AFPC/DPPD for necessary
administrative action to carry out the directed disposition.

Section 5C—Final Disposition Processing

5.12. Options. Members whose final disposition of their disability case is separation (active duty
or TDRL) or TDRL from active duty, and they have 15 to 20 years active service, will be referred to
HQ AFPC/DPPR. Members who meet basic eligibility requirements for Temporary Early Retirement
Authority (TERA) may apply and, if approved, be retired under TERA. ARC members found unfit
for nonduty related medical conditions, if otherwise eligible, may apply for early retirement pursuant
to 10 U.S.C. 12732.
5.13. Service Computation. 10 U.S.C. 1208 outlines creditable service for disability retirement or
discharge. HQ AFPC/DPPD verifies and includes the amount of creditable service in the disability
retirement order or discharge disposition instructions. For ARC members, HQ AFPC/DPPD obtains
a statement of service credit from HQ ARPC.
5.14. Pay Computation. DFAS-CL is responsible for final retired pay computation and for
establishing retired pay accounts. They base computations on information in the special orders and
data entered into the DJMS by the servicing MPF at time of retirement or discharge. (See
Attachment 2 and AFMAN 36-2622, Volume 5, Personnel Concept III (Civilian), End Users
Manual for additional information.) The local finance office computes disability severance pay for
active duty members, and DFAS-Denver Center for ARC members. See Attachment 2 and Table
5.1 and Table 5.2
     5.14.1. Disability Retired Pay. DFAS-CL/FR may use two different formulas for computing
     retired pay (Table 5.1). They may base computation on years of creditable service or on
     percentage of disability, whichever is more advantageous to the member. In addition, if entitled
     to pay computation under some other provision of law that would result in greater retired pay,
     DFAS-CL/FR makes that computation. DFAS-CL/FR selects the one more favorable, unless the
     member specifically requests that retired pay be computed at some lower rate authorized by law.
     According to 10 U.S.C. 1401 and 8991, retired pay may not exceed 75 percent of the retired pay
     base (current base pay or "high three," as applicable).
     5.14.2. Increased Retired Pay for Extraordinary Heroism. Enlisted members retiring for
     disability who are otherwise eligible to retire for years of service and entitled to a 10 percent
     increase in pay for certified acts of extraordinary heroism are entitled to an additional
     computation under the service retirement if they meet the requirements set forth in AFI 36-3203.
     For a member to be considered, the PEBLO or the member must make a notation on the AF
     Form 1185 "Remarks" section and attach copies of supporting documents to the AF Form 1185
     when sending it to HQ AFPC/DPPD. HQ AFPC/ DPPD accepts late submissions, provided the
     member qualifies under AFI 36-3203. SAFPC approves these actions but retired pay, including
     the heroism additive, cannot exceed the 75 percent statutory limit.
     5.14.3. Recomputation of Retired Pay for Later AD. DFAS-CL/FR recomputes disability retired
     pay to reflect active duty performed after retirement, if the member meets all the requirements
     outlined in 10 U.S.C. 1402.
AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006                                                                        51


5.15. Grade on Retirement. Unless entitled to a higher retired grade under some other provision
of law, members permanently retired for disability or placed on the TDRL retire in the highest of the
following grades (10 U.S.C. 1372):
   5.15.1. Grade in Which Serving. The grade in which the member is serving on the date placed
   on the TDRL or on the date permanently retired for disability.
   5.15.2. Higher Reserve Grade. The Reserve grade the member held at time of retirement if it is
   higher than the grade in which serving on active duty. The Reserve grade must be a valid
   USAFR or ANG grade that is still in effect at the time of retirement.
   5.15.3. Higher Grade. A higher grade in which the member served satisfactorily on active duty,
   as determined by the SAF (see Table 4.1, line 5). Service in a higher grade is usually
   satisfactory unless the higher grade was terminated for cause (except in cases where the member
   received an honorable discharge in that higher grade during a previous period of service and had
   held the grade for a period of 6 months or more); information in the member's service record
   clearly supports the conclusion that the member would have been discharged or demoted for
   cause at the time he or she held the higher grade; or member served on active duty in higher
   commissioned grade for less than 6 months.
   5.15.4. Members who are retired on or after 23 Sep 96, may be retired in the regular or reserve
   grade to which they had been selected and would have been promoted, had it not been for the
   physical disability for which they were retired. (10 U.S.C. 1372 was amended effective 23 Sep
   96.)
5.16. Grade on Discharge. The discharge grade will be the higher of the following:
   5.16.1. Grade in Which Serving. The grade in which the member is serving at the time of
   discharge.
   5.16.2. Higher Grade Determined by SAF. A grade in which the member served satisfactorily
   on active duty, as determined by the SAF, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1212 (see Table 4.1, line 5).
5.17. Disposition of Officer Appointments Upon Disability Retirement or Discharge.
   5.17.1. Discharge of Officers. A discharge terminates all appointments held by the officer.
   5.17.2. Retirement of Regular Officers. Retirement does not terminate the appointment of a
   Regular officer when permanently retired or placed on the TDRL.
   5.17.3. Retirement does not terminate the appointment of an ARC officer when permanently
   retired for disability or when placed in the Retired Reserve.
5.18. Enlisted Status at Time of Retirement or Discharge. A retirement or discharge
terminates an enlisted member's status, as well as any appointment held at the time of discharge for
disability. ARC enlisted members being retired for disability are transferred to the Retired Reserve
(see AFI 36-3203 for rules on transfer or assignment). HQ AFPC/DPPD reflects the transfer action in
the retirement order.
5.19. Date of Disability Retirement or Discharge.
   5.19.1. HQ AFPC/DPPD determines the retirement or discharge date no later than 10 days from
   the date of the Secretarial determination of unfitness. Appropriate processing and permissive
   TDY time will be considered before the effective retirement date is established.
52                                                                AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006


     5.19.2. If members have not previously sold 60 days of accrued leave after 10 February 1976,
     they must sell the leave at separation or retirement. Members retiring or separating for disability
     may use accrued leave that they can not sell back. If they have sold the maximum leave
     permitted by law, HQ AFPC/DPPD will add their accrued leave to the 20-day processing time
     (30 days if overseas) to arrive at the final discharge or retirement date (see AFI 36-3003,
     paragraph 3.13.1).
     5.19.3. HQ AFPC/DPPD will establish disability separation and retirement dates as follows:
        5.19.3.1. Date of separation or retirement will be established not to exceed 90 days from
        date of Secretary of the Air Force (SAF) Memorandum approving the separation or
        retirement. For the purposes of Benefits Delivery at Discharge, the date will be
        established as a day during the last week of the month which does not extend the DOS
        beyond 90 days from SAF Memo. For example: If 90 days would place the DOS at 15
        May, the DOS will be 29 April. Any unsellable leave must be taken prior to member’s
        separation or retirement date.
        5.19.3.2. Basic Trainees will be separated within 3 duty days of SAF memorandum.
        5.19.3.3. DELETED.
     5.19.4. HQ AFPC/DPPD has authority to make the following exceptions:
        5.19.4.1. Early Discharge or Retirement. HQ AFPC/DPPD approves retirement or
        discharge dates of less than 20 days, at the request of the member or the member's
        commander, and in the best interest of all concerned--if the MPF can complete final
        processing by the designated date. The member requests early discharge or retirement in
        writing; the MPF personnel relocations element endorses the request and forwards it to HQ
        AFPC/DPPD before HQ AFPC/DPPD issues the disposition instructions or retirement order.
        5.19.4.2. Overseas. For members located outside the CONUS who elect to return to the
        CONUS for final processing, HQ AFPC/DPPD authorizes 30 calendar days processing time.
        5.19.4.3. Hardship. HQ AFPC/DPPD may approve limited extensions, normally not to
        exceed 30 days, in cases where the member is facing an unusual personal hardship over and
        above that encountered by other members being retired or discharged for disability. Submit
        requests for extension through MPF personnel relocation channels.
        5.19.4.4. Special Cases. Unless HQ AFPC/DPPD approves a later date, the date of discharge
        for basic trainees at the AFMTC is 3 duty days after the date of the Secretarial determination
        of unfitness. HQ AFPC/DPPD may designate other disability cases for retirement or
        discharge to become effective in less than 20 calendar days and will notify all concerned.
5.20. Appeal Procedures. After HQ AFPC/DPPD announces SAF's final action, if the member
believes the disposition of his or her case constitutes an error or injustice, he or she may appeal
through application to the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records (AFBCMR) under
AFI 36-2603.
AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006                                                                 53

NOTES:
       1. Use the pay rate that applies to the member on date of retirement. It may be the
       current monthly basic pay rate, average monthly retired pay base, or, if eligible and
       applicable, some other (more favorable) rate, such as the Tower amendment provision
       outlined in Attachment 2, with maximum pay being 75 percent of the base amount of
       which computed (10 U.S.C. 1401, 1401a, 8991).
       2. When placed on TDRL, retired pay will not be less than 50 percent of the monthly
       pay rate on which computing retired pay. For members who entered military service
       prior to 8 September 1980, compute according to the current monthly basic pay rate.
       For members who entered military service on or after 8 September 1980, compute from
       a monthly retired pay base (RPB). RPB is an average of the member's highest 36
       months of active duty pay. Changes that may occur as a result of reexamination will
       not affect retired pay for members still carried on TDRL.

                                 date placed on the TDRL and in the highest grade as
                                 determined by the Secretary of the Air Force
                                 (paragraph 5.15.) (see note 2).

NOTES:
       1. Count as a whole year a part of a year that is 6 months or more, and disregard a part
       of a year that is less than 6 months (10 U.S.C. 1212 and 37 Comptroller General 832).
       A member with less than 6 months' creditable service will not receive severance pay
       since the member has no years of service to use as a multiplier. The law limits
       maximum disability severance pay to 24 months' pay of the grade in which discharged
       (10 U.S.C. 1212, paragraph 5.15., and Attachment 2).
       2. Compute the member's pay based on the base pay scale in effect when placed on the
       TDRL.

                          LIMITED ASSIGNMENT STATUS (LAS)

Section 6A—Purpose and Eligibility

6.1. Basic Eligibility. Some members found physically unfit by a PEB can serve on AD in LAS
with limitations and controls over their assignments. This option is open to members on EAD who
meet the eligibility criteria and apply for LAS. Members who have some type of nondisability
retirement or separation pending are not eligible for LAS.
6.2. Procedures and Objective. The SAF may defer the final disposition of members found
physically unfit by a PEB and who request LAS.
   6.2.1. Retention in LAS depends upon the type and extent of the member's physical defect or
   condition, the amount of medical management and support needed to sustain the member on AD,
   the physical and assignment limitations required, the years of service completed, and the Air
   Force need for the particular grade and specialty.
   6.2.2. The LAS program conserves manpower by keeping needed experience and skills that the
   Air Force can economically use. It is not the intent of the LAS program to retain a member just to
   increase benefits or allow the member to complete a period of service.
   6.2.3. Members not physically fit for AD without restriction do not have a legal or vested right
   to retention in LAS, and the Air Force does not guarantee retention for any specified period of
   AD. The Air Force may retire or discharge members on LAS at any time as the result of medical
   reevaluation. A member continued on active duty in LAS is not presumed physically fit. The
   DES will determine fitness or unfitness on the evidence of record at the time of final retirement
   or discharge.
   6.2.4. Action Offices. Designated representatives within the offices of the Directorate of
   Assignments (HQ AFPC/DPA), Medical Service Office Management Division (HQ
   AFPC/DPAM), Colonel's Group (AFDPO) for cases on colonels, General Officer Matters
   (AFGOMO) for cases on general officers, and Directorate of Personnel Program Management
   (HQ AFPC/DPP) have authority to act in processing and approving requests for retention in
   LAS.
6.3. LAS Retention Criteria. The number of members retained in LAS will be held to an absolute
minimum. Action offices will use the following guidelines:
   6.3.1. From 15 to 19 Years AD. Consider members:
       6.3.1.1. If there is a need for the member's skill, experience, grade or specialty, and
       6.3.1.2. If their physical defect or condition has essentially stabilized or, based on accepted
       principles, shows either gradual improvement or slow progression. Members must be able to
       function in a normal military environment without adverse effect on their own health, or the
       health of others, and without need for an excessive amount of medical care.
   6.3.2. Airmen with over 20 years active duty service will not be considered for LAS.
6.4. Rules for Members Retained in LAS.
56                                                                AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006


     6.4.1. Periodic Medical Examinations. The MTF examines LAS members at least once a year.
     The report of examination shows the current status of the unfitting physical defects or conditions
     for which retained in LAS and the status of any additional physical defects or conditions that may
     affect duty performance.
     6.4.2. Service Commitments. Members in LAS must complete any active service commitments
     they incur unless their overall physical condition deteriorates to a point where they are no longer
     acceptable for retention in LAS.
     6.4.3. Assignment Limitation Identification. The action offices identify members in LAS in the
     PDS with an assignment limitation code (ALC).
     6.4.4. PEB Evaluation. LAS members will be evaluated by a PEB before discharge or
     retirement.
     6.4.5. Inquiries. Address inquiries concerning the disposition status of LAS cases to HQ AFPC/
     DPPD.

Section 6B—LAS Processing

6.5. Application Procedures. Eligible members request retention in LAS by submitting AF Form
1186, Retention in Limited Assignment Status. Before doing so, members must have agreed with
the PEB's recommendation. If approved for LAS, file PEB proceedings without further action. If
disapproved for LAS, the disability case will be processed. Application procedures are as follows:
     6.5.1. Preparing AF Form 1186. The PEBLO or PEB counsel prepares four copies of AF Form
     1186 and complete the "Personnel Data" portion of the form. The PEBLO or PEB counsel
     informs the member of the purpose, policy, and objective of the LAS program before the member
     signs the forms. Send copies of AF Form 1186 and AF Form 1180 to HQ AFPC/DPPD and give
     one copy to the member.
     6.5.2. Personal Statement. Members who wish to stay on AD in LAS may attach a personal
     statement to AF Form 1186 giving any information they believe important to their case. This
     statement may cite matters of record that the member wants to emphasize for review, but the
     member should not attach other documents to AF Form 1186. Members may request a delay, not
     to exceed 3 duty days, to prepare the personal statement. If not received within the 3-duty-day
     period, HQ AFPC/DPPD will process the disability case to completion.
     6.5.3. Counseling the Member. The counselor ensures the member understands the approval
     procedures, the reevaluation requirements, and the possibility of an unscheduled termination of
     LAS.
6.6. AFPC Processing. HQ AFPC/DPPD reviews the application to ensure the member meets the
general eligibility criteria in this section. If the member is not eligible, HQ AFPC/DPPD returns AF
Form 1186 to the member, through the MPF or referring medical facility, as applicable, with a cover
memorandum advising the member that the application does not meet basic eligibility requirements.
When the request meets the basic eligibility standard, process it as follows:
     6.6.1. Medical Review. HQ AFPC/DPPD sends AF Form 1186 and allied papers, including the
     PEB findings and recommended disposition and all available medical records, to HQ
     AFPC/DPAMM for review. HQ AFPC/DPAMM determines member's medical acceptability for
     LAS retention and annotates the applicable assignment limitations, if approved, or indicates
AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006                                                                        57


   disapproval and the reason for the disapproval in the medical review portion of AF Form 1186.
   After its review, HQ AFPC/DPAMM returns the case to HQ AFPC/DPPD for further action.
   6.6.2. Assignment Determinations. When HQ AFPC/ DPAMM determines that the member is
   medically acceptable for LAS retention, HQ AFPC/DPPD sends the case to HQ AFPC/DPA for
   all enlisted persons and officers below the grade of colonel, AF/DPO for all colonels, and to
   AFGOMO for all general officers. The functional area resource manager must determine if the
   Air Force can productively use the member's services within the limitations specified by HQ
   AFPC/DPAMM. The resource manager enters the decision in the personnel review portion of
   AF Form 1186 and returns the case to HQ AFPC/DPPD for further action.
      6.6.2.1. LAS Assignment Approved. The resource manager must indicate approval and note
      the correct assignment limitation code on AF Form 1186. If the member has over 19 years of
      active duty, add a statement on AF Form 1186 documenting the unique and overriding need
      for the member's services and specifying a recommended period of retention. HQ
      AFPC/DPPD is the final approval authority for members with more than 19 years of AD.
      6.6.2.2. LAS Assignment Not Approved. The resource manager indicates disapproval on
      AF Form 1186.
   6.6.3. Final Disposition of LAS Approvals. After action by HQ AFPC/DPAMM and the
   resource manager, HQ AFPC/DPPD completes administrative processing, notifies the member of
   approval, through the MPF or referring medical facility, and advises appropriate officials of the
   LAS code and assignment limitations. Retention period for LAS approvals follow these general
   rules:
      6.6.3.1. Over 19 Years of AD. HQ AFPC/DPPD determines the period of retention.
      6.6.3.2. Less than 19 years of AD. Retention is not for a specified period of time, but does
      not normally exceed 20 years of AD.
   6.6.4. LAS Disapprovals. When the member is not medically acceptable for retention in LAS or
   when the resource manager cannot justify retention, HQ AFPC/DPPD advises the member of the
   disapproval, through the MPF or referring medical facility, and resumes case processing.

Section 6C—LAS Reevaluation

6.7. LAS Reevaluation Rules. Members retained in LAS undergo periodic or annual medical
examinations as directed by HQ AFPC/DPPD.
   6.7.1. Reevaluations will consider the current status of medical limitation and the need for the
   particular grade and specialty.
   6.7.2. HQ AFPC/DPPD may direct reevaluation at any time to assist in the management of LAS
   members or to meet current personnel manning requirements.
   6.7.3. A reevaluation may consist of a general medical examination or may include an MEB and
   PEB.
   6.7.4. The commander of a member in LAS may, at any time, refer the member to a local
   medical facility for reevaluation if the member cannot satisfactorily perform duties in his or her
   grade and specialty. In such cases, proceed according to AFI 48-123 and this instruction.
58                                                                AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006


6.8. Reevaluation Procedures. HQ AFPC/DPPD advises the MPF personnel employment
element by memorandum when an LAS reevaluation is due, and directs them to schedule the LAS
member for a medical examination.
     6.8.1. MPF Action. The personnel employment element schedules the examination at the
     closest medical facility; tells the member and the member's commander of the date, place, and
     reason for the examination; and ensures the medical facility has a copy of the memorandum
     stating the reason for the examination.
     6.8.2. MTF Action. Medical facilities conduct examinations and send the completed reports to
     HQ AFPC/DPPD within 30 days of the date of the request for re-evaluation. Unless HQ
     AFPC/DPPD requires or requests an MEB, the physical examination does not have to be
     extensive. However, it must be in enough detail to allow evaluation of the member's overall
     condition--with special emphasis on the condition for which the member was first placed on
     LAS. In most cases SF 502, Medical Record - Narrative Summary, or SF 513, Medical
     Record - Consultation Sheet, is adequate.
        6.8.2.1. If the MTF can not complete the examination within the time limit, they must advise
        HQ AFPC/DPPD of the reason for the delay and give a date when they will complete and
        forward the examination report.
        6.8.2.2. When processing by MEB is directed or required, the medical facility must follow
        guidance in AFI 48-123 and this instruction.
        6.8.2.3. The medical report must include sufficient information to document the following
        items:
            6.8.2.3.1. Interim Medical History.     New developments or changes since last LAS
            evaluation.
            6.8.2.3.2. That may contribute to the member's overall physical disability.
            6.8.2.3.3. Present Medical Support. Current therapy and treatment requirements.
            6.8.2.3.4. Present Duty Performance. Member's functional impairment as it relates to
            ability to perform duties.
            6.8.2.3.5. Statement of Opinion. The examining physician may include an opinion as to
            whether he or she still considers the member medically acceptable for retention in LAS.
            If considered acceptable, the physician also specifies if the present assignment limitations
            remain valid and whether he or she still considers the member physically unfit for return
            to full military duty.
     6.8.3. AFPC Action. Upon receipt, HQ AFPC/DPPD sends the current physical examination and
     the entire LAS case file to HQ AFPC/DPAMM for review.
        6.8.3.1. HQ AFPC/DPAMM Action. Review the case and determine if the member is still
        acceptable for retention in LAS and, if acceptable, whether a change in assignment
        limitations is appropriate. Advise HQ AFPC/DPPD of any change in limitations. If the
        member is no longer acceptable for LAS retention, direct MEB action as outlined in AFI 48-
        123 and this instruction.
        6.8.3.2. Assignment Resource Manager Action. When HQ AFPC/DPAMM recommends
        retention in LAS, the resource manager, as identified in paragraph 6.6.2, reviews the case to
AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006                                                                    59


      determine if they can still justify LAS assignment. After review, the resource manager
      returns the case to HQ AFPC/DPPD indicating whether continued LAS is, or is not, justified.
      6.8.3.3. HQ AFPC/DPPD Action. Advise the member by memorandum, through the MPF,
      of the final decision concerning retention in LAS. When the member is no longer medically
      acceptable for LAS, or when the LAS assignment is no longer justifiable, initiate MEB
      action. If approving retention in LAS, include any change in assignment limitation in the
      approval notice.
6.9. Exceptions to Normal LAS Reevaluations. Upon receiving information indicating further
LAS retention may not be appropriate, HQ AFPC/DPPD may send the case file to HQ
AFPC/DPAMM or the proper functional resource manager for review, direct an MEB and PEB, or
take any other action necessary to determine if the member's continued retention on LAS is
appropriate.

                                              Chapter 7

                PERIODIC EXAMINATION OF MEMBERS ON THE TDRL

Section 7A—TDRL Examination Rules

7.1. Requirement for Periodic Examination. The law, 10 U.S.C. 1210, requires reexamination
of all members on the TDRL at least once every 18 months to determine if there has been a change in
the disability that resulted in their placement on the TDRL. These periodic examinations continue
until final disposition or until the statutory period expires (currently 5 years) whichever is earlier.
     7.1.1. HQ AFPC/DPPD usually schedules the initial examination 16 months after placing the
     member on the TDRL so the medical facility can complete it before the end of the 18th month.
     They schedule the examination at the Air Force medical facility closest to the member's home
     that has the required capability, or the closest DoD medical facility if indicated by the member's
     medical condition.
7.2. Importance of Processing TDRL Examinations Rapidly. Many TDRL members must
leave school or their jobs to report for examination, and any undue delay may cause hardship. HQ
AFPC/DPPD notifies everyone concerned approximately 20-30 days in advance of the scheduled
reporting date and time for the examination. The members must report on time, and the medical
facility must complete the examination without delay.
7.3. Failure to Report for Periodic Examinations. In accordance with the law (10 U.S.C. 1210)
TDRL members who fail to report for periodic examinations, after having been properly notified,
will have their retired pay terminated. All members on the TDRL shall advise HQ AFPC/DPPD of
their current mailing address. In this way, members will receive important notices on periodic
examinations, as well as other correspondence of interest.
7.4. Procedures for Periodic Examinations.
     7.4.1. About 60 days before the reporting date, HQ AFPC/DPPD sends the previous TDRL
     medical records and any special instructions to the examining facility and requests a TDRL
     medical examination appointment.
     7.4.2. Within 10 days of receiving the request, the examining facility will call or send a message
     to HQ AFPC/DPPDS giving the date and time of the appointment, and indicating whether they
     will evaluate the member on inpatient or outpatient status.
     7.4.3. If the medical facility can not conduct the examination, they must return the records
     within 15 days to HQ AFPC/DPPDS -If appropriate, HQ AFPC/DPPDS then schedules the
     examination at another facility as quickly as possible, or returns the package for necessary
     processing.
     7.4.4. The member shall provide to the examining physician, for submission to the PEB, copies
     of all his or her medical records (civilian, VA, and all military medical records) documenting
     treatment since the last examination.
     7.4.5. If the member is being treated by a civilian physician or the VA and member provides
     them directly to HQ AFPC/DPPDS, HQ AFPC/DPPDS will provide the information to the PEB
     for review. If the PEB determines that the report is sufficient to evaluate the member, the
     scheduled appointment at the MTF will be canceled.
AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006                                                                        61


   7.4.6. If the member fails to report for the examination on the scheduled reporting date, the
   medical facility must advise HQ AFPC/DPPDS immediately and await further instructions.
   7.4.7. Telephone Counseling. TDRL members may call HQ AFPC/DPPDS toll-free at 1-800-
   531-5806 for information or counseling regarding their periodic examination or the findings and
   recommended disposition of the IPEB.
7.5. Travel and Per Diem Allowance. Members traveling to a medical facility for examination,
or to Lackland AFB TX for the formal PEB, receive travel and per diem allowance based on their
retired grade (10 U.S.C. 1210 and JFTR volume 1, chapter 7, part I). The Air Force reimburses them
for the cost of travel to and from the examining facility or the formal PEB as well as certain other
costs, such as meals and lodging, at about the same rates as AD members of the same grade in TDY
status. Members are not authorized use of rental vehicles.
7.6. Travel Orders. About 20-30 days before the reporting date, HQ AFPC/DPPD sends travel
orders to the member. The order shows the exact date, time, and place to report and includes the
authority for payment of travel costs. The orders and the accompanying information sheets contain
instructions for the members on what they need to do and their entitlements.
7.7. Orders Processing by the Examining Facility. The medical facility endorses the order to
show whether they examined the member as an inpatient or outpatient, the dates and times the
member reported and was released after completing the examination. If the examination was in
outpatient status, tell whether or not the member occupied government quarters. The examining
facility must ensure the member has an indorsed order to submit with the claim for reimbursement.
The member submits a travel voucher to 12 CPTS/FMFL for reimbursement. FMFL must also
approve all advances.
7.8. Authorized Escort. An escort may accompany a member to the place of examination or to the
formal PEB when the member is not physically or mentally able to travel without help. Submit the
request and supporting documents for review by HQ AFPC/DPPD before beginning travel. If
approved, HQ AFPC/DPPD includes the authority for an escort's travel in the member's travel order.
The attendant may file a claim for expenses according to JFTR, volume 1, chapter 7, part I.
However, if traveling by private conveyance, the Air Force will reimburse only the retired member
for transportation costs.
7.9. Purpose and Scope of TDRL Reevaluation. The purpose of the periodic examination is to
determine if the condition for which the member was retired has changed since retirement or since
the previous TDRL evaluation. The medical facility conducts the examination according to AFI 48-
123.
   7.9.1. The report of examination centers on the unfitting defects and conditions and includes
   anything the examining physician discovers or observes as to what the member is actually able to
   do or not do.
   7.9.2. The examination also includes information on any other defect or condition incurred or
   discovered after the member's retirement. For any newly identified defect or condition, the report
   indicates whether the member incurred the condition while on active duty or while on TDRL.
   For any change to an old defect or condition, the narrative summary indicates whether the
   condition is better or worse than at the time of retirement.
   7.9.3. The examining facility performs the necessary diagnostic, laboratory, and radiological
   procedures which clearly and accurately establish the member's current status. Include the
   following in the final report: test results, a statement as to the normal test value for the
62                                                              AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006


     procedures done, copies of consultations, and a statement identifying all medications the member
     is currently taking.
     7.9.4. The examining physician includes medical statements and opinions in the report of
     examination when such information may help the PEB evaluate the member's current condition.
     However, since prior TDRL medical records are available to the PEB and higher levels of
     review, do not repeat information in previous records except to make a point. The physician will
     include a detailed statement of interim history describing social, industrial, or educational
     activity, as well as the medical prognosis. References to the administrative disposition of the
     member, such as return to active duty, retention on TDRL, permanent retirement, discharge for
     disability, or probable percentage of disability are not appropriate and frequently lead to
     unnecessary questions or disappointment for the member.
     7.9.5. Insurance Claims. The examining DoD medical facility may bill the reasonable costs of
     the TDRL examination to a third-party payer such as an insurance company or a medical service
     or health plan under which the member is a covered beneficiary (10 U.S.C. 1095). Additionally,
     please note the following:
        7.9.5.1. Do not bill the member for costs not paid (such as required deductibles or co-
        payments).
        7.9.5.2. If the third-party payer asks the member to clarify the charges, resource
        management personnel at the DoD medical facility will help in completing any additional
        claim forms.
        7.9.5.3. Do not release confidential drug and alcohol treatment records without a patient
        consent executed according to federal law and Public Health Service regulations. A general
        consent form to release "medical records" or an assignment of third-party payer benefits will
        not satisfy Public Health Service requirements.
7.10. Processing at the Examining Facility. The commander of the examining facility or
designated representative makes sure the medical facility completes the examination as quickly as
possible so the member may return home without delay.
     7.10.1. Time Limits. Follow these general rules:
        7.10.1.1. When possible, complete the examination within 1 to 3 duty days after the member
        arrives at the examining facility.
        7.10.1.2. Only extend the examination period if the examining physician believes a short
        period of observation or medical testing is absolutely essential for a complete report. Hold
        such examinations to a minimum.
        7.10.1.3. The DoD requirement is to provide medical reports to HQ AFPC/DPPD within 30
        days of examination.
        7.10.1.4. Do not send the case to HQ AFPC/DPPD until all laboratory studies and
        consultations have been completed and included in the report. If the MTF can not complete
        the report of examination within the required period, advise HQ AFPC/DPPD in writing of
        the reason for delay and give an estimated date of report completion. Never keep the
        member at the examining facility pending review of laboratory test results or to await typing
        of the report.
AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006                                                                           63


    7.10.2. Report of Examination. The examining medical facility must send the completed report
    and all previously loaned medical records to HQ AFPC/DPPDS. The completed report consists
    of SF 502 and the results of all laboratory procedures and consultations. Further, the service
    member shall provide copies of all civilian, VA, and military medical records documenting
    treatment since the last TDRL reevaluation. Submit the narrative summary in original plus two
    legible copies.
    7.10.3. Competency Rules. If the member was mentally incompetent when last examined and
    there has been a change in competency since then, or if there is a question as to mental
    competency, the examining military facility must convene a competency board according to
    DFAS-DE 177-373, volume 1, chapter 24, Joint Uniform Pay System - DJMS AFO Procedures
    and AFI 48-123. A competency ruling will not be required for members evaluated at VA or
    civilian medical facilities. In these cases, the member or an NOK must contact DFAS-CL to
    arrange for a change in competency. Take the following action:
        7.10.3.1. Include a copy of the board's competency determination with the report of
        examination when sending it to HQ AFPC/DPPD.
        7.10.3.2. Send a copy of the competency board to DFAS-CL/FRAA.
        7.10.3.3. If it would be harmful or against the member's best interest to know his or her
        medical condition, the examining physician will point that out in the narrative summary. HQ
        AFPC/DPPD will then process the case accordingly.
7.11. TDRL Members Imprisoned or Confined by Civil Authorities. The law requires
periodic examination, regardless of the member's status or circumstances. For members imprisoned
or confined by civil authorities, HQ AFPC/DPPD requests a report of examination and a copy of the
commitment order, when appropriate, from the confinement institution.
    7.11.1. If the report received contains sufficient information, the PEB uses it to evaluate the
    member. If the report is inadequate, or if the institution does not send a report, HQ AFPC/DPPD
    sends the case to SAFPC for review and disposition.

Section 7B—Review by IPEB and FPEB

7.12. IPEB Review of the TDRL Examination. HQ AFPC/DPPD refers reports of examination
with prior medical records and allied papers to the IPEB for evaluation as outlined in Chapter 3.
7.13. Additional Medical Workup. If the report of examination is inadequate, HQ AFPC/DPPD
returns it to the examining facility for more data, or takes other action as necessary to get a complete
and adequate report. HQ AFPC/DPPD may direct the member to report to another facility for
additional medical workup, or to 59 Med Wg (WHMC), Lackland AFB TX, for complete
examination followed by a PEB. HQ AFPC/DPPD issues another set of travel orders when
applicable.
7.14. Changes in Prior Determinations. Do not change prior findings such as LOD, proximate
result, EPTS factor, and so on, unless there is new and compelling evidence not available to the
original board that establishes that the initial determination was in error. Determinations of armed
conflict and instrumentality of war are binding so long as the defect remains unfitting.
    7.14.1. Conditions found not unfitting when placed on the TDRL are not compensable if they
    become unfitting while on the TDRL. However, if reevaluation reveals the condition was
    unfitting when the member was placed on the TDRL, the evaluating board lists the condition as
64                                                                  AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006


     compensable when making permanent disposition of the case, and documents the reasons for
     making the change in item 15, AF Form 356. Since the board cannot retroactively change the
     member's records as of the date placed on the TDRL, HQ AFPC/DPPD will tell the member that
     he or she may apply for records correction through the AFBCMR process.
7.15. Action by AFPC and Member After IPEB. HQ AFPC/DPPD sends to the member the AF
Form 356, a copy of the TDRL report of exam, and a memorandum outlining actions required. When
the IPEB recommends removal from the TDRL, the member may agree with the board's
recommendation, disagree and request a formal PEB, or waive the formal PEB and submit a written
rebuttal. When the board recommends retention on the TDRL, HQ AFPC/DPPD advises the member
of the action but does not give the member the option to agree or disagree (see paragraph 7.25).
     7.15.1. Time Limits. The member is provided 30 calendar days to reply when the IPEB
     recommends final disposition in the case. Upon request, HQ AFPC/DPPD may grant additional
     time if needed. If there is no response within the time limit, HQ AFPC/DPPD will presume the
     member concurs and the case will be finalized.
     7.15.2. Member Agrees or Submits a Rebuttal to the IPEB Findings.                  HQ AFPC/DPPD
     processes the case as outlined in Chapter 3 and Chapter 5.
     7.15.3. When Physically Fit. When the recommended disposition of the IPEB is "Removal from
     the TDRL (Fit)," HQ AFPC/DPPDS sends a memorandum to the member with a 30 day suspense
     outlining action required. HQ AFPC/DPPDS will notify the appropriate offices; i.e., promotions,
     enlisted retention, officer appointments and officer procurement.
        7.15.3.1. If eligible for return to active duty, HQ AFPC/DPPD sends the member one copy
        of Statement Relative to Appointment or Enlistment After Removal from TDRL
        along with the informal board's findings and recommendation. The member must make a
        decision and return the form within 30 calendar days. Except as stated in paragraph 7.15.4, if
        the member does not respond within the 30-day time limit, HQ AFPC/DPPD will process the
        case as if the member did not desire appointment or enlistment.
        7.15.3.2. If a member was serving on AD as a non-EAD ARC officer when placed on the
        TDRL, HQ AFPC/DPPD will refer him or her to the nearest ARC facility for further
        processing.
        7.15.3.3. In addition to permitting return to duty under 10 U.S.C. 1211, the law (10 U.S.C.
        1210) provides that members removed from the TDRL as fit will be discharged, retired, or
        transferred to the inactive Reserve under any other law if, under that law, the members
        applies for and qualifies for that retirement or transfer, or is required to be discharged, retired,
        or eliminated from an active status. The member's grade is determined under the provisions
        of law for which retired, transferred, discharged, or eliminated from an active status. Retired,
        retainer, severance, readjustment, or separation pay is computed as if the member had been
        reappointed or reenlisted upon removal from the TDRL and before the retirement, transfer,
        discharge, or elimination. (See paragraph 7.27 for service retirement procedures involving
        members removed from the TDRL.)
        7.15.3.4. Members found fit who do not elect enlistment or reappointment, and who are not
        discharged, retired, or transferred to the inactive Reserve as indicated in paragraph 7.15.3.3,
        will be discharged without benefits, subject to restriction in paragraph 7.15.4
     7.15.4. Obligated Service. By law, members who entered military service after 1 June 1984
     must serve 8 years in the armed services, unless sooner discharged. Do not discharge TDRL
AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006                                                                        65


   members found fit who entered military service after 1 June 1984, served less than 8 years, and
   do not want to be reappointed nor to enlist. Instead, when removing them from the TDRL,
   transfer them to the USAFR (Obligated Reserve Section), and assign them to the Air Reserve
   Personnel Center (ARPC) to complete their military service obligation. Time spent on the TDRL
   counts toward the required obligated service.
7.16. Documentation Provided To the FPEB. When a formal hearing is to be held, HQ
AFPC/DPPD sends the TDRL examination, medical records, and related documents to the FPEB. If
the FPEB decides it needs more medical data, they may refer the member to 59 Med Wg (WHMC)
for specific tests, consultations, or medical workups. The FPEB must specify the conditions that
require evaluation and identify any other information needed. The FPEB president recesses the
hearing pending receipt of the additional data.
7.17. Directed Examination Followed by FPEB Hearing. HQ AFPC/DPPD can direct a
complete medical workup and formal hearing when they determine that it is in the best interests of
the member or the Air Force. HQ AFPC/DPPD schedules the examination at 59 Med Wg (WHMC),
and prepares and sends orders directing the member to report to 59 Med Wg (WHMC) for the
required examination. The examination follows the general guidelines in this chapter.
   7.17.1. Time Limits. 59 Med Wg (WHMC) must complete the medical workup and
   examination as quickly as possible--10 to 14 days maximum. If medical personnel at 59 Med Wg
   (WHMC) need more time, they must advise HQ AFPC/DPPD and the FPEB of reasons for the
   delay and the expected completion date. As soon as 59 Med Wg (WHMC) completes the medical
   examination, the member will appear before the FPEB.
7.18. Special Considerations for TDRL Members. The FPEB hearing for a member on the
TDRL proceeds as outlined in Chapter 3, Section 3C. The following special considerations apply:
   7.18.1. FPEB In Absentia. When the retired member does not or cannot appear in person, HQ
   AFPC/ DPPD approves and HQ AFPC/DPPDF convenes a formal hearing in absentia. In such
   cases, legal counsel must be present during all open sessions. The NOK (or guardian) may also
   be present and act for the member. Examples of when hearings will be held in absentia, include,
   member:
       7.18.1.1. Is hospitalized, confined, incarcerated, or otherwise unable to travel freely.
       7.18.1.2. Is unable to travel because of his or her physical or mental condition.
       7.18.1.3. Is unable to act in his or her own behalf because he or she is incompetent or
       because knowledge of the condition or disability would be harmful to the member.
   7.18.2. Excusal from Hearing. A retired member may request to be excused from personally
   appearing at a hearing. This request is not be confused with the formal hearing that is held in
   absentia (paragraph 7.18.1). The FPEB president at his discretion may approve a retired
   member's request for excusal. The record of the hearing must clearly show that this was a
   voluntary act by the member. In such cases, the designated legal counsel represents the member
   during all open sessions. The member remains in the area until the FPEB completes its action.
   Excusal does not keep the FPEB from referring the member to 59 Med Wg (WHMC) for medical
   consultations if needed.
7.19. Personal Appearance. The TDRL member must appear before the FPEB, unless the FPEB
conducts the hearing in absentia, or the board president excused the member from the hearing.
7.20. Disposition Options of the Formal Hearing. Same as for IPEB (see paragraph 3.29).
66                                                                  AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006


7.21. Special Actions When Member Is Found Fit. When the FPEB recommends "Removal
from TDRL (Fit)," the FPEB counsel or other designated counsel:
     7.21.1. Provides member a memorandum outlining action required, election statement of intent
     to seek reenlistment, reappointment or service retirement, if appropriate, and a fact sheet to aid
     member in making election. Fact sheet includes points of contact for any questions they may
     have. Member is allowed two weeks to reply to HQ AFPC/DPPDS.
     7.21.2. Advises members who were serving on active duty as USAFR or ANG officers when
     placed on the TDRL to contact their appropriate Reserve component for further processing.
     7.21.3. Advises members who entered the military service on or after 1 June 1984 and served
     less than 8 years of the obligated service provision of 10 U.S.C. 651 as outlined in paragraph
     7.15.4
     7.21.4. Counsels enlisted members that HQ AFPC/DPPA will review their records to determine
     if they are eligible to reenlist. If ineligible, they do not have the option to reenlist, and will be
     discharged without disability benefits.

Section 7C—AFPC Disposition Actions

7.22. Final Review and Disposition Actions. HQ AFPC/DPPD announces the final disposition
on a computer format, Retirement Special Order - Physically Unfit, or Retirement Special
Order Removal From TDRL. These orders are the official notice to TDRL members of final
disposition action. Retaining a member on TDRL is not a final disposition (see paragraph 7.24).
7.23. Stopping Retired Pay. Retired pay stops when TDRL members are removed from the
TDRL or when the statutory period of retention on TDRL according to 10 U.S.C. 1210h expires.
     7.23.1. HQ AFPC/DPPD may also stop a member's eligibility to receive Air Force retired pay if
     the member is scheduled to report for periodic examination and refuses or fails to report after
     having been given proper notice or fails to provide all his or her medical records (civilian, VA,
     and all military medical records) documenting treatment since the last examination. Rules for
     reinstatement are:
         7.23.1.1. If the member later reports, reinstate eligibility to receive retired pay effective on
         the date the member reports and completes the examination.
         7.23.1.2. If the member can show "just cause" for not reporting, reinstate eligibility to
         receive retired pay retroactively for a period of not more than 1 year (10 U.S.C. 1210a).
         7.23.1.3. If the member does not undergo periodic examinations after disability retired pay
         has been terminated, they will be administratively removed from the TDRL on the fifth
         anniversary of placement on the list and separated without entitlement to any disability
         benefits.
     7.23.2. For TDRL members found fit and reappointed or enlisted, disability retired pay stops on
     the date removed from TDRL.
7.24. Removal From TDRL for Failure To Report or Reply. HQ AFPC/DPPD will process as
follows:
     7.24.1. Failure To Report for Periodic Examination. Under provisions of this chapter, HQ
     AFPC/ DPPD schedules members nearing the 5th anniversary of the date placed on the TDRL for
AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006                                                                       67


   periodic examination. If these members refuse or fail to report after having been properly
   notified, or if HQ AFPC/DPPDS cannot locate the TDRL member, HQ AFPC/DPPDS refers the
   case to the IPEB, with a detailed account of all relevant circumstances. Possible follow-on
   actions:
       7.24.1.1. The IPEB may recommend permanent disability retirement, discharge with
       entitlement to disability severance pay, or removal from the TDRL and discharge without
       benefits.
       7.24.1.2. The designated special assistant to SAFPC may confirm and approve the IPEB's
       recommended disposition, refer the case to the FPEB for a formal hearing in absentia, or to
       SAFPC for final disposition.
   7.24.2. Members Found Fit Who Fail To Respond as Required. HQ AFPC/DPPD will remove
   from the TDRL and discharge without benefits TDRL members who have been found fit and fail
   to reply within the time limit to the notification of the fit finding. HQ AFPC/DPPD will also
   remove from the TDRL and discharge without benefits a TDRL member who is found fit,
   requests a FPEB hearing, and fails to report to the FPEB.
7.25. Retention on TDRL. When the IPEB recommends retention on TDRL, HQ AFPC/DPPD
furnishes the member a copy of AF Form 356, copy of TDRL report of exam, and a memorandum
advising there is no change in member's status or Air Force retired pay as long as the member's name
remains on the TDRL regardless of whether or not there is a change in percentage rating. HQ
AFPC/DPPD's memorandum of notification includes an approximate date for the next examination
and tells the member that instructions, and a firm date, and designated place of examination will be
sent approximately 20-30 days before the examination date.
7.26. Enlistment, Reappointment, or Retirement (TERA) After Removal from TDRL as
Fit. Upon recommendation of the IPEB be removed from the TDRL as fit:
   7.26.1. Enlistment or Reappointment Grade. The appropriate promotions office determines the
   grade of enlistment or reappointment and advises HQ AFPC/DPPD.
   7.26.2. Enlistment. HQ AFPC/DPPDS tells members what date they will remove them from the
   TDRL and that members will have 60 calendar days from the date removed during which they
   may enlist without a physical examination. HQ AFPC/DPPDS provides instructions for the
   member to present to the MPF when reporting for enlistment. After the 60-day period, former
   TDRL members follow the same enlistment rules that apply to any other civilian.
   7.26.3. Retirement (TERA). Members who meet basic eligibility requirements for the TERA
   will be referred to HQ AFPC/DPPR to apply.
   7.26.4. Reappointment of Certain ARC Officers. HQ ARPC/DPRB, reappoints ARC officers
   being assigned to a Reserve component (not retiring and not returning to AD).
7.27. Service Retirement of Members Being Removed from TDRL. Members who are fit, or
who are unfit because of a condition incurred or aggravated while on TDRL after having recovered
from the condition for which placed on the TDRL, may apply for service retirement if eligible under
AFI 36-3203. HQ AFPC/DPPDS provides the appropriate application forms, and HQ AFPC/DPPR
issues orders effecting removal from TDRL on the last day of the month and service retirement on
the first day of the following month so there is no loss of pay.
68                                                                 AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006


                                              Chapter 8

           EVALUATION OF AIR RESERVE COMPONENT (ARC) MEMBERS

Section 8A—General Guidelines

8.1. Purpose. This chapter provides the guidelines for processing through the disability system
certain ARC members who meet eligibility requirements in paragraph 8.2 Paragraph 8.3 gives an
ineligibility guideline. The Air Force disability system will evaluate ARC members who meet the
basic requirements for disability benefits under 10 U.S.C., chapter 61. Further, Ready Reserve
members who are pending separation for a non-duty related impairment and Reserve members who
are not on a call to active duty of more than 30 days and who are medically disqualified for
impairments unrelated to the member's military status and performance of duty shall be afforded the
opportunity to enter the disability system for a determination of fitness only but shall not be afforded
disability benefits (see section E).
8.2. Eligibility for Disability Processing. The following ARC members who have impairments
which were incurred or aggravated in the line of duty are eligible for disability processing:
     8.2.1. On active duty for 31 days or more while the member was entitled to basic pay.
     8.2.2. After 23 Sep 96, on active duty for 31 days or more but not entitled to basic pay under 37
     U.S.C. 502(B) due to authorized absence to participate in an educational program, or for an
     emergency purpose, as determined by the SAF or designated representative.
     8.2.3. On active duty for 30 days or less or on call to Inactive Duty Training (IDT).
        8.2.3.1. While traveling directly to or from the place at which such duty is performed; and/or
        8.2.3.2. After September 23, l996, any injury, illness, or disease incurred or aggravated
        while remaining overnight, between successive periods of IDT, at or in the vicinity of the site
        of the inactive duty training, if the site is outside reasonable commuting distance of the
        member's residence.
        8.2.3.3. Additionally, members of the Ready Reserve with nonduty-related impairments
        pending separation for failure to meet physical standards. (See eligibility criteria in Section
        8E).
8.3. Ineligibility for Disability Processing. ARC members are ineligible for disability processing
if the member is pending an approved, unsuspended, punitive discharge or dismissal.
8.4. Misconduct. In order for ARC members to be compensated for disabilities incurred while in
active duty or inactive duty status, the PEB must find that the unfitting condition was not the result of
intentional misconduct or willful neglect and was not incurred during a period of unauthorized
absence.
8.5. Entitlement to Medical Care and Evaluation. AFI 41-115, Authorized Health Care and
Health Care Benefits in the Military Health Services Systems (MHSS) outlines an ARC member's
possible entitlement to medical care when not on active duty, including hospitalization for evaluation
of physical defects or conditions incurred as a result of performing authorized military duty. If there
is any question as to a member's entitlement to medical care and evaluation, the medical facility takes
action to verify such entitlement.
AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006                                                                           69


8.6. Duty and Pay Status:
   8.6.1. An ARC member who incurs a disability while performing AD on orders for 30 days or
   less is not ordered or continued on AD past the date specified solely for processing under this
   instruction. However, the member is eligible to receive medical care and evaluation. Members
   with disabilities incurred or aggravated after 29 September 1988 may also be entitled to pay and
   allowances; however, the amount received is reduced by the full amount of civilian income
   received during the disability period. Limit payment to a maximum of 6 months unless SAF
   extends the period after determining it is in the interest of fairness and equity to do so (37 U.S.C.
   204(g) and [h]).
   8.6.2. ARC members who incur or aggravate an injury, illness or disease in the line of duty
   while on orders for more than 30 days are not involuntarily released from those orders until final
   disposition of their disability case. These members' entitlement to full pay and allowances and
   benefits continue to the same extent provided by law or regulation to regular component
   members.
8.7. Movement of Member. The PEBLO or medical facility commander advises the member's
unit commander or MPF of the disposition or movement to another medical facility or to travel to
meet a FPEB. When such movement is necessary, the medical facility issues appropriate orders to
authorize the movement.

Section 8B—Administrative Processing

8.8. Records for PEB. When referring an ARC/Ready Reserve member's case to the PEB, the
PEBLO at the referring facility obtains all prior medical and related records for use by the PEB
following these procedures:
   8.8.1. Modify the text of the request for prior medical records as follows: "PEB pending for
   (grade, name, SSN). Request all medical and clinical records (include places and date of
   hospitalization and register number, if known). Member claims prior service in (Branch of
   Service or (state)) National Guard from ____________ to ____________ under service numbers
   ________________."
   8.8.2. Send the request to the custodian of the MPerGp as specified in AFI 36-2608, Military
   Personnel Records Systems.
   8.8.3. Send an information copy of the request to the Records Management Division (HQ
   AFPC/ DPSR), for IMA’s send a copy to HQ AFPC/DRSP.
   8.8.4. If the member had military service other than Air Force, send a copy to the National
   Personnel Records Center, Air Force Reference Branch (NPRC/NRPMF-C).
8.9. Case Records for the PEB. Assemble as outlined in AFI 48-123. If the PEBLO can not
locate all the needed documents, the PEBLO includes a statement to that effect for the case file.
Send cases to the PEB through the SG and DP offices of the appropriate headquarters—ANG (ANG
members), HQ AFRC (unit members), or HQ ARPC (individual mobilization augmentees). Cases on
Reserve component personnel on EAD or undergoing initial active duty for training do not require
headquarters review.
8.10. Case Processing. Upon determining a member to be eligible for disability evaluation,
process the case according to Chapter 3, Chapter 4, and Chapter 5. Section 8C of this chapter
70                                                                AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006


outlines special processing rules. HQ AFPC/DPPD may grant other exceptions to normal processing
when such action is in the best interest of the member and the Air Force.
8.11. Other Administrative Actions. Do not retire or discharge a member whose case is
undergoing disability evaluation until completion of the disability case. Do not administratively
discharge under AFI 36-3209, Separation Procedures for Air National Guard and Air Force
Reserve Member, members retired or discharged for disability under this instruction.
8.12. Movement of Member to FPEB. If HQ AFPC/DPPD schedules an ARC member to meet a
FPEB, the PEBLO or medical facility commander arranges for movement of the member and
prepares orders placing member on TDY to 59 Med Wg (WHMC) to meet the formal PEB (See
Section 3C, Chapter 3). EXCEPTION: Members of the ARC with a non-duty related medical
condition are responsible for their personal travel and other expenses.

Section 8C—Special Case Processing

8.13. Waiver of PEB Action in EPTS Cases. A member whose physical qualification for
military duty is questionable because of an EPTS condition, and whose case is being considered for
PEB action under this chapter, may waive evaluation by a PEB subject to conditions outlined below.
If the case does not meet all the criteria for waiver or if the member requests evaluation by a PEB,
the appropriate headquarters or medical facility will refer the case to the PEB. Also refer a case to
the PEB when the member fails or refuses to sign a waiver. Cases must meet the following
conditions:
     8.13.1. Member's qualification to perform duties of his or her office, grade, or rank is
     questionable, as determined by medical board action.
     8.13.2. The disqualifying defect or condition existed before entry on current period of duty and
     such duty has not aggravated the defect or condition.
     8.13.3. Knowing about his or her medical condition would not be harmful to the member's well
     being.
     8.13.4. The member does not require further hospitalization or institutional care.
     8.13.5. After being advised of the right to a full and fair hearing, member still desires to waive
     PEB action.
     8.13.6. Member knows he or she must undergo PEB evaluation to receive Air Force disability
     benefits, if applicable, but waiving PEB evaluation will not prevent applying for VA benefits.
     8.13.7. Member knows that he or she will go home under applicable USAFR or ANG directives
     to await the final outcome of the case.
     8.13.8. Member knows final action on the case may result in discharge, and that he or she may
     not withdraw PEB waiver action under this chapter.
8.14. Waiver Processing. Prepare the waiver statement in three copies using the format at
Attachment 5. The commander of the medical facility processing the case, or a designated
representative, distributes the original and two copies of the waiver statement as follows:
     8.14.1. Original. Send with the original AF Form 618, narrative summary, and memorandum of
     notification to the appropriate addressee as follows:
AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006                                                                        71


       8.14.1.1. USAFR Members: HQ ARPC/DPA for Individual Mobilization Augmentees

   8.14.2. First Copy. Send with a legible copy of AF Form 618 and narrative summary to the
   member's unit commander or MPF for file with the health records in the Field Records Group.
   For IMAs, send to HQ ARPC/DRSP.
   8.14.3. Second Copy. Give to member.
   8.14.4. Completing the Memorandum of Notification to ARC Headquarters.
       8.14.4.1. Wording: "(Grade, name) is not considered to be physically qualified for military
       duty and has waived further evaluation by a Physical Evaluation Board (PEB). Attached are
       the Medical Board Report and medical summary, with the member's statement waiving PEB
       action, for disposition of the member under applicable directives. The member will go home
       to await your final action."
       8.14.4.2. If the member is on AD undergoing training, the medical facility commander may
       send the Medical Board Report and waiver statement to the servicing MPF where the
       member is training. The MPF completes the discharge processing and advises the USAFR or
       ANG of final action.
8.15. Disposition of Ineligible Member. An ineligible member is one not physically qualified for
military service but who does not qualify for PEB evaluation under this instruction. The medical
facility commander or designated representative must advise member that he or she is not eligible for
processing under this instruction; cannot stay in a duty status; and will be returned home to await
discharge under applicable USAFR or ANG directives.
   8.15.1. After completing inpatient or outpatient medical treatment or medical processing, the
   medical facility commander sends the member home to await discharge. The MTF commander
   sends a memorandum of notification to the ARC headquarters with a copy to the member and to
   the unit commander (or MPF) that includes a detailed medical summary describing the member's
   disqualifying defects. Send notifications to the following offices: For USAFR Category A unit
   members, HQ AFRC/SGP; for IMAs, HQ ARPC/DPA; for ANG members, ANG/MPPSS.
   8.15.2. The medical facility commander prepares the notification memorandum in three copies
   with the following wording: ("Grade, name) is not considered to be physically qualified for
   military duty, and is not eligible for processing by a PEB. The attached medical summary reflects
   the member's current physical status. Please take immediate action to ensure proper disposition of
   the member under applicable directives. The member is being returned home to await final
   disposition."

Section 8D—Final Disposition

8.16. Disposition of Eligible Member.
   8.16.1. Return to Duty by a Medical Board. If an MEB finds an ARC member physically
   qualified for military service and returns the member to duty, the medical facility commander
   returns the member to the unit of assignment or, if the period of duty has expired, sends the
   member home. Send a copy of AF Form 618 to the unit commander or MPF for file with the
   health records in the member's Field Records Group. NOTE: For unit-assigned Reservists, HQ
72                                                                AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006


     AFRC/SGP and ANG/SGP will provide disposition instructions to the member's medical unit and
     distribute the final board report to the appropriate Reserve agencies.
     8.16.2. Disposition After PEB Evaluation. After the member has either agreed with the PEB or
     submitted a rebuttal, the referring medical facility commander takes one of the following actions:
        8.16.2.1. Physically Fit. Returns the member to the unit of assignment or, if the period of
        service has expired, sends the member home.
        8.16.2.2. Physically Unfit. If the member does not require further hospitalization, return the
        member home to await final disposition action. If the member requires hospitalization after
        retirement or discharge, the referring medical facility commander takes action as outlined in
        AFIs 48-123 and 41-115.
8.17. Final AFPC Processing After PEB Evaluation. After final disposition, HQ AFPC/DPPD
advises the ARC headquarters, prepares retirement orders or discharge information, and mails the
case file to the ARC headquarters, as applicable. The ARC addressee completes retirement or
discharge processing, including removal from status, if applicable, and issues appropriate instructions
to the MPF.
     8.17.1. HQ AFPC/DPPD may contact the member's MPF directly if necessary to ensure timely
     action on any retirement or discharge. When the final disposition is discharge without severance
     pay, HQ AFPC/DPPD may direct the MPF to discharge the member and notify the USAFR or
     ANG of the completed action. Offices are:
        8.17.1.1. HQ ARPC/DPA for USAFR member not assigned to a specific Reserve unit.
        8.17.1.2. AFRC/DPM for USAFR member assigned to a Reserve unit.
        8.17.1.3. ANG/MPPSS for ANG member.
8.18. Inactive Status List (ISL) Transfers. Per 10 USC 1209, ARC members approved for
disability discharge under 10 U.S.C. 1203 or 1206 and who have 20 or more years of satisfactory
federal service computed under 10 U.S.C. 12732 may elect either disability discharge with severance
pay, or transfer to ISL with retirement at age 60 under 10 U.S.C. 12732. Per 10 USC 12731D,
Selected Reserve members who have 15, but less than 20 years satisfactory service, the last 6 years
of which was Reserve duty, may apply for early qualification for retired pay at age 60.

Section 8E—ARC Non-Duty Related Impairments

8.19. Eligibility.
     8.19.1. Any member of the Ready Reserve who is pending separation for a non-duty related
     impairment shall be afforded the opportunity to enter the DES for a determination of fitness. If

                                          Attachment 2
                               COUNSELING THE EVALUEE
A2.1. Purpose for Counseling. To ensure all members undergoing disability evaluation fully
understand the process, the PEBLO counsels them on at least two occasions: when the case
enters the disability evaluation system at the referring facility, and again when the PEB
completes its action. PEBLOs will not speculate about the possible case disposition or
percentage of disability in counseling evaluees. When members request a formal hearing, the
PEBLO counsels them at the referring facility, then the appointed military counsel counsels them
before and after the hearing. Counseling varies, depending on the circumstances in each case.
Information in this attachment, as well as other parts of this instruction, will answer most
questions. In addition, HQ AFPC/DPPD prepares and distributes a "Disability Counseling Guide
for PEB Liaison Officers" to assist in counseling. However, the PEBLO or PEB counsel should
contact HQ AFPC/DPPD if they need help.

A2.2. Counseling Materials. The PEBLO and the PEB counsel must have ready access to
copies of this instruction, AFPD 36-32, DoD Directive l332.l8, DoDI 1332.39 (Application of
the Veterans Administration for Rating Disabilities), as well as copies of AFI 48-123, and the
VASRD. Make these directives available to the member while the case is being processed. Prior
to acting on a Service member's request for a formal PEB, review with the member the
applicable standard detailed in the VASRD or DoD Instruction 1332.39. If member requests a
FPEB hearing, encourage them to submit a rebuttal to the PEB. The PEBLO and the PEB
counsel have access to other Air Force directives, the Joint Federal Travel Regulation
(JFTR), the Manual for Courts Martial (MCM) and any other materials that would be helpful in
counseling the member.

A2.3. Information on Percentage Ratings. Refer to specific parts of the VASRD and DoD
Directive 1332.39 for an explanation of the percentage rating for each defect or condition listed
on the AF Form 356.

A2.4. Effect of Disposition. Explain the effect the recommended disposition may have on the
member's military status. If the recommended disposition is permanent disability retirement or
placement on the TDRL, outline the benefits and privileges that go with retired status. If TDRL,
explain the legal requirement for periodic examinations as well as the possibility of final
disposition any time within the mandatory retention period on the TDRL. If the recommended
disposition is discharge, explain to the member that he or she will lose entitlement to Air Force
benefits upon termination of military status.

A2.5. Grade Determination. Generally, members retiring or separating for disability do so in
the grade in which they are serving on active duty. Members may be eligible to retire or separate
in a higher grade if they served satisfactorily in a higher grade, or are Regular Air Force enlisted
members or Reserve component officers holding a valid appointment in a higher ARC (USAF
Reserve) commissioned grade. The OSAF makes the grade determination, and HQ AFPC/DPPD
announces the decision in retirement orders or discharge notification message. length of
creditable service according to 10 U.S.C. 1208. AF Form 356, item 7, shows the length of
86                                                             AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006


service at the time the PEB considers the case. To be eligible for retirement for physical
disability, the member must have at least 20 years of service creditable for retirement or a
disability rating of 30 percent or more. A member whose compensable disability rating is less
than 30 percent and who has less than 20 years of creditable service will be entitled to discharge
with severance pay.

A2.6. Length of Service. One factor in determining entitlement to disability benefits is the
member's length of creditable service according to 10 U.S.C. 1208. AF Form 356, item 7, shows
the length of service at the time the PEB considers the case. To be eligible for retirement for
physical disability, the member must have at least 20 years of service creditable for retirement or
a disability rating of 30 percent or more. A member whose compensable disability rating is less
than 30 percent and who has less than 20 years of creditable service will be entitled to discharge
with severance pay.
A2.7. SAFPC Review. Advise members that, after completion of PEB action, HQ AFPC/DPPD
will refer the case to SAFPC for final review unless the Director, SAFPC, has authorized an
AFPC official to finalize the case under special assistant authority. The counselor also explains
that the Air Force Personnel Board within SAFPC may direct the final disposition in the case or
may change the PEB's findings and recommended disposition. If the change is major, HQ
AFPC/DPPD refers AFPB's revised recommended findings to the member for review and
comment (Section 5A, Chapter 5). The PEBLO or PEB counsel advises the member of his or
her legal rights, available options, and actions required.

A2.8. VA Benefits. Advise member of the right to apply to the VA for benefits. The counselor
will stress that the Air Force and the VA operate under different laws, and the decision of one
agency is not binding on the other. The PEBLO or PEB counsel advises members of the
following pertinent items:

       A2.8.1. VA Disability Compensation. Give the member an estimate of VA compensation
       if the VA were to rate the disability at the same percentage as the Air Force, but stress
       that this is only an estimate and not binding. Explain how the VA includes compensation
       for dependents when rating the disability at 30 percent or more and that the Air Force has
       no such legal authority (10 U.S.C., chapter 61, and 38 U.S.C. 314 and 315 (wartime) and
       38 U.S.C. 331, 334, and 335 (peacetime)). Advise each member that the MPF will give
       him or her the opportunity to file a claim for VA benefits during final out-processing. If
       the member elects not to apply for VA benefits, he or she must sign a statement
       acknowledging the opportunity to apply. The member may exclude from gross income
       either the amount of retired pay attributed to combat-related injuries or the amount of
       disability compensation the member could receive from the VA, whichever is greater.
       This is regardless of whether the member applies to the VA for such disability
       compensation. The tax laws do not require the Air Force to make a determination as to
       the probable VA disability compensation. The PEBLO tells members about this provision
       of law and gives them a rough estimate of the probable VA compensation.

       A2.8.2. Waiving Retired Pay for VA Compensation. Advise members they may waive all
       or part of retired pay to receive VA disability compensation. The part of the Air Force
       retired pay waived is equal to VA compensation received. If VA compensation equals or
AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006                                                                       87


       exceeds Air Force retired pay, the member must waive all Air Force retired pay. The
       member may revoke the waiver at any time to reestablish Air Force retired pay. This
       action has no effect on the right to waive Air Force retired pay again at a later date, if
       such action is a financial benefit.

       A2.8.3. Recouping Disability Severance Pay. The VA deducts the entire amount of Air
       Force disability severance pay from any VA compensation paid. At the discretion of the
       VA, the member may repay the entire amount in one lump sum, or the VA may withhold
       the monthly compensation until the total amount withheld equals the amount of the Air
       Force disability severance pay received.

       A2.8.4. Other VA Benefits. Counsel member on other VA benefits, such as post service
       life insurance, educational benefits, medical care, or hospitalization, but emphasize that
       approval of such benefits is at the discretion of the VA.

A2.9. Travel and Transportation. Advise members being retired or discharged for disability of
the travel and transportation entitlements in the JFTR, volume 1. Counseling should include the
following pertinent facts.

       A2.9.1. Home of Selection Move:
              A2.9.1.1. Injured or Ill Provision of the JFTR. The travel and transportation
              entitlements provided under this provision provide some different entitlements
              (for example, overland shipment of a privately owned vehicle, 18,000 pounds
              weight allowance regardless of grade, etc.) than those provided for members
              retired for disability or discharged with severance pay. The provision applies only
              in cases of prolonged hospitalization or treatment as verified by a statement of the
              commanding officer at the receiving hospital. The member must exercise these
              entitlements before retiring or separating. Failure to do so will not serve as a basis
              for requesting an extension of the disability retirement or separation date.

              A2.9.1.2. Retired. Members being retired for disability, regardless of years of
              service, may move dependents and household goods to a home of selection.
              Volume 1 of the JFTR shows the authorized weight allowances. Refer members
              to the local TMO for information and counseling on these entitlements. Advise
              them that failure to follow the instructions provided may result in liability for all
              or part of the cost of movements to a home of selection.

              A2.9.1.3. Discharged With Disability Severance Pay. Members discharged from
              active duty with disability severance pay who have completed at least 8 years of
              continuous active duty with no single break of more than 90 days have the same
              entitlement as members retired for disability.

       A2.9.2. Home of Record. Members being discharged from active duty, with or without
       disability severance pay, who do not qualify under paragraph A2.9.1.3. may move to
       home of record or place from which ordered to active duty.
88                                                            AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006


A2.10. Legal Rights. The PEBLO advises member that he or she has the legal right to a full and
fair hearing before being discharged or retired for physical disability. The counsel also advises
the member that appearance before a formal PEB constitutes a full and fair hearing as envisioned
by the law. Advise member that this legal right does not extend to members found fit and
recommended for return to duty. EXCEPTION: TDRL members found fit and recommended
for removal from TDRL.

A2.11. Pay Counseling. Upon receipt of findings and recommended disposition of the IPEB, the
PEBLO advises the member concerning entitlement to disability retired pay or disability
severance pay and gives the member the pay estimate provided by HQ AFPC/DPPDS. If the
FPEB changes the recommended disposition or compensable rating, the FPEB counsel revises
the pay estimate accordingly. The PEBLO also advises the NOK that DFAS-CL will not release
an incompetent member's retired pay to the NOK without trustee or legal guardianship
designation. The NOK obtains legal guardianship papers through the civilian courts at his or her
own expense. Obtain trusteeship designation through DFAS-CL.

A2.12. Estimated Pay. Advise all members that the discharge or retired pay estimate serves only
as information to consider in making the decision to agree or disagree with the PEB action. The
MPF furnishes additional information at the time of actual retirement or discharge; however, the
final authority for pay computations rests with DFAS-CL for retirements, or DFAS-DE or the
local finance office for disability severance pay (see paragraph 5.13.).

A2.13. Disability Retired Pay Computation. Retired pay computations are based either on a
percent of disability or percent for creditable service, whichever will result in a greater dollar
amount for the member.

       A2.13.1. Members in Service Before 8 September 1980.

               A2.13.1.1. To compute retired pay based on percent of disability, multiply the
               percent of disability (not to exceed 75 percent) by the current monthly basic pay
               rate of the retirement grade.

               A2.13.1.2. To calculate retired pay based on years of service, multiply the current
               monthly basic pay rate of the retirement grade by the retired pay multiplier.
               Calculate the retired pay multiplier by multiplying the computed value for years
               and months of creditable service times 2.5 percent. Derive computed value for
               months of creditable service by dividing the number of full months of completed
               service by 12. EXAMPLE: To compute the retired pay for a member with 15
               years and 7 months of creditable service take the following steps:

                      Step 1 - 7 mos divided by 12 = .583 of a year. (Round off to two decimal
                      places.)

                      Step 2 - Add .58 to 15 to get the computed value for years and months of
                      creditable service = 15.58 years.
AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006                                                                        89


                      Step 3 - Multiply 15.58 years by 2.5 percent (.025) = 38.95 percent.
                      (Retired pay multiplier).

                      Step 4 - Monthly basic pay rate for grade in which retired multiplied by
                      38.95 percent = retired pay based on years of service.

       A2.13.2. Members in Service After 7 September 1980. For members who entered a
       uniformed service after this date, apply the retired pay multiplier based on the percent of
       disability to the retired pay base (RPB) instead of the monthly basic pay rate. The RPB is
       an average of a member's highest 36 months of active duty pay. If the member served less
       than 36 months, the RPB is an average of pay for the months served. The formula for
       computing disability retired pay using years of service also applies. However, years of
       service is not a factor in retired pay computation for members retiring for disability until
       they acquire at least 12 years, 1 month of service. (A member with less than 20 years
       active service must have a disability rating of at least 30 percent to qualify for retirement.
       Twelve years of service equates to 30 percent.)

A2.14. Disability Severance Pay. Compute 2 months' basic pay for every year of active service
not to exceed 12 years or a maximum of 24 months' pay (Table 5.2.).

       A2.14.1. Rounding Out Service. Count as a whole year service of six months or more;
       disregard service of less than 6 months.

       A2.14.2. Less Than 6 Months Service. Advise members who have less than 6 months of
       active service that they will not receive any disability severance pay from the Air Force,
       as they have no active service to use as a multiplier.

A2.15. Tax Counseling. After advising member of the estimate of gross retired pay, the PEBLO
counsels members on how much of that pay may be subject to income tax and how much may be
exempt. The PEBLO should point out that, even though DFAS-CL determines the gross amount
of retired pay, the final authority on the amount of taxes owed is the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS). The Air Force has no control over IRS laws or rules. However, in counseling include the
following items so the member will have an idea of the amount of tax he or may have to pay.

       A2.15.1. Withholding Tax. Estimate the approximate amount of monthly withholding tax
       (see table in the "PEBLO Guide").

       A2.15.2. Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP). Explain that the member must decide whether to
       participate in the SBP, the desired level of participation, and that DFAS will exclude
       monthly SBP payments from gross retired pay subject to income tax. More information
       on the SBP is in AFI 36-3006, Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) and Supplemental Survivor
       Benefit Plan (SSBP)(Active, Guard, Reserve, and Retired).

       A2.15.3. Tax Exemption. Explain that the amount of retired pay based on percent of
       disability is tax free for those members who meet the tax exemption criteria in paragraph
       3.27. For those individuals, only the portion of retired pay based on years of service that
90                                                             AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006


       exceeds the amount based on disability is subject to income tax. If disability retired pay
       equals or is more than the amount based on service, retired pay is tax-free.

A2.16. Retired Pay While On TDRL. The retired pay of a TDRL member is the same as that of
a member permanently retired for disability. EXCEPTION: While on the TDRL, the member
will not receive less than 50 percent of the amount of monthly basic pay or RPB to which
entitled at time of retirement. Except for cost of living increases, a TDRL member's retired pay
will not change until removed from the list for permanent disposition. This is true even if the
percentage rating changes following periodic examination.

A2.17. The Tower Amendment. A save pay provision known as the Tower Amendment (10
U.S.C 1401a(f)) permits a member to use earlier active duty pay rates (cost of living adjusted), if
advantageous. The member must have been eligible to retire under nondisability provisions of
law when those earlier rates were in effect except that such computation may not be based on a
rate of basic pay for a grade higher than the grade in which the member is retired. Another
condition requires computation of pay using the grade held and years of service accrued at the
time those rates were in effect. When using the Tower Amendment, compute the portion of
disability retired pay based on percent of disability using the current basic pay rate only. This
portion may be tax free.

A2.18. Allotments From Retired Pay. The PEBLO advises member being retired for disability
that he or she must take action to continue, discontinue, change, or add allotments from retired
pay before the effective retirement date. Otherwise, the same allotments will continue provided
retired pay will cover them. All allotments from retired pay are subject to the rules, limitations,
and restrictions in DFAS-DE 177-373, volume 1.

A2.19. Creditable Service. HQ AFPC/DPPD provides the PEBLO with the length of service
used in computing disability retired pay at the same time that they send the PEB findings and
recommended disposition. However, the PEBLO must stress the following general items when
counseling the member:

       A2.19.1. Basic Pay. The length of service for basic pay sets the rate of basic pay. This
       service is not rounded off and the member must have at least 1 day over the required
       amount to use that particular rate of basic pay (37 U.S.C. 203, 204, 1009).

       A2.19.2. Multiplier. The service that determines the multiplier may include both active
       and inactive service. Computation for the multiplier generally falls into the following
       categories:

               A2.19.2.1. Enlisted Members. Service may include active, inactive, and certain
               “point” credit.

               A2.19.2.2. Officers. May include active, inactive, and certain constructive service
               with only "point" credit for inactive service after 1 June 1958.
AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006                                                                   91


              A2.19.2.3. ARC Members. Service may include active, inactive, and certain
              "point" credit.

A2.20. Retirement or Discharge Counseling:

       A2.20.1. The counseling outlined in this attachment does not take the place of the final
       retirement or separation counseling conducted by the member's MPF. This attachment is
       to aid the PEBLO in informing the member of all aspects of the disability evaluation
       system. The PEBLO must keep in close contact with the nearest servicing MPF for
       assistance in resolving related personnel actions. A2.20.2. In cases of sudden illness or
       imminent death, family members often need additional time to understand the effect of
       their decisions upon family well-being. The PEBLO refers the member (or NOK) to the
       MPF for counseling as soon as the member becomes terminally ill (see Chapter 2). This
       earlier personal affairs counseling by the MPF provides the family extra time to discuss
       and prepare for vital decisions they must make should the member be retired for physical
       disability. Counseling will include the following subjects: The difference in benefits
       payable when a terminally ill member dies on active duty versus in retirement;
       explanations of SBP options, Servicemen's Group Life Insurance (SGLI) and Veterans
       Group Life Insurance (VGLI) programs; private life insurance affected by retirement; and
       Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) cost
       sharing if the member is in a civilian hospital. Also explain to the member or NOK that a
       request for immediate retirement or separation could result in forfeiture of unused
       accrued leave days that they can not sell back to the government (see Chapter 5).

A2.21. How the Air Force Applies the VASRD. The Air Force uses the VASRD and
appropriate DoD guidance to determine the percentage of disability for each ratable defect or
condition shown on AF Form 356. The VASRD does not provide a specific rating for all
physical defects or conditions. Many of the general policies in the VASRD do not apply to the
military services, since they are primarily for the guidance of VA rating boards and often cover
laws and policies that apply only to the VA. Consequently, DoD has developed specific guidance
on general policy and certain ratable defects and conditions listed by VA diagnostic code
numbers (DoD Instruction 1332.39).
92                                                               AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006



                                   Attachment 3
                  PCS IN AWAITING ORDERS STATUS INSTRUCTIONS

I understand that if AFPC approves my request for "PCS in awaiting orders status":

     a. I will be entitled to pay and allowances during the period of PCS in awaiting orders
     status.

     b. The period spent on PCS in awaiting orders status is charged against any accrued leave,
     and any remaining time is an authorized absence.

     c. Transportation or travel allowances will be furnished if authorized for me, my
     dependents, and household goods, if I so desire (JFTR, volume 1).

     d. If I choose to receive transportation or travel allowances as indicated in paragraph c , I
     understand that:

       1. My entitlement to further transportation or travel allowances (to a home of selection)
       will be exhausted if I am discharged without severance pay. They will also be exhausted
       if I am discharged with severance pay before 8 years continuous duty (with no single
       break of more than 90 days).

       2. If I am discharged for physical disability with entitlement to severance pay and have
       completed at least 8 years of continuous active duty (with no single break of more than
       90 days) immediately before discharge, or, am retired by reasons of physical disability
       (permanent or temporary), I will be authorized additional transportation or travel
       allowances for my dependents and household goods, to a home of my selection.
       However, entitlement to additional transportation or travel allowances for my dependents
       and household goods may not exceed the entitlement from my last permanent duty station
       to home of selection, minus any transportation or travel allowances furnished or paid
       while PCS in awaiting orders status.

     e. If ordered to return to duty, I will be entitled to travel and transportation allowances for
     myself, my dependents, and household goods based on permanent change of station
     entitlements from the location of my awaiting orders to my new permanent duty station
     (including return to present duty station).

     f. If retirement or discharge is delayed or stopped for any reason, I remain subject to military
     control and subject to orders to a duty station, for duty, further medical treatment, and so on,
     as determined by the Air Force.

NOTE. Give a copy of this statement to each member who requests "PCS in awaiting orders
status." Counsel the member on the provisions of the JFTR that pertain to the transportation of
dependents and household goods.
AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006                                                                        93



                               Attachment 4
            RETIREMENT OR DISCHARGE DOCUMENTS AND REPORTS

A4.1. Immediately after receiving retirement orders or disposition instructions, the MPF prepares
the following required forms and documents to complete the disability processing.

       A4.1.1. DD Form 214, Certification of Release or Discharge from Active Duty.
       Prepare and distribute according to AFI 36-3203.

       A4.1.2. Retired Pay Documents. DD Form 2656, Data for Payment of Retired
       Personnel and other related documents. Send prepared documents to DFAS-CL/FR, as
       outlined in AFMAN 36-2622 and AFI 36-3006.

       A4.1.3. Character of Discharge. Except where otherwise shown below, members
       discharged for disability are honorably discharged and receive DD Form 256AF,
       Honorable Discharge.

              A4.1.3.1. Officer. An officer's service may be characterized as General (under
              honorable conditions) only when approved and directed within OSAF. In these
              cases, HQ AFPC/DPPD will specifically notify the servicing MPF of the approval.

              A4.1.3.2. Enlisted. Describe as "entry level," the separation of enlisted members
              in entry level status as defined in AFI 36-3208, unless OSAF specifically
              approves an honorable discharge. For the purpose of determining entry level
              character of service, consider the effective date of member's disability discharge
              as the date separation proceedings began. Characterize the service of enlisted
              members as General (under honorable conditions) when, based on the member's
              military record, a recommendation for such a discharge has been processed
              according to AFI 36-3208; or when directed by officials within OSAF. HQ
              AFPC/DPPD will notify the servicing MPF of OSAF approval.

       A4.1.4. DD Form 363AF, Certificate of Retirement. Give to all members retiring for
       disability (permanently, or placed on the TDRL) with enough creditable service to
       qualify for nondisability retirement. Prepare the certificate as outlined in AFI 36-3203
       and present in a Retirement Binder (National Stock Number 7510-00-134-8179) at a
       suitable ceremony. If the certificate or binder is not available, the MPF keeps the data
       needed to fill out the form and mails the item to the member's non-military address as
       soon as they are available.

       A4.1.5. DD Form 256AF. HQ AFPC/DPPD will prepare and mail a discharge certificate
       to members removed from the TDRL and discharged.

       A4.1.6. Certificate of Appreciation. AF Form 1344JA97 (for husbands and wives)
       Prepare and present as outlined in AFI 36-3203 to the spouse of a member retiring for
94                                                          AFI36-3212 2 FEBRUARY 2006


     disability (permanently or placed on TDRL) with enough creditable service to be eligible
     for non-disability retirement.

     A4.1.7. DD Form 2542, Certificate of Appreciation for Service in the Armed Forces
     of the United States. Prepare and present according to AFI 36-3203 to each member of
     the active and Reserve forces retiring for disability (permanently or placed on the TDRL)
     with enough creditable service to qualify for nondisability retirement.

     A4.1.8. Retirement Options or Entitlements Fact Sheet. Give this fact sheet (AFI 36-
     3203) to members retiring for disability at the same time you give them their retirement
     orders, or when they are undergoing retirement processing and counseling, whichever is
     earlier. The MPF advises members not to begin moving dependents or storing household
     goods before receiving their retirement orders, or until they know the order number and
     the fund citation. Before moving, members will contact the nearest military transportation
     officer for counseling on transportation entitlements.

     A4.1.9.Identification Cards. Issue or dispose of identification cards as shown in AFI 36-
     3001, Issuing and Controlling Identification (ID) Cards.

     A4.1.10. Special Information Report. Where deemed proper, the MPF reports special
     information required by AFI 71-101, Vol II, Criminal Investigations,
     Counterintelligence, and Protective Service Matters, at the time of final retirement or
     discharge processing.

                                    WAIVER STATEMENT

"I have been told that, based on findings of a Medical Board, I am not physically qualified for
retention in the military service. This disqualification is based on the finding of a physical defect
or condition considered to have existed before entry on my current duty status, and does not
appear to be incident to, or aggravated by, such duty. I have been told that I have a right to the
same processing as any other member of the Air Force being discharged by reason of physical
disability, including the consideration of my case by a Physical Evaluation Board. However, I
hereby waive this right. I understand that, as a result of signing this waiver statement, I will be
released from duty and returned to my home to await disposition under applicable USAFR or
ANG directives. I also understand that I will not be eligible to receive disability benefits from the
Air Force, but this waiver action does not stop me from applying for disability benefits
administered by the Department of Veterans' Affairs."




(Signature)                          (Date)


NOTE. If the member is a USAFR non-prior service enlisted person, add the following sentence
to the last paragraph of the waiver statement: "I also waive further processing under AFI 36-
3209."

separates individuals found unfit to perform the duties of their office or grade due to physical
disability. As the action agency within the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force (OSAF), the
