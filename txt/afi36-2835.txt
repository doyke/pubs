This Air Force Instruction (AFI) implements Air Force Policy Directive 36-28, Awards and
Decorations Programs, establishing annual award programs for outstanding performance in
acquisition excellence, acquisition leadership, contracting, and science and engineering. It
explains eligibility, nomination procedures and award selection criteria. Major commands
(MAJCOM), field operating agencies (FOA), direct reporting units (DRU), and Headquarters US
Air Force ensure all organizations have the opportunity to nominate eligible units and individuals
for awards as described in this instruction, forward nominees for competition at Air Force level,
and arrange local recognition. Awards are presented annually for achievements during the
previous year. Science and engineering awards are based on calendar year; acquisition
excellence, acquisition leadership, and contracting on a fiscal year basis (except where noted).
Selection panels may withhold an award due to lack of competition or when nominees’
achievements are not considered deserving of Air Force recognition. This instruction applies to
Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) Units and the Air National Guard (ANG). Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route
AF Form 847s from the field through the appropriate functional’s chain of command. This
publication may be supplemented at any level, but all direct Supplements must be routed to the
OPR of this publication for coordination prior to certification and approval. Ensure that all
records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records and disposed of in accordance with
the      Air     Force     Records        Disposition     Schedule      (RDS)       located     at

PRIVACY ACT WARNING STATEMENT

This Instruction requires maintaining information protected by the Privacy Act of 1974

Privacy Act systems of record notice F036 AF PC V, Awards and Decorations apply.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. AFI 36-2835, dated 16
July 2004, is superseded due to numerous content updates and deletions. Due to the shift in
acquisition    organizations     from      a    Wing/Group/Squadron      construct      to    a
Directorate/Division/Branch construct, the Acquisition Leadership Awards are realigned
accordingly. The Agile Acquisition Transformation Leadership Award is replaced by the
Acquisition Excellence Continuous Process Improvement Award. The number of Excellence in
Classified Contracting Larry Kabase Memorial Awards is increased in order to establish separate
categories for groups and individuals. The Systems and Research/Development categories
within the Outstanding Performance in a Source Selection Awards are combined into one. The
chapter on Value Engineering Awards is deleted. The Scientist/Engineer awards are combined
into one category. Two new awards for scientists and engineers are added: the Dr. Paul G.
Kaminski Most Promising Systems Engineer of the Year Award and the General Lester L. Lyles
Developmental Planning Engineer of the Year Award.

  4.2.1. Nominations. Each MAJCOM, FOA, DRU, and the ANG may only submit one
  nomination for each award category. The Scientist and Engineer Career Field Functional
  Manager (FM) and Career Field Manager (CFM) will evaluate the FOA and DRU
  submissions and select one nomination among them in each category for consideration at the
  Air Force level.
  4.2.2. Evaluation process. A board comprised of the voting members of the Scientist and
  Engineer Advisory Council (SEAC), or their designated representatives, will review and rate
  all packages for each award category. Evaluators will rate each nomination according to the
  overall impact to the AF mission, including operational impact, innovative improvements,
  and specific value provided to the customer. Given the wide spectrum of research and
  development activities eligible for recognition under the Scientist/Engineer award category,
  evaluators will broadly interpret ―operational impact‖ to include the potential of scientific
  discoveries or engineering advances to have future operational impact, as well as imminent
  or actual impact. Packages meeting the eligibility criteria will be rated according to the
  following point system:
     4.2.2.1. Operational Impact: 40 points. Examples of things that can be considered under
     this criterion include (list is not exhaustive):
         4.2.2.1.1. Development and/or implementation of new system(s) to satisfy emerging
         mission requirements for new/enhanced capabilities.
         4.2.2.1.2. Substantial improvement in Air Force processes, operational concepts, or
         force structure (e.g., improved use of resources or effectiveness through the
         application of scientific or analytical techniques).
         4.2.2.1.3. Substantial improvements in the operational effectiveness over the life
         cycle of the system(s) (e.g., increased mission capability or safety over the life cycle
         of the system(s)).
         4.2.2.1.4. Enhanced/increased performance (e.g., improving or exceeding the
         operational performance requirements or aiding operational effectiveness).
         4.2.2.1.5. Scientific discoveries or engineering advances that enable any of the
         above.
     4.2.2.2. Innovative Improvements: 40 points. Examples of things that can be considered
     under this criterion include (list is not exhaustive):

         4.2.2.2.2. Leading change.
         4.2.2.2.3. Scientific discoveries or engineering advances that enable any of the
         above.
     4.2.2.3. Customer Focus: 20 points. Examples of things that can be considered under
     this criterion include (list is not exhaustive):

recognizes personnel who make outstanding contributions to the United States Air Force in the
area of Systems Engineering within the construct of the acquisition process. The General Lester
L. Lyles Developmental Planning Engineer of the Year Award is named for the former
Commander, Air Force Materiel Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, and
recognizes personnel working in the area of Developmental Planning or pre-acquisition concept
development who have made significant contributions to the Air Force. These awards are
presented to members of the Air Force’s professional workforce who have at least a Bachelor of
Science degree in a Science, Technology, Engineering or Mathematics (STEM) field, and who
contribute to the Air Force’s continuing advancement in capabilities critical to executing its
mission in air, space, and cyberspace (i.e., this is not functional, AFSC, or occupational series-
specific; it is open to Air Force personnel in other career fields). Further eligibility criteria for
each category are shown in Table 4.2.
