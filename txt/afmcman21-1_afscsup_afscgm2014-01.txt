AFMCMAN21-1_AFSCSUP_AFSCGM2014-01, AIR FORCE SUSTAINMENT CENTER
GUIDANCE SUPPLEMENTING AFMCMAN 21-1, AIR FORCE MATERIEL
COMMAND TECHNICAL ORDER SYSTEM PROCEDURES


1. General: This GM enhances the AFSC implementation of AFMCMAN 21-1, by defining
   the relationship between AFMC Form 202 work stoppage assignment and maintenance
   critical path management. The scope of this GM applies to all AFSC organic depot Aircraft
   Maintenance Groups (AMXGs). All other depot production groups (PMXG, CMXG,
   EMXG, MMXG, SMXG, etc.) are not affected by this GM until additional specific guidance
   is developed.

2. Procedure:
   2.1. All ALC organic depot Aircraft Maintenance Groups shall define and implement
        processes at key organizational levels that ensure their AFMC Form 202 requests are
        properly prioritized and referenced to planned critical path maintenance. For all AFMC
        Forms 202 generated within the Aircraft Maintenance Groups, the following
        requirements shall be addressed:
        2.1.1. An AFMC Form 202 shall only be requested as work stoppage in block 11 when
               the need date for the complete technical resolution is expected to impact the
               planned maintenance critical path of the aircraft within five working days.
        2.1.2. For AFMC Forms 202, the initiating organization shall identify the appropriate
               target need date in block 14. The target date will be based on the planned
               maintenance critical path of the aircraft.
        2.1.3. Aircraft Maintenance Groups will work with partners to establish a process to
               communicate priorities for open AFMC Forms 202.
