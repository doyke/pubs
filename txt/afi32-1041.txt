This instruction implements AFPD 32-10, Installations and Facilities. It outlines responsibilities,
requirements, and procedures for requesting, conducting, and reporting results of pavement
structural evaluations; friction characteristics evaluations; Pavement Condition Index (PCI)
surveys; power check pad anchor tests; and roughness surveys. It also outlines the procedures for
determining the need for runway rubber removal and provides guidance and criteria for airfield
pavement Engineering Assessments (EA) and asset management. Use this guidance in the United
States (U.S.) and U.S. territories in conjunction with applicable Federal, state, and local laws and
regulations. Although evaluation procedures follow the same methods anywhere in the world, for
installations outside the United States and its territories, compliance requirements within the
Overseas Environmental Baseline Guidance Document (OEBGD) or the final governing standard
(FGS) for the host country take precedence over this document. Ensure that all records created as
a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force
Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air
Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in the Air Force Records Information
Management System (AFRIMS). Send comments and suggested improvements on Air Force
(AF) Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, through major commands
(MAJCOM) to the Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC), 139 Barnes Drive, Suite 1,
Tyndall AFB, FL 324035319. The use of the name or mark of any specific manufacturer,
commercial product, commodity, or service in this publication does not imply endorsement by

                                           OVERVIEW

1.1. Purpose of the Program. The Air Force Pavement Evaluation Program obtains, compiles,
and reports pavement strength, condition, and performance data, including data on structural,
friction, roughness, and anchor capability on all airfields with present or potential Air Force
missions. Pavement evaluation data give civil engineers the information they need to actively
manage base and airfield pavement systems, as well as providing operators the information they
need to manage and control the airfield. They use the results of pavement evaluation studies to:
     1.1.1. Determine the size, type, gear configuration, number of passes, and weight of aircraft
     that can safely operate from an airfield without damaging the pavement or the aircraft.
     1.1.2. Develop or adjust operations usage patterns for a particular aircraft pavement system
     (for example, parking, apron use patterns, and taxiway routing).
     1.1.3. Project or identify major maintenance or repair requirements for an airfield pavement
     system to support present or proposed aircraft missions. Structural evaluations provide
     engineering data used in pavement EAs and asset management and are a good reference aid
     for designing projects.
     1.1.4. Develop and maintain airfield layout and physical property data to the section level to
     assist airbase mission and contingency planning functions and provide information for
     validation of real property records.
     1.1.5. Develop and confirm design criteria.
     1.1.6. Develop and justify major pavement projects and maintenance and repair (M&R)
     plans.
     1.1.7. Enhance flight safety by implementing recommendations from friction and roughness
     characteristics reports, when applicable.
     1.1.8. Verify that power check pad anchors can safely support aircraft engine maintenance.
1.2. Program Elements. The Air Force Pavement Evaluation Program consists of several
elements:
     1.2.1. Airfield pavement structural evaluations.
     1.2.2. Runway surface effects evaluations (friction characteristics and runway roughness).
     1.2.3. PCI surveys for airfields and road networks.
     1.2.4. Power check pad (trim pad) anchor tests.
     1.2.5. Pavement EAs.
     1.2.6. Asset management.
AFI32-1041 10 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                     7


1.3. Types of Evaluations:
   1.3.1. Airfield Pavement Structural Evaluation: Determines a pavement's load-carrying
   capability for various aircraft by testing the physical properties of the pavement system in its
   current condition.
   1.3.2. Runway Friction Characteristics Evaluation: Determines the hydroplaning
   potential of a runway surface under standardized wet conditions.
   1.3.3. PCI Survey: Identifies and documents pavement distresses caused by aircraft
   loadings, vehicle traffic, and environmental conditions. Base and command personnel use
   these data to:
       1.3.3.1. Determine the operational condition of pavements;
       1.3.3.2. Develop and prioritize sustainment, repair and restoration/modernization
       projects;
       1.3.3.3. Determine whether an airfield structural pavement evaluation is needed;
       1.3.3.4. Perform EAs;
       1.3.3.5. And manage assets.
   1.3.4. Power Check Pad Anchor Test: Uses specialized equipment and procedures to
   determine the capability of anchors to support aircraft engine tests.
   1.3.5. Engineering Assessments: EAs are analyses currently provided as part of PCI
   surveys that combine data from the PCI survey, structural evaluation and friction evaluation
   and are conducted to prioritize pavement O&M projects.
1.4. Asset Management. An Activity Management Plan (AMP) is prepared to determine the
funding required to maintain essential infrastructure. AMPs include information on Real
Property inventory, Levels of Service (LOS), Key Performance Indicators (KPI), and the planned
investments (projects/requirements) identified to achieve the required LOS (see Chapter 9).

                      LINEAR SEGMENTATION OF PAVEMENTS

3.1. Department of Defense (DOD) Linear Segmentation Guidance. Recent efforts by the
DOD to better manage infrastructure assets resulted in the publication of new guidance on Real
Property Inventory Requirements and linear segmentation of the assets. This guidance can be
found at http://www.acq.osd.mil/ie/bei/library.shtml#rpir. It establishes a framework for a
transformed real property accountability business process, and establishes data standards
required to manage real property assets throughout their life cycle. This AFI provides guidelines
for linear segmentation of both airfield and roadway pavements to supplement DOD guidance
and provides a common framework that enables pavement evaluation data to be shared with real
property, asset management, and geospatial information systems. This integration allows these
systems to use the data generated by recurring pavement evaluations as an authoritative source of
pavements inventory and condition data for the systems of record. The Linear Segmentation
Playbook available at https://cs.eis.af.mil/a7cportal/CEPlaybooks/OPS/LI/default.aspx
provides a supplement to this AFI.
   3.1.1. To achieve OSD linear segmentation objectives, data elements outlined in the OSD
   Real Property Information Data Model Version 5.0 used in real property systems, are
   assigned to linear segmentation data elements used in pavements management. The key field
   of importance is the Real Property Unique ID (RPUID) which is linked to each section,
   although other fields are linked as well, including the Real Property Network, Real Property
   Site Unique Identifier (RPSUID), Facility Number, Facility Analysis Category (FAC), and
   Category Code (CATCODE). Following is a description of these data elements.
       3.1.1.1. Real Property Network. The Real Property Network groups assets based on
       the common service or commodity provided, such as an airfield pavement system or
       road, street, and parking area system. This concept aligns well with the network concept
       used in the pavement community. The primary criteria for a network is that is can have
       only one Real Property Site Unique Identifier (RPSUID). In addition, a network may be
       established for other reasons. For example, even though they have the same RPSUID as
       the main base, the roads and parking in base housing may be a separate network,
       especially if they have been privatized. Real property records, privatization agreements,
       or survey data will be important in determining where exact break points are when
       transitioning from one network to another. Following are some examples of networks
       that will be established:
       - Airfield network for main base
       - Paved road, drive and parking network for main base
       - Unpaved road, drive and parking network for main base
        -Airfield network for auxiliary fields or landing zones
       - Paved road, drive and parking network for auxiliary fields or GSUs
       - Unpaved road, drive and parking network for auxiliary fields/ranges
       - Paved road, drive and parking network for housing
       3.1.1.2. RPSUID. The RPSUID is a unique number that is assigned to each site by
       OSD. In most cases this will equate to an installation.
AFI32-1041 10 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                    11


       3.1.1.3. RPUID. The RPUID is a non-intelligent code assigned by OSD used to
       permanently and uniquely identify a real property asset. Note that there is a one-to-one
       relationship between the RPUID and the facility number.
       3.1.1.4. Facility Number. AFI 32-9005, Real Property Accountability and Reporting,
       paragraph A9.8 requires that all facilities located on or under control of the installation,
       including privately owned, have a unique facility number assigned by the Real Property
       Officer.
       3.1.1.5. FAC. The FAC is an OSD level designator that represents the current use by the
       assigned user of a specific portion of the real property asset. For example FAC 1111
       identifies a runway.
       3.1.1.6. CATCODE. The CATCODE is a Military Service designator that represents
       the current use by the assigned user of a specific portion of a real property asset. Each
       FAC has one or more CATCODES assigned to it. For example CATCODE 111111 is
       the Air Force CATCODE for runways. Note that CATCODES are not the same among
       the services. A pavements facility can have only one CATCODE.
3.2. Pavement Management Segmentation. For many years, engineers have segmented
pavement systems into basic units, designating pavements with common characteristics as
networks, branches, and sections. Figure 3.2 shows the accepted schema for naming segments
on an airfield and Figure 3.3 shows the schema for roads and parking areas. Unified Facilities
Criteria (UFC) 3-260-01, Airfield and Heliport Planning and Design; UFC 3-260-02, Pavement
Design for Airfields; and UFC 3-260-03, Airfield Pavement Evaluation; also provide information
on segmentation and procedures for identifying branches and sections of airfield pavements for
both PCI and structural pavement evaluations.
   3.2.1. Network. A network is typically characterized as all pavements with a similar
   function, such as all airfield pavements or all roads and parking areas on a base. This
   construct aligns well with the Real Property definition of a network as described above.
   Networks are further subdivided into branches that are a logical subset of the network.
   3.2.2. Branch. A branch is a subset of the network such as a runway, a named taxiway or an
   apron for an airfield, or a named road or parking area. Branches are subdivided into sections
   that are a subset of the branch with specific physical or usage characteristics.
   3.2.3. Section. A section is a subset of a branch and is assigned based on characteristics
   such as pavement type, use, structure, construction history, traffic area, rank, or condition.
   Some of these characteristics, such as traffic area, are just applicable to airfields, while
   others, such as pavement type apply to both airfields and roads.
       3.2.3.1. Pavement Type. There are several pavement types: flexible, rigid, rigid or
       flexible overlay on rigid, flexible overlay on flexible, composite, and reinforced rigid, as
       well as unsurfaced. A specific section contains only one pavement type.
       3.2.3.2. Pavement Use. Airfield pavements consist of runways, taxiways, aprons,
       overruns and shoulders. The pavements not associated with the airfield on a base consist
       of roads, parking areas, and driveways. A section typically has a single pavement use.
       3.2.3.3. Pavement Structure. The thickness and strength of the pavement and soil
       layers usually vary considerably throughout an airfield or road and parking system;
 12                                                         AFI32-1041 10 SEPTEMBER 2013


       however, each discrete pavement section must have relatively uniform cross-sectional
       properties to represent the section.
       3.2.3.4. Construction History. In most cases, pavements are constructed using different
       materials and techniques on various portions of the airfield or base at different times. All
       pavements included in a specific section have a consistent construction history.
       3.2.3.5. Pavement Rank. Pavement sections are assigned a rank; Primary, Secondary,
       Tertiary, or Unused to help define the importance of the structure in the asset
       management system as described in paragraph 9.3.1. When a portion of a branch contains
       pavements with more than one rank, establish sections within the branch according to the
       rank.
       3.2.3.6. Traffic Areas. Airfield pavements are divided into traffic areas based on the
       lateral distribution of aircraft traffic and effective gross aircraft load. These areas are
       designated types A, B, C, and D. A section typically has a single traffic area designation
       e.g. A01B has a B traffic area. Further details regarding traffic area segmentation rules
       are provided in paragraph 3.6.
       3.2.3.7. Pavement Condition. Each pavement section has consistent characteristics as
       addressed in paragraphs 3.2.3.1 through 3.2.3.6. Sometimes the condition of the
       pavement in an area varies considerably. In this situation, the discrete pavement area can
       be subdivided into separate pavement sections based on the surface condition of the
       pavement. See paragraph 3.6.4 for details on creating sections based on condition.
3.3. Correlation of Real Property and Engineering Pavement Linear Segmentation
Data. The general hierarchy for integrating pavements real property and engineering data is
network, facility, branch, and section. Ideally, there should be a one-to-many relationship
between each of these entities as you proceed down the hierarchy (See Figure 3.1 below).
However, initial efforts to correlate segmentation data elements (branches and sections) used in
pavements management with real property pavement facilities highlighted several issues that
may need to be addressed when implementing linear segmentation guidance at a specific
location. The primary impact of these issues is that there will likely be instances where the
hierarchy shown in Figure 3.1 cannot be maintained without compromising the ability to manage
the asset from an engineering perspective. A primary example is having to divide a single
branch into multiple branches preventing analysis of that branch as a single entity (for example,
will not be able to calculate the weighted area condition for a named taxiway within PAVER).
In instances where the pavements have the same category code, the Real Property Officer may be
able to consolidate the multiple facilities into one, resolving the issue. If asset depreciation or
other issues prevent this and the facility cannot be modified, the hierarchy may be disregarded to
maintain the integrity of the branch.
   3.3.1. Pavement Facilities and Category Codes: In pavement terms, a facility is an area of
   pavement with a specific function such as a runway, apron, taxiway, overrun, shoulder,
   roadway(s), or parking area(s). In real property terms the definition of a linear facility is
   more restrictive. Currently the primary constraint for creating a linear facility is that
   category codes cannot be mixed. For example, overruns (category code 111115) cannot be
   combined in a facility with the main load bearing surface of the runway (category code
   111111). The facility is not only tied to the category code, but may also be tied to other
   characteristics such as when it was originally constructed.
AFI32-1041 10 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                     13


Figure 3.1. Segmentation Hierarchy.




   3.3.2. Creation/Designation of Pavement Facilities Varies from Base to Base; Real
   Property guidance requires a real property record be prepared for each real property asset. In
   practice, bases have implemented theses rules in many different ways. Pavement assets are
   assigned facility numbers separately or in the aggregate, according to command or base
   determination. Each base will have a pavement facility map that shows the geospatial
   extents of each pavement facility in its real property records. If the base does not have one, it
   must         create      it.             The        Linear        Segmentation        playbook,
   https://cs.eis.af.mil/a7cportal/CEPlaybooks/OPS/LI/default.aspx provides additional
   information on creating pavement facility maps. The intent of the playbook is to provide
   standard guidance for creating pavement facilities to reduce the variability from base to base
   outlined below whenever updates/changes are required. In general, the following situations
   exist in the field;
      3.3.2.1. Runways. Typically each runway at a base has its own facility number and the
      overruns for the runway have a separate facility number. There are instances where
      runway shoulders have a separate facility as well, but most bases have included all
      shoulders for runways, aprons, and taxiways in one facility.
      3.3.2.2. Taxiways. In terms of real property records, some bases have included all
      taxiways in one facility, some bases have created a facility for each named taxiway (a
      taxiway with an alpha designation), and other bases have included multiple named
      taxiways in multiple facilities. Additionally, while it poses significant issues from a
      pavement asset data management perspective, some bases have created a facility for
 14                                                         AFI32-1041 10 SEPTEMBER 2013


      concrete taxiways and one for asphalt taxiways. As with runways, some bases have
      combined all shoulders into one facility number while other bases have taxiway shoulders
      in a separate facility.
      3.3.2.3. Aprons. As with taxiways, there is variability from base to base in the
      designation of apron facilities. Some bases have all aprons with a specific category code
      (even if they are not contiguous) included in a single facility for that category code, other
      bases have each contiguous apron documented as a separate facility, and others have a
      combination of the two. Finally, as with taxiways, some bases have created a facility
      number for all concrete aprons and one for all asphalt aprons.
      3.3.2.4. Roads, Streets and Access Roads. The term road is typically intended to mean
      highways, roads, and streets. While ideally, each named road would be managed as a
      separate facility for real property inventory and programming purposes, as will airfields,
      there is variability with the way bases have implemented the rules for designating road
      and parking facilities. Some bases have assigned all surfaced roads (CATCODE 851147)
      in one facility, others have created a separate facility for all concrete roads and one for all
      asphalt roads, but most bases have some other variation in which there are multiple road
      facilities for paved roads and multiple road facilities for unpaved roads. In addition, any
      access road not associated with a parking area that provides access to a building (for
      example, the road that goes to the front entrance of the Wing Headquarters building
      should be considered part of the road facility. Unsurfaced roads (CATCODE 852101)
      are handled in a manner similar to paved roads. The installation may have all unsurfaced
      roads in a separate facility or may have documented multiple facilities to capitalize
      unsurfaced roads.
      3.3.2.5. Driveways. The term driveway has been used to refer to access roads for
      buildings or parking areas as well as pavements serving a residence. The current AF real
      property definition of a driveway (CATCODE 851145) is a private road leading from a
      street or other thoroughfare to a building, house, or garage. It is normally a hard surfaced
      road constructed of concrete or asphalt. UFC 3-250-01FA, Design of Roads Streets,
      Walks and Parking Areas and UFC 3-250-18FA, Geometric Design for Roads Streets
      and Walks clearly intends for the term driveway to be associated with a residence in the
      housing area. While bases have assigned this category code to other pavements, current
      guidance dictates it be reserved for driveways in housing. As with roads, bases may have
      assigned all surfaced driveways to one facility, created a separate facility for all concrete
      driveways and one for any asphalt driveways, or some other variation.
      3.3.2.6. Parking Areas. Parking areas include both the parking area itself and the access
      roads that serve it. Some bases have assigned all parking areas for a given category code
      in a single facility. There are currently six different category codes for surfaced and
      unsurfaced parking areas which would equate to six facilities. Most bases have multiple
      pavement facilities for each CATCODE and in practice, there is a great deal of variation
      in how bases determine which parking areas to include in a specific facility. The main
      rule of thumb is that parking areas with different category codes cannot be included in the
      same facility.
3.4. Assigning Branches and to Facilities. Because of the variation described above, the
pavement facility map plays a crucial role in correlating engineering pavement segments
AFI32-1041 10 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                    15


(branches and sections) to pavement facilities. To start the correlation process, obtain the
pavement facility map depicting the location of each pavement facility on the base from the base
GeoBase office. As mentioned previously, if the base does not have this map, it must be created.
Without this map, it will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to correlate engineering
segments to real property pavement facilities. The map should clearly show the geospatial extent
of each pavement facility listed in the real property record. It will include all paved and unpaved
airfield, road, driveway, and parking surfaces.
   3.4.1. During initial efforts to align branches and sections from the pavement management
   system with facilities in the real property system, branches and sections used in past
   pavement evaluations may need to be modified to align with the facility/branch hierarchy and
   to ensure the boundaries of the branches and sections align properly with the facilities.
   3.4.2. When problems or discrepancies are identified, such as inability to maintain facility
   branch hierarchy, incorrect facility boundaries, or erroneous category codes, discuss the issue
   with the base pavement engineer, real property officer and the GeoBase office and make
   needed changes to real property facility numbers and the pavement facility map outlined in
   the Pavement Linear Segmentation Playbook.
   3.4.3. The real property data elements identified in section 3.1 are included as user defined
   fields in PAVER 6.5.2 using a database template. In PAVER 7.0, the real property data
   elements are integral to the PAVER data schema so pavements management data and real
   property facility data can be correlated. The real property data elements are assigned at the
   section level to provide maximum flexibility and the ability to adjust to future changes.
   PAVER and the Pavement Computer Aided Structural Engineering (PCASE) program share
   inventory, meaning that PCASE uses the same branch and section structure as PAVER and
   data for a given base can be stored in a common database for use by both programs.
   3.4.4. Earlier versions of PAVER and PAVER-PCASE 7.0 have a GIS capability which
   allows the user to import a shape file and create associations between the branches and
   sections in the inventory and the polygons on the map that define the geospatial extent of the
   branches and sections. Creating these relationships using PAVER-PCASE ensures
   adherence to all business rules.
   3.4.5. Once a relationship is created between facilities, branches, and sections, the area and
   condition data in PAVER, as well as the structural capacity data generated by PCASE, can be
   shared with real property, asset management, and geospatial information systems. The
   primary key used to exchange data between PAVER-PCASE and these other systems is the
   RPUID.
3.5. Branch Level Airfield Pavement Segmentation Rules. Ideally, a branch may be assigned
to only one facility and a section may be assigned to only one branch. A branch will be given
both a branch name and a branch unique ID in PAVER-PCASE. As noted previously, there are
instances where the manner in which facilities are designated creates issues for pavement
management. In general, if a branch has multiple facility numbers assigned, the RPO, base
pavement engineer, and GeoBase office should work together to resolve the issue. If it cannot be
resolved, maintain the integrity of the branch. Following are some general guidelines for
assigning branches to facilities.
 16                                                         AFI32-1041 10 SEPTEMBER 2013


   3.5.1. Runways. The load bearing surface of each runway is typically a branch. Assign that
   branch to the facility for that runway. The overruns for a runway will constitute one branch.
   Assign the overrun branch to the overrun facility for that runway. The shoulders for each
   runway are typically a branch (RWSHOULDER). Assign that branch to the appropriate
   shoulder facility whether all shoulders are one facility or there is a separate facility for
   runway shoulders.
   3.5.2. Taxiways. For linear segmentation and evaluation purposes, a taxiway will be
   defined as one with an alphanumeric designation (e.g. Taxiway A, Taxiway A1). The
   distinction is discussed further in paragraph 3.6.7. In pavement management, the load
   bearing surface of each named (with an alphanumeric designation) taxiway is typically a
   branch. If the taxiway has a shredout (e.g. Taxiway A1) include it in the branch with the
   same alpha designation; in this this example, Taxiway A. Assign these branches to the
   appropriate facility number per the pavement facility map. The shoulders for taxiways are
   also given a branch designation (TWSHOULDER). Assign that branch to the appropriate
   shoulder facility, whether all shoulders are one facility or there is a separate facility for
   taxiway shoulders.
   3.5.3. Aprons. Aprons are more of a challenge than runways and taxiways. There are ten
   different category codes for various types of aprons. In general, aprons can be divided into
   two types; those used to park aircraft, such as a main parking apron or dispersed parking
   pads, and those used for short-term parking, such as an arm/disarm pad or for support
   equipment. There is one category code for aircraft parking aprons and nine for other aprons
   used by aircraft and support equipment. Main parking aprons or dispersed parking pads
   (CATCODE 113321) will have an AP prefix in the branch name (e.g. APMAIN) and all
   other aprons/pads will have an OA prefix in the branch name (e.g. OAHOTCARGO).
       3.5.3.1. Divide each contiguous main apron into separate branches based on operational
       use. For example, a portion of the apron is used for the primary mission aircraft and a
       portion is used for transient aircraft or an Air National Guard or Reserve mission. These
       branches will be assigned to the appropriate facility as required.
       3.5.3.2. Dispersed parking aprons are typically grouped into a single branch. For
       instance, all parking pads on the loop taxiway would be in the branch APLOOP. If each
       of the individual pads has been assigned a facility number, creating a separate branch for
       each of these facilities significantly complicates analysis. In these instances, disregard
       the hierarchy and create the branch as described above.
       3.5.3.3. For other aprons, use the category code as the guide for creating branches. For
       example, all arm/disarm pads (CATCODE 116661) on an airfield, even though they are
       not contiguous, will be included in a branch. Create a separate branch for compass
       calibration pads, power check pads, dangerous cargo pads, etc.
       3.5.3.4. The shoulders for all aprons will be assigned to a branch. Shoulder branches
       will be assigned to the appropriate facility. Assign that branch to the appropriate
       shoulder facility whether all shoulders are one facility or there is a separate facility for
       apron shoulders.
3.6. Airfield Pavement Segmentation Rules. In addition to the branch level rules outlined

Playbook; https://cs.eis.af.mil/a7cportal/CEPlaybooks/OPS/LI/default.aspx            gives   some
specific examples to supplement the information provided below.
   3.6.1. Airfield Section Naming Conventions. Figure 3.2 below provides an overview of the
   rules and codes for designating sections. Each airfield section for a specific network has a
   unique number assigned. For instance, section R01A1 identifies the keel section of the first
   thousand feet on a given runway. That section number is not used anywhere else on that
   airfield.
   3.6.2. As new sections are created and old ones deleted, over time the section numbering on
   a base can become complicated. In the past, teams would completely re-number the
   sectioning on a base to follow a pattern and make it easier to locate sections. While
   renumbering the whole airfield or road network does make locating sections easier, it
   presents other issues with continuity. Do not completely re-number pavement sections just to
   “clean up” the drawing as part of an evaluation. If a new section is created, give it the next
   consecutive number available or shredout the section if it is structurally the same as the
   parent section (for example, A10B would be shred out into A10B1 and A10B2). The benefit
   of each section having the same number over time outweighs the inconvenience. This is
   especially true when trying to correlate pavement management data with real property and
   asset management systems.
   3.6.3. Do not re-use section numbers if the entire section is demolished. Delete the section
   number in the physical property data (PPD) sheet, but retain it in the construction history
   with a note that it was demolished. Due to inconsistent application of these rules in the past,
   there may be gaps in section numbering, but no clear indication of why these numbers are no
   longer used. If the omitted section numbers are verified as not being used in past evaluation
   reports, the numbers may be used. Once a number is assigned, do not use it again.
   3.6.4. Each pavement section must have relatively uniform cross-sectional properties.
   Sections can be created with shredouts if they are structurally the same but have a different
   rank or significantly different PCI. The primary purpose for this business rule is to allow
   pavement evaluation teams and other users to quickly identify pavements with similar
   structures on a map and to increase the efficiency of testing. Sections with shredouts will be
   consolidated when performing coring, dynamic cone penetrometer, and heavyweight
   deflectometer (HWD) testing.
      3.6.4.1. Do not shred out a section that has different physical characteristics. If a portion
      of a section is reconstructed and is now structurally different, the new portion should get
      a new section number. For example, a portion of an asphalt ladder taxiway section,
      T14C, is reconstructed with concrete as part of a runway military construction
      (MILCON) project. The new section should be given the next consecutive unassigned
      section number rather than dividing the section into T14C1 and T14C2.
      3.6.4.2. A pavement that is milled and overlaid with the same thickness of asphalt that
      was in the original section would be considered structurally similar and could be given a
      shredout unless heavyweight deflectometer testing indicates otherwise.

Figure 3.2. Airfield Segmentation Schema.




   3.6.5. Runways. The keel section of the runway sees a much higher volume of traffic than
   the outer portions and therefore will usually have a different PCI deterioration rate. To
   address this issue, designate the keel section of the runway as a section separate from the
   outer portions. The keel section will be given a shred out (e.g. R01A1) and the outer
   (noncontiguous) portions of the runway will be given a shred out (e.g. R01A2). The R01A
   designation indicates that both sections have similar construction and the shredout indicates
   the sections have another characteristic that warrants they be separated, such as rank or in
   this case, PCI.
   3.6.6. Overruns. Overruns and the outside portion of some runways are designed using a D
   traffic area. For evaluation purposes, overruns are typically evaluated with a C traffic area if
   evaluated for load bearing capacity with the exception of section 3.6.6.1 below. The primary
   reason for this is that evaluating an overrun with a D traffic area results in high allowable
   gross loads (AGLs) and a pavement classification number (PCN) that may be misleading to
   those using the report. Typically, an overrun will have a tertiary rank unless there is an
   aircraft arresting system present.
      3.6.6.1. Overruns can be constructed with a Type A traffic area to increase the takeoff
      length for mission aircraft. In these instances, the pavement should be marked with a
      displaced threshold (per ETL 04-2) and classified (CATCODE) as a runway rather than
      an overrun. The section will have an R designation, be given an A traffic area, and it will
      be indentified as a primary pavement. Overruns on unsurfaced landing zones are always
      evaluated as A traffic.
AFI32-1041 10 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                   19


     3.6.6.2. If it is marked as a runway with a displaced threshold but is included in an
     overrun facility, identify the issue to the base to update the current use (CATCODE). If
     the CATCODE is correct, label it as an overrun with an A traffic area and give it a
     primary rank.
  3.6.7. Taxiways, Access Taxiways, and Taxilanes. While the term taxiway is often used
  for all three of these entities, they are each defined slightly differently and are treated
  differently. See UFC 3-260-01, Airfield and Heliport Planning and Design, and UFC 3-260-
  02, Pavement Design for Airfields for specific definitions.
     3.6.7.1. For linear segmentation and evaluation purposes a taxiway is defined as having
     an alphanumeric designation (e.g. Taxiway A, Taxiway A1 or East Loop Taxiway). If a
     named taxiway passes through an apron, it is considered a separate branch/section than
     the apron pavement. As shown in Figure 3.2, a taxiway will have a T designation. A
     primary taxiway will have an A traffic area, while ladder taxiways or taxiways that only
     have a low volume of traffic will typically have a C traffic area.
     3.6.7.2. A taxilane on an apron will not typically have an alpha designation. It may or
     may not have the same representative thickness as the apron but is considered part of the
     apron in either case. If the taxilane has a different structure than the surrounding apron
     pavement, it must be subdivided into a separate section of the apron branch and will have
     an A designation and the same traffic area as the surrounding apron; typically B type
     traffic for a main apron or C for a hangar access apron.
     3.6.7.3. Access taxiways do not have an alphanumeric designation and as the name
     implies, provide access to a main or hangar access apron, pad, or washrack, etc.
     Historically, access taxiways have been given either A or T designations and may have
     A, B, or C traffic areas. In an effort to standardize, many past designations will need to
     be updated. Do not create a separate section for an access taxiway if it is the same
     construction as the apron or pad that it is accessing. If the construction is different, make
     it a separate section and give it a T designation. Note that even though it has a T
     designation, it will be considered part of the apron facility and branch and will have the
     appropriate apron CATCODE. It will have the same traffic area as the apron or pad to
     which it provides access. This will typically be either B or C traffic as outlined in UFC
     3-260-02, Figures 3-1 thru 3-3.
  3.6.8. Shoulders. Shoulders are typically designed to support vehicle traffic and are not
  given a traffic area in design. AFCEC does not evaluate the structural capability of shoulders
  as part of an evaluation unless the MAJCOM specifically requests it. Shoulder pavement is
  given a D traffic type in the inventory should it need to be evaluated in the future.
  3.6.9. Random Slab Replacement and Minor Asphalt Repairs. Do not subdivide sections
  that have randomly replaced slabs, have asphalt patches or small areas where the asphalt has
  been replaced. Generally, a section should only be subdivided when it is a large section and
  the replaced pavement is contiguous and comprises 25 percent or more of the existing
  section. Determining what constitutes a large section and when to break out a section
  involves engineering judgment. The intent is not to break out sections unless it has a
  significant impact to the outcome of the evaluation or the ability of the base to manage their
  pavement.
 20                                                         AFI32-1041 10 SEPTEMBER 2013


   3.6.10. Pavement Rank. Sections may be created to differentiate between the relative
   importance of the pavement to the mission. Consider a situation where the main apron was
   built at one time with similar construction throughout and is assigned a facility number.
   Assume the facility has one branch (APMAIN). Currently a portion of the apron supports the
   assigned flying mission, but half the apron is only used occasionally for air shows or
   overflow transient aircraft. The portion of the apron that supports the active mission is
   primary and the remaining apron is tertiary. Divide the apron into two sections (A01B1
   primary and A01B2 tertiary for example). That they both have the designation A01B
   indicates they are structurally similar and the shredout is used to differentiate other
   differences, such as rank in this case.
   3.6.11. Pavement Condition. In general, only shred out additional sections on an apron or
   taxiway due to condition if the area involved is 25% or more of the total section area and the
   weighted area average PCI of the sample units within each area differs by at least 15 points.
   Note that these criteria are somewhat arbitrary and are intended as a rule of thumb. The
   objective is to only create new sections that significantly impact the results of the evaluation.
   Don’t subdivide small sections.
3.7. Segmentation of Roads, Driveways, and Vehicle Parking Areas. As outlined in
paragraph 3.4., the starting point for aligning branches and sections from the pavement
management system with real property facilities is obtaining a pavement facility map that clearly
shows the geospatial extent of each pavement facility listed in the real property record (including
paved and unpaved roads, drives, and parking areas). If that map does not exist, it must be
created before assigning branches and sections to facilities. The base Real Property Officer will
work with the base Pavement Engineer and the GeoBase office to ensure that each pavement
facility on a base is identified on the map.
   3.7.1. The segmentation taxonomy for roadways and parking areas, as for airfields, is
   network, branch, and section, as shown in Figure 3.3. The same processes described above
   for creating a pavement facility map and assigning branches and sections to airfield facilities
   applies. In addition, the same hierarchy shown in Figure 3.1 for network, facility, branch,
   and section applies to roads and parking areas. As discussed in paragraph 3.3, there will be
   instances where the hierarchy shown in Figure 3.1 cannot be maintained without
   compromising the ability to manage the asset from an engineering perspective. An example
   for roads is a perimeter road that has three facility numbers for different portions of the road.
   Following the hierarchy would require dividing a single branch (RDPERIM) into multiple
   branches, preventing analysis of that branch as a single entity. If the RPO cannot combine
   the facilities, disregard the hierarchy and maintain the integrity of the branch. Following are
   some specific rules for segmenting roads and vehicle parking areas.
   3.7.2. Several networks are typically created for an installation. One will be created for all
   paved roads, driveways, and parking areas, and one for all unsurfaced roads, driveways, and
   parking areas. In most instances, a separate network is created for housing areas, especially
   if there is indication they may be privatized. Separate networks are also created for the roads
   and parking associated with geographically separate sites.
AFI32-1041 10 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                  21


Figure 3.3. Segmentation of Roads and Parking Lots.




   3.7.3. Branches. Historically, each named road on a base and each parking area or group of
   parking areas associated with a specific building or function have been given a branch
   designation. Following are specific rules for creating these branches.
      3.7.3.1. Road Branches. Each named road on a base is designated as a separate branch.
      As with airfields, each of these branches is assigned a rank based on the criteria outlined
      in paragraph 9.3.2. If a portion of a named road is primary and another portion is
      secondary, create separate sections for each.
          3.7.3.1.1. The process of assigning branches and sections is simple, if all paved roads
          on a base are assigned to one facility. However, it becomes more complex when all
          concrete roads are one facility and all asphalt roads are combined in one facility or
          there are multiple road facilities based on other criteria. Ideally, branches should be
          created to ensure that no branch is assigned to more than one facility. However in the
          event of a conflict as described in paragraph 3.3., the hierarchy may be disregarded to
          ensure the integrity of the branch. For example, a portion of Main Street is
          constructed of concrete and a portion is asphalt. Each of these areas is a portion of
          the branch for Main Street. If there is a separate facility for concrete roads and one
          for asphalt roads, maintain the Main Street branch, but break out sections to align
          with the respective asphalt and concrete road facilities. If a base has two sites or
          networks and a branch crosses into different sites or networks, the branch must be
          divided to ensure a branch is not assigned to more than one network.
      3.7.3.2. Assigning Road Branches. A surfaced road will use the prefix RD and
      unsurfaced road will use the prefix UR. The road name will be used as the remainder of
      the branch name (e.g. RDMAIN or URPERIMETER). There will be instances where the
      road does not have a name, especially unsurfaced roads. In these cases, give unnamed
      roads temporary names (URUNAMED1, 2, 3 etc). Before completing the report have the
      base review all unnamed roads and provide names if they are available. If names are not
      available, use the temporary name you assigned.
22                                                         AFI32-1041 10 SEPTEMBER 2013


     3.7.3.3. Parking Area Branches. Assign each parking area or group of parking areas
     associated with a specific building or function a branch ID and name. Note that a parking
     area branch includes the access road or access driveway servicing that parking area.
     Each of these branches will be assigned to the appropriate facility. This will be straight
     forward when all parking areas on a base are combined into one facility for each
     respective category code or each parking area has its own facility number. The pavement
     facility map for roads and parking will provide the primary guide for assigning branches
     to facilities.
     3.7.3.4. Assigning Parking Area Branches. Typically, the parking area will use the
     building number it is associated with or the function of the parking area as the branch
     name (e.g. PA1138 or PAEXCHANGE). If the parking area does not have a name;
     especially unsurfaced parking areas, give the unnamed parking area a temporary name
     (PAUNNAMED1, 2, 3 etc). Before completing the report have the base review all
     unnamed parking areas and provide names if they are available. If they are not available,
     use the temporary name.
  3.7.4. . A section is a portion of a branch that differs in pavement characteristics from other
  sections such that further segmentation is required to uniquely identify that section. This
  may include pavement type, construction history, traffic volume, or other physical
  characteristics, such as the number of lanes. Note that sections for roads and parking are
  treated differently than those for airfields in that the section number is unique for each branch
  but is not unique for the base as a whole. For example, the branch for Main Street, RDMAIN
  has 24 sections numbered 01 thru 24. The branch for Flightline Road, RDFLIGHT is made
  up of 16 sections numbered 01 thru 16. The only way to distinguish a section uniquely is by
  the concatenation (branch ID plus section ID) of the branch and the section.
     3.7.4.1. Road . If the only difference in a road is the pavement material type—concrete
     for part of the road and asphalt for the remainder of the road—that road branch has two
     sections. If there is a long road section with consistent physical characteristics, create a
     section break approximately every half mile. Since base roads do not typically have mile
     markers, try to create these breaks where the road intersects with another road, a parking
     area, or some other distinguishable feature. The intent of this guidance is not to create a
     section break at each intersection, but rather to create enough sections to ensure adequate
     sampling for projecting maintenance and repair requirements.
     3.7.4.2. at Inter. Pavement section breaks are not created at each intersection unless
     there is a change in characteristics or some other factor that drives the creation of the
     section break at that intersection. When required at an intersection, the section break will
     be shown as a single line perpendicular to the centerline. The pavement in the
     intersection will be assigned to the road with the higher rank. When roads are of equal
     rank, the pavement in the intersection will be assigned to one of the roads, ensuring there
     is no double counting of pavement area.
     3.7.4.3. Parking Area . Similar to roads and airfields, parking area branches will be
     subdivided into sections based on their physical characteristics or construction history.
     The access road serving a parking area is part of the branch for that parking area and is
     assigned the appropriate parking area category code for that facility. If the access road
     has the same construction as the parking area it serves, it can be included with the
AFI32-1041 10 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                   23


       parking area section. If the access road is constructed differently or is long, it will be
       assigned a separate section number for the parking area branch. If the parking area is
       shared between buildings, it may have two separate facility numbers. If that is the case,
       create separate sections so they can be assigned to the appropriate facility.
       3.7.4.4. Driveways. As mentioned in 3.3.2.5, the term driveway refers specifically to
       pavements in housing that serves a residence(s). All driveways on a base may be
       included in a single facility or each specific housing area may be designated as a separate
       facility. All driveways on a given street should be included in a single branch and that
       branch assigned to the appropriate driveway facility. Each individual driveway may be
       assigned a section if it has sufficient area, or groups of driveways with similar
       characteristics may be combined in a section to get an adequate sample unit. Note that if
       the housing area is privatized, inventory the roads, driveways, and parking, but do not
       inspect them. If the housing area is not privatized, inspect the pavements unless
       otherwise stipulated in the Statement of Work.
3.8. Pavement Segmentation Mapping. Mapping plays a key role in achieving the OSD linear
segmentation objectives. In order to ensure the entire pavement inventory is mapped consistently
and accurately, pavement evaluation teams and contractors will use the following process when
doing a structural pavement evaluation or pavement condition index survey. Additional details
can be found in the Linear Segmentation Playbook that can be accessed at
https://cs.eis.af.mil/a7cportal/CEPlaybooks/OPS/LI/default.aspx
   3.8.1. Obtain the latest Pavement Facility Map and Common Installation Picture (CIP) as
   well as the latest imagery from the base prior to beginning the evaluation. Ensure you have
   the metadata associated with both the CIP and imagery and determine the source and
   accuracy of the vector data in the CIP. In addition obtain a copy of the Airfield Pavement
   Plan (E-7 Tab), and Airfield Pavement Details (E-8 Tab) if available. Identify any
   significant issues with the mapping, such as misaligned pavements, duplicate polygons, or
   other issues that affect the accuracy of the map. The metadata plays a key role in that the
   pavement vector data in the CIP may have been generated from earlier imagery or an actual
   survey. If this is the case, the vector data may not align with the current imagery. Ensure
   that any changes made to the CIP are based on more accurate data. Work with the base
   GeoBase office to resolve any issues prior to the start of the evaluation.
   3.8.2. Current guidance in this AFI will drive changes to past pavement segmentation. Make
   any required changes to the branches and sections based on the current imagery, pavement
   facility map, and construction history data provided by the base prior to the evaluation.
   During the evaluation, make modifications to the branches and sections as well as any
   changes required to the CIP based on field observations. Document the changes made to the
   CIP for coordination with the base as a separate document when submitting the report.
   3.8.3. Provide a copy of the updated map (in shape file format), along with the change
   documentation, to the base GeoBase office at the outbrief for their review as part of the draft
   report review process. Address all base comments regarding mapping and provide the base
   with a response on resolution of comments.
   3.8.4. Provide a copy of the updated map (in shape file format and/or geodatabase format)
   with the final report. Note that in addition to the shape file, contractors are required to
   provide all source files in ESRI or AutoCAD format, as appropriate.

                 AIRFIELD STRUCTURAL PAVEMENT EVALUATION

4.1. Basic Concepts. In theory, the pavement evaluation procedure is the reverse of the design
procedure. The design procedure uses a known design aircraft loading and foundation strength to
determine the physical characteristics of the required pavement structure. The evaluation
procedure uses known physical characteristics to determine allowable gross loads (AGL) at
various pass levels for specific aircraft groups. This section outlines some basic principles and
factors that affect pavements and explains how to systematically obtain physical property data.
   4.1.1. Size of Load.
       4.1.1.1. To compute loads on the pavement structure, the Air Force uses: aircraft gross
       weights; gear configurations; tire spacing (for multiple wheel assemblies); tire pressure or
       contact area; and weight distribution/center of gravity.
       4.1.1.2. To simplify the mechanics of the evaluation, AFCEC assigns Air Force and
       selected DOD and commercial aircraft to 14 aircraft groups (see Figure 4-1). It then
       selects a controlling aircraft for those aircraft groups containing more than one aircraft.
       The controlling aircraft is the aircraft in a particular group that causes the maximum state
       of stress in a pavement system.
   4.1.2. Frequency of Load. Load repetitions (aircraft passes) greatly affect pavement life.
   Pavement life can be expressed in terms of different aircraft weight and pass level
   combinations. Definitions of passes are contained in UFC 3-260-03. The Air Force evaluates
   each section for the 14 aircraft groups at the four pass intensity levels shown in Figure 4.1.
   Figure 4.2 shows the gear type for each aircraft and the Federal Aviation Administration
   (FAA) designation. Stress points used to calculate allowable loads are also indicated by the
   red “+” symbols under each gear configuration.
   4.1.3. Distribution of Loads. Distribution of loads also affects pavement life. Traffic tends
   to be more concentrated (channelized) on taxiways and runway ends and more evenly
   distributed (nonchannelized) on the interior portions of runways and on aprons.
4.2. Determination of Pavement Capability.
   4.2.1. AGL. For each section, AFCEC determines separate AGLs for the four pass intensity
   levels shown in Figure 4.1. Only four pass levels are used to simplify reporting. The AGLs
   associated with levels I through IV are based on the physical property data or layered elastic
   data for each section. For frost-susceptible areas, AFCEC publishes a second table of AGLs
   if applicable (see UFC 3-260-03). These AGLs are determined for each section for the four
   pass intensity levels but are based on reduced subgrade strength or reduced modulus values
   during the frost-thaw period. For sections with a PCI less than or equal to 40, the AGL is
   reduced by 25 percent. Values in the AGL tables are capped at 2 million pounds (907,185
   kilograms).

Figure 4.2. Gear Types.




   4.2.2. Pavement Classification Number (PCN). AFCEC determines and reports the
   airfield PCN, as defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), for each
   section. The PCN expresses the capability of a pavement to support aircraft traffic and varies
   with aircraft weight, gear configuration, and the number of passes. However, since ICAO
   only requires reporting the PCN of the runway, the runway PCN is reported on the
   documentation page and executive summary of the report. The runway PCN is based on the
   weakest section in the first 1,000 feet (305 meters) of each end of the runway (full width) or
   in the central keel (75 feet [23 meters]) for the remainder of the runway. Overruns and the
   remaining non-keel pavements of the runway interior are excluded. The Air Force standard
   for reporting PCNs is 50,000 passes of a C-17. This is because the C-17 is the primary heavy
   cargo aircraft for the Air Force and is expected to continue to be the primary heavy cargo
   aircraft well into the future. Using a standard aircraft and number of passes enables the Air
   Force to compare pavement capability across the entire Air Force. The Army and Navy select
   a critical aircraft and project passes or equivalent passes for the pavement life, normally 20
   years.
   4.2.3. Evaluation Technique. AFCEC follows these fundamental steps in all pavement
   evaluations:
      4.2.3.1. Thoroughly study all existing information regarding design, construction,
      maintenance, and traffic history of the pavements. AFCEC also reviews:
          4.2.3.1.1. Previous pavement evaluation or condition survey reports;
          4.2.3.1.2. Results of physical property tests of pavements; and,

      4.2.3.2. Determine or validate the pavement condition by a cursory visual inspection.
      Both the standard PCI rating outlined in American Society for Testing and Materials
      (ASTM) D5340, Standard Test Method for Airport Pavement Condition Index Surveys,
      and a simplified pavement condition rating, shown in Figure 4.3, are used.

Figure 4.3. ASTM D5340 PCI Rating and Simplified PCI Rating.




      4.2.3.3. Determine the scope and validity of available data and determine what additional
      information and tests are needed.
      4.2.3.4. Obtain field data and samples. Samples are tested in the field or sent to AFCEC
      for laboratory testing and data analysis.
      4.2.3.5. Select the representative strength and thickness values for the individual sections
      that comprise the pavement structure.
      4.2.3.6. Determine AGLs and PCNs for each pavement section using representative
      physical property data and field test results.
      4.2.3.7. Develop recommendations for major M&R based on results of the evaluation.
4.3. Methods and Procedures.
   4.3.1. Before AFCEC schedules an evaluation, preferably within 2 years, a PCI survey
   should be performed in accordance with ASTM standards. The survey may be performed
   with in-house resources, by local contract, or through an AFCEC contract.
   4.3.2. Each year, AFCEC sends an annual call letter to the MAJCOMs, asking for the
   structural evaluation requirements for the following fiscal year.
 28                                                        AFI32-1041 10 SEPTEMBER 2013


   4.3.3. The MAJCOMs respond with a priority listing of bases requiring evaluation in the
   following fiscal year, along with proper justification, including the PCI rating for each
   section.
   4.3.4. Based on this information, AFCEC develops a schedule for structural evaluations.
   4.3.5. In the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, AFCEC informs the MAJCOMs about which
   bases it has selected for evaluation the following fiscal year.
   4.3.6. In prioritizing bases for evaluation, MAJCOMs consider:
      4.3.6.1. Time since the last evaluation. Structural evaluations normally occur every 7 to
      10 years.
      4.3.6.2. Operational requirements or mission changes that significantly change pavement
      loading.
      4.3.6.3. Safety issues caused by structural deterioration since the last evaluation.
      4.3.6.4. Plans for major reconstruction or rehabilitation projects.
      4.3.6.5. New construction for which there is no sufficient design, as-built, or physical
      property data to determine the pavement’s load-bearing capability.
   4.3.7. Approximately 3 months before deployment, AFCEC sends a letter to the scheduled
   base (with a copy to the responsible MAJCOM) detailing the support needed for the
   evaluation.
   4.3.8. AFCEC reviews construction and traffic history, soils and drainage data, master plans,
   and other data, when available, to plan the test program and to develop the evaluation report.
4.4. Field Tests. During the field testing phase of an AFCEC pavement evaluation, required
pavement and soil layer physical property data are obtained. This phase usually takes 8 to
12 calendar days, depending on the size of the base.
   4.4.1. Base airfield operations personnel should plan on closing a runway for 1 to 2 days for
   an evaluation; however, the pavement evaluation team can respond quickly to emergencies if
   the runway is needed.
   4.4.2. AFCEC decides which data are required and which specific types of tests to conduct
   based on pavement type, construction history, problem areas, mission, and various other
   factors.
   4.4.3. The pavement evaluation team obtains data and samples and conducts assessments,
   including:
      4.4.3.1. Type of pavement.
      4.4.3.2. In situ pavement and soil layer thicknesses, including total thickness above the
      natural subgrade for flexible pavements.
      4.4.3.3. Cores used to determine the thickness of surface materials and the flexural
      strength of the concrete using split-tensile tests.
      4.4.3.4. Heavy weight deflectometer (HWD) deflection measurements used to determine
      pavement capability using modulus of elasticity and layered elastic theory (non-
      destructive evaluation).
AFI32-1041 10 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                     29


       4.4.3.5. Strength and thickness of underlying layers (California Bearing Ratio (CBR) or
       k (modulus of soil reaction) value) using the dynamic cone penetrometer (DCP) or the
       automated DCP (semi-destructive).
       4.4.3.6. Effective modulus of subgrade reaction for rigid pavements or CBR for flexible
       pavements measured in excavated pits (destructive evaluation, not commonly used due to
       impact on operations).
       4.4.3.7. Modulus of elasticity for each pavement and soil layer (non-destructive).
       4.4.3.8. In situ moisture content and density of subgrade soils and base course materials
       (destructive evaluation).
       4.4.3.9. Cursory visual assessment of pavement condition.
       4.4.3.10. Soil samples for sections for which no previous data exist, as required. Sieve
       analysis and Atterberg limits tests are performed to classify the soil using the Unified Soil
       Classification System.
       4.4.3.11. Quality of subgrade, subbase, and granular base courses (tested in situ).
Note: Laboratory tests on samples of materials and construction control data supplement the
field tests. The team determines the pavement and soil layer physical properties by visual
observations, laboratory tests on pavement samples, or from construction data.
4.5. Laboratory Tests. ASTM standards are used for laboratory and field testing. As with field
testing, the data and types of tests required in the laboratory vary with the situation.
4.6. Evaluation Procedure. The evaluation thoroughly analyzes all physical property and
laboratory data and selects representative thickness and strength data and the appropriate
evaluation method and computer codes to determine the AGL and PCN for each section.
4.7. Structural Reports.
   4.7.1. Preliminary Findings. The pavement evaluation team normally provides an outbrief
   to base officials after completing the field investigations. The outbrief summarizes the results
   of the cursory visual inspection, testing accomplished, test results, preliminary data analysis,
   preliminary recommendations, and immediate actions required, if any. A draft copy of the
   appendices for the final report is left with the base after the outbrief.
   4.7.2. Final Pavement Evaluation Report. AFCEC prepares, publishes, and distributes a
   final pavement evaluation report after all laboratory and field testing has been completed,
   results analyzed, and AGL and PCN values determined. The report includes:
       4.7.2.1. Executive Summary: A synopsis of the evaluation, the results, and
       recommendations.
       4.7.2.2. Introduction: A statement of the purpose, objectives, and scope of the
       evaluation, including a description of the evaluated pavements. The introduction includes
       potential uses of the report and a description of the appendices.

      each pavement section. A typical summary includes:
AFI32-1041 10 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                   31


        4.7.3.1.1. Section number;
        4.7.3.1.2. Pavement identification, e.g., runway, taxiway, apron;
        4.7.3.1.3. Area of the section;
        4.7.3.1.4. General condition (simplified PCI) of the pavement;
        4.7.3.1.5. Type and thickness of overlay pavement, pavement base, subbase, and
        subgrade;

        4.7.3.1.10. Real Property Report.
     4.7.3.2. Summary of AGLs: Contains tables listing AGLs for each pavement section
     for the four pass intensity levels and the 14 aircraft groups (Figure 4.1). Paragraphs
     4.7.3.2.1. and 4.7.3.2.2. provide descriptions of the number and types of tables that are
     normally published:
        4.7.3.2.1. One table contains AGLs that are computed and reported within a range
        from the lowest weight of the lightest aircraft to the highest weight of the heaviest
        aircraft in each aircraft group (see Figure 4.1). AGLs are calculated for each section
        at four pass intensity levels. Values are shaded green when the computed AGL is
        greater than the maximum weight of any aircraft in the group (also seen as a “+” in
        older reports). Values are shaded yellow when the computed AGL is between the
        minimum and maximum weight of any aircraft in the group and aircraft should be
        limited to this weight to preserve pavement life to the specified pass intensity level.
        The value is shaded red with white text (also seen as an “A” in older reports) when
        the computed AGL is less than the minimum weight of any aircraft in the group.
        4.7.3.2.2. For locations considered susceptible to frost action based on climate and
        soil classification, an additional table is published. This table is presented in the same
        format as described in paragraph 4.7.3.2.1, but is derived based on reduced subgrade
        strength or reduced modulus values to account for weakened conditions during the
        frost melt period.
     4.7.3.3. PCNs.
        4.7.3.3.1. PCNs are presented for each section based on the ICAO procedure as
        outlined in UFC 3-260-03. Along with the PCN number, the pavement type, subgrade
        strength category, tire pressure category, and evaluation method are reported. A code
        system, implemented to allow an abbreviated presentation of the necessary
        information, is used as follows:
            4.7.3.3.1.1. The pavement type is abbreviated “R” for rigid (portland cement
            concrete [PCC]) or “F” for flexible (asphalt concrete [AC]) pavements.
            4.7.3.3.1.2. The four subgrade categories—A, B, C, and D—indicate high,
 32                                                       AFI32-1041 10 SEPTEMBER 2013


              medium, low, and ultralow subgrade strengths, respectively.
              4.7.3.3.1.3. The four tire pressure categories—W, X, Y, and Z—indicate high,
              medium, low, and very low tire pressures, respectively.
              4.7.3.3.1.4. The evaluation methods are “T” for a technical evaluation or “U” for
              an evaluation based on the type of aircraft that commonly use the airfield.
          4.7.3.3.2. The PCN code 31/R/C/W/T, for example, indicates a PCN numerical value
          of 31, a rigid pavement, a low-strength subgrade, that high-pressure tires are allowed,
          and that a technical evaluation was performed to determine the PCN. AFCEC
          determines and reports the airfield PCN for 50,000 passes of the C-17.
4.8. Distribution of Reports. AFCEC distributes the final report to the BCE; airfield manager;
appropriate MAJCOMs; Air National Guard; Air Force Reserves; Headquarters Air Mobility
Command, Directorate of Operations (HQ AMC/A3); Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT);
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Engineer Research and Development Center (USACE/ERDC);
USACE Transportation Systems Center (USACE/TSMCX); Naval Facilities Engineering
Command (NAVFAC); National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA); Air Force Research
Laboratory (AFRL); Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA); and Defense Technical
Information Center (DTIC). Contact AFCEC for a detailed distribution list.
4.9. Updating Physical Property Data.
   4.9.1. To ensure that physical property data remain current, construction agencies must
   provide the as-built or design data on all airfield pavement projects to the BCE. The BCE, in
   turn, provides a copy of the following information to AFCEC on pavements that have been
   constructed or reconstructed since the last pavement evaluation:
       4.9.1.1. Type of surface and texture (PCC, AC, surface treatment and burlap drag, wire
       combed, grooved, porous, rough, medium, and smooth, etc.).
       4.9.1.2. Thickness of the pavement and each layer in the pavement structure.
       4.9.1.3. Subgrade and base course moisture contents and densities.
       4.9.1.4. PCC flexural strength test results.
       4.9.1.5. CBR/k/modulus values from design/construction records.
   4.9.2. The BCE maintains construction records, including as-built drawings on all pavement
   projects that are under BCE control.
   4.9.3. If the airfield pavement undergoes major changes, such as reconstruction or
   rehabilitation, AFCEC may use as-built and construction control data to reevaluate the
   pavement. If an airfield pavement system undergoes significant structural changes but the
   construction data are either inadequate or unavailable, the BCE can request a new pavement
   evaluation.

              RUNWAY FRICTION CHARACTERISTICS EVALUATIONS

5.1. Runway Friction Characteristics Evaluation. An AFCEC runway friction characteristics
evaluation assesses a runway's tractive qualities and hydroplaning potential. Since these
properties are subject to change with time and traffic, an evaluation will determine what, if any,
maintenance may be required.
   5.1.1. Frequency. MAJCOMs should request a runway friction characteristics evaluation
   when:
       5.1.1.1. Recent evaluation reports recommend frequent testing.
       5.1.1.2. Surface treatment significantly alters the runway surface characteristics (for
       example, grooving, texturing, overlay, or reconstruction). When runways are grooved,
       textured, etc., as a result of an AFCEC recommendation to improve safety, the base
       should verify the results by independent testing.
       5.1.1.3. A mission change significantly alters the runway's rate of wear and rubber
       accumulation.
       5.1.1.4. An aircraft skidding accident or incident occurs.
   5.1.2. Evaluation Schedule. AFCEC develops an annual friction characteristics evaluation
   program based on MAJCOM requirements. The annual data call process is described in
   section 4.3.
   5.1.3. Support Requirements. AFCEC will provide the base detailed support requirements
   approximately 6 weeks prior to the evaluation.
   5.1.4. Evaluation Procedures. The evaluation report describes the procedures for
   evaluating runway friction characteristics, including equipment descriptions, testing methods,
   and some theory on their use. Testing includes friction tests, slope measurements, and texture
   measurements. Procedures and equipment generally correspond to those outlined in FAA
   Advisory Circular (AC) 150/5320-12C, Measurement, Construction, and Maintenance of
   SkidResistant Airport Pavement Surfaces.
   5.1.5. Evaluation Report. After conducting the field evaluation, AFCEC analyzes the
   results and publishes a formal report. This report includes:
       5.1.5.1. A description of the equipment and test procedures;
       5.1.5.2. A summary of the pertinent data and results;
       5.1.5.3. The criteria for analysis;
       5.1.5.4. Interpretation of the results based on these criteria and the judgment of the
       engineer;
       5.1.5.5. A narrative that presents the engineer's conclusions and recommendations for
       improving the runway's friction characteristics; and,
       5.1.5.6. Appendices that document the data collected during testing. These appendices
       are described in Table 5.1.
 34                                                       AFI32-1041 10 SEPTEMBER 2013

 Appendix      Description
               Slope Measurements: Displays the slopes measured on the runway. The
      A
               transverse and longitudinal slopes are measured every 500 feet (152 meters).
               Texture Measurements: Presents the texture depth for various locations and the
      B
               rainfall intensities required to flood these areas.
               Friction Measurements: Contains average friction values and friction plots for
      C        the entire length of the runway and describes the guidelines for determining
               acceptable friction characteristics.
               Estimation of Rubber Deposits: Presents a method to determine rubber removal
      D
               requirements based on visual inspections.
5.2. Distribution of Runway Friction Characteristics Evaluation Reports. Hard copies of
the report are provided to the base pavement engineer, airfield manager, appropriate MAJCOM
pavement engineer, and are kept on file at AFCEC. Electronic copies are made available through
the AFCEC Pavements Reports Web site, and notifications are sent to AFIT, NGB, NAVFAC,
ERDC, DTIC, AFFSA, TSMCX, NGA, and HQ AMC/A3.
5.3. Runway Roughness Evaluation. A runway roughness evaluation examines the elevation
profile of the runway surface and evaluates aircraft response to this profile. AFCEC no longer
conducts these evaluations but maintains contact with the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA), the FAA, and other organizations conducting research in this field and
with contractors that perform the evaluations. Bases requiring a runway roughness evaluation
can contact AFCEC for assistance.
5.4. Runway Rubber Removal Determination. Most bases schedule runway rubber removal
based on the amount of time between cleanings or a visual inspection rather than measuring the
friction reduction effects of the rubber accumulation using CFME. The following subparagraphs,
adopted in part from FAA AC 150/5320-12C and other FAA standards, provide guidance for
using a CFME unit to determine when to schedule rubber removal on Air Force runways. Some
bases have CFME that is used to determine when to remove snow and ice. This guidance
provides the information necessary for those bases to use the CFME to determine rubber removal
frequency or to contract to determine rubber removal frequency. AFCEC does not routinely
schedule friction tests strictly to determine when to remove rubber.
   5.4.1. Background. Skid resistance of runway pavement deteriorates due to a number of
   factors, primarily: 1) mechanical wear and polishing action from aircraft tires rolling or
   braking on the pavement and from snow removal equipment, and 2) the accumulation of
   contaminants, chiefly rubber, on the pavement surface. The effects of these two factors are
   directly dependent on the volume and type of aircraft traffic. In addition, rubber deposits
   obscure airfield markings, which can become a safety issue. The most persistent contaminant
   problem is deposits of rubber from tires of landing jet aircraft. Rubber deposits occur at the
   touchdown areas on runways and can be quite extensive. Heavy rubber deposits can
   completely cover the pavement surface texture, causing loss of aircraft braking capability and
   directional control, particularly when runways are wet.
   5.4.2. Minimum Friction Survey Frequency. Table 5.2 is provided as guidance for
   scheduling runway friction testing for rubber removal. This table is based on an average mix
AFI32-1041 10 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                     35


    of turbojet aircraft operating on any particular runway. When, of the total aircraft mix, a
    runway end has 20 percent or more wide body aircraft (e.g., B-52, C-5, C-17, C-130, KC-10,
    KC-135, etc.), select the next higher level of aircraft operations in Table 5.2 to determine the
    minimum testing frequency. As data is accumulated on the rate of change of runway friction
    under various traffic conditions, the scheduling of friction surveys may be adjusted to ensure
    that evaluators will detect and predict marginal friction conditions in time to take corrective
    actions.

*Each runway end should be evaluated separately, e.g., Runway 18 and Runway 36.
    5.4.3. General Requirements.
       5.4.3.1. FAA Performance Standards for CFME. Appendix 3 of FAA AC 150/5320-
       12C contains the performance specifications for CFME. These standards should be
       followed in procuring CFME and replacement tires for the equipment.
       5.4.3.2. FAA Qualified Product List. The equipment listed in Appendix 4 of FAA AC
       150/5320-12C has been tested and meets the FAA standards for CFME for use in
       conducting maintenance friction tests.
       5.4.3.3. Training of Personnel. As stated in FAA AC 150/5320-12C, “The success of
       friction measurement in delivering reliable friction data depends heavily on the personnel
       who are responsible for operating the equipment. Adequate professional training on the
       operation and maintenance of the CFME and the procedures for conducting friction
       measurement should be provided, either as part of the procurement package or as a
       separate contract with the manufacturer. Also, recurrent training is necessary for review
       and update to ensure that the operator maintains a high level of proficiency.”1 Experience
       has shown that without recurrent training, personnel will not be aware of new
       developments on equipment calibration, maintenance, and operating techniques. A
       suggested training outline is provided in Appendix 5 of FAA AC 150/5320-12C. Training
       should include both the operation and maintenance of the CFME and the procedures for
       conducting friction surveys. These procedures are provided in section 5.4.4 of this AFI.
       5.4.3.4. Equipment Calibration. All CFME should be checked for calibration within
       tolerances provided by the manufacturer before conducting friction surveys. The CFME

Surfaces, Advisory Circular 150/5320-12C (March 1997), 20.

     self-wetting system should be calibrated periodically to ensure that the water flow rate is
     correct and that the amount of water produced for the required water depth is consistent
     and applied evenly in front of the friction measuring wheel(s) for all test speeds.
  5.4.4. Conducting Friction Evaluations with CFME.
     5.4.4.1. Preliminary Steps. Friction measurement operations should be preceded by a
     thorough visual inspection of the pavement to identify inadequacies such as drainage
     problems, including ponding and groove deterioration, and structural deficiencies.
     Careful and complete notes should be taken, not only of the CFME data but also of the
     visual inspection. Personnel operating equipment should be fully trained and current in
     all procedures. The CFME should be checked for accurate calibration and the vehicle
     checked for adequate braking ability. Remove aircraft arresting cables to prevent damage
     to equipment.
     5.4.4.2. Location of Friction Surveys on the Runway. When conducting friction
     surveys on the runway(s) at 40 miles per hour (mph) (65 kilometers per hour [km/h]), the
     operator should begin recording data at the threshold when adequate overruns with in-
     ground lighting are present. If the length of the overrun is such that the operator cannot
     accelerate to speed before crossing the threshold, then data should be collected as soon as
     the vehicle reaches 40 mph (65 km/h). The friction survey should be terminated
     approximately 500 feet (152 meters) from the opposite end of the runway if the length of
     the overrun is not adequate for the operator to use the overrun for deceleration; otherwise,
     the survey should be terminated at the threshold. When conducting friction surveys on the
     runway(s) at 60 mph (97 km/h), the operator should begin recording data at the threshold
     when adequate overruns with in-ground lighting are present. If the length of the overrun
     is such that the operator cannot accelerate to speed before crossing the threshold, then
     data should be collected as soon as the vehicle reaches 60 mph (97 km/h). The friction
     survey should be terminated approximately 1,000 feet (305 meters) from the opposite end
     of the runway if the length of the overrun is not adequate for the operator to use the
     overrun for deceleration; otherwise, the survey should be terminated at the threshold.
     Where travel beyond the end of the runway or overrun could result in equipment damage
     or personal injury, additional runway length should be allowed for stopping. The lateral
     location on the runway for performing the tests should be 10 and 20 feet (3 and 6 meters)
     from the centerline. Unless surface conditions are noticeably different on either side of
     the runway centerline, a test on one side of the centerline in the same direction the
     aircraft lands should be sufficient; however, when both ends of the runway are to be
     evaluated, vehicle runs can be made to record data on the return trip (both ways).
     5.4.4.3. Vehicle Speed for Conducting Surveys. FAA-approved CFME can be used at
     either 40 or 60 mph (65 or 97 km/h). The lower speed determines the overall
     macrotexture/contaminant/drainage condition of the pavement surface. The higher speed
     provides an indication of the condition of the surface’s microtexture. A complete survey
     should include tests at both speeds.
     5.4.4.4. Use of CFME Self-Wetting System. Since wet pavement always yields the
     lowest friction measurements, the CFME should be equipped with a self-wetting system
     to simulate worst case conditions. Self-wetting systems simulate rain to produce wet
     pavement surface conditions and provide the operator with a continuous record of friction
AFI32-1041 10 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                 37


     values along the length of the runway. The attached nozzle(s) are designed to provide a
     uniform water depth of 0.04 inch (1 mm) in front of the friction measuring tire(s). This
     wetted surface produces friction values that are the most meaningful in determining
     whether or not corrective action is required.
     5.4.4.5. Friction Level Classification. Mu numbers (friction values) measured by
     CFME can be used as guidelines for evaluating the surface friction deterioration of
     runway pavements and for identifying the appropriate corrective actions necessary for
     safe aircraft operations. Table 3-2 of FAA AC 150/5320-12C depicts the friction values
     for three classification levels for FAAqualified CFME operated at 40- and 60-mph (65-
     and 97-km/h) test speeds. This table was developed from qualification and correlation
     tests conducted at NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility.
     5.4.4.6. Evaluation and Maintenance Guidelines. The evaluation and maintenance
     guidelines in the following subparagraphs are recommended based on the friction levels
     classified in Table 3-2 of FAA AC 150/5320-12C. These guidelines take into account that
     poor friction conditions for short distances on the runway do not pose a safety problem to
     aircraft, but long stretches of slippery pavement are of serious concern and require
     prompt remedial action.
        5.4.4.6.1. Friction Deterioration Below the Maintenance Planning Friction Level
        (500 feet [152 meters]). When the average Mu value on the wet runway pavement
        surface at both 40 and 60 mph (65 and 97 km/h) is less than the Maintenance
        Planning Friction Level but above the Minimum Friction Level in Table 3-2 of FAA
        AC 150/5320-12C for a distance of 500 feet (152 meters), and the adjacent 500-foot
        (152-meter) segments are at or above the Maintenance Planning Friction Level, no
        corrective action is required. These readings indicate that the pavement friction is
        deteriorating but the situation is still within an acceptable overall condition.
        5.4.4.6.2. Friction Deterioration Below the Maintenance Planning Friction Level
        (1000 feet [305 meters]). When the average Mu value on the wet runway pavement
        surface at both 40 and 60 mph (65 and 97 km/h) is less than the Maintenance
        Planning Friction Level in Table 3-2 of FAA AC 150/5320-12C for a distance of
        1,000 feet (305 meters) or more, an extensive evaluation should be conducted to
        determine the causes and extent of the friction deterioration. If the surface has rubber
        buildup, the airfield manager should submit a work request to have rubber removed
        from the affected areas of the runway.
        5.4.4.6.3. Friction Deterioration Below the Minimum Friction Level. When the
        average Mu value on the wet pavement surface at both 40 and 60 mph (65 and 97
        km/h) is below the Minimum Friction Level in Table 3-2 of FAA AC 150/5320-12C
        for a distance of 500 feet (152 meters), and the adjacent 500-foot (152-meter)
        segments are below the Maintenance Planning Friction Level, action should be taken
        immediately to correct the affected areas of the runway. Before undertaking
        corrective measures, inspect the overall condition of the entire runway pavement
        surface to determine if other deficiencies exist that may require additional corrective
        action.

             TESTING OF POWER CHECK PAD ANCHORING SYSTEMS

6.1. Background. Most Air Force fighter aircraft use aircraft anchoring systems during power
checks and routine maintenance procedures. When requested by the MAJCOMs, AFCEC tests
anchors to determine their capability to safely support the loads imposed by these aircraft.
AFCEC tests only existing power check pad anchors: AFCEC does not test Hush House anchors
or new power check pad anchors. If new power check pad anchors are constructed as specified in
applicable UFCs or Engineering Technical Letters (ETLs), testing is not required; however, if
there are quality concerns, proof loading to ensure that new anchors meet operational
requirements should be included in the project documents. Emergency requests for testing of
new anchors must be approved by the AFCEC commander and will require funding by the
MAJCOM/base. Equipment and inspection and testing procedures are detailed in Appendix G of
UFC 3-260-03. The base provides a forklift or crane for the tests.
6.2. Testing Schedule. AFCEC develops an annual anchor testing program based on MAJCOM
requirements. The annual data call process is described in section 4.3.
6.3. Anchor Testing Report. After completion of field testing and data analysis, AFCEC
publishes an anchor testing report. The report documents the equipment and procedures used to
test the anchors and includes proof load data. The report also contains a proof load affidavit.
Examples of the recorded data and the affidavit are provided in UFC 3-260-03, Appendix G.
6.4. Report Distribution. AFCEC distributes the anchor test report to the appropriate base and
MAJCOMs and maintains files at AFCEC.

                     PAVEMENT CONDITION SURVEY PROGRAM

7.1. Program Management. AFCEC manages the Air Force pavement condition survey
program. Responsibilities include maintaining files of all previous condition survey reports for
each base, maintaining on-call contracts for conducting condition surveys,
scheduling/monitoring contract work when funds are provided by a MAJCOM/base, performing
quality assurance, and updating the PAVER pavement management system and applicable
reference documents.
7.2. Reference Documents. Condition surveys and reports are accomplished in accordance
with the most current version of the following documents:
   7.2.1. ASTM D5340 and UFC 3-260-16FA, Airfield Condition Survey Procedures.
   7.2.2. ASTM D6433, Standard Practice for Roads and Parking Lots Pavement Condition
   Index Surveys.
   7.2.3. ASTM E1926, Standard Practice for Computing International Roughness Index of
   Roads from Longitudinal Profile Measurements.
7.3. Contract Procedure. AFCEC provides an on-call service for accomplishing condition
surveys by contract. The MAJCOM/base requiring a condition survey provides AFCEC with the
name of the base, the pavements to be surveyed (airfield, roads, or parking lots), and the current
base point of contact. If the pavements have not been surveyed previously, or if significant
changes have occurred since the last evaluation, the MAJCOM/base (customer) also provides the
area of the pavements to be surveyed. The customer also identifies any special requests, such as
development of DD Form 1391, “FY___ Military Construction Project Data” for pavement
projects or use of automated procedures for road surveys. AFCEC develops the statement of
work and government cost estimate for review by the customer. After receiving funding from the
base or MAJCOM, the AFCEC program manager (PM) works with the contracting officer to
award a task order under a pre-negotiated contract. The PM works with both the customer and
the contractor to ensure that the contractor has the latest structural pavement evaluation data and
other required information. AFCEC reviews the preliminary report for technical and contractual
adequacy and works with the contractor, MAJCOM, and base to reconcile issues, ensure that
applicable comments are incorporated, and ensure that the effort is completed within schedule.
7.4. Report Content. The statement of work outlines the content required in the report and
includes the products in the following subparagraphs, at a minimum. (Surveys conducted by
other means, i.e., in-house, Individual Mobilization Augmentees (IMAs), or Guard or Reserve
PCI teams, should contain the same products.)
   7.4.1. Field Survey Inbrief. Provide an entry briefing to the BCE project officer and other
   base officials, as arranged by the project officer. This inbrief should explain the survey
   procedures and describe the base support needed to complete the evaluation.
   7.4.2. Field Survey Outbrief. Provide an exit briefing to the BCE project officer and other
   base officials, as arranged by the project officer. This outbrief should summarize the survey
   results and provide a general impression of pavement maintenance requirements.

  7.4.3. Reports. The contractor produces a report for the airfield and/or road network. The
  current PCI report template can be found on the AFCEC Airfield Pavement Evaluation Team
  site on the Air Force Portal.

               PAVEMENT ENGINEERING ASSESSMENT STANDARDS

8.1. EA for Airfields. An EA is used to help prioritize or rank proposed M&R pavement
projects. The EA uses ratings of Adequate, Degraded, and Unsatisfactory to prioritize or rank the
projects. The EA can also be used to determine a numerical rating for a network, branch, or
section to assist MAJCOMs and HQ USAF in comparing and assessing airfields. Note that
criteria in this chapter are to be used only for project prioritization and are not associated
with criteria in other chapters of this document.
   8.1.1. EA Criteria. Apply the criteria in section 8.1.5 to determine or validate a
   section/branch rating of Adequate, Degraded, or Unsatisfactory.
   8.1.2. Project Priorities. Apply the criteria in section 8.1.6 to set priorities for projects on
   sections/branches within each impact rating category.
   8.1.3. Numerical Rating System. The criteria in section 8.1.8 can be used to establish a
   numerical rating for pavement systems or entire airfields to allow comparison throughout a
   MAJCOM and to assess the potential impact of projects.
   8.1.4. Rating Factors. The factors used to determine EAs or ratings are the PCI, Friction
   Index (runway pavements only), Structural Index, and Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Index
   (optional).
       8.1.4.1. PCI. The PCI is a numerical rating (on a scale of 0 to 100) determined by a
       visual pavement survey based on procedures in ASTM D5340, ASTM D6433, and UFC
       3-260-16FA. Refer to the most current version of the ASTM publications. MAJCOMs are
       responsible for conducting condition surveys to determine the PCI of a pavement.
       Surveys should be accomplished every 5 years. Currently, the surveys are accomplished
       with in-house resources or by contract, individual mobilization augmentees (IMAs), or
       Guard and Reserve units. AFI 32-1032 requires a PCI for projects submitted to
       MAJCOMs for approval.
           8.1.4.1.1. This AFI establishes a standard color code for the seven condition codes
           described in ASTM D5340 and also for a corresponding simplified PCI rating system
           used when performing EAs. The simplified rating categories of Good, Fair, and Poor
           are depicted in Figure 8.1. The PCI ratings can be displayed on color-coded airfield
           layout maps.
              8.1.4.1.2. Table 8.1 provides a more detailed description of the PCI rating
              categories and their associated distress levels and probable maintenance
              requirements. Figure 8.1 and Table 8.2 display the EA ratings and associated PCI
              values.

Table 8.1. Definition of PCI Ratings.
   Rating      Definition
               GOOD: Pavement has minor or no distresses and should require only routine
   86–100
               maintenance.
               SATISFACTORY: Pavement has scattered low-severity distresses that should
      71–85
               require only routine maintenance.
               FAIR: Pavement has a significant amount of generally low- and
      56–70    medium-severity distresses. Near-term M&R needs may range from routine to
               major.
               POOR: Pavement has low-, medium-, and high-severity distresses that probably
      41–55    cause some operational problems. Near-term M&R needs may range from
               routine up to a requirement for reconstruction.
               VERY POOR: Pavement has predominantly medium- and high-severity
      26–40    distresses that cause considerable maintenance and operational problems.
               Near-term M&R needs will be intensive in nature.
               SERIOUS: Pavement has mainly high-severity distresses that may cause
      11–25
               operational restrictions; immediate major repairs are needed.
               FAILED: Pavement deterioration has progressed to the point that safe aircraft
      0–10
               operations may no longer be possible; complete reconstruction is required.

 Unsatisfactory                     0–55
           8.1.4.2. Friction Index. AFCEC conducts tests to determine the friction characteristics
           of runways and compiles the results in a runway friction characteristics report for a given
           base. The friction values measured by approved friction testing equipment (see FAA AC
           150/5320-12C) are used to determine friction indices. This guidance assumes that all U.S.
           Air Force friction tests are conducted with either a GripTester or a Mu-Meter (three-
           wheeled trailer devices used for pavement surface friction testing). To determine friction
           indices, the runway should first be divided into 500-foot-long (152-meter-long) segments.
           The Friction Index for each segment is equal to the average friction value measured by
           GripTester or Mu-Meter tests conducted at 40 mph (65 km/h). The average for a segment
           can be taken as the average of the results from test runs conducted on each side of the
           runway centerline. Do not include friction values measured along the runway edges,
           which would be outside the expected aircraft wheel path area. The Friction Index for a
           section is equal to the Friction Index of the segment comprising the section. If the section
           is composed of more than one segment, assign the lowest of the segment friction indices
           to the section. Based on the Friction Index assigned to the section, a corresponding
           friction rating can be assigned using Table 8.3, which correlates friction indices from
           different friction measuring equipment to friction ratings. The friction ratings in Table
           8.3 are to be used to rank and compare projects and do not correspond to the
           guidance in FAA AC 150/5320-12C. As with PCI ratings, friction ratings can be
           displayed on a color-coded airfield layout map, using green for the corresponding rating
           of Good, yellow for Fair, and red for Poor. Because rubber deposits can lower the
           measured friction values, the truest measure of a pavement’s friction characteristics will
           be obtained if testing is accomplished shortly after completion of rubber removal.
           Therefore, to the maximum extent possible, friction testing should be scheduled as soon
           as possible following completion of a rubber removal project.

10. A wet runway produces a drop in friction with an increase in speed. If the runway has good texture, allowing the
    water to escape beneath the tire, then friction values will be less affected by speed. Conversely, a poorly textured
    surface will produce a larger drop in friction with an increase in speed. Friction characteristics can be further
    reduced by poor drainage due to inadequate slopes or depressions in the runway surface.

         8.1.4.3. Structural Index. The Structural Index is a ratio of Aircraft Classification
         Number to Pavement Classification Number (ACN/PCN) for a section. The ACN
         represents the impact a particular aircraft will have on the pavement. The PCN represents
         the capability of the pavement to support an aircraft. AFCEC conducts structural
         evaluations for Air Force bases and for each evaluation publishes an airfield pavement
         evaluation report containing the PCN for each pavement section. The airfield pavement
         evaluation report also contains ACN data on certain aircraft (i.e., critical aircraft from
         each of the standard aircraft group indices as defined in Chapter 4). Additional ACN data
         are available from AFCEC’s Aircraft Characteristics for Airfield Pavement Design and
         Evaluation report; USACE ETL 1110-3-394, Aircraft Characteristics for Airfield-
         Heliport Design and Evaluation; FAA AC 150/5335-5, Standardized Method of
         Reporting Airport Pavement Strength PCN; and the Pavement-Transportation Computer
         Assisted Structural Engineering (PCASE) computer program. Data from the latest
         AFCEC airfield pavement evaluation report can be used to determine the Structural Index
         and corresponding structural rating for each pavement section. (Note: Do not compute a
         Structural Index for overruns.) Different aircraft may be used to determine the ACN for
         different sections based on a base’s mission and traffic patterns. An ACN/PCN ratio less
         than 1.10 is classified as Good, a ratio between 1.10 and 1.40 is classified as Fair, and a
         ratio greater than 1.4 is classified as Poor. The structural ratings of each section can be
         displayed on a color-coded airfield layout map, using green for the corresponding rating
         of Good, yellow for Fair, and red for Poor. These ratios and ratings are to be used for
         comparison and prioritization only; they are not to be used to determine and report
         capability to support aircraft.
Note: Some airfield pavement evaluation reports contain two sets of PCN values, one for normal
conditions and one for the frost-melt or thaw-weakened period. In such instances, the Structural
Index determination should be based on the reported PCN values for normal conditions.

       8.1.4.4. FOD Index. This factor is optional because FOD is not a primary concern for
       some MAJCOMs. At certain locations, however, FOD potential is one of the primary
       factors for determining the serviceability of a pavement area. A FOD Index can be
       determined using the PCI survey data. The FOD Index is determined from the PCI
       calculated by considering only the distresses/severity levels capable of producing FOD as
       presented in Tables 8.4 and 8.5. In calculating the PCI for determining the FOD Index,
       note that a multiplier, or modification factor, of 0.6 is applied to the deduct value for
       alligator cracking, and a multiplier, or modification factor, of 4.0 is applied to the deduct
       value for joint seal damage. The FOD Index equals (100−PCIFOD) and can be calculated
       using PAVER.

       8.1.4.5. FOD Potential Rating Scale. A FOD Potential Rating scale ranging from 0 to
       100 can be used to indicate the potential for FOD problems. Figure 8.2 shows a
       numerical FOD Potential Rating scale and corresponding descriptive categories. The
       FOD Potential Rating depends on the type of aircraft using the pavement, the type of
       pavement surface (asphalt or concrete), and the FOD Index. The FOD Index and the FOD
       Potential Rating should be determined from the most current pavement condition survey.
       Relationships between FOD indices and FOD potential ratings have been developed for
       F-16, KC-135, and C-17 aircraft; Figures 8.3 and 8.4 show these relationships for asphalt
       and concrete pavements, respectively. These three aircraft were selected as a
       representative cross section in regards to engine height above the pavement surface and
       engine susceptibility to FOD (e.g., engine type, size, air flow, thrust). Table 8.6 shows the
       FOD Index ranges corresponding to the FOD Potential Ratings of Good, Fair, and Poor,
       as determined from Figures 8.3 and 8.4. Table 8.7 provides recommendations on which
       standard aircraft curve (i.e., F-16, KC-135, or C-17) to use when determining the FOD
       Potential Ratings for other aircraft. Different aircraft curves may be used to determine the
       FOD Potential Ratings for different sections based on a base’s mission and traffic
       patterns. The FOD Potential Ratings can be displayed on a color-coded airfield layout
       map, using green for the corresponding rating of Good, yellow for Fair, and red for Poor.

   8.1.5. Determining the EA. This section describes a procedure for determining the EA for
   any airfield pavement section or branch (i.e., runway, apron, or taxiway) based on four
   factors: PCI, Friction Index (runway pavements only), Structural Index, and FOD Index
   (optional).
      8.1.5.1. Step One: Determine Indices. Determine the appropriate PCI, Friction Index
      (runway pavements only), Structural Index, and FOD Index (optional) for each pavement
      section.
          8.1.5.1.1. PCI. Review the most recent airfield pavement condition survey report
          and determine the PCI for each pavement section. Conduct PCI surveys if the current
          condition is not accurately reflected in the latest airfield pavement condition survey
          report. Rate the section in accordance with Figure 8.1 and the instructions in
          paragraph 8.1.4.1.
          8.1.5.1.2. Friction Index. Review the most recent AFCEC runway friction
          characteristics report for the base to determine the skid/hydroplaning potential of
          runway pavements. Divide the runway into 500-foot-long (152-meter-long) segments
          and determine the Friction Index of each segment. Correlate the segments to
 50                                                        AFI32-1041 10 SEPTEMBER 2013


           pavement sections and determine the Friction Index for each section. Rate the
           sections in accordance with Table 8.3 and the instructions in paragraph 8.1.4.2.
           8.1.5.1.3. Structural Index. Review the latest AFCEC airfield pavement evaluation
           report for the base and determine the Structural Index of each section. When
           performing ACN/PCN calculations, use an ACN for the most critical mission aircraft
           on a given section at the aircraft’s average takeoff weight and the published PCN
           based on 50,000 passes of a C-17. (Note: Different aircraft may be used in the
           calculations for different sections, such as when a particular section is used only by
           fighter aircraft while other sections receive a mix of traffic that includes heavier
           aircraft.) Rate the section in accordance with the instructions in paragraph 8.1.4.3.
           Base engineers should consult with Base Operations to determine the critical
           mission aircraft and average takeoff weight.
           8.1.5.1.4. FOD Index (Optional). Determine the FOD Index using the PCI survey
           data. The FOD Index is determined from the PCI calculated by considering only the
           distresses/severity levels capable of producing FOD. Determine the FOD Potential
           Rating for each pavement section based on the appropriate aircraft and in accordance
           with Figures 8.3 and 8.4, Table 8.6, and the instructions in paragraph 8.1.4.4. (Note:
           Different aircraft may be used in determining the FOD Potential Ratings for different
           sections, such as when a particular section is used only for parking transport aircraft
           while other sections receive fighter aircraft.)
       8.1.5.2. Step Two: Determine EAs for Each Airfield Section. EAs of Adequate,
       Degraded, or Unsatisfactory are assigned to each airfield section based on the criteria in
       Table 8.8. All rating factors must meet the criteria; i.e., if all factors do not meet the
       criteria, the section rating is assigned based on the lowest factor rating. For example, a
       runway section would be rated Adequate only if the PCI is > 71; and the Friction Index is
       > 0.49; and the Structural Index (ACN/PCN) is less than 1.10; and the FOD Potential
       Rating is < 45.

Adequate                71–100                > 0.49*                < 1.10          0–45
Degraded                56–70               0.34–0.49*              1.10–1.40       46–60
Unsatisfactory            0–55                < 0.34*                > 1.40         61–100
*Applies to GripTester at 40 mph (65 km/h) only. For other testing equipment, use the values
corresponding to the ratings of Good, Fair, and Poor in Table 8.3.
       8.1.5.3. Step Three: Determine the EA for a Branch or Project Requirement. The
       EA can be determined for a branch or project requirement by computing the weighted
       area average PCI for the branch or project, Friction Index (runway pavements only),
       Structural Index, and FOD Potential Rating (optional) for each section and comparing the
       values to the criteria in Table 8.8. An example of computing a weighted average PCI is
AFI32-1041 10 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                       51


          shown in section 8.1.8. Table 8.9 shows an example of computing an EA for a runway,
          where Section R01A is 150 by 1000 feet (46 by 305 meters), Section R02C is 150 by
          8000 feet (46 by 2,438 meters), Section R03A is 150 by 500 feet (46 by 152 meters), and
          Section R04A is 150 by 500 feet (46 by 152 meters). Comparing the weighted values in
          Table 8.9 to the criteria in Table 8.8, the EA for the runway is Degraded, the lowest
          rating of the four factors.
Note: The weighted average Structural Index can result in a Degraded or Unsatisfactory rating
for a branch or project even though the PCI and other factors are rated Adequate. In this
situation, examine the individual Degraded section(s) to determine if they can support the
mission requirements. (Use the AGLs table in the latest AFCEC pavement evaluation report.) If
the mission requirements are met, rate the branch/project as Adequate.

          results be displayed on a color-coded airfield layout plan, with green indicating
          Adequate, yellow indicating Degraded, and red indicating Unsatisfactory sections. An
          example airfield layout plan illustrating EAs by section is shown in Figure 8.5, while EAs
          by branch (i.e., based on weighted section values) are shown in Figure 8.6.

   8.1.6. Project Prioritization. The following procedure outlines a method for objectively
   establishing priorities for projects that fall into the same assessment category (i.e., Adequate,
   Degraded, or Unsatisfactory).
      8.1.6.1. Procedure. Determine the PCI, Friction Index, Structural Index, and FOD
      Potential Rating (optional) for the section related to each project. Use Figure 8.7 to
      determine the deduct values for the Friction Index, Structural Index, and FOD Potential
      Rating (optional). Friction deduct charts are shown for both the Mu-Meter and the
      GripTester. These deduct values may be capped at a maximum value of 10 for data that
AFI32-1041 10 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                              53


      falls outside the ranges of values depicted. Subtract each deduct value from the PCI to
      determine a priority order (lowest numerical result ranks first in priority).
      8.1.6.2. Example. Assume that three runway sections fall within the Degraded category
      as determined by the criteria in Table 8.8. Pertinent information for determining the
      section project prioritization for this example is shown in Table 8.10.

  R13A        56−7−2−6 = 41
The priority for funding is R12A, then R13A, then R11A.

   8.1.7. Combining . When sections are combined to form projects, use an area-weighted
   process for determining the rating. For instance, if Sections R12A and R13A in Table 8.10
   were included in a single project, the combined rating would be:
      Rating (Combined) = Rating R12A(Area R12A) + Rating R13A(Area R13A)
                                       Area R12A + Area R13A
   8.1.8. Numerical Rating System. Some MAJCOMs may want to rate the general “health”
   of all facilities, including pavements, on a numerical rating scale. This section describes a
   procedure for calculating a pavement rating using a weighted PCI. A weighted PCI can be
   calculated manually or by using PAVER:
        8.1.8.1. Assume a 10,000- by 150-foot (3,048- by 46-meter) runway comprised of the
        sections described in Table 8.11.

Table 8.11. Numerical Rating System Example.
Section         Dimensions                                      PCI
R21A            1,000 by 150 feet (305 by 46 meters)            78
R22C            8,000 by 150 feet (2,438 by 46 meters)          70
R23A            500 by 150 feet (152 by 46 meters)              54
R24A            500 by 150 feet (152 by 46 meters)              52
        8.1.8.2. The manual computation:
Weighted PCI =
R21A PCI(R21A Area) + R22C PCI(R22C Area) + R23A PCI(R23A Area) + R24A PCI(R24A Area)
                     R21A Area + R22C Area + R23A Area + R24A Area

Weighted PCI =78(1000×150) + 70(8000×150) + 54(500×150) + 52(500×150)
                   (1000×150) + (8000×150) + (500×150) + (500×150)

Weighted PCI = 69 = health of runway
   8.1.9. Assessing Value Added. The procedure above can also be used to determine “value
   added” to a facility by a project. For example, assume an M&R project raises the PCI of
   R23A and R24A to 80 without affecting any of the other indices. The new rating for the
   runway would be 71.8; therefore, the project increased the health of the runway by 2.8
   points.
   8.1.10. Rating Scales. A MAJCOM may want to use a different scale for rating facility
   health. For example, using a range of 85 to 100 for the rating of Good may be desirable. This
   can be accomplished by applying a proportioning operation to the weighted PCI (see Table
   8.12).
AFI32-1041 10 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                 55

8.2. EA for Roads and Parking Lots. The factor used to determine the EA for roads and
vehicular parking lots is the PCI as determined by ASTM D6433. The criteria for determining
the EA are shown in Table 8.13 and depicted in Figure 8.8; use these criteria to determine an EA
for each section.

  paragraphs 8.1.7, 8.1.8, and 8.1.9.
  8.2.2. Project Prioritization. The PCI is used to establish the priority for projects that fall
  into the same engineering assessment category (Adequate, Degraded, or Unsatisfactory);
  however, projects for primary roads should be ranked higher than those for parking lots and
  secondary roads. See the AF Transportation AMP and Chapter 9 for Key Performance
  Indicators for roads and pavements.
AFI32-1041 10 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                      57

                                    ASSET MANAGEMENT

9.1. Background. The Air Force has established a goal to reduce the amount of infrastructure
that requires funds in accordance with AFPD 32-10. AFPD 32-10 states “Provide and retain the
minimum number of installations and facilities necessary to effectively support Air Force
missions and people at the lowest life-cycle cost and in a sustainable way. The Air Force will
inactivate or dispose of installations and facilities that are excess to requirements.” To
accomplish this goal, a procedure was developed to determine the funding required to maintain
essential infrastructure at a prescribed level of service at the lowest possible cost. Infrastructure
was divided into five activities: transportation networks, utilities, facilities, waste management,
and natural infrastructure. The transportation networks include airfield and roadway pavements,
vehicle parking areas, curbs and gutters, drainage structures, culverts, bridges, sidewalks,
markings, traffic signals, signs, lighting, rails, docks, piers, entry points, snow and ice removal,
and sweeping.
9.2. Activity Management Plan (AMP). AMPs are developed for each major CE activity to
include Airfield and Transportation Networks. AMPs include information on Real Property
inventory, Levels of Service (LOS), Key Performance Indicators (KPI), and the planned
investments (projects/requirements) identified to achieve the required LOS. This chapter outlines
the criteria for airfield, road, and parking lot pavements. To more accurately establish
requirements, each of these areas is divided into primary, secondary, and tertiary pavements as
defined in sections 9.3.1 and 9.3.2. Strict implementation of these rankings is critical to the
ability to stratify and prioritize requirements.
Note: LOS and KPI criteria are evolving and are subject to revision. Consult the current
AF Transportation Network AMP for the latest revisions.
9.3 Level of Service. The LOS for airfield, road, and parking lot pavements is the same—to
provide pavements that will support the Air Force mission by balancing risk to operations with
resource constraints.
   9.3.1. Airfield Pavements.
       9.3.1.1. Primary Pavements. Primary pavements are mission-essential pavements such
       as runways, parallel taxiways, main parking aprons, arm-disarm pads, alert aircraft
       pavements, and overruns (when used as a taxiway or for takeoff). In general, only
       pavements that have aircraft use on a daily basis or frequently used transient taxiways
       and parking areas are considered primary.
       9.3.1.2. Secondary Pavements. Secondary pavements are mission-essential but
       occasional-use airfield pavements, including ladder taxiways, infrequently used transient
       taxiway and parking areas, overflow parking areas, and overruns (when there is an
       aircraft arresting system present). In general, any pavements that do not have daily use
       by aircraft are secondary.
       9.3.1.3. Tertiary Pavements. Tertiary pavements include pavements used by towed or
       light aircraft, such as maintenance hangar access aprons, aero club parking, wash racks,
       and overruns (when not used as a taxiway or to test aircraft arresting gear). Paved
       shoulders are classified as tertiary. In general, any pavement that does not support
 58                                                         AFI32-1041 10 SEPTEMBER 2013


      aircraft taxiing under their own power or is used only intermittently is considered a
      tertiary pavement.
      9.3.1.4. Unused Pavements. Unused pavements include any pavements that are
      abandoned or scheduled for demolition.
   9.3.2. Roads and Vehicle Parking Areas. Surface Deployment and Distribution Command
   (SDDC) traffic engineering pubs and HQ USAF/LEEVX Base Comprehensive Planning
   Transportation Planning Bulletin define several categories of roads including; interstate
   (limited access), arterials, collectors, and local streets (see Figure 9.1). In general, these
   categories align with pavement rank. There may be instances where the mission may dictate
   a higher priority as defined below.

Figure 9.1. Characteristics of Roadway Classes.




      9.3.2.1. Primary Pavements. Primary pavements include arterials which are defined as
      a class of street serving a major movement of traffic not served by a freeway. This
      includes installation roads and streets that serve as the main distributing arteries for
      traffic originating outside and within an installation and that provide access to, through,
      and between the various functional areas or collector or local streets that service mission
      critical facilities. Classification of vehicle parking areas as primary pavements should be
      restricted to those areas associated with access to mission-essential facilities, such as alert
      facilities, munitions facilities, and medical facilities.
      9.3.2.2. Secondary Pavements. Secondary pavements include collector streets that
      gather and disperse traffic between the larger arterial highways and less important streets,
AFI32-1041 10 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                    59


       that have intersections at grade, and that are equally important in providing traffic
       movement and access to abutting properties. In addition, most parking areas that support
       daily traffic on a base are considered secondary pavements, unless a specific mission
       dictates otherwise.
       9.3.2.3. Tertiary Pavements. Tertiary pavements include local streets that are streets or
       roads primarily for access to residence, business or other abutting property. Installation
       roads and streets that provide access from other collector roads and streets to individual
       units of facilities of a functional area are included in this category. Unsurfaced roads and
       abandoned in-place but usable roads are classified as tertiary. Any parking area that is
       not used on a daily basis or is excess to the standard facilities requirements is considered
       a tertiary pavement.
       9.3.2.4. Unused Pavements. Unused pavements include any pavements that are
       abandoned or scheduled for demolition.
9.4. Key Performance Indicators. The criteria in this section were established to ensure that
airfield, road, and parking lot pavements LOS are adequately maintained. The four key
performance indicators are PCI, FOD Index, Friction, and Structural capability. The targets for
these four key performance indicators are used to define risk factors shown in tables 9.1 and 9.2.
These risk factors in combination with knowledge of the mission requirements are used to
manage the assets and activities to minimize the life cycle cost and risk to the mission.
   9.4.1. Airfield Pavements. Asset management pavement criteria for airfield pavements are
   shown in Table 9.1.
       9.4.1.1. Risk Factors. Airfield pavements can be maintained at one of the four Risk
       Factors shown in Table 9.1 and discussed in the following subparagraphs.
           9.4.1.1.1. Low Risk. This is the optimum condition to minimize risk to mission and
           life cycle cost. Localized or global preventive maintenance may be required to reduce
           the rate of deterioration and extend pavement life.
           9.4.1.1.2. Moderate Risk. This condition is less than optimum based on the life
           cycle cost to maintain the pavement and may have minor impact on mission
           requirements. Localized repair or localized/global preventive maintenance is needed.
           Increased FOD inspection and sweeping frequency may be required to minimize FOD
           potential.
           9.4.1.1.3. Significant Risk. This condition is not based on the life cycle cost to
           maintain the pavement. Pavements maintained at this level will require increased
           monitoring and sweeping, etc., to reduce FOD and mitigate risk to mission.
           Preventative maintenance and repairs are required to maintain operational safety.
           Some workarounds may be required to meet mission requirements. Expect mission
           restrictions.
           9.4.1.1.4. High Risk. Pavements in this condition require increased monitoring,
           sweeping and maintenance. Aircraft maintainers will need to increase monitoring of
           tires and FOD. Some aircraft ground movements may need to be rerouted.
           Continuous workarounds may be required to meet mission requirements. Expect
           urgent unscheduled M&R. Major M&R/rehabilitation needed to improve pavement
 60                                                        AFI32-1041 10 SEPTEMBER 2013


           condition. Expect mission restrictions. Pavements below this condition will likely
           require waivers to support AMC mission aircraft. Expect major delays due to repair
           times when pavement fall below this condition.
           9.4.1.1.5. General. The following subparagraphs provide general M&R and
           reconstruction guidance. A project should be programmed before the pavement
           reaches these conditions.
              9.4.1.1.5.1. Sections with a PCI greater than or equal to 71 generally require
              preventative maintenance and minor repair.
              9.4.1.1.5.2. Sections with a PCI of 56 to 70 generally require major and minor
              M&R.
              9.4.1.1.5.3. Sections with a PCI of 41 to 55 require major and minor M&R or
              reconstruction.
              9.4.1.1.5.4. Sections with a PCI of 26 to 40 require major repair or
              reconstruction.
              9.4.1.1.5.5. Sections with a PCI less than or equal to 25 require reconstruction.

      9.4.1.2. Runway Friction Requirements. If measured coefficient of friction is less than
      0.53 (based on Griptester at 40 mph) and less than 0.36 (based on Griptester at 40 mph)
      for any two consecutive 500-foot (152-meter) segments, determine the cause(s) and
      extent of the friction loss and take appropriate corrective action. Corrective action may
      consist of improving texture, grooving, restoring transverse slope, or removing rubber on
      a recurring basis. If the measured coefficient of friction is less than 0.43, issue a Notice to
      Airmen (NOTAM) and immediately improve friction characteristics.
      9.4.1.3. FOD Potential Rating. The FOD Potential Rating is discussed in paragraph
      8.1.4.5.
      9.4.1.4. Condition Surveys. Condition surveys are usually not performed on paved
      shoulders. In addition, there is currently no standard condition survey procedure for
      double bituminous surface treatment (DBST). A rating of GOOD, FAIR, or POOR is
      assigned based on a cursory visual survey using the cursory PCI procedure for shoulders
      and the simplified PCI scale. Ratings for DBST overruns are based on a determination of
      whether the DBST is preventing moisture from entering the base material from the
      surface.
      9.4.1.5. Structural. See Figure 4.1 for pass intensity levels. PCNs for the Navy and
      Army are based on the projected passes of the critical mission aircraft for the specific
      base for a 20-year life. PCNs for the Air Force are based on 50,000 passes of the C-17.
   9.4.2. Roads and Vehicle Parking Areas. Risk Factor for roads and vehicle parking areas
   is provided in Table 9.2.

   9.4.2.1. General. Pavement requirements shall be identified in the out year POM (as part of
   the AMP process) to ensure pavements are maintained IAW criteria in Tables 9.1 and 9.2. A
   project must be programmed and prioritized in the upcoming budget year before sections
   reach the following condition:
          9.4.2.1.1. Sections with a PCI greater than or equal to 71 generally require
          preventative maintenance and minor repair.
          9.4.2.1.2. Sections with a PCI of 56 to 70 generally require major and minor M&R.
          9.4.2.1.3. Sections with a PCI of 41 to 55 require major and minor M&R or
          reconstruction.
          9.4.2.1.4. Sections with a PCI of 26 to 40 require major repair or reconstruction.
          9.4.2.1.5. Sections with a PCI less than or equal to 25 require reconstruction.
