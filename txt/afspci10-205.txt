                                      INTRODUCTION

1.1. Introduction. This instruction defines the AFSPC Operational Transition Process
necessary to gain operational acceptance from the Commander, Air Force Space Command
(AFSPC/CC) or his/her delegated authority, ensuring systems and capabilities meet operational
requirements and have the necessary support elements required to support mission execution.
The Operational Transition Process integrates with milestone decisions made in the life cycle
management process, shown in Figure 2.1., and aligns with the Air Force Materiel Fielding
Process outlined in AFI 63-101/20-101, Integrated Life Cycle Management, Air Force Pamphlet
(AFPAM) 63-128, Guide to Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle Management, and
AFI 63-131, Modification Management. To achieve operational acceptance of new capabilities
and system modifications: (1) necessary resources and support (e.g., verified technical orders,
sustainment funding, training, simulators, manpower, required mission spares, etc.) must be in
place, (2) Operational Acceptance (OA), Initial Operational Capability (IOC), and Full
Operational Capability (FOC) criteria and specific organizational responsibilities must be
defined; and (3) operational risks allowing authorities to make informed decisions regarding the
OA of new capabilities and system modifications identified. This document is not intended to
duplicate information contained in other instructions (Department of Defense [DoD], United
States Strategic Command [USSTRATCOM], Air Force [AF], Headquarters Air Force Space
Command [HQ AFSPC]) except in those situations where amplification is required. Waivers
and requests for clarification and guidance for this instruction will be forwarded through
appropriate channels to HQ AFSPC/A3X.
1.2. Lead MAJCOM for Space and Cyberspace. As the Lead Major Command (MAJCOM)
for space and cyberspace, HQ AFSPC organizes, trains, and equips space and cyberspace forces
to present to Combatant Commands (CCMDs). Additionally, HQ AFSPC provides strategic
planning direction, operational concepts, and requirements to the designated Program
Management Offices (PMO) and the Science and Technology (S&T) communities to obtain new
capabilities. This instruction establishes clear and consistent roles and responsibilities for
HQ AFSPC, operating units, and other stakeholder organizations in terms of Operational
Acceptance (OA) and the Operational Transition Process. Finally, this instruction describes the
path for migrating existing cyberspace weapon systems into this normalized Operational
Transition Process.

                         OPERATIONAL TRANSITION PROCESS

2.1. Operational Transition Process. The Operational Transition Process is the formal process
by which AFSPC/CC accepts delivery of new capabilities or modifications of fielded systems
through a decision defined as OA. The execution of the Operational Transition Process for
AFSPC mission capabilities is driven by a number of events which can occur in a system’s life
cycle. These events include, but are not limited to delivery of: 1) a new system or subsystem;
2) an additional article or capability integrated into an existing system or family of systems; and
3) a modification to a sustained mission system that changes the form, fit, function, or interface
in accordance with IAW AFI 63-131. The deployment of space and cyberspace capabilities
requires maximum flexibility in this process to allow for customized solutions that can be
developed, tested, and deployed rapidly (e.g., hours or days). For example, disruptive or
innovative technologies can change the way cyberspace operations are conducted and may create
game-changing effects that dictate the course of events in our favor. Transition Process permits
flexibility to integrate and normalize these capabilities into operations within operationally-
relevant timelines. The AFSPC/CC, as the OA Approval Authority for AFSPC, has authority to
declare systems and capabilities ready for operational use. This authority may be delegated as
described in Table 1, paragraph 2.4. By conferring an OA decision, AFSPC/CC declares the new
capability or modification of a fielded system is able to support its operational mission. OA will
normally occur once the Program Executive Officer (PEO) has certified the system, if required,
and after developmental and operational testing is complete and mission-impacting deficiencies
are fixed or mitigated. The appropriate division within HQ AFSPC/A3 will orchestrate all
necessary plans and documentation with stakeholders for AFSPC/CC or the delegated OA
Approval Authority. Chapter 4 provides a high level description of the steps in the Operational
Transition Process.
2.2. Operational Transition Process Relationship to the Program Life Cycle. The
Operational Transition Process is described by activities within the Operational Transition
Timeline, shown in Figure 2.1. The Operational Transition Timeline is a possible scenario that
can be tailored depending on the needs or unique requirements of a program or modification.
HQ AFSPC and other stakeholders use the Operational Transition Process to migrate systems,
capabilities, and modifications from development stages through the OA decision. At a
minimum, the program office, test agencies, operational units and HQ AFSPC directorates must
be involved in this effort.

Figure 2.1. Operational Transition Timeline




     2.2.1. The Program Manager (PM) is responsible for developing the Materiel Fielding Plan
     (MFP) IAW AFI 63-101 to support the Operational Transition Processes and OA decision.
     The MFP documents materiel fielding related requirements, methodologies, schedules,
     organizational responsibilities and actions to be executed in advance of defined operational
     fielding dates. The initial MFP is completed prior to Milestone-B and is updated prior to
     Milestone-C. For tailored programs entering at Milestone-C, the MFP is part of the
     milestone exit criteria. The PM signs the MFP after coordination with AFSPC Directorates
     (A1, A2, A3, A4/7, A5, A6 and A8/9) and responsible Numbered Air Force (NAF). For
     modifications to existing systems, the PM will develop a fielding strategy to describe how
     the modification will be deployed for operational use.
     2.2.2. The purpose of Initial Operational Capability (IOC) and Full Operational Capability
     (FOC) declarations are to approve new acquisitions to operate partially or completely as
     defined in approved requirement documents. IOC and FOC definitions also aid the
     acquisition community in prioritizing the requirements. For new capabilities, IOC and FOC
     criteria are defined in a program’s Capability Development Document (CDD), Capability
     Production Document (CPD) or other applicable requirements documents as part of the
     normal acquisition process. Operational Acceptance criteria to be considered in conjunction
     with formally-documented IOC and/or FOC criteria are listed in Attachment 2. This list is
     not all inclusive and must be tailored to each specific program.
        2.2.2.1. Various organizations and communities (e.g., acquirers) use terms such as early
        acceptance/use, preliminary IOC/use, one-time use, and turnover. These terms are not
        defined in this AFSPCI and no attempt is made to address their unique applications or
        definitions in this instruction. For the development of Major Automated Information
        Systems (MAIS), PMs often use the term Full Deployment (FD). In most cases, the
        terms FD and FOC have the same meaning, (e.g., when the system is fully deployed, it
        should achieve FOC). Full Deployment is defined as the fielding of an increment of the
        program in accordance with the terms of a Full Deployment Decision (FDD),
        documented in an Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM).
        2.2.2.2. In some instances, IOC may occur simultaneously with FOC, especially with
        one-of-a-kind systems; however, FOC typically occurs later in the life cycle of a
        program. This is especially true if the program involves bringing a number of like assets
        on-line (e.g., satellite constellations).
AFSPCI10-205 10 DECEMBER 2013                                                                   7


       2.2.2.3. A distinct difference exists between OA decision and IOC/FOC declaration. An
       OA decision can feasibly be made any time after Milestone-C or during a non-ACAT
       system modification effort. IOC/FOC decision points are achieved when the established
       criteria in requirements documents (or other approved documentation) have been satisfied
       or accepted.
   2.2.3. HQ AFSPC is normalizing cyberspace weapon systems through a deliberate and
   tailored operational acceptance plan that leads to IOC and then FOC. HQ AFSPC/A3 and 24
   AF/CC have agreed on the prioritized sequence of cyberspace weapon systems for this effort.
   This process establishes the weapon system baseline architecture and capabilities that enable
   subsequent OA Plans/decisions for modification actions. The AFSPC Weapon System
   Teams (WSTs) are the central mechanism for these transition efforts, consistent with the
   HQ AFSPC/A3-approved WST charters.
2.3. Operational Acceptance Plan. The OA Plan is AFSPC’s supplement to the Program MFP
or fielding strategy for system modifications that details the specific actions, timelines, and
organizational responsibilities necessary to accept the capability or system modification from the
acquirer and employ it as an operational capability. The OA Plan will complement, but not
duplicate, the MFP by providing supplemental data to support successful operational transition.
The OA plan and OA criteria must consider and account for DOTMLPF for the
system/capability. The initial OA Plan for all Acquisition Category (ACAT) programs will be
completed prior to Milestone-B in synchronization with and agreement of the MFP. The initial
OA Plan for modifications will be completed by the Critical Design Review or equivalent event
and synchronized with fielding strategy documentation. The OA Plan orchestrates AFSPC and
other stakeholders’ activities.       Responsibility for writing the plan resides with the
HQ AFSPC/A3 Division with the overall responsibility for the capability. The designated
HQ AFSPC/A3 Division will update the OA Plan when significant change to the development,
fielding, or sustainment of the program or system impacts the ability to execute the plan. The
OA Plan is coordinated and approved at the level commensurate with the OA Approval
Authority described in Table 2.1. HQ AFSPC/A3 coordination will include the PEO or PMO,
appropriate AFSPC Directorates, and the responsible NAF. In the event no MFP or fielding
strategy exists, the OA Plan will act as the sole document describing the transition of the
capability from acquisition to operations. In these instances, HQ AFSPC/A3 will coordinate the
OA Plan with the PMO. If a mission system does not have a PMO assigned, the NAF will be
responsible for OA Plan creation, staffing, and approval. Because OA criteria, decision
parameters, risk tolerances and delivery timelines are unique for each program, the OA Plan
must be a scalable, tailorable document to address each capability or modification. The OA Plan
will be updated based on programmatic realities associated with development of new
capabilities, modifications, and the sustainment of fielded systems. The OA decision points will
be identified in the OA Plan and identify specific objectives within the program life cycle where
operational capability will be fielded. In some cases, the OA decision points will coincide with
IOC or FOC declaration. An OA Plan Template is located in Attachment 3.
   2.3.1. Systems may have numerous modifications after they are operationally accepted and
   fielded. The assigned AFSPC/A3 Division will develop OA Plans to ensure these
   modifications meet the approved OA criteria prior to presenting to the NAF or CCMD.
   2.3.2. Prior to achieving an OA decision, the OA Plans often need revision based on
   programmatic realities impacting cost, schedule, performance, and risk management
 8                                                        AFSPCI10-205 10 DECEMBER 2013


     activities throughout the program’s life cycle. The OA Plans will be reviewed and updated at
     least annually and to ensure they are synchronized with changes to the MFP or fielding
     strategy.
2.4. Operational Acceptance Decision. The OA decision is the point where the OA Approval
Authority accepts or rejects the capabilities or modifications presented. Following OA, the PM
officially transfers responsibility HQ AFSPC/A3. The OA decisions may be executed by the OA
Approval Authority multiple times within a program’s life cycle depending on the unique
delivery schedule of capability or the modifications of a fielded system. For example, the launch
of an additional satellite into an existing constellation (e.g., GPS satellite) may drive an
operational acceptance decision for use of that particular asset. However, a single OA decision
may be required to approve transition of a capability along with declaration of IOC or FOC.
     2.4.1. The OA Approval Authority determines if new capabilities or modifications to fielded
     systems have achieved acceptable reliability and dependability levels and account for the
     supporting resources identified in the fielding documentation necessary to support the
     transition to operations. The OA decision is made at the appropriate level based on
     standardized delegation determination factors listed in Table 2.1. For capability and
     sustainment modifications impacting form, fit, function or interface (F3I) as described in
     AFI 63-131, an OA decision is required. Any maintenance actions not impacting F3I and/or
     not requiring the use of an AF Form 1067, Modification Proposal, will not require an OA
     decision and can be implemented with NAF, wing, or unit level approval. An OA decision
     brings a level of risk that must be considered when determining if, when and to whom OA
     authority will be delegated. Table 2.1. depicts the OA Approval Authority for designated
     ACAT program levels, system delivery, and other associated modification activities for
     AFSPC fielded systems. These definitions provide general guidelines for determining the
     OA Approval Authority; however, any operational acceptance decision can be retained at any
     higher level or delegated to a lower level based on leadership determination.

       disposition of any deficiencies identified during testing or trial period. In addition, the
       PMO will ensure they have the ability to provide required support necessary to conduct
       long-term operations.
       2.4.2.2. The OA decision is the point where either the acquirer or the PMO transfers
       capability or system modification to HQ AFSPC/A3 for the new capability or system
       modification. Following OA, operations and maintenance (3400) funds provided by
       HQ AFSPC will be used for daily operations and sustainment. Additionally, the PMO
       will continue to acquire capabilities using procurement (e.g., 3080) funding and develop
       capabilities using Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) (3600) funds.
2.5. Rapid Acquisition. Certain capability development efforts (e.g., Joint Urgent Operational
Needs (JUON), Joint Capability Technical Demonstrations (JCTD), one-of-a-kind, etc.) follow
rapid acquisition processes depending on the need of the requesting user. These processes
follow tailored acquisition activities requiring the need to execute the Operational Transition
Process in a compressed/modified timeline to ensure capabilities can be successfully fielded with
required support and acceptable risk. Rapid acquisition processes are defined in the Joint
Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) Manual and DoDI 5000.02. In these
special cases, acquisition and operational organizations will strive to meet requirements within
the AFSPC Operational Transition Processes. HQ AFSPC/A3 is the approval authority for
waivers and required tailoring of these processes to address rapid acquisition efforts.
2.6. Real-Time Operations and Innovation (RTO&I). RTO&I process enables the
development and fielding of capabilities addressing critical cyber needs at the fastest possible
pace. This rapid deployment of capabilities requires a dynamic, agile, risk-based approach that
balances needs against operational risks and threats and considers opportunities for emerging
technologies. RTO&I activities, limitations, processes, and authorities are governed by other
instructions. Notably, the approval authority to accept RTO&I capabilities for presentation to
CCMD or other DoD and government organizations is the Commander, 24th Air Force (24
AF/CC); however, any cyber capabilities requiring Research and Development (R&D) shall be
managed by HQ AFSPC/A5X. If RTO&I process is used, acquisition responsibilities are
documented by the 24th AF with the PMO IAW DoDI 5000.02.
2.7. Incremental or Evolutionary Acquisition. In the event of incremental or evolutionary
acquisition, the responsible HQ AFSPC/A3 Division will tailor the OA process to allow for
incremental OA decision points and ensure that OA decisions apply to the current capability
increment.
2.8. Configuration Control. Units will only use HQ AFSPC/A5 approved architecture
(hardware, software and comm.) for operations in support of their approved missions as outlined
in their Designed Operational Capability (DOC) statements. Units will not install or use any
equipment not approved by the HQ AFSPC OA Approval Authority or an approved AF Form
1067. All requests for new capabilities, upgrades, and modifications will use the AF Form 1067
and comply with the AFI 63-131, Modification Management Process.
   2.8.1. Units will comply with essential OA requirements associated with designated
   ITW/AA systems and follow procedures IAW North American Aerospace Defense
   Command (NORAD) Instruction (NI) 10-3, Mission Integrity, Change Control Management
   and Test Control for the Integrated Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (ITW/AA)
   System, and United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) Instruction (SI) 534-22,

   Mission Integrity, Change Control Management, and Test Control for the Integrated Tactical
   Warning and Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) System, for system integrity, configuration
   management, change control, and modifications.
   2.8.2. Normalization of existing operational cyberspace weapon systems into the operational
   transition process will occur in stages involving manpower intensive efforts of all key
   stakeholder organizations. Configuration control for cyberspace weapon systems that do not
   currently have mission architecture documented and approved by HQ AFSPC will begin to
   normalize in tandem with PMO declaration and stand-up (IAW AFMC Transition Support
   Plan (TSP) for cyberspace weapon systems).
2.9. Satellite Control Authority (SCA). SCA is the authority to command and control the
spacecraft and transfers at key points during the life cycle of the vehicle. The PMO has initial
SCA, which it transfers to the operational community at a pre-determined time in the system life
cycle. SCA is transferred, via an AFSPC/CC Commander Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR)
Fragmentary Order (FRAGO), from the PMO to USSTRATCOM, who delegates SCA to Joint
Functional Component Command –Space (JFCC SPACE) for those systems that JFCC SPACE
has Tactical Control (TACON). JFCC SPACE, in turn, transfers SCA to the appropriate Space
Wing. For day-to-day operations, SCA is further delegated down to the squadron level. The
initial SCA transfer can occur as early as vehicle separation from booster (e.g., Global
Positioning System) or as late as the vehicle being placed into operational orbit (e.g., Wideband
Global SATCOM).

                     OPERATIONAL TRANSITION PROCESS STEPS

4.1. Operational Transition Process. The Operational Transition Process shown in Figure 4.1
provides a high level overview of the steps to transition a capability from the acquisition process
to operations or to accept the modification of an existing system for operational use. Figure 4.1
depicts a typical Operational Transition Process from OT&E through Trial Period (TP) to an OA
decision; however, some systems based on their unique OA Plan may eliminate and/or combine
steps (e.g., TP and OT&E) prior to the OA decision point. In select cases, these processes can be
condensed or accomplished in parallel to dramatically reduce OA timelines. The intent of the
process is to assess the readiness of the system for use in operations.

Figure 4.1. Operational Transition Process




4.2. Operational Transition Process Products. The Operational Transition Process requires
the development of various products to provide leadership the necessary background and
information to make informed decisions whether to move a capability or modification to the next
stage of the process.
   4.2.1. The Operational Acceptance Plan (OA Plan) is a tailored plan which documents the
   unique OA requirements for the new capability or system modification being implemented.
   Ideally, the OA Plan is developed prior to Milestone-B or system modification acceptance
   (Part V signature) and is updated periodically to remain in synchronization with the MFP or
   fielding strategy. Depending on the complexity of the effort, the OA Plan required for a
   capability or modification may be as simple as a single page memo, or for major system
   acquisitions, may require a complex, comprehensive plan.                    HQ AFSPC/A3I or
   HQ AFSPC/A3S, depending on the supported mission, along with appropriate stakeholders,
   will create the OA Plan to address specific criteria (e.g., TP entry and exit), timelines, and
   decision points necessary for the transition of the new capability or modification to
   operational use. The OA plan will avoid repeating information documented in the MFP,
   other fielding plans, or agreements unless it is of benefit, such as offering further clarification
   or details necessary to support the decision determination of the OA Approval Authority.
 16                                                      AFSPCI10-205 10 DECEMBER 2013


   4.2.2. The Operational Acceptance Decision Brief (OA Decision Brief) is the responsibility
   of the assigned HQ AFSPC/A3 Division with support and coordination from other relevant
   stakeholders. The OA Decision Brief provides the OA Approval Authority relevant
   information necessary to make a decision to accept or not accept the capability or
   modification for operational use. The brief will address if and how well the criteria in the
   OA Plan were met. The OA Decision Brief will provide an OA recommendation
   (Approve/Do Not Approve) to the OA Approval Authority for the capability or modification
   being considered. Supporting information regarding test findings, outstanding deficiencies,
   TP results, and other applicable data will be included in the brief as substantiation for the OA
   recommendation. HQ AFSPC/A3X will maintain and update templates for the OA Decision
   Brief.
4.3. Operational Transition Process Decision Points. The Operational Transition Process
involves a number of decision points which provide the opportunity for the designated OA
Approval Authority and the various stakeholders to review and evaluate system or capability
performance prior to an OA decision. These decision points must be completed to gain approval
to move the new capability or modification forward to the next step or return to a previous step
in the Operational Transition Process for further development, test, or evaluation as determined
by the OA Approval Authority.
   4.3.1. Trial Period (TP). TP normally occurs after operational test and evaluation, during
   which an operating organization becomes familiar with a system using operational
   techniques and procedures. TP is the final evaluation step prior to OA. The system or
   capability will be used in an operational configuration with sufficient operational safeguard
   in place to prevent mission failure. When a system or capability enters trial period it is used
   to support the operational mission and is considered operational. As such, mission operators
   must have sufficient documentation and training to accomplish the mission before TP entry.
   The TP is nominally between 30 and 60 days for new systems, as short as 72 hours for a
   minor modification, and should be adjusted based on criteria and evaluation needs. In some
   cases, a TP may not occur at all if it is not feasible and operational readiness can be
   determined via other means.
       4.3.1.1. Trial Period Entry. The decision to enter TP is based on successfully meeting
       the TP entry criteria described in the OA Plan. The TP entry decision is made by the
       designated OA Approval Authority.
       4.3.1.2. Trial Period Exit. The decision, made by the OA Approval Authority, to exit TP
       is based on successfully meeting the exit criteria described in the OA Plan. This decision
       will be made in conjunction with the user with information collected from the
       performance of the new capability or system modification. Typically, TP exit criteria
       will be the same as the OA criteria and TP exit will result in an OA decision.
       Capabilities or modifications deemed not ready for OA at the scheduled TP conclusion
       will either be extended in TP or removed from TP for further development or test
       activities. For short duration TPs, a conditional approval to exit may be granted at the TP
       entry by the OA Approval Authority, contingent upon successfully meeting TP exit
       criteria.
   4.3.2. Operational Acceptance. OA is the final decision point in the Operational Transition
   Process. Once the OA Approval Authority has made the decision to OA the new capability
AFSPCI10-205 10 DECEMBER 2013                                                                17


   or system modification, it will be made available for employment by the operational users
   IAW the MFP (or fielding strategy) and OA Plan.
4.4. Operational Transition Process Steps. The Operational Transition Process is used to
transition new capabilities from acquisition to operational use or to gain the approval to use a
modification to a fielded system.
   4.4.1. New Capability. The Operational Transition Process is used to transfer new
   capabilities from acquisition to operational status. These efforts require close coordination
   and working relationships between HQ AFSPC, the acquirer, PMO, NAF, and the
   operational unit. The OA Approval Authority for these transition processes is based on the
   authority level depicted in Table 2.1 and defined in paragraph 2.4 The steps and products
   developed for the Operational Transition Process described below will be tailored to meet the
   operational need for the specific capability being transitioned to operations.
       4.4.1.1. Operational Transition Path for New Capability:

  4.4.2. System Modification. The Operational Transition Process is also used to OA
  modifications of fielded systems. These efforts require close coordination and working
  relationships between the PEO, HQ AFSPC, PMO, NAF, and the operational unit. The OA
  Acceptance Authority for these Non-ACAT modifications is based on the authority level
  depicted in Table 2.1 and defined in paragraph 2.4 The steps and products developed for the
  Operational Transition Process described below will be tailored to meet the operational need
  for the specific modification being implemented.

Terms
Acquisition—The conceptualization, initiation, design, development, testing, contracting,
production, deployment, and disposal of a directed and funded effort that provides a new,
improved, or continued materiel, weapon, information system, logistics support, or service
capability in response to an approved need.
Capability—The ability to achieve a desired effect under specified standards and conditions
through combinations of ways and means to perform a set of tasks. It is defined by an
operational user or through joint Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and
Education, Personnel, and Facilities (DOTMLPF) construct.
AFSPCI10-205 10 DECEMBER 2013                                                                   23


Deficiency—The degree of inability to successfully accomplish one or more mission tasks or
functions required to achieve mission or mission area objectives. In contract management – any
part of a proposal that fails to satisfy the government’s requirements (Defense Acquisition
Acronyms and Terms).
Deficiency Report (DR)—Report governed by TO-00-35D-54, USAF Deficiency Reporting,
Investigation, and Resolution, that documents deficiencies.
Deficiency Review Board (DRB)—The DRB provides a forum for capturing, documenting, and
discussing deficiencies encountered during the test and trial period phases of program. DRB
evaluates anomalous system behavior, assigns (or updates) a problem category and subcategory
IAW TO 00-35D-54, USAF Deficiency Reporting, Investigation, and Resolution.
Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E)—Test and evaluation conducted to evaluate
design approaches, validate analytical models, quantify contract technical performance and
manufacturing quality, measure progress in system engineering design and development,
minimize design risks, predict integrated system operational performance (effectiveness and
suitability) in the intended environment, and identify system problems (or deficiencies) to allow
for early and timely resolution.
Fielding—Occurs when supported and supporting commands collaboratively plan and execute
the delivery and bed-down of an operationally effective and suitable platform or system, or a
major system modification/upgrade, from a total system capability perspective, that is
sustainable over its planned life cycle.
Fit—Involves the manner in which an asset physically attaches to, or integrates with an adjacent
component or higher level assembly. For hardware assets, fit involves such things as mechanical
and electrical attachment points and methods (i.e., connectors, mounting trays, equipment racks,
etc.). For firmware and software assets, fit involves the manner in which computer code is
installed into its host platform, system, or subsystem.
Form—Involves the physical properties and manufacturing characteristics of an asset. For
hardware assets, form includes such things as size, shape, weight, and appearance, as well as
materiel properties, treatments, finishes, and production tolerances.
Full Operational Capability (FOC)—Full attainment of the capability to effectively employ a
weapon, item of equipment or system of approved specific characteristics, which is manned and
operated by a trained, equipped and supported military force or unit.
Function—Involves the manner in which an asset operates, performs an intended action, or
provides a designated capability.
Initial Operational Capability (IOC)—That first attainment of the capability to effectively
employ a weapon, item of equipment, or system of approved specific characteristics with the
appropriate number, type, and mix of trained and equipped personnel necessary to operate,
maintain, and support the system.
Interface—Involves the common boundary where two or more assets that converge and act
upon one another (i.e., communicate, transfer data, etc.). Interface may also include the physical,
electronic, electrical, functional, and/or the human-system integration characteristics two or more
assets must exhibit in order to create a functional system.

Life Cycle—The span of time associated with a system, subsystem, or end item that begins with
the conception and initial development of the requirement, continues through development,
acquisition, fielding, and sustainment until the time it is either consumed in use or disposed of as
being excess to all known materiel requirements.
Milestone Decision Authority (MDA)—The individual designated to approve entry of an
acquisition program into the next phase.
Milestones—Major decision points that separate the phases of an acquisition program.
Modification—For the purposes of this instruction, a modification is defined as a change to the
form, fit, function, or interface (F3I) of an in-service, configuration-managed AF asset.
Modifications are primarily defined by their purpose. A capability modification alters the F3I of
an asset in a manner that requires a change to the existing system, performance, or technical
specification of the asset. Such modifications are generally accomplished to add a new capability
or function to a system or component, or to enhance the existing technical performance or
operational effectiveness of the asset. A sustainment modification alters the F3I of an asset in a
manner that does not change the existing system, performance, or technical specification of the
asset. Such modifications are generally accomplished to correct product quality deficiencies, or
to bring the asset in compliance with, or to maintain the established technical or performance
specification(s) associated with the asset. Sustainment modifications may also include efforts
that are accomplished for the primary purpose of improving the reliability, availability,
maintainability, or supportability of an asset, or to reduce its ownership costs.
Operational Acceptance—A deliberate decision by the AFSPC/CC (or delegate) to accept
delivery of a new or modified system capability from the acquirer or developer in order to
deliver it as an operational capability for the requesting CCMD. That point in time at which
AFSPC formally accepts, for that site, responsibility and accountability for the operational and
organizational maintenance of the acquired equipment from the acquisition organization.
Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E)—Test and evaluation conducted in as realistic an
operational environment as possible to estimate the prospective system’s operational
effectiveness and operational suitability. In addition, operational test and evaluation provides
information on organization, personnel requirements, doctrine and tactics. In turn, it also
provides data to support or verify material in operating instructions, publications, and
handbooks.
Operational Transition—Formal process executed by the operational community that
culminates in an operational acceptance decision of an, or new acquisition or modification of a
fielded system ensuring they meet the minimum requirements and can efficiently, effectively,
and safely support mission operations.
Program—Systems, subsystems, end items, services, or activities on the Air Force Acquisition
Program Master List (APML), Sustainment Program Master List (SPML), weapon systems
designated in AFPD 10-9 (Lead Command Designation and Responsibilities for Weapon
Systems), or identified as Services Category activities.
Program Executive Officer (PEO)—A military or civilian official who has primary
responsibility for directing one or more Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs) and for
assigned major system and non-major system acquisition programs.
AFSPCI10-205 10 DECEMBER 2013                                                                       25


Program Manager (PM)—The DoDI 5000.02 designated individual with responsibility for and
authority to accomplish program objectives for development, production, and sustainment to
meet the user‘s operational needs. The PM for acquisition programs shall be accountable for
credible cost, schedule, performance, and materiel readiness to the MDA.
Risk—A measure of future uncertainties in achieving program performance goals within defined
cost and schedule constraints. It has three components: a future root cause, a likelihood assessed
at the present time of that future root cause occurring, and the consequence of that future
occurrence.
Risk Analysis—The activity of examining each identified risk to refine the description of the
risk, isolate the cause, and determine the effects and aiding in setting risk mitigation priorities. It
refines each risk in terms of its likelihood, its consequence, and its relationship to other risk areas
or processes.
Stakeholders—Individual or organizational entities (users, developers, acquirers, technologists,
testers, budgeters, sustainers, and industry) that are, or will be, associated with implementing and
supporting the associated system, subsystem, or end-item capability requirements.
Sustainment—Continuing materiel support which consists of the planning, programming, and
execution of a logistics support strategy for a system, subsystem, or major end item to maintain
operational capabilities from OA through disposal.
System—Any organized assembly of resources and procedures united and regulated by
interaction or interdependence to perform a set of specific functions.
