1.1. Introduction. Effective execution of a comprehensive space education and training
program is critical to develop and maintain highly skilled, experienced, and motivated space
professionals within the National Security Space (NSS) community. In 2009, the original NSSI
was realigned to appropriately place space education and training within applicable Air Force
organizations. As a result, the ASOpS and NSSI were formed. The ASOpS is part of the SIDC,
and is responsible for fundamentals, deployment and advanced training courses. Within the
SIDC, the ASOpS is assigned to the 595th Space Group. The NSSI is assigned to AETC, with
responsibility for space PCE via the Space 200 and 300 courses. The NSSI is under AU‟s Eaker
Center for Professional Development (ECPD). For simplicity, this AFSPCI refers to the schools
as ASOpS and NSSI with the understanding that space education and training matters will be
managed within respective chains of command as required.
1.2. Scope. This AFSPCI provides guidelines for effective interaction between HQ AFSPC and
external agencies regarding ASOpS and NSSI course management and development; outlines the
roles of the Course Functional Manager (CFM) and the Space Education and Training Board
(SETB); describes roles and responsibilities for key organizations; provides general guidance for
course and student management; outlines the process for requesting, developing and modifying
ASOpS courses; and describes how AFSPC integrates with AF and AETC processes to
significantly change or request new NSSI courses.
1.3. ASOpS The ASOpS presents operationally focused training courses to meet HQ AFSPC
requirements, as well as additional DoD space cadre requirements as resources permit. For
additional information, see the ASOpS website: https://www2.peterson.af.mil/ASOpS.htm
 4                                                      AFSPCI36-221 7 NOVEMBER 2011


       1.3.1. Deployment Preparation. The ASOpS is responsible for the development and
       execution of curricula to train space warfighters on the integration of space power into
       military operations. The ASOpS also conducts the Weapons School Preparatory Course
       to prepare AFSPC candidates for the USAF Weapons School program.
       1.3.2. Fundamentals. The ASOpS develops courses that provide general space education
       for the NSS community, personnel from DoD/National agencies and selected allies
       (through Foreign Military Sales (FMS)).
       1.3.3. Advanced Courses (AC). The ASOpS provides ACs to develop subject matter
       experts with technical and tactical depth in space mission areas. ACs provide in-depth
       understanding of the design, vulnerability, operation, employment and tactics of specific
       weapon systems. AC graduates return to their organizations and employ their knowledge
       to strengthen unit training programs, develop tactics, techniques and procedures, and
       influence system development and acquisition.
       1.3.4. Comparison to Combat Mission Ready (CMR) training. ASOpS courses enhance
       an individual‟s knowledge and understanding of specific subjects, but are not CMR
       courses. CMR courses are taught by AETC or AFSPC units, with HQ AFSPC/A3T
       oversight.
1.4. NSSI. The NSSI develops and executes Space 200 and 300 in support of the Air Force
Space Professional Development Program (SPDP). Courses also support space cadre
development for other services‟ and selected allies (through FMS). For additional information,
see the NSSI website: https://www2.peterson.af.mil/nssi/CESET/nssi/index.htm
1.5. Space & Cyberspace Professional Management Office (SCPMO), HQ
AFSPC/A1MH. The SCPMO is the Air Force lead for the SPDP and therefore is closely
associated with the NSSI, which executes key elements of SPDP‟s education requirements. The
SCPMO supports the AFSPC/CC‟s role as the Space Professional Functional Authority (SPFA)
and establishes AF SPDP education policy. The SCPMO also serves as the AFSPC interface on
Department of Defense (DoD) space cadre issues, synchronizing AF space cadre development
efforts, coordinating requirements for selected NSSI and ASOpS courses, and addressing space
education and advanced training needs across the NSS community.
2.1. Course Functional Manager. Each course has a CFM, the advocate with a principal
interest in course development and execution to meet mission requirements. The CFM
determines requirements for new courses; submits changes to existing courses; works closely
with the ASOpS or NSSI to effectively develop and manage their courses; and advises the SETB
on course requirements, as required.
3.1. Space Education and Training Board. The SETB is a collaborative forum that facilitates
interschool cooperation and addresses issues associated with ASOpS- and NSSI-provided space
education and training. The SETB provides a forum to consolidate tasking, assess resource
requirements, establish priorities and review metrics (para 5.6). It is the preliminary review
board for ASOpS courses during the course development process (para 6) and integrates AFSPC
requirements into AU‟s curriculum process (para 7) for NSSI courses.

5.1. Course Management. Course management involves course scheduling, student
scheduling, funding and management and metrics collection. In addition, by using AETC‟s
OTA, students receive course notifications through their Unit Training Managers and receive
credit for course completion in their official training records.
   5.1. 1. Course scheduling. Course scheduling is a dynamic process tied to space education
   and training requirements and resource availability.
          5.1.1.1. The SCPMO solicits CFM input for annual throughput or number of course
          offerings for ASOpS and NSSI courses. The actual number of courses offered in a
          FY may differ from the CFM‟s input due to resource availability and prioritization.
             5.1.1.1.1. Mobile courses. Organizations will request ASOpS mobile courses
 10                                                        AFSPCI36-221 7 NOVEMBER 2011


                through the ASOpS. The request will include the timeframe, location and desired
                content. Requesting organizations will fund ASOpS TDY costs. The ASOpS will
                assess impact (schedule, instructor availability) and determine if they are able to
                support the mobile course offering.
       5.1.2. AF space education and training requirements have priority for ASOpS and NSSI
       courses. The SCPMO forecasts space PCE throughput requirements for Active
       Duty/civilian space professionals and polls CFMs, ARC, other services and selected
       allies for ASOpS and NSSI requirements.
       5.1.3. The SCPMO consolidates all ASOpS and NSSI course requirements for SETB
       review. The SETB will review the requirements, identify any additional resource
       constraints, and validate requirements for ASOpS and NSSI to develop course schedules.
       5.1.4. The ASOpS and NSSI will schedule courses and forward schedules to the
       SCPMO; the SCPMO updates the SETB.
       5.1.5. When projected attendance for an ASOpS course is 50% or less of the target class
       size, the ASOpS will notify the CFM at least 30 days prior to class start and provide a
       recommendation on whether or not the course should proceed; the CFM will determine if
       the course will proceed. The ASOpS will notify registered students of course
       cancellation.
5.2. Student scheduling. Student scheduling varies by course. In general, the process involves
selecting students based on attendance criteria, populating class rosters and notifying students.
Student notification timelines vary based on the target audience, course length and prerequisites.
       5.2.1. ASOpS Courses. Table 5.1., Deployment / Fundamentals / Advanced Courses,
       describes the scheduling process by ASOpS course categories.

3. ASOpS may grant waivers on a case-by-case basis per CFM guidance.
4. Course announcement will include: eligibility criteria, nomination requirements and
information on the selection process
       5.2.2. NSSI, Space PCE courses. Effective student scheduling ensures the required
       number of space professionals attend space PCE. Table 5.2., Space PCE courses,
       describes the scheduling process.
            5.2.2.1. Space PCE courses are essential elements of AF SPDP. To earn SPDP
            Certification Levels, AF space professionals must attend within established eligibility
            windows. Attendance is not based on competitive selection, but on SPDP eligibility
            criteria and class slot availability. ARC space professional POCs nominate Reserve
            and Guard personnel based on eligibility and slot allocations.
            5.2.2.2. The SCPMO is responsible for class slot quotas for space PCE, which
            includes determining SPDP requirements; coordinating with the ARC and other
            services for their requirements; and balancing class slots based on requirements,
            available capacity and guidance from the SPFA. Quotas are based on Service,
            organization, personnel classification/grade (officer, enlisted, civilian, Guard,
            Reserve), Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSC) and year group.
            5.2.2.3. AF space professionals include Total Force personnel directly involved in
            fielding, launching and employing space power and subject to SPDP certification
            requirements. Core disciplines include operations (13S / 1C6), scientists (61X),

            (15W / 1W) and cyberspace operations and support (17D / 3D) as well as specified
            civilian personnel. Expansion to include additional disciplines is at the discretion of
            the SPFA.
            5.2.2.4. Space cadre offices of the other services nominate personnel to attend
            courses based on their criteria and slot allocations.

5.3. Student Funding. In-residence NSSI and ASOpS courses require TDY to Colorado
Springs, CO. Table 5.3., Student TDY Funding Guidelines, provides general rules for funding
student travel, lodging and per diem. The student notification will include instructions on fund
cite authorization and TDY orders.

NOTE:
1. Only AF members selected by HQ AFSPC/A3TW are funded by PE27603F.
2. For TDYs funded through PE84760F, the NSSI will generate orders or a Travel Authorization
and Use of Funds memorandum for students IAW their local guidelines.
3. Only applies to space professionals attending an ASOpS course for SPDP certification.
4. For TDYs funded through PE35174F, AFSPC organizations will generate orders based on
instructions that ASOpS includes in the student notification.
5.4. Student management, ASOpS. Student management ensures consistent and equitable
administration of students enrolled in ASOpS courses. The ASOpS Commander is responsible
for development and execution of student management policies. The following general
guidelines ensure the ASOpS and CFMs are consistent in dealing with student absences and
performance.
       5.4.1. Students are expected to be present for all phases of instruction during a course.
       Unauthorized absences may result in student elimination.                In extraordinary
       circumstances, authorized absences may be granted IAW ASOpS student management
       policies.
       5.4.2. Performance. The ASOpS will establish measurement criteria for courses
       consistent with the CTS and criteria requiring an elimination board. The ASOpS will
       disseminate criteria to ensure students are aware of expected performance.
          5.4.2.1. The ASOpS will maintain ongoing interaction with CFMs. At a minimum,
          the ASOpS will inform the CFM when a student will meet an elimination board. The
          ASOpS will pass results from the elimination board to the CFM and the student‟s unit
          commander.
          5.4.2.2. Students disenrolled from a course will not receive credit for course
          completion and must wait six months and obtain a recommendation from their wing
          commander (or equivalent) to re-enroll. Placement in a class will be contingent on
          slot availability. If elimination changes the student‟s eligibility, the CFM will
          determine if the student may re-enroll based on the wing commander‟s
          recommendation.
       5.4.3. Fitness standards. Due to the short duration of ASOpS courses, students are
       personally responsible for maintaining AF fitness standards; assessing compliance with
       AF fitness standards is the responsibility of the student‟s unit.
5.5. Student management, NSSI. The NSSI Commandant is responsible for student
management policies IAW AUI 36-2315, Student Disenrollment Procedures, 19 Nov 2008. The
NSSI will inform the SCPMO of disenrollment proceedings and student elimination from space
PCE.
5.6. Metrics. To maintain consistency and accurately document space education and training
throughput in both schools, ASOpS and NSSI will establish and monitor metrics for each course.
Example metrics: courses conducted, throughput, percent graduated; demographics of students
(e.g., rank, service, country). ASOpS and NSSI will submit metrics to SCPMO quarterly to meet
higher headquarter reporting requirements.
 14                                                      AFSPCI36-221 7 NOVEMBER 2011


5.7. OTA Functions. HQ AFSPC/A1KB supports ASOpS execution of OTA functions and
updates the AETC‟s ETCA website with ASOpS course information.
6.1. Developing/modifying ASOpS Curricula. The curriculum development/modification
process involves establishing and validating requirements specified in the CRD/CTS, estimating
and advocating for resources, and developing/modifying/executing the course. A requestor can
be the CFM, ASOpS or HQ AFSPC staff, the SETB, or an external organization. The process
begins with a requestor submitting a CRD to the ASOpS or SCPMO (as SETB facilitator).
       6.1.1. CRD and Major Changes. A CRD identifies the overarching requirements for a
       course. ASOpS uses the criteria for a Major Change to scope the effort to execute the
       change. A new course is processed as a Major Change.
          6.1.1.1. CRD: A CRD establishes the “what, why, who and when” and must provide
          sufficient detail to allow the ASOpS and the SETB to determine if the course is
          within the scope of the ASOpS‟s mission and establish a priority for further
          requirements definition (Reference Attachment 2, CRD Template for additional
          details).
       6.1.2. Major Change: changes to the CTS (revisions to tasks or learning levels);
       potential need for additional resources (manpower, facilities, funding); course deletions;
       and all requests to develop new courses. Other changes are assigned to the ASOpS for
       disposition.
6.2. Curriculum development/modification process.            Figure 6.1., ASOpS Curriculum
Development/Modification Process, depicts the steps for developing/modifying ASOpS
curricula. Paragraphs below discuss associated steps and decision points.
       6.2.1. CRD (Requestor). Initiates the DEVELOP phase with a CRD for a new course.
       The CRD will enter the Major Change phase to validate and prioritize the requirement.
       6.2.2. Change (Requestor). Initiates the MODIFY phase with a suggested change for an
       existing course. The MODIFY process begins with the ASOpS checking the validity of
       the change and assessing the impact to the curriculum.
       6.2.3. Change Valid (ASOpS). The ASOpS reviews the change and determines if the
       change is valid and within the scope of the course. To make this assessment, the ASOpS
       may consult with the CFM. If the change is valid, the ASOpS will determine if the
       change meets criteria for a Major Change.

   6.2.4. Major Change (ASOpS). The ASOpS determines if the change is a Major Change
   based on criteria in para 6.1.2., Major Change and informs the CFM. The ASOpS will
   provide a preliminary estimate of the expected impacts and resources required to initiate the
   change. If the change is not Major, the ASOpS implements the change based on need,
   opportunity and available resources.
       6.2.5. Develop/modify CRD/CTS (CFM, ASOpS). The CFM and ASOpS will
       develop/modify a CRD and CTS to refine course requirements (e.g., determine desired
       learning outcomes, develop line items, and specify learning levels).
       6.2.6. CRD/CTS coordination (Command Lead). The HQ AFSPC Command Lead (or
       other functional organization) reviews the course requirements in the CRD/CTS for
       courses aligned with their mission area.
       6.2.7. CRD/CTS coordination (SETB). The SETB reviews the course requirements in
       the CRD/CTS as a preliminary review board prior to obtaining HQ AFSPC/A3 approval.
       For a change to an existing course, the SETB determines if it requires HQ AFSPC/A3
       approval.
       6.2.8. Course Approved (SETB). HQ AFSPC/A3 approves the course requirements
       specified in the CRD/CTS. Approval requires the ASOpS to develop the Course
       Resource Estimate and pursue funding with validated requirements.
       6.2.9. Develop CRE (ASOpS). ASOpS develops a CRE to determine facility,
       equipment, funding and manpower required to conduct the course and submits the CRE
       to the SETB.
       6.2.10. Resources required (SETB). The SETB reviews the CRE for completeness,
       determines impact on facilities and equipment and identifies areas of concern prior to
       seeking additional resources.
       6.2.11. Advocate/provide resources (CFM, SIDC, PEM). If resources are available to
       develop/execute the course, the applicable organization will transfer funds to the SIDC
       PE (PE35174F). In most cases, new courses will require advocacy through the AFSPC
       Corporate Process. The PE35714F PEM will normally present the option and will need
       support from the CFM, ASOpS and SIDC to accurately convey required resources and
       mission impact. Command Leads may also provide critical advocacy. Once resources
       are available, the ASOpS will proceed with developing or modifying curricula.
       6.2.12. Develop or modify curricula (ASOpS). Based on the course requirements, the
       ASOpS develops or modifies the curricula and associated courseware. The CFM will
       support the development effort by reviewing course material (syllabus, lessons, etc.), as
       requested by ASOpS.
6.3. Curriculum Review. ASOpS will establish periodic curriculum reviews to assess the
adequacy of courses to meet established requirements and educational needs. In contrast to
routine course evaluations, curriculum reviews will have a strategic focus and validate existing
and future course requirements (e.g., new systems, revised strategy/doctrine). Specific review
procedures may vary by course.
       6.3.1. CFMs will coordinate with ASOpS to determine the approach for specific course
       reviews. For example, ASOpS and CFMs may conduct combined end-of-course
AFSPCI36-221 7 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                17


      feedback sessions, field interviews or course surveys; CFMs may also conduct
      independent assessments. At a minimum, ASOpS and CFMs will review course
      documentation (e.g., CRD, CTS) annually.
      6.3.2. Course change recommendations resulting from the review will follow the
      procedures in paragraph 6.1 above. The ASOpS, in coordination with the CFM, will
      report the results of the curriculum review to the SETB.
7.1. Developing/modifying NSSI Curricula. The SPFA provides overarching guidance and
direction for space PCE. Development and modification of NSSI courses follows processes
prescribed in AFI 36-2302, Professional Development (Academic Degrees and Professional
Continuing Education). The following paragraphs describe the AFSPC approach to integrate
with these processes.
      7.1.1. AF Form 19, Request to Establish a New Professional Continuing Education
      Course, and AU Major Changes. The AF Form 19 establishes the requirement,
      coordination and approval for new PCE courses. Like the CRD, the AF Form 19
      identifies the overarching need, including course description, objectives, justification,
      target audience and annual production. If a change to an existing course meets the AU
      Major Change criteria (25 percent or more hours curriculum modification or adjustment),
      the course is deleted and a new AF Form 19 is developed.
7.2. AFSPC Process for Space PCE Requirements. Figure 7.1., AFSPC Process for Space
PCE Requirements, depicts the AFSPC process for identifying requirements to AU for
developing/modifying space PCE curricula. The paragraphs below discuss associated steps and
decision points.
      7.2.1. AF Form 19 (Requestor). Initiates the DEVELOP process with an AF Form 19 for
      a new course. The AF Form 19 enters the Major Change process to validate the
      requirement.
      7.2.2. Change (Requestor). Initiates the MODIFY process with a suggested change for
      an existing PCE course. The MODIFY process begins with the NSSI checking the
      validity of the change and assessing the impact to the curriculum.
      7.2.3. Change Valid (NSSI). The NSSI reviews the change and determines if the change
      is valid and within the scope of the course. To make this assessment, the NSSI may
      consult the CFM. If the change is valid, the NSSI will determine if it is a Major Change.
      7.2.4. Major Change (NSSI). For a Major Change (para 7.1.), the NSSI will inform the
      CFM and provides a preliminary estimate of the expected impacts and resources required
      for the change. If the change is not Major, the NSSI implements the change based on
      need, opportunity and available resources.
      7.2.5. Develop/modify AF Form 19 (CFM, NSSI). The CFM and NSSI will
      develop/modify the AF Form 19 to refine course requirements (e.g., description,
      objectives, justification, etc.).
      7.2.6. AF Form 19 coordination (SETB). The SETB completes a preliminary review of
      the AF Form 19 prior to obtaining AFSPC/CV signature.
18                                                  AFSPCI36-221 7 NOVEMBER 2011


     7.2.7. AF Form 19 signed (CV). Course changes may require SPFA coordination prior
     to the AF-level AF Form 19 process. AFSPC/CV signs block 19 to initiate the AF Form
     19 process.
     7.2.8. AF Form 19 Process. The AF Form 19 is coordinated through multiple
     organizations (e.g., ECPD, AU, AETC, Air Staff) to research the requirement, estimate
     costs and approve the course. HQ AFSPC, in coordination with AU, may be required to
     advocate or provide resources for the course.

       7.2.9. Advocate/provide resources (CFM). In coordination with AU, the CFM will
       advocate for resources, as required. Course advocacy may require AFSPC support.
       7.2.10. Develop/modify Curriculum Plan (NSSI, CFM). Once approved and funded, the
       NSSI develops or modifies a Curriculum Plan to identify course objectives. The NSSI
       collaborates with the CFM to ensure the course meets requirements.
       7.2.11. Develop or modify curricula (NSSI). Based on the course requirements, the
       NSSI develops or modifies the curricula and associated courseware/documentation. The
       CFM will support the development effort by reviewing course material (syllabus, lessons,
       etc.), as requested by NSSI.
7.3. Curriculum Review. AUI 36-2306, Air University Educational Program Review,
describes AU‟s formal curriculum review process. AU-ECPD conducts a biennial review to
verify that NSSI courses contain content required by the CFM as documented in the Curriculum
Plan.
       7.3.1. Review Curriculum Plan (NSSI, CFM). The NSSI and CFM review the
       Curriculum Plan to assess course construct and objectives and provide results to the
       SETB.
       7.3.2. Curriculum Plan coordination (SETB). The SETB coordinates on the Curriculum
       Plan as a preliminary review board and provides a recommendation to AFSPC/CV for
       validation.
       7.3.3. Curriculum Plan validated (CV). AFSPC/CV validates the Curriculum Plan via a
       memo to ECPD/CC.
       7.3.4. The validated Curriculum Plan meets the AU EPRB to approve the content,
       conduct and administration of NSSI courses. In addition to the formal biennial review,
       ECPD can request out-of-cycle reviews to consider any major change involving course
       revisions, additions, or deletions occurring since the last formal review.
