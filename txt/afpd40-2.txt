SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This revision incorporates minor changes to radioactive material management policy.

1. The use of radioactive materials is beneficial, and often essential to success, in medicine, research and
development and operational activities. However, there are potential hazards associated with these sub-
stances that must be controlled to protect human health and the environment.

2. The Air Force will fully comply with all applicable federal regulations for the control of radioactive
material.

3. The Air Force will limit the use of radioactive materials as much as possible.
   3.1. Radioactive materials will only be used when justified.
2                                                                           AFPD40-2 15 MARCH 2007


    3.2. Radiation exposures to workers and the public will be maintained below federal regulatory limits
    and as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA).
    3.3. Radioactive materials will only be used on Air Force installations when properly authorized by
    an appropriate permit or license, and when approved by the installation commander.

4. Only individuals qualified by appropriate training and experience will be allowed to use, supervise the
use of, train others and oversee radiation safety programs for use of radioactive materials.

5. The Air Force will have a formal program to assess compliance with this policy, provisions of the Air
Force Master Materials License (MML) and with USAF Radioactive Material Permits.

6. The following responsibilities and authorities are established:
    6.1. AF/SG will provide policy, advocate resources for, oversee and enforce the control of radioactive
    materials in the US Air Force, under the auspices of the Air Force MML.
    6.2. The Air Force Radioisotope Committee (RIC), managed under AF/SG, functions as the Air Force
    radiation safety committee, administering the Air Force MML. It manages the Air Force use of radio-
    active materials by Air Force personnel, approving or denying such use, and enforces compliance with
    the Air Force MML.
    6.3. The Air Force Inspection Agency (AFIA), under SAF/IG, inspects unit compliance with USAF
    Radioactive Material Permits, federal regulations, and other radiation protection issues as required by
    the RIC.
    6.4. Commanders of Air Force organizations using radioactive materials will ensure only authorized
    activities are conducted, establish programs to ensure activities are safely performed and in compli-
    ance with requirements, and provide resources needed to comply with this policy.
    6.5. Individuals are responsible for effective control of radioactive materials by:
       6.5.1. Complying with radiation safety procedures, the license or permit, USAF or local instruc-
       tions and federal regulations.
       6.5.2. Following instructions or directives of the Commander, their supervisors and the Radiation
       Safety Officer (RSO).
       6.5.3. Informing the Commander, supervisor or RSO about conditions believed to be unsafe,
       non-compliant or believed to be the cause or potential cause of a radiological incident or mishap.
       6.5.4. Keeping exposures to radiation ALARA.

7. This policy applies to all Air Force organizations and employees who acquire or possess radioactive
materials subject to this regulation and to any agency or person (including contractors) who bring radio-
active materials onto Air Force installations or use radioactive materials on Air Force installations. It does
not apply to radioactive materials transferred from the Department of Energy (DOE) to the DOD as com-
ponents of nuclear weapon systems, certain radioactive components of weapons systems, nuclear reactor
systems components and fuel controlled under Section 91(a) and (b) of the AEA, as amended, and DOE
activities related to SAFE HAVEN requirements.

8. See Attachment 1 for measuring compliance with policy.

                           MEASURING COMPLIANCE WITH POLICY

A1.1. Three objective measures of overall compliance with policy are the number of incidents and mis-
haps involving radioactive materials; the number of regulatory violations identified against Air Force
users by the primary regulating agency, the NRC; and recorded occupational exposures to workers.
    A1.1.1. Incidents and Mishaps. The total number of events involving radioactive materials reported
    in a calendar year by Air Force units to HQ AFMOA/SGPR and determined by SGPR to be a valid
    reportable event as defined in Title 10 CFR, Parts 0-199, Energy, or AFI 40-201, Managing Radioac-
    tive Materials in the US Air Force and AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program.
    A1.1.2. Violation Rate and Violations I-IV. The total number of violations per inspection and the
    number of Severity Level I, II, III or IV (Title 10 CFR, Part 2, Rules of Practice for Domestic Licens-
    ing Proceedings) violations of the US Air Force MML, USAF Radioactive Material permit conditions
    or federal regulations as reported by either AFIA or the NRC in a calendar year. AFIA and the NRC
    sends AFMOA/SGPR their reports involving violations.
    A1.1.3. Personnel Radiation Dose Summary RCS: HAF-SGP(A) 9232. The average annual dose
    and highest dose for all individuals working with radioactive materials as recorded in the Master Radi-
    ation Exposure Registry. Dose categories include total effective dose equivalent, whole body deep
    dose, lens of eye dose, shallow dose and extremity dose. Information on the occupational area for
    these individuals shall also be available. The Air Force Institute for Operational Health (AFIOH)
    sends AFMOA/SGPR a summary report by 1 April each year and supplements these reports during
    mishap situations and emergencies.

A1.2. Data are compiled annually and compared to the previous 4 years’ data. Goals are zero Air Force
incidents or mishaps, and worker and public exposures remain below federal regulatory limits and are
ALARA.
