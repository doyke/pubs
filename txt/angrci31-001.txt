                                             Chapter 3

                               SAFEKEEPING AND STORAGE

3.1. Safes.
     3.1.1. Classified information will be continuously protected by an authorized individual or
     secured in a GSA approved safe. Security monitors along with designated safe custodians
     will maintain a current list of all safes within their directorate or division. The list will
     include the safe number, serial number, location (building and room number, as applicable),
     and point-of-contact with a phone number. The list must also identify those who have access
     to the safe and access to the safe combination. Applicable cover sheets (AF Form 144, Top
     Secret Access Record and Cover Sheet, and SF Forms 704 and 705) will be attached to any
     classified document removed from a safe, to include when the classified documents are hand
     carried outside the designated work area.
     3.1.2. Funds, weapons, precious metals, or items susceptible to theft will not be stored with
     classified material.
     3.1.3. Safes will be unlocked only to meet specific mission requirements. It is the
     responsibility of the individual opening the safe to ensure those individuals requesting access
     to classified materials are properly identified, their clearance is adequate for the level of
     information requested, and they have a need-to-know.
     3.1.4. The period of time a safe is unlocked must be kept to a minimum. While the safe is
     unlocked, ensure a red "OPEN" sign is displayed and at least one individual with authorized
     access is able to visually monitor the safe at all times.
     3.1.5. Each time a safe is opened or closed, an entry on the SF 702, Security Container
     Check Sheet, is required. This form must be posted on the safe.
     3.1.6. Safe custodians will ensure a properly completed SF Form 700, Security Container
     Information, is maintained for each safe. Part 1 will be taped inside the locking drawer of the
     safe. Use of Part 2 is optional. However, when Part 2 is used, it must be marked with the
     highest classification level of material stored in the safe and stored in a safe other than the
     one for which it is being used.
     3.1.7. Combinations to safes, vaults, and secure rooms will be changed only by individuals
     having that responsibility and an appropriate security clearance. Combinations will be
     changed at the time a safe/vault is placed in use, whenever an individual knowing the
     combination no longer requires access to it, i.e. when a member departs the organization,
     when the combination has been subject to possible compromise, or when the safe, vault, or
     secure room is taken out of service. Use of a locally developed combination change control
     log will be used and filed in the appropriate directorate/division monitor’s security binder.
3.2. Damaged Safe Repair.
     3.2.1. Locksmiths or technicians must be GSA certified and must either have a favorable
     NAC or be continuously escorted while they are repairing safes. See guidance for unescorted
     entry to restricted areas in AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management.
ANGRCI31-001 1 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                      9


   3.2.2. Safe custodians who have had their GSA approved safe repaired must have the
   locksmith or technician confirm that the safe still meets GSA standards otherwise the safe
   may not be used for the protection of classified information. Findings and the source of
   confirmation must be recorded on an AFTO Form 36 and retained in the safe.
   3.2.3. Visit       the        DOD          Lock       Program        website    at
   https://portal.navfac.navy.mil/portal/page?_pageid=181,4914415&_dad=portal&_sche
   ma=PORTAL for additional information regarding safes and room locks.
3.3. Classified Reproduction. Since reproduction equipment and the reproduction process
involve substantial risk, the reproduction of classified material is limited to that which is mission
essential.
   3.3.1. Directorate or division security monitors will work with information assurance
   personnel to determine risks for reproductive equipment (including copiers, printers,
   facsimiles, and multifunction devices) and provide instructions on proper clearing practices
   as needed.
   3.3.2. Directorate or division 3D0X1 personnel, or designated alternate, will determine if the
   copier retains latent images when copying and provide instructions on how to clear them
   when they do.
   3.3.3. Directorate or division security monitors must post a notice on machines approved for
   copying classified material to inform users of the authority and clearing procedures.
   3.3.4. Notices prohibiting the reproduction of classified material must be posted on
   equipment uncleared for classified reproduction. Prohibitory notices are available from the
   ANGRC Information Protection Office through directorate and division security monitors.
3.4. End Of Day Security Checks.
   3.4.1. End of day security checks must be completed for areas or rooms housing security
   containers each day the room or area is entered (including holidays, down days, minimal
   manning days or weekends). NOTE: During shift changeover in the ANG Command
   Center, Command Center personnel are not required to perform an additional security check
   of the Operational Plans and Execution area.
   3.4.2. The SF 701, Activity Security Checklist, will be used to document the end of day
   security check. The SF 701 must be posted on or near the primary entrance/exit door to the
   area or room housing the security container. Although this checklist was developed for
   security items, additional items may be added to the checklist.
   3.4.3. In the event a safe/door is found not properly secured, the “discoverer” will
   immediately lock the safe/door and notify the directorate or division security monitor
   responsible for the area or room. The individual(s) notified will initially determine any loss
   or compromise, and immediately report it to their supervisor, who must in turn notify the
   ANGRC Information Protection Office by the end of the duty day. If the safe/door was
   found not properly secured outside of normal duty hours, the ANGRC Information Protection
   Office must be notified first opportunity the next following duty day.
3.5. Emergency Protection Plan (EPP).
 10                                                      ANGRCI31-001 1 SEPTEMBER 2011


   3.5.1. This instruction will be used for the emergency protection or removal of classified
   material in the event of a natural disaster or civil disturbance, terrorist activity, etc. A copy
   of this instruction will be near (not attached) to the security container in each area that
   classified material is stored or processed. These procedures also apply to NATO Secret
   material and above.
   3.5.2. Joint Base Andrews may be threatened by severe weather phenomena such as
   tornadoes, thunderstorms, hail storms, flash floods, and hurricanes. The possibility of fire
   always exists. Civil disturbances may consist of a group or groups of dissidents to large-
   scale riots. In any of these cases, classified material becomes vulnerable to compromise due
   to loss or theft and requires additional protection.
   3.5.3. Fire. If time permits before evacuation of an area, secure classified material in a vault
   or safe within the immediate area. Personnel will not, however, risk injury or loss of life to
   secure classified material. If classified material cannot be properly stored, personnel will
   evacuate the area to the limits established by emergency response forces. If this occurs, place
   the material in or on a desk, or if possible, handcarry the information out of the area.
   Personnel will notify their primary or alternate security monitor of any classified material left
   unsecured at the time of evacuation. Immediately after the emergency and authorization by
   emergency response forces to reenter the evacuated area, personnel will return to their area
   and check for unsecured classified material. If material is missing or inadvertent access or
   compromise is suspected, security monitors will comply with DOD 5200. 1-R, chapters 6
   (Safeguarding) and 9 (Security Education and Training). Emergency response forces will be
   debriefed if necessary after the situation is terminated. The owner of any classified material
   not properly stored shall determine if a debriefing is warranted. DOD 5200.1-R C10.1.6
   provides guidelines to determine if a debriefing is necessary.
   3.5.4. Natural disasters. If advance warning of severe weather is received, individual unit
   commanders and staff agency chiefs should limit the handcarry of classified information
   outside of the immediate work area and take steps to secure all classified material in security
   containers prior to the arrival of severe weather. When no warning of severe weather is
   received, secure classified as prescribed in paragraph 3.5.3.
   3.5.5. Civil disturbance. Normally, base support agencies such as Air Force Office of
   Special Investigations (AFOSI) and Security Forces receive advance warning of rallies,
   strikes, or demonstrations on or near the installation. Commanders and staff agency chiefs
   should plan for the increased security of classified material before the disturbance based on
   sources provided. Classified tests conducted in open areas and handcarrying classified
   documents should be suspended. Classified material should be maintained within the work
   area until termination of the disturbance.
   3.5.6. Emergency removal. Any unforeseen condition may warrant the emergency removal
   of classified information. In such cases, the order will be given by the 11 WG/CC. Always
   evacuate documents with the highest classification first.
3.6. Classified Meetings. Activities hosting classified meetings will ensure appropriate security
measures are taken in accordance with DOD 5200.1-R, paragraph 6.3.8. If the meeting is to take
place in a room within the ANGRC not normally used for classified meetings, the room must be
approved for use by either ANGRC Commander or ANGRC Vice Commander through the
ANGRC Information Protection Office. The activity hosting the classified meeting will identify
ANGRCI31-001 1 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                         11


a point of contact to receive personal instructions from the ANGRC Information Protection
Office on conducting the meeting.

                           MARKING CLASSIFIED MATERIAL

4.1. Marking Classified Material. Classified material in paper, electronic, and other formats
will be marked properly. Files, folders and similar groups of documents will also bear the proper
markings. Refer to DOD 5200.1-R, the ISOO Marking Booklet and AFI 31-401, Chapter 4 for
further information on the proper marking of classified material.
ANGRCI31-001 1 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                  13

                              DISPOSAL AND DESTRUCTION

5.1. General. As soon as classified material has served its intended purpose, it should be
processed for destruction. Until the material is destroyed it must be protected.
5.2. Annual Safe Clean-Out. Destruction should be accomplished on a monthly basis to
prevent the accumulation of excess classified material. As a minimum, each directorate or
division is responsible to conduct an annual safe clean-out designated by the ANGRC/CV as the
second Tuesday of March, annually. The clean-out must be documented and a copy of the
documentation must be submitted to the ANGRC Information Protection Office by the third
Tuesday of March, each year.
5.3. Top Secret Destruction. Two cleared personnel will witness and record the destruction of
top secret material and the destruction will be recorded on an applicable destruction certificate,
e.g., AF IMT 143, Top Secret Register Page.
5.4. Shredders.
   5.4.1. Shredders that are used to destroy classified information must produce a particle size
   equal to or less than 1mm x 5mm.
   5.4.2. New or replacement shredders for destruction of classified information must be
   purchased from the National Security Agency (NSA)-approved Equipment Product List.
   Visit      the      NSA        Information          Assurance    web       site      at
   http://www.nsa.gov/ia/government/mdg.cfm. Please note that the list is For Official Use
   Only (FOUO) and is updated quarterly on the restricted NSA site.
   5.4.3. Automated Information System (AIS) media will be disposed of according to AFSSI
   8580, Remanence Security.

                       TRANSMISSION AND TRANSPORTATION

6.1. Removing Classified Material from the Building.
   6.1.1. Personnel authorized access to classified information may remove classified
   information from their work center for the following purposes:
       6.1.1.1. Destruction during monthly reviews or during the annual clean-outs.
       6.1.1.2. For approved hand-carrying.
          6.1.1.2.1. Personnel authorized to hand-carry classified material must be briefed by
          their security monitor on the responsibilities for protection of classified information.
          The appropriate authorization media (DD Form 2501, Courier Authorization Card or
          Authorization Letter) will be issued to each member possessing the need to hand-
          carry classified information off base. The expiration date of the DD Form 2501 will
          not exceed one year. Whenever the authorized individual is no longer assigned to the
          ANGRC, the DD Form 2501 must be returned to the ANGRC Information Protection
          Office.
          6.1.1.2.2. Additional written documentation from the agency authorizing the hand-
          carrying of classified information is required when an individual hand-carrying
          classified information is required to travel by commercial aircraft or by any other
          means that would require a search of belongings. Refer to AFI 31-401, Para 6.7.1.1.
          for additional information.
   6.1.2. Classified material removed from a work center and carried within the ANGRC
   (Bldgs 3500/3501) must be protected by the appropriate coversheet and will be enclosed in
   an unmarked opaque folder, envelope, or similar wrapping, to and from work center.
6.2. Transmitting and Transporting Via Mail Systems. Classified information will only be
transmitted or transported by approved methods which are addressed in this section. AF IMT
310, Document Receipt and Destruction Certificate, will always be used when entering classified
material into a mail system.
   6.2.1. Overnight delivery.
       6.2.1.1. The Air Force authorizes the use of the current holder of the GSA contract for
       overnight delivery of Secret information in urgent cases and when the delivery is between
       DOD components and their cleared contractor facilities within the United States and its
       Territories. This applies to locations in Alaska, Hawaii, and Guam only when overnight
       delivery is possible.
       6.2.1.2. The Defense Security Service (DSS) maintains a list of authorized GSA contract
       overnight delivery services at http://www.dss.mil/isec/approved_overnight.htm.
          6.2.1.2.1. The carriers identified on the DSS list may be used for urgent overnight
          delivery of Secret and Confidential material within the continental United States
          (CONUS) when overnight delivery cannot reasonably be accomplished by the U.S.
          Postal Service. However, classified COMSEC information may not be transported
ANGRCI31-001 1 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                     15


          overnight. Controlled Cryptographic Information (CCI) that is unclassified may be
          shipped overnight. Carrier personnel should not be notified that the package contains
          classified material.
      6.2.1.3. Under no circumstances may a package remain in the possession of a carrier
      over a weekend or weekday holiday. Therefore, packages are typically shipped on
      Monday through Thursday only. However, security monitors may approve shipment on
      other days providing the receiver has appropriate procedures in place. These procedures
      must ensure that a cleared person will receive and sign for the package on Saturday,
      Sunday, or holidays, and that he or she is able to secure the package in approved storage.
      6.2.1.4. The sender is responsible for ensuring that an authorized person will be available
      to receive the delivery and verify the correct mailing address prior to sending.
   6.2.2. Postal Service. The Postal Service may also be used to transport classified material.
      6.2.2.1. Postal Service registered mail may be used within and between the 50 States, the
      District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
      6.2.2.2. U.S. Postal Service Express Mail within and between the 50 States, the District
      of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico may be used. The "Waiver of
      Signature and Indemnity" block on the U.S. Postal Service Express Mail Label 11-B may
      not be executed under any circumstances. The use of external (street side) Express Mail
      collection boxes is prohibited.
      6.2.2.3. U.S. Postal Service registered mail through Army, Navy, or Air Force Postal
      Service facilities outside the United States and its Territories may be used provided that
      the information does not at any time pass out of U.S. citizen control and does not pass
      through a foreign postal system or any foreign inspection;
      6.2.2.4. U.S. Postal Service and Canadian registered mail with registered mail receipt
      between U.S. Government and Canadian government installations in the United States
      and Canada may be used.
      6.2.2.5. Since first class mail bearing the “Return Service Requested” notice is an option
      for transmitting Confidential material, recipients must protect first class mail bearing
      “Return Service Requested” as Confidential material unless they determine the contents
      are unclassified. EXCEPTION: Official Mail Center (OMC) and Activity Distribution
      Offices (ADO) will comply with the provisions of DOD 4525.8-M/AF Sup.
          6.2.2.5.1. The outer envelope or wrapper shall be endorsed with “Return Service
          Requested” instead of “POSTMASTER: Do Not Forward.”
   6.2.3. Electronic means. Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) is the only
   approved electronic method of electronically transmitting Secret information within or
   outside of the ANGRC.
6.3. Preparing Classified Material for Transportation.
   6.3.1. Classified material will be enclosed in two opaque sealed envelopes or similar
   wrapping, size permitting. If the material is too large for envelopes, it will then be enclosed
   in two opaque sealed containers, such as boxes or heavy wrapping. If the classified material
   is an internal component of an item, then the outer shell or body may serve as the inner
 16                                                      ANGRCI31-001 1 SEPTEMBER 2011


   enclosure, provided no classified information is revealed. A locked briefcase can be used as
   an outer wrapping.
   6.3.2. Classified documents will be packaged so that the text will not be in direct contact
   with the inner envelope or container. AF Form 2595, Classified Protection Insertion Sheet,
   may be placed inside the inner envelope. The inner envelope will be stamped with the highest
   classification contained in the package.
   6.3.3. Material used for packing must be of such strength and durability as to provide
   security and protection while in transit and to facilitate the detection of tampering.
   6.3.4. Packages bearing classified material should always be examined for signs of
   tampering. If such signs are evident, any security monitor should be contacted.
   6.3.5. All incoming registered, certified, first class and express mail will be opened
   immediately to determine whether or not classified material is contained in the package.
   Otherwise, the recipient must place this type of incoming mail in an approved security
   container and open it their next duty day.
6.4. Transmitting over the phone or facsimile.
   6.4.1. Secure Terminal Equipment (STE). Personnel will use the STE, or other approved
   secure communication equipment, when discussing classified information on the phone.
   Prior to using a STE, members must receive training by the ANGRC COMSEC Responsible
   Officer.
   6.4.2. Facsimile. When a fax machine is used to transmit classified information, personnel
   must use an authorized secure fax machine along with a STE. Security monitors will ensure
   quick reference procedures are posted at the fax machine as required by AFI 31-401.
       6.4.2.1. Prior to transmitting, sender will call the receiving office to ensure an authorized
       person is available to receive the classified transmission, remain with the unit until the
       transmission or reception is completed and verify that all the material is accounted for.
ANGRCI31-001 1 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 17

                       SECURITY INCIDENTS AND VIOLATIONS

7.1. Reporting. Personnel who become aware of or believe that there may have been a
compromise, loss, unauthorized disclosure, or other infraction affecting the safeguarding of
classified information must report it without delay to their supervisor or their security monitor
who will in turn notify the ANGRC Information Protection Office before the end of the duty day.
7.2. Investigative requirements. The ANGRC Information Protection Office will advise the
Commander or Vice Commander of inquiry or investigative requirements as outlined in DOD
5200.1R and AFI 31-401.
   7.2.1. When an inquiry or investigation is required, an incident number will be assigned to
   the case by the ANGRC Information Protection Office and an inquiry or investigating
   official will be appointed by the directorate or division from which the incident originated.
   The inquiry or investigating official will have 30 days from the date of the incident to
   investigate, close and complete a report to the appointing authority through the ANGRC
   Information Protection Office. The appointing authority will in turn have 30 days to respond
   to and close the inquiry report.
   7.2.2. In situations where a person had unauthorized access to classified information, it is
   advisable for the classified information owner to discuss the situation with the individual to
   enhance the probability that he or she will properly protect it. If a debriefing is warranted,
   the debriefing will be documented on an AF IMT 2587, Security Termination Statement. If
   an individual willfully refuses to execute an AF IMT 2587, the individual’s supervisor, in the
   presence of a witness:
       7.2.2.1. Debriefs the individual verbally.
       7.2.2.2. Records the fact that the individual refused to execute the termination statement
       and was verbally debriefed.
       7.2.2.3. Ensures the individual no longer has access to any classified information.
       7.2.2.4. Forwards the AF IMT 2587 with comments annotated to the servicing ANGRC
       Information Protection Office for Security Information File (SIF) processing according to
       AFI 31-501.

                             DERIVATIVE CLASSIFICATION

10.1. Definition. Information is derivatively classified whenever it is extracted, paraphrased,
restated, or generated in a new form. Photocopying or otherwise mechanically reproducing
classified material is not derivative classification.
10.2. Derivative Classification Requirements. All cleared personnel who generate or create
material that should be derivatively classified are responsible for ensuring that the derivative
classification is accomplished in accordance with DOD 5200.1-R, Chapter 3.
10.3. Derivative Classification Accounting. Derivative classifications must be accounted for
and reported to the ANGRC Information Protection Office quarterly using an SF 311, Agency
Information Protection Program Data. The ANGRC Information Protection Office will request
SF 311 submissions from each directorate or division through the security monitor each quarter.
ANGRCI31-001 1 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                              21

              NATO CLASSIFIED REQUIREMENTS AND SAFEGUARDS

11.1. Authorized Access. The directorate or division security monitor will maintain an AF IMT
2583, Request for Personnel Security Action, on all personnel authorized access to NATO
classified information, to include each individual’s level of clearance.
   11.1.1. Access to NATO classified information will be based on the individual possessing
   the required equivalent U.S. security clearance, (see USSAN 1-69, United States Security
   Authority for NATO), need-to-know or when access is required in the performance of official
   duties, when the individual has received the NATO security briefing and has executed an
   NdA.
   11.1.2. NATO CONFIDENTIAL or above. Before granting individuals access to NATO
   CONFIDENTIAL or above, individuals must be given an initial NATO security briefing.
   The briefing will be will be documented on an AF IMT 2583 [Reference AFI 31-406,
   paragraph 4.9.]
11.2. U. S. Safeguarding, Marking, Transmission, Access, Dissemination, and
Accountability. These requirements apply equally to NATO classified material, with few
exceptions. Review USSAN 1-69 for detailed guidance and additional requirements.
11.3. Storage Requirements. NATO classified information storage requirements parallel those
for U.S. classified of the same level in accordance with DOD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-401. NATO
material can be stored in the same security container as non-NATO information provided the
NATO material is physically separated from non-NATO material by at least a file divider.
11.4. Debriefings. Personnel who no longer require access to NATO classified information will
be debriefed via AF IMT 2587.
