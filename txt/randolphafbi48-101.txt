     3.1. The 12 FTW Airpark Custodian will establish a radiation safety record for each
     historical aerospace vehicle they manage IAW AFI 84-103, U.S. Air Force Heritage
     Program. These records will detail all radioactive commodities present in each vehicle as
     documented by initial and periodic radiation surveys.

     3.2. The base RSO will ensure an initial radiation survey of each static display is conducted
     and findings are documented on AF Form 3583, Static Display Aerospace
RANDOLPHAFBI48-101           17 APRIL 2006                                                     13

   Vehicle/Component Radiation Survey Log, and/or AF Form 3584, Static Display
   Aerospace Vehicle/Component Radiation Swipe Log. If RAMs are determined to be
   present in a static display vehicle, the base RSO will ensure radiation exposures to Air Force
   personnel and the public are kept within acceptable limits. In addition, if RAMs is present,
   the base RSO will ensure periodic surveys of the displays are conducted every 3 years.

   3.3. If RAM is found to be present in a static display, all maintenance activity for the
   radioactive components must be coordinated through the base RSO. Radioactive components
   must never be sanded, ground, machined, drilled, etched, or subjected to any process that
   produces respirable particles or changes the form of the component.

   3.4. Report any damage to radioactive components of static displays to the base RSO
   immediately.

4. Radiation Exposure Incidents

   4.1. The worker will notify the unit RSO whenever a suspected overexposure occurs. The
   unit RSO will notify the base RSO within 1 hour (652-3131 during duty hours and 652-1859
   for the command post after duty hours). The unit RSO, in coordination with the base RSO,
   will obtain a signed narrative statement from the exposed worker and witnesses immediately.

   4.2. Specify procedures for reporting and investigating potential overexposures. The
   individual will immediately notify the incident to his/her supervisor and report to the primary
   care clinic (652-4373). Medical attention should be sought within the first 72 hours
   following exposure. The supervisor will in-turn notify the unit RSO who will contact the
   base RSO on initial report of the incident with the following information:

      4.2.1. Name, rank, and SSAN (last four) of exposed worker

      4.2.2. Radiation source--include activity (or power settings if x-ray source)

      4.2.3. Brief description of event

      4.2.4. Length of exposure

      4.2.5. Distance from source

      4.2.6. Description of medical or follow-up action

      4.2.7. Name, rank, and phone number of attending physician

   4.3. The exposed worker will report immediately to the clinic for physical examination. The
   physician will complete a SF 513, Medical Record-Consultation Sheet, to generate an
   AF Form 190, Occupational Illness/Injury Report.
14                                                  RANDOLPHAFBI48-101             17 APRIL 2006

     4.4. The installation RSO will make appropriate notifications and coordinate an
     investigation.

5. Radiation Protection Program Management Oversight

     5.1. Personnel dosimetry action levels are determined by the installation RSO, and serve to
     determine surveillance and control requirements. Action levels are defined as follows:

        5.1.1. Overexposure. A personnel dosimetry result that exceeds the maximum
        permissible dose. Investigate and document IAW AFI 48-125. The overexposure action
        level is established in AFI 48-125.

        5.1.2. Abnormal Exposure. Personnel dosimetry result which, if continued, could result
        in an overexposure. Investigate according to AFI 48-125. The abnormal exposure
        criteria are established in AFI 48-125.

        5.1.3. Investigative Action Level (IAL). Personnel dosimetry result above which an
        action should be taken to determine the reason for the exposure. The base and unit RSOs
        will jointly investigate monthly or quarterly personnel dosimetry results above the IAL.
        The IALs will be established by the base RSO and based on historical dosimetry results
        for potential exposure groups.

        5.1.4. Pregnant Female Action Level. All pregnant occupationally exposed workers
        who are on the TLD program will be placed on the monthly monitoring period. Personnel
        dosimetry result, if continued for the term of pregnancy, would exceed 100 mrem
        exposure limit for the fetus will be investigated by the base RSO and unit RSOs.

     5.2. The base RSO will accomplish annual radiation protection reviews. Results will be
     presented to the 12 FTW Combined Safety Council and 12 ADS Aerospace Medicine
     Council. Reviews will include:

        5.2.1. A review of all local publications and OIs to ensure they are current.

        5.2.2. A review of all radiation survey results for the past year to ensure all required
        surveys have been performed, documented, and appropriate corrective action taken.

        5.2.3. A review of all personnel dosimetry results for the past year to ensure adverse
        trends are noted and appropriate action has been taken.

        5.2.4. An update of the radiation source and RAM inventory. A summary of the
        locations and types of RAM will be provided to ground safety, the Fire Department, and
        12 MSG/CE Readiness.

        5.2.5. A review of all Air Force RAM permits to ensure currency and compliance with
        requirements.
RANDOLPHAFBI48-101          17 APRIL 2006                                                    15

       5.2.6. A review of radiation safety training to ensure the radiation safety training
       material is current, and training is being conducted and documented.

6. Medical Examinations

   6.1. Medical examinations/blood screening is no longer required for placement on the TLD
   program. Routine or preplacement exams are not required for RF radiation, ultraviolet
   radiation, or laser radiation for lasers in classes 1 through 3a. In all cases, if there is a
   suspected overexposure, the individual should report to the clinic for an examination.

                                      TERMINOLOGY

ALARA Program - This is the Air Force policy for minimizing ionizing radiation exposure.
ALARA means keeping radiation exposures as low as possible; and consistent with existing
technology, costs, and operational requirements.

Base RSO - The overall manager of the base Radiation Protection Program and appointed in
writing by the 12 FTW/CC. This individual will provide consultation and advice on the degree
of hazards associated with all forms of radiation. A bioenvironmental engineer or qualified
bioenvironmental engineering technician will serve as the base RSO (12 ADS/SGGB, 652-3256).

Unit RSO - The liaison official between the base and unit. The term “unit RSO” is a functional
title and not intended to denote a commissioned status or a job classification. The unit can be a
squadron, flight, or element.

Permit RSO - Designated within the terms in a RIC permit or NIC license to manage the
radiation protection aspects of RAM use.

Radioactive Waste - RAMs no longer useful, repairable, or needed by the Air Force. Excess
serviceable or repairable items containing RAMs are not considered radioactive waste.
