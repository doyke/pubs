      compounds and cleaning materials identified in the qualified product listing (QPL) are
      authorized for aircraft use. The QPL is located at Corrosion Control Facility, building
      830.
3.14. Aerospace Vehicle Coating and Marking Requirements. This section implements the
policies outlined in AFI 21-105, Aerospace Equipment Structural Maintenance, and provides
guidance for applying command approved, non-USAF standard aircraft coatings and markings as
authorized in T.O. 1-1-8. Paint schemes/configurations and USAF standard aircraft markings
will be applied in accordance with TO 1-1-8 and the applicable aircraft technical order.
3.14. (HOLLOMANAFB)Aerospace Vehicle Coating and Marking Requirements.
   3.14.1. Advanced Performance Coating. Advanced Performance Coating (APC) is the
   preferred topcoat unless mandated otherwise IAW weapon system specific technical data.
   This preferred coating system includes the appropriate Mil-PRF-23377 primer for bare metal
   uncovered during preparation, non-chromated tie coat material and an approved APC
   topcoat.
   3.14.2. Coating System Scoring and Maintenance. All ACC units are required to score
   aircraft coating systems to determine frequency of topcoat application. Fighter units should
   plan to scuff sand and overcoat the entire aircraft between depot cycles as necessary. Many
   fighter aircraft will require a complete overcoat at 36 months, but some may only require
   touch-up. All aircraft painting will be scheduled on a worst first basis to maintain coating
   system integrity and aircraft appearance. All aircraft coating systems except B-2, F-117 and
   F-22 will be evaluated/rated every 6 months for appearance/coating system integrity using
   applicable technical data or a locally developed system. The aircraft must be washed and
   clean prior to paint scoring. Supervisors will use ratings to determine corrosion
   treatment/paint scheduling priority. Units are required to adopt maintenance-painting
   techniques (i.e., spot painting and sectionalized painting as stated in T.O. 1-1-8) to maintain
   aircraft corrosion protection and appearance between overcoats. Partial painting ―sections‖
   of the aircraft will help reduce the effects of mottling and mismatch. Units should rotate
   Commander’s aircraft to prevent excessive paint build-up from too frequent over coating.
   Fully over coated aircraft will be documented in CAMS and the individual aircraft AFTO
   Form 95 for tracking purposes. Large aircraft units should rely on spot maintenance painting
   and sectionalized painting between depot cycles to maintain the coating system integrity.
   3.14.3. Aircraft Markings. Aircraft markings will be applied to aircraft as specifically
   authorized by HQ ACC, this instruction, T.O. 1-1-8, or the applicable aircraft technical order.
   Low observable aircraft markings not currently approved necessitates a waiver from HQ
   ACC/LGMS with System Program Directorate (SPD) approval due to strict survivability
   analysis requirements. Aircraft inputs to depot will be marked IAW with Air Force
   directives and this instruction only, unless otherwise approved by HQ ACC/LGM. HQ
   ACC/LGMS is the point of contact for aircraft painting and markings. HQ ACC/LGMS is
   also the point of contact for all AF unit designation markings. This listing can be found in
   Attachment 3 of this instruction. All aircraft markings and basic paint schemes will be
   maintained intact, legible and distinct in color. Command standardization of markings by
   mission design series (MDS) is of primary concern.

                             F-22 OUTER MOLD LINE AUDIT

A4.1. (ADDED) Aircraft Structural Maintenance (ASM) personnel will perform an F-22
Signature Assessment System (SAS) and aircraft Outer Mold Line (OML) audit to correlate
aircraft damage markings with defects in the SAS. A minimum of one audit per aircraft will be
completed each year by a Low Observable (LO) Section Supervisor proficient in OML
inspection. Scheduling aircraft for this audit will be accomplished during the monthly/weekly
shared resource scheduling meeting. All errors found during the audit must be accurately
reflected in Integrated Maintenance Information System (IMIS)/SAS and briefed to all LO
section personnel. Units must establish a local SAS management policy that outlines the
frequency of audits/QA evaluations necessary to ensure SAS data is accurate. Note: There is an
unacceptable risk to aircraft radar cross section/aircraft survivability from substandard
maintenance and/or inaccurate signature assessment system data inputs. A variety of aircraft
structural maintenance proficiency levels are performing LO maintenance and we must verify
that all work is completed IAW technical order data and documented properly in SAS.
A4.2. (ADDED) The following equipment is required to perform SAS margin audit:
   A4.2.1. (ADDED) Militope or Portable Maintenance Aid (PMA)
   A4.2.2. (ADDED) Sharpie
   A4.2.3. (ADDED) Pen or pencil
   A4.2.4. (ADDED) Fuselage station buttline chart
   A4.2.5. (ADDED) Roll of tape (blue 3M 2090)
   A4.2.6. (ADDED) Booties
A4.3. (ADDED) Steps to perform aircraft SAS margin audits:
   A4.3.1. (ADDED) Annotate aircraft margin for reference
   A4.3.2. (ADDED) Access priority screen
   A4.3.3. (ADDED) Highlight or circle all Logistics Control Numbers (LCNs) that are
   detailed in the priority screen on the LCN chart. Stand-alone LCNs are also annotated.
   Ensure seam filler LCNs are also annotated.
   A4.3.4. (ADDED) Access historical screen and compare each damage input of every
   highlighted/circled LCN with what is on the aircraft. If any differences in size, pay particular
   attention to existing damage for extended growth, if fuselage station or butt-line station are
   found, use the edit feature to correct and annotate action in supplemental data. Mark damage
   with a piece of blue 3M 2090 tape. This will make the following OML inspection easier.
   A4.3.5. (ADDED) If damage is not found on aircraft but reside in the historical, annotate
   for removal later. This scenario can be common due to previous facilitate other maintenance
   or repair actions.
   A4.3.6. (ADDED) Remove the LCNs that do not have associated damage on the aircraft by
   a brush/roll repair.

  A4.3.7. (ADDED) Annotate any damage found and also any marked damage that does not
  have the blue 3M 2090 tape on them. Sometimes damage is marked but does not get input
  into SAS. Input any new damage and any non-inputted damage found.
