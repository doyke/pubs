   Casualty Operations Center in the shortest possible time to ensure prompt, accurate, and
   humane notifications of PNOK. The CAST is appointed in writing by the Commander, Force
   Support Squadron and is composed of members from the Personnel Support for Contingency
   Operations (PERSCO) team, FSOXU (FSS Unit Readiness) and the Airmen and Family

   procedures that help the Casualty Assistance Representative (CAR) and other casualty
   personnel.

   CAST to augment the CAR as necessary, at which time CAST team support will become
   their primary duties.

   CAR) and base-level exercises that facilitate familiarization with casualty reporting
   procedures.
