1. SCOPE. This instruction applies to all units and activities assigned and/or attached to Little
Rock AFB AR.
2. Overview. MRT taskings: MRTs are tasked by 618th TACC/XOCL directly to the
Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) when an off-station aircraft is broken and requires
repair. MRT support falls into one of two categories: (1) AMC Operational Missions such as
Channel missions and Off-station trainers; or, (2) in support of a "Named or Numbered"
Contingency Operation, HUMRO, Exercise or Special Assignment Airlift Mission (SAAM).
3. If the aircraft is deployed in support of AMC operations (first category), the MRT uses
DTS created TDY Orders published by the MOC Senior or designated
representation. Figures 1 and 2 describe the MRT cargo and informational flow between the
Maintenance Operations Center (MOC), supporting MRT unit, and Logistic Readiness Squadron
(LRS). Sections within LRS are: Aircraft Services (LGRA); Air Terminal Operations Center
(ATOC); and Cargo Movements (LGRDDC). Paragraph 12 describes the Contingency,
Exercise, Deployment (CED) orders process.

Figure 2. MRT Information Flow




4. MOC Responsibilities:
   4.1. Upon notification/decision to generate MRT shipment from TACC/AMU, MOC notifies
   supporting unit. Unit provides MOC with POC and other shipment information (i.e., going
   organic or commercial, MILSTRIP or non-MILSTRIP).
   4.2. Contact ATOC at ext 7-3086 or 7127 with POC and shipment information (i.e., going
   organic) or commercial, MILSTRIP or non-MILSTRIP)
5. MRT Generating Units Responsibilities:
   5.1. For MILSTRIP shipments, units will requisition parts IAW established procedures, and
   supply will provide the part to the Cargo Movements (19 LRS/LGRDDC) Section.
   LGRDDC will process and ship commercially or take to Aircraft Services (LGRA) for
   organic airlift (i.e., C-130).
   5.2. For non-MILSTRIP shipments, units must determine if the shipments going via organic
   lift or commercially.
      5.2.1. Commercial shipments: coordinate with 19 LRS/ LGRDDC on date, and time
      the cargo is going to be delivered to building 455.

       packed IAW any Special Packaging Instructions (SPI), or provide an AF Form 451,
       Request for Packaging Service. If a crate needs to be built, contact the Packing and
       Crating Section as soon as possible, or at a minimum of 24-hours prior to aircraft

    required to deliver the equipment to the cargo marshalling yard (building 257) at least 4-
    hours prior to the scheduled aircraft departure. Shipment must be accompanied by a
    qualified technical specialist appointed on letter by the commander. Cargo arriving late,
    within the 4-hour window will be processed as fast as possible; however, if the delay
    jeopardizes the launch sequence timing, then the unit inherits some or all of the late
    aircraft departure responsibilities.
       5.2.2.1. The unit representative will provide a DD Form 1149, Requisition And
       Invoice/Shipping Document, or Logistics Module Packing and Load Lists to the

       is made aware of any special handling instructions i.e. Classified, Sensitive, or
       HAZMAT. Additionally, USAF/ILGD has directed mandatory use of the web-based
       Form DD 1149, which can be found at: https://lsotools.wpafb.af.mil/dd1149.
       5.2.2.2. Ensure the shipping documentation includes applicable information
       (destination, local point of contact, telephone number, aircraft mission number, tail
       number, parking spot, enroute locations, and scheduled departure date and time). If
       this is a higher headquarters-directed shipment, the unit must provide the name,
       organization, and telephone number of the individual directing the mission.
       5.2.2.3. If the shipment is hazardous materials, the units Hazardous Material
       Technical Specialist is required to provide Shipper’s Declaration of Dangerous Goods
       forms IAW AFJMAN 24-204.
