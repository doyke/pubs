                                            Chapter 1

                                           GENERAL

1.1. Introduction. As a component of United States Transportation Command (USTC), Air
Mobility Command (AMC), through its global mobility forces, provides support for the global
engagement of US forces in support of national objectives. As part of its global mobility forces,
AMC maintains expeditionary capable, highly mobile contingency response forces to manage,
coordinate, support, and control global mobility missions. Contingency response forces are
deployed to locations where United States Air Force (USAF) air mobility operational support is
insufficient or nonexistent. They provide C2, communications, aerial port services, aircraft
maintenance and may contain a Contingency Support Element (CSE) from functional areas such
as security forces, weather, intelligence, etc., to ensure safe, effective air mobility operations.
These forces deploy on short-notice to support Special Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAMs),
Joint Airborne/Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT), exercises, tanker support, contingencies,
and emergency relief. Active duty Contingency Response Wings (CRW) provides a core
capability which consists of C2, communications, aerial port, and aircraft maintenance. All other
units referenced in this instruction provide mobile C2 and communications capability only.
    1.1.1. Key Terms and Definitions.
       1.1.1.1. ―Will‖ and ―Shall‖ indicate a mandatory requirement.
       1.1.1.2. ―Should‖ is normally used to indicate a preferred, but not mandatory, method of
       accomplishment.
       1.1.1.3. ―May‖ indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
       1.1.1.4. A ―Note‖ indicates an operating procedure, technique, etc., considered essential
       to emphasize.
1.2. Application. This instruction applies to all AMC air mobility control units (AMCU)
capable of providing contingency response forces and equipment in support of air mobility
operations. References to AMCU apply equally to all in-garrison organizations, including
CRWs, Contingency Response Groups (CRG), Global Mobility Squadrons (GMS), Global
Mobility Response Squadrons (GMRS) and Global Support Squadrons (GSS), unless otherwise
noted. References to contingency response forces apply equally to all deployed organizations
including but not limited to CRGs, Contingency Response Elements (CRE), Contingency
Support Teams (CST), Airfield Survey Teams (AST), Contingency Response Teams (CRT),
Contingency Support Elements (CSE), and AMC-gained Air National Guard (ANG) and Air
Force Reserve Command (AFRC)).
1.3. Purpose and Scope. The purpose of this instruction is to define responsibilities and
provide basic guidance for the management and employment of contingency response forces. It
defines responsibilities and tasks that each organization must accomplish with established
minimum requirements. It does not dictate how to accomplish those tasks or limit unit
prerogatives to establish their own training, procedures, standards, and goals in concert with this
instruction. Specific policies concerning taskings, procedures, and management directives will be
provided to the units from HQ AMC Directorate of Air Space and Information
Operations/Expeditionary Mobility Operations Division/Mobile C2 Branch (HQ AMC /A3MM).
AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009                                                                      7


Additionally, this instruction prescribes operating procedures for the Airfield Survey program,
the AMC Affiliated Contingency Load Planning Program (ACLP) program, the communications
maintenance program, deployed capabilities, and command relationships.
1.4. Mission. Contingency response forces provide the capability to operate worldwide where
little or no mobility operations support exists. Mobile C2 elements provide command leadership
and management of deployed forces, the aerial port element provides cargo and passenger
handling services required to meet operational requirements, and the quick-turn aircraft
maintenance element provides basic crew chief skills to assist transiting aircraft. In order to meet
these objectives, the following specific missions must be accomplished:
   1.4.1. Establish mobile C2 operations at designated airfields. This includes command and
   control, communications, aerial port unit movement capabilities, and aircraft maintenance to
   provide support to launch, recover, and refuel transient aircraft. Additionally, contingency
   response forces have the capability to sustain operations under bare-base conditions (5 days
   without resupply) when unit self-sufficiency is required.
   1.4.2. Deploy CRTs to manage air mobility operations and provide support to airlift users in
   moving passengers and cargo under circumstances when a CRE capability would be too
   large, minimum operating hours are expected (12 hrs or less) and/or short-ton thru-put is
   expected to be light, and finally if a CRE is unavailable.
   1.4.3. Provide contingency response forces to the Air Force’s Open the Airbase force
   module IAW the CRG and Airbase Opening directives.
   1.4.4. Conduct CONUS and OCONUS airfield surveys to assess the capability and
   limitations of specified airfields in support of planned or anticipated air mobility operations.
   1.4.5. Provide training in air mobility contingency load planning and equipment preparation
   to all airlift users.
   1.4.6. Provide communications support for deployed C2 operations.
   1.4.7. Deploy a Contingency Response Management Cell to the Air Mobility Division
   (AMD), when needed (two or more contingency response force teams deployed in support of
   the same theater), to monitor and manage contingency response forces. Source preferably
   with the 7E1AD UTC.
   1.4.8. Provide stage crew management at Global Mobility locations (4 crews or less).
1.5. Contingency Response Forces Military Essentiality Status and Priority. Through its
service components, the Department of Defense (DOD) identifies and prioritizes essential
military manpower, materiel, and programs to ensure proper management and allocation of
critical resources.
   1.5.1. Per AFI 38-204, Programming USAF Manpower, mobile C2 personnel are designated
   a direct combat support unit with a military essentiality status (MES) code A. This is the data
   code used in the unit authorization file (UAF). Core manpower positions do not require
   active engagement in combat; however, contingency response force personnel duties are
   critical to combat operational success and may expose them to hostile action.
   1.5.2. In accordance with AFI 16-301, USAF Air Force Priority System for Resources
   Management, contingency response forces deploy as direct combat support units and have a
8                                                        AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009


    DoD force activity designator (FAD) essentiality rating of FAD II and a precedence rating of
    2-01 through 2-10 (FAD IV and a precedence rating of 4-01 through 4-10 for ANG and
    AFRC during peacetime; revert to FAD II when deployed/mobilized).
1.6. General Policies. The following policies apply to contingency response forces, including
but not limited to CREs, ASTs, Affiliation Training Teams (ATT), Contingency Load Planning
Teams (CLPTs), ALCFs, CSTs, CRTs, CSEs, Joint Inspectors (JIs), and In-Transit Visibility
(ITV).
    1.6.1. Orders. The following special authorizations are approved for inclusion in all mission
    temporary duty (TDY) orders. (This includes AF Form 938, Request and Authorization for
    Active Duty Training/Active Tour, used to order ANG and AFRC members to active duty).
       1.6.1.1. Members on active flying status are authorized additional crewmember (ACM)
       status on tanker/airlift aircraft.
       1.6.1.2. During travel to and from a deployed location and while at the deployed location
       (work load permitting) personnel on active flying status may update their flying currency
       on aircraft in which they are current and qualified. Personnel should obtain prior approval
       from the flying unit and be entered on the file copy AF Form 4327A, Crew Flight (FA)
       Authorization, or applicable theater command form once that unit returns to home station.
       1.6.1.3. IAW AMCI 11-208, Tanker/Airlift Operations, all contingency response forces
       personnel are authorized mission essential ground personnel (MEGP) status to and from
       deployed locations. Flight deck seating and use of aircraft radios to coordinate mission
       information with the aircrew or other agencies is authorized with concurrence of the
       aircraft commander.
       1.6.1.4. When mission requirements dictate, orders will direct personnel to travel in
       civilian clothes.
       1.6.1.5. Team integrity is essential.
    1.6.2. Quarters. Every effort should be made to use government or contract quarters at the
    deployed location. The deployed commander/team chief may use commercial facilities when
    military lodging facilities are nonexistent or do not meet Air Force standards (AFI 34-246,
    Air Force Lodging Program). The Combatant/Theater Commander, through the Commander
    of Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) has force protection responsibility for all military forces
    in his geographic area of responsibility (AOR) and may require the contingency response
    forces to relocate or change billeting arrangements. AMC controlled commanders/team
    chiefs are still required to contact the AMC Threat Working Group (TWG) and 618th Tanker
    Airlift Control Center (618 TACC)/XOP for additional guidance and confirmation of existing
    threats. 618 TACC/XOP will task additional Expeditionary Combat Support (ECS) if
    required. When an AMD is present, forces will contact the theater TWG.
       1.6.2.1. Teams will only deploy under field conditions due to military necessity or to
       meet mission objectives. Although contingency response forces have bare base
       capability, ECS is normally the responsibility of the exercise/theater host and will be
       outlined in the exercise/contingency OPORD prior to deployment.
AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009                                                                  9


   1.6.3. Voice capable communications must be readily available to deployed team chiefs and
   commanders to maintain connectivity to the 618 TACC and Air Mobility Division (AMD) (if
   present).
   1.6.4. Passports and International Driving Permits. Contingency response forces personnel
   covered by this instruction will have passports purchased at government expense. If an
   international driving permit is required, it will be purchased at government expense as well.
   1.6.5. Deployed Personnel Utilization/Additional Duties. Work schedules for deployed
   operations are based on 12-hour work shifts with minimum personnel and assets.
   Contingency response forces deployments do not normally exceed 45 days. Written approval
   from the commander with operational control (OPCON) authority is required to use
   contingency response forces assets and personnel to support any non-primary mission
   requirement.
   1.6.6. In-Garrison Personnel Utilization/Additional Duties. (Active Duty only) To ensure
   each AMCU maintains a nucleus of personnel to meet the Design Operational Capability
   (DOC) response requirement, members should not be included within host base additional
   duty requirements (except bay orderly for dorm residents). However, memoranda of
   agreement with host wings may be established for currency, professional development and
   other identified augmentation support. Members are still eligible for deployment while
   assigned additional duties.
   1.6.7. AMCU loadmasters and boom operators will not load aircraft either at home station or
   at deployed locations unless they are current and qualified on the assigned aircraft and have
   had proper pre-mission crew rest.
   1.6.8. ARC Scheduling. ARC contingency response forces will be placed in an official duty
   status to accomplish all of the following tasks:
   1.6.8.1. Pre-mission planning, to include planning conference attendance
       1.6.8.2. Equipment preparation and packing.
       1.6.8.3. Team briefings
       1.6.8.4. Travel to and from the deployed location
       1.6.8.5. Mission operations
       1.6.8.6. Equipment recovery and turn-in
       1.6.8.7. After-action reporting
1.7. Pilot Unit Responsibilities. A pilot unit will be designated for each UTC. Guidelines for
pilot unit and non-pilot unit responsibilities are in AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations Planning
and Execution. UTC change coordination between pilot and all non-pilot units is mandatory.
1.8. Deviations. The on-site commander may authorize deviations from prescribed methods if
required for mission accomplishment. Safety will never be compromised. 618 TACC/XOP and
HQ AMC/A3 will be informed of all deviations that occur as soon as practical. Unit supplements
to this instruction require HQ AMC/A3 approval.
1.9. Changes and Supplements. Recommendations for improvement or changes to this
instruction are encouraged. Submit recommendations for changes to this publication to HQ
10                                                     AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009

                            ORGANIZATIONS AND FUNCTIONS

2.1. General. This chapter describes the elements that make up the deployed contingency
response forces C2 structure, units that comprise it, organizations that manage it and
relationships that support its functions and tasks. Additionally, this section defines the C2
structure for AMCUs. The procedures for the management and tasking of contingency response
forces equipment and personnel will be the same during peacetime, contingency, and
humanitarian relief operations. Contingency response forces will have the capability to surge to
wartime levels of effort using the same procedures and facilities that are used on a day-to-day
basis. The centralized management and tasking organizations are at HQ AMC and the 618
TACC. Further discussion of C2, can be found in AMCI 10-202V1, AMC Command and Control
Operations, and AMCI 10-202V3, Contingency and Wartime Air Mobility Management.
Questions about AMC Global Mobility Forces policy should be directed to HQ AMC/A3M.
2.2. Mobile C2 Support Organizations. This portion applies to the following organizations:
618 TACC/ XOP and HQ AMC/A3M.
   2.2.1. 618 TACC/XOP coordinates with other 618 TACC, AMC, USTC, and Unified
   Command and Air Component’s planning agencies to validate, source, task, deploy, and
   manage deployed mission support forces. For their assigned taskings, 618 TACC/XOP will
   be responsible for:
       2.2.1.1. Exercise and contingency planning, serving as a single point for coordinated
       taskings, the coordination for airlift and the tracking of deployment mission support
       forces (MSF), and for coordinating MSF capability assessment.
       2.2.1.2. Coordinating air mobility mission support requirements and problem resolution.
       2.2.1.3. Attending or coordinating sourcing of AMCU personnel to attend JA/ATT,
       exercise, and other planning conferences in which airlift/tanker mission support
       requirements will be discussed or identified.
       2.2.1.4. Receiving    and    coordinating   manpower      and    materiel   requests   and
       recommendations.
       2.2.1.5. Coordinating sourcing of resources to fill mission support shortfalls.
       2.2.1.6. Coordinating deployment and redeployment airlift for mission support forces.
       2.2.1.7. Coordinate initial sourcing for SAAM, JA/ATT, and exercise and contingency
       mission support equipment and manpower and materiel packages. The Deliberate and
       Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES) message is the AMC
       recognized source for tasking all AMC Mission Support Forces.
       2.2.1.8. Determining format and procedures for building DCAPES taskings and
       publishing a daily DCAPES tasking message (if required).
       2.2.1.9. Creating, coordinating, and publishing mission support plan identifications
       (PID), time-phased force and deployment data (TPFDD), and unit line numbers (ULN)
12                                                        AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009


        based on manpower and materiel inputs in support of Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS)
        exercises and contingencies.
        2.2.1.10. Publishing mission support ULNs in the daily DCAPES message and
        coordinating ULN sourcing with the appropriate AMC agency for unit levy flow.
        2.2.1.11. Publishing support PID, TPFDD, and ULNs in the Joint Operation Planning
        and Execution System (JOPES) for CR force taskings for USTC tracking and theater
        commander visibility.
        2.2.1.12. Managing the MPA program and authorizing the use of MPA days for
        deployed CRE, CRT, and AMD missions. Requesting and coordinating annual MPA day
        authorizations and providing quality assessment of the 618 TACC/XOP MPA programs.
     2.2.2. HQ AMC/A3MM (Expeditionary Mobility Operations Division, Mobile C2 Branch)
     is the AMC staff agency that manages AMCU manpower and equipment programs,
     establishes command policies and procedures, and provides guidance for training, readiness,
     and employment of those forces. HQ AMC is the lead command and proponent for all
     AMCU/ Global Mobility Force functional management. HQ AMC/A3MM will be
     responsible for:
        2.2.2.1. Establishing policy and procedures for all AMCU and Global Mobility Force
        issues to include coordination with Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) Functional Areas,
        ANG, AFRC, headquarters.
        2.2.2.2. Sourcing and validating 7Exxx and 7FVUN UTC manpower and material
        requests, and recommendations for their execution.
        2.2.2.3. Managing AMCU manpower and equipment authorizations, tables of
        allowances, and MRSP authorizations.
        2.2.2.4. Developing and advocating funding for new equipment, communication
        systems, computer systems, and ensuring functionality, interoperability, and suitability of
        those systems.
        2.2.2.5. Establish and standardize training programs for the contingecny response forces
        and evaluate training programs for AMCU personnel.
        2.2.2.6. Acting as focal point for ideas, electronic databases, and projects initiated or
        conducted by individual AMCUs to minimize duplication of effort by individual units
        and to disseminate methods and solutions to all squadrons.
        2.2.2.7. Providing AMCU quality assistance and standardization policy, guidance, and
        on-site assessments.
        2.2.2.8. Publishing instructions, pamphlets, handbooks, messages, and other written
        guidance to support all CR force planning and operations functions.
2.3. In-Garrison (Home Station) Organizations. Unit commanders are responsible for
manning, training, and equipping assigned personnel IAW Chapter 4 of this instruction.
Commanders are responsible for ensuring the pre-deployment planning and preparation in
support of mission taskings is properly completed. Personnel and equipment will be able to load
aboard transportation medium within 12 hours of tasking (36 hours for ARC forces).
AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009                                                                  13


Commanders are also responsible for ensuring the post-deployment reconstitution of personnel
and equipment is accomplished.
   2.3.1. Contingency Response Wing (CRW) – The CRWs are the active duty units that
   contain contingency response forces comprised of Contingency Response Groups and
   Contingency Operations Support Groups.
   2.3.2. Contingency Response Group (CRG) – The in-garrison mission of the CRG is to
   ensure Force Module 1 (Open the Airbase) is prepared to support the combatant commander
   by opening airfields in a permissive, uncertain or hostile environment. Force Module 1
   contains various Unit Type Codes (UTCs) that provide the combatant commander the
   capability to establish the foundation for an air head once an airfield is seized. When
   postured, deployable forces must present themselves and their equipment for deployment
   within 12 hours from formal notification.
   2.3.3. Global Support Squadron (GSS) – The in-garrison mission of the GSS is to prepare to
   deploy contingency response forces to locations where the en-route support for air mobility
   operations is insufficient or nonexistent. Additionally, the GSS assists the CRGs by
   facilitating training for contingency response forces. The GSS may be responsible for the
   management and maintenance of UTC-assigned equipment for the CRW and equipping
   CRW assigned personnel. With few exceptions, the unit is comprised of deployable forces
   that must present themselves and their equipment for deployment within 12 hours from
   formal notification.
   2.3.4. Airlift Control Flights (ALCFs) – The ARC ALCFs contain UTCs capable of
   providing the mobile C2 portion of the enabler air mobility operations forces and the ability
   to augment theater AMDs. As Guard and Reserve forces, the units must present themselves
   and their equipment for deployment within 36 hours (12 hours when mobilized) from formal
   notification. While there isn’t a standard organizational composition or structure, ALCF’s are
   collocated with an ARC airlift wing and are normally resident within the Operations Group.
2.4. Deployed Organizations. Several types of C2 organizations and special purpose teams
may be deployed in support of air mobility operations. They are temporary in nature and are
established at deployed locations to manage, control and provide a variety of services and
support to the air mobility mission.
   2.4.1. When the AMCU commander/flight chief or designated representative receives an
   execution order for a contingency, real-world, or emergency tasking, contingency response
   forces have 12 hours (36 hours for ARC forces) to recall, brief, mobilize in-garrison
   manpower through the processing line (time permitting), and deliver materials to the ready
   line for deployment. The planning phase of operations normally occurs between the alert
   order and the execution order; however, mission requirements may dictate that the planning
   phase also take place within the required response time. Contingency response force
   advanced echelon (ADVON) packages may be moved earlier if mission requirements dictate.
   AMCUs must maintain adequate recall rosters and procedures to ensure available in-garrison
   personnel can meet the required response time. Deployed contingency response forces will
   maintain the ability to roll-up and redeploy within 12 hours of notification.
   2.4.2. The host wing, group, or squadron to which an AMCU is assigned must ensure
   adequate mobility support and procedures have been established to deploy contingency
14                                                        AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009


     response forces within the allocated time. Contingency response forces resources are
     normally among the first forces deployed during contingencies. For this reason, the
     commanders/flight chiefs and supervisory personnel must work closely with mobility
     processing organizations to ensure proper sequencing and timing of deploying chalks.
     Contingency response force members will not be tasked to be permanent members of host
     mobility processing units; however, the AMCU may designate members to remain until the
     last chalk to help coordinate deployment issues.
     2.4.3. Once contingency response forces deploy, capabilities (personnel and/or equipment)
     cannot be reassigned or given another tasking without commander/team chief coordination.
     Additionally the commander/ team chief will not redeploy personnel without controlling
     agency approval.
     2.4.4. Deployed contingency response force designation. When necessary to combine UTCs
     from various units to form a complete deployed capability, the deployed organization name
     will be defined by the unit providing the commander or team chief. The unit is responsible
     for the overall operation and therefore determines the deployed unit designation. The
     deployed organization name will be defined by:
        2.4.4.1. Commander’s/team chief’s parent organization (CRW for CONUS active duty,
        CRG for theater assets, wing for ARC, etc).
        2.4.4.2. An alpha designator, for multiple contingency response teams from the same
        unit.
        2.4.4.3. The team designation (IAW Para 2.6. and sub paragraphs).
        2.4.4.4. Unclassified location identifier EXAMPLE: ―615 CRW CRE/B/EDDF" would
        be designated as such because the team chief is from the 573 GSS, part of the 615 CRW
        (parent organization), this is a CRE (contains at least core mobile C2, maintenance and
        port), this is the second CRE (B) deployed from the 615th, and is deployed to Frankfurt,
        Germany (ICAO - EDDF).
     2.4.5. Contingency Response Group (CRG). CRG describes the composite group of
     deployed forces that provide the combatant commander with a portion of the Open the
     Airbase force module. This deployed capability bridges the gap between seizure forces and
     sustainment forces (in subsequent force modules) and consists of the specific complement of
     skill sets defined by the Air Staff. contingency response forces embedded within the CRG
     will follow the guidance of this regulation.
     2.4.6. Contingency Response Element (CRE). The CRE is a deployed organization at
     forward locations where air mobility operational support is non-existent or insufficient. The
     core capability sets of a CRE are C2, communications, aerial port, and aircraft maintenance.
     CREs provide minimum essential on-load, offload, and en route aircraft mission support
     during deployment, employment, and redeployment operations. CRE team leaders will be
     certified IAW Chapters 4 and 5 of this AMCI (see applicable chapter for training
     requirements and waiver authority).
        2.4.6.1. CRE organizational structures will vary depending on the mission. CRE
        commanders will accomplish detailed planning for the tasked deployment and make
        specific recommendations on the type and size of manpower and material required to
AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009                                                                 15


     AMC/A3MM. In situations where time is extremely limited, 618 TACC and
     AMC/A3MM will accomplish detailed planning on behalf of the CRE commander.
     CREs may then request changes to the Manpower and Material (M&M) package. M&M
     packages are only required by exception when the tasked unit has a change in manning or
     material to the tasking received. NOTE: AMC/A3MM may direct deployment of
     specific equipment and personnel based on contingency or deliberate planning factors if
     time precludes the involvement of the deploying AMCU.
     2.4.6.2. The CRE commander is ultimately responsible for all aspects of air mobility
     operations at a designated airfield and will form a cohesive team from key functional area
     CSEs. These functional area CSEs may be sourced from different units.
  2.4.7. Contingency Response Team (CRT). A CRT performs the same functions as a CRE,
  but on a smaller scale. The CRT is led by an enlisted supervisor (7-level or above) trained
  within the unit and certified by the commander. A CRT is capable of supporting operations
  for 12 hours a day, but will maintain 24 hour C2 coverage. The CRT chief is usually a
  loadmaster or boom operator as prescribed by the 7E1AF UTC Mission Capability
  (MISCAP) Statement. However, any core enlisted AFSC may be trained, certified, and
  deployed as a CRT Team Chief. CSEs will augment a CRT as required.
  2.4.8. Stage Operations Management. In cases where there is insufficient aircrew
  management related services, the CRE or CRT may manage a limited number of stage crews
  (no more than 4) as part of their Contingency Support duties. However, when there is a
  significant amount of airfield and/or aircraft activity, or when a large number of stage crews
  are planned, separate stage crew management teams (7E1AN UTC) will be deployed to
  perform this task.
  2.4.9. Contingency Support Element (CSE). CSEs consist of personnel and equipment
  providing a specific Contingency Support capability other than the core C2. They may be
  deployed as an element of a CRE or CRT, or as a small-scale, stand-alone entity.
  2.4.10. Airfield Survey Team (AST). An AST will be led by a core member certified to
  conduct airfield surveys. The airfield survey team chief tasked to conduct the survey will
  determine the composition of the AST. At minimum a 1C7X1 (Airfield Manager) will
  conduct the airfield survey. Other desired team members include; a TERPs qualified
  13MXX/1C1XX, a 32EXX/3E5X1 (Civil Engineer), a 2A5X1 (Maintenance Crew Chief)
  and a 2T2X1 (Air Transportation Specialist).
  2.4.11. In-Transit Visibility (ITV). Provides support personnel to set-up and operate ITV
  equipment at passenger and cargo on/offload locations.
  2.4.12. Joint Inspector Team (JI). The JI provides the air component of the joint inspection
  team for air land Contingency Support.
  2.4.13. Affiliation Training Team (ATT). An ATT provides instruction to airlift users in the
  areas of airlift planning, cargo load planning, and equipment preparation by instructing the
  equipment preparation course (EPC) and the airlift planner’s course (APC) to various airlift
  users. An ATT consists of one or two affiliation instructors. See Chapter 6 for detailed
  information on the AMC ALCP, ATT responsibilities and organizational structure.
16                                                           AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009


     2.4.14. Contingency Load Planning Team (CLPT). A CLPT helps an airlift user prepare and
     marshal the initial loads prior to the arrival of the first aircraft, provides on-the-spot training
     and quality control to the deploying organization. The CLPT may also provide limited C2
     management at locations where the airflow is minimal or sparsely scheduled. The CLPT will
     consist of three qualified affiliation instructors. A CRT Chief will be in charge of the CLPT
     and one of the three instructors must be Air Load Planning System (ALPS) certified.
     2.4.15. Communications Support Team (CST). A team of contingency response forces
     communications and air ground equipment personnel deployed to support another unit’s
     communications requirement. The team deploys under the supervision of a specially trained
     and certified NCO (7-level). When deployed in support of a specific mission or operation
     where no CR forces team is operating, they will report directly to the senior AMC/USAF
     representative. They normally remain under the OPCON of 18AF. The team chief will act as
     communications and computer security officer and will ensure computer security procedures
     are followed in accordance with USAF guidance. CSTs will coordinate with HQ AMC/A6
     SCTX Spectrum Management, 618 TACC or theater frequency manager as soon as possible
     to allow time to accomplish host nation coordination for all required radio frequencies and
     ensure these frequencies are available at the deployed location. AMCU communications,
     AGE, and support equipment will be transported under the positive control of a cargo courier
     at all times. HQ AMC/A3MM approval is required to transport equipment without escort.
     2.4.16. Air Traffic Control (ATC) and Special Tactics Teams (STT). STTs provide air traffic
     control and communications at forward area locations for airdrop or air/land operations and
     their OPCON resides within AFSOC. ATC will provide air traffic control and
     communications at forward area locations for air/land operations and will normally remain
     under the OPCON of 18AF.
2.5. Deployed Command and Working Relationships. When contingency response forces
arrive at their deployed operating location, the commander/team chief must establish positive
working and logistical relationships with in-place forces, host-base organizations, and airlift
users. Working relationships should be formalized in written memo or other document and
distributed to all parties involved. Normally, Base Operating Support (BOS) will be provided by
the host base or supporting components. Contingency response forces operating within an
AMD’s area of responsibility (AOR) will provide mission information, OPREPs and SITREPs to
the AMD. The following protocol applies to command relationships at deployed locations:
     2.5.1. Upon departing home-station, AMC contingency response forces (including ARC
     forces when gained by AMC) will be under OPCON of the 618 TACC.
     2.5.2. (For contingency response forces-only locations) The contingency response forces
     commander/team chief has responsibility for all tanker/airlift Contingency Support personnel
     and equipment. Personnel from other units tasked to support contingency response forces are
     normally temporarily attached and are under the control and authority of the
     commander/team chief.
     2.5.3. Contingency response forces and Special Tactics Teams (STT). The contingency
     response forces commander, if designated as the Senior Airfield Authority (SAA) at the
     deployed location (until relieved/replaced by an individual designated by the JFC), is
     responsible for the control, operation, and maintenance of an airfield to include the runways,
     associated taxiways, parking ramps, land, and facilities whose proximity affects airfield
AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009                                                                  17


   operations. This includes directing STT activities in support of airfield operations. However,
   operational control of the STT remains with Special Operations Command while the
   contingency response forces commander has tactical control (TACON) of the STT for a
   specified duration.
   2.5.4. Air expeditionary wing/air expeditionary group (AEW/AEG) and contingency
   response forces locations. Often contingency response forces are deployed to an operational
   location where multiple deployed C2 units are operating or where they will be replaced by
   other forces. Normally, a location with an identified unit bed down requirement will deploy
   an AEW/AEG. At these locations contingency response forces will retain their deployed unit
   structure, designation, and commander when there is no CHOP. Unless otherwise outlined in
   OPORD or through combatant commander (COCOM) agreement, the contingency response
   forces commander is responsible for all collocated air mobility units and for those missions
   and tasks directed by 18AF/CC through the 618 TACC. Team integrity must be maintained
   for redeployment/forward deployment mission requirements.
   2.5.5. Contingency response forces and theater bases. Contingency response forces can
   deploy to permanent or contingency airfields hosted by a theater USAF unit commander. The
   host unit may provide much of the Expeditionary Combat Support required for base tenant
   units, to include messing, tents, sanitation facilities, showers, etc. While contingency
   response forces may not fall under the host base commander for administrative command or
   operational authority, contingency response forces should assist in establishing and
   maintaining the airfield or base camp with manpower and equipment not essential to the air
   mobility mission when possible. Safety and availability of essential equipment dictates that
   the duty duration for personnel is reasonable and equipment is not abused or used in any
   manner that could adversely impact the mission.
2.6. Conflict Resolution. Problems that adversely affect safety, morale, or mission
accomplishment should be brought to the attention of the commander exercising OPCON
through appropriate channels. The 618 TACC MSC or Director of Mobility Forces-Air
(DIRMOBFOR-Air) may assist with resolution. If problems cannot be resolved through these
channels, elevate to the next higher level.
2.7. Command and Control. The 618 TACC Mission Support Cell (MSC) maintains 24-hour
connectivity to all mission support operations and maintains visibility of deployed mission
support forces. Its primary responsibility is to ensure each deployed contingency response forces
team arrives at its assigned operating location on time with the proper equipment and personnel,
it can sustain operations for the duration of the mission, and it can return to home station in a
timely manner. For each deployed operating location, the MSC will coordinate with the deployed
commander/team chief operating hours, procedures, and required actions. The MSC collects
information on airfield capability, limitations, and status. The MSC will coordinate equipment,
resupply, and repair requirements for deployed locations with 618 TACC/XOCL, and will assist
with coordination of airlift to the deployed location. The MSC also coordinates personnel, legal,
financial, diplomatic, and security issues, for deployed contingency response forces teams. The
MSC will maintain a global awareness of all contingency response force operations and provide
information received to other 618 TACC functional areas for planning and critical operational
decisions. Issues directly related to airlift and tanker operations (e.g. aircraft movement,
maintenance problems, crew availability) should be reported to, and coordinated with, 618
TACC XOPC/XOPM (or air operations center) as appropriate.

                                            Chapter 3

                                         OPERATIONS

3.1. Introduction. This chapter provides policy and guidance for contingency response forces
pre-mission planning, deployment, execution, redeployment, and operational reports.
3.2. Policy. Numerous factors determine the scope of an operation. Among those considerations
are strategic/theater airlift flow, threat conditions, location, quarters, messing, etc. contingency
response forces will be responsible for accomplishing all taskings until the operation or exercise
terminates, or released by 618 TACC/XOP/controlling agencies. The following policies will be
used for planning deployment operations:
     3.2.1. Mission Prioritization. AMCUs will manage support for deployed operations and
     affiliation training using the JCS priority system found in Joint Publication 4-01, Appendix
     A, paragraph 4. Within the JCS guidance, the priorities are as follows:
        3.2.1.1. Phoenix Banners/Silvers,      Contingencies/Humanitarian      Relief,   and    618
        TACC/XOP directed standby status.
        3.2.1.2. JCS exercises and pertinent planning conferences
        3.2.1.3. JAATTs / SAAMs
        3.2.1.4. Affiliation Training
        3.2.1.5. All                                  other                           taskings
        NOTE: AMCUs may short-fall affiliation training for Phoenix Banners, contingencies,
        humanitarian relief, and 618 TACC/XOP directed standby status. However, units may
        only short- fall one instructor position without prior approval from HQ AMC/A3M.
     3.2.2. Weapons. Contingency response forces must be prepared to deploy with weapons
     when directed. Qualified Weapons Couriers will be appointed in writing for deploying
     forces. All personnel deploying with weapons will be briefed prior to departure on the use of
     deadly force and rules of engagement.
        3.2.2.1. The commander/team chief will ensure provisions are made for the appropriate
        clearing procedures while at the deployed location to include; instruction cards for
        weapons clearing (IAW AFMAN 31-229, USAF Weapons Handling Manual), designated
        clearing areas and clearing barrels.
        3.2.2.2. Prior to deployment, all personnel will be trained IAW AFI 31-207, Arming And
        Use of Force by Air Force Personnel, on the Air Force use of force policy and training
        documented in the individual ancillary training folder. CJCS Standing Rules of
        Engagement or theater-specific rules of engagement will be briefed prior to deployment.
        In addition, Unit Training Managers (UTMs) will ensure personnel are properly trained
        in their assigned weapon(s), as annotated in the AF Form 522, USAF Ground Weapons
        Training Data, and the unit Master Arming List, prior to issue. For duty requiring
        members to be armed when not in uniform, authorization to bear arms must be
        documented on AF Form 523, Concealed Carry Permit.
AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009                                                                   19


   3.2.3. Uniform. The appropriate uniform for the deployed location will be at the discretion
   of the commander/team chief, consistent with AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance
   of Air Force Personnel, the tactical situation, the Foreign Clearance Guide, and the
   COCOM/Joint Task Force (JTF) commander’s policy. Performance of duty in civilian
   clothes is normally specified in the tasking message. However, the commander/team chief
   may authorize the wear of civilian clothing based on security requirements, host nation
   sensitivities or requests, or other conditions that might cause diplomatic incidents or adverse
   publicity.
   3.2.4. Force Protection. The commander/team chief is responsible for ensuring security of
   resources under the contingency response force’s control at deployed locations. This may be
   provided by local police forces, security forces, sister service/coalition forces, host nation
   forces, or contingency response force personnel as deemed adequate by the commander/team
   chief. The commander/team chief shall further incorporate security forces, intelligence, Air
   Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), Civil Engineer, and medical personnel under
   their command into a Force Protection Cell for their deployed location. This deployed cell
   will keep the commander/team chief abreast of force protection requirements and concerns.
   Additional forces will be deployed as mission dictates.
   3.2.5. Other functional areas should be considered as the mission dictates.
   3.2.6. ARC Funding. ARC forces tasked to support deployed operations will be MPA
   funded. MPA funding will be used for personnel participating in primary positions and other
   mission related activities such as conference attendance, airfield survey, planning, and
   completion of post mission reports. Personnel in training must be unit funded. ARC forces
   will coordinate with their respective headquarters prior to submitting MPA requests.
3.3. Tasking, Planning and Sourcing. USTC receives requirements for air mobility operations
support from combatant commands and other agencies. Once validated by USTC, the taskings
are passed to the 618 TACC and A3MM for further review and to validate the effects desired by
the requester. Once validated, the taskings are sourced through coordination of the 618
TACC/XOP and A3MM Functional Area Manager (FAM). The A3MM FAM will coordinate
with the sourced AMCU on the appropriate manpower and equipment necessary. All exercise
requirements will be coordinated through A3MM for validation and sourcing.
   3.3.1. Planning. The 618 TACC/XOPM is responsible for facilitating crisis action planning
   with the FAMs.
   3.3.2. Sourcing. All AMC or AMC-gained contingency response forces will be sourced
   through coordination of the 618 TACC/XOP and AMC/A3MM. USAFE/PACAF CRG
   forces, ANG, and AFRC AMCUs availability/utilization will be considered during the
   sourcing process.
       3.3.2.1. The 618 TACC/XOP and A3MM must coordinate with the theaters, AFRC and
       ANG to eliminate redundancies in sourcing.
       3.3.2.2. Availability and utilization of ANG and AFRC forces will be coordinated with
       the appropriate HQ AFRC/A3TC and NGB/A3.
   3.3.3. Preparation for Deployment:
20                                                         AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009


        3.3.3.1. Contingency response forces must be ready for aircraft loading within 12 hours
        (36 hours for ARC) of receipt of tasking. Units will maintain 24 hour coverage by
        qualified personnel to receive taskings/directives from the appropriate authority. The
        sourced AMCU will conduct mission planning and may request specific manpower and
        equipment requirements for contingency response forces deploying to a particular
        location IAW paragraph 2.6.6.1.
        3.3.3.2. The AMCU is responsible for ensuring that pre-departure planning is complete
        and adequate to accomplish the mission while providing for the well-being of the
        deployed personnel. Each deploying commander/team chief will assemble and brief all
        deploying personnel prior to departure on the mission objective, operating environment,
        and individual preparation required for deployment. Those who cannot be personally
        briefed will be informed sufficiently prior to departure to accomplish any items needed
        for preparation.
     3.3.4. Unit pre-departure planning will include, but not be limited to operating environment,
     mission requirements, and contingency response forces’ support requirements as follows:
        3.3.4.1. Operating environment:
            3.3.4.1.1. Collecting all relevant data [Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG)
            classified/unclassified), flight information processing system (FLIPS), Global
            Decision Support System (GDSS) Giant Report, AMC Form 174, Geo Reach, after
            action reports, etc.] on the operating location.
            3.3.4.1.2. Area intelligence and threat analysis.
            3.3.4.1.3. Determining level of host base support and restrictions.
            3.3.4.1.4. Security/Force Protection requirements and restrictions (for personnel,
            equipment, aircraft, and communications security [COMSEC] materials).
            3.3.4.1.5. Arming of personnel and rules of engagement.
            3.3.4.1.6. Storage of weapons and classified materials.
            3.3.4.1.7. Special requirements such as clothing, translators, passports/visas, specific
            vehicle operation qualifications.
            3.3.4.1.8. Tactical Ballistic Missile Warning requirements and procedures.
            3.3.4.1.9. Chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high yield explosives
            (CBRNE) Warfare Threat.
            3.3.4.1.10. Friendly forces and their relationships to Global Mobility Forces.
            3.3.4.1.11. Legal considerations (SOFA, host-nation laws, etc.).
        3.3.4.2. Mission requirements:
            3.3.4.2.1. Proposed airflow, parking/working MOG, mission concept of operations
            (CONOPS)/Operational order (OPORD) .
            3.3.4.2.2. Flight following, flight management, and crew control requirements
            3.3.4.2.3. Aircraft support requirements (e.g. fuel, liquid oxygen (LOX), power carts,
            AGE).
AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009                                                                     21


          3.3.4.2.4. Weather observing and forecasting support.
          3.3.4.2.5. Crash, fire, rescue.
          3.3.4.2.6. Internal and external communications plan (reference following website to
          get the communications request completed and sent to 618 TACC/XOP for further
          coordination
          https://618TACC@scott.af.mil/directorates/sct/SCT_files/commsupport.doc).
          3.3.4.2.7. Safety equipment and procedures.
          3.3.4.2.8. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD).
          3.3.4.2.9. Aerial Port operations (MHE, ITV, JI, special handling and passenger
          services).
      3.3.4.3. CR forces’ support requirements:
          3.3.4.3.1. Sustainability (meals, water, fuel, and sanitary facilities).
          3.3.4.3.2. Billeting, meals, and transportation.
          3.3.4.3.3. Contracting.
          3.3.4.3.4. Advance funding for TDY expenses and unit costs.
          3.3.4.3.5. Area health and medical concerns.
          3.3.4.3.6. Emergency medical care for Air Force personnel.
          3.3.4.3.7. Uniform and individual mobility bag and professional gear requirement.
          3.3.4.3.8. Identifying specific deployment and redeployment airlift requirements.
   3.3.5. Airlift Planning. IAW AFMAN 24-203, Preparation and Movement of Air Force
   Cargo, command planners will ensure that contingency response forces defined within this
   instruction will both deploy and redeploy under Chapter 3 guidelines in order to prevent
   ―mission readiness‖ from being negatively impacted. This guidance will be included in the
   remarks section of the AMC Form 59, Mission Directive. Waiver authority for AFMAN 24-
   203 resides within HQ AMC/A4.
   3.3.6. Equipment Preparation and Accountability. Equipment shipping documentation will
   be prepared IAW AFMAN 24-203 by certified individuals. Units will ensure certified
   individuals are available to prepare equipment and documentation for redeployment at
   deployed location. Units will ensure positive control of equipment during deployment actions
   and appoint qualified deployed equipment custodians prior to deployment, as required.
   3.3.7. Annex 1, AMCI 10-202V4, Contingency and Wartime Mobility Airfield Operations
   Management, CL1 further expands upon planning and deployed operational mission
   considerations associated with contingency response functions.
3.4. Deployed Operations.
   3.4.1. Positioning. Contingency response forces’ commanders/team chiefs must evaluate all
   factors and determine when to be in place. For on-load locations, contingency response
   forces should be in place no later than 48 hours prior to arrival of the first scheduled aircraft
   (24 hours for offload locations). Large scale operations may require positioning an advance
22                                                           AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009


     team 3 to 10 days prior to the operation. During emergency or contingency operations,
     contingency response forces may be required to work missions immediately upon arrival at
     the operating location. 618 TACC mission planners and commanders/team chiefs must
     coordinate force arrival requirements to ensure that forces arrive in time to safely support the
     mission. As a minimum, all efforts must be made to put contingency response forces on the
     first arrival aircraft and/or in place at least 3 hours prior to the scheduled arrival of the first
     aircraft to be supported.
     3.4.2. Arrival Actions. The contingency response forces’ commander/team chief is
     responsible for establishing a working relationship with the host airfield commander or
     manager. This should include familiarization with permissible operating areas and hours,
     operational restrictions, and confirmation of the operation’s planning factors. Special interest
     should be placed on airfield safety and security, runway/taxiway obstructions,
     runway/taxiway conditions, airfield lighting, weather condition reporting, emergency
     notification, and hazardous cargo marshalling and parking areas. Further, the
     commander/team chief should verify emergency medical support, health, sanitation, and
     confirmation of Tactical Ballistic Missile Warning procedures as soon as possible. The
     commander/team chief must initiate actions to secure billeting and messing facilities for all
     assigned personnel, and must have positive accountability of all personnel and equipment
     arriving on station and maintain an awareness of unit capability and readiness.
     3.4.3. Daily Operations. Operating hours for contingency response forces will be established
     by the deployed commander in coordination with host nation, JTF, JFAC, AOC, and 618
     TACC.
        3.4.3.1. Frequently, contingency response forces are the only US personnel on station.
        As such, they are highly visible and their actions have far reaching diplomatic
        consequences for the United States. Commanders, team chiefs, supervisors, and senior
        NCOs should be selected based on their demonstrated good duty performance,
        professional conduct on and off-duty, good judgment, cultural awareness for the customs
        and sensitivities of the host nation, ability to exercise tact and diplomacy in their dealings
        with others, and proven effectiveness in exercising their supervisory responsibilities. 618
        TACC/XOP or appropriate controlling agency, along with the deployed commander/team
        chief, have the responsibility and authority to direct the immediate return of any person to
        home station who engages in misconduct or whose continued presence or conduct may
        otherwise reflect poorly on the USAF or the United States. A detailed report of the facts
        and basis for returning the individual to home station should be provided to the
        appropriate authority and to the individual’s unit commander. Unit commanders will take
        appropriate action to address the misconduct or other matter.
        3.4.3.2. The Tactical Operations Center (TOC) is the focal point of contingency response
        operations. It serves as the command, control, and communications center for deployed
        operations. The commander/team chief coordinates the activities of airfield management,
        command and control, information management, administrative specialists,
        communications, ramp coordinators, contracting and finance, ATC, quick turn
        maintenance, supply, AMC asset security, and airfield security and all other assigned
        UTCs. Access to the TOC will be limited to personnel essential to controlling operations
        (as designated by the commander/team chief). The TOC will be protected to level 1 and 2
AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009                                                                23


     threats in accordance with AFJI 31-102, Physical Security, and AFI 31-101, The Air
     Force Installation Security Program (FOUO).
        3.4.3.2.1. The contingency response force’s commander will appoint a liaison officer
        for interagency/international relations if necessary. The commander may also appoint
        a TOC director to coordinate staff activities.
        3.4.3.2.2. The crew control section of the TOC dispatches aircrew transportation,
        provides aircrew briefings and weapons storage, issues aircrew brochures, makes
        billeting assignments, orders computer flight plans, maintains the aircrew stage,
        answers telephone queries as to expected alert times, maintains all aircrew records,
        and alerts and briefs aircrews. On medium and large-scale contingency response
        forces deployments, it is recommended that crew control be a separate function from
        the TOC.
        3.4.3.2.3. Communications network equipment will be established in the TOC to
        provide C2 connectivity and internal team communications. This may include, but is
        not limited to: high frequency (HF), ultra-high frequency (UHF) and very high
        frequency (VHF) air-to-ground communications equipment, satellite communications
        equipment, mobile giant voice equipment and a land-mobile radio net. Secure and
        HAVEQUICK capabilities will be available during all JCS exercises and non-training
        operations. CR forces will utilize call signs, code words, and chatter-mark procedures
        as outlined in OPORD, CONOPS, SPINS and ATO.
        3.4.3.2.4. Depending on the requirement, some contingency response forces positions
        may not need to deploy. For example, weather capabilities may already exist on the
        host airfield.
        3.4.3.2.5. Normally, supply and the petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL) activities
        are incorporated into the maintenance function. On medium and large scale Global
        Mobility Forces operations, combining flight line AGE personnel, special and general
        purpose vehicle repair personnel, and AGE drivers into a pool (with the responsibility
        for all daily equipment inspections, including vehicles) is advisable. Not only do
        these personnel have the expertise to accomplish the tasks, but will have the
        responsibility for the required daily inspections if tasked by the commander/team
        chief.
        3.4.3.2.6. The aerial port operations function is generally organized along normal
        fixed port operations lines. Functions to be activated are determined by workload
        requirements. Functions may include, but are not limited to, air terminal operations
        center (ATOC), air cargo section, air passenger section, ITV, and JI.
           3.4.3.2.6.1. Where arrival/departure airfield control groups (A/DACG) are
           involved, they work very closely with aerial port personnel. It is advisable to have
           a CR forces representative in the A/DACG and an A/DACG representative in the
           aerial port section. Effective communications between the two (such as land-
           mobile radios or field phones) is essential. Similar working relationships should
           be established with Marine Corps embarkation battalions and USAF deployment
           control centers (DCC).

        3.4.3.2.7. Unless the threat condition dictates the need for a security forces team, an
        Anti-Terrorism Level II certified Force Protection coordinator will normally be
        deployed. The coordinator will evaluate the situation, interface with any existing
        security forces, and assist the contingency response forces commander in determining
        the need for security force measures or augmentation.
     3.4.3.3. Contingency response forces are designated the C2 agency controlling all air
     mobility aircraft, crews, and support forces at or transiting the deployed operating
     location. Any request for waivers or deviation from operational directives must be
     coordinated with HQ agencies through the 618 TACC or AMD, if established.
     3.4.3.4. Safety of personnel, aircraft, equipment, and timely accomplishment of the
     mission is the responsibility of the commander/team chief. If conditions exist that might
     cause injury, loss of life, or damage to aircraft or equipment, the commander/team chief
     may terminate all operations until the problems can be corrected.
        3.4.3.4.1. Contingency response forces will coordinate with host airfield manager to
        ensure Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) program established IAW guidance found
        in AFPAM 91-212, Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard Management Techniques.
        3.4.3.4.2. Commander/team chief will ensure Foreign Object Damage (FOD)
        prevention procedures are adequate for airflow and operating environment. Program
        will be established if non-existent and specific limitations/hazards concerning FOD
        will be relayed to mission planners at 618 TACC and/or AMD.
     3.4.3.5. The deployed equipment custodians are responsible to ensure equipment is
     maintained and utilized correctly. Equipment will be utilized by qualified individuals and
     equipment should not be utilized by non-contingency response forces. Equipment
     custodians will monitor the status of equipment and inform the commander/team chief
     upon any change in operational status.
        3.4.3.5.1. To protect personnel from harmful contact and vapor hazards, ensure that
        contamination of equipment and vehicles with chemical, biological, and/or
        radiological warfare agents (and subsequent decontamination attempts) is
        documented in maintenance forms and lifecycle historical records. The ―Red C‖
        symbol will be used IAW T.O. 00-20-1 and the AMC Counter- Chemical, Biological,
        Radiological, and Nuclear Concept of Operations (AMC C-CBRN CONOPS).
     3.4.3.6. The commander/team chief will maintain information on the current location and
     status of all deployed personnel and equipment. Within 24 hours of initial arrival, and
     whenever a change occurs thereafter, or at the direction of the 618 TACC MSC or AMD,
     the commander/ team chief will provide a Deployed Personnel and Equipment Report
     (DP&E). See Attach A2.4. for report formats.
     3.4.3.7. The commander/team chief will approve and send a daily Situation Report
     (SITREP) to 618 TACC/XOP MSC/controlling agency and the AMD (if established)
     IAW Para 3.6.3.
     3.4.3.8. The commander/team chief will establish an area security plan, including
     emergency notification, personnel accountability procedures, duress codes, security
     response actions, higher headquarters notification, an emergency destruction plan for
AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009                                                                   25


      classified materials, and Tactical Ballistic Missile warning. If personnel are deployed
      with weapons, the security plan will include emergency combat actions and regular
      reviews of the rules of engagement and the use of deadly force.
      3.4.3.9. The commander/team chief is directly responsible for the health, well being, and
      actions of their personnel. A medical emergency plan will be developed to handle
      accidents or illness that might occur either at the operating site or in the billeting area.
      The plan should include an emergency movement and treatment plan for serious
      accidents and should establish a process for conducting daily disease surveillance to
      provide early detection of unusual disease trends that may suggest a biological warfare
      attack.
      3.4.3.10. The commander/team chief will ensure that air mobility operations at an
      airfield contaminated with chemical, biological, or radiological agents are conducted in
      accordance with the AMC C-CBRN CONOPS. Due to the difficulty in completely
      decontaminating large-frame aircraft, contamination avoidance must be practiced to the
      maximum extent possible. Commanders/team chiefs will advise senior leadership of the
      presence of contamination, operate in clean areas to the maximum extent possible, and
      limit the upload of contaminated or formerly contaminated cargo to prevent cross
      contamination of aircraft. The term ―formerly contaminated‖ means that decontamination
      has been attempted. Regardless of the level of decontamination achieved, residual
      contaminates (undetectable with currently fielded detectors) may remain. Therefore,
      specific higher-headquarters authorization to airlift this cargo will be required.
      3.4.3.11. CRE/CRT Mobile C2 Responsibilities. In addition to the duties and
      responsibilities outlined in the above paragraphs, the commander/team chief will ensure
      the following items are accomplished whenever mobile C2 capabilities are present within
      the deployed contingency response forces:
          3.4.3.11.1. Operational Reporting (OPREP) accomplished within theater guidance
          and IAW with AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting.
          3.4.3.11.2. Ensure flight following information updated (AMC Form 356, Movement
          Flow Chart).
          3.4.3.11.3. Establish Events Log.
          3.4.3.11.4. Daily monitor Air Tasking Order (ATO) and special instructions (SPINS)
          for changes.
          3.4.3.11.5. Execute Quick Reaction Checklists (QRCs) as required.
          3.4.3.11.6. Coordinating Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs) as required.
3.5. Roll-Up and Redeployment.
   3.5.1. Contingency response forces commanders/team chiefs will develop procedures for the
   orderly phase-down of operational capability (commensurate with the planned airflow
   requirements) and for the redeployment of all personnel and equipment. Redeployment airlift
   requirements identified earlier should be verified and airlift availability reconfirmed. The
   commander/team chief will forward a roll-up plan to 618 TACC/XOP controlling agency and
   the AMD if established. See Attachment A4.1 for report format.
26                                                         AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009


     3.5.2. Roll-up and Redeployment load plans will be forwarded to HQ AMC 618 TACC/XOP
     MSC or controlling agency (info AMD if established) as soon as possible after arrival at the
     deployed location. In cases where contingency response force assets are CHOPed to a theater
     commander, airlift requests for the roll-up need to be validated by the supported commander
     in the JOPES PID database 21 days prior to movement IAW CJCSM 3022.02, JOPES
     VOLUME III. This report should be updated as required. Sequentially number reports. See
     Attachment A4 for format. The commander/team chief is responsible and accountable for
     ensuring that all equipment and personnel depart the deployed location with valid shipping or
     travel arrangements to home station or follow-on tasking locations. If individuals are
     detained for legal or diplomatic reasons or equipment seized or impounded by the host
     nation, contact the 618 TACC/XOP MSC or AMD, if established, for assistance and
     direction.
     3.5.3. Particular attention must be paid to the host airfield commander or manager's final
     perceptions of the USAF. All borrowed or joint-use equipment must be returned in a clean,
     serviceable condition and operations areas must be cleaned and restored to their original (or
     better) condition. Commander/team chief should also personally meet with key host officials
     to resolve any final problems or unfinished business. All financial obligations of the US
     government must be paid or satisfactory arrangements made to ensure that obligations will be
     taken care of in an appropriate and timely manner. Commander/team chiefs must comply
     with host nation diplomatic and security requirements during roll-up.
     3.5.4. Transfer of equipment to theater or follow-on forces should only be accomplished
     during extreme circumstances. Coordination with 618 TACC/XOP (or controlling agency),
     AMC/A3, and home station AMCU must be completed before any contingency response
     forces’ equipment is left behind or transferred to theater or follow-on forces. All transfer
     authorizations must be received/approved through the appropriate HQ AMC functional.
     Additionally, theater/follow-on forces must be authorized to receive/accept and be fully
     qualified on the equipment to be transferred. A complete inventory listing quantity and serial
     numbers of equipment shall be completed, a signed receipt will be completed, and home
     station equipment accounts will be updated before a funding transfer takes place per

                    SELECTION, TRAINING, AND QUALIFICATION

4.1. General. Deployed contingency response forces are temporary mission support
organizations who function as an extension of AMC C2. The term ―Core personnel‖ refers to
AMCU authorized/assigned personnel who are assigned against deployable UTCs. Personnel
requirements will be consistent with the personnel requirements prescribed in AMCPAM 10-
405, AMC Deployment, and Redeployment Guide for Base Operating Support.
4.2. Selection and Qualification of Personnel. Personnel selected for assignment to an AMCU
should have a minimum of three years of retainability to accommodate the multitude of
additional training requirements. Members will fill deployment UTCs based upon their AFSC,
training, qualification and/or certification regardless of in-garrison duty title or position.
   4.2.1. Commanders/flight chiefs and superintendents will review inbound assignments to
   ensure personnel meet requirements and are suitable to perform the mission.
       4.2.1.1. Personnel with a physical profile that would prevent or exempt them from
       worldwide mobility requirements will not be assigned to an AMCU. Personnel who
       cannot deploy and perform required tasks due to permanent or long-term physical
       limitations or restrictions will be considered for reassignment or separation.
       4.2.1.2. Personnel who cannot meet mobility requirements (passport, security clearance,
       etc.) or who become non-deployable and are already assigned will be identified to the
       AMCU commander and installation/MAJCOM/AFPC functional manager for that AFSC
       as required, for appropriate actions (PCA, reassignment if applicable, separation, etc.).
       Coordinate with HQ AMC/A3MM.
       4.2.1.3. Security clearance requirements. Mission requirements dictate AFSCs and
       quantities of Top Secret (TS) clearance needed by each AMCU IAW AFI 31-501,
       Personnel Security Management Program. All other AMCU personnel to include ARC
       personnel will have at least a Secret clearance.
       4.2.1.4. Officers considered for assignment to an AMCU should possess specific
       knowledge of AMC C2, and have background and experience in air mobility operations.
       Assigned officers must be able to plan, organize, deploy, employ, redeploy, and lead
       squadron size organizations in support of operations at deployed locations. Enlisted
       personnel being considered for assignment to an AMCU unit manpower document
       (UMD) position must possess the AFSC, grade, skill-level, and preferably the special
       experience identifier (SEI) assigned to that position (N/A AFRC).
       NOTE: Reference AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution, for utilization of 3-
       level personnel.
       4.2.1.5. Non-certified AMCU personnel may be assigned against UTC line numbers
       provided there is a redundancy of certified members on the team.
       4.2.1.6. Aircrew currency or qualification has no effect on eligibility to perform
       deployed duties provided member meets criteria in paragraphs 4.2.1.1., 4.2.1.2., 4.2.1.3.
       and 4.2.1.4.

        NOTE: ARC aircrew may maintain flight currency in any type of AMC aircraft as
        determined by the AMCU/CC or OG/CC.
     4.2.2. Position description. All personnel will support the mission and their team regardless
     of functional specialty. Although responsible for the primary function, each may be tasked to
     work in various roles and capacities to meet mission requirements (cross-functional training).
     Commanders remain responsible to ensure personnel are trained and safely utilized for their
     assigned tasks.
        4.2.2.1. CRE Commanders/Operations Officers. CRE Commanders and Operations
        Officers are responsible for effective C2 and support of deployed air mobility operations.
        CRE Commanders will be rated officers with extensive air mobility experience. Waivers
        to this requirement will be IAW Paragraph 1.10 and 1.10.1 of this instruction. Non-rated
        officers assigned to an AMCU should have ample background in air mobility operations
        before being considered for upgrade to CRE Operations Officer. These non-rated officers
        will be assigned against their functional UTCs, but may be entered into upgrade training
        for CRE Operations Officer at the discretion of the AMCU commander. Substitution of
        non-rated officers for UTC line numbers requiring a rated officer may be made on a case-
        by-case basis and approved by the highest level AMCU commander. The non-rated
        officer must be fully qualified in the deployed duty position and will not simultaneously
        deploy in their primary AFSC function.
        4.2.2.2. Loadmasters and Boom Operators. Each active duty AMCU should have at least
        one loadmaster and boom operator from each airlift/tanker aircraft. ARC aircrew may
        maintain flight currency in any type of AMC aircraft as determined by the ALCF/CC or
        OG/CC.
        4.2.2.3. Airfield Management. Airfield management personnel will have a thorough
        understanding of airfield management operations including airfield operating restrictions
        and criteria, airfield survey, obstacle evaluation criteria, airfield inspections, flight
        planning, notices to airmen (NOTAM), airfield lighting and markings, Bird Air Strike
        Hazard (BASH) avoidance, and flight line safety. Airfield management personnel
        requiring additional training in these areas must receive that training from a qualified
        airfield manager prior to deploying in a UTC line number. Additionally, airfield
        managers may be cross-functionally trained to perform other functions in support of
        deployed operations. Recommend completion of the USAF’s Chief, Airfield Management
        Course.
        4.2.2.4. Command and Control. Command and control personnel must have a thorough
        understanding of AMC mission management and mission monitoring; emergency
        management and crisis actions; and OPREP reporting. They must be able to operate C2
        systems to report or extract information on missions that transit their deployed location.
        Command and control personnel must also be proficient in aircrew management, crew
        duty time restrictions, diplomatic clearance, and operational reporting in addition to
        mission/flight following reporting. Personnel will complete initial training from a fixed
        command post. Commanders must coordinate with the local command post to set up
        training schedules for proficiency training. Additionally, command and control personnel
        may be cross-functionally trained to perform other functions in support of deployed
        operations.
AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009                                                               31


     4.2.2.5. Personnel Specialist. Personnel specialist assigned to AMCUs will be part of the
     in-garrison commander’s support staff and will work closely with the commander,
     superintendent, and first sergeant to ensure personnel actions help ensure unit staffing
     levels and readiness. When deployed, actions will focus on PERSCO strength reporting
     to ADCON and OPCON agencies IAW established directives.
     4.2.2.6. Communications Maintenance (SEI 191). Communications Maintenance
     personnel will have a basic understanding of military radio theory, fault isolation and
     troubleshooting techniques, flight line safety, and the Air Force Composite Tool Kit
     (CTK) Program. Once assigned, all active duty and select ANG/AFRC personnel will
     attend and successfully complete the Advanced Mobile C2 Communications Course prior
     to deploying in a UTC line number. Training for all remaining ANG/AFRC
     Communications Maintenance personnel will be in accordance with agreement between
     HQ AMC/A3M and ANG/AFRC FAMs. Communications Maintenance personnel may
     also attend formal course identified for the supported Wideband SATCOM system, the
     USAF Expeditionary Center (USAF EC) Generator and USAF EC Environmental
     Control Unit (ECU) courses, but these courses are not mandatory for Communications
     Maintenance duty .
     4.2.2.7. AGE (SEI 191). Assigned personnel must attend both the USAF EC generator
     and USAF EC ECU courses prior to deploying in a UTC line number. AGE personnel
     must also obtain EPA Type II refrigeration certification prior to attending the USAF EC
     ECU course. AGE personnel should attend these courses at the USAF EC every 24
     months. AGE personnel may also attend the Advanced Mobile C2 Communications

Managers will then identify shortcomings of an individual's training and schedule future
deployments accordingly. For example, a 1A271 may be CRT-qualified but not have deployed as
a CRT team chief for over 18 months, thus requiring a deployment or refresher training for
proficiency.
     4.7.1. Flight proficiency training. All personnel in authorized active flying positions (as
     specified in the unit personnel management roster) will maintain flight proficiency and flight
     currency IAW AFI 11-2 (Aircraft MDS), Vol I, Aircrew Training. This includes required

     aircrew skills and proficiency, and build flight experience. Flight records will be maintained
     by the unit to which the individual is attached. Personnel who are non-current for grounding
     items in accordance with AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program, will
     not perform primary aircrew duties, but can perform Global Mobility duties.
     4.7.2. Command and Control (1C3X1) and Operations (1C7X1) personnel. In addition to
     contingency response proficiency training, 1C3X1 personnel must remain proficient in their
     AFSC. To accomplish this, personnel will train in local units. Units should allow for a
     minimum of 16 hours of training per quarter. (ANG and AFRC personnel may attend
     refresher and proficiency training as necessary.) The AMCU commander/flight chief will
     have final authority to withdraw a person from training (only after completion of a scheduled
     shift or with at least 8 hours notification before a scheduled shift), when mission
     requirements dictate. The AMCU training section will coordinate with the base airfield
     manager or command post superintendent to establish a training agreement and schedule
     (Memorandum of Understanding). Document training in the individual's AF Form 623, On-
     the-Job Training Record, in accordance with AFI 36-2201V3.
     4.7.3. Air Transportation personnel. In addition to contingency response proficiency
     training, Air Transportation Personnel will maintain currency and proficiency through
     participation with the local aerial port. Currency and proficiency guidance is provided by HQ
     AMC/A4 and AMCI 24-101V18 in coordination with HQ AMC/A3MM.
     4.7.4. Aircraft Maintenance personnel. In addition to contingency response proficiency
     training, Aircraft Maintenance Personnel will maintain currency and proficiency through
     participation with the local maintenance function or by going off station as required by
     availability of required MDSs. Currency and proficiency guidance is provided by HQ
     AMC/A4 and AMCI 21-104, Aircraft Maintenance Training, in coordination with HQ
     AMC/A3MM.
     4.7.5. Proficiency Training for ANG and AFRC units. Proficiency training for all positions
     will include participation in at least one contingency response exercise or operation every 18
     months, measured from the last day of the last deployment.
4.8. Currency, Qualification, and Proficiency. Units will ensure members maintain currency,
qualification, and proficiency for each duty position. As a minimum, members remain current in
their primary duty position until the last day of the 18th month following their last off-station
deployment in that position. To maintain the highest level of readiness, units will coordinate
with AMC/A3MM to develop appropriate proficiency training tables for each duty position and
will outline the training in the wing Operating Instruction. For extended gaps in training,
qualification is lost when a member has not deployed in their primary duty position for 3 years.
AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009                                                                 45


The following paragraphs outline certain duty positions that may regain currency by means other
than an off-station deployment.
   4.8.1. CRE Commander/Operations Officer Currency. Currency is achieved by

   sufficient.
   4.8.4. AST Currency. AST Currency is achieved by accomplishing an airfield survey.
   4.8.5. ATT/CLPT Currency. ATT/CLPT Currency is achieved by instructing an Affiliation
   Class or by accomplishing a CLPT deployment. ATT/CLPT members remain current within
   12 months from the most recent event.
   4.8.6. CSE Team Chief Currency. There is no currency for CSE team chief qualifications.
   Personnel must maintain other currencies as outlined in this chapter.
   4.8.7. Loss of Currency. Once currency is lost, members must successfully complete an in-
   house AMCU-directed academic program designed for that specific qualification.
   Additionally:
   4.8.8. CRE Commanders must accomplish an off-station CRE deployment with a current
   and qualified CRE Commander Instructor.
   4.8.9. CRE Operations Officers must accomplish an off-station CRE deployment as a CRE

     4.9.1. CFETP Supplement. Individuals mandated to maintain a CFETP (Training Business
     Area or hard copy IAW functional area requirements) will supplement the CFETP with
     contingency response training documentation in a manner that maintains the six-part Global
     Mobility format outlined in Table 4.2. In the event an individual achieves SNCO status and a
     CFETP is no longer required, the contingency response specific training documentation
     should be moved to a separate training folder as described in 4.5.5 Individual Training
     Folder. If a CFETP is not required, an individual training folder is established as a six-part
     binder or equivalent, constructed using the format outlined in Table 4.2. The training
     documentation may be computer generated or maintained in a computer database, provided
     the AMCU establishes a standardized plan for all duty sections. Documentation of all
     training requirements and accomplishments is the joint responsibility of the individual, the
     trainer and the unit training office.

                                            Chapter 5

                         STANDARDIZATION AND EVALUATION

5.1. Purpose and Scope. The Standardization and Evaluation program is the commander’s tool
to first, ensure personnel are trained to published standards and remain proficient in their
respective functional areas and secondly, validate the unit’s mission readiness and effectiveness,
to include documentation of individual qualifications and capabilities. Unless otherwise noted,
waiver authority for the requirements defined in this chapter resides with the CRW commander
for active duty units. AFRC and NGB will develop tailored programs and processes to meet the
objectives listed below. Specific program objectives are:
     5.1.1. Develop and ensure standardization of operational procedures not specifically
     addressed in AF/ Command guidance. This includes: Contingency Response Elements,
     Contingency Response Teams, Contingency Support Elements, Communications Support
     Teams, Airfield Survey Teams, Air Mobility Liaison Officers (AMLO), Affiliation Training
     and Stage Management.
     5.1.2. Ensure compliance with appropriate operational, training, and administrative
     directives.
     5.1.3. Evaluate and revise operational directives, procedures, and techniques as required.
     5.1.4. Provide a system to assess individual qualifications, proficiency and capability to
     accomplish assigned contingency response functions.
     5.1.5. Recognize trends and recommend/initiate changes to operational procedures, training
     programs and directives.
     5.1.6. Ensure standardized training programs and procedures to provide qualified personnel
     to accomplish Expeditionary Air Mobility Support Operations regardless of unit of
     assignment (active duty, ANG or AFRC).
5.2. Responsibilities.
     5.2.1. Stan/Eval Visits. HHQ Stan/Eval staffs may visit units during the administration of
     formal inspections, Staff Assistance Visits (SAVs) or in an informal capacity.
        5.2.1.1. Contingency Response Force Standardization/Evaluation Visit (CRFSEV):
            5.2.1.1.1. Purpose. CRFSEVs are the principle tool for evaluating contingency
            response forces operations and verifying safe and effective mission accomplishment.
            This is achieved through contingency response force testing and task evaluations to
            ensure compliance with approved operational procedures and applicable special
            interest items. Additionally, the effectiveness of unit Stan/Eval and Training
            programs are evaluated to ensure compliance and standardization among contingency
            response units, and provide meaningful feedback to unit commanders.
                5.2.1.1.1.1. HQ AMC CRFSEV teams may request augmentation from units or
                user-commands. The HQ AFRC NAF/A3 should augment teams for CRFSEVs
                on their respective AFRC units, and may be asked to augment any CRFSEV team.
                AFRC augmentee support will be coordinated through HQ AFRC NAF/A3.
AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009                                                               49


       5.2.1.1.2. CRFSEV Testing. CRFSEV team will administer an open book
       examination to all available qualified CRE/CCs, CRE Ops Officers, CRT Chiefs,
       Assessment Team members, CSE Chiefs, contingency response Ops Controllers,
       contingency response Communications members, contingency response AGE
       members, and RAMPCOs in the grade of O-5 and below. All personnel attached to
       the wing or below will test. Test individuals who are qualified in more than one of the
       above positions in their primary UTC.
          5.2.1.1.2.1. CRFSEV Tests will be derived from a minimum of 85% MQF
          questions, with the balance coming from local MIFs and directives. MQF
          questions will be developed by Contingency Response units IAW paragraph
          5.4.3. and submitted to AMC/A3M. AMC/A3M will develop CRFSEV tests from
          all unit provided question banks.
          5.2.1.1.2.2. The CRFSEV team will report the names of individuals tested and
          their scores to the unit commander. The final CRFSEV report will list the average
          of test scores by UTC position and the overall average test score.
              5.2.1.1.2.2.1. The CRFSEV team chief may elect to send the CRFSEV test
              after formal CRFSEV notification but before arrival of the CRFSEV team. In
              this case, the unit will identify a ―trusted agent‖ to control the CRFSEV test
              content and conduct unit testing, or as specified by CRFSEV team chief.
       5.2.1.1.3. Primary CRFSEV Task Evaluations. HQ AMC examiners will administer
       task evaluations to senior Wing (or equivalent) Stan/Eval personnel for each of the
       unit’s assigned missions.
          5.2.1.1.3.1. If any senior Stan/Eval personnel are scheduled to change within 3
          months following a CRFSEV, administer evaluations to designated replacements.
          5.2.1.1.3.2. Credit may be taken for CRFSEV task evaluations on local and off-
          station SPOT evaluations administered by HQ AMC examiners on AMC-directed
          deployment, re-deployment, operational and local training exercises within 90
          days of the designated start date of the CRFSEV. CRG/CC approval is required
          when conducting operational or local evaluations before the scheduled CRFSEV
          for ANG and AFRC contingency response units.
       5.2.1.1.4. CRFSEV Requirements:
          5.2.1.1.4.1. CRFSEV Scheduling/Notification. AMC CRFSEV teams will
          normally visit units approximately every 40 months for unit-equipped active duty
          units and approximately every 60 months for unit-equipped ANG and AFRC
          units. Associate unit (active duty and ARC) visits will be the same frequency
          (and usually concurrent) with their unit-equipped host unit. Active duty AMC
          CRFSEVs should be conducted in conjunction with the unit’s AMC Logistics
          Stan/Eval Program (LSEP) inspection. ARC Contingency Response unit’s
          CRFSEV should be aligned with their parent unit’s Aircrew Stan/Eval Visit
          (ASEV). Official unit CRFSEV notification will be sent to the unit not less than
          90 days prior to the scheduled visit. The notification message will include
          CRFSEV team composition, transportation requirements, special interest items,
          and other details of the visit. Initial planning dates for unit CRFSEVs are
50                                                   AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009


            coordinated with AFRC and NGB IG and A3 counterparts, and are published
            semi-annually in the AMC/IG Command-wide Inspection Schedule and posted on
            the AMC/A3M CoP. Unit scheduling conflicts should be reported to HQ
            AMC/A3MM for resolution; all changes will be coordinated with the respective
            MAJCOM, with final approval by HQ AMC/A3.
        5.2.1.1.5. Task evaluations should represent a cross section of the unit’s operational
        mission. All of the Contingency Response unit’s personnel filling UTC positions
        listed in paragraph 5.2.1.1.2. may be asked to accomplish specific tasks for their
        qualification to assess proficiency and compliance to applicable regulations. CRFSEV
        evaluations may be administered up to and including 90 days prior to the beginning of
        the CRFSEV.
            5.2.1.1.5.1. CRFSEV teams will complete all documentation for evaluations
            conducted before departure.
        5.2.1.1.6. CRFSEV grading. A unit-level overall CRFSEV grade will be awarded. At
        the conclusion of the visit, the CRFSEV team chief will provide feedback (oral or
        written) to the unit commander and staff. In addition, HQ AMC/A3 or designated
        representatives will release a CRFSEV written report following review/endorsement.
        CRFSEV teams will identify those areas not in compliance with current guidelines
        and include as ―required improvements‖. Units will report corrective action to
        AMC/A3M within 90 days after receiving the final report. This report will be in the
        form of an official memorandum signed by the unit’s wing/group commander to HQ
        AMC/A3M. It will provide specifics on what corrective action was taken to resolve
        each of the ―required improvements‖ to bring each of the designated areas into
        compliance.
            5.2.1.1.6.1. Individual programs will be awarded a grade using the following
            scale:
                5.2.1.1.6.1.1. Outstanding: Program exceeds all requirements with no
                significant discrepancies.
                5.2.1.1.6.1.2. Excellent: Program exceeds most requirements with few
                deviations noted.
                5.2.1.1.6.1.3. Satisfactory: Program meets requirements with some deviations
                noted.
                5.2.1.1.6.1.4. Marginal: Program meets most requirements with significant
                discrepancies noted.
                5.2.1.1.6.1.5. Unsatisfactory: Major discrepancies noted that degrade program
                effectiveness.
        5.2.1.1.7. CRFSEV Results. Approved unit CRFSEV Reports are posted on HQ
        AMC/A3M CoP.
     5.2.1.2. Staff Assistance Visits.
        5.2.1.2.1. AMC/A3M (AFRC NAF/A3 for AFRC units and NGB/A3 for ANG) will
        conduct scheduled Mid Term CRFSEV Staff Assistance Visits (SAVs) at the
AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009                                                                51


        approximate half-way point between CRFSEVs. Notification of the SAV will be sent
        to the unit approximately 45 days prior. SAVs may include any Stan/Eval or training
        related area the unit requests.
        5.2.1.2.2. AMC/A3M will normally not conduct a SAV in the 6 month period prior
        to a Stan/Eval inspection.

     5.5.1. Administration. The evaluation program is designed to verify successful training
     completion and that individuals are ready to conduct operations unsupervised. All
     evaluations will be conducted by personnel certified as evaluators in the CJQS area being
     evaluated. Evaluations will be recorded on a Letter of Evaluation and Certification (see
     Attachment A3.1.) and certified by the Unit Commander at the R&C Board.
     5.5.2. Evaluation Requirements. Accomplish all Global Mobility mission evaluations IAW
     this paragraph.
        5.5.2.1. Completion of the following CJQSs requires evaluations prior to certification:
        CRE Commander, CRE Operations Officer, Contingency Response Team Chief, Ramp
        Coordinator, Airfield Survey Team Chief and ACLP Instructor.
        5.5.2.2. IAW Para 5.10., commanders may direct a requirement for an evaluation before
        certification for other duty-positions including instructor or evaluator qualifications.
        5.5.2.3. Certification of an individual in a CJQS requiring an evaluation without
        completion of an evaluation will only be accomplished in extraordinary circumstances.
        Requests for waiver will be submitted to Standardization and Evaluation for
        recommendation and forwarding to CRW/CC or equivalent (highest level AMCU/CC in
        chain of command for ARC). With this commander’s approval, request will be forwarded
        to HQ AMC/A3 for resolution. ARC may devise their own procedure.
        5.5.2.4. Requirements for QA and ATSEV evaluations are IAW applicable
        AF/Command directives.
     5.5.3. Types of Evaluations.
        5.5.3.1. Mission Evaluations. All members will successfully complete a mission
        qualification evaluation upon completion of any CJQS as outlined in paragraphs 5.5.2.1.
        and 5.5.2.2. Some mission evaluations require successful completion of an examination
        (see Para 5.4.3.). Record this evaluation on a Letter of Evaluation and Certification.
        5.5.3.2. No-Notice Evaluations. Commanders may direct evaluations at any time for
        personnel in their unit. Record this evaluation on a separate Letter of Evaluation and
        Certification.
        5.5.3.3. Requalification Evaluations (IAW Table 4.2). Individuals previously qualified in
        Global Mobility operations who have lost currency for less than 3 years may receive a
        requalification evaluation after applicable local training is complete. Individuals beyond
        3 years will complete initial training and receive a qualification evaluation for the
        applicable position. Individuals may receive a requalification evaluation following de-
        certification after corrective training (if applicable).
            5.5.3.3.1. The unit commander will determine if the member requires a
            requalification evaluation after a de-certification. If required, the evaluation will be
            recorded on a separate Letter of Evaluation and Certification.
            5.5.3.3.2. If the member does not require a requalification evaluation, the commander
            will certify the member as re-qualified on a separate Letter of Evaluation and
            Certification.
AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009                                                                    63


     5.5.3.4. Spot Evaluations. Unit commander may direct evaluations targeting specific
     areas but not all aspects of a mission. These evaluations shall be identified as Spot
     Evaluations and recorded on a separate Letter of Evaluation and Certification.
  5.5.4. Evaluation Grading Policies. When evaluation of a required area is not possible, the
  area may be verbally evaluated. Evaluators will make every effort to evaluate all required
  areas during the evaluation before resorting to this provision. If an alternate method is used to
  complete the evaluation, document in the comments portion of the Letter of Evaluation and
  Certification. Use of this provision must be approved by the examinee’s commander.
  5.5.5. Evaluation Grading System. A two-tiered grading system is used to evaluate and
  document performance. Individual scores are recorded for examinations while areas/subareas
  of performance are individually graded against established evaluation criteria. Performance
  less than fully qualified is documented. An overall qualification level is determined from the
  compilation of these individual scores/grades.
     5.5.5.1. This section does not pertain to QA and ATSEV evaluations. Reference
     paragraphs 5.4.7. and 5.4.8. for QA and ATSEV grading systems.
     5.5.5.2. Area/Subarea Grades. In the absence of criteria from AF/Command directives,
     Standardization and Evaluation Office will establish areas and subareas to be evaluated
     and the appropriate grading criteria for those areas/subareas. Areas will have a two-level
     (Q/U) or three-level (Q/Q-/U) grading system. The overall area grade will be the lowest
     of any subarea grade awarded.
         5.5.5.2.1. Qualified (Q). Q is the desired level of performance. The examinee
         demonstrated a satisfactory knowledge of all required information, performed duties
         within the prescribed tolerances and accomplished the assigned mission.
         5.5.5.2.2. Qualified Minus (Q-). Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the
         assigned area tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the
         evaluator. Deviations from established standards must not exceed the prescribed Q-
         tolerances or jeopardize safety.
         5.5.5.2.3. Unqualified (U). Assign a U area grade for any breach of discipline,
         performance outside allowable parameters or deviations from prescribed
         procedures/tolerances that adversely affected mission accomplishment or
         compromised safety. An examinee receiving an area grade of U normally requires
         additional training. When, in the judgment of the evaluator, additional training will
         not constructively improve examinee’s performance, it is not required. In this case,
         the evaluator must thoroughly debrief the examinee.
     5.5.5.3. Critical Areas. Critical areas require adequate accomplishment by the member in
     order to successfully achieve the mission objectives. Critical areas are graded either ―Q‖
     or ―U‖.
         5.5.5.3.1. Critical areas are identified by ―(Critical)‖ in the area title and shading of
         the ―Q-― block on the Evaluation Worksheet (See Attachments A3.7. thru A3.9.).
         5.5.5.3.2. As a minimum Safety, operational risk management (ORM), Judgment,
         and Emergency Procedures are considered Critical Areas for all Global Mobility
         mission evaluations.
64                                                       AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009


        5.5.5.4. Qualification Levels. Overall evaluation performances are graded by
        qualification levels as follows:
            5.5.5.4.1. Qualification Level 1 (Q-1). The member demonstrated desired
            performance and knowledge of procedures, equipment and directives within
            tolerances specified in the grading criteria. This will be awarded when no
            discrepancies were noted and may be awarded when discrepancies are noted if:
               5.5.5.4.1.1. The discrepancies resulted in no U grades being given in any
               area(s)/subarea(s).
               5.5.5.4.1.2. In the judgment of the evaluator, none of the discrepancies preclude
               awarding of an overall Qualification Level 1.
               5.5.5.4.1.3. All discrepancies noted during the evaluation were cleared during the
               debrief.
            5.5.5.4.2. Qualification Level 2 (Q-2). The member demonstrated the ability to
            perform duties safely, but:
               5.5.5.4.2.1. There were one or more area(s)/subarea(s) where additional training
               was assigned.
               5.5.5.4.2.2. A non-critical area/subarea grade of U was awarded.
               5.5.5.4.2.3. In the judgment of the evaluator, there is justification based on
               performance in one or several areas/subareas.
            5.5.5.4.3. Qualification Level 3 (Q-3). The member demonstrated an unacceptable
            level of safety, performance or knowledge.
               5.5.5.4.3.1. An area grade of U awarded in a critical area requires an overall Q-3
               for the evaluation.
               5.5.5.4.3.2. An overall Q-3 can be awarded if, in the judgment of the evaluator,
               there is justification based on performance in one or several areas/subareas.
     5.5.6. Conduct of Evaluations.
        5.5.6.1. Evaluators will pre-brief the examinee on the conduct, purpose, requirements of
        the evaluation, and all applicable evaluation criteria. Evaluators will then evaluate the
        examinee in each graded area/sub area.
        5.5.6.2. Evaluators will normally not evaluate personnel they have primarily trained,
        recommended for upgrade, which they supervise, or who write their
        effectiveness/performance reports. Deviations must be approved by the examinee’s
        commander and the Standardization and Evaluation Office chief.
        5.5.6.3. An evaluation will not be changed to a training mission to avoid documenting
        substandard performance, nor will a training mission be changed to an evaluation.
        5.5.6.4. Early termination of an evaluation (an incomplete evaluation) for any reason will
        be clearly documented on the CJQS evaluation worksheet with a course of action
        recommended to complete the evaluation.
AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009                                                                  65


     5.5.6.5. The judgment of the evaluator and the guidance provided in this instruction will
     be the determining factors in assigning an overall qualification level. The evaluator will
     thoroughly critique all aspects of the evaluation. During the critique, the evaluator will
     review the examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations, and any additional training
     required. Evaluator will debrief examinee and the examinee’s supervisor.
     5.5.6.6. In the event of unsatisfactory performance, the evaluator will recommend
     additional training requirements to the AMCU/CC. Required additional training should
     not be accomplished on the same mission.
     5.5.6.7. Re-evaluations will normally be administered by an evaluator other than the one
     who administered the original unsatisfactory evaluation. Deviations must be approved by
     the examinee’s commander and the Standardization and Evaluation Office chief.
  5.5.7. Unsatisfactory Performance. Conduct a thorough post-mission debriefing to the
  examinee and applicable team members on all aspects of the evaluation.
     5.5.7.1. The evaluator will immediately correct breaches of safety during an evaluation.
     5.5.7.2. Notify the examinee’s commander, or designated representative, whenever
     unsatisfactory (Qualification Level ―Q-3‖ for QA and ATSEV) performance is observed.
     5.5.7.3. Evaluators observing unsatisfactory performance by a team member other than
     the examinee will correct the member and provide feedback, if warranted.
     5.5.7.4. AMCU commanders will direct re-evaluations if in the opinion of the evaluator
     the unsatisfactory performance warrants not certifying the individual in the evaluated
     duty position. Required items for re-evaluations will be determined by the AMCU
     commander after considering the evaluator’s recommendations. Re-evaluations may be
     completed in-garrison and should be completed within 30 days of the date of the failed
     evaluation.
  5.5.8. Incomplete Evaluation. Evaluators will make every effort to prevent an incomplete
  evaluation from occurring. It is possible that circumstances beyond their control may result in
  an incomplete evaluation. The evaluator will take every action possible to complete as many
  items as possible during the evaluation.
     5.5.8.1. The evaluator will evaluate all items accomplished and document on the Letter
     of Evaluation and Certification those items required to complete the evaluation. Any
     critical item graded unsatisfactory will trigger requirement for a complete re-evaluation.
     Letter of Evaluation and Certification will be completed to document the failed
     evaluation and a separate Letter of Evaluation and Certification will be completed for the
     re-evaluation.
     5.5.8.2. The evaluator completing the evaluation will ensure all items required to
     complete the evaluation are accomplished and will document completion of the
     evaluation by signing the incomplete Letter of Evaluation and Certification in the
     evaluator’s block.
     5.5.8.3. If possible, the evaluator for the incomplete evaluation should be the same one
     used to complete the evaluation. If this is not possible, the evaluator completing the
     evaluation will completely review the incomplete evaluation Letter of Evaluation and
     Certification to ensure all items will be accomplished.
66                                                         AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009


5.6. Letter of Evaluation and Certification Completion and Management. Use the Letter of
Evaluation and Certification along with other documents to record and to certify member
qualification as demonstrated in all evaluations. See Attachment A3.1. for format.
     5.6.1. Identify examinee’s name, grade and organization. Use the unit designation and
     location that the examinee is assigned to or attached to. When attending a FTU course in
     which an evaluation is administered, the organization and location will reflect the FTU
     organization/location. Examinees assigned to HHQ may use their office symbol in place of
     the unit designation.
     5.6.2. Identify the duty position for which the evaluation was given. Enter the examinee’s
     highest qualification in that particular duty position demonstrated during the evaluation.
     NOTE: Examiner is not a qualification, it is a certification, and should only be entered when
     demonstrated during the evaluation, e.g., a Spot Evaluation in which the examinee receives
     an evaluation while administering an evaluation.
     5.6.3. If an examination is required to complete an evaluation, the score will be annotated in
     the Letter of Evaluation and Certification. Enter failed examination score with successfully
     completed score as follows: ―63/98‖.
     5.6.4. Mission descriptions will be annotated and should be of sufficient detail to verify that
     the significant required areas for the evaluation were accomplished. Mission descriptions
     should outline the ―profile‖ of the evaluation stating type/location of TDY/deployment phase
     and specific mission data. Mission data includes number of personnel on TDY/deployment,
     number of aircraft worked, amount of cargo/passengers/aeromedevacs, etc. Comments
     addressing specific areas in which instructional ability was demonstrated are mandatory for
     all evaluations of instructors.
        5.6.4.1. If two or more TDYs/events are required to complete an evaluation, the
        examiner completing the evaluation signs the Letter of Evaluation and Certification.
        5.6.4.2. If more than one examiner was involved in administering the evaluation,
        examiners other than the one signing will enter remarks describing those parts of the
        evaluation they evaluated and sign a signature block immediately adjacent their remarks.
     5.6.5. If recommending additional training, the evaluator will annotate a due date for that
     training not to exceed the last day of the second month following the event requiring
     additional training (e.g. 26 Jan 05 evaluation, 31 Mar 05 due date).
     5.6.6. Reviewing and Approving Officers. Reviewing Officers ensure all the requisites of the
     evaluation were met and the evaluation profile, garrison and TDY/deployment phases, was
     adequate enough to justify the qualification level assigned by the examiner. The Approving
     Officer awards the duty position certification to the examinee.
        5.6.6.1. The Reviewing Officer will be the AMCU Operations Officer as a minimum.
        5.6.6.2. For evaluations where the Operations Officer is being evaluated the reviewing
        Officer will be the AMCU Commander.
        5.6.6.3. The Approving Officer shall be the AMCU Commander or higher.
        5.6.6.4. For evaluations where the AMCU/CC is being evaluated the Approving Officer
        will be the Group or Wing Commander.
AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009                                                                   67


      5.6.6.5. For evaluations where the Group Commander is being evaluated and for all CRE
      Commander, CRT Chief, AST Chief, and CSE Chief evaluations the CRW/CC, or as
      annotated in Table 5.1., shall be the Approving Officer.
      5.6.6.6. For formal course evaluations at a FTU, the reviewing and approving officers
      will be assigned to the FTU.
      5.6.6.7. The Reviewing and Approving Officers will ensure the recommended additional
      training is adequate to correct the noted deficiencies.
      5.6.6.8. If a Reviewing or Approving Officer does not agree with the evaluator's overall
      rating, the overall grade will not be changed. The Reviewer or Approver will mark the
      "Do Not Concur" and will annotate comments above their signature block.
   5.6.7. All Letters of Evaluation and Certification and De-Certification Letters will be sent by
   the AMCU’s SELO to the Standardization and Evaluation Office.
      5.6.7.1. De-Certification Letters are prepared when necessary as outlined in Chapter 4
      and using guidelines of Attachment A3.2. of this instruction.
   5.6.8. The Standardization and Evaluation Office will develop procedures for maintaining
   evaluation and waiver documentation for the entire organization.
      5.6.8.1. The Standardization and Evaluation Office will maintain all training and
      evaluation waivers, Letters of Evaluation and Certification, and De-Certification Letters
      for an individual until 6 months after the individual’s departure date for a permanent
      change of assignment to a unit other than another AMCU or a permanent change of
      station.
      5.6.8.2. When an individual undergoes a permanent change of assignment to a unit other
      than another AMCU or a permanent change of station, the Standardization and
      Evaluation Office will prepare a memorandum for record documenting all evaluations
      and de-certifications the individual has undergone. This memorandum will be given to
      the individual and a copy kept for 6 months past the departure date.
      5.6.8.3. Memorandums documenting waivers to Training and Standardization and
      Evaluation guidance and regulations should be kept by Standardization and Evaluation
      Office and a copy kept in the individual’s training folder.
5.7. CRE Commander Evaluation Profile. All CRE/CC evaluations will assess examinee’s
pre-deployment, employment, re-deployment, and post deployment actions. See Attachment
A3.7. for evaluation worksheet. Examinee will perform the following items:

          AMC AFFILIATED CONTINGENCY LOAD PLANNING PROGRAM

6.1. General. The AMC Affiliated Contingency Load Planning Program (ACLP) is designed to
develop a mutual understanding of air mobility requirements and capabilities for AMC aligned
units. ACLP helps foster an informed, professional, and cooperative management environment
for users of military airlift. This program provides affiliation classroom training and airlift load
planner training/certification. Limited airlift capability combined with the rapid response
required for global mobility, puts increased responsibilities on the airlift user. In order to assist in
becoming more self-sufficient when preparing for air movement, ACLP was devised to increase
management awareness and involvement, provide technical information, quality assistance, and
feedback to airlift customers. The affiliation relationship, once aligned and established at all
working levels, promotes this concept through staff visits, formal classroom training, staff
planning validation, and joint participation in mobility operations. If assistance is required for
rapid global mobility purposes, this aligned relationship provides the AMC airlift customer
timely mobility expertise through the 7E1AQ Contingency Load Planning Team. This two man
planning team consists of highly qualified load planning specialists who have firsthand
knowledge of the aligned unit’s specific mobility requirements. Preplanning, early identification
of air mobility requirements, and identification of potential problems help ensure a smooth flow
of cargo, personnel, and aircraft. Program objectives are directed toward one goal; improving
mission readiness for affiliated units. This is accomplished by teaching airlift users how to
efficiently and safely plan, prepare, and quickly deploy by air with minimal Air Force assistance.
NOTE: This program does not provide for hazardous cargo certification, automated load
planning system, or AMC C2 procedures training.
6.2. Objectives.
   6.2.1. To establish a relationship between airlift managers and using agencies to optimize
   airlift planning, utilization, mission capabilities and requirements by:
       6.2.1.1. Providing a joint training program to enhance planning and execution, ensuring
       rapid and efficient movement by air.
       6.2.1.2. Reducing user reliance on Air Mobility mission support.
       6.2.1.3. Providing a Contingency Load Planning team for AMC aligned units to assist in
       rapid global mobility requirements.
6.3. Affiliation. The term affiliation is defined as the relationship between an AMCU and the
aligned affiliated unit. This relationship provides the avenue necessary for unit level coordination
between             HQ              AMC            and           the          airlift          user.
NOTE: All units executing training under the ACLP must have HQ AMC/A3MM approval.
6.4. Affiliate Alignment Requests. Airlift users will send initial requests for affiliate alignment
to HQ AMC/A3MM. Validation will be based on the unit’s propensity to deploy on AMC airlift
under AMC dedicated airlift requirements outlined IAW DoD restrictions. Cargo size, unit size,
load planner requirements, and deployment frequency are determining factors and are submitted
along with other commitments requiring AMC airlift support. Once validated and approved, HQ
AMC/A3MM will identify an AMCU to be affiliated with the requesting unit. For ARC units,
74                                                        AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009


AMC's recommendation for affiliation will be sent to the respective ARC headquarters for final
determination. The ARC headquarters will then accomplish affiliation alignment and
notification. The ARC will inform HQ AMC/A3MM of its final decision. If alignment is
disapproved, training can still be accomplished. AMC/A3MM provides the airlift user with
information on ―space available‖ training and AMCU POC’s for scheduled classes.
6.5. Affiliate Types. Each unit is assigned an Affiliate Type (Table 6.1.). Types I, II, III, and IV
align CRWs with active duty units. Type V units can be active duty or ARC units. Types VI and
VII designate ARC units. The affiliate type controls the amount and frequency of training the
user unit will receive to maintain its deployment capability IAW HQ AMC requirements. The
affiliate type does not relate to the unit’s JCS or mission priority.
6.6. Type Rating Change/Removal. Affiliate units that have not participated in ALCP for a
period of two years, or who’s mission has changed and no longer requires ACLP training, will be
removed from ACLP or have their type rating changed. HQ AMC A3MM, ARC and AMCU
ACLP managers recommend changes or removal of type ratings. ACLP managers forward
written requests for a change/removal of type rating to HQ AMC/A3MM for final approval.

Table 6.1. Affiliate Training Types and Authorized Training Frequencies.
Type Training                 Authorized Frequency
I                             5 x per fiscal year
II                            2 x per fiscal year
III                           1 x per fiscal year
IV                            when affiliated unit is scheduled to participate in known operations
V                             as needed (see note 3)
VI (ARC)                      1 x per fiscal year
VII (ARC)                     when affiliated unit is scheduled to participate in known operations
NOTES:
1. ―Just in Time‖ or special training needs for all type ratings will be considered on a case by
case basis and are subject to instructor availability. Requests will be coordinated through HQ
AMC/A3MM for approval/disapproval.
2. Individual unit Affiliate Type is validated and published by HQ AMC/A3MM during the
initial training approval process and revalidated every 18 months.
3. Type V Applies to units affiliated with HQ AMC and to units that have a classroom training
requirement and a wartime tasking but are not entitled to an aligned unit relationship.
6.7. Activities. The following are considered the minimum activities necessary to ensure an
effective program. Air Mobility Liaison Officers (AMLOs) should participate in these activities
to the maximum extent possible.
     6.7.1. Initial Visits. Newly aligned units should receive a personal welcome by the AMCU
     affiliation manager or representative. Visits provide staff assistance, command orientation,
     and an opportunity to establish a rapport between AMCUs and airlift users. Visits should
     include a briefing to the unit commander; logistics personnel, mobility officers, NCOs, and
     A/DACG embark battalions, or DCC personnel. The briefing should provide an overview of
     AMC's organization, capabilities and limitations, deployment procedures, and the importance
     of the Equipment Preparation and Airlift Planners’ Course. It should focus on the units’
     mission, deployment requirements, the interface between its air mobility planners, and AMC
AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009                                                                 75


  mission support forces while discussing the roles and capabilities of each to include
  procedures for requesting ACLP assistance. The working relationship between the unit's
  deployment control unit (A/DACG, embark battalions, DCC) and the AMCU should be
  thoroughly described. AMCUs will discuss the specifics of ACLP training to include the type
  of training offered (EPC/APC), class request procedures, student authorization for training
  prerequisites, load planner currency tracking, staff assistance availability, and ACLP tasking
  procedures. Affiliation visits should be conducted when requested by the airlift user
  commander, when significant changes in staff or organization occur, or once every 18
  months (as a minimum).
  6.7.2. Sister Service School Quality Control Visits. AMC/A3MM will align each Sister
  School to a CRW via a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). CRWs will interface
  annually with Sister Service Schools that conduct Affiliation training via a Quality Control
  Visit. The visit ensures adherence to prescribed AMC standards. As a minimum, the
  associated CRW will conduct an annual instructor observation and observe new instructor
  certifications. New instructors will complete the ATT JQS to AMC standards IAW AFI 36-
  2201V5, Air Force Training Program Career Field Education and Training, and comply
  with                                     existing                                    MOUs.
  NOTE: Document Sister Service School visits and forward a copy via e-mail to HQ
  AMC/A3MM with a list of current qualified instructors. CRWs will ensure Sister Service
  School visits are funded IAW Para 6.7.6.2.
  6.7.3. Instructor Assessment. The AMC Affiliation Manager and AMCU Affiliation
  Managers will conduct periodic instructor assessments. The AMC Affiliation Manager is
  responsible for assessing CRW, AFRC NAF and NGB affiliation managers. Travel/per diem
  funding for HQ AMC assessments will be provided by the CRW affiliation program budget.
  The HQ AMC Affiliation Manager will coordinate instructor assessments 30 days prior to
  the scheduled class start date to allow time for travel order processing. AFRC NAF affiliation
  managers are responsible for assessing AFRC instructors. The NGB/A3 will serve as the
  affiliation training office of primary responsibility (OPR) and coordinate actions with
  AMC/A3MM. HQ AMC/A3MM will coordinate and observe ANG affiliation courses and
  instructors as required. AMCU Affiliation Managers will document assigned primary
  instructor assessments annually. HQ AMC assessments count towards this requirement.
  Document assessments on an AMC Form 248, Instructor Evaluation Checklist, and place a
  copy in the member’s evaluation folder. AMCU managers will e-mail a list of qualified
  instructors to AMC/A3MM annually. If an instructor is de-certified, they will complete
  remedial training in the deficient area(s) of the AMC ACLP/affiliation CJQS and complete
  an evaluation prior to being signed off by the unit commander. For AFRC units, the AFRC
  headquarters OPR, the NAF OPR, or a designated representative will observe at least one
  affiliation course per AMCU every 24 months. Submit a written evaluation summary to the
  instructor, AMCU CC, AFRC NAF, HQ AFRC, and HQ AMC/A3MM.
  6.7.4. Computer-Assisted Load Planning. All Affiliation instructors will be proficient in
  computer-assisted load planning tools. The AMCU affiliation manager will assign one
  individual to work computer load planning development and usage issues. Each AMCU will
  maintain an electronic load list of the aligned unit’s deployable equipment, as well as the
  ability to transfer load plans electronically at home station and at each deployed location.
  Unit affiliation managers will secure AALPS (or current automated system) training for
76                                                         AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009


     affiliation instructors through the appropriate certified trainer. Funding will come from the
     CRW/ARC affiliation budget.
     6.7.5. Staff Assistance Visit (SAV). AMCU’s should provide aligned affiliates with a SAV
     when requested by the affiliated unit commander. The AMCU will make every attempt to
     align the SAV with scheduled affiliation training. The AMCU affiliation manager will be the
     POC for the visit. They will coordinate activities with the affiliated unit prior to the visit.
     SAVs fall into two distinct categories: mission planning validation and exercise quality
     assessments. Participation in the AMCU Affiliation Conference may satisfy the mission
     planning                               validation                                requirement.
     NOTE: Type V alignments do not require SAVs.
     6.7.6. Mission Planning Validation. AMCU’s provide their aligned units load planning
     assistance and unit specific load plan validation. A unit database will be established and
     maintained for ready use in a computer-assisted load planning system. When possible,
     AMCU’s will establish a data link with affiliated units for unit load plan validation using
     automated systems. If the assigned unit is unable to provide contingency load planning
     assistance to the aligned Affiliate unit, the Affiliate unit should immediately contact their
     AMCU ACLP manager. The shortfall will be channeled to AMC/A3MM/ARC functional
     managers for re-tasking. Every effort should be made to keep the tasking within the assigned
     unit for mission continuity. The AMCU’s inability to provide assistance may call for re-
     alignment of the affiliated unit to another AMCU. The information will be thoroughly
     reviewed by AMC/A3MM and ARC program managers.
        6.7.6.1. Exercise Quality Assessments. AMCU will provide assistance visits during
        selected mobility or deployment exercises, subject to instructor availability. AMCU
        personnel will assist inspectors or participants at the unit commander's discretion.
        Affiliation training managers will use the standard AMC/A3MM approved Exercise
        Quality Assessment Guide (see Attachment A3.9). Affiliation instructors determine if
        load plans are correct, note discrepancies, and assess equipment marshaling, preparation,
        and documentation procedures. On-the-spot instruction or correction may be provided at
        the discretion of the unit commander. Affiliation instructors will identify unsafe
        conditions or actions and intervene when necessary to prevent personal injury or damage
        to equipment. Prepare an after action report within 3 duty days upon trip completion.
        Submit reports to the supported unit, the AMCU commander, and AMC/A3MM.
        6.7.6.2. Funding. Funding for active duty AMCU personnel conducting an Exercise
        Quality Assessment, to include USAF EC cadre conducting courseware validation, is
        provided by the ACLP program budget. AFRC funding will be used for all affiliation
        activities involving their own service units and MPA for AMC Type V affiliates. One
        Exercise Quality Assessment every 18 months is authorized MPA per aligned unit.
        AFRC AMCU’s training ANG units and ANG AMCU’s training AFRC units are MPA
        funded. Other MPA funding will be determined by AMC/A3MM. Reserve and ANG
        units will not teach AMC funded affiliation classes to aligned units unless tasked by
        AMC. Prior to the release of MPA days, the AMCU affiliation manager will forward a
        request to their respective AFRC NAF headquarters for validation, who will then forward
        to AMC/A3MM for final approval. ANG units will forward requests for MPA to
        NGB/A30S for validation, who will forward to AMC/A3MM for final approval. The
AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009                                                                    77


       CRWs are responsible to provide funding for reproduction of classroom materials for all
       Type V and Sister School alignments as established by HQ AMC/A3MM directives.
6.8. USAF EC Courseware Validation. USAF EC cadre may conduct periodic courseware
validation and small group tryouts in a secondary instructor position. This allows validation of
the ACLP courseware development and instructor implementation. Prior coordination is required
with HQ AMC/A3MM/AFRC NAF/NGB NLT 45 days prior to the class start date. Validation
reports are due to the HQ AMC/A3MM/AFRC/NGB within 5 working days after completion of
the validation period.
6.9. Additional Planning Requirements. AMCU’s will assist affiliated units, when possible,
planning air mobility operations or participating in air deployment exercises. Affiliate units will
request assistance well in advance of the intended operation or exercise to allow sufficient time
for AMCU personnel scheduling and preparation. The AMCU should assist the affiliated unit in
understanding and determining their own unit specific requirements such as identifying
operational plans, support equipment availability at both on-load and offload locations, key
personnel, airlift related duties, and methods for developing and modifying movement priorities.
Further emphasis should be placed on load planning activities such as load preparation and
documentation, certification of hazardous materials, and load team composition and duties. The
affiliated unit should have a thorough understanding of any inter-service agreements affecting
operations at their departure airfield. Lastly, they should have an understanding of the AMCU
support available to them, and its limitations to include 7E1AQ Contingency Load Planning
assistance.
6.10. Affiliation Training. The core of ACLP is affiliation training provided through
classroom instruction. It provides a forum for the exchange of information in an informal,
working-level environment. Training is provided at the AMC aligned airlift user's facility.
Training facilities must meet AMC standards for an effective classroom environment. ACLP is
one course taught in two phases providing the student with the knowledge to safely and
efficiently plan unit airlift requirements. Phase I is a two day course covering equipment
preparation, weighing and marking procedures, basic center of balance calculations, and aircraft
and flight line safety. Phase II continues for the next six days with instruction in aircraft
characteristics, load planning, and manifest documentation requirements. All classes will be
conducted using the ACLP program lesson plans, guides, and handouts.
   6.10.1. Phase I (EPC). Phase I is designed for unit personnel that will participate in
   deployment equipment preparation and is a prerequisite for continuing to Phase II. The goal
   is to train unit personnel to prepare, load, and tie-down unit equipment on air mobility
   aircraft. It also provides basic weight and balance procedures and marshaling requirements
   necessary for Phase II. The course is presented during one day of academic instruction and
   one day of hands-on equipment preparation exercise using ACLPW 36-101 V1, the standard
   AMC syllabus, and visual aid packages. Phase I completion awards a training certificate that
   qualifies the student to prepare unit cargo for air shipment. Phase I graduates are encouraged
   to train other unit personnel in equipment preparation procedures. When feasible, a one-day,
   hands on training SAV may be conducted with the aligned unit provided AMCU program
   manager approval is granted no later than 30 days prior to the event. These training SAVs
   should be scheduled when requested by the aligned unit or in conjunction with a normal
   SAV, or Exercise Quality Assessments whenever possible. If possible, a static loading
   aircraft should be scheduled in conjunction with phase I. The practical experience gained in
78                                                         AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009


     preparing, marshaling, and loading equipment on an actual aircraft does much to reinforce
     the information presented in the classroom.
        6.10.1.1. Static Loaders for Phase I Training. Classroom training time will not be
        shortened or canceled to support static loader aircraft. To ensure effective use of the
        aircraft, the unit equipment tasked to support the practical exercise must arrive at the
        training site promptly and be configured for airlift. During the practical exercise, the
        entire unit will be involved in the training process. If possible, use the actual equipment
        that the unit will prepare for deployment. This affords the individuals responsible for
        equipment preparation, load consolidation, and transportation the opportunity to perform
        their duties in a supervised training environment. Inspect cargo using the DD Form 2133,
        Joint Airlift Inspection Record, prior to loading aboard the aircraft. When static load
        aircraft are not available, use universal loading simulators (ULS) to represent actual
        AMC-assigned air mobility aircraft. Any cargo having discrepancies on the DD Form
        2133, which cannot be corrected, will not be loaded on the static aircraft or ULS. The
        joint inspection team should consist of a representative from the deploying unit mobility
        office, A/DACG (installation mobility office), and selected students from the class.
        NOTE: cargo discrepancies on the DD Form 2133. As with actual unit moves, only
        cargo passing the joint inspection will be loaded on the aircraft or ULS. The primary
        instructor will use as much of the authorized aircraft ground time as possible to maximize
        training.
     6.10.2. Phase II (APC). Phase II is restricted to unit movement officers and supervisory
     personnel (E-5 and above or civilian equivalent) who are actively involved with the unit’s
     load planning process and who have successfully completed Phase I training. These certified
     individuals become the backbone of the unit’s contingency load planning capability should
     AMCU load planning support become unavailable. Students must have 12-months
     retainability with direct responsibility for airlift planning and execution of joint combat air
     mobility operations. Individuals who do not meet these criteria may be admitted with written
     verification from their commander or unit mobility officer stating that they have a valid need
     for the training. The course is six days of academic instruction using AMCW 36-101 V2, the
     standard          AMC           syllabus         and         visual       aid         packages.
     NOTE: Students who fail to progress will be considered for removal from course. This
     consideration is at the discretion of the primary instructor through coordination with the
     respective AMCU ACLP Manager.
     6.10.3. Comprehensive Examinations. AMCU’s will use written exams from the USAF EC
     approved courseware. The Phase I exam will be a 50 question open-book test. The Phase II
     exam will be a 30-question open-book test followed by an open-book aircraft load planning
     exercise. Students will have 1.5 hours to complete Phase I written examination, and 1 hour
     to complete the Phase II written examination. Students have 2 hours to complete final load
     plan examination. The minimum passing score for each exam is 80%. Exams will be scored
     separately. Students who do not achieve a minimum score of 80% on each exam will not be
     certified. There are no provisions for re-testing. Students who do not become certified may
     be rescheduled for the next available course.
     6.10.4. Deviations. Instructors will not deviate or modify course length, content, and
     examination format without coordination with HQ AMC/A3MM/NGB/AFRC NAF approval
AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009                                                                    79


   6.10.5. Class Size. Class size is regulated to provide an effective student to instructor ratio.
   The minimum class size for Phase I and Phase II is 10 students. Phase I will not exceed 50
   students and Phase II will not exceed 25 students.
       6.10.5.1. Phase I. Phase I classes of 10-25 students require one qualified instructor.
       Classes over 25 students require two qualified instructors. If units desire static-load
       training, they must submit a formal airlift request to HQ AMC/A3MM/NGB/AFRC NAF
       60 days in advance of the desired training date. For AFRC units, static-load training must
       be requested through the deployment review board (DRB) process. Static-load training
       should be held in conjunction with equipment preparation training, or a planned unit or
       base mobility exercise.
       6.10.5.2. Phase II. Phase II classes with 10-15 students require one qualified primary
       instructor. Affiliation instructor JQS upgrade training is authorized with one qualified
       instructor. The primary instructor provides training to the upgrade candidate, but
       maintains overall responsibility for teaching the class. Classes with 16-25 students
       require a primary and secondary instructor. Due to instructor workload with a large class,
       a qualified secondary instructor is required if JQS upgrade training will take place. HQ
       AMC/A3MM/NGB/AFRC NAF is the waiver authority for the above requirements.
6.11. Primary and Secondary Instructor. When two instructors are required for a class, the
AMCU affiliation manager will designate one (must possess 1AXXX AFSC) as the primary
instructor. Secondary instructors need only be ATT JQS certified. The primary instructor will be
responsible for ensuring all administrative duties before, during, and after return to home station
are complete. Additionally, the primary instructor is responsible for any operational issues that
come up during affiliation training. Operational issues include, but are not limited to, static
loader aircraft coordination, inadequate classroom environment/facilities that do not meet
minimum AF standards, and on and off-station reporting. Instructors will complete the ATT
CJQS and be recommended by the AMCU affiliation manager prior to being certified by the
commander. Affiliation instructors will complete the Contingency Load Planning Instructor
Preparation Course (CLIP) conducted at the USAF EC (PDS IAQ).
6.12. Training Cancellation. The primary affiliation instructor is authorized to cancel training
when objectives cannot be met and after consulting with the AMLO (if assigned), the installation
OPR for affiliation matters, NAF Affiliation manager (if applicable), the parent AMCU, and HQ
AMC/A3MM. Reasons include, but are not limited to; less than 10 students, unsuitable training
environment (Para 6.16.), insufficient equipment to support training needs, or delays in training
that preclude efficient use of remaining training time. HQ AMC/A3MM is the final approval
authority for cancellation.
   6.12.1. Student Availability. Students will be available for training at all times for the
   duration of the course. Host units will consider students to be in a TDY or TAD status for the
   entire course. Absences from affiliation training are not authorized. Students will not be
   scheduled to perform other duties to include OOD, CQ, or any other after-duty hours
   activities. Students scheduled for other activities or appointments will be immediately
   removed from training. The affiliation training day should align with the duty day of the host
   installation. If affiliation training for any training day ends before the end of the host
   installation duty day, students will be released to perform self-study. Exception: Students
   may be released to participate in physical training if it does not inhibit class objectives.

6.13. Certificates of Completion. Students successfully completing Phase I and II training will
be issued an AF Form 1256, Certificate of Training, signed by the unit commander or designated
representative. Students who complete Phase II will be issued an AMC Form 9, AMC Airlift
Load Plan Certification. A control number will be documented on the AMC Form 9. Use the
affiliated unit’s AMCU control number for short falls. The following procedures will be used
when creating the control numbers. Use the AMCU’s identifier, fiscal year the class is
scheduled, and the sequence number of the class being conducted. Example: control number
315-06-05 represents the 315th AMCU, FY 2006 and the fifth class in the fiscal year.
Certificates will note which phase was completed. Phase II certificates will include the
appropriate course identification personnel code (USAF PDS 9N1 or USMC code M9T). If other
services assign their own personnel code to Phase II, that code will be included on the certificate
for students assigned to that service. The primary instructor will coordinate with the host POC to
ensure the proper code is included on the Phase II certificate. The Sister Service Schools will use
their     own      control     numbers      as    outlined      in    the     respective     MOU.
NOTE: CRW’s will report Sister Service School class summaries to HQ AMC/A3MM.
6.14. Phase II Certification. Graduates of Phase II will be certified as aircraft load planners
with certification valid for 24 months. The AF Form 1256 and/or AMC Form 9 will serve as the
qualification source document.
6.15. Recertification Eligibility Period. Individuals may recertify 18 to 24 months after the
initial/latest certification. Recertification training should be conducted in conjunction with a
regularly scheduled affiliation training class. Affiliation managers will ensure recertification
training includes aircraft overview, open book examination (must score 80% or higher) and
aircraft load plan. The review is normally conducted concurrently with Phase I training to afford
students the opportunity to attend Phase II (if required). For personnel who do not meet the
provisions of this paragraph, recertification may be accomplished by completing AMC Phase II
or attending a sister service school.                 Waiver authority is HQ AMC/A3MM.
NOTE: 2T2X1 personnel actively involved in the load planning process require recertification
every 48 months. Affiliation instructors do not require recertification or recurring training if
they possess a current instructor evaluation AMC Form 248.
6.16. Classroom Requirements. The primary instructor will be the final authority on
classroom suitability. If the classroom does not meet minimum standards for an acceptable
learning environment, the instructor(s) will work with the unit POC and AMLO (if assigned) to
resolve any discrepancies. If the discrepancies cannot be resolved, considerations should be
given to class cancellation. Any class cancellation should be coordinated through HQ
AMC/A3MM. As a minimum, classrooms will have adequate lighting, environmental controls,
and sufficient workspace for each student. The minimum workspace for each student will be 36‖
x 36‖. Classrooms should have the ability to be secured when class is not in session. Normally,
the same classroom will be used for the duration of the course. Classrooms should not be in the
immediate work area of the students so as to minimize interruptions from other unit personnel.
The host unit will provide AV/classroom equipment (TV, VCR, dry erase board, or other
materials) as needed.
6.17. Scheduling. AMCUs will submit an annual affiliation schedule anda current list of
qualified instructors to HQ AMC/A3MM prior to 15 September. For the ARC, inputs will be
routed through the respective NGB/AFRC NAF affiliation manager for validation. The schedule
will reflect the unit being taught, location (including the state/country), inclusive dates, and the
AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009                                                                       81


type of class. Further, the ARC will indicate the pay type (MPA or RPA) instructors will be on
for each class. Units will not teach affiliation classes until tasked by AMC.
   6.17.1. Affiliation managers will schedule affiliated unit training based on type rating and
   training availability requests and make every effort to deconflict training with existing
   AMCU taskings. Affiliated units should be offered as many classes as their Type rating
   affords. Additional class requests will be coordinated with HQ AMC/A3MM.
   6.17.2. Affiliation managers will ensure a forecasted schedule for Phase I and Phase II
   training is sent to affiliates prior to the beginning of the fiscal year. The master schedule and
   affiliated unit listing posted on the AMC/A3MM CoP website will serve as the source
   document for tasking and funding determination.
   6.17.3. Non-Affiliated Unit Training. HQ AMC/A3MM is the approval authority for training
   non-affiliated units. Units that desire training, briefings, or other affiliation activities should
   submit a written request from the unit commander to HQ AMC/A3MM.
6.18. Unit ACLP Management:
   6.18.1. Unit Commander. The commander is responsible for the unit-level ACLP program to
   include selecting and training instructors, ensuring quality instruction, proper guidance and
   emphasis to achieve program objectives.

   (primary AFSC) as the unit affiliation manager. ACLP Managers for AFRC units will be the
   1AXXX Air Reserve Technician.
6.19. Contingency Load Planning Instructor Preparation Course (CLIP). This course
familiarizes personnel with current courseware and helps standardize the curriculum taught in the
field. Active duty units request CLIP training allocations with HQ AMC/A3MM NLT 45 days
prior to Class Start Date (CSD). ARC affiliation managers make CLIP requests through their
respective training channels.
6.20. Instructor Quarters. Comply with paragraph 1.6.2. for general billeting guidance. To
ensure integrity/security of teaching/testing materials, affiliation instructors should be billeted in
the same quarters with students. If the primary instructor is billeted in government quarters,
access to a telephone must be readily available in the room to meet AMC's commitment to
worldwide operations. The primary instructor will submit a written report to their parent unit,
NGB/AFRC NAF (if applicable) and HQ AMC/A3MM explaining any billeting problems.
6.21. Courseware. The USAF EC is responsible for courseware development and maintenance.
The Instructional System Design (ISD) model will be used to evaluate requirements (training
gap) and the desired educational goals for the ACLP program.
   6.21.1. Quality Control. HQ AMC/A3MM, ARC and AMCU affiliation managers will
   maintain a high degree of quality control over the airlift planner, equipment preparation, and
   static load aircraft or ULS training.
   6.21.2. Instructors will teach at least one Airlift Planners Course every 12 months to

7.1. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to define the AMC Airfield Survey Program,
establish responsibilities, and develop the procedures used to request, task, conduct, and
document airfield surveys. This chapter also establishes authority to conduct airfield surveys.
7.2. General. Airlift, tanker, contract carrier, and CRAF aircraft operate at airfields throughout
the world. These airfields must be certified as suitable for specific AMC aircraft operations. HQ
AMC/A3AS will determine the airfield suitability for all AMC aircraft. The suitability
assessment of airfields is based in part on information provided by airfield surveys, when
available. AMCUs in conjunction with functional area experts are responsible for conducting
airfield surveys throughout the world. The form used by survey teams to document airfield
survey data is the AMC Form 174, Airfield Survey (or an electronic form approved by HQ
AMC/A3M). Survey Tool for Employment Planning (STEP) planning tool may be used to
augment AMC Form 174 requirements.
7.3. Responsibilities.
   7.3.1. HQ USTC. Responsible for providing airfield survey request oversight, feasibility
   recommendations, combatant command coordination, prioritization in the event of

     7.5.2. Requestors shall forward airfield survey requests to the combatant command
     responsible for the airfield for validation prior to submission to USTC. The combatant
     command will review and forward valid airfield surveys requests to the USTC DDOC via
     email using the airfield survey worksheet contained in Attachment 3. Upon receipt of the
     airfield survey request worksheet, the applicable USTC DDOC combatant command regional
     branch will review for accuracy and then forward to HQ AMC (A2A, A3A, A3M, A4R A70)
     and TACC XOPM via Logbook Newsgroup for feasibility recommendation. HQ AMC A3A
     will provide a coordinated HQ AMC and 618 TACC feasibility recommendation to the
     applicable USTC Combatant Command Regional Branch. The feasibility recommendation
     will state whether an airfield survey is required and supportable, if not required or
     unsupportable provide alternate courses of action. USTC will notify the combatant
     command if the airfield survey request will be supported or non-supported. USTC will task
     618 TACC/XOPM to execute all supported airfield survey requests.
     7.5.3. If HQ AMC requires an update to an existing survey, or a survey is required for an
     exercise/contingency, 618 TACC/XOP will task an AMCU to conduct the survey. HQ
     AFRC/A3TC or NGB/A3 may task their respective ALCFs to conduct airfield surveys as
     required after coordination with 618 TACC/XOP. CRW survey teams may conduct unit
     funded airfield surveys/updates as required for training and will inform 618 TACC/XOPM
     prior to survey teams departing home station. Training will not be conducted in a combat
     zone.
     7.5.4. The tasked AMCU and functional experts will conduct the survey and publish the
     results on an AMC Form 174, or approved data base, within 5 duty days of the survey
     completion date. If results are needed prior to 5 days, the essential information will be
     provided by e-mail, message, telephone, facsimile, or other most expeditious means. Airfield
     surveys are maintained by 618 TACC/XOP and HQ AMC/A3AS. To recommend immediate
     changes to protected airfield suitability information E-mail; AMC.A3AS@scott.af.mil or
     contact HQ AMC/A3AS at DSN 779-3112 or DSN FAX 576-2019.
     NOTE: HQ AMC/A22 maintains classified surveys. All other US and foreign airfield
     surveys will be maintained by 618 TACC/XOP.
7.6. Accomplishment of Surveys.
     7.6.1. Airfield surveys are valid for 3 years. If no updates are made after 3 years, the
     complete survey should be re-accomplished. Surveys over 3 years old will be maintained for
     archive purposes only. Generally, survey data should be updated every 2 years or whenever
     significant changes have occurred to the airport or the operating environment. Whenever an
     AMCU airfield operations staff determines an airfield survey does not exist or requires
AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009                                                                      89


   updating, 618 TACC/XOPM will be notified. Since airfield surveys can be very costly in
   terms of funding and manpower, comments regarding the importance and immediate need for
   the airfield data should be included. 618 TACC/XOP will task a unit to accomplish the
   survey consistent with mission priorities, funding, and manpower availability.
   7.6.2. For each deployment, the Global Mobility Forces commander, or CRT team chief is
   responsible for updating the airfield survey of their deployed location or certifying that the
   current survey is still accurate. In addition, airfield information must be updated in the G2
   Airfield Database. Minor updates to the AMC Form 174 may be provided by electronic mail,
   message, or letter to HQ AMC/A3AS and 618 TACC/XOP. If major changes have occurred,
   or if the existing AMC Form 174 is inadequate, a new report will be required. Airfield survey
   status will be included in each deployment after action report.
   7.6.3. In cases where team members cannot perform a quality survey due to restrictions
   imposed by local authorities, especially foreign governments, the team members should
   attempt to gather as much information as permitted. The team chief will indicate on the front
   cover of the AMC Form 174 the limitations encountered (e.g., "Limited survey due to host
   nation restricting access to the parking ramp. All parking ramp, taxi way, and runway data
   collected is host nation provided information.")
7.7. Documentation. AMC Form 174. Part I, Airfield Suitability, is designed to provide
specific information on the capability of the airfield to physically handle air mobility aircraft.
Part II of the survey is a checklist designed to provide information to determine if the airfield has
the facilities to support air mobility operations. AMCUs, in conjunction with functional experts,
may be tasked to accomplish parts of, or all of the survey, depending on the proposed operation.
All items in the checklist will be completed and marked "N/A" when appropriate. This
requirement is to ensure survey areas are properly identified and not overlooked during HQ
AMC/A3AS suitability determination. The airfield survey team may use an HQ AMC/A3M
approved electronic version of the airfield survey checklist. Future developments of a computer
assisted airfield survey program will include direct input of the completed surveys into a
centrally located airfield survey data base by means of either a laptop or palmtop computer. The
electronic copy should be sent to the HQ AMC/A3AS, HQ AMC/A7OI and 618 TACC/XOPM
via E-mail. A printed copy together with maps, diagrams and attachments should also be sent to
618 TACC/XOP. Each unit conducting a survey will retain a copy of the survey and keep it on
file (until it is superseded by a newer version) for backup and archive purposes.
   7.7.1. Optional documentation using USAF standard STEP: STEP is intended to provide
   deliberate planning level base capabilities information. Specific on-hand infrastructure and
   potential maximum capacity projections are additionally reviewed. It will provide site survey
   members a hand-held, automated checklist that will allow one time data entry. AST members
   will be given permission to update specific chapters when/if required.
7.8. Quality of Airfield Surveys. The AMC Form 174 must be completed in as much detail as
possible. The survey information provided is critical to determining aircraft suitability and AMC
Contingency Support requirements, and serves as an important tool for mission planners and
AMC functional managers. The following minimum elements should be included:
   7.8.1. Additional attachments such as digital pictures, airfield diagrams, parking plan
   diagrams, taxi routes and hazardous cargo areas, area maps, airfield photographs, city maps,
   road maps, local checklists, phone numbers, policies, and restrictions, etc., are extremely
90                                                            AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009


     useful. Provide template diagrams of MOG and parking configurations. Highlight hazardous
     areas, emergency jettison areas, and warning areas. Include locally produced Standard
     Instrument Departures (SID) and other airfield handouts. Point out key facilities such as the
     fire department, fuels, in-flight kitchen, weather facility, motor pool, billeting, transient alert,
     assigned CRE areas, commonly used marshaling yards, etc.
     7.8.2. Ensure the final summary reflects the MOG capabilities by type of aircraft, special
     cautions and/or restrictions, and additional assessments of capabilities that would help
     mission and AMCU planners determine aircraft and support capabilities and requirements at
     the airfield. The final summary is the team chief's opportunity to put on the commander's hat
     and answer the questions of who, what, where, and how much tanker and air mobility support
     would be needed at the location to run a two shift operation with the worse case MOG listed.
     NOTE: Do not make a suitability determination; only make recommendations as to the
     suitability of the airfield. The recommendation should match the information gathered.
     7.8.3. Report measurements in feet measured to the nearest inch. Convert meters to feet
     using 3.281 ft/meter as the conversion factor.
     7.8.4. Top priorities are runway(s), taxiway(s), and parking apron measurements, weight
     bearing capacity (WBC) and obstacle information. It is imperative that obstacle information
     be specific to include location, height, and distance from runway or taxiway centerline, and
     the edge of the apron. Measure and document each obstacle only once, with reference to the
     nearest approach end of the runway. For each taxiway and apron indicate whether lighting is
     available. Data provided by the location’s Airfield Manager (or equivalent) should be
     verified for accuracy. If not verified, annotate data as such.
7.9. Airfield Survey Database. The AMC Airfield Database resides in GDSS. Access to the
database is through either a GDSS terminal or through a communications terminal. The Airfield
Survey, AMC Form 174, should be used to update the GDSS database. Survey team chiefs
should review the database prior to deploying on the airfield survey. Review of the database may
be accomplished at any GDSS or communications terminal. Notify HQ AMC/A3AS, HQ
AMC/A3MM, and 618 TACC/XOPM of any discrepancies noted in the database.
7.10. Pilot Unit Responsibilities. HQ AMC/A3M is the AMC OPR for the Expeditionary
Airfield Survey Program. However, an AMCU will be assigned as a pilot unit to provide field
level inputs and improvements to the program. All AMCU commanders/flight chiefs and
personnel conducting or compiling airfield surveys are encouraged to submit recommendations
to the pilot unit. The pilot unit will be responsible to improve the quality of the airfield survey
program by soliciting new ideas and evaluating them. The pilot unit should consolidate
suggestions and comments from other units and submit new proposals for implementation to HQ
AMC/A3M. Areas for improvement include content of the survey, written guides for survey
teams, procedures, and training criteria.

                                           Chapter 8

  GLOBAL MOBILITY C2 COMMUNICATIONS/AGE MAINTENANCE PROGRAM

8.1. Purpose. The Global Mobility C2 Communications/Aerospace Ground Equipment
(Comm/AGE) Maintenance program encompasses all personnel and equipment assigned to an
AMCU for the purpose of providing Comm/AGE support for 7E1XX series UTCs. This
includes: line-of–sight and beyond line-of-sight voice/data communications systems and
operators/technicians; automated C2 systems and system administrators; and power
generation/climate control equipment and mechanics/technicians. This chapter provides an
explanation of the relationship between established USAF maintenance practices, AMC
guidance, and the unique Global Mobility Comm/AGE mission; only topics not found in higher
echelon publications shall be addressed. In instances where this chapter conflicts with USAF-
level or higher echelon publications, those publications take precedence. Conflicts between this
chapter and existing higher echelon guidance, regardless of circumstance, should be identified to
HQ AMC/A3M for resolution.
8.2. General. An AMCU is considered a ―mobility-only‖ unit; Comm/AGE equipment and
personnel are assigned solely to support the AMCU’s ability to perform its assigned mobility
mission.
   8.2.1. Organization. While in-garrison, AMCU Comm/AGE maintenance personnel should
   be organized and staffed in the most streamlined manner possible to eliminate parallel levels
   of supervision and management. Instead, personnel utilization should be technician-oriented
   to maximize in-garrison productivity with a focus on deployment readiness.
   8.2.2. Funding. AMCU commanders should ensure that their Comm/AGE maintenance
   program is properly equipped and funded to perform all authorized organizational and
   limited intermediate level repair on assigned Comm/AGE systems, expandable shelters, and
   unit-assigned test equipment.
   8.2.3. Communications Guidance. AMCUs will use AFI 33-150, Maintenance Management
   of Communications-Electronics, as the governing directive for all Communications-
   Electronic (C-E) maintenance activities and consider it primary source documentation for all
   localized C-E maintenance practices and maintenance management policies.
   8.2.4. AGE Guidance. AMCUs will use AFI 21-101, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance
   Management, as the governing directive and primary source documentation for maintenance
   activities involving 7E1XX UTC support equipment such as tactical generators,
   environmental control units, and power distribution panels. In the event AGE maintenance
   management policies conflict with AFI 33-150 or higher echelon guidance, those
   publications shall take precedence unless such a default will pose a danger to personnel or
   assigned equipment. Report such conflicts to HQ AMC/A3 immediately for resolution.
8.3. AMCU-Unique Formal Training. HQ AMC/A3 will ensure that AMCU-unique formal
training programs are available and adequate to provide the skills necessary to operate and
maintain assigned equipment.
92                                                          AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009


     8.3.1. The primary formal training provider for Comm/AGE personnel is the USAF EC. The
     USAF EC maintains a training facility and qualified instructors to train AMCU personnel on
     Comm/AGE equipment in a controlled environment.
     8.3.2. Commercial training. AMCU commanders may wish to leverage commercial training
     opportunities to broaden the expertise of their assigned personnel. Commercial courses are
     considered supplemental training opportunities and do not eliminate the requirement for
     personnel to attend established formal training courses or complete mandatory training
     requirements for the assigned Comm/AGE duty position.
     8.3.3. USAF EC Course Development Process. When requested by the USAF EC, AMCU
     commanders shall make every attempt to provide seasoned Comm/AGE personnel to serve as
     Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) for both initial and revision levels of Instructional Systems
     Development (ISD). The effectiveness of any formal training course can be directly
     attributed to the expertise of the individuals selected to serve as SMEs for the ISD. It is not in
     the best interest of the Global Mobility community to send inexperienced or newly assigned
     personnel to serve as a SME; graduates of the subsequent formal course that spawns from the
     ISD will be less than effective, resulting in additional requirements during the OJT phase of
     an individual’s training.
8.4. Local Modification of Comm/AGE Equipment. AMCUs are not authorized to alter,
modify, adjust, enhance, or in any way change a Comm/AGE system, subsystem, or component
in a manner that results in that equipment’s inability to match appearance or performance
specifications outlined within its corresponding USAF technical order, manufacturer-issued
operating/owner’s manual, or other such publication without written approval from approval
authority. All assigned Comm/AGE equipment shall remain standardized to the maximum extent
possible in order to ensure successful sourcing and tasking of inter-AMCU Comm/AGE assets.
8.5. Mission Readiness Spares Package (MRSP). AMCUs will maintain 50 percent (or one
MRSP if only one 7E1XX UTC assigned) of each type of non-airborne MRSP in-garrison and
ready to meet deployment response times. A 7E1XX non-airborne MRSP is not the property of
the AMCU; it is owned by the host base logistics group/squadron and is loaned to the AMCU for
use during deployments. Until a component is extracted from the MRSP, the AMCU will not
compromise the inventory control seal unless required for shipment/customs inspection. If the
seal is compromised, the AMCU will notify the base supply function as soon as operationally
possible. While an MRSP is on loan to the AMCU, the AMCU will cooperate with base supply
and allow them to maintain control and accountability of each MRSP. The AMCU will honor
base supply requests to conduct scheduled inventories or other inspections as deemed necessary
by the base supply function. When tasked to deploy, the AMCU will contact the base supply
function, notify them the MRSP is in deployment status, and provide an estimated return date
(with subsequent updates to firm the estimate). Upon return from deployment, the AMCU will
follow established base supply directives to restore/replenish the MRSP to pre-deployment
condition without a cost incurred by the base supply function.
8.6. Attendance at Partnership and Standardization Conferences/Workshops. Comm/AGE
maintenance personnel may attend the AMC Global Mobility Conference.
     8.6.1. AMC Global Mobility Conference. This forum affords the opportunity to meet face-
     to-face with AMC Global Mobility Comm/AGE managers and their peers to discuss
AMCI10-202V4 2 DECEMBER 2009                                                              93


   problems, concerns, and other pertinent issues that require the attention of HQ AMC/A3M or
   other HQ AMC directorates.
   8.6.2. AMC-assigned/gained Comm/AGE Partnership Workshop. AMC-assigned AMCU
   Comm/AGE work centers should partner themselves with their AMC-gained counterparts
   and host partnership workshops to discuss Comm/AGE equipment, maintenance practices,
   and exploit Comm/AGE OJT opportunities. The AMC-assigned AMCUs may elect to allow
   their partnered AMCUs to rotate hosting duties, but the AMC-assigned AMCU should
   remain lead unit for planning and organization purposes.
