            SAMPLE EMPLOYEE INFORMATION AND TRAINING PLAN

A3.1. This document provides supervisory personnel with the training requirements for the
Hazard Communication (HAZCOM) program for all personnel assigned to this work area. Upon
completion of this training, personnel must update their AF Form 55 such training.
A3.2. Overview:
   A3.2.1. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issued the Hazard
   Communication Standard, which eventually became Title 29, CFR, 1910.1200, Hazard
   Communication. It states that every individual has the right to know what hazards are faced
   on the job and how to be protected against them. Air Force Instruction 90-821, Hazard
   Communication, outlines the Air Force program.
   A3.2.2. In 1983, OSHA issued the Hazard Communication Standard for manufacturing
   operations to help protect you. In 1987, OSHA revised this standard and expanded it to
   include all workplaces where personnel are exposed to hazardous chemicals.
   A3.2.3. The goal of the Hazard Communication program is to reduce the incidence of
   occupational illness and injury caused by hazardous chemicals in the workplace.
A3.3. Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) are located with the HAZCOM program. All
documents (including the chemical inventory, non-routine task listing, and written plan) are
contained in the HAZCOM binder, located ____________________________________. Work
area personnel are trained on how to read material labels and MSDSs during technical training
and initial work area orientation.
   A3.3.1. A Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) contains nine major sections. The sections
   are divided as follows: Material Identification, Ingredients and Hazards, Physical Data, Fire
   and Explosion Data, Reactivity Data, Health Hazard Data, Spill and Disposal Methods,
   Special Protection Information, and Comments Section. All companies follow this standard
   format.
       A3.3.1.1. Section I contains the material identification and general information, like
       company name, address, material name with synonyms, and an emergency phone
       number.
       A3.3.1.2. Section II lists all hazardous ingredients in the chemical mixture. Many
       chemical materials are mixtures. Not only does this section list the ingredients, but also
       states the percentages of each ingredient found in the total mixture. For example, acetic
       acid may contain two ingredients, water and acetic acid, where water makes up 72% of
       the mixture and 28% is acetic acid. This accounts for 100% of the mixture (72 + 28).
       Knowing percentages is helpful when an air sample is accomplished to determine the
       airborne concentration of the hazard.
       A3.3.1.3. Section III contains physical data. Physical data is characterized by
       appearance, odor, a boiling point, freezing point, vapor pressure, solubility, and specific
       gravity. The important data in this section are vapor pressure, and boiling point. For
       instance, methylene chloride has a boiling point of 39oC (102oF) and has a high vapor

      pressure. Due to the physical properties, employees should be aware that this material
      must be stored in a cool, vented, and flame free environment.
      A3.3.1.4. Section IV provides data on fire and explosion information, such as what type
      of fire extinguishing media to use and whether or not any toxic vapors are released during
      a fire. If so, it states the personal protective measures fire fighters should use. It is
      important that this section be reviewed prior to using the chemical.
      A3.3.1.5. Section V provides reactivity data. This section simply describes ―what can be
      stored with what‖. An example is storing acids with bases. You would not want to store
      sodium hydroxide (lye) in the same cabinet with sulfuric acid (battery acid). If one of
      those containers broke, it would react vigorously, neutralize your chemicals, and produce
      hydrogen gas. It could produce a dangerous situation.
      A3.3.1.6. Section VI contains health hazard information, emergency and first aid
      procedures. The data found in this section describe the route of entry (e.g., skin, eyes,
      respiratory) and the target organs or systems (e.g., liver, lungs, and central nervous
      system) and first aid procedures.
      A3.3.1.7. Section VII provides information on the proper disposal of the material. This
      section tells you how to neutralize a chemical spill, how to dispose of the material, and
      who to contact if a spill occurs. Hazardous chemical wastes (flammable, toxic, etc.)
      cannot be poured down the drain or placed in the regular trash. Lastly, call 61
      CELS/CEV (653-5494 or 653-5491) to coordinate removal and disposal of this waste.
      A3.3.1.8. Section VIII provides important information on specific personal protective
      equipment such as respiratory protection, rubber boots, or eye goggles. It also provides
      information on the necessity for engineering controls such as a ventilation system.
      A3.3.1.9. Section IX is used for any additional comments the manufacturer deems
      necessary for the user. The key is educating the user on the product to prevent injury or
      illness.
A3.4. A listing of all hazardous chemicals is provided as part of the HAZCOM program. The
actual chemicals are stored in ___________________________________________.
   A3.4.1. The HAZCOM program requires the use of warning labels that contain the name and
   identity of the chemical, and appropriate hazard warnings.
   A3.4.2. Labels on containers that leave the work area must contain the name and address of
   the responsible party. The warning label is often your first source of information about
   chemical hazards. The name and identity on the label can be used to find the right MSDS,
   where you will find additional information.
A3.5. Work-center HAZCOM binder MSDSs provide the physical and health risks of each
hazardous chemical along with the signs and symptoms of overexposure and the method of
determining the presence or release of a hazardous material in the work area.
A3.6. Work area personnel reduce or prevent exposure to hazardous chemicals by using
appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and by being familiar with the signs and
symptoms of exposure to the materials they are working with. Three basic methods for
controlling chemical hazards are engineering controls, personal protective equipment, and
administrative controls.
LOSANGELESAFBI48-104 6 NOVEMBER 2012                                                           13


   A3.6.1. Engineering controls include substitution, isolation, general ventilation, and local
   exhaust ventilation. Substitution applies when a chemical, process, or piece of equipment
   with fewer hazards can replace an existing one. Isolation refers to using an enclosure,
   barrier, or a safe distance to separate workers from the exposure hazard. Common examples
   of this are machine enclosures, enclosed control rooms, and splashguards. General
   ventilation is mixing an airborne hazard with fresh air to reduce exposure levels. This only
   applies when hazards have low toxicity and mix readily with air. Some examples of general
   ventilation are fans and vents. Local exhaust ventilation captures an airborne hazard as it is
   released and takes it out of the work area to eliminate the exposure.
   A3.6.2. Prioritizing how we control exposures is accomplished by looking at the source, path
   and receiver. Controlling the receiver is least desirable, but most often used. PPE is the most
   common means of protecting an individual against exposures (physical and health hazards).
   Some examples of PPE include gloves, aprons, eye and face protection, and respirators. To
   protect you, the PPE must be matched to the specific hazard. For example, cloth gloves are
   useless for protection against a corrosive liquid. Personal protective equipment is useless
   unless you wear it. Proper fit, correct use, and routine inspection are essential.
   A3.6.3. Administrative controls include documentation, information, and training in safe
   work practices, good housekeeping, and most of all, monitoring. This applies to personnel
   and equipment. The Hazard Communication Program is an effective administrative control
   to ensure workers are informed on the work area hazards.
A3.7. Steps taken to reduce exposure. Steps are described in the BE survey reports, located in
Tab G of the HAZCOM binder. The reports address PPE and administrative controls to reduce
the risk of exposure to all workers. Additionally, all personnel are provided HAZCOM training
and are always discussing potential situations as well as how to best deal with such situations.
A3.8. Work area personnel do/do not (circle appropriate word) use large quantities of hazardous
materials. Reference Attachment 4 for specific spill procedures.
A3.9. Supervisors may use the following review questions to test workers’ knowledge of the
Hazard Communication Program.
