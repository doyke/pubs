4. Managing the Leave Program:
   4.1. Military Leave Program:
      4.1.1. Statutory Authority. The more common statutes are:
          4.1.1.1. Title 10, U.S.C., section 701, Entitlement and accumulation.
          4.1.1.2. Title 10, U.S.C., section 704, Use of leave; regulations
          4.1.1.3. Title 10, U.S.C., section 705, Rest and recuperative (R&R) leave for
          qualified enlisted members extending duty at designated locations overseas. R&R
          and the overseas tour extension incentive program (OTEIP) are synonymous.
          4.1.1.4. Title 10, U.S.C., section 706, Administration of leave required to be taken.
          4.1.1.5. Title 37, U.S.C., section 411b, Travel and transportation allowances in
          connection with leave between consecutive overseas tours.
          4.1.1.6. Title 37, U.S.C., section 411g, Travel and transportation allowances
          incident to voluntary extensions of overseas tours of duty. This is also referred to as
          the overseas tour extension incentive program (OTEIP).
          4.1.1.7. Title 37, U.S.C., section 501, Payment for unused accrued leave.
      4.1.2. Annual Leave Program. Annual leave programs give members the opportunity to
      take leave within the constraints of operational requirements. Unit commanders establish
6                                          AFI36-3003_LAUGHLINSUP_I 16 MAY 2012


    these programs to encourage the use of leave for the maximum benefit of the member.
    Scheduling leave prevents loss of leave at fiscal year (FY)-end balancing, retirement, or
    separation from active duty. Both management and members share responsibility in
    managing leave balances throughout the FY. Note: Leave is a right; however, unit
    commanders can deny leave due to military necessity or when in the best interests of the
    Air Force.
    4.1.3. Safe Travel Guidelines. Members on leave or on other non-duty status should use
    Operational Risk Management (ORM) principles to assess all hazards and control risks
    prior to excessive or hazardous travel, especially by automobile. Applicable guidelines
    are in AFI 90-901, Operational Risk Management. A comprehensive ORM assessment
    may conclude that fatigue or road conditions are high risks requiring a change to travel
    plans.
    4.1.4. Use of Leave. The use of leave is essential to the morale and motivation of
    members and for maintaining maximum effectiveness. Lengthy respites from the work
    environment tend to have a beneficial effect on an individual‘s psychological and
    physical status. Weekend absences (regular pass) or short periods of leave do not
    normally afford a similar degree of relief. In providing leave, Congress intended for
    members to use their leave as it accrues. Congress provides for payment of accrued leave
    when members are unable to use their leave because of military necessity. However,
    Congress did not intend for members to accrue large leave balances expressly for
    payment of accrued leave. Give members the opportunity to take at least one leave
    period of 14 consecutive days or more every FY and encourage them to use the 30 days
    accrued each FY. Encourage members to use leave, military requirements permitting,
    and consider the desires of the member:
       4.1.4.1. With a permanent change of station (PCS).
       4.1.4.2. After periods of arduous duty and protracted periods of deployment.
       4.1.4.3. When reenlisting.
       4.1.4.4. During the traditional national holiday periods.
       4.1.4.5. To attend to family emergencies or personal situations caused by floods,
       hurricanes, and similar disasters.
       4.1.4.6. For attendance at spiritual events or for other religious observances.
       4.1.4.7. During the period before processing incident to release from active duty.
       4.1.4.8. As terminal leave with retirement or separation from active duty.
       4.1.4.9. In conjunction with the Air Force Educational Leave of Absence Program
       when it would enable a person to complete an education program.
    4.1.5. Unit Commander‘s Responsibilities. Unit commanders:
       4.1.5.1. Establish annual leave programs to give members opportunity to use leave.
       4.1.5.2. Enforce Air Force and command-approved leave guidelines.
       4.1.5.3. Document all leaves and establish an audit trail for money spent in
       conjunction with emergency leave.
AFI36-3003_LAUGHLINSUP_I 16 MAY 2012                                                        7


        4.1.5.4. Make sure members who refuse to take leave understand their obligation to
        comply with unit leave programs and that refusal to take leave may result in the loss
        of earned leave at a later date.
        4.1.5.5. Instruct members to schedule leave within operational requirements.
        4.1.5.6. Encourage members to take one leave of at least 14 continuous days every
        FY and to use leave accrued each FY.
        4.1.5.7. Inform members that there may be instances of leave disapproval or
        cancellation due to military necessity.
        4.1.5.8. Ensure members schedule leave annually at the beginning of the FY and
        update their leave schedule periodically.
        4.1.5.9. Tell members to follow their leave schedule to have an effective unit leave
        program.
        4.1.5.10. Advise members who schedule ―use or lose‖ leave in Aug or Sep that they
        risk losing leave on 1 Oct if military requirements or personal circumstances prevent
        them from taking leave at that particular time.
        4.1.5.11. Seek, if necessary, American Red Cross (ARC) verification when members
        request emergency leave.
        4.1.5.12. Charge leave for leave periods such as those taken by members waiting for
        family members‘ passports or visas or for the outcome of humanitarian reassignment
        requests.
        4.1.5.13. Combine ordinary leave with other types of leave unless specifically
        prohibited and treat the combination of leaves as one leave period.
        4.1.5.14. Make sure members taking ordinary vice terminal leave return 15 days
        before their scheduled separation or retirement to prevent pay problems.
        4.1.5.15. Charge members leave for time spent house hunting in conjunction with a
        permissive reassignment.
        4.1.5.16. Provide an opportunity to use leave to Air Force Reserve and Air National
        Guard members serving man-day tours longer than 30 consecutive days under AFI
        36-2619, Military Personnel Appropriation (MPA) Man-Day Program. AFI 36-2619
        authorizes use of accrued leave. See AFMAN 36-8001, Reserve Personnel
        Participation and Training Procedures, for Reserve Personnel Appropriations (RPA)
        tours over 30 days.
        4.1.5.17. Normally do not grant leave to members undergoing treatment for an
        infectious or contagious disease. Exception: Unit commander may grant leave if the
        attending physician provides written verification that the member does not pose a
        threat to the public health.
        4.1.5.18. Do not grant leave for the purpose of serving sentences in civil confinement
        because civil confinement, including probated sentences thereto, is inconsistent with
        military status. Comment: Members confined by civil authorities while on approved
        leave may continue on leave until the original leave termination date, unless recalled
8                                              AFI36-3003_LAUGHLINSUP_I 16 MAY 2012


           from leave status to duty. If unit commander recalls member to duty, terminate leave
           status as of the recall date and change the member‘s status to ―absent in the hands of
           civil authorities.‖
           4.1.5.19. Ensure guidelines are followed IAW AFI 33-332, Privacy Act Program,
           Chapters 3, 4, 10, and 12, Commander's Policy, and DoD Regulation 5400.7-R, DoD
           Freedom of Information Act Program, for instructions when transmitting, receiving,
           collecting, maintaining, storing, or distributing Privacy Act Information to ensure
           they maintain the protection of privacy rights of individuals, and to minimize the
           opportunity for privacy violations to occur.
       4.1.6. The Military Personnel Section (MPS) must keep prompt and accurate records of
       leave.
    4.2. Leave Approval Authority. While commanders have final approval authority, they may
    delegate approval authority according to the organization‘s needs. They may delegate it
    normally to a level no lower than squadron section commander, deputies, or equivalent (for
    headquarters staff, no lower than assistant functional deputy directors or equivalents). Note:
    During short absences of the unit commander, the commander‘s designated representative
    may approve, in the commander‘s name.
       4.2.1. Annual Leave. At unit level and headquarters‘ staff, commanders delegate
       ordinary leave approval to no lower than the first-line supervisor.
       4.2.2. Advance Leave. Technical school and basic military training commanders may
       delegate to no lower than the first sergeants.
       4.2.3. Emergency Leave. Commanders may delegate to unit first sergeant for enlisted
       members. When delegated approval authority, first sergeants can approve advance or
       excess leave for emergency leave purposes.
       4.2.4. Convalescent Leave:
           4.2.4.1. Unit commanders normally approve convalescent leave based on the written
           recommendation of the military physician most familiar with the member‘s condition.
           4.2.4.2. An Air Force medical treatment facility commander approves convalescent
           leave for members who will be returning to inpatient status.
           4.2.4.3. The commander of an Army or Navy medical facility, or a Director of a
           Veterans‘ Administration hospital, approves convalescent leave for members who
           will be returning to inpatient status.
       4.2.5. Commanders Reporting Directly to the Chief of Staff, Vice Chief of Staff or
       Assistant Vice Chief of Staff. These commanders approve their own leave. They send
       their leave notification via e-mail, message, or fax at least 7 days in advance to HQ
       USAF/CVA. Include in the leave notification:
           4.2.5.1. Effective date of leave.
           4.2.5.2. Duration.
           4.2.5.3. Leave address and telephone number.
           4.2.5.4. Name of acting commander.
AFI36-3003_LAUGHLINSUP_I 16 MAY 2012                                                            9


Note: HQ USAF/CVA advises commanders when extenuating circumstances require
adjustments to scheduled leave.


      4.2.6. Temporary Duty (TDY) Commanders. TDY commanders:
          4.2.6.1. Notify parent organizations via email, message or fax of leave requests.
          4.2.6.2. Approve leaves with which the parent organizations agree.
          4.2.6.3. Send e-mail, messages, or fax memorandums when necessary.
Note: Paragraphs 4.2.6.1. through 4.2.6.3. apply to Personnel Support for Contingency
Operations (PERSCO) Team Chiefs at deployed locations.


          4.2.6.4. Charge leave to members attending Air Education and Training Command
          (AETC) formal schools that close for the Christmas and New Year's Day holidays.
          Do not charge them leave if they perform authorized duty at the TDY site or report
          for approved duty to their home station during holiday periods. When their
          permanent duty station commanders concur, members may return to the home station
          to perform duty. If so, allowances prescribed in Joint Federal Travel Regulations,
          Volume 1 (JFTR), paragraph U4175, may apply. See AFI 65-114, Travel Policy and
          Procedures for Financial Services Offices and Finance Offices-Reserve Component.
   4.3. Leave Disapproval Authority. Leave is a right; however, unit commanders can
   disapprove leave requests due to military necessity or in the best interests of the Air Force.
   4.3.1. Unit commanders may delegate disapproval authority to a level no lower than first-line
   supervisors (for headquarters staff, no lower than assistant functional deputy directors or
   equivalents).   Commanders may adjust delegation of authority based on mission
   requirements.
   4.4. Leave Accrual. Title 10, U.S.C., section 701, governs leave accrual and accumulation.
      4.4.1. Accrual. Members accrue 2.5 days leave for each month of active duty. See
      Figure 1 and Figure 2 below.
      4.4.2. Accumulation. Members who are unable to use leave due to military necessity
      may accumulate a maximum of 60 days by the end of an FY. See for special leave
      accrual (SLA) provisions. Members not eligible for SLA can request recovery of days
      lost on 1 Oct by submitting DD Form 149, Application for Correction of Military Record
      Under the Provisions of Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 1552. See AFI 36-2603, Air Force
      Board for Correction of Military Records.

   4.5. FY-End Leave Balancing. Members may not carry leave in excess of 60 days into the
   next FY. At the end of the FY they lose leave in excess of 60 days unless eligible for SLA.
   The Defense Joint Military Pay System (DJMS) drops accrued leave in excess of 60 days at
   FY-end leave balancing unless automatic carry over of SLA applies. See Section E, Special
   Leave Accrual.
   4.6. Payment for Accrued Leave. Title 37, U.S.C., section 501, is the authority for payment
   for accrued leave upon reenlistment, retirement, separation under honorable conditions, or
   death. It limits payment of accrued leave to 60 days in a military career effective 10 Feb 76.
   A military career includes former service in enlisted or officer status. Cumulative payment
AFI36-3003_LAUGHLINSUP_I 16 MAY 2012                                                          11


   for accrued leave as an enlisted member, officer, or both cannot exceed 60 days. DoD
   7000.14-R, Volume 7A, Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation (Military
   Pay Policy and Procedures Active Duty and Reserve Pay), states when members carry leave
   forward or receive payment for accrued leave when separating with or without immediate
   reentry on active duty. See your financial services office for detailed information on payment
   of accrued leave.
       4.6.1. An additional one-time Special Leave Accrual (SLA) sell back is authorized for
       enlisted Service members. An enlisted member may sell back up to 30 days of SLA,
       provided they have an excess of 120 days of leave. Members may exercise this one-time
       option only when the member would lose accumulated leave in excess of 120 days. Such
       a sell back counts towards the Service member‘s cap of 60 days over a career.
   4.7. Disability Separation.
       4.7.1. DoD Guidelines. DoD processing requirements require members to receive
       payment for up to 60 days accrued leave and afford them time to take any accrued leave
       in excess of this 60-day limit.
       4.7.2. Determining Retirement or Separation Date.          HQ AFPC/DPSD (Physical
       Disability
       Division) determines a member‘s separation date, taking into account:
           4.7.2.1. Leave balance and leave accruing in excess of the 60-day accrued leave
           payment limitation for members authorized payment for up to 60 days of accrued
           leave.
           4.7.2.2. Accrued leave and leave accruing to the date of separation for members
           previously paid for 60 days.
           4.7.2.3. PTDY authorized.
           4.7.2.4. Processing time. Members may take accrued leave instead of processing
           time.
Example: A member previously paid for 40 days of accrued leave and has a leave balance of 70
days. In this case, the member receives payment for 20 days and can take leave for the
remaining 50 days plus leave accruing to date of separation. If member is receiving payment for
accrued leave for the first time, he or she receives payment for 60 days. The member then can
take leave for the remaining 10 days plus leave accruing to date of separation. The established
date of separation remains firm and members forfeit accrued leave if unable to take leave due to
extenuating circumstances (for example, hospitalization or convalescent leave).
Note: Paragraph 4.7.2. does not apply to members separating or retiring because of imminent
death.
       4.7.3. Leave Awaiting Orders. Charge leave as accrued and accruing when the
       commander sends a member home or to another location in a PCS status to await orders
       for disability separation. Charge any remaining time as an authorized absence after the
       member uses all accrued leave.
   4.8. Leave Outside the United States:
 12                                          AFI36-3003_LAUGHLINSUP_I 16 MAY 2012


       4.8.1. Authority to Grant Leave Outside the United States. Unit commanders may
       authorize members to take leave in areas outside the continental United States, Alaska,
       Hawaii, or United States possessions. If leave is in conjunction with PCS or TDY,
       include on the PCS or TDY order:
          4.8.1.1. The area or country of final destination and each country the member will be
          visiting.
          4.8.1.2. A leave address and telephone number through which the unit may contact
          the member.
Note: Members taking leave overseas en route to their overseas assignment must sign a
statement agreeing to the fact they cannot report earlier than their report not later than date
(RNLTD) month. Include in the PCS orders: ―In connection with member‘s leave overseas en
route to the overseas assignment, member has agreed to the fact that reporting to the new
assignment may not be earlier than the RNLTD month.‖


       4.8.2. Ordinary Leave When Not Assigned Overseas. Include on the AF Form 988,
       Leave Request/Authorization:
          4.8.2.1. The area or country of final destination and each country the member will be
          visiting.
          4.8.2.2. A leave address and telephone number through which the unit may contact
          the member.
       4.8.3. Ordinary Leave When Assigned Overseas. Follow overseas host MAJCOM
       procedures for processing and approving leave. Include on the AF Form 988:
          4.8.3.1. The area or country of final destination and each country the member will be
          visiting.
          4.8.3.2. A leave address and telephone number through which the unit may contact
          the member.
       4.8.4. Special Instructions for All Members Taking Leave in Overseas Area:
          4.8.4.1. Instruct members to comply with foreign government procedures as required
          by AFI 24-405, Department of Defense Foreign Clearance Guide, to include the DoD
          Travel Security Advisory. Ensure they also comply with security procedures
          prescribed for visits to communist or communist-controlled countries. The
          passport/visa section in the MPS maintains a copy of the guide and advisory.
          4.8.4.2. When the purpose of the visit is marriage to a foreign national, the
          requirements of existing marriage instructions of the Air Force commander in the area
          where the marriage will take place apply. The approving commander ensures that the
          member can meet these requirements during the leave period.
   4.9. Forms to Document Leave and PTDY:
       4.9.1. Normally use the AF Form 988 for all types of leave and PTDY. AFMAN 65-116,
       Volume 2, Chapter 7, Defense Joint Military Pay System (DJMS) Unit Procedures
       Excluding FSO, contains leave processing procedures using the AF Form 988.
AFI36-3003_LAUGHLINSUP_I 16 MAY 2012                                                          13


         4.9.1.1. Use the AF Form 972, Request and Authorization for Emergency Leave
         Travel, for members authorized funded emergency leave travel. See paragraph 6.5,
         Emergency Leave, of this AFI. AFI 65-114, requires the AF Form 972 to document
         authorized emergency leave travel.
         4.9.1.2. Use DD Form 1610, Request and Authorization for TDY Travel of DoD
         Personnel, for participants or trainees authorized space-required travel with PTDY
         for sports or recreation or talent events. See Table 7., Rules 31 and 32, of this AFI.
         4.9.1.3. Use DD Form 1610 for deferred consecutive overseas tour (COT) leave or
         in-place COT (IPCOT) leave. See paragraph 14.3, Determining Deferred COT
         Allowance, of this AFI.
         4.9.1.4. Use DD Form 1610 for 15-day SR&R leave under the OTEIP.                    See
         paragraph 14.7, SR&R or OTEIP, of this AFI.
     4.9.2. Place the authorization for PTDY for house hunting in conjunction with
     reassignment on the PCS orders when:
         4.9.2.1. Members reassigned with TDY en route or
         4.9.2.2. Members authorized to relocate family members to a designated place when
         going to or returning from an overseas unaccompanied tour. Note: If commander
         approves PTDY, the MPS includes the following statement on the PCS orders:
         ―Member has authorization for (number of days, not to exceed 8) PTDY for the
         purpose of house hunting.‖
     4.9.3. When members take leave en route, authorized PTDY, or both, with PCS or TDY
     travel, the financial services office (FSO) uses the travel voucher to determine authorized
     travel, authorized PTDY, and chargeable leave.
     4.9.4. Local Instructions to AF Form 988. Unit commanders send requests to add local

  4.10. Holidays. Public holidays established by Federal statute are non-working days, military
  operations permitting. When a holiday falls on a Saturday, the non-working day is the
  preceding Friday. When a holiday falls on a Sunday, the non-working day is the following
  Monday. Holidays are chargeable leave days if they occur during an authorized period of
  leave. If departure on a period of leave is on a holiday, the holiday is not a day of leave. If
  return from an authorized period of leave is on a holiday, the holiday is a day of leave.
  Commanders may be as liberal as training, mission, and local conditions permit in
  authorizing leave during the Christmas and New Year‘s Day period.

     4.10.8. Veterans Day, 11 November.
     4.10.9. Thanksgiving Day, the fourth Thursday in November.
     4.10.10. Christmas Day, 25 December.
     4.10.11. Other holidays as directed by proper authority under the law.
  4.11. Miscellaneous Information:
     4.11.1. Leave for Enforcement of Child Support Obligation. Unit commanders approve
     leave requested to attend hearings to determine paternity or to determine an obligation to
     provide child support. Unit commanders may disapprove such leave requests if the
     member is serving in or with a unit deployed in a contingency operation or exigencies of
     the military service require a denial of such request.
     4.11.2. TDY from Leave Status. A member ordered TDY while on leave reverts to duty
     status as of the TDY effective date. Annotate the TDY orders to show whether the
     member is reverting to leave status originally authorized or will be returning to his or her
     duty station upon completing the TDY.
     4.11.3. Recall From Leave. Unit commanders may recall members from leave for
     military necessity or in the best interest of the Air Force. When recalling a member, do
     not charge the period of absence as leave when the period between departure on leave
     and the member‘s receipt of recall is 3 days or less. Consider the remaining time of
     absence as travel time, unless the unit commander determines it is clearly excessive to the
     circumstances. If determined excessive, charge the entire period of absence as leave.
         4.11.3.1. Refer to the JFTR, paragraph U7220, to determine whether travel and
         transportation allowances apply. If so, member reverts to duty status the day travel to
         the permanent or TDY station begins. Annotate travel orders to show the date the
         member reverts to duty status. Use the travel orders to cancel the remaining portion of
         leave.
         4.11.3.2. If the unit commander authorizes the member to resume leave after the
         member completes the duty that resulted in recall, prepare a new AF Form 988. If
         authorized travel, publish orders to return the member to the location where he or she
         received recall notification.
     4.11.4. Absence Over Leave:
         4.11.4.1. See DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, Military Pay Policy and
         Procedures-Active Duty and Reserve Pay, to determine whether an absence was
         unavoidable.
         4.11.4.2. Charge leave for an absence in excess of authorized leave or pass if the unit
         commander later determines to be unavoidable; otherwise, consider it absence
         without leave.
         4.11.4.3. Do not charge leave for an absence in excess of authorized leave caused by
         mental incapacity, detention by civil authorities, and early departure of a mobile unit
AFI36-3003_LAUGHLINSUP_I 16 MAY 2012                                                         15


        due to operational commitments. This applies whether the absence is avoidable or
        excused as unavoidable, regardless of duration.
        4.11.4.4. Charge leave for other unauthorized absences that the unit commander
        determines to have been avoidable.
     4.11.5. Unable to Return from Leave Because of Illness or Injury. When a member is
     unable to return to duty from leave because of illness or injury:
        4.11.5.1. The member must advise the leave approving authority by the quickest
        means.
        4.11.5.2. The next of kin, attending physician, nearest military medical treatment
        facility (MTF), or ARC may act on the member‘s behalf when incapacitated to such a
        degree that notification by the member is not possible.
        4.11.5.3. Upon return from leave, the member presents a statement from the nearest
        MTF or the attending physician regarding the individual‘s medical condition. The
        unit commander evaluates the statement before authenticating the leave document.
        4.11.5.4. The unit commander may consult with the local medical treatment facility
        for clarification or recommendation.
        4.11.5.5. Unit commander issues amended leave authorization, if required.
     4.11.6. Medical, Dental, Hospitalized or Placed on Quarters.
        4.11.6.1. Medical or Dental Care. When a member on leave requires medical or
        dental care, he or she reports to the nearest military medical treatment facility. If
        treated at civilian facilities, governing directives authorize medical or dental
        treatment from civilian sources at government expense only for emergency and
        immediate non-emergency care.
        4.11.6.2. Hospitalized or Placed on Quarters. If a member on leave requires
        hospitalization or quarters status, do not charge leave while hospitalized or on
        quarters. Chargeable leave ends the day before and starts again the day following
        hospitalization or quarters‘ status, regardless of the hour of admission or discharge or
        release from quarters.
        4.11.6.3. If a military health care provider places the member on quarters, the
        member‘s status changes from leave to quarters, and the medical authority directing
        such status notifies the individual‘s commander. The nearest military health care
        provider approves civilian health care provider‘s placement of members on quarters.
        If the member desires to revert to leave status after release from quarters:
            4.11.6.3.1. On return to duty, the member provides the leave approving authority
            with a statement from the attending physician or military treatment facility that
            certifies the period of quarters and date of release. This statement is usually the
            admission and disposition list of the medical treatment facility.
        4.11.6.4. The above provisions apply to a member hospitalized or placed on quarters
        while on emergency leave in CONUS or overseas.                   After termination of
        hospitalization or quarters‘ status, the member contacts the traffic management office
 16                                            AFI36-3003_LAUGHLINSUP_I 16 MAY 2012


           (TMO) at the nearest Air Force installation for assistance with return transportation, if
           required.
       4.11.7. Medical Care at Personal Expense. When a member elects civilian medical care
       at personal expense:
           4.11.7.1. The member takes ordinary leave to cover any period of time lost from
           duty. This includes the period of convalescence, as well as time actually spent as an
           inpatient in a civilian hospital. This applies when an Air Force physician determines
           the medical procedure is elective on the part of the member. Example: Leave for
           cosmetic surgery that the MTF declined to perform or when the member did not
           receive MTF consultation.
           4.11.7.2. Do not charge the period of time lost to duty due to inpatient status as leave
           when an Air Force physician determines a medical procedure is necessary. Following
           the medical procedure, unit commander may grant convalescent leave based upon the
           recommendation of an Air Force physician. For members electing childbirth from
           civilian sources, see paragraph 6.4. regarding convalescent leave.
           4.11.7.3. The member becomes an Air Force patient if he or she experiences
           complications and seeks treatment at an Air Force medical facility. In this instance,
           the unit commander may grant convalescent leave in accordance with usual
           procedures for Air Force patients.
       4.11.8. Civil Confinement. Unit commanders do not authorize leave for the purpose of
       serving sentences to civil confinement because civil confinement, including probated
       sentences thereto, is inconsistent with military status.
Comments: Members confined by civil authorities while on approved leave may continue on
leave until the original leave termination date, unless recalled from leave status to duty. If unit
commander recalls members to duty, commanders terminate leave status as of the recall date and
change the members‘ status to ―absent in the hands of civil authorities.‖


       4.11.9. Absent Without Leave (AWOL). The MPS and HQ AFPC/DPWCM (Missing
       Persons Branch) change members‘ leave status to AWOL when members fail to return to
       duty at the end of their leave period.
       4.11.10. Proceed Time. MPSs administer proceed time in accordance with AFI 36-2102,
       Base-Level Relocation Procedures. The FSO computes leave for authorized absences in
       excess of allowed proceed time.
       4.11.11. Travel Time with En Route Leave. The time allowed for PCS or TDY travel is
       not chargeable leave when members take en route leave. The FSO charges leave for any
       authorized absence in excess of allowable travel time and proceed time, if applicable.
       4.11.12. Permissive Reassignment. Charge leave for travel time, delay en route, and
       time spent for house hunting in conjunction with permissive reassignment.
       4.11.13. Missing Port Call. Aerial port passenger section personnel notify the servicing
       MPS and HQ AFPC/DPWCM within 72 hours after members miss a port call.
AFI36-3003_LAUGHLINSUP_I 16 MAY 2012                                                            17


       4.11.14. Retiree Continued on Active Duty. Retirees who continue on active duty
       without a break in service qualify to carry over their leave balance into the period of
       continued active duty.

Procedure Excluding FSO, describes the responsibilities of the commander, the supervisor leave
approval authority, and the unit. It also contains procedures for the use of AF Form 988 and for
requesting leave. It explains commencement of leave, termination of leave, and failure to return
from leave. It also explains processing leave requests other than ordinary leave.


6. Authorized Leave:
   6.1. Annual Leave. Another name for annual leave is ―ordinary‖ leave. Normally, members
   request leave, as accruing, within mission requirements and other exigencies. Member‘s
   failure to use leave, as accruing, can result in loss of accrued leave at FY-end leave balancing
   or upon retirement or separation from active duty.
       6.1.1. Use of Annual Leave. Members typically use annual leave:
           6.1.1.1. For vacation or short periods of rest from duty.
           6.1.1.2. To attend to parental family needs such as illnesses.
 18                                            AFI36-3003_LAUGHLINSUP_I 16 MAY 2012


           6.1.1.3. With a PCS or after periods of arduous duty and protracted periods of
           deployment from the home station.
           6.1.1.4. During traditional national holiday periods.
           6.1.1.5. To attend to family emergencies or personal situations caused by natural
           disasters such as floods and hurricanes.
           6.1.1.6. For attendance at spiritual events or for other religious observances.
           6.1.1.7. During the pre-processing period incident to release from active duty.
           6.1.1.8. As terminal leave with retirement or separation from active duty.
Note: Members separating under ―for cause‖ provisions and other separatees separating at the
earliest possible date cannot take terminal leave. They either receive payment for unused
accrued leave or forfeit the accrued days if they receive a discharge under other than honorable
conditions.


       6.1.2. Unit Approval Level. Unit commanders are the approval authority for annual
       leave requests and normally delegate approval to a level no lower than the first-line
       supervisor.
           6.1.2.1. For headquarters‘ staff, commanders delegate leave approval to no lower
           than assistant functional deputy directors or equivalent.
           6.1.2.2. Unit commanders can disapprove leave requests for military necessity or in
           the best interest of the Air Force.
       6.1.3. TDY Commanders. TDY commanders:
           6.1.3.1. Notify parent organizations of leave requests.
           6.1.3.2. Approve leaves with which the parent organizations agree.
           6.1.3.3. Send e-mail, messages, or fax memorandums when necessary. Note:
           Paragraphs 6.1.3.1. through 6.1.3.3. apply to PERSCO Team Chiefs at deployed
           locations.
           6.1.3.4. Charge leave to members attending AETC formal schools that close for the
           Christmas and New Year's Day holidays. Do not charge them leave if they perform
           authorized duty at the TDY site or report for approved duty to their home station
           during holiday periods. When their permanent duty station commanders concur,
           members may return to the home station to perform duty. If so, allowances
           prescribed in JFTR, paragraph U4175, may apply. See AFI 65-114.
       6.1.4. Commanders Reporting Directly to the Chief of Staff, Vice Chief of Staff, or
       Assistant Vice Chief of Staff. These commanders approve their own leave. Send leave
       notification by e-mail, message, or fax at least 7 days in advance to HQ USAF/CVA.
       Include in the leave notification:
           6.1.4.1. Effective date of leave.
           6.1.4.2. Duration.
AFI36-3003_LAUGHLINSUP_I 16 MAY 2012                                                          19


        6.1.4.3. Leave address and telephone number.
        6.1.4.4. Name of acting commander. Note: HQ USAF/CVA advises commanders
        when extenuating circumstances require adjustments to scheduled leaves.
     6.1.5. Leave in Conjunction With TDY. Unit commanders:
        6.1.5.1. Determine TDY is clearly essential to the mission.
        6.1.5.2. Make certain members do not take, schedule, plan, or arrange, in fact or
        appearance, TDY to serve leave desires of the member.
        6.1.5.3. Authorize leave when operationally feasible.
        6.1.5.4. Ensure the government incurs no additional cost incident to leave. Note:
        Members may not use non-duty days to extend the TDY or leave period.
     6.1.6. Leave Extensions:
        6.1.6.1. The member must ask, orally or in writing, for the extension sufficiently in
        advance of expiration of leave authorized to permit return to duty at the proper time if
        the approval authority disapproves the extension.
        6.1.6.2. Members who fall ill or need hospitalization while on leave must advise the
        leave-approving authority as soon as possible.
        6.1.6.3. The next of kin, attending physician, nearest MTF, or ARC may act on a
        member's behalf.
     6.1.7. Leave Begins and Ends in the Local Area. The local area is the place where the
     member lives and from which he or she commutes to the duty station. Charge leave for
     duty days and non-duty days (for example, Friday through Monday) when members take
     leave on the day before and the day after non-duty days. This applies to leave taken in
     the local area. Exception: When a member‘s leave ends on a day before a non-duty day,
     the commander may authorize leave on the next duty day for an emergency situation and
     not charge leave for the non-duty days. If the member knew of the emergency situation
     before his or her departure on the original leave, charge the member leave for the
     weekend or other non-duty days.
        6.1.7.1. Normally, leave begins on the effective date reflected on the AF Form 988.
        If the leave start date changes, make the change to the leave status date and leave start
        date on the leave form. The member and leave approval authority initial the changes
        before the member departs on leave.
        6.1.7.2. Normally, leave ends on the effective date reflected on the AF Form 988.
        Change the last day of leave on Part III of the leave form if the leave approval
        authority approves an extension or if the member returns early. Note: Do not charge
        leave if a member is unable to return from leave due to weather conditions such as
        airport closed due to snowstorm. However, require member to provide documents
        justifying authorized absence from the date leave would normally end through date of
        return.
     6.1.8. Leave Overlaps Two FYs. When a member‘s leave period overlaps two FYs, the
     DJMS reduces the member‘s leave account in the FY in which the member takes the
 20                                            AFI36-3003_LAUGHLINSUP_I 16 MAY 2012


        leave. Example: The DJMS charges 5 days to the previous FY and 5 days to the next FY
        when a member takes 10 days leave, 26 Sep - 5 Oct.
        6.1.9. FSO. The FSO computes leave for authorized absences in excess of allowed
        travel time, PTDY, and proceed time, if applicable. Members can ask the FSO to verify
        regular and SLA leave balances to determine ―use or lose‖ leave status. ―Use or lose‖
        leave means leave days members lose if not used before 1 Oct.
        6.1.10. Leave or Duty Status. Determine leave based on the actual date members start
        leave and actual return date from leave according to Table 1 below. Charge leave for
        non-duty days, including holidays, if the non-duty days fall between leave days. This
        applies to members who take leave in, or away from, the local area. Exception:
        Commanders may authorize leave on Monday without charging leave for Saturday and
        Sunday if an emergency situation requires a member to take unplanned leave and the
        member is in the local area. This applies when members take leave on Friday.

Comments: Leave status is not necessarily chargeable leave. For example, a member is on
leave status after working at least 50% of the duty day, and the following day is the first day of
chargeable leave. However, a member cannot sign up for space-available transportation before
the first day and time of leave status.
    6.2. Examples . The following examples use a normal work schedule of Monday through
    Friday, 0730 to 1630. (For members on shift work or alternate work schedules, arrange
    equivalent schedules though the days of the week vary.)
        6.2.1. Example 1. If the member starts leave or signs up for space-available
        transportation on Tuesday:
AFI36-3003_LAUGHLINSUP_I 16 MAY 2012                                                          21


          6.2.1.1. Tuesday is a duty day and Wednesday is the first day of leave when the leave
          approving authority determines that the member performed the majority (over 50%)
          of scheduled duty on Tuesday.
          6.2.1.2. Tuesday is the first day of leave if the leave approval authority determines
          that the member performed less than 50% of scheduled duty on Tuesday.
      6.2.2. Example 2. Saturday is a day of duty and Sunday is the first day of leave, if the
      member, regardless of the hour, starts leave or signs for space-available transportation on
      Saturday.
      6.2.3. Example 3. Sunday is a day of duty and Monday is the first day of leave, if the
      member, regardless of the hour, starts leave or signs up for space-available transportation
      on Sunday.
      6.2.4. Example 4. Friday is a day of duty and Thursday is the last day of leave if the
      leave approving authority determines the member performed the majority (over 50%) of
      scheduled duty on Friday.
      6.2.5. Example 5. If the member returns from leave on Saturday, regardless of the
      hour, Saturday is a day of leave. This also applies if the member returns from leave on
      Sunday or a holiday.
   6.3. Advance Leave. Advance leave is leave granted based on a reasonable expectation that
   a member will accrue leave during the remaining period of active military service.
      6.3.1. Purpose of Advance Leave. The purpose of advance leave is to enable members to
      resolve emergencies or urgent personal situations when they have limited or no accrued
      leave. Members may not depart on leave before the unit commander approves the
      advance leave. Unit commanders may approve requests for members:
          6.3.1.1. Requesting up to 30 days of advance leave and includes leave requests
          which, if approved, result in a negative leave balance of 30 or less days.
          6.3.1.2. Requesting up to 30 days of advance leave in connection with travel, either
          PCS or TDY, including a consecutive overseas tour (COT). This includes leave
          requests which, if approved, result in a negative leave balance of 30 or less days.
          6.3.1.3. Completing technical training and requesting up to 10 days advance leave if
          the first duty station is in CONUS or up to 14 days if outside CONUS.
Note: Unit commanders normally approve the lesser of 30 days or the amount of leave the
member will earn during the remaining period of active military service.


      6.3.2. Delegating Approval. Unit commander can delegate approval to a level no lower
      than squadron section commander, deputies, or equivalents. For emergency leave
      situations, first sergeants can approve advance leave when delegated authority to approve
      emergency leave for enlisted members.
          6.3.2.1. At headquarters‘ staff, commander can delegate approval to no lower than
          assistant functional deputy directors or equivalents.

          6.3.2.2. AETC training commanders delegate approval authority to no lower than
          first sergeants for enlisted members.
      6.3.3. Thirty Days or More of Advance Leave. HQ AFPC/DPSIMC is the approval
      authority. Send requests for advance leave when members have already taken up to 30
      cumulative days of advance leave through the wing commander or FOA/A1 or equivalent
      (colonel or above) to HQ AFPC/DPSIMC, 550 C Street West, Suite 37, Randolph AFB
      TX 78150-4739. Include:
          6.3.3.1. Justification and recommendation for the leave requested.
          6.3.3.2. When the requested leave begins and ends.
          6.3.3.3. The number of advance leave days initially approved, if any.
          6.3.3.4. The member's leave balance at the beginning of the initial advance leave
          approval.
          6.3.3.5. The number of days accruing to the expiration of term of service.
          6.3.3.6. The number of additional advance days requested.
Note: For immediate emergencies or urgent personal situations, HQ AFPC/DPSIMC gives
telephonic approval when members have already taken up to 30 cumulative days of advance
leave. DSN 665-2591 or commercial (210) 565-2591. First Sergeants ensure MPS personnel
complete the AF Form 988 and follow up with a message, e-mail, or fax (DSN 665-2543) within
48 hours, with the information in 6.3.3.1. through 6.3.3.6.


      6.3.4. Wing Commander/FOA/A1. The wing commander or FOA/A1 or equivalent
      submits their recommendation on advance leave requests when members have already
      taken 30 cumulative days of advance leave.
      6.3.5. Personnel Support for Contingency Operations (PERSCO) Team. The PERSCO
      Team Chief requests approval for advance leave in excess of 30 days from HQ
      AFPC/DPSIMC (fax DSN 665-2543) and notifies the unit of assignment of the final
      decision.
      6.3.6. Advance Leave Becomes Excess Leave. When a member has taken all the
      advance leave that he or she will be accruing during the remaining period of active
      service, unit commanders change member‘s leave status from advance to excess leave.
      Members carry forward advance leave to a new period of service if an enlisted member
      separates and immediately reenlists 3 or more months before expiration of the term of
      service.
      6.3.7. Advance Leave Not Authorized. Unit commanders may not approve advance
      leave:
          6.3.7.1. For members pending administrative or punitive actions requiring their
          separation at the earliest possible date.
          6.3.7.2. In conjunction with excess leave authorized for members awaiting punitive,
          administrative, or disability discharge.
AFI36-3003_LAUGHLINSUP_I 16 MAY 2012                                                           23


       6.3.8. Advance Leave and Excess Leave. When authorizing excess leave in conjunction
       with advance leave, advance leave does not accrue during the period of excess leave
       involved. Example: A member with ETS 15 Mar 08 requests 30 days leave effective 1
       Oct 07. The member has 2 days accrued leave through 30 Sep 07. The member would
       normally accrue 14 days during the period 1 Oct 07 - 15 Mar 08. Therefore, the member
       would have a total of 16 days accrued and tentative advance leave through ETS. The
       tentative excess leave period is 14 days (30 days requested leave minus 16 days accrued
       and tentative leave). The member will not accrue 1.5 days during the tentative excess
       leave period. Therefore, reduce the 14 days leave that would normally accrue by 1.5 days
       that will not accrue during the excess leave period (see Figure 3 below). This results in
       advance leave of 12.5 days. In this example, the authorized leave is 2 days accrued leave,
       12.5 days advance leave, and 15.5 days excess leave.
       6.3.9. Indebtedness. The Financial Services Office stops or collects, if applicable, all
       pay and allowances paid after a member's leave status changes from advance to excess
       leave. There is an additional collection for non-accruals of one half-day for every 6 days
       of excess leave (see Figure 3 below). Note: See AFMAN 65-116, Volume 2, Chapter 7.

Figure 3. Non-Accrual Days.

18 1/2-24 days                                       2 days.

Over 31 days                                         Compute in 30-day increments.

   6.4. Convalescent Leave. Convalescent leave is an authorized absence normally for the
   minimal time essential to meet the medical needs for recuperation. It is not chargeable leave.
   The Air Force Surgeon General oversees the convalescent leave program.
       6.4.1. Convalescent Leave Approval.         The unit commander normally approves
       convalescent leave up to 30 days based on the recommendations by either the MTF
       authority or the attending physician most familiar with the member‘s medical condition.
       The commander must not approve more than 30 days initial convalescent leave.
       Extending convalescent leave beyond 30 days requires additional medical review and
       consent. Exception: Convalescent leave due to pregnancy or childbirth. Note: During
       short absences of the unit commander, the commander‘s designated representative may
       approve, in the commander‘s name, convalescent leave.
             6.4.1.1. Absence from duty because of pregnancy and childbirth. During pregnancy,
             members continue to perform normal duties as long as they are medically fit to do so.
             When it is necessary for the member‘s or fetus‘ health and safety, convalescent leave
             is appropriate as long as it is medically required. For childbirth, postpartum
             convalescent leave following normal pregnancy is 42 days to allow time for the
 24                                               AFI36-3003_LAUGHLINSUP_I 16 MAY 2012


             mother to recover physically. Convalescent leave begins the day of discharge from
             the medical treatment facility and continues through the day before the member‘s
             return to duty. Medical authorities determine whether the mother‘s medical condition
             warrants convalescent leave beyond 42 days.

           6.4.3.2. Whether the member can depart the local area while on convalescent leave.
       6.4.4. Convalescent Begins. Convalescent leave begins the day of release from the
       medical treatment facility and continues through the day before the member‘s return to
       duty, if applicable, or return to in-hospital status.
       6.4.5. Voluntary Termination. A member may voluntarily terminate convalescent leave
       earlier with the attending physician approval.
       6.4.6. Requesting Ordinary Leave.        A member may request ordinary leave after
       completing convalescent leave.
       6.4.7. Terminating Convalescent Leave.           The unit commander may terminate
       convalescent leave status if the member‘s continued absence from duty would clearly
       have an adverse impact on the readiness or operational mission of the unit. The unit
       commander must consult the cognizant military health authority to determine whether
       such action is medically advisable prior to terminating convalescent leave.
    6.5. Emergency Leave. Emergency leave is chargeable leave granted for personal or family
    emergencies involving the immediate family. See paragraph 6.5.10 for emergency leave
    requests, paragraph 6.5.11 for travel situations, and paragraph 6.5.12 for travel orders. See
    also AFI 65-103, Temporary Duty Orders, when preparing special orders for emergency
    leave travel. See AFI 36-3020, Family Member Travel, for dependents who may be eligible
    for emergency travel allowances and member is ineligible for emergency leave. Emergency
    travel allowances are under the JFTR, Chapters 5 and 7.
       6.5.1. Immediate Family. Immediate family consists of the member's spouse and
       member‘s or spouse's:

       periods up to 30 days and extensions up to 30 days. If a member has, or will have, a
       negative leave balance, unit commander considers only that leave which is absolutely
       necessary to take care of the emergency situation. Note: The TDY commander or
26                                        AFI36-3003_LAUGHLINSUP_I 16 MAY 2012


     PERSCO Team Chief approves emergency leave after notifying and receiving approval
     from the unit of assignment.
     6.5.3. Delegating Emergency Leave Approval:
        6.5.3.1. Unit commanders can delegate approval for emergency leave for enlisted
        members to a level no lower than the first sergeant. When delegated authority to
        approve emergency leave for enlisted members, first sergeants can approve up to 30
        days advance leave. They also can approve excess leave when the combination of
        accrued, advance, and excess leave is 60 days or less.
        6.5.3.2. At headquarters‘ staff, commanders can delegate approval to no lower than
        assistant functional deputy directors or equivalents.
     6.5.4. HQ AFPC/DPSIMC Approval. HQ AFPC/DPSIMC approves emergency leave:

        balance of over 30 days.
        6.5.4.2. Exceeding 60 days when members have already taken advance or excess
        leaves.
     6.5.5. Unit Commander‘s Responsibilities. Unit commanders:
        6.5.5.1. Approve or deny emergency leave on a case-by-case basis based on their
        knowledge of the circumstances.
        6.5.5.2. Who have reason to doubt the validity of an emergency situation, may
        request assistance from the military Service activity nearest the location of the
        emergency in determining the validity of the emergency situation and the necessity
        for the member‘s presence. When necessary, unit commanders may request
        assistance from the ARC to verify emergency situations.
        6.5.5.3. Approve initial periods of emergency leave for no more than 30 days and

        2543), with full justification if leave requested results in a member:
           6.5.5.5.1. Having a cumulative negative balance of over 30 days.
           6.5.5.5.2. Taking leave for 60 or more days and member has already taken
           advance or excess leave.
        6.5.5.6. Give members the opportunity to apply for ordinary leave, reassignment, or
        separation for hardship reasons if they do not qualify for emergency leave.
        6.5.5.7. Do not deny emergency leave solely because of lack of funds for funded
        travel.
        6.5.5.8. Do not approve emergency leave for purpose of either increasing the
        member‘s travel priority or offsetting personal travel costs.
AFI36-3003_LAUGHLINSUP_I 16 MAY 2012                                                        27


        6.5.5.9. Ensure members contact the TMO or commercial travel office (CTO) for
        travel arrangements because failure to do so can result in non-reimbursement of travel
        costs.

        can approve advance leave when delegated authority to approve emergency leave for
        enlisted members.
        6.5.6.2. HQ AFPC/DPSIMC approves advance leave for more than 30 days when
        members have already taken 30 cumulative days of advance leave.
        6.5.6.3. The PERSCO Team Chief requests approval for advance leave in excess of
        30 days from HQ AFPC via fax (DSN 665-2543) and notifies the unit of assignment
        of the final decision.
     6.5.7. Excess Leave for Emergencies. When members use all advance leave that they
     have not yet earned:
        6.5.7.1. Unit commanders may approve excess leave when the combination of
        ordinary, advance, and excess leave is 60 days or less. First sergeants can approve
        excess leave when delegated authority to approve emergency leave for enlisted
        members.
        6.5.7.2. HQ AFPC/DPSIMC approves excess leave when members have already
        taken more than a total of 60 days cumulative leave (ordinary, advance, excess).
     6.5.8. Emergency Leave Extension:
        6.5.8.1. Members contact the:
            6.5.8.1.1. Organization commander or first sergeant (contact the losing-
            organization commander or first sergeant if on en route leave).

AFI36-3003_LAUGHLINSUP_I 16 MAY 2012                                                        35


         6.7.5.3. Ensure that members remain assigned to their organizations until they
         separate or retire.
         6.7.5.4. Limit requests for excess leave to emergency situations. See paragraph 6.8.
         6.7.5.5. Ensure members complete all required separation or retirement processing
         and have orders in hand before starting leave.
         6.7.5.6. Advise members separating under ―for cause‖ provisions or other separatees
         required to separate at the earliest possible date that the FSO determines payment or
         forfeiture of accrued leave at time of separation. DoD Regulation 7000.14-R,
         Volume 7A, governs payment of accrued leave. Note: Do not authorize terminal
         leave to ―for cause‖ separatees authorized PTDY or excess leave or other separatees
         required to separate at the earliest possible date.
         6.7.5.7. Advise members they cannot use half-days and must schedule terminal leave
         so that it is continuous and ends on the date of separation.
         6.7.5.8. Advise members that they forfeit unused half-days when not authorized
         payment for accrued leave.
     6.7.6. Military Personnel Section (MPS). MPS:

         unused leave.
         6.7.6.3. Ensure members taking ordinary leave instead of terminal leave return 15
         days before their scheduled dates of separation or retirement to prevent pay problems.
  6.8. Excess Leave. Excess leave is leave members normally use for personal or family
  emergency situations when members can not request advance leave. Excess leave is a no-
  pay status; therefore, authority for pay and allowances and leave accrual stops on member‘s
  first day of excess leave.
     6.8.1. Unit Commanders or Designees with General or Special Court-Martial Convening
     Authority:
         6.8.1.1. Approve or deny members‘ requests for excess leave.
         6.8.1.2. If approving excess leave, advise members they must use all accrued leave
         first.

         6.8.2.1. Ordinary leave and then excess leave.

         6.8.2.2. Payment for accrued leave (ask the FSO about accrued leave pay) and excess
         leave.
         6.8.2.3. Some ordinary leave, payment for remaining accrued leave, and excess
         leave.
      6.8.3. Involuntary Excess Leave. With the concurrence of the Show Cause Authority
      concerned, Commanders may place on involuntary excess leave, regular officers
      recommended for discharge (i.e., not recommended for retention on active duty) by a
      Board of Inquiry ―Show Cause Board‖. The officer may be required to begin such leave
      at any time following the officer's receipt of the report of the board of inquiry including
      the board's recommendation for discharge/removal from active duty, and the expiration
      of any period allowed for submission by the officer of a rebuttal to that report. The leave
      may be continued until the date on which action by the Secretary of the Air Force (or
      his/her designee, normally the Secretary of the Air Force Personnel Council) on the
      officer's case is completed or may be terminated at any earlier time.
      6.8.4. Reverting to Pay Status from Appellate Review Leave. For overruled or set-aside
      court-martial sentences, members:
         6.8.4.1. Qualify for pay and allowances for excess leave taken when directed by the
         unit commander.
         6.8.4.2. Do not qualify for pay and allowances for voluntary excess leave taken.
         6.8.4.3. Do not get credit for accrued leave for which they elected payment before
         departing on appellate-review leave.
      6.8.5. Excess Leave Periods. Unit commanders advise members:
         6.8.5.1. Excess leave is leave without pay and allowances, and they do not receive
         disability pay, if injured, for time spent on excess leave.
         6.8.5.2. The FSO stops all pay and allowances effective the first day of excess leave.
         The FSO collects, if applicable, any pay and allowances paid. When members
         separate from active duty, there is an additional collection for non-accrual of leave
         resulting from periods of excess leave. This is one half-day for each six-day period of
         excess leave.
      6.8.6. The following table explains voluntary excess leave requests.

      6.8.7. Requesting Excess Leave. Before requesting excess leave, review paragraph 6.8
      and Table 6 The member submits request through channels to the appropriate
      commander or the appropriate court marital convening authority, as applicable. Include
      the following applicable statements:
40                                           AFI36-3003_LAUGHLINSUP_I 16 MAY 2012


        6.8.7.1. I hereby request excess leave under AFI 36-3003, Table 6., Rule ___.
        6.8.7.2. I understand I may have to use my accrued leave before entering excess
        leave status.
        6.8.7.3. I understand excess leave is a no-pay status; therefore, I will not accrue any
        pay and allowances while on excess leave.
        6.8.7.4. I understand I am eligible for medical care and use of other military facilities
        while I am in an excess leave status.
        6.8.7.5. I understand I will not receive disability pay if injured for time spent on
        excess leave.
        6.8.7.6. I understand the FSO stops all pay and allowances effective the first day of
        excess leave.
        6.8.7.7. I understand the FSO collects, if applicable, any pay and allowances.
        6.8.7.8. I understand there is a collection for non-accrual of leave resulting from
        periods of excess leave upon separation from active duty. This is one half-day for
        each six-day period of excess leave.
        6.8.7.9. I understand that the period of excess leave will not count toward the
        fulfillment of any active duty service commitment.
     6.8.8. Excess Leave to Pursue Activities with Potential Recruiting or Public Affairs
     Benefit to the Department of the Air Force. Officers and enlisted Airmen may request
     excess leave to pursue other career opportunities. Such requests can be made for, but are
     not limited to, pursuing careers in professional sports, music contracts, or other
     professions in which there is a strong expectation of the Air Force receiving a recruiting
     or public affairs benefit. Airmen are expected to use their talent primarily in the United
     States in a manner that generates significant favorable media coverage and likely
     generate interest in service in the United States Air Force. Evaluation of requests will
     consider the needs of the Air Force, the quality of the professional performance to date,
     the strength of the public affairs or recruiting proposal, and potential positive recruiting
     or public affairs benefit to the Air Force. In addition, in making a recommendation or
     decision on an application, reviewing authorities should consider that Airmen in excess
     leave under this provision are in effect ―ambassadors‖ of the Air Force and any
     determination should consider whether an Airman‘s records and service history, to
     include derogatory or disciplinary action, render him or her an inappropriate candidate.
        6.8.8.1. The approval authority for this program is the Assistant Secretary of the Air
        Force, Manpower and Reserve Affairs (SAF/MR). The Airman requesting excess
        leave must make the application by memorandum, endorsed by the wing or
        equivalent commander and sent through AFPC/DPSOS to SAF/MR for approval.
        Any level in the process may disapprove the application if it does not meet the
        defined requirements or if determined not to be in the best interest of the Air Force.
        6.8.8.2. Airmen may apply for excess leave not to exceed one year. Excess leave
        cannot begin until the Airman has served at least 24 months on active duty.
AFI36-3003_LAUGHLINSUP_I 16 MAY 2012                                                           41


          6.8.8.3. While in excess leave status, Airmen may be recalled to active duty so they
          must maintain contact information with the commander responsible for monitoring
          the Airman‘s progress.
          6.8.8.4. The Airman must meet physical fitness requirements and standards.
          6.8.8.5. The Airman must have secured a contract or binding commitment with an
          organization guaranteeing the opportunity to pursue an activity with potential
          recruiting benefits.
          6.8.8.6. Airmen enter into a non-pay status and are not authorized pay and
          allowances while in excess leave status. Airmen who incur a physical disability while
          in excess leave status are not authorized to receive disability retired pay. As a
          condition of approval of this extraordinary excess leave and consistent with past
          practice, Airmen are required to acquire private disability insurance.
          6.8.8.7. Airmen in excess leave status for this purpose must acknowledge that time
          served in excess leave will not be used to satisfy an existing active duty service
          commitment.
   6.9. Environmental and Morale Leave (EML). EML is leave authorized at an overseas
   installation where adverse environmental conditions require special arrangements for leave in
   desirable places at periodic intervals. The EML taken is ordinary leave. Unified
   commanders designate the authorized EML duty locations and destinations.
      6.9.1. Purpose. The purpose of EML is to make use of DoD-owned or -controlled
      aircraft to supplement in-country leave schedules established to carry out basic leave
      programs.
      6.9.2. Funded EML. Funded EML authorizes members DoD-owned or -controlled air
      transportation from EML duty locations for purposes of taking leave in an EML
      destination site. Do not charge leave for member‘s time spent en route to and returning
      from an EML destination site. Charge leave for the period of time at the EML
      destination site. Leave begins the day after the member arrives at the aerial port of
      debarkation that services the destination site. Leave ends the day before the member
      returns to the aerial port of embarkation. See JFTR, paragraph U7207.
      6.9.3. Unfunded EML. Unfunded EML authorizes members space-available air
      transportation from EML duty locations for purposes of taking leave in an EML
      destination site. Charge leave for travel time to and from, and for the period of time at an
      EML destination site when traveling on a space-available basis. The MAJCOM/DPA
      equivalent or designee grants extensions for unfunded EML. Any leave-approving
      authority within the chain of command can deny requests without referring them to a
      higher-level headquarters.
      6.9.4. Required Travel Documents. When traveling outside the United States, ensure
      member checks AFI 24-405, Department of Defense Foreign Clearance Guide, for
      required travel documents. Instruct members to comply with foreign government
      procedures as required by AFI 24-405, to include the DoD Travel Security Advisory.
      The passport/visa section in the MPS maintains a copy of the guide and advisory.

7. Introduction. This section provides information to help unit commanders understand regular
and special pass periods. These are absences authorized, not chargeable as leave, to provide
respite from the working environment or for other reasons. This section contains:
   7.1. Pass Period, paragraph 8.1.
   7.2. Regular Pass, paragraph 8.2.
   7.3. Special Pass, paragraph 8.3.
   7.4. Regular and Special Pass Guidelines, paragraph 8.4.
8. Regular and Special Pass Information.
   8.1. Pass Period. A pass period is an authorized absence from duty for a relatively short
   time.
       8.1.1. It starts from the end of normal working hours on a duty day and ends at the
       beginning of normal working hours the next duty day.
       8.1.2. At the beginning and the end of the pass period, the member is actually in the local
       area. The local area is the place from which they regularly commute to work.
   8.2. Regular Pass.
       8.2.1. A regular pass (liberty) starts after normal working hours on a given day and stops
       at the beginning of normal working hours on the next working day.
       8.2.2. A regular pass normally begins at the end of working hours on Friday afternoon
       until the beginning of normal working hours on the following Monday when non-duty
       days are Saturday and Sunday.
       8.2.3. A regular pass period (non-duty days) for units on non-traditional work schedules
       (alternate or compressed work schedules) may not exceed the 4-day special pass
       limitation. The combination of non-duty days and a public holiday may not exceed the 4-
       day special pass limitation. The combination of 3 non-duty days and a public holiday
       during a compressed work schedule is a regular pass period.
       8.2.4. A DoD Management Headquarters or Headquarters Supporting Activity, as
       defined in DoD Instruction 5100.73, Major DoD Headquarters Activities, determines
       whether Monday or Friday is compensatory time off with a holiday observed on a
       Tuesday or Thursday. An authorized 4-day holiday period consisting of a holiday,
       compensatory time off day, and a weekend is a regular pass period. For the purpose of
       this AFI, major DoD Headquarters Activities refer to the MAJCOMs and equivalents.
   8.3. Special Pass. Unit commanders may award 3- or 4-day special passes for special
   occasions or circumstances, such as reenlistment or for some type of special recognition or
   compensatory time off. They may delegate approval to a level no lower than squadron
   section commander, deputies, or equivalents. Special passes start after normal working hours
   on a given day. They stop at the beginning of normal working hours on either the 4th day for
   a 3-day special pass or the 5th day for a 4-day special pass. A 3-day special pass can be
   Friday through Sunday, Saturday through Monday, or Tuesday through Thursday. A 4-day
   special pass can be Thursday through Sunday or Saturday through Tuesday or Friday through
AFI36-3003_LAUGHLINSUP_I 16 MAY 2012                                                        43


  Monday. This applies to a normal Monday through Friday workweek. See paragraph 8.4.9
  for safe travel guidelines.
  8.4. Regular and Special Pass Guidelines. Unit commanders:
  8.4. (LAUGHLIN) 1 Regular and Special Pass Guidelines. All active duty members,
  Reservists, and Guardsmen attached to Laughlin Air Force Base will comply with the
  following procedures (all civilian team
     8.4.1. Impose no mileage restrictions. However, they may require members to be able to
     return to duty within a reasonable time in the event of an operational mission requirement
     such as a recall, unit alert, or unit emergency. At training bases, commanders can require
     members to be able to return in time to resume training or class attendance. Commanders
     need to base all restrictions on reasonable and legitimate military requirements.
     8.4.1. (LAUGHLIN) Regular and Special Pass Guidelines. All active duty members,
     Reservists, and Guardsmen attached to Laughlin Air Force Base will comply with the
     following procedures (all civilian team members are welcome to participate). Members
     taking leave or going TDY will follow currently established local procedures. Members
     on regular or special pass will observe the following:
         8.4.1.1. (Added-LAUGHLIN) U.S. travel within one hundred seventy-five (175)
         statute miles of Laughlin AFB (in CONUS) -- No Action Required.
         8.4.1.2. (Added-LAUGHLIN) U.S. travel outside one hundred seventy-five (175)
         statute miles of Laughlin AFB (in CONUS) -- All members, under the age of 26, will

         8.4.1.3. (Added-LAUGHLIN) Travel into Mexico – all members, regardless of age,
         will complete AETC FORM 29B. All members will comply with current AETC/CC
         General Order, Mexico Travel Restrictions and current 47 FTW/CC Mexico Travel
         Guidance.
         8.4.1.4. (Added-LAUGHLIN) Every member of Team XL is critical to the Air
         Force mission. All commanders will establish thorough accountability programs, and
         supervisors at all levels will emphasize personal and professional Operational Risk
         Management (ORM).
         8.4.1.5. (Added-LAUGHLIN) The 47 FTW/CC must approve any deviations to this
         endorsement.
     8.4.2. Inform members that the authorized absence that exceeds the pass period is
     chargeable leave if they fail to return from an authorized pass period.
     8.4.3. A special pass may be taken in conjunction with leave without a duty day between
     the special pass and leave period. The member must be physically present in the local
     area when departing and returning from leave. Leave may be taken either prior to or
     following the special pass but not both before and after the special pass.
     8.4.4. Do not grant special passes in succession or in series.
     8.4.5. Ensures the MPS processes an AF Form 988 when members fail to return from
     pass and need unplanned leave.

       Volume 7A.
       8.4.7. Inform members they cannot use regular or special pass periods to extend TDY
       periods.
       8.4.8. Do not grant a special pass in conjunction with non-duty days exceeding the 3-day
       or 4-day special pass limitation.
       8.4.9. Safe Travel Guidelines. Members on non-duty status (regular or special pass)
       should use Operational Risk Management (ORM) principles to assess all hazards and
       control risks prior to excessive or hazardous travel, especially by automobile. Applicable
       guidelines are in AFI 90-901, Operational Risk Management. A comprehensive ORM
       assessment may conclude that fatigue or road conditions are high risks requiring a change
       to travel plans.

Section E—Special Leave Accrual (SLA)

9. Introduction. This section describes the SLA provisions when deployments or assignments
to a hostile-fire or imminent-danger pay area prohibit members from using leave. The SLA also
applies when deployments or assignments to designated operational missions at the national level
prohibit members from using leave. It provides information on restoring leave lost at FY-end
leave balancing. It also provides information on the automatic carry-over by the Defense
Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS). This section contains:
   9.1. Leave in Excess of 60 Days at Fiscal Year-End Balancing, paragraph 10.1
   9.2. SLA Eligibility, paragraph 10.2
   9.3. Restoring Leave Lost on 1 Oct, paragraph 10.3
   9.4. Automatic Carry-over, paragraph 10.4
   9.5. Effective Date of SLA, paragraph 10.5
   9.6. Submitting SLA Requests, paragraph 10.6
   9.7. SLA Approval Authority, paragraph 10.7
   9.8. SLA Disapproval, paragraph 10.8
   9.9. SLA Not Authorized, paragraph 10.9
10. SLA Provisions:
   10.1. Leave in Excess of 60 Days at Fiscal Year-end Balancing. Members lose leave over
   60 days at the end of the FY unless eligible for up to 60 days of SLA. The purpose of SLA is
   to prevent members from losing accrued leave if they are unable to take normal leave due to
   significant and unforeseen operational mission requirements. Members are ineligible for
   special leave accrual consideration if they returned from deployment and had the opportunity
   to use leave but failed to do so. See paragraph 10.9 for other situations rendering members
   ineligible for SLA consideration.
   10.2. SLA Eligibility. Members are eligible for SLA if one of the following circumstances
   prohibited normal leave use:
AFI36-3003_LAUGHLINSUP_I 16 MAY 2012                                                        45


     10.2.1. Deployment to an operational mission at the national level for a continuous
     period of at least 60 days.
     10.2.2. Assignment or deployment for a continuous period of at least 60 days to unit,
     headquarters, and supporting staffs when their involvement supporting a designated
     operational mission at the national level prohibits them from taking leave.
     10.2.3. Deployment for at least 60, but less than 120, consecutive days to a designated
     hostile-fire or imminent-danger pay area.
     10.2.4. Deployment to a hostile-fire or imminent-danger pay area for 120 or more
     consecutive days and receive this special pay for 4 or more consecutive months. Note:
     Examples of qualifying deployments include ENDURING FREEDOM, NOBLE
     EAGLE, or IRAQI FREEDOM. In some instances, the deployment may overlap two
     FYs (for example, deployment 15 Sep - 14 Nov).
  10.3. Restoring Leave Lost on 1 Oct. Members unable to take leave due to qualifying
  deployments may have only that portion of lost leave restored that could possibly have been
  taken before the end of the FY. Example: A member deploys on 15 Sep with a leave
  balance of 82.5 days as of 30 Sep, and loses 22.5 days on 1 Oct. The unit commander can
  only recommend restoring 15 days that the member could have taken beginning 16 Sep. The
  member loses 7.5 days because the member could not have taken 22.5 days to reduce his or
  her leave balance to 60 days by the end of the FY. See paragraph 10.7 for approval
  authority.
  10.4. Automatic Carry-over. The DFAS center may automatically carry forward up to 60
  days. This occurs when members serve for at least 120 consecutive days in a hostile-fire or
  imminent-danger pay area and receive this pay for at least 4 consecutive months. The DFAS
  center uses inputs of a PCS arrival and departure or the start and stop of a hostile-fire or
  imminent-danger pay authorization for a TDY period of more than 120 days. The SLA upon
  departing the area of responsibility (AOR) is the leave balance brought forward into the AOR
  plus leave accrued in the AOR, minus leave used in the AOR. Members cannot carry over
  leave earned after departing the AOR. They lose this leave at FY-end balancing unless used
  before 1 Oct.
  10.5. Effective Date of SLA. SLA carried forward or restored is effective 1 Oct. SLA is lost
  unless used before the end of the third FY after the FY in which service in a hostile-fire or
  imminent-danger pay area ends. For members who served in a duty assignment in support of
  a contingency operation, SLA restored on 1 Oct of the current FY is lost unless used before 1
  Oct of the third year after the FY in which restored. Although members have 3 FYs to use
  SLA, the DFAS center accounts for the use of SLA by using the last leave earned is the
  first leave used. Example: SLA of 15 days on 1 Oct and a member takes 10 days leave 21 -
  30 Nov. In this example, the member has a leave balance of 80 days as of 30 Nov (60 + 15
  days of SLA + 5 days accrued 1 Oct - 30 Nov = 80). In this instance, the DFAS center
  reduces the SLA by 5 days since the member took more leave (10 days) than accrued (5
  days). The leave balance is 80 - 10 days (5 of which are SLA) = 70 days, 10 of which are
  SLA. If the member had taken 5 days of leave, the SLA would still be 15 days.
  10.6. Submitting SLA Requests. Note: SLA provisions do not apply if 3 FYs have passed
  since member lost leave. In these cases, see the note in paragraph 10.9.7. Unit commanders:
 46                                          AFI36-3003_LAUGHLINSUP_I 16 MAY 2012


      10.6.1. Submit requests for members who lose leave on 1 Oct through command
      channels to the wing commander, MAJCOM or FOA Director of Personnel (A1) or
      equivalent. Exception: The joint organizations in which members are serving determine
      the eligibility of members in joint organizations assigned to units, headquarters, and
      supporting staffs.
      10.6.2. Include full justification with all requests, including documentation showing how
      members managed their leave during the year.
      10.6.3. Recommend restoring only that portion of leave that member could possibly have
      taken before the end of the FY.
   10.7. SLA Approval Authority. The wing commander, MAJCOM or FOA/A1 or equivalent
   (colonel or above) approves SLA for their organization. At joint organizations, the senior
   Air Force officer representative on staff approves SLA for members serving in joint
   organizations and assigned to units, headquarters, and supporting staffs.
      10.7.1. Send requests to update restored leave to HQ AFPC/DPSIMC.
      10.7.2. Make the effective date the first of the fiscal year. For instance, member loses
      leave at FY03-end balancing; the effective date of restoration is 1 October 2004.
      10.7.3. Include point of contact (name and grade), organization, office symbol, and DSN
      on each update.
   10.8. SLA Disapproval. Any commander in the chain of command may deny a member‘s
   request for SLA without referring it to a higher-level authority when the member‘s request
   does not meet the criteria for SLA consideration.
   10.9. SLA Not Authorized. Members are ineligible for SLA when the following precludes
   using leave:
      10.9.1. Normal PCS moves and TDYs
      10.9.2. Base closures.
      10.9.3. Hospitalizations, aero-evacuations, quarters, and convalescent leaves.
      10.9.4. Details and special working groups.
      10.9.5. Training exercises, attending schools or courses, and research requirements.
      10.9.6. Pending separations and retirements.
      10.9.7. Workload after return from deployment and members did not take leave before 1
      Oct.
      10.9.8. Post deployment/mobilization respite absence (PDMRA) must not be used as
      justification for authorizing SLA. Note: Members not eligible for SLA can request
      recovery of days lost by application, DD Form 149, Application for Correction of
      Military Records Under the Provisions of Title 10, U.S. Code Section 1552. See AFI 36-
      2603. Member‘s application must clearly establish that an error or injustice by the Air
      Force caused the member‘s lost leave. If the Board restores leave to current leave
      account, members must use these days before the end of the current FY.

Section F—Permissive TDY (PTDY)
AFI36-3003_LAUGHLINSUP_I 16 MAY 2012                                                              47


11. Introduction. This section describes PTDY, an administrative absence under DoD
Instruction 1327.6, Leave and Liberty Procedures, for which funded TDY is not proper. It helps
unit commanders understand the reasons for which they may authorize PTDY. The lack of
official TDY funds is not a reason to grant PTDY except as defined in paragraph 12.3.2. This
section contains:
   11.1. General Information, paragraph 12.1
   11.2. Exception to Policy, paragraph 12.2
   11.3. Commander Responsibilities, paragraph 12.3
   11.4. PTDY Approval, paragraph 12.4
   11.5. PTDY or Duty Status, paragraph 12.5
   11.6. Documenting PTDY, paragraph 12.6
   11.7. Table 7., Authorizing PTDY, paragraph 12.7
   11.8. PTDY Not Authorized, paragraph 12.8
   11.9. Table 8., Instructions for Preparing DD Form 1610, paragraph 12.9
12. PTDY Guidance:
   12.1. General Information. PTDY is an authorized absence limited to reasons in Table 7
   below. Unit commanders may not authorize PTDY in place of leave or special pass nor in
   conjunction with special passes, or for reasons in paragraph 12.8. below.
   12.2. Exception to Policy. Unit commanders may send requests for PTDY reasons not found
   in Table 7 or paragraph 12.8. through command channels to HQ AFPC/DPSIMC, 550 C
   Street West, Suite 37, Randolph, AFB TX 78150-4739. HQ AFPC/DPSIMC reviews, makes
   a recommendation and forwards the request to HQ USAF/A1 for final determination. HQ
   USAF/A1 is the decision authority for all requests involving a general officer. HQ
   USAF/A1P is the decision authority for all others. Include an explanation of the
   circumstances for PTDY and justification for favorable consideration. Submit request
   approximately 30 days prior to the start date to allow sufficient time for processing. The
   wing commander or equivalent submits recommendation and reasons for approval or
   disapproval.
   12.3. Commander Responsibilities. Unit commanders:
       12.3.1. Ensure the reason for PTDY clearly falls within the specific criteria in Table 7
       12.3.2. Do not approve PTDY to conduct official business for which funded TDY is
       appropriate. Exception: When appropriated funds are not available to support TDYs
       associated with officiating retirement ceremonies, (mere attendance is not considered
       participation) PTDY is authorized at commander‘s discretion for up to three days.

14. Unique Leave Provisions.
   14.1. IPCOT. IPCOT refers to members assigned to a consecutive tour at the same overseas
   duty station. Members cannot initiate the travel until they have entered the new IPCOT tour,
   and have until the end of the IPCOT tour to use the travel and transportation allowances,
   otherwise the authority expires. The leave taken is ordinary leave charged based on
   authorized allowable travel. See paragraph 14.4 for exception to the end of tour limitation
   when members unable to use the travel due to duty in connection with a contingency
   operation.
   14.2. Deferred COT. Deferred COT refers to members unable to use the COT leave travel
   and transportation allowances between the two tours because of military necessity, or when
   deferred by the member when relocating within the same geographical/command area.
   Members have until the end of their new tour to use the COT leave travel and transportation
   allowances, otherwise the authority expires. The leave taken is ordinary leave charged based
   on authorized allowable travel time. See paragraph 14.4 for exception to the end of tour
   limitation when members unable to use the travel due to duty in connection with a
   contingency operation.
   14.3. Determining Deferred COT Allowance.
      14.3.1. Review the member‘s PCS orders for deferred COT transportation. The orders
      should contain the authorization to defer the COT transportation allowance and the
      authorization (if applicable) to take leave (non-COT) en route. The losing commander is
      the approval authority to approve the deferred COT allowance and non-COT leave en
AFI36-3003_LAUGHLINSUP_I 16 MAY 2012                                                          67


     route. If there is no authorization to defer the COT authority on the orders, consider the
     COT allowance used. If the orders authorize deferred COT, check with the FSO to
     determine the number leave days taken en route. Effective 1 Dec 98, the non-COT leave
     en route cannot exceed 10 days. If the member took at least 11 days leave en route,
     consider the COT allowance used.
         14.3.1.1. This is not applicable to members who did not traverse the CONUS on
         PCS. Members not traversing the CONUS are authorized to defer their own COT
         leave travel. The deferral is not on the PCS orders. For example, members going
         PCS from Ramstein AB GE to Lakenheath AB UK or from Eielson AFB AK to
         Elmendorf AFB AK.
     14.3.2. If the authorization for the deferred COT transportation is on the orders but the
     FSO determines member took more than 10 days non-COT leave en route, consider the
     COT opportunity used. The member may request reinstatement of the authority by
     submitting a request for a review of circumstances to HQ USAF/A1PA through
     command channels. If the leave en route exceeds the 10-day limitation due to reasons
     beyond the member‘s control, the member may request a review of circumstances. The
     member must submit a written request through the chain of command to HQ
     USAF/A1PA, 201 12th St South Ste 411D, Arlington VA 22202. If the determination is
     made that the member did not use the deferred COT, the member is required to reimburse
     the government for PCS COT leave travel payments made on the PCS voucher.
  14.4. Scheduling Travel. The unit works with the member to schedule the IPCOT or COT
  travel and makes sure the member uses the travel opportunity. Since the IPCOT and COT
  travel is a statutory allowance, members forfeit this opportunity if not used within the
  specified period covered in para 14.4.1 or 14.4.2 below. Use Table 9. to prepare the DD
  Form 1610 for the COT or IPCOT travel.
     14.4.1. Scheduling IPCOT Leave Travel. A member cannot initiate the travel until they
     have entered the new IPCOT tour and has until the end of the IPCOT tour to use the
     travel and transportation allowances. Otherwise the allowance expires.
     14.4.2. Scheduling Deferred COT Leave Travel. When a member arrives at the new
     duty station, PCS orders should show member authorized deferred COT. Members have
     until the end of their new tour to use the COT leave travel and transportation allowances.
     Otherwise the allowance expires.
     14.4.3. Exception to End of Tour Limitation. Members unable to use the authority
     before completing the new tour due to duty in connection with contingency operations
     may defer travel until not more than 1 year after the completion of the duties precluding
     travel. In this case, the member is still authorized to leave travel from the new PDS (i.e.,
     the PDS after departure from the OCONUS location from which deferred travel could not
     be taken) to an authorized location. The cost limitation for travel from this ‗new‘ PDS
     and return is the cost from the PDS from which deferred travel could not be taken to the
     HOR and return. Note: The additional deferment based solely on duty performed in
     connection with a contingency operation is a one-time additional authority and cannot be
     further extended.       If members do not qualify for an extension based on duty in
     connection with a contingency operation, they may submit a DD Form 149, Application
     for Correction of Military Records Under the Provisions of Title 10, U.S. Code Section
 68                                           AFI36-3003_LAUGHLINSUP_I 16 MAY 2012


       1552. See AFI 36-2603. Member‘s application must establish that an error or injustice
       by the Air Force prevented the member from using the authority within the specified time
       frame.
       14.4.4. See Table 9 for using DD Form 1610 for IPCOT or deferred COT leave travel.
       14.4.5. Ensure members contact TMO/CTO for travel arrangements because failure to do
       so can result in non-reimbursement of travel costs. Comments: The JFTR authorizes
       travel and transportation allowances to members in connection with authorized leave
       from, and return to, the overseas duty station. The JFTR, paragraph U7200-A, explains
       the allowances for members and their command-sponsored dependents who travel from
       the overseas duty station to the home of record (HOR) or place of residence and return.
       The government reimburses authorized travel and transportation expenses.
    14.5. COT or IPCOT Designated Places. An authorized destination is the member‘s HOR or
    an alternate authorized place to which travel is no more expensive than to the HOR. If travel
    to the selected alternate place is more expensive than travel to the HOR, the member is
    financially responsible for the additional cost unless travel to the more expensive alternate
    place is authorized/approved by the Secretarial Process. If the member travels to a more
    expensive alternate place (and the Secretarial Process has not authorized/approved travel to
    that destination) city-pair airfares are not authorized to that alternate place.
       14.5.1. Commanders send requests for travel via a designated place or alternate location
       with COT or IPCOT travel through HQ AFPC/DPSIMC to HQ USAF/A1PA, in
       accordance with JFTR, paragraphs U7200-A3d and U7200-A3b.
       14.5.2. HQ USAF/A1PA normally recommends approval on applications forwarded for
       a Secretarial determination on travel to an alternate location in accordance with JFTR,
       paragraph U7200-A3b (Example: members who have an overseas HOR want to visit
       family members in CONUS).

    or Deferred COT Leave Travel.

     14.7. SR&R or OTEIP. Another name for SR&R is OTEIP as described in AFI 36-2110,
     Assignments. OTEIP is non-chargeable leave authorized in lieu of special pay for certain
     enlisted members who voluntarily extend their tour at designated overseas locations under
     the OTEIP Y2 or Y3 option.
         14.7.1. OTEIP Eligibility Requirements. Eligibility requirements are in AFI 36-2110.
         Eligible members agree to extend at a designated overseas location for a period of exactly
         one year.
         14.7.2. OTEIP Leave Options:
            14.7.2.1. Thirty-day non-chargeable leave (Y2). Use AF Form 988 for this option.
            14.7.2.2. Fifteen-day non-chargeable leave and round-trip transportation at
            Government expense for the military member only (Y3). This applies to travel from
            the designated overseas location to the nearest CONUS port and return. Dependents

            are not authorized travel under this incentive. See Table 10 for using DD Form 1610
            for this option. The FSO uses the AF Form 985, Report of Travel Time/Leave, to
            determine chargeable leave based on authorized allowable travel time.
            14.7.2.3. Since the OTEIP leave option is a statutory authority, members forfeit their
            leave options if not used within 12 months after entering the extension.
   14.7.3. Leave Time Frame. Members normally use the 15- or 30-day leave in one
   increment within 6 months after the effective date of extension. See paragraph 14.7.4.3 for
   exception due to military requirements.
         14.7.4. OTEIP Approval. Commanders:
            14.7.4.1. Approve 30-day option (Y2) and 15-day option (Y3) leave requests within
            6 months after the member‘s effective date of extension.
            14.7.4.2. May not approve OTEIP for banking or en route leave with a member‘s
            PCS.
            14.7.4.3. May waive the 6-month requirement if a member is unable to take the
            OTEIP within 6 months after the effective date of extension because of military
            requirements. Set the time frame for member to take OTEIP prior to expiration of
            extension.
            14.7.4.4. Can approve the 30-day option in conjunction with valid TDY and
            emergency leave, but not with ordinary leave, special passes or PTDY.
            14.7.4.5. May approve up to 15 days ordinary leave in conjunction with the 15-day
            option.
            14.7.4.6. Cannot approve 15- or 30-day option in conjunction with reassignment or
            in conjunction with retirement or separation from active duty.
   14.8. The following table contains instructions for preparing the DD Form 1610 for 15 days
   of OTEIP. See the JFTR, paragraph U7300, for transportation in conjunction with this non-
   chargeable leave.

  Operations Handbook for detailed instructions and guidance. If you need additional
  guidance, contact AFRS/RSOAP, at DSN 665-5116 or commercial (210) 565-5116.
     14.10.1. Eligibility. The RAP authorizes all active duty Air Force members (including
     technical training and OTS graduates) up to 12 days of non-chargeable leave to assist
     non-prior service and officer accession recruiters. In support of the We Are All
     Recruiters (WEAR) program, members may apply through the local recruiting squadron
     or HQ AFRS/RSOAP. Technical training and OTS graduates use an application initiated
     by the recruiters or may apply through the local recruiting squadron. All other active
     duty members use the AF Form 988 and recruiting squadron memorandum to verify and
     document RAP participation.
     14.10.2. OTS or Technical School Graduates:

         technical training or OTS base.
         14.10.2.5. Attach the hometown recruiting squadron memorandum verifying RAP
         participation to the travel voucher or AF Form 988 to avoid being charged leave for
         these days.
     14.10.3. OTS Personnel Section or Technical Training School MTM:

         Note: The MPS includes the authorization in the PCS orders if member is PCSing
         with leave en route.
     14.10.5. Hometown AFRS Squadron Commanders:
         14.10.5.1. Prepare memorandum documenting the actual number of days and dates of
         non-chargeable leave and ensure it is sent to the member to use as an attachment to
         the travel voucher or AF Form 988.
         14.10.5.2. Terminate the member's participation and non-chargeable leave status as
         required for non-performance or when continuation is no longer beneficial to the Air
         Force. If this occurs, member is on chargeable leave status following the date of
         termination of RAP participation.
     14.10.6. FSO. The FSO uses the AF Form 985, Report of Travel Time/Leave (JUMPS),
     and the recruiting squadron memorandum verifying RAP participation to account for
     non-chargeable leave for members who took leave en route. For all other members, the
     FSO uses the AF Form 988 and the hometown recruiting squadron memorandum

         revert to leave status to complete the leave provided completion of the leave occurs
         within 3 months after graduation. In such cases, the activity having responsibility for
         the member when TDY or hospitalization occurs approves continuation of graduation
         leave status.

Section H—Post Deployment/Mobilization Respite Absence (PDMRA)

15. Introduction. In support of the Secretary of Defense‘s utilization of the Total Force policy,
the PDMRA is established for members who are required to mobilize or deploy with a frequency
beyond established rotation goals. The yearly rotation goal consists of a deployment-to-dwell
ratio of 1:2 years for active duty personnel and 1:5 years for the Reserve component. That is, for
every one (1) year an active duty service member is deployed, he/she must have two (2) years at
the home station; and for every one (1) year a Reserve component service member is deployed,
he/she must have five (5) years at the home station. This policy applies to all members with
creditable deployments and mobilizations underway on, or commencing after, 19 January 2007.
PDMRA is a type of Administrative Absence.
AFI36-3003_LAUGHLINSUP_I 16 MAY 2012                                                            75


   15.1. Active Component.
       15.1.1. Creditable Deployments/TDYs. For the purpose of accruing PDMRA under this
       program, creditable deployments/TDYs include deployments/TDYs to the land areas of
       Afghanistan or Iraq or with certain theater units (units that routinely conduct operations
       or support units that conduct operations in Iraq but are not based in Iraq). Aircrew
       participating in missions into, out of, within or over the Area of Eligibility in support of
       military operations, count each day of operation as one day of eligibility. Deployment is
       defined as a member on Temporary Duty under Contingency, Exercise, and Deployment
       (CED) orders or other orders indicating Operation ENDURING FREEDOM/Operation
       IRAQI FREEDOM (OEF/OIF) support, Plan Identification Unit Line Number
       (PID/ULN), or similar terms. The orders must state ―in support of OEF/OIF,‖ an
       OEF/OIF PID/ULN, or similar terms. Normally, the "certain theater units" are those in
       Kuwait, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and Manas, Kyrgyzstan supporting units
       performing operations in or airspace over Iraq/Afghanistan.
       15.1.2. Creditable Time. Creditable time is calculated as all creditable deployments
       (time in theater only, travel time to/from not included) accomplished within a ―rolling 36-
       month window‖ starting no earlier than 19 January 2004. For example, if the member
       returned to the home station (dwell) on 20 January 2007, after serving 15 full months in
       the Area of Eligibility, he/she would have ―broken dwell‖ by being deployed beyond 12
       months and would be authorized PDMRA of 3 days.
          15.1.2.1. Creditable time continues to accrue during periods of Rest & Recuperation
          (R&R), in-theater R&R, leave, and for TDYs from the Area of Eligibility to areas
          outside of Afghanistan or Iraq of 30 consecutive days or less.
   15.2. Reserve Component.
       15.2.1. Creditable Mobilizations. For the purpose of accruing PDMRA under this
       program, creditable mobilizations are defined as mobilizations under sections 12301 (A),
       12302, or 12304 of Title 10 of the United States Code. This period includes the effective
       date of the member‘s mobilization order through the date of the expiration of the
       mobilization order. Aircrew participating in missions into, out of, within or over the
       Area of Eligibility in support of military operations, count each day of operation as one
       day of eligibility.
       15.2.2. Creditable Time. Creditable time is calculated as all creditable mobilization
       accomplished within a ―rolling 72-month window‖ starting no earlier than 7 October
       2001.
Note: Air Reserve Component (ARC) personnel who were mobilized on or after 19 January
2007 and have previous voluntary deployment (Title 10 USC Section 12301(d) orders to
Afghanistan or Iraq after 7 October 2001 or 72 months prior to member‘s mobilization,
whichever is most recent, will have that period used as creditable time for award of PDMRA.
Example: In 2003 a member serves in Iraq on Section 12301(d) orders for 6 months, and is then
mobilized for 8 months in 2007. Member would be credited with a total of 14 months of
creditable time earning 2 days of PDMRA. If a member has been previously mobilized, only
that time served on Section 12301(d) orders since the most recent demobilization is counted as
creditable time if PDMRA was earned on the previous mobilization.

   15.3. In recompense for deployment/mobilization, accumulation of PDMRA is as follows:

                    22                    2                              16
                    23                    2                              18
                    24                    4                              22
NOTE:
: If a member is deployed/mobilized in a creditable Area of Eligibility beyond 12 months within
the 36 month ―rolling window‖ (or a 72-month ―rolling window‖ for reserve component
members) then he/she is eligible for PDMRA. The duration of the deployment does not have to
be consecutive, but is instead cumulative.
Example: A member is deployed for 9 months, returns to the place of dwell for 8 months, and is
then deployed again for an additional 5 months, this person would have broken dwell by being
deployed for 14 months in a 22-month window. Keeping in mind that the ratio for an active duty
service member is for every 1 year deployed, he/she must have 2 years outside the Area of
Eligibility (normally, this is the home station, but could include other TDYs which are not within
the Area of Eligibility) the member would be authorized 2 days of PDMRA.
   15.4. Program Administration.
       15.4.1. Commanders must ensure members under their command properly accrue and
       receive credit for PDMRA under the guidelines above.
           15.4.1.1. Reserve component members who are federal, state, or local government
           civilian employees, and are ―precluded by law‖ from being paid by federal, state or
           local governments simultaneously serving in a reserve component status and in their
           civilian jobs may elect to receive Assignment Incentive Pay (AIP) (37 U.S.C., Section
           307a) in lieu of being awarded administrative absence days. Federal employees must
           be advised that they are prohibited from working at their civilian government
           positions while on PDMRA. Prior to deployment, a member opting AIP must sign a
           written AIP agreement for payment. For this purpose, the AIP is valued at a rate of
           $200 for each day of administrative absence authorized/earned under the PDMRA
           program, not to exceed the $3000 monthly maximum payable to an individual
           member under 37 U.S.C. Section 307a. A member qualifying for AIP under more
AFI36-3003_LAUGHLINSUP_I 16 MAY 2012                                                          77


          than one incentive program may receive concurrent AIP payments, not to exceed
          more than $3000 monthly in total AIP payments.
       15.4.2. Active and reserve component members must use PDMRA within 12 months of
       return from deployment or it is forfeited. PDMRA must be used prior to or in
       conjunction with the next PCS/PCA. PDMRA must not be used as justification for
       authorizing special leave accrual.
       15.4.3. PDMRA is not a form of leave or special pass, but is an administrative absence.
       Under PDMRA, a member is authorized to depart the local area. PDMRA can be used in
       conjunction with leave. However, PDMRA cannot be combined with passes and post-
       deployment down-time for the purpose of extending the time away from the local area.
       PDMRA must be documented on an AF Form 988, Leave Request/Authorization, with
       Block 8 being annotated as PTDY and the reason annotated as ―PDMRA‖.
       15.4.4. In the event that a court-martial action has been initiated against a deployed
       Airman, their PDMRA accrual-time is suspended, beginning with the day that charges are
       preferred, or, adverse administrative action is initiated, pending final resolution of the
       matter. Commanders must document suspension date of creditable time pending a final
       resolution of the charges. If the Airman is cleared of the charges, the Airman‘s PDMRA
       will be reinstated and recomputed based on established guidance.
