                                        INTRODUCTION

1.1. Overview. Depot Maintenance activation planning requirements are defined through
systems engineering process and, in particular, through the life cycle sustainment planning
process. The following paragraphs are an overview of the main elements of planning
requirements.
     1.1.1. It is Department of Defense (DoD) policy (DoD Directive 4151.18, Maintenance of
     Military Materiel) to provide organic maintenance for inherently Governmental and core
     capability requirements in accordance with Title 10 United States Code (USC) §2464, Core
     Logistics Capabilities. This publication provides guidance in depot activation and
     establishing the organic capability at the ALCs.
     1.1.2. Sustainment planning begins early in the acquisition process, pre-Milestone (MS) A.
     It can also begin any time major changes occur due to: (1) a 20 percent or more increase in
     labor hours, cost or quantities; (2) major deficiencies or safety mishaps; (3) modifications;
     (4) Material Improvement Projects; (5) approval of major cost savings efforts from accepted
     suggestions; (6) other major changes not described here. Any of these major changes may
     generate a new Depot Source of Repair (DSOR) decision.
     1.1.3. HQ AFMC/A8/9 manages the AFMC Mission Assignment (MA) process, which
     assigns acquisition and sustainment management responsibilities for weapon systems and
     programs to the appropriate Center.
     1.1.4. DSOR. All Air Force depot level maintenance posturing decisions are made through
     the DSOR process (reference AFI 63-101, Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle
     Management) (hardware and software). AFI 63-101 defines how a product support strategy
     integrates acquisition and sustainment throughout the weapon system‘s life cycle, and
     requires the Program Manager (PM) to consider core and partnered workloads in their DSOR
     development. Once the DSOR has been completed, Depot Maintenance Activation Working
     Group (DMAWG) activities begin in earnest.
     1.1.5. Unless otherwise specified, for the purpose of this document the term PM will be
     considered synonymous with System Program Manager (SPM) or Product Group Manager
     (PGM), as applicable to a program. Furthermore, the PM may assign specific responsibilities
     to the Product Support Manager (PSM). Normally, the PSM will be the individual tasked
     with the majority of depot maintenance activation planning activities. The PM/PSM may
     also receive assistance from the Product Support Integrator (PSI). See AFI 63-101 for a
     description of specific duties.
     1.1.6. Funding. Funding for depot activation includes requirements for facilities, equipment,
     training, data, TDY, and other directly related expenses to ensure the required sustainment
     capability is developed. The PM is responsible for including all depot activation costs in the
     program life cycle cost estimates that are provided to the MAJCOM for funding before MS
     B, or MS C if there is no MS B. Refer to DoD Financial Management Regulation 7000.14-
     R for further guidance.
AFMCI21-101 14 JUNE 2012                                                                             5


1.2. DMAWG Initiation. The DMAWG is formally initiated after DSOR completion and shall
continue until all required workloads are activated. DMAWG meetings, which should occur at
least quarterly, can take place virtually if warranted to conserve funds or interim virtual meetings
may be needed to meet more frequent needs. Specific members may also be chosen to attend
virtually if a particular meeting does not warrant their physical presence. The DSOR team will
provide a foundation of information for the DMAWGs. If the organic DSOR is another Service,
the selected depot will provide the same support to the PO for sustainment planning and
implementation. The PM or PSM (civilian or military personnel) will chair or co-chair the
DMAWG with the PSI and oversee the Maintenance Activation Planning Team(s) (MAPT). The
selected depot will provide support to the DMAWG and MAPTs, as required, to ensure the
timely stand up of capability (hardware and software). The Acquisition Sustainment (AS) Tool
Kit is a source of information for depot maintenance planning (reference AFI 63-101). The AS
Tool Kit lays out DMAP tasks by phase and can provide assistance with DMAWG initiation.
   1.2.1. The DMAWG will have, as a minimum, the following voting members: The PM or
   PSM as chair or co-chair with the PSI; MAPT lead assigned by each selected depot that has
   an assigned workload; AFGLSC representative; and the owning Major Command. Non-
   voting members will consist of: The contractor and HQ AFMC/A4. For Joint programs, the
   DMAWG will include the other Services‘ depot and Maintenance Interservice Support
   Management Office.
   1.2.2. The PSM is the individual with functional responsibility for the sustainment portion of
   a system‘s life cycle in support of a PM. The PSM acts as sustainment champion to ensure
   that sustainment issues are addressed early in the acquisition process. See AFI63-101 for a
   description of specific duties.
   1.2.3. The PM, with support of the PSM and PSI, ensures that organic capability exists no
   later than four years after achieving Initial Operational Capability (IOC) or is fielded in
   support of operations, hereafter known as IOC+4, as required by 10 USC 2464. The
   PM/PSM should target IOC as a ―stretch‖ goal to establish organic capability to limit or
   eliminate the costs associated with Interim Contractor Support (ICS).
   1.2.4. The DMAWG will have a MAPT at each Depot and each MAPT may have multiple
   Integrated Process Teams (IPTs). The DMAWG will be responsible for the depot activation
   of the system assigned. The MAPT will provide the DMAWG with a schedule and regular
   updates on the progress of the workload and impact to the Integrated Master Schedule (IMS).
   The DMAWG is responsible to ensure that the schedule is maintained and that the PM,
   selected depot and HQ AFMC/A4 are aware of all developments. See Figure 1.1
   1.2.5. One of the main products of the DMAWG is the DMAP. The DMAP depicts the
   events, resources, and schedules required to achieve an organic depot maintenance capability.
   The DMAWG will develop a DMAP for each depot activation. The DMAWG will include
   participating Service's requirements in the DMAP for joint service programs. The DMAWG
   provides the baseline or updated implementation plan and DMAP, and the status of the
   DMAP activities to HQ AFMC/A4. The initial implementation plan called for in the HQ
   AFMC/A4 DSOR notification letter will be prepared and delivered by the prescribed due
   date. The plan will include, at minimum: Support Equipment (SE) delivery, test software,
   technical data, facilities, training, first article produced, and depot activation data as reflected
   by sample at Attachment 4. The DMAWG updates the initial plan, as required.

 DEPOT MAINTENANCE ACTIVATION PLANNING AND CONTRACT STRATEGY

2.1. Development. The PM/PSM and PSI will formulate the DMAP and contract strategy to
achieve depot maintenance. Preparation for depot maintenance activation planning and
implementation will include the following: (1) The LCMP shall briefly describe the
maintenance plan and the DMAP. The LCMP will detail the contractor's ILS planning,
government activities, and the schedule by which these activities are to be completed (AFI 63-
101); and (2) Use the EMD Request for Proposal (RFP) as source documentation, which will:
(1) Provide the details and timing of information required in support of depot maintenance
activation planning, including methods to preclude use of ICS. Key information shall include,
but not be limited to, demand rates, mean time to repair and mean time between failure for
DLRs, and all available technical data for DLRs; and (2) Require that contractor's detailed
approach to maintenance planning and the DMAP be described in the contractor's LCMP.
   2.1.1. Depot activation planning will include: (1) An iterative Supportability Analysis to
   include, but not limited to, Level of Repair Analysis (LORA), and Maintenance Task
   Analysis at the time of the Preliminary Design Review (PDR). These decisions will be
   reassessed at the Critical Design Review (CDR); and (2) The definition of support subsystem
   design requirements shall be concurrent with weapon hardware development.
2.2. Formal Planning. Formal depot maintenance activation planning will begin as soon as
possible following DSOR completion.
   2.2.1. The formal establishment of the DMAWG will occur not later than MS B, or at
   program initiation if post MS B. The DMAWG will be made up of core representatives from
   the ALC(s), the Product Center, and PO. Other participants may be included (e.g., HQ
   AFMC/A4, contractor(s), AFMETCAL). If more than one ALC/AFMETCAL representative
   is appointed to the DMAWG, one will be designated as the spokesperson for that installation.
   For Joint programs, the Air Force PM should ensure the Army, Marine Corps, and Navy
   representatives are members of the DMAWG. Upon request, the PM/PSM will provide
   status to HQ AFMC/A4.
   2.2.2. An initial DMAP will be published no later than 30 days after the PDR LORA is
   complete.
2.3. Modifications to DMAP. The DMAPs will be updated annually or as significant
engineering and funding changes occur. Participating activities shall report all status changes of
the DMAP implementation to the DMAWG chair/co-chair and HQ AFMC/A4.

          3.3.6.1.1. Inputs should include a depot level repair analysis (DLRA) which
          identifies, at minimum, failure data (mean time between failure, mean time to repair,
          etc.), facility/space requirements, testing parameters (if any), required support
          equipment, and estimated number of personnel needed for all depot level reparable
          items.
             3.3.6.1.1.1. The DLRA will establish the baseline needs for the MAPTs to
             compare with current, existing capabilities. A gap analysis will be performed to
             identify the investments required (after due diligence to ensure efficiency by
             utilizing existing capabilities) and presented to the DMAWG. Judicious use of
             ―site surveys‖ can be employed to ensure a proper gap analysis is performed.
          3.3.6.1.2. DMAWG addresses logistics support considerations in the implementation
          plans. This includes maximum usage of existing/projected capabilities and excess
          capacity to remain good stewards of tax payer dollars.

Terms
50/50—Refers to Title 10 USC §2466 that states no more than 50% of depot maintenance dollars
may be spent for contract repair.
Acquisition Life Cycle—The life of an acquisition program consists of phases, each preceded
by a milestone or other decision point, during which a system goes through Research,
Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E), and production. Currently, the five phases are:
Material Solution Analysis (MSA); Technology Development; Engineering and Manufacturing
Development (EMD); Production and Deployment; and Operations and Support.
Core—Refers to Title 10 USC §2464 that says DoD must maintain a core logistics capability
that is Government-owned and Government-operated (including Government personnel and
Government-owned and Government-operated equipment and facilities) to ensure national
defense contingency situations.
Depot Level Maintenance—The level of maintenance consisting of those on- and off-
equipment maintenance tasks performed using the highly specialized skills, sophisticated shop
equipment, or special activities of a supporting command at a logistics center, centralized repair
facility, contractor repair facility, or, in some cases, at an operating location. Maintenance
performed at a depot may also include organizational and intermediate level tasks as negotiated
between operating and supporting commands.
Depot Maintenance Activation Plan (DMAP)—A plan, developed by the PM, showing the
events and schedules required to achieve a depot maintenance capability for specified systems,
equipment, and resources. This plan will consider contractor support requirements, as well as
organic and interservice requirements.
Depot Maintenance Activation Working Group (DMAWG)—A group of representatives
from the activities involved in activating a depot maintenance capability for individual systems
and equipment.
Depot Maintenance Interservicing (DMI)—An interservice process to select site specific
depots to perform maintenance support. Reviews are done by a joint service forum to ensure
consideration of all services' depot capabilities.
Depot Maintenance Source of Repair (DSOR)—The DSOR process is used to decide whether
organic or contractual depot resources should be used to support depot maintenance
requirements. To permit on-time depot activation planning and reduce dependence on ICS, this
decision process should normally occur no later than the Technology Development phase of an
acquisition program.
AFMCI21-101 14 JUNE 2012                                                                           27


Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase—The third phase of the life
cycle as defined and established by DoDI 5000.02. This phase consists of two efforts, Integrated
System Design and System Capability & Manufacturing Process Demonstration, and begins after
MS B.
Facility Requirement Plan (FRP)—The FRP provides the information that drives the entire
facility acquisition program. The facility requirement plan is prepared by the system contractor
through application of DI-S-6173, Facility Requirement Plan, called out in the statement of work
and Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL). The plan can provide information on all facilities
required to support a new system program throughout the life cycle of system development,
acquisition and operation, such as: operational, depot and training facilities, or may be tailored to
provide information on those facilities of interest during a single phase of the program. While at
this stage of the program, the information contained in the document is preliminary; it will
provide a means to justify or update previous facility and cost estimates.
First Article Test (FAT)—A procedure to test and evaluate a new or modified product for
conformance with specified contract requirements before or in the initial stage of production
under a contract. It also validates and verifies the repair facility's capability to correctly perform
checkout procedures and identify faults.
IOC+4—Refers to Title 10 USC §2464 that requires establishment of organic repair capability
for weapon systems or items of military equipment identified as core exist no later than four
years after achieving Initial Operational Capability or fielded in support of operations.
Interim Contract Support (ICS)—A preplanned, temporary support alternative for the initial
period of operational use of new Air Force weapons systems, equipment, or modifications for
which eventual organic support is planned.
Maintenance Activation Planning Team (MAPT)—Team(s) established using the philosophy
of the Integrated Product Development. MAPT(s) support DMAWG in activating organic
depot(s) for new workloads.
Maintenance Concept—A description of maintenance considerations and constraints submitted
as part of the acquisition process. It is initially developed by operating commands and refined
from MS A through MS C by the implementing command, with the supporting and operating
commands. It is introduced for design consideration, refinement, and revision in the CR phase of
each new system, equipment, or modification. The maintenance concept defines where
(organizational or depot) tasks will be performed.
Maintenance Plan—A plan that evolves from the maintenance concept. It prescribes
maintenance actions, including intervals; repair levels and locations; personnel numbers and
skills; technical data; tools; equipment; facilities; and spares and repair parts for each significant
item of a system or equipment. During the Technology Development phase, the operating,
implementing, and supporting commands initiate the development of the maintenance plan. The
ALC/ AFMETCAL pre-production planning and Prototype/First Article efforts must be
adequately addressed in setting the depot activation date for the organic capability. Information
for the plan should be extracted from the Logistics Management Information data.
Materiel Solution Analysis Phase—The purpose of this phase is to assess potential materiel
solutions and to satisfy the phase-specific entry criteria for the next program milestone
designated by the MDA. This phase begins with the Materiel Development Decision. Entrance
 28                                                              AFMCI21-101 14 JUNE 2012


into this phase depends upon an approved ICD resulting from the analysis of current mission
performance and an analysis of potential concepts. Activities during this phase are in preparation
for a MS-A decision.
Product Center—A center that is responsible for RDT&E, and initial acquisition of technology,
systems and related equipment for the Air Force.
Product Support Integrator—Entity within the Federal Government or outside the Federal
Government charged with integrating all sources of product support, both private and public,
defined within the scope of a product support agreement.
Product Support Manager—The individual with responsibility to lead the development,
implementation, and top-level integration and management of all sources of support to meet
Warfighter sustainment and readiness requirements.
Production and Deployment Phase—The Production and Deployment starts after approval of
MS-C. The purpose of the Production and Deployment phase is to demonstrate operational
effectiveness and suitability and to achieve an operational capability. During this phase several
key decisions and activities will take place in preparation for the Full Rate Production (FRP)
decision and subsequent entry into the Operations and Support Phase.
Prototype—The first full-scale functional form of a new system, subsystem, or component, on
which the design of subsequent production items is patterned.
System Program Manager (SPM) or Program Manager (PM)—The individual directing an
AFMC Program Office (PO) who is ultimately responsible and accountable for decisions and
resources in overall program execution of a military system.
Technology Development Phase—The second phase of the Defense Acquisition Management
Framework as defined and established by DoDI 5000.02. It is initiated by a successful MS A
decision. The purpose of this phase is to reduce technology risk and to determine the appropriate
set of technologies to be integrated into the full system. This effort is normally funded only for
advanced development work and does not mean that a new acquisition program has been
initiated. See Program Initiation.

  SAMPLE DEPOT MAINTENANCE ACTIVATION WORKING GROUP (DMAWG)
                           CHARTER

                                  (Insert System Name)
            Depot Maintenance Activation Working Group (DMAWG) Charter
                        Initial Charter: (Insert Day Month Year)
A2.1. Purpose: The purpose of this charter is to establish a DMAWG that will ensure an
organic depot maintenance capability is established in accordance with public law, in a timely
and efficient manner. In order to establish government-controlled capabilities for the depot
repair of equipment, it is essential to conduct depot maintenance activation planning early in the
process. This activity is required to ensure funding, contracting, and delivery of data are
accomplished in a timely manner. This data will be used by agencies making maintenance
decisions on Depot Maintenance Activation Plan (DMAP) efforts. Depot maintenance activation
planning must be an orderly and disciplined process for all (Insert I.D. System) or sub-systems
requiring depot maintenance resources. The (Insert I.D. System) Life Cycle Management Plan
(LCMP/(Insert PSMP-SAMP if system is post IOC) and other governance, such as decision
documents from the Depot Source of Repair (DSOR) process, Acquisition Strategy Panel (ASP)
decisions, and Air Force and Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) direction, will provide
detailed guidance about how, when, and where each repairable item will be repaired.
A2.2. Authorization: In order to establish depot maintenance planning, the (Insert I.D. System)
Program Manager (PM/PSM) is required to establish a DMAWG. The (Insert I.D. PM/PSM's
and PSI’s Squadron) under the authority of the (Insert I.D. PM/PSM's and PSI’s Group)/CC
will organize and chair the (Insert I.D. System) DMAWG. The DMAWG is responsible for the
systematic and orderly development of an organic depot maintenance capability.
A2.3. Vision: The intent of this charter is to stand up the (Insert I.D. System) DMAWG with
the overarching goal to achieve organic depot support for the (Insert I.D. System), in accordance
with public law (Title 10 USC §2464), utilizing the support strategies approved in the LCMP.
The critical timeline determined to best meet the war fighter‘s need has been established as no
later than (Insert Day, Month, Year), four years from the (Insert I.D. System) Initial Operational
Capability (IOC) declaration date of (Insert Day, Month, Year). Organic depots will be the
Source of Repair (SOR) for all workload identified as core or the directed source. Non-core
depot work will be performed by the SOR that provides the best value to the (Insert I.D. System)
Program or the directed source. Organic depot activations will be managed by the DMAWG in
accordance with the DMAP.

                         Depot Maintenance Activation Plan (DMAP)
A4.1. Executive Summary. The (Insert name of System) Depot Maintenance Activation Plan
(DMAP) is a consolidated top-level plan that incorporates an IMS designed to systematically
prepare and introduce all depot level maintenance workload into the designated Air Logistics
Centers (ALCs) or other designated facilities. The activation effort includes standing up system
and DLR capability and related software maintenance and integration/test facilities. The DMAP
is a living document and will be updated as needed, presented, and approved at each Depot
Maintenance Activation Working Group (DMAWG) meeting and will be based on funding
targets as provided by the Program Manager (PM). The DMAWG chair/co-chairs are the
approving authorities.
   A4.1.1. Parties involved in the formulation or review of the DMAP and IMS may include
   the PM/PSM, PSI, and functional team, the ALC Maintenance Wings (MXW), the prime
   contractor, joint service and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). Detailed activation plans
   and schedules, which track activation events down to the DLR and associated requirements
   to ensure DLR capability at each designated Source of Repair (SOR).
   A4.1.2. Add brief description of updated information each time the DMAP is updated.
A4.2. Purpose. The purpose of this plan is to establish organic depot maintenance capability at
designated SOR in a timely and efficient manner in accordance with public law. Advance
planning and preparation identifies funding requirements, delivery of data, and resource
(facilities, personnel, & equipment) acquisitions are complete prior to the introduction of the
projected workload. Depot maintenance activation planning must be an orderly and disciplined
process for all DLR requirements. To standup depot repair capability, it is essential to develop
plans that address the multiple activities and resources required to stand up depot repair. All
personnel involved in DMAP activities will utilize depot activation plans to direct activities, and
quantify progress of the depot activation efforts.
   A4.2.1. The DMAP is the overarching document that articulates the Program‘s plan to
   execute the entire depot activation effort. The actionable element of this plan is the
   Integrated Master Schedule (IMS). It presents a graphic overview of the (insert I.D. System)
   Depot Activation Team‘s vision of the time-phased activation execution effort.
   A4.2.2. Overall, the DMAP: (1) Charts the course of the Depot Activation Effort; (2)
   Supports POM development and other resourcing decisions; (3) Supports allocation of
   30XX BPXX (depot activation) funds; and (4) Presents a consolidated view of the scope,
   execution effort, and sequence of depot activation.
A4.3. Requirements. The outcome of the DMAP is a successful capability for all DLR
requirements to support weapon system availability.
   A4.3.1. Overall Assumptions:

Group (DMAWG) and issued a DMAWG charter to govern all depot activation. The DMAWG
Charter, signed by the Leadership of each Core Member and the ALC Commander established
the organization and vision for activating repair capability in ALC depots. The DMAWG is
responsible for systematic and orderly development of a depot maintenance capability to support
the projected workload through completion. Accordingly, the DMAWG will manage depot
activations with detailed and defined applicable program documents as listed.
   A4.5.1. (Insert list of applicable documents.)
A4.6. DMAWG Structure. The DMAWG established Maintenance Activation Planning
Teams (MAPTs) consisting of MAPT Chiefs at the ALCs and consultants from the Contractor
and DLA. The ALC MAPT Chiefs are the single point of contact for all ALC requirements. The
MAPTs set up and manage individual Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) which are responsible for
planning and standing up each workload in the depot identified in the Depot Source of Repair
process (DSOR) for the subject workload. The MAPT IPTs will consist of a matrix of depot and
contractor personnel.
