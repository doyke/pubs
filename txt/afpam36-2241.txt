SUMMARY OF CHANGES
There are several minor updates within this edition of the Professional Development Guide (PDG) as the Air Force OPRs
have ensured the information complies with publications dated before 1 June 2013. The first major change is the realignment
of Chapter 2. Chapter 2 was divided into two chapters (Chapter 1, Enlisted History and Chapter 2, Airman Heritage).
Chapter 9, institutional competencies was added within the Enlisted Force Development section. The Studying Effectively
chapter was moved from Chapter 1 to 20 and remains nontestable. Situational leadership was removed and replaced with Full
Range Leadership Development (FRLD). Text contained within the text boxes does not imply the material is any more
important than other text. Finally, chapters 1 through 19 are applicable to Airmen testing for promotion to SSgt through
CMSgt, except for Chapter 17 which is applicable only to personnel testing for promotion to SSgt and TSgt.

Many of you are unaware of the process used to select material for inclusion in AFPAM 36-2241, Professional Development
Guide. Therefore, it is important we mention the role of the MKTS Advisory Council. The MKTS Advisory Council, chaired
by the CMSAF, is comprised of CCMs from all MAJCOMs, selected field operating agencies (FOA), and direct reporting
units (DRU). The council convenes every year to determine the applicability of the information contained in the current PDG
and approves new subject matter for inclusion in the next revision. Members base their decisions on your feedback and the
results of an MKTS field evaluation survey administered to a stratified random sample of approximately 10,000 NCOs
throughout the Air Force. This survey lists, by chapter and section, the content of the PDG and asks that each chapter section
be rated according to whether knowledge of, or skill in, that particular area is necessary to perform at the respondent‘s
present grade. If you have the opportunity to take the survey, please consider your responses carefully. It is your opportunity
to let the CMSAF and other senior enlisted leadership to know what subjects you consider important. After all surveys are
analyzed and the data is compiled, the council will have a clear picture of the subject areas enlisted Airmen want published in
the PDG, and the extent of coverage. Go to http://pdg.af.edu to access the electronic version of the MKTS survey results. The
changes incorporated are a result of feedback received from the field identifying new subject areas, as well as ways to
improve the format, readability, and adequacy of the current subject matter. We seriously consider all suggestions. Our
objective is to provide the enlisted force with a reference that is easy to understand and provides ample coverage of the
subjects you consider appropriate.
Many people ask why we do not do update the PDG as changes occur. The PDG is a snapshot in time. We do not issue
interim changes because interim changes are only used for mission-essential changes. To update the e-publishing Web site
with corrections would have conflicting guidance since the only official publication for the PDG is this publication dated 1
October 2013. We will maintain all corrections, changes, and updates for publication in the next guide, projected for 1
October 2015. You can review previously submitted questions, comments, and identified errors on our Web site listed in the
previous paragraph, but do not use them to alter your guide as they have not yet been officially incorporated.
For your convenience, this publication is available electronically at the Air Force e-Publishing Web site at www.e-

                                      AIR FORCE TEST COMPROMISE POLICY
WARNING!!! Group study (two or more people) and training programs specifically designed to prepare for
promotion tests are strictly prohibited by AFI 36-2605, Air Force Military Personnel Testing System. This prohibition
protects the integrity of the promotion-testing program by helping to ensure test scores are a reflection of each member‘s
individual effort. Remember, the PFE or USAFSE counts for up to 100 points of your total Weighted Airman Promotion
System (WAPS) or Senior NCO promotion score. Therefore, it is important for you to establish a self-study program that will
help you score well.
In addition to group study, you must avoid other specific compromising situations. They include, but are not limited to,
discussing the contents of a PFE with anyone other than the test control officer or test examiner and sharing pretests or lists
of test questions recalled from a current or previous PFE or USAFSE, personal study materials, or underlined or highlighted
study reference material, or commercial study guides with other individuals.
Air Force members who violate these prohibitions are subject to prosecution, under Article 92 (1) of the Uniform Code of
Military Justice (UCMJ), for violating a lawful general regulation. WAPS was developed as an objective method to promote
the most deserving Airmen to the next higher grade. Any time a promotion examination is compromised, it is possible that
one or more undeserving Airmen will be promoted at the expense of those who followed the rules. Do not place your career
in jeopardy. Study, take your promotion examinations, and earn your next stripe on your own!

                                                  ENLISTED HISTORY
1.1. Introduction.
      The history of the Air Force enlisted corps is long and varied. The United States Air Force traces its origins to the
      establishment of the Aeronautical Division, created on 1 August 1907. The Army, however, first used ―aerial devices‖
      for military purposes during the American Civil War, when President Lincoln created an unofficial balloon section.
      From Benjamin Franklin to the second Seminole War in 1840 to the war with Mexico in 1846, the Army has been
      interested in using balloons for military purposes but never did. Consequently, enlisted support for U.S. military
      aviation began with Civil War balloon operations. This chapter examines how enlisted participation in the many wars
      and conflicts throughout our history helped develop the U.S. Air Force into the greatest Air Force in the World.
      Enlisted Airmen historically comprised some 80 percent of America‘s air forces. From humble beginnings to today‘s
      great U.S. Air Force, the enlisted corps deserves much of the credit for its development and great accomplishments.
1.2. Milestones of World War I (WWI) (1917-1918):
      1.2.1. When the first shots of the Great War were fired in Europe in August 1914, the 1st Aero Squadron mustered a
      dozen officers, 54 enlisted men, and 6 aircraft. By the end of 1915, the squadron counted 44 officers, 224 enlisted
      men, and 23 airplanes. This constituted the entire air arm of the United States Armed Forces.
      1.2.2. By 1916, a second aero squadron was added, assigned to duty in the Philippine Islands, and new training
      facilities were added. In October 1916, plans were laid for 24 squadrons: 7 to serve with the regular Army, 12 with the
      National Guard, and 5 for coastal defense, supplementing balloon units for the field and coast artillery. Each squadron
      was to muster a dozen aircraft. The regular Army squadrons were either organized or in the process of being organized
      by the end of 1916, and all 24 squadrons were formed by early 1917, but only the 1st Aero Squadron was fully
      equipped, manned, and organized when the United States declared war on Germany 6 April 1917.
      1.2.3. By April 1917, the U.S. Army Aviation Section consisted of 131 officers (virtually all pilots or pilots-in-
      training), 1,087 enlisted men, and had fewer than 250 airplanes. Even as the war in Europe dragged on, the U.S.
      Congress refused to appropriate significant funds for Army aeronautics. The Army‘s poor state of preparedness cannot
      be laid entirely at Congress‘ feet. The Army had no plan to enable them to build an air force and did not send trained
      observers to Europe. General staff officers were so out of touch with modern aerial warfare requirements that their
      chief complaint about air personnel was the disrespectful manner in which flying officers flouted regulations by
      refusing to wear their cavalry spurs while flying airplanes.
      1.2.4. Tradition dictated that pilots be drawn from the ranks of commissioned officers, but the Aviation Section soon
      realized the pressing need for trained enlisted personnel to perform duties in supply and construction and to serve
      specialized functions in the emerging aviation-related fields of photo reconnaissance and radio. Most of all, the
      Aviation Section needed mechanics. The war demanded engine mechanics, armament specialists, welders, riggers, and
      sail makers. The Army first pressed factories into service as training sites, but by the end of 1917, the Aviation Section
      began training mechanics and others at a number of special schools and technical institutions. The two largest were in
      St Paul MN and at Kelly Field TX. Later, mechanics and other enlisted specialists were also trained at fields and
      factories in Great Britain and France.
      1.2.5. In addition to the specialized roles directly associated with flying, Air Service enlisted personnel performed a
      wide variety of administration, mess, transport, and medical corps support functions. Construction personnel, who
      built the airfields, hangars, barracks, and other buildings, were often the first enlisted men stationed at various
      overseas locations.
1.3. Milestones of World War II (WWII) (1939-1945).
      Even before the outbreak of hostilities in Europe, the General Headquarters (GHQ) Air Force had begun a massive
      expansion program that would balloon during the following years into the largest air organization in the nation‘s
      history. In 1939, President Franklin D. Roosevelt asked for $300 million for military aviation. The Air Corps planned
      to have 24 operational combat-ready groups by 1941 which would require greatly enhanced manpower, training, and
      equipment.
      1.3.1. The Air Corps Prepares for War:
             1.3.1.1. In 1938, when the United States first took seriously the signs of war in Europe, the Army‘s air arm was
             still split into two cumbersome command organizations: the Army Air Corps and GHQ Air Force. The total
             force included less than 20,000 enlisted members. In 1940, Congress passed the first peacetime conscription law
             in U.S. history. By March 1944 when Air Force manpower reached its high point, 2,104,405 enlisted men and

           women were serving in a virtually independent branch of the armed services. Moreover, they operated a
           sophisticated machine of air war that covered nearly the entire globe.
           1.3.1.2. From 1939 until 1941, the concept of training did not change drastically, but the scale did. Training
           centers expanded and multiplied. Ever larger numbers of new Airmen passed through advanced training as the
           overall goals for assembling combat-ready groups increased. The air corps simply could not build housing fast
           enough or find qualified instructors in sufficient numbers to keep up with the pace. Army officials turned to
           private schools to help meet the demand, and many mechanics, for example, received training in one of the 15
           civilian schools.
     1.3.2. WWII - The Great Central, Cataclysmic 20th Century Event:
           1.3.2.1. More than 2 million enlisted Airmen served in the U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF) during the largest
           war ever. Most of them—aside from a small number of prewar soldiers—were not professional warriors. Some
           carried out routine duties in safe if unfamiliar surroundings, while others endured extreme conditions in faraway
           places for years. Tens of thousands died in combat, and scarcely any remained unchanged by the war.
           1.3.2.2. Before the United States could engage the enemy, it needed more personnel, training, and equipment.
           Thus, 1942 was a year of buildup and training; processes that continued throughout the war. According to one
           former 8th Air Force gunner, ―It took an average of about 30 men to support a bomber—I‘m talking about a
           four-engine bomber, whether it be a B-24 or a B-17, it‘s about the same thing—yet you had to have somebody
           riding a gasoline truck, oil trucks; you had to have a carburetor specialist and armaments and so forth, sheet
           metal work; if you got shot up, they had to patch the holes. These people were very important and they worked
           18 to 20 hours a day when you came back.‖
           1.3.2.3. If anything, the gunner underestimated the number of guys on the ground required to keep planes in the
           air. No accurate figure exists across the board for WWII, but taking into account all the support personnel in the
           Army Air Corps, the ratio was probably closer to 70 men to 1 airplane. During the war, the great majority of the
           more than 2 million enlisted Airmen served in roles that never took them into the air, but without their efforts,
           even the most mundane or menial, no bombs would have dropped and no war would have been waged.
Figure 1.1. Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps.        1.3.2.4. Women served with distinction in the USAAF, replacing men
                                                 who could then be reassigned to combat and other vital duties. The
                                                 Women‘s Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) was created in May 1942
                                                 (Figure 1.1). Top priority for assignment of WAACs was to serve at
                                                 aircraft warning service stations. In the spring of 1943, the WAAC
                                                 became the Women‘s Army Corps (WAC). Almost half of their peak
                                                 strength served with the USAAF with many assigned to clerical and
                                                 administrative duties, while others worked as topographers, medical
                                                 specialists, chemists, and even aircraft mechanics. Some commanders
                                                 were reluctant to accept women into their units, but by mid-1943, the
                                                 demand for them far exceeded the numbers available.
                                                  1.3.2.5. When the Air Force became a distinct service in 1947,
                                                  segregation policies were transferred, but the new organization
                                                  confronted special difficulties in maintaining the separation, especially in
                                                  the case of enlisted Airmen. Official restrictions that forced black Airmen
                                                  to serve either in all-black units or in segregated service squads robbed
                                                  the Air Force of a major talent pool. On 11 May 1949, Air Force Letter
                                                  35.3 was published, mandating that black Airmen be screened for
                                                  reassignment to formerly all-white units according to qualifications.
                                                  Astoundingly, within a year, virtually the entire Air Force was integrated,
                                                  with few incidents.
           1.3.2.6. In the spring of 1945, after 3 1/2 years of carnage, the end of the war seemed inevitable. The 1944
           invasion of Europe and Allied ground forces‘ grinding advance toward Berlin finally destroyed Germany. The
           Third Reich surrendered in May 1945. With Europe calmed, American forces turned their attention to Japan.
           The American high command expected the final struggle in the Pacific would require relentless attacks against a
           fanatical foe. Despite widespread destruction of Japanese cities by low-level B-29 fire bombings throughout the
           spring and summer of 1945, Japan continued to resist. U.S. commanders realized that only an American
           invasion of the Japanese islands and subjugation of the Japanese would force the empire to surrender
           unconditionally, as the Allies demanded.

             1.3.2.7. USAAF enlisted crews flew thousands of combat missions during WWII but two missions over Japan
             in August 1945 changed the world: the flight of the Enola Gay (Figure 1.2), 6 August 1945, to drop the world‘s
             first nuclear bomb on Hiroshima; and the flight of Bock‘s Car (Figure 1.3), 3 days later to drop the second
             bomb on the city of Nagasaki.

1.4. The Cold War (1948-1991).
      Although the United States and its Western allies had counted on the Soviet Union as a heroic nation struggling with
      them against Hitler, it was apparent even before WWII ended that the alliance would not survive the ideological gulf
      that separated capitalist democracies from the Communist giant. In 1945, the Big Three—British Prime Minister
      Winston Churchill, Soviet Premier Josef Stalin, and American President Franklin D. Roosevelt—met to discuss the
      postwar division of Europe. The meeting did not go well, but it did lay the foundation for what would become the
      United Nations (UN). In 1946, the fledgling UN took up the issue of controlling nuclear weapons. By June 1946, an
      UN-appointed commission completed a plan for the elimination of nuclear weaponry based on inspectors who would
      travel the globe to ensure no country was making atomic bombs, and to supervise the dismantling of existing weapons.
      Unfortunately, the plan was vetoed by the Soviet Union, resulting in almost five decades of cold war.
1.5. The Berlin Airlift (1948-1949):
      1.5.1. In June 1948, the Soviet Union exploited the arrangements under which the United States, Great Britain, and
      France had occupied Germany by closing off all surface access to the city of Berlin. If left unchallenged, the
      provocative actions of the communists may not only have won them an important psychological victory, but may also
      have given them permanent control over all of Berlin. Worried that an attempt to force the blockade on the ground
      could precipitate World War III, the allies instead built a Luftbrücke—an air bridge—into Berlin.
      1.5.2. For their part, the Soviets did not believe resupply of the city by air was feasible, let alone practical. The Air
      Force turned to Major General William Tunner, who led the Hump airlift over the Himalayan mountains to supply
      China during WWII. As the nation‘s leading military air cargo expert, he thoroughly analyzed U.S. airlift capabilities
      and requirements and set in motion an airlift operation that would save a city.
      1.5.3. For 15 months, the 2.2 million inhabitants of the Western sectors of Berlin were sustained by airpower alone as
      the operation flew in 2.33 million tons of supplies on 277,569 flights (Figure 1.4). Although airlift came of age during
      WWII, it achieved its full potential during the Berlin airlift, which was arguably airpower‘s single-most decisive
      contribution to the Cold War, unquestionably achieving a profound strategic effect.
      1.5.4. Enlisted personnel served as cargo managers and loaders (with a major assist from German civilians), air traffic
      controllers, communications specialists, and weather and navigation specialists. Of all the enlisted functions, perhaps
      the most critical to the success of the airlift was maintenance. The Soviets‘ eventual capitulation and dismantling of
      the surface blockade represented one of the great Western victories of the Cold War—without dropping a bomb—and
      laid the foundation for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).

                                                               1.6.1. The 25 June 1950 surprise invasion of South Korea by

                                                               prepared to deal with a conventional war in a remote corner of
                                                               the world. The resulting confusion and makeshift responses fell
                                                               short of requirements during the active course of the war;
                                                               conditions made even more difficult by the drastic swings of
                                                               military fortune during 1950 and 1951 on the Korean
                                                               peninsula. The conflict imposed acute difficulties on enlisted
                                                               Airmen, and throughout the Korean War, Airmen were called
                                                               on to serve under the most dangerous and frustrating
                                                               conditions.
                                                               1.6.2. By 1950, most U.S. ground and air strength in the
                                                               Pacific was in Japan. Although the Far East Air Forces
                                                               (FEAF), led by General George Stratemeyer, claimed more
                                                               than 400 aircraft in Japan, Guam, Korea, and the Philippines,
                                                               the numbers were misleading. The force consisted largely of F-
                                                               80 jets, which did not have the range necessary to reach Korea
                                                               from Japan. The first aerial combat between the United States
      and North Korea took place over Kimpo 27 June 1950. On 29 June, B-26 gunner Staff Sergeant Nyle S. Mickley shot
      down a North Korean YaK-3, the first such victory recorded during the war. Enlisted personnel served as gunners
      aboard the B-26 for the first several months of the conflict, and on B-29 aircraft throughout the war.
      1.6.3. On 15 September 1950, U.S. forces spearheaded by the First Marine Division successfully landed at Inchon,
      near Seoul, South Korea, effectively cutting North Korean Army supply lines deep in the south, threatening its rear
      (Figure 1.5). The U.S. Eighth Army launched its own offensive from Pusan a day later, and what once was a stalled
      North Korean offensive became a disorganized retreat. So complete was the rout that less than a third of the 100,000-
      strong North Korean Army escaped to the north. On 27 September 1950, President Truman authorized U.S. forces to
      pursue the beaten Army north of the 38th parallel.

      offensive. Airlift actions ranged from the spectacular, to
      include the drop of the 187th Airborne Regimental
      Combat Team to cut off retreating North Korean troops,
      to the more mundane but critical airlift of personnel and
      supplies. Foreshadowing the versatility that would be
      exhibited by the B-52 in later decades, FEAF B-29s
      performed a number of missions not even considered
      before the war, to include interdiction, battlefield
      support, and air superiority (counter airfield). On 9
      November 1950, Corporal Harry LaVene of the 91st
      Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron, serving as gunner,
      scored the first B-29 victory over a jet by downing a
      MiG-15. LaVene‘s victory was the first of 27 MiGs
      shot down by B-29 gunners during the course of the
      war. Sergeant Billie Beach, a tail gunner on an
      Okinawa-based B-29, shot down two MiGs on 12 April
      1951, a feat unmatched by any other gunner. His own
      plane was so shot up, however, that it and the crew
      barely survived an emergency landing with collapsed
      gear at an advanced fighter strip.
1.7. Cuban Missile Crisis (1962):
      1.7.1. In 1959, Fidel Castro overthrew the dictator of Cuba, initially promising free elections but instead instituted a
      socialist dictatorship. Hundreds of thousands of Cubans fled their island, many coming to the United States. From his
      rhetoric and actions, Castro proved he was a Communist. In late 1960, President Eisenhower authorized the Central
      Intelligence Agency (CIA) to plan an invasion of Cuba using Cuban exiles as troops. President Eisenhower hoped that,
      in conjunction with the invasion, the Cuban people would overthrow Castro and install a pro-U.S. government. The
22                                                                                 1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
      President‘s second term ended before the plan could be implemented. President John F. Kennedy ordered the invasion
      to proceed. In mid-April 1961, the Cuban exiles landed at the Bay of Pigs and suffered a crushing defeat.

                                                            construction of launch pads that, when completed, could be
                                                            used to employ nuclear-armed missiles with a range up to 5,000
                                                            miles. Eleven days later, RF-101s and RB-66s began
                                                            conducting low-level reconnaissance flights, verifying data
                                                            gathered by the U-2s and gathering prestrike intelligence.

      B-47 aircraft to approximately 40 airfields in the United States and keeping numerous B-52 heavy bombers in the air
      ready to strike.
      1.7.4. President Kennedy and his national security advisors debated the most effective course of action. Many on the
      Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) favored invasion, but President Kennedy took the less drastic step of imposing a naval
      blockade of the island, to prevent any more materiel from reaching Cuba. Still technically an act of war, the blockade
      nevertheless had the advantage of not turning the Cold War into a hot one.
      1.7.5. Confronted with the photographic evidence of missiles, the Soviet Union initially responded belligerently.
      Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev accused the United States of degenerate imperialism and declared that the Union of
      Soviet Socialist Republic (USSR) would not observe the illegal blockade. In the ensuing days, Khrushchev softened,
      and then hardened, his position and demands. Tension increased 27 October when Cuban air defenses shot down a U-2
      piloted by Major Rudolf Anderson.
      1.7.6. The JCS recommended an immediate air strike against Cuba, but President Kennedy decided to wait. The
      military tempo continued to increase unabated. While military preparation continued, the United States agreed not to
      invade Cuba in exchange for removal of Soviet missiles from the island. Secretly, the United States also agreed to
      remove American missiles from Turkey. The Soviets turned their Cuba-bound ships around, packed up the missiles in
      Cuba, and dismantled the launch pads. As the work progressed, the Air Force deployed aircraft back to home bases
      and lowered the alert status.
      1.7.7. The Cuban Missile Crisis brought the world dangerously close to nuclear war. The strategic and tactical power
      of the U.S. Air Force, coupled with the will and ability to use it, provided the synergy to deter nuclear war with the
      USSR and convince the Soviets to remove the nuclear weapons from Cuba.
1.8. The War in Southeast Asia (1950-1975).
      The Truman Administration did not pursue total victory in Korea in part to maintain U.S. defensive emphasis on
      Western Europe. The next major conflict for the U.S. Armed Forces, however, once again took place in Asia.
      1.8.1. The Early Years (1950-1964):
            1.8.1.1. In the 1950s, the United States‘ involvement in Vietnam began as a cold war operation. Vietnam was
            essentially a French battle. However, the post WWII policy of containment of communism prompted President
            Truman to intervene. He increased aid and ordered eight C-47 transports directly to Saigon, the first air force
            presence in Vietnam. On 3 August 1950, the first contingent of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group
            (MAAG) arrived in Saigon.
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                           23

            1.8.1.2. By 1952, the United States supplied one-third of the cost of the French military effort in Vietnam, yet it
            was becoming apparent that the French were losing heart. On 4 January 1953, the United States deployed the
            first sizable contingent of Air Force personnel (other than those attached to the MAAG). This group included a
            complement of enlisted technicians (Figure 1.7) to handle supply and aircraft maintenance.
Figure 1.7. Enlisted Technicians.                             1.8.1.3. In April 1953, the Viet Minh (under Ho Chi Minh‘s
                                                              direction) staged a major offensive, advancing into Laos and
                                                              menacing Thailand. President Eisenhower authorized C-119
                                                              transports (aircraft only, not crews) to the area, and in 1954
                                                              loaned additional cargo planes to the French. Because French
                                                              air units were seriously undermanned, U.S. officials made the
                                                              fateful decision on 31 January 1954 to dispatch 300 Airmen to
                                                              service aircraft at Tourane and Do Son Airfield near Haiphong.
                                                              1.8.1.4. As Air Force presence increased in the early 1960s, so
                                                              did the need for support personnel. Priorities included
                                                              construction of airfields and barracks, and intelligence-
                                                              gathering.
                                                              1.9. The Air War Expands (1965-1968):
                                                             1.9.1. On 7 February 1965, the Viet Cong attacked Camp
                                                             Holloway near Pleiku, killing eight Americans. The President
                                                             responded with Operation Flaming Dart, a series of strikes
                                                             against military barracks near Dong Hoi in North Vietnam, as
      well as other targets. Increased airstrikes against targets in the northern half of the country, code name Rolling
      Thunder, began less than a month later on 2 March. Rolling Thunder was the first sustained bombing campaign of the
      war against North Vietnam, lasting through 1968.
      1.9.2. As offensive air operations increased, U.S. Air Force presence in Southeast Asia also increased. About 10,000
      Air Force personnel served in Vietnam in May 1965, doubling by the end of the year. As 1968 drew to a close, 58,000
      Airmen served in the country. Airmen performed various duties, including support, combat and rescue (Figure 1.8).
      Prime BEEF personnel, for example, built revetments, barracks, and other facilities. Rapid engineering and heavy
      operational repair squadron, engineering (REDHORSE) teams provided more long-range civil engineer services. In
      the realm of combat operations, Air Force gunners flew aboard gunships as well as B-57s and B-52s. In December
      1972, B-52 tail gunner Staff Sergeant Samuel Turner shot down an enemy MiG, the first of only two confirmed shoot-
      downs by enlisted Airmen during the war. Both victories were from gunners belonging to the 307th Strategic Wing at
      U-Tapao, Thailand. Credit for the fifth overall MiG-21 kill during Linebacker II also went to an enlisted member,
      Airman First Class Albert E. Moore.
      1.9.3. Enlisted personnel also served on gunships            Figure 1.8. Medical Evacuation System.
      during the war as both aerial gunners and as
      loadmasters. With the Gatling-style guns actually aimed
      by the pilot through speed, bank, and altitude, the
      responsibility of the aerial gunners was to keep the
      quick-firing guns reloaded. Crewmembers occupying
      this position were particularly vulnerable to ground fire.
      Meanwhile, loadmasters released flare canisters over
      target areas during night missions, another hazardous
      undertaking.
      1.9.4. Air Force enlisted members faced combat on the
      ground as well. With the continuing threat of guerrilla
      attack, air base defense became a monumental
      undertaking performed almost exclusively by Air Force
      security police squadrons. Staff Sergeant William
      Piazza, 3d Security Police Squadron earned the Silver
      Star for helping defend Bien Hoa during the North
      Vietnamese Tet Offensive of 1968.

1.10. Vietnamization and Withdrawal (1969-1973):
      1.10.1. Since the Eisenhower years, American presidents wanted the Vietnam conflict to be fought and resolved by the
      Vietnamese. Through 1963 and much of 1964, American forces operated under restrictive rules of engagement in an
      effort to maintain the U.S. role as advisory only. On 22 November 1963, embroiled in a deteriorating situation in
      Vietnam, President Kennedy was assassinated and Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson took office. After the Gulf of
      Tonkin incident and the Senate resolution of 1964, the advisory role rapidly evolved into one of combat operations.
      Yet the Air Force never stopped working with the Vietnamese Air Force to develop its ability to prosecute the war
      itself. In January 1969, shortly after taking office, President Nixon announced an end to U.S. combat in Southeast Asia
      as a primary goal of his administration. He charged the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) with making Vietnamization
      of the war a top priority.
      1.10.2. Enlisted Airmen played key roles, especially in training Vietnamese operational and training crews. As the
      Vietnamese took over air operations, the nation‘s air force grew to become the fourth largest in the world. In May
      1969, the withdrawal of U.S. Army ground units from Vietnam began in earnest, while air support units lingered. In
      1972, taking advantage of reduced American ground presence, Communist forces of the National Liberation Front
      crossed the demilitarized zone. President Nixon ordered harbors mined. Peace talks broke down completely.
      1.10.3. President Nixon ordered 11 days of intensive bombing of Vietnamese cites, with B-52s from Andersen AFB
      Guam, carrying out the mission called ―Linebacker II.‖ Linebacker II succeeded in breaking the deadlock, and the
      North Vietnamese resumed negotiations. A cease-fire agreement was hammered out by 28 January 1973.
      1.10.4. While Linebacker II was a success, Vietnam was no ordinary war. The cease-fire did not bring an end to the
      fighting, and the punishment aircrews delivered did not bring victory. Nevertheless, the United States was committed
      to withdrawal. On 27 January 1973, the military draft ended; on 29 March, the last U.S. troop left the country; and
      even though another cease-fire agreement was drawn up to end previous cease-fire violations, fighting continued until
      April 22 when the president of South Vietnam resigned. North and South Vietnam were officially unified under a
      Communist regime on 2 July 1976.
1.11. Humanitarian Airlift:
      1.11.1. The history of humanitarian airlift by U.S. Armed Forces is almost as old as the history of flight itself. Army
      aircraft flying out of Kelly Field TX, for example, dropped food to victims of a Rio Grande flood in 1919, one of the
      first known uses of an aircraft to render assistance. Many early domestic humanitarian flights were flown in response
      to winter emergencies. In March 1923, Aberdeen Proving Ground MD sent airplanes to bomb an ice jam on the
      Delaware River and an aircraft from Chanute Field IL dropped food to stranded people on South Fox Island in Lake
      Michigan. From blizzards and floods to volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, Army Air Corps personnel and aircraft
      provided relief.
      1.11.2. Army aircraft also flew humanitarian missions to foreign nations before the United States Air Force was
      established. In February 1939, the 2d Bombardment Wing delivered medical supplies to earthquake victims in Chile.
      Four years later, in the midst of WWII, a B-24 from a base in Guatemala dropped a life raft with the diphtheria vaccine
      to a destroyer escorting a British aircraft carrier. The destroyer delivered the vaccine to the carrier, preventing a
      shipboard epidemic. In September 1944, USAAF planes dropped food to starving French citizens; in May 1945, B-17s
      delivered food to hungry people in the Netherlands during Operation Chowhound.
      1.11.3. Humanitarian efforts continued after the Air Force became a separate service and through the ensuing decades.
      During Operation Safe Haven I and II, in 1956 and 1957, the Military Air Transport Service (MATS) 1608th Air
      Transport Wing, Charleston AFB SC, and 1611th Air Transport Wing, McGuire AFB NJ, airlifted over 10,000
      Hungarian refugees to the United States. President Eisenhower approved asylum for the refugees who fled Hungary
      after Soviet forces crushed an anticommunist uprising there. In May 1960, earthquakes followed by volcanic
      eruptions, avalanches, and tidal waves ripped through southern Chile, leaving nearly 10,000 people dead and a quarter
      of a million homeless. The U.S. Department of Defense and State Department agreed to provide assistance. During the
      month-long ―Amigos Airlift,‖ the 63d Troop Carrier Wing from Donaldson AFB SC and the 1607th, 1608th, and
      1611th Air Transport Wings airlifted over 1,000 tons of material to the stricken area.
      1.11.4. America‘s commitment to South Vietnam led to many relief flights to that country during the 1960s and 1970s.
      In November 1964, three typhoons dumped 40-plus inches of rain on the country‘s central highlands, killing 7,000
      people and destroying 50,000 homes. HH-43F helicopters from Detachment 5, Pacific Air Rescue Center, plucked 80
      Vietnamese from rooftops and high ground in the immediate aftermath of the storms. Over the next 2 months, various
      Air Force units moved more than 2,000 tons of food, fuel, boats, and medicine to the ravaged area. Less than a year
      later, in August 1965, fighting in Da Nang displaced 400 orphaned children. To move them out of harm‘s way, 315th
      Air Division C-130s airlifted the orphans to Saigon. In 1975, following the fall of Cambodia and South Vietnam to
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                          25

      Communist forces, transports from 11 Air Force wings and other units airlifted more than 50,000 refugees to the
      United States. This airlift, which included Operations Babylift, New Life, Frequent Wind, and New Arrivals, was the
      largest aerial evacuation in history. In addition to refugees, Air Force units also moved 5,000 relief workers and more
      than 8,500 tons of supplies.
      1.11.5. Aside from the Vietnamese evacuation of the 1970s and the Berlin airlift in the late 1940s, the most significant
      humanitarian airlift operations took place in the 1990s. In 1991, following the Persian Gulf War, Iraqi leader Saddam
      Hussein attacked the Kurdish population in northern Iraq. In response to the unfolding human tragedy, Air Force
      transports in support of Operation Provide Comfort provided more than 7,000 tons of blankets, tents, food, and more
      to the displaced Kurds, and airlifted thousands of refugees and medical personnel. Operation Sea Angel, in which the
      Air Force airlifted 3,000 tons of supplies to Bangladesh, followed a 1991 typhoon. Operation Provide Hope in 1992
      and 1993 provided 6,000 tons of food, medicine, and other cargo to republics of the former Soviet Union. In 1994, the
      Air Force carried 3,600 tons of relief supplies to Rwandan refugees in war-torn central Africa.
1.12. Post-Vietnam Conflicts:
      1.12.1. Operation Urgent Fury, Grenada (1983):
            1.12.1.1. In October 1983, a military coup on the tiny Caribbean island nation of Grenada aroused U.S.
            attention. Coup leaders arrested and then assassinated Prime Minister Maurice Bishop, imposed a 24-hour
            shoot-on-sight curfew, and closed the airport at Pearls on the east coast, about 12 miles from the capital of St.
            George‘s, located on the opposite side of the island. President Ronald W. Reagan, who did not want a repetition
            of the Iranian hostage crisis a few years earlier, considered military intervention to rescue hundreds of U.S.
            citizens attending medical school on the island.
            1.12.1.2. Twenty-six Air Force wings, groups, and squadrons supported the invasion by 1,900 U.S. Marines and
            Army Rangers. Airlift and special operations units from the Military Airlift Command (MAC) comprised the
            bulk of the Air Force fighting force. AC-130 gunships in particular proved their worth repeatedly, showing
            more versatility and accuracy than naval bombardment and land artillery. Several Air Force enlisted personnel
            were among 10 Air Force Grenada veterans cited for special achievement who received special praise for their
            efforts. Among them, Sergeant Charles Tisby, a loadmaster, saved the life of an unidentified paratrooper in his
            aircraft. When his C-130 banked sharply to avoid antiaircraft fire, one paratrooper‘s static line fouled and left
            the trooper still attached to the aircraft. Tisby, with the help of paratroopers still on board, managed—at
            significant personal risk—to haul the man back in.
      1.12.2. El Dorado Canyon, Libya (1986):
            1.12.2.1. In 1969, a group of junior military officers led by Muammar Qadhafi overthrew the pro-Western
            Libyan Arab monarchy. By the mid-1980s, Libya was one of the leading sponsors of worldwide terrorism. In
            addition to subversion or direct military intervention against other African nations and global assassinations of
            anti-Qadhafi Libyan exiles and other ―state enemies,‖ Qadhafi sponsored terrorist training camps within Libya
            and supplied funds, weapons, logistical support, and safe havens for numerous terrorist groups.
            1.12.2.2. Between January 1981 and April 1986, terrorists worldwide killed over 300 Americans and injured
            hundreds more. With National Security Decision Directive 138 signed on 3 April 1984, President Reagan
            established in principle a U.S. policy of preemptive and retaliatory strikes against terrorists. On 27 December
            1985, terrorists attacked passengers in the Rome and Vienna airports. Despite the strong evidence that
            connected Libya to the incident, the U.S. administration determined that it did not have sufficient proof to order
            retaliatory strikes against Libya. President Reagan imposed sanctions against Libya, publicly denounced
            Qadhafi for sponsoring the operation, and sent the 6th Fleet to exercise off the coast of Libya.
            1.12.2.3. In Berlin, 5 April 1986, a large bomb gutted a discotheque popular with U.S. service members. This
            time President Reagan had the evidence he sought. On 9 April, he authorized an air strike against Libya and
            attempted to obtain support from European allies. Great Britain gave permission for the United States Air Force
            to use British bases; however, the governments of France and Spain denied permission to fly over their
            countries, thereby increasing the Air Force‘s round trip to almost 6,000 miles. By 14 April 1986, all Air Force
            forces were gathered and ready.
            1.12.2.4. Politically, the raid against the terrorist state was extremely popular in the United States and almost
            universally condemned or ―regretted‖ by the United States‘ European allies who feared that the raid would
            spawn more violence. The operation spurred Western European governments to increase their defenses against
            terrorism and their intelligence agencies began to share information. The Air Force was saddened by the loss of
            an F-111F crew, but the loss of one out of over a 100 aircraft used in the raid statistically was not a high toll.
26                                                                                  1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
            Despite the high abort rate, collateral damage, and loss of innocent lives—after a flight of more than 6 hours
            and in the face of strong enemy opposition—the Air Force successfully hit three targets previously seen only in
            photographs.
      1.12.3. Operation Just Cause, Panama (1989):
            1.12.3.1. Since Panama‘s declaration of independence from Columbia in 1903, the United States has maintained
            a special interest in this small Central American country. The United States controlled and occupied the Panama
            Canal Zone, through which it built a 40-mile long canal to connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. President
            Woodrow Wilson formally opened the canal on 12 July 1915. Political and domestic conditions in Panama
            remained stable until 1968, when a military ruler deposed the country‘s president. A new treaty took effect 1
            October 1979, granting Panama complete control of the canal and dictating withdrawal of U.S. military forces
            by 1 January 2000.
            1.12.3.2. A 1981 leadership struggle culminated in 1983; Manuel Noriega prevailed. Noriega maintained ties
            with the U.S. intelligence community, furnishing information on Latin American drug trafficking and money
            laundering, while at the same time engaging in such activities. By 1987, brutal repression of his people was
            enough for the U.S. Senate to issue a resolution calling for the Panamanians to oust him. Noriega in turn
            ordered an attack on the U.S. Embassy, causing an end to U.S. military and economic aid. In 1988, a Miami
            federal grand jury indicted Noriega on drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges. Noriega intensified his
            harassment against his own people and all Americans. By 1989, President George H. W. Bush decided to
            invade Panama.
            1.12.3.3. All four branches of the U.S. Armed Forces played a role in Operation Just Cause. Air Force
            participation included elements of 18 wings, 9 groups, and 17 types of aircraft. On the first night of the
            operation, 84 aircraft flying 500 feet above the ground dropped nearly 5,000 troops, the largest nighttime
            airborne operation since WWII. The airdrop also featured the first Air Force personnel use of night vision
            goggles during a contingency.
            1.12.3.4. Operation Just Cause was the largest and most complex air operation since Vietnam. It involved more
            than 250 aircraft. American forces eliminated organized resistance in just 6 days. Manuel Noriega surrendered 3
            January 1990 and was flown to Miami FL to face trial. Less than a year later, many of the same Airmen that
            made Operation Just Cause a resounding success would build and travel another, larger air bridge during
            Operation Desert Shield.
1.13. Gulf War I (1990):
      1.13.1. Persian Gulf War and Subsequent Operations:
            1.13.1.1. The Gulf War was no surprise to anyone except perhaps Saddam Hussein. After prevailing in an 8-
            year war with Iran that was so costly it nearly led to a military coup, Saddam Hussein invaded and attempted to
            annex the small, oil-rich nation of Kuwait on 2 August 1990. During his occupation of the country, he
            plundered it and brutalized the population. The invasion put Iraq, with the fourth largest Army in the world and
            an extensive program to develop nuclear weapons, on the doorstep of Saudi Arabia with its vast petroleum
            reserves. If the Saudis also fell to Iraq, the dictator would control 50 percent of the world‘s oil.
            1.13.1.2. The United States sought and received a UN sanction to act against Iraq and joined 27 other nations to
            launch Operation Desert Shield, a massive military buildup in Saudi Arabia near the border of Iraq, aimed first
            at deterring Saddam Hussein from aggression against the Saudis and then to prepare the way for a
            counterinvasion, if necessary. U.S. President George Bush demanded the immediate withdrawal of Iraqi forces
            from Kuwait. Saddam believed that, since Vietnam, the American public lacked the stomach for war. For more
            than 6 months he alternated between defiance and vague promises of compliance.
      1.13.2. Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, Kuwait and Iraq (1990-1991):
            1.13.2.1. By the time President Bush launched Operation Desert Shield, the U.S. Air Force and its sister
            services had moved a considerable distance toward a unified conventional war-fighting capability. The
            defensive deployment in itself was an impressive accomplishment. On 8 August 1990, 24 F-15Cs landed in
            Saudi Arabia after taking off 15 hours earlier from Langley AFB VA, some 8,000 miles away. Within 5 days,
            C-5 and C-141 airlifters had escorted in 5 fighter squadrons, an airborne warning and control system (AWACS)
            contingent, and an airborne brigade: 301 planes altogether. On 21 August, SECDEF Richard Cheney announced
            that sufficient force was in place to defend Saudi Arabia. A month into the crisis, 1,220 Allied aircraft were in
            theater and combat ready. When Saddam Hussein missed the final deadline to withdraw his troops from Kuwait,
            Operation Desert Storm began 15 January 1991.
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                           27

            1.13.2.2. Within the first 24 hours of Desert Storm, the air war was essentially won. The Iraqi air force hardly
            showed its face. Having established air dominance, coalition air forces turned their attention to entrenched
            ground forces, pounding them into a frightened mass ready to surrender to the first allied troops they saw. In the
            final stages of the air war, the Air Force began ―tank plinking,‖ or destroying Iraqi tanks on the ground one at a
            time (Figure 1.9).

                                                              Air Force historian Dr Richard Hallion said, ―From the
                                                              suppliers to the line crews sweating under the desert sun, the
                                                              coalition‘s maintainers worked miracles, enabling ever-higher
                                                              sortie rates as the war progressed—essentially, a constant
                                                              surge.‖ Not all enlisted Airmen worked on maintenance crews.
                                                              In addition to traditional enlisted functions, there were new
                                                              duties, some of which were quite high tech. Two less known
                                                              jobs were electronic emissions collection and analysis,
                                                              undertaken with electronic warfare officers (EWO) and
                                                              airborne intelligence technicians. Electronic intelligence was
                                                              characterized by long hours of work on station and meticulous,
                                                              patient review of enemy transmissions, shot through with brief
                                                              but urgently explosive moments when life or death information
                                                              was quickly transmitted to the right people.
                                                              1.13.2.4. On 28 February 1991, scarcely 48 hours after the air
                                                              war ended and the land invasion took center stage, Iraq
            surrendered to the coalition. In the 43-day war, the Air Force was, for the first time in modern combat, the equal
            partner of land and sea power. The Air Force went into the Gulf talking in cold war terms about air superiority
            and sustainable casualties; it came out trumpeting air supremacy and minimum or no casualties. Within 6
            months, 27 September 1991, strategic bomber crews were ordered to stand down from their decades-long
            round-the-clock readiness for nuclear war. The Cold War was officially over, a new world had arrived, and the
            role of enlisted Airmen changed.
1.14. Operations Provide Comfort and Northern Watch, Iraq (1991-2003):
      1.14.1. When the American-led international coalition bombed Iraq and drove the forces of Iraq from Kuwait in 1991,
      it weakened Saddam Hussein‘s power. Rebellious Kurds in northern Iraq, whom Hussein brutally suppressed with
      chemical weapons 3 years earlier, launched an uprising in early March 1991. When Iraqi government troops defeated
      the rebellion a month later, threatening to repeat the massacres of the past, more than a million Kurds fled to Iran and
      Turkey. Hundreds of thousands more gathered on cold mountain slopes on the Iraqi-Turkish border. Lacking food,
      clean water, clothing, blankets, medical supplies, and shelter, the refugees suffered enormous mortality rates.
      1.14.2. On 3 April 1991, the UN Security Council authorized a humanitarian relief effort for the Iraqi Kurds. During
      the first week in April, the United States organized a combined task force for Operation Provide Comfort. About 600
      pallets of relief supplies were delivered per day, but airdrops alone proved inadequate. Moreover, the operation failed
      to address the root of the problem. The refugees could not stay where they were, and Turkey, faced with a restless
      Kurdish population of its own, refused to admit them in large numbers. Operation Provide Comfort, therefore, evolved
      into a larger-phased operation for American ground troops.
      1.14.3. After 1993, Saddam Hussein rarely challenged coalition aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones, but U.S. units
      remained wary. On 14 April 1994, two American F-15s patrolling the northern no-fly zone accidentally shot down two
      UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, killing 26 people, including 15 Americans. Misidentifying the helicopters as hostile,
      the F-15 pilots failed to receive contrary information from either the helicopters or an orbiting E-3 aircraft. The
      friendly fire incident aroused negative public opinion and a demand for changes to prevent such accidents in the
      future.
      1.14.4. Phase II of Operation Provide Comfort ended in December 1996, thanks largely to infighting among Kurdish
      factions vying for power. When one Kurdish group accepted Iraqi backing to drive another from the northern Iraqi city
      of Irbil, U.S. transports participating in Operations Quick Transit I, II, and III airlifted many displaced Kurds to safe
      areas in Turkey. During Operation Pacific Haven, 7,000 refugees proceeded to Guam for settlement in the United
      States.
28                                                                                    1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
      1.14.5. Operation Northern Watch, which began 1 January 1997 with an initial mandate of 6 months, succeeded
      Operation Provide Comfort. Operation Northern Watch officially ended 17 March 2003, 2 days before Operation Iraqi
      Freedom began.
1.15. Operation Southern Watch, Iraq (1992-2003):
      1.15.1. On 26 August 1992, to discourage renewed Iraqi military activity near Kuwait, President George H. W. Bush
      announced a no-fly zone in southern Iraq in support of United Nations Security Council Resolution 688, Operation
      Southern Watch.
      1.15.2. The resolution protected Shiite Muslims under aerial attack from the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein in the
      aftermath of Operation Desert Storm and enforced other UN sanctions against Iraq. The Iraqi regime complied with
      the restrictions of the no-fly zone until 27 December 1992. F-16s shot down one Iraqi MiG-25 and chased a second
      aircraft back across the border.
      1.15.3. Less than a month later, Air Force aircraft attacked surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites threatening coalition
      aircraft. In June, the United States launched cruise missile strikes against the Iraq Intelligence Service Headquarters in
      Baghdad as retaliation for the planned assassination of former U.S. President George Bush during an April 1993 visit
      to Kuwait.
      1.15.4. In October 1994, Iraqi troops, including elite Republican Guard units, massed at the Kuwaiti border. The
      United States responded with Operation Vigilant Warrior, the introduction of thousands of additional U.S. Armed
      Forces personnel into the theater. Operation Southern Watch became the United States Air Force test for the Air and
      Space Expeditionary Force (AEF) concept in October 1995, when a composite unit designed to replace temporarily a
      United States Navy carrier air wing leaving the gulf area arrived to support flying operations. The AEF arrived fully
      armed and began flying within 12 hours of landing. The AEF concept proved sound. Additional AEFs have since
      deployed to support Operation Southern Watch.
      1.15.5. In 1997, in response to Iraqi aggression against Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq, President William Clinton
      expanded the Operation Southern Watch no-fly zone to the 33d parallel, just south of Baghdad. The expansion meant
      that most of Iraqi airspace fell into no-fly zones.
      1.15.6. One of the most important improvements in both flying operations and the quality of life for members resulted
      directly from the 1996 bombing at Khobar Towers, Dhahran Air Base (AB). In the aftermath, the Air Force reviewed
      its entire security police, law enforcement, and force protection programs. In 1998, the Air Force reorganized existing
      security police units into new security forces groups and squadrons that trained and specialized in all aspects of force
      protection, including terrorist activity and deployed force security. Operation Southern Watch officially ended 26
      August 2003.
1.16. Operations Provide Relief, Impressive Lift, and Restore Hope—Somalia (1992-1994):
      1.16.1. Civil unrest in the wake of a 2-year civil war contributed to a famine in Somalia that killed up to 350,000
      people in 1992. As many as 800,000 refugees fled the stricken country. The UN-led relief effort began in July 1992.
      To relieve the suffering of refugees near the Kenya-Somalia border and then Somalia itself, the United States initiated
      Operation Provide Relief in August 1992. By December, the United States airlifted 38 million pounds of food into the
      region, sometimes under a hail of small arms fire. Continued civil war and clan fighting within Somalia, however,
      prevented much of the relief supplies from getting to those who most desperately needed them.
      1.16.2. First the UN, then the United States, attempted to alleviate the problem. In September, the United States
      initiated Operation Impressive Lift to airlift hundreds of Pakistani soldiers under the UN banner to Somalia. Despite
      increased security from the UN forces, the problems continued. On 4 December, President George Bush authorized
      Operation Restore Hope to establish order in the country so that food could reach those in need. Marines landed and
      assumed control of the airport, allowing flights in and out of Mogadishu, Somalia, to resume. C-5 Galaxies, C-141
      Starlifters, C-130 Hercules, and even KC-10 tankers rushed supplies into the country. Further, the Operation Restore
      Hope airlift brought 32,000 U.S. troops into Somalia. In March 1993, the UN once again assumed control of the
      mission, and Operation Restore Hope officially ended 4 May 1993. Fewer than 5,000 of the 25,000 U.S. troops
      originally deployed remained in Somalia. Unfortunately, factional fighting within the country caused the relief effort
      to unravel yet again. On 3 October 1993, U.S. special forces troops, in an effort to capture members of one clan, lost
      18 personnel and suffered 84 wounded.
      1.16.3. Losses sustained on 3 and 4 October prompted Operation Restore Hope II, the airlifting of 1,700 U.S. troops
      and 3,100 tons of cargo into Mogadishu between 5 and 13 October 1993. The troops and equipment were tasked with
      only stabilizing the situation. President Clinton refused to commit the United States to ―nation building‖ and promised
      to remove U.S. forces by March 1994. Operation Restore Hope II officially ended 25 March 1994 when the last C-5
AFPAM36-2241        1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                             29

      carrying U.S. troops departed Mogadishu. While Operation Restore Hope II allowed U.S. forces to get out of the
      country without further casualties, anarchy ruled in Somalia and the threat of famine remained.
1.17. Operation Uphold Democracy, Haiti (1994):
      1.17.1. The United States decided to intervene in Haiti on 8 September 1994. The U.S. Atlantic Command developed
      two different Operation Uphold Democracy plans: one for forcible entry and the other for passive entry. U.S. Air
      Force planners worked through evolving variations, not knowing which plan would be implemented. At nearly the last
      minute, a diplomatic proposal that former President James (Jimmy) E. Carter offered persuaded the military leader in
      Haiti to relinquish control. The unexpected decision caused a mission change from invasion to insertion of a
      multinational peacekeeping force. On 19 September 1994, the JCS directed execution of the passive-entry plan. For
      the Air Force, this meant activating an aerial force of more than 200 aircraft: transports, special operations, and
      surveillance planes.
      1.17.2. U.S. Air Force participation effectively ended 12 October 1994 when resupply of U.S. forces became routinely
      scheduled airlift missions and deployed aircraft and crews returned home. On 15 October 1994, the Haitian president
      returned to his country, the beneficiary of a strong U.S. response to an oppressive dictator. As in Panama, the Air
      Force brought to bear an overwhelming force of fighters, command and control aircraft, gunships and other special
      operations aircraft, reconnaissance airplanes, aerial refueling tankers, and thousands of troops aboard the airlift fleet of
      strategic and tactical aircraft. The successful adaptation to the last-minute change in mission, from military invasion
      force to airlifting peacekeeping troops, was a major indicator of the flexibility airpower offers U.S. military and
      political leaders in fulfilling foreign policy objectives.
1.18. Operation Provide Promise, Sarajevo and Bosnia-Herzegovina (1992-1996):
      1.18.1. By 1991, the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, coupled with the disintegration
      of the Soviet Union itself, dissolved the political cement that bound ethnically diverse Yugoslavia into a single nation.
      Freed from the threat of external domination, Roman Catholic Slovenia and Croatia declared their independence from
      the Yugoslav federation dominated by Eastern Orthodox Serbia. In early 1992, predominantly Muslim Bosnia-
      Herzegovina (Bosnia) also severed its ties to the Federation. Fearing their minority status, armed Serbs within Bosnia
      began forming their ethnic state by seizing territory and, in the spring, besieging the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo.
      1.18.2. In April 1992, the United States recognized Bosnia‘s independence and began airlifting relief supplies to
      Sarajevo. On 3 July 1992, the United States designated operations in support of the UN airlift Operation Provide
      Promise and United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) C-130s began delivering food and medical supplies.
      1.18.3. Most United States Air Force missions flew out of Rhein-Main AB in Frankfurt, Germany. C-130s from the
      435th and 317th Airlift Wings flew the initial Operation Provide Promise missions, but over the course of the
      operation, Air Force Reserve (AFR), Air National Guard (ANG), and active duty units rotated from the United States
      on 3-week deployments. Although the United States was only one of at least 15 countries airlifting relief supplies to
      Sarajevo, by the end of 1992, U.S. airplanes had delivered more than 5,400 tons of food and medical supplies.
      1.18.4. Inaugurated during the Bush administration, Operation Provide Promise expanded significantly after President
      Clinton took office. He acted in response to continued attacks by Bosnian Serbs on Sarajevo and on the relief aircraft
      themselves. A secondary mission, Operation Provide Santa, took place in December 1993 when C-130s dropped 50
      tons of toys and children‘s clothes and shoes over Sarajevo. A month later, an Operation Provide Promise C-130 was
      the first U.S. Air Force aircraft to suffer damage from the operation when it was struck by an artillery shell at the
      Sarajevo airport. Despite the fact there were no injuries and the damage was minor, the UN suspended flights for a
      week.
      1.18.5. On 14 December 1995, warring factions signed peace accords at Wright-Patterson AFB OH. The last
      humanitarian air-land delivery into Sarajevo took place on 4 January 1996. During the 3 1/2-year operation, aircraft
      supporting the UN-relief operation withstood 279 incidents of ground fire.
1.19. Operation Deny Flight, Bosnia (1993-1995):
      1.19.1. NATO Operation Deny Flight was an effort to limit the war in Bosnia through imposition of a no-fly zone over
      the country. There was only one non-American in the NATO Operation Deny Flight command chain, although many
      other nations participated, including the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Spain, Germany, and Turkey.
      1.19.2. Over the first 18 months of Operation Deny Flight, the operation‘s mission expanded and its aircraft engaged
      UN resolution violators. On 28 February 1994, NATO aircraft scored the first aerial combat victories in its 45-year
      history. Two U.S. Air Force F-16s from the 526th Fighter Squadron intercepted six Bosnian Serb jets and shot down
      four.
30                                                                                    1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
      1.19.3. Despite its actions, Operation Deny Flight did not stop the Bosnian Serb attacks or effectively limit the war.
      Bosnian Serbs often took members of lightly armed UN forces hostage to compel NATO to discontinue its airstrikes.
      In May 1995, Operation Deny Flight aircraft struck a munitions depot, after which Bosnian Serbs took 370 UN
      soldiers hostage. The UN vetoed further strikes. In June, Bosnian Serbs shot down a U.S. Air Force F-16 patrolling
      over Bosnia.
      1.19.4. Operation Deliberate Force served notice to Bosnian Serb forces that they would be held accountable for their
      actions. Airstrikes came not only against targets around Sarajevo, but also against Bosnian Serb targets throughout the
      country. The results were dramatic. Operation Deliberate Force marked the first campaign in aerial warfare where
      precision munitions outweighed conventional bombs. The incessant air campaign, with only a few days respite in early
      September, as well as ground advances by Croatian and other forces against the Serbs, garnered the desired results. On
      14 September, the Serbs agreed to NATO terms and the bombing stopped.
      1.19.5. Operation Deliberate Force officially ended 21 September 1995 with the December signing in Paris of peace
      accords among the warring parties. Operation Joint Endeavor, whose mission was to implement the agreements,
      replaced it in 1996.
1.20. Operation Allied Force, Kosovo (1999):
      1.20.1. The conclusion of Operations Deliberate Force and Deny Flight did not mean the end to strife in the region.
      After revoking the province of Kosovo‘s autonomy in 1989, the Serbian government slowly began to oppress its ethnic
      Albanian population. That oppression eventually turned to violence and mass killings, and the international
      community began to negotiate with Serbian leaders in the spring of 1998 for a solution acceptable to all parties. The
      Serbs, led by President Slobodan Milosevic, considered the matter an internal one. A final effort to negotiate a
      settlement began in January 1999 at Rambouillet, France, but talks broke down following a large offensive against
      Albanian civilians in March.
      1.20.2. To prevent a repeat of the ―ethnic cleansing‖ that took place in Bosnia, on 24 March 1999 NATO forces began
      flying operations to force Serbia to accept NATO terms to end the conflict in Kosovo. Named Operation Allied Force,
      NATO leaders hoped a few days of airstrikes to demonstrate NATO‘s resolve would force Milosevic to capitulate.
      That was not the case. It took 78 days and more than 38,000 sorties for NATO to secure its objective.
      1.20.3. The primary factor in the conclusion of Operation Allied Force was NATO‘s unity and resolve. NATO was
      tough and became progressively tougher throughout the campaign. This lesson was clear to Milosevic, who had hoped
      he could outwait NATO. In addition, the precision and the persistence of the air campaign were fundamental factors in
      convincing Milosevic that it was time to end the fight. The air campaign started slowly but gathered momentum as it
      went on. It became increasingly damaging to Milosevic‘s entire military infrastructure, not just the forces in the field
      in Kosovo, but throughout the entire country.
1.21. Operations Noble Eagle and Enduring Freedom:
      1.21.1. Four unprecedented acts of violence in three locations spreading from New York City to western Pennsylvania
      to Washington DC on 11 September 2001 left thousands dead, thousands more grieving, and a nation wondering what
      would happen next. This fanatical hatred carried out by a hidden handful manifested and exploded, causing two of the
      world‘s tallest buildings to crumble, scarring the nation‘s military nerve center, and forcing the President of the United
      States aboard Air Force One to seek safe haven. Following the attacks on the World Trade Center, the Air Force
      community realized the depth and scope of the hatred. In the days that followed, stories circulated of service members
      and civilians pulling comrades from burning buildings, fighting fires, providing medical attention, and volunteering to
      do whatever they could.
      1.21.2. The Air Force responded quickly to the attack. The day of the attack, American fighter aircraft began combat
      air patrols in the skies of America in support of Operation Noble Eagle. Six months later, North American Aerospace
      Defense Command (NORAD), with more than 100 ANG, AFR, and active duty fighters from 26 locations, continued
      to monitor American airspace. More than 80 percent of the pilots flying Operation Noble Eagle missions belonged to
      the ANG. Nearly as many AFR, ANG, and active duty members (more than 11,000) deployed to support Operation
      Noble Eagle (Figure 1.10) as for the other thrust of the U.S. response to the attack, Operation Enduring Freedom.

                                                              Afghanistan, an impoverished country where the U.S. focus
                                                              was twofold: provide humanitarian airlift to the oppressed
                                                              people of Afghanistan and conduct military action to root out
                                                              terrorists and their supporters. When the Taliban,
                                                              Afghanistan‘s ruling government, refused President George W.
                                                              Bush‘s demand that suspected terrorists be turned over and all
                                                              terrorist training camps closed, the President ordered U.S.
                                                              forces to the region. Approximately 350 U.S. aircraft,
                                                              including B-1 and B-52 bombers, F-15 and F-16 fighters,
                                                              special operations aircraft, RQ-1B and RQ-4A unmanned
                                                              aerial vehicles, and Navy fighters, deployed to bases near
                                                              Afghanistan, including some in the former Soviet Union. On 7
                                                              October 2001, following continued Taliban refusal to hand
                                                              over suspected terrorists, U.S., British, and French aircraft
                                                              began a sustained campaign against terrorist targets in
                                                              Afghanistan.
      1.21.4. Working closely with U.S. special operations troops and Afghan opposition forces, airpower employed
      precision weapons to break the Taliban‘s will and capacity to resist. Organized resistance began to collapse in mid-
      November, and the Taliban abandoned the last major town under its control, Kandahar, in December 2001. In addition
      to strike operations, the Air Force flew humanitarian relief, dropping nearly 2.5 million humanitarian rations.
1.22. Operation Anaconda.
      The Pentagon called it Operation Anaconda, the press referred to it as the battle at Shah-I-Kot Mountain, but the men
      who fought there called it the Battle of Robert‘s Ridge. In the early morning hours of 4 March 2002, on a mountaintop
      called Takur Ghar in southeastern Afghanistan, al Qaeda soldiers fired on an MH-47E helicopter causing a Navy sea,
      air and land (SEAL) member to fall to the ground, and a chain of events ensued culminating in one of the most intense
      small-unit firefights of the war against terrorism, the death of all the al Qaeda terrorists defending the mountaintop,
      and the death of seven U.S. servicemen. Despite those losses, U.S. forces involved in this fight distinguished
      themselves by conspicuous bravery. Their countless acts of heroism demonstrated the best of America‘s special
      operations forces as Air Force, Army, and Navy special operators fought side by side to save one of their own and
      each other, and in the process secured the mountaintop and inflicted serious losses on al Qaeda.

                                                                   the Airmen.
      1.23.1. Much like the Gulf War, Operation Iraqi Freedom
      did not surprise anyone except Saddam Hussein. On 17
      March 2003, President George W. Bush (Figure 1.11)
      gave Saddam and his sons a 48-hour ultimatum to leave
      Iraq or face conflict. Saddam rejected President Bush‘s
      option to flee. On 20 March a salvo of missiles and laser-
      guided bombs hit targets where coalition forces believed
      Saddam and his sons and other leaders gathered. The war
      began.
      1.23.2. More than 300,000 troops deployed to the Gulf to
      form a coalition of multinational troops. Combat
      operations took longer than the 24-hour war of Operation
      Desert Storm. Operation Iraqi Freedom officially began
      20 March 2003 and ended 1 May 2003. The Pentagon
      unleashed air strikes so devastating they would leave
      Saddam‘s soldiers unable or unwilling to fight. The first
      day, coalition forces fired between 300 and 400 cruise
      missiles; more than the number launched during the
      entire first Gulf War. On the second day, the
      plan called for another 300 to 400 missiles. The battle plan was based on a concept developed at the National Defense
      University. Called ―Shock and Awe,‖ it focused on the psychological destruction of the enemy‘s will to fight rather
      than the physical destruction of the opposing military force.

      1.23.3. Heavy sand storms slowed the coalition advance, but soldiers were within 50 miles of Baghdad by 24 March.
      Missile attacks hit military facilities in Baghdad on 30 March, and by 2 April, the Iraq Republican Guard Baghdad and
      Medina divisions were defeated. U.S. soldiers seized bridges over the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and then advanced
      within 25 miles of Baghdad. The next day, U.S. Army units along with Air Force special tactics combat controllers,
      pararescuemen, and combat weathermen attacked Saddam International Airport, 10 miles southwest of the capital.
      Two days later American-armored vehicles drove through Baghdad after smashing through Republican Guard units.
      On 7 April, U.S. tanks rumbled through downtown Baghdad and a B-1B bomber attack hit buildings thought to hold
      Saddam and other leaders. On 8 April 2003, Staff Sergeant Scott Sather, a combat controller, was the first Airman
      killed in Operation Iraqi Freedom. The 29-year-old Michigan native earned seven medals, including the bronze star,
      during his Air Force career.
      1.23.4. Meanwhile, British forces took Basra, control of which was essential to delivering humanitarian aid. American
      commanders declared Saddam‘s regime was no longer in control of Baghdad on 9 April. Before the city fell, jubilant
      crowds toppled a 40-foot statue of Saddam. Iraq‘s science advisor surrendered to U.S. forces, the first on the 55 most-
      wanted leaders list issued by the coalition.
      1.23.5. In a speech delivered on 2 May 2003 aboard the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, President Bush
      announced victory in Iraq. The President‘s announcement was based on an assessment given to him 3 days earlier by
      General Tommy Franks, the top U.S. military commander in the Gulf. Meanwhile, in a speech delivered by Secretary
      of the Air Force James G. Roche on 25 April 2003 to attendees of the Command Chief Master Sergeant Conference in
      Gunter Annex, Maxwell AFB AL, Secretary Roche assessed how U.S. combat air forces performed during Operation
      Iraqi Freedom. Secretary Roche mentioned that in the past month in Iraq, coalition forces liberated an oppressed
      people and began the process of rebuilding a very different tribal and political climate.
1.24. Iraq and Afghanistan.
      1.24.1. Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan began after the attacks of September 11, 2001. Small, highly-
      mobile Army, Navy and US Air Force special operation forces were inserted deep into the hostile mountains of
      Afghanistan to find, capture, and destroy elusive Taliban and Al Qaeda forces. US Air Force enlisted personnel
      played key roles in the attempt to drive the Taliban out and they were quickly removed from power. But that wasn‘t
      the end of the conflict. Air Force Airmen continued searching for terrorists hiding in the mountains.
      1.24.2. USAF Airmen remained an essential part of US military operations worldwide as Operation Enduring Freedom
      continued. They established forward assault landing strips, directed close air support strikes, and recovered downed
      and wounded personnel. In Iraq, USAF Airmen, in joint operations with other US unconventional forces, and
      conducted missions that paralyzed 11 Iraqi divisions making the land drive to Baghdad less difficult.

                                                     1.24.3. On July 19, 2003, TSgt Kevin Whalen, a Tactical Air Control
                                                     Party Terminal Attack Controller (Figure 1.12), was supporting an
                                                     Afghan Military Forces and US Special Forces combat patrol in the
                                                     Gayan Valley, Afghanistan. The patrol was hit in a well-coordinated
                                                     ambush by a numerically superior enemy force. Whalen returned
                                                     effective fire with an automatic grenade launcher and remained
                                                     exposed to enemy fire from three directions while the rest of the team
                                                     took cover. The grenade launcher was hit six times, but Whalen
                                                     remained at his post. While he was trying to fix the launcher, Whalen
                                                     was hit three times: one bullet hit his body armor, another his Gerber
                                                     tool and the third struck him in the left arm. Whalen dropped out of the
                                                     turret and began first aid to stop the bleeding. At the same time, he
                                                     recovered his radio and calmly called in close air support. When the
                                                     engagement was over, Whalen insisted that all other wounded be
                                                     evacuated first so he could keep control of the close air support. After
      two days in the hospital, he refused to stay and went back to the team to continue combat missions. For his actions,
      TSgt Whalen was awarded the Silver Star.
      1.24.4. The bombing of the Khobar Towers on 25 June, 1996 drove major changes in how we conduct Basic Military
      Training. Since that time, the USAF has placed a strong emphasis on the preparation of our young airmen for combat.
      While the intense training has become longer it also has shifted to include a deployment phase. In 2005 this
      deployment phase, was called the BEAST. It places the trainees in an environment similar to those they may
      experience once they deploy. In addition to tackling the BEAST, and the massive obstacle courses, other training
AFPAM36-2241     1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                           33

    includes defending and protecting their base of operations, directing search and recovery, basic self aid and buddy
    care, they begin leadership training. As deployments continue our airmen are much more prepared in 2012 as a result
    of lessons learned at Khobar Towers.
    1.24.5. SMSgt Ramon Colon-Lopez, a pararescueman deployed to Afghanistan           Figure 1.13. SMSgt Colon-Lopez
    on March 11, 2004 (Figure 1.13). He was part of an advanced force operations
    team and along with elements of the Afghan national strike unit to capture a
    high-value target—a drug king-pin who was funding terrorism—and to
    prevent the proliferation of chemical weapons. Colon-Lopez was on an
    operation in Afghanistan Colon-Lopez was on the first of four helicopters,
    which took sustained small-arms fire and was seriously damaged as it landed.
    With rounds impacting all around him and unsure of the size of the enemy
    force, he pressed forward, overrunning enemy positions.            His action
    suppressed enemy fire against the other three helicopters. Colon-Lopez and
    the team drove the enemy away. The raid resulted in two enemy kills, 10
    enemy apprehensions and the destruction of rocket-propelled grenades and
    small caliber weapons. As a result of this action he became one of the first six
    recipients of the Combat Action medal. Additionally he received the Bronze
    Star with Valor for his actions during the engagement.
    1.24.6. Because of budget constraints the USAF reduced size of the active-
    duty force in 2007, to roughly 64% of that of the USAF at the end of the Gulf
    War in 1991. In 2008 the USAF went from 360,000 active duty personnel to 330,000 personnel. Consequently crews
    flying training hours were also reduced.
    Figure 1.14. SSgt Ryan Wallace
                                               1.24.7. In late January 2007, Two US Army Special Forces teams that
                                               included USAF Combat Controllers TSgt Bryan Patton and SSgt David
                                               Orvosh responded to help Iraqi police in Najaf who tried to arrest what they
                                               thought were only 30 members of the fanatical ―Soldiers of Heaven‖ sect.
                                               Instead they were ambushed by about 800 heavily-entrenched insurgents. A
                                               large battle ensued and Patton and Orvosh successfully brought in close air
                                               support that strafed and bombed the enemy. More help arrived and was
                                               quickly pinned down, which included Combat Controller SSgt Ryan
                                               Wallace (Figure 1.14). Thanks to Wallace and several others their actions
                                               would turn the tide of the battle. At a key time in the battle Wallace called
                                               in a 500-lb laser-guided bomb against the enemy position 100 meters away
                                               (―danger close‖). It killed or stunned the 40 insurgents in the position.
                                               Then, at great risk to their lives Wallace and two others charged the position
                                               and killed the remaining enemy. About 370 insurgents were killed, mostly
                                               by air attack, and more than 400 were captured (including 14 high-value
                                               targets). The destruction of this strongpoint proved to be the turning point
                                               in the battle. The three Combat Controllers‘ actions were essential to
                                               victory in this battle.
    1.24.8. On 24 October 2008 the USAF established the nuclear-focused Air Force Global Strike Command. The USAF
    wanted to put more emphasis on nuclear assets. This was a result of two incidents involving mishandling of nuclear
    weapons. On 5 June 2008, both the Secretary of the Air Force, Michael Wynne, and the Chief of Staff of the United
    States Air Force, Gen. T. Michael Moseley resigned. This was driven by the two nuclear incidents and the declining
    Air Force nuclear mission focus and performance.
    1.24.9. The withdrawal of American military forces from Iraq has been a contentious issue within the United States
    since the beginning of the Iraq War. As the war has progressed from its initial 2003 invasion phase to a multi-year
    occupation, U.S. public opinion has turned in favor of troop withdrawal. In late April 2007, the U.S. Congress passed a
    supplementary spending bill for Iraq that set a deadline for troop withdrawal, but President Bush vetoed this bill soon
    afterwards. All US Forces were mandated to withdraw from Iraqi territory by 31 December 2011 under the terms of a
    bilateral agreement signed in 2008 by President Bush. The U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq was completed on 18
    December 2011 early Sunday morning.
    1.24.10. The War in Afghanistan began on October 7, 2001, as the armed forces of the United States, the United
    Kingdom, Australia, and the Afghan United Front (Northern Alliance) launched Operation Enduring Freedom. The
34                                                                                 1 OCTOBER 2013           AFPAM36-2241
      primary driver of the invasion was the September 11 attacks on the United States, with the stated goal of dismantling
      the al-Qaeda terrorist organization and ending its use of Afghanistan as a base. The United States also said that it
      would remove the Taliban regime from power and create a viable democratic state. More than a decade into the war,
      NATO forces continue to battle a widespread Taliban insurgency, and the war has expanded into the tribal area of
      neighboring Pakistan. The War in Afghanistan is also the United States' longest running war.
      1.24.11. On May 21, 2012 the leaders of the NATO-member countries signed off on President Barack Obama's exit
      strategy from Afghanistan that calls for an end to combat operations next year and the withdrawal of the U.S.-led
      international military force by the end of 2014.
      1.24.12. Since the beginning of wartime operations in Iraq         Figure 1.15. Civil Engineering EOD Airmen

      From the skies over the Rio Grande to those over Iraq and
      Afghanistan nearly 100 years later, air power has evolved from an ineffective oddity to the dominant form of military
      might in the world. Its applications and effectiveness have increased with each succeeding conflict; in WWI air power
      played a minor role, in Kosovo it played the only role. This chapter looked at the development of air power through
      the nation‘s many conflicts and just a few of the many contributions of enlisted personnel.

2.1. Introduction.
      The Statue of Liberty stands atop Fort Wood on Liberty Island in New York Harbor. In June 1907, this piece of land
      was still called Bedloes Island, and Fort Wood was an active military installation. Corporal (Cpl) Edward Ward, a
      former railroad signal man assigned to the US Army Signal Corps post on the island, was told by his commanding
      officer that he and Private Joseph E. Barrett were going to learn how to repair and inflate balloons (Figure 2.1). Thus
      began the journey. From a fragile and uncertain curiosity a century ago, the airplane has evolved into the most
      devastating weapon system in the history of humankind. Figure 2.2 outlines the United States Air Force development
      from the Army Aeronautical Division to the U.S. Air Force. This chapter examines many of the enlisted pioneers,
      heroes, and just plain ordinary Airmen who helped form the long and varied heritage of the U.S. Air Force Enlisted
      Corps.

                                                                therefore, its disestablishment also required an act of Congress,
                                                                which did not take place until 1947. Therefore, personnel of the

2.2. Before the Airplane—Military Ballooning:
      2.2.1. On 31 July 1861, John La Mountain rose to 1,400 feet and, commanding a view 30 miles in radius, informed
      Major General Benjamin Butler that Confederate strength around Hampton, Virginia, was weaker than originally
      thought. It was La Mountain, a freelance civilian, who recorded the first successful and useful balloon reconnaissance
      mission for the Army.
             2.2.1.1. While La Mountain was enjoying initial success, Thaddeus Lowe, an old rival, entered the balloon
             service. President Abraham Lincoln interviewed Lowe, and the War Department provided Lowe $250 for
             balloon demonstrations, including the transmission of a telegraph message from aloft. In August 1861, a
             Confederate battery fired upon Lowe and his craft. Lowe and the craft escaped unharmed and went on to
             demonstrate how a balloon could effectively direct artillery fire by telegraph.
             2.2.1.2. In 1896, William Ivy Baldwin and his wife built a 14,000 cubic foot silk balloon. Baldwin enlisted in
             1897 and was tasked to ready the balloon for Signal Corps service. The balloon Santiago was used during the
             Spanish-American War at the battle of San Juan Hill. Some historians believe that the use of the balloon was a
             determining factor in the victory of this critical battle.

      2.2.2. To the extent that the U.S. military was interested in aviation, it was interested in balloons, and a balloon
      detachment of some kind was part of the U.S. Army since the Civil War (Figure 2.3).
            2.2.2.1. Public enthusiasm for all things aeronautical increased after the Wright brothers flew their heavier-than-
            air contraption at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, in 1903. A few years later, the Army purchased new balloons
            after Lieutenant Frank P. Lahm and Major Henry P. Hersey competed in the first international balloon race
            from Paris, France, to Flying Dales, England, winning the 1906 Gordon Bennett trophy and sparking renewed
            national interest in aeronautics.
Figure 2.3. Learning the Balloon Trade.                        2.2.2.2. With the army in possession of several balloons, it
                                                               required trained enlisted men to conduct balloon inflations
                                                               and effect necessary repairs. Effective 2 July 1907, Ward and
                                                               Barrett left the island under orders from the War Department
                                                               to report to the Leo Stevens balloon factory in New York
                                                               City. They would become the first enlisted men assigned to
                                                               the Signal Corps Small Aeronautical Division, which in time
                                                               evolved into the United States Air Force.

                                                               matters pertaining to military ballooning, air machines, and
                                                               all kindred subjects.‖ Captain Charles Chandler headed the
                                                               new division, assisted by Ward and Barrett. Ward and Barrett
                                                               were initially trained in the fundamentals of balloon fabric,
                                                               manufacture of buoyant gases, and inflation and control of
                                                               balloons. The enlisted detachment grew to include eight
                                                               others, including Private First Class Vernon Burge, who
                                                               would, in 1912, become the Army‘s first enlisted pilot.
                                                               2.3.2. In August 1908, Ward, Burge, and the others were at
                                                               Fort Myer when the Wright brothers arrived with the U.S.
                                                               Army‘s first airplane. That the U.S. government managed to
                                                               purchase an airplane seemed a minor miracle. For more than
                                                               4 years after the Wright brothers‘ successful flight at Kitty
                                                               Hawk, NC, the government refused to accept the fact that
                                                               man had flown in a heavier-than-air machine.
                                                              2.3.3. The new airplane—designated as Aeroplane No. 1 by
                                                              the Army—was repaired and flown a number of times over
                                                              the next few weeks. While the Wright brothers themselves,
                                                              along with their own civilian mechanics, tinkered with the
      airplane during the trial and training period, Ward and his crew mostly worked on Dirigible No. 1 (the first Army
      dirigible). On 17 September 1908, Orville Wright and Lieutenant Thomas E. Selfridge crashed. Orville was badly hurt
      and Selfridge died. Flying was suspended until the plane could be repaired and Orville could recover. It was not until
      the summer of 1909 that aircraft testing resumed. The Signal Corps formally accepted Aeroplane No. 1 on 2 August
      1909.
      2.3.4. In the fall of 1909, Lieutenant Benjamin D. Foulois was in charge of the one airplane when part of the division
      was transferred to Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio, TX. The United States ―air force‖ that arrived at San Antonio in
      February 1910, according to Foulois, consisted of one beat-up and much-patched airplane; a partially trained pilot who
      had never taken off, landed, or soloed; a civilian aircraft mechanic; and 10 budding enlisted mechanics. Foulois taught
      himself to fly at Fort Sam Houston; the results of his rough landings and crashes often put the airplane in the shop for
      weeks at a time. Lack of adequate funding often compelled Foulois to spend his own salary to keep the Aeronautical
      Division‘s lone plane aloft. A dedicated contingent of enlisted mechanics supported Foulois in his efforts. In one
      instance, Privates Glenn Madole and Vernon Burge, along with a civilian mechanic, built a wheeled landing system to
      ease takeoff and relieve the strain of landing on the fragile aircraft.
      2.3.5. Increased appropriations allowed the Army to purchase more aircraft. By October 1912, the Aeronautical
      Division had 11 aircraft, 14 flying officers, and 39 enlisted mechanics. On 28 September 1912, one of these
      mechanics, Corporal Frank Scott, became the first enlisted person to die in an accident in a military aircraft. A crew

      chief, Scott was flying as a passenger when the aircraft‘s pilot lost control and crashed. Scott Field, now Scott Air
      Force Base (AFB) IL, was named in his honor. On 5 March 1913, the 1st Aero Squadron (Provisional) was activated.
2.4. Aviation Section, U.S. Army Signal Corps (1914-1918):
      2.4.1. After years of testing, improvising, and operating on little more than dedication and a shoestring, Army aviation
      finally received official status with the 18 July 1914 passage of U.S. House Resolution 5304, which authorized the
      Signal Corps to establish an aviation section consisting of 60 officers and 260 enlisted men. The bill created the
      military rating of aviation mechanician, which called for a 50 percent pay increase for enlisted men ―instructed in the
      art of flying‖ while they were on flying status. The number of such personnel was limited to 40, and the law specified
      that no more than a dozen enlisted men could be trained as aviators.
      2.4.2. In March 1916, President Woodrow Wilson ordered the 1st Aero Squadron (the oldest Air Force squadron) to
      accompany a force he was organizing to protect the border and to apprehend Pancho Villa (Figure 2.4). Mustering 11
      pilot officers, 82 enlisted men, and 1 civilian mechanic, the squadron departed from San Antonio with 8 Curtiss JN-3
      ―Jennies,‖ 10 trucks, and 6 motorcycles. On the train, Foulois picked up a pair of enlisted hospital corpsmen, and an
      engineering section officer and 14 enlisted men joined them. In spite of the 1st Aero Squadron‘s reconnaissance flights
      and several deliveries of mail and dispatches, it was readily apparent the squadron‘s JN-type aeroplane was not
      powerful enough to operate at the Casa Grande 5,000-foot elevation. By 19 April, only two of the planes were in
      working condition. The rest had fallen victim to accidents and forced landings, and all had suffered from the heat and
      sand.
      2.4.3. After 11 months of fruitless campaigning, the so- Figure 2.4. Enlisted Fighting Off Pancho Villa’s Men.
      called Punitive Expedition was recalled in February
      1917, and Villa continued to lead rebels in northern
      Mexico until 1920. Yet, poorly equipped as it was, the
      1st Aero Squadron had acquitted itself admirably.
      Although the poor climbing characteristics of the
      aircraft did not permit the pilots to carry sufficient food
      or adequate clothing, on his final report of the mission,
      Major Foulois praised his pilots and commended them
      on their willingness to fly clearly dangerous aircraft. He
      did not neglect the enlisted personnel, praising praised
      them for dedication and willingness to work day and
      night to keep the aircraft flying. The results of this first
      demonstration of American airpower were deeply
      disappointing, but Foulois and the others learned
      valuable lessons about the realities of aviation under
      field conditions. Adequate maintenance was essential,
      as were plenty of backup aircraft, which could be
      rotated into service while other airplanes were removed
      from the line and repaired. Enlisted and civilian mechanics faced countless problems, such as when the laminated
      wood propellers pulled apart. In response, mechanics developed a humidor facility to maximize prop life.
2.5. World War I (WWI) (1917-1918):
      2.5.1. As early as 1915, Americans flew in the European war with both the French and the British, though it was the
      American-manned Lafayette Escadrille of France that earned the greatest and most enduring fame. A little-
      acknowledged fact about the much-celebrated Lafayette Escadrille is that its roster of aviators included an enlisted
      man who was also an African-American; one of very few enlisted Americans to fly during the war and the only black
      man of any nationality to serve as a pilot. Corporal Eugene Bullard (Figure 2.5) was the son of a Georgia former slave.
      As a member of the French Foreign Legion, he earned the Croix de Guerre (one of 15 decorations from the French
      government) and was wounded 4 times before the legion gave him a disability discharge.

Figure 2.5. Eugene Bullard.
                                 During his convalescence in Paris, he bet an American $2,000 that
                                 he could learn to fly and become a combat aviator. Corporal Bullard
                                 won the bet by completing training and joining the Lafayette Escadrille.
                                 Styling himself the ―Black Swallow of Death,‖ he claimed two
                                 victories. Despite his record of daring and dedication, he was grounded
                                 at the request of American officers attached to the escadrille. When the
                                 escadrille pilots were reorganized and incorporated into the American
                                 Expeditionary Force (AEF), Bullard was denied the commission
                                 accorded to other escadrille aviators and to most of the handful of white
                                 enlisted men who had earned their wings in regular U.S. Army outfits.
                                 2.5.2. Enlisted personnel also served as observers for the aircraft and
                                 balloon corps. It was in this capacity that Sergeant Fred C. Graveline
                                 (Figure 2.6) of the 20th Aero Squadron received the Distinguished
                                 Service Cross. He was one of only four enlisted personnel so honored.
                                 Graveline was an observer and aerial gunner in the back seat of a DH-4
                                 for 15 missions from 30 September to 5 November 1918. During one
                                 35-minute battle, in which Graveline remarked he ―aged 10 years,‖ he
                                 helped drive off nearly two dozen German planes, shooting down two.
                                 2.6. Division of Military Aeronautics and the Air Service (1918-
                                 1926):
                                 2.6.1. Despite air service successes, the Navy remained unconvinced
                                 that it was vulnerable from the air. Officials eventually turned over two
                                 WWI battleships—the USS New Jersey (BB-16) and the USS
                                 Virginia—for further testing. A young bombardier, Sergeant Ulysses
                                 ―Sam‖ Nero (Figure 2.7), earned a slot among the 12 aircrews selected
                                 by General Mitchell to try to sink the battleships.

      2.6.2. On 5 September 1923, 11 aircraft reached the targets just off the North Carolina coast (the 12th returned to base
      because of engine trouble). Ten of the aircraft dropped their ordnance far from the New Jersey. Nero, using different
      tactics than General Mitchell instructed, scored two hits. General Mitchell disqualified Nero and his pilot from further
      competition. But General Mitchell reconsidered when the remainder of the crews failed to hit the Virginia until they
      dropped down to 1,500 feet.
      2.6.3. Nero and the Martin-Curtiss NBS-1 pilot approached the New Jersey at 85 miles per hour at an altitude of 6,900
      feet, from about 15 degrees off the port beam. Using an open wire site, Nero dropped his first 600-pound bomb right
      down the ship‘s smokestack. A delayed explosion lent suspense to the result, but a billowing black cloud signaled the
      New Jersey‘s demise, which went down in just over 3 minutes. Having one bomb left and no New Jersey to drop it on,
      Nero‘s aircraft proceeded to the floundering Virginia, where Nero proceeded to administer the coup degrace on the
      stricken craft—his bomb landed directly on the Virginia‘s deck. General Mitchell promoted Nero during the next
      cycle.
      2.6.4. By the end of WWI, the Navy and the Army planned to experiment with bombing enemy ships from the air.
      General Mitchell contended his airplanes could take on the Navy‘s battleships and challenged the Navy to a test. On
      13 July 1921, Mitchell directed an attack on a former German destroyer. The air service sank the vessel after two
      direct hits. Five days later, the air service sank a German cruiser, and 21 July 1921, aircrews dropped 2,000-pound
      bombs, sinking the German battleship Ostfriesland.

                                                                   ―around the rim‖ of the country, starting at Bolling Field
                                                                   24 July 1919 (Figure 2.8). Totaling 100 flights and 9,823
                                                                   miles, Dobias kept the effort from ending before it began.
                                                                   Almost immediately after taking off from Bolling, he
                                                                   crawled out on the aircraft‘s left wing without a

                                                                   flew a round-trip flight of four DH-4Bs from Mitchell
                                                                   Field on Long Island to Nome, Alaska. The flight took 3
                                                                   months and covered 9,000 miles. Its safety record was
                                                                   largely attributable to Master Sergeant Albert Vierra. In

      Enlisted men participated in a range of experimental
      work, including altitude flights, blind flying, aerial
      photography, cosmic ray research, and the development
      of the parachute. Whether they were selected or
      volunteered, enlisted men were the first to try out new
      parachute designs, and they eventually took over most of
      the testing and training. The most prominent enlisted
      parachutist was Sergeant Ralph Bottriell (Figure 2.9),
      who tested the first backpack-style, freefall parachute 19
      May 1919. Bottriell eventually became chief parachute
      instructor at Kelly Field TX and earned the Distinguished
      Flying Cross in 1933 for service as an experimental
      parachute tester.
2.8. World War II (WWII) (1939-1945):
      2.8.1. Not many fliers have had a popular song written
      about them, but an exception was a soft-spoken
      (USAAF) enlisted man, John D. Foley (Figure 2.10).
      Although he never received aerial gunnery training, he

Figure 2.10. John D. Foley.                           volunteered as a gunner and was assigned to a B-26 crew. On his first
                                                      mission, Foley shot down at least one Japanese enemy aircraft. Other
                                                      19th Bomb Squadron members confirmed his victory and he was
                                                      nicknamed ―Johnny Zero‖ by a war correspondent. Corporal Foley
                                                      became a hero and the subject of a popular song, ―Johnny Got a
                                                      Zero.‖ Commercial firms capitalized on his fame and produced such
                                                      items as ―Johnny Zero‖ watches and boots. During his 31 other
                                                      Pacific combat missions, Foley shared in the destruction of at least 6
                                                      more enemy aircraft and survived 3 crashes. Malaria forced his return
                                                      to the United States in 1943 where he toured factories promoting war
                                                      production. He volunteered to fly again and completed 31 missions
                                                      over Europe. He returned to the United States and was preparing for a
                                                      third overseas tour when WWII ended. Before the war ended, Foley
                                                      became an Army Air Force legend, decorated eight times for heroism,
                                                      and personally recognized by Generals MacArthur, Eisenhower, and
                                                      Doolittle.
                                                                           Figure 2.11. Paul Airey.

2.8.2. At the age of 20, on a mission to bomb the oil refineries outside
Vienna, Technical Sergeant Paul Airey (Figure 2.11) and his fellow
crewmen were shot down on their 28th mission. He was a prisoner of
war (POW) for 10 months, surviving a 90-day march from the Baltic
Sea to Berlin, before being liberated by the British Army in 1945.
Promoted to Chief Master Sergeant in 1962, Airey became the first
Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force in 1967. In 1988, he received
the first Air Force POW medal.
2.8.3. Before 1942, the Army‘s air wing had barred blacks from service
and only began accepting black officers and enlisted men when forced
by Congress and the wartime emergency. Blacks during WWII were
admitted to the Army Air Forces on a strictly segregated basis. Training
and service for black enlisted members and officers were mostly
confined to a single, separate base at Tuskegee, Alabama. All-black
combat fighter units formed the famous ―Tuskegee Airmen‖ with
enlisted black mechanics and support troops (Figure 2.12).

Figure 2.13. Esther Blake.                      2.8.4. Esther Blake was the ―first woman in the Air Force‖ (Figure 2.13).
                                                She enlisted on the first minute of the first hour of the first day regular Air
                                                Force duty was authorized for women—8 July 1948. Blake‘s active military
                                                career began in 1944 when she, a widow, joined her sons in the Army Air
                                                Forces. She closed her desk as a civilian employee at Miami Air Depot and
                                                joined the WAC when she was notified that her oldest son, a B-17 pilot, had
                                                been shot down over Belgium and was reported missing. Her younger son
                                                said that the reason she joined was the hope of helping free a soldier from
                                                clerical work to fight, thus speeding the end of the war. During the months
                                                and years that followed, Blake saw both of her sons return home from combat
                                                with only minor wounds and many decorations. She remained in the Air
                                                Force until 1954 when she separated due to disability. After separation, she
                                                worked as a civil service employee at the Veterans Regional Headquarters in
                                                Montgomery AL until her death in 1979.
                                              2.8.5. The 25th Liaison Squadron was one of the more celebrated liaison
                                              units. One of its members, Staff Sergeant James Nichols, earned the Air
                                              Medal and Silver Star for separate exploits in early 1944. For the Air Medal,
                                              Nichols landed his L-5 on an empty beach where earlier in the day he had
                                              noticed the words ―U.S. Ranger‖ scrawled in the sand. Twenty rangers,
                                              several of whom were seriously wounded, were trapped behind enemy lines
                                              for weeks and were running low on ammunition and supplies. Two at a time,
                                              Nichols and accompanying L-5s picked up the soldiers and whisked them to
                                              safety. Nichols earned the Silver Star for his role in the rescue of a P-40 pilot
      in New Guinea. Nichols landed his L-5 on a rough strip in an effort to pick up the pilot and two other former rescuers.
      One of the former rescuers crashed his L-5 a week before in an attempt to rescue the pilot. Unfortunately, Nichols‘
      aircraft was also damaged beyond repair and the only remaining option was to walk out. With only a 2-day supply of
      food, the group hiked for 17 days before an Australian patrol caught up with the men. Each person had lost 25 to 30
      pounds and had contracted malaria, but all recovered.
      2.8.6. Enlisted personnel served with honor throughout WWII. For example, a raid against the last operational Nazi oil
      refinery on 15 March 1945 was successful but cost the life of one of the enlisted force‘s most decorated Airmen.
      Sergeant Sandy Sanchez flew 44 missions as a gunner with the 95th Bomb Group, 19 more than required to complete
      his tour. After returning home for a brief period, rather than accept an assignment as a gunnery instructor, he returned
      to Europe. Flying with the 353d Bombardment Squadron in Italy, Sanchez‘s aircraft was hit by ground fire. Nine crew
      members bailed out, but Sanchez never made it from the stricken aircraft. Sanchez‘s honors include the Silver Star,
      Soldier‘s Medal, and Distinguished Flying Cross.
2.9. A Separate Service (1947):
      2.9.1. Initially, the rank system remained as it had been in the USAAF. Corporal was removed from noncommissioned
      officer (NCO) status in 1950. Then, in 1952, the Air Force officially changed the names of the lower four ranks from
      private to airman basic; private first class to airman third class; corporal to airman second class; and sergeant to airman
      first class. These changes were in response to a development that surfaced during WWII. The Air Force enlisted ranks
      were packed with highly skilled technicians who sought and received NCO ranks as a reflection of their training and
      value to the service. Eventually, an abundance of sergeants, many of whom did not play the traditional lower
      management role of sergeants, permeated the Air Force. The establishment of a separate Air Force and the multiplying
      sophistication of air force hardware put emphasis on specialists who were rated as staff sergeants or technical
      sergeants.
      2.9.2. There was at first no change in appearance. The distinctive blue uniforms of the U.S. Air Force were introduced
      only after large stocks of Army clothing were used up. Familiar terms slowly gave way to new labels. By 1959,
      enlisted Airmen ate in ―dining halls‖ rather than ―mess halls,‖ were eyed warily by ―air police‖ instead of ―military
      police,‖ and bought necessities at the ―base exchange‖ instead of the ―post exchange.‖

                                                              countermeasures operators were selected to staff the 99th
                                                              Bomb Wing at Westover, MA. These personnel served until
                                                              commissioned replacements were available in late 1964. Some
                                                              even trained, checked, and certified their own replacements.
                                                              During the years between 1956 and 1964, several other
                                                              requirements led to the certification of enlisted EWOs. In all,
                                                              132 enlisted personnel were qualified and assigned duties as

      2.10.1. During the Vietnam War in the realm
      of combat operations, Air Force gunners flew
      aboard gunships as well as B-57s and B-52s. In
      December 1972, B-52 tail gunner Staff
      Sergeant Samuel Turner shot down an enemy
      MiG, the first of only two confirmed shoot-
      downs by enlisted Airmen during the war. Both
      victories were from gunners belonging to the
      307th Strategic Wing at U-Tapao, Thailand.
      Credit for the fifth overall MiG-21 kill during
      Linebacker II also went to an enlisted member,
      Airman First Class Albert E. Moore (Figure
      2.15).

                                            2.10.2. Chief Master Sergeant Wayne Fisk (Figure 2.16) was directly involved
                                            in/the famed Son Tay POW camp raid and the rescue of the crew of the USS
                                            Mayaguez. When the USS Mayaguez was hijacked by Cambodian Communist
                                            forces in May 1975, Fisk was a member of the assault force that successfully
                                            recovered the ship, the crew, and the trapped United States Marines. For his
                                            actions, Fisk earned his second Silver Star. Concluding the Mayaguez mission,
                                            he was recognized as the last American serviceman to engage Communist forces
                                            in ground combat in Southeast Asia. In 1979, he was the first Air Force enlisted
                                            recipient of the U.S. Jaycees Ten Outstanding Young Men of America. In 1986,
                                            Fisk became the first director of the Air Force Enlisted Heritage Hall on Maxwell

      2.10.3. Combat came not only in the air for Air Force enlisted members. With the continuing threat of guerilla attack
      throughout the country, air base defense became a monumental undertaking performed almost exclusively by Air
      Force security police squadrons. In one instance, Staff Sergeant William Piazza of the 3d Security Police Squadron
      earned the Silver Star (Figure 2.17) for helping defend Bien Hoa during the North Vietnamese Tet Offensive of 1968.
      2.10.4. On 18 December 1966, a flare on board an AC-47 gunship exploded prematurely, deploying its parachute in
      the aircraft. With only seconds before the 4,000-degree Fahrenheit flare ignited, Staff Sergeant Parnell Fisher of the
      4th Air Commando Squadron searched the darkened cabin and threw the flare out just as it ignited. The parachute,
      however, caught under the cargo door, and the flare burned next to the fuselage. Fisher cut the lines while leaning
      outside the aircraft, probably saving the crew and plane. These efforts earned him the Silver Star.

2.11. Post Vietnam to Present (1973-Present).
      2.11.1. On 8 April 2003, Staff Sergeant Scott Sather (Figure 2.18), a combat controller, was the first Airman killed in
      Operation Iraqi Freedom. The 29-year-old Michigan native earned seven medals, including the bronze star, during his
      Air Force career.
      2.11.2. While providing convoy security support on Wednesday, 28 September 2005, in Safwan, Iraq, 21-year old
      Airman 1st Class Elizabeth Nicole Jacobson (Figure 2.19), of Riviera Beach, Florida, became the first Security Forces
      Airman (and the first female Airman killed in the line of duty) to die in Operation Iraqi Freedom. She died as a result
      of her vehicle making contact with an improvised explosive device (IED). Airman Jacobson had been in Iraq for just
      over 3 months.

            B-17 tail gunner Smith, of Caro MI, earned the
            first Medal of Honor awarded to an enlisted man.
            Flying his first mission 1 May 1943, Smith‘s
            aircraft was one of several 306th Bomber Group
            planes assigned to attack the heavily defended
            submarine pens at St. Nazaire, France. Smith‘s
            aircraft bore the brunt of intense antiaircraft and
            enemy fighter attacks. Three crewmembers bailed
            out and two more were seriously wounded during
            the continuous attacks. While the stricken
            aircraft‘s oxygen supply system could not supply
            oxygen to the crew, it did feed the many fires
            raging on the plane. Smith grabbed fire
            extinguishers and water bottles to battle the
            flames. After exhausting these, he wrapped
            himself in extra layers of clothing to beat out the
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                                  45

            fires so intense they melted radio equipment cameras and caused ammunition to explode. While fighting the
            fires, he also administered first aid to his wounded crewmates and manned guns to fight off enemy fighter
            attacks. Secretary of War Henry Stimson presented Smith the Medal of Honor in July 1943.
      2.12.2. Technical Sergeant Forrest L. Vosler               Figure 2.22. Forrest L. Vosler.
      (Figure 2.22).
            On 20 December 1943, radio operator
            Vosler, of Lyndonville NY, became the
            second enlisted man to receive the Medal of
            Honor. During an attack against a submarine
            base at Bremen, Germany, by the 303d
            Bomber Group, the B-17 aircraft to which
            Vosler was assigned lost two engines to
            antiaircraft fire and fell out of formation,
            attracting swarms of enemy fighter aircraft.
            Early attacks wounded Vosler in the legs.
            When he worked his way to the rear of the
            aircraft to take over for the injured tail
            gunner, he sustained injuries to the chest and
            face, which impeded his vision. Vosler
            continued to fire at approaching enemy
            aircraft despite offers of first aid. Lapsing in
            and out of consciousness after the attacks
            ceased, he managed to repair the damaged
            radio by touch alone and send out a distress
            call. Virtually sightless by the time the
            crippled aircraft was forced to ditch in the
            North Sea, Vosler continued to aid the tail                 Courtesy of the Air Force Enlisted Heritage Research Institute
            gunner until they could be rescued. President
            Roosevelt presented Vosler the Medal of
            Honor in a White House ceremony in
            September 1944.

                                                               The final Medal of Honor earned by an enlisted man in the

                                                               serving as engineer and ball turret gunner, Mathies‘ aircraft was
                                                               severely damaged in a frontal attack by enemy fighters over
                                                               Leipzig, Germany. The attack killed the copilot and wounded the
                                                               pilot, rendering him unconscious. Sergeant Carl Moore, the
                                                               plane‘s top turret gunner, managed to pull the aircraft from its
                                                               spin, and he and Mathies managed to fly the aircraft back to
                                                               England. Surviving crewmembers were ordered to parachute to
                                                               safety. All but Mathies and the navigator, Lieutenant Walter

                                                               pilot. On his third attempt to land, Mathies crashed the aircraft,
                                                               killing all aboard.

      2.12.4. Staff Sergeant Henry E. Erwin (Figure 2.24).
            On 12 April 1945, Erwin of the 29th Bombardment Group earned the USAAF enlisted corps‘ final Medal of
            Honor. The 23-year old Adamsville AL native served as a radio operator aboard a B-29 attacking a chemical
            plant at Koriyama, Japan. As the aircraft began its bomb run, the flare Erwin prepared to release ignited
            prematurely and began to burn through the floor of the aircraft. Already badly injured by the flare, he cradled
            the 1,300-degree Fahrenheit flare and hurled it through the copilot‘s window. Badly burned and not expected to
            survive, Erwin received the Medal of Honor from General Curtis LeMay just over a week after the Koriyama
            mission. However, Erwin did survive the incident, as well as dozens of subsequent operations. He went on to
            serve more than 30 years in the Veterans Administration.
      2.12.5. Airman First Class John Levitow (Figure 2.25).
            On 24 February 1969, an enemy shell exploded on the right wing of ―Spooky 71,‖ an AC-47 on a night
            illumination mission near Long Binh, South Vietnam. The explosion injured all four enlisted personnel,
            including Airman First Class John Levitow. In addition, an armed Mark 24 flare rolled about the cabin floor.
            Suffering 40 shrapnel wounds, Levitow fell on the flare, dragged it to the cargo door, and heaved it outside. It
            ignited almost immediately. President Richard Nixon presented him with the Medal of Honor in a White House
            ceremony on 14 May 1970.

            The Air Force used helicopters for everything: personnel and supply
            transport; infiltration and exfiltration of special operations troops; and
            search and rescue. Pararescue personnel were among the most decorated
            individuals in the war. Some of the honors received included the Medal of
            Honor, Air Force Cross, and the Silver Star. While assigned as a
            pararescue crewmember to Detachment 6, 38th Aerospace Rescue and
            Recovery Squadron, Airman First Class William Pitsenbarger
            distinguished himself by extreme valor 11 April 1966 near Cam My,
            Republic of Vietnam. Pitsenbarger was aboard an HH-43 rescue helicopter
            responding to a call to evacuate casualties from an ongoing firefight
            between Company C, United States Army 1st Infantry Division, and a
            sizeable enemy force approximately 35 miles east of Saigon. With
            complete disregard for personal safety, Pitsenbarger volunteered to ride a
            hoist more than 100 feet through the jungle to the ground because Army
            personnel were having trouble loading casualties onto the Stokes litter. On the ground, he organized and
            coordinated rescue efforts, cared for the wounded, prepared casualties for evacuation, and ensured that the
            recovery operation continued in a smooth and orderly fashion. As each of the nine casualties evacuated that day
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                        47

            was recovered, Pitsenbarger refused evacuation in order to get more wounded soldiers to safety. After several
            pickups, Pitsenbarger‘s rescue helicopter was struck by heavy enemy ground fire and was forced to leave the
            scene for an emergency landing. Pitsenbarger waved off evacuation and voluntarily stayed behind on the ground
            to perform medical duties. Shortly thereafter, the area came under sniper and mortar fire. During the
            subsequent attempt to evacuate the site, American forces came under heavy assault by a large Viet Cong force.
            When the enemy launched an assault, the evacuation was called off, and Pitsenbarger took up arms with the
            besieged infantrymen. He courageously resisted the enemy, braving intense gunfire to gather and distribute vital
            ammunition to American defenders. As the battle raged on, he repeatedly exposed himself to enemy fire to care
            for the wounded, pull them out of the line of fire, and return fire when he could. He was wounded three times,
            and in spite of his wounds, he valiantly fought on, simultaneously treating as many wounded as possible. In the
            vicious fighting that followed, the perimeter was breached and American forces suffered 80 percent casualties,
            including Pitsenbarger. His bravery and determination stand as a prime example of the highest professional
            standards and traditions of military service. His family was initially awarded his Air Force Cross in a Pentagon
            ceremony in 1966. Thirty-four years later, after survivors of the battle came forward with proof of
            Pitsenbarger‘s valor, and with the signing of the 2001 National Defense Authorization Act, Pitsenbarger‘s Air
            Force Cross was upgraded to the Medal of Honor making him the sixth enlisted member to be awarded the
            country‘s highest award.

            On 21 September 2010, President Barack Obama awarded the
            Medal of Honor to the family of Chief Master Sergeant Richard
            L. Etchberger. On 11 March 1968, Etchberger was in Laos,
            assigned as the Ground Radar Superintendent, Detachment 1,
            1043d Radar Evaluation Squadron. Etchberger and his team of
            technicians were manning a top-secret defensive position at Lima
            Site 85 when the base was overrun by enemy ground forces.
            Under sustained, withering heavy artillery attack, many of
            Etchberger‘s crew lay dead or severely wounded. With little
            combat training, he simultaneously held off the enemy using an
            M-16 while directing airstrikes into the area and calling for air
            rescue. Because of his fierce defense and heroic and selfless
            actions, he denied the enemy access to his position and saved the
            lives of his remaining crew. With the arrival of rescue aircraft,
            Etchberger, without hesitation, repeatedly and deliberately risked
            his own life, exposing himself to heavy enemy fire, to place three
            surviving wounded comrades into rescue slings hanging from the hovering helicopter waiting to airlift them to
            safety. With remaining crew safely aboard, Etchberger finally climbed into an evacuation sling himself, only to
            be fatally wounded by enemy ground fire as he was being raised into the aircraft.
2.13. Air Force Cross Recipients.
      To date, 26 enlisted members have been awarded the Air Force Cross (Figure 2.28). Of the 20 Air Force Cross
      recipients from the Vietnam conflict, 10 were pararescuemen. Of note, Sergeant Steve Northern (1968) earned two
      Silver Stars and a Purple Heart during his tours in Vietnam. Northern was credited with 51 combat rescues—the most
      in Air Force history. Paragraph 2.13.1 through paragraph 2.13.5 highlight some of the Air Force Cross recipients.

     2.13.1. Technical Sergeant Timothy A. Wilkinson.            Figure 2.29. Timothy A. Wilkinson.
           In the late afternoon of 3 October 1993, Technical
           Sergeant Timothy A. Wilkinson (Figure 2.29), a
           pararescueman with the 24th Special Tactics
           Squadron, and his crew responded to a downed
           U.S. UH-60 helicopter in the streets of
           Mogadishu. Wilkinson repeatedly exposed
           himself to intense enemy small arms fire while
           extracting the wounded and dead crewmembers
           from the crashed helicopter. Despite his own
           wounds, he provided life-saving medical
           treatment to the wounded crewmembers. With the
           helicopter crew taken care of, he turned to aid the
           casualties of a Ranger security element engaged in
           an intense firefight across an open four-way
           intersection from his position, where he began
           immediate medical treatment. His decisive
           actions, personal courage, and bravery under
           heavy enemy fire were integral to the success of
           all casualty treatment and evacuation efforts
           conducted in the intense 18-hour combat
           engagement. Wilkinson was awarded the Air
           Force Cross for his actions.
     2.13.2. Senior Airman Jason D. Cunningham.                        Figure 2.30. Jason D. Cunningham.
           Senior Airman Jason D. Cunningham (Figure 2. 30) was
           one of seven killed in a battle fought on a mountaintop
           called Takur Ghar in southeastern Afghanistan.
           Cunningham earned the Air Force Cross, presented
           posthumously, for giving his life heroically. Despite
           mortal wounds, he saved 10 people, and made it possible
           for 7 others who were killed to come home. The citation
           accompanying the Air Force Cross reads, ―Despite
           effective enemy fire, and at great risk to his own life,
           Cunningham remained in the burning fuselage of the
           aircraft in order to treat the wounds. As he moved his
           patients to a more secure location, mortar rounds began to
           impact within 50 feet of his position. Disregarding this
           extreme danger, he continued the movement and exposed
           himself to enemy fire on seven separate occasions. When
           the second casualty collection point was also
           compromised, in a display of uncommon valor and
           gallantry, Cunningham braved an intense small arms and
           rocket-propelled grenade attack while repositioning the
           critically wounded to a third collection point. Even after
           he was mortally wounded and quickly deteriorating, he
           continued to direct patient movement and transferred care to another medic.‖ Cunningham was laid to rest in
           Arlington National Cemetery on 11 March 2002.

    2.13.3. Technical Sergeant John A. Chapman.               Figure 2.31. John A. Chapman.
         On 10 January 2003, the Secretary of the Air
         Force posthumously awarded the Air Force
         Cross to Technical Sergeant John A. Chapman
         (Figure 2.31). It was only the third time since the
         end of the Vietnam conflict that an enlisted
         Airman received the Air Force Cross, and the
         second Air Force Cross presented to one of the
         enlisted Airmen who died during the 17-hour
         ordeal atop Takur Ghar mountain, Afghanistan.
         Chapman‘s MH-47 helicopter came under enemy
         fire, causing a Navy SEAL to fall out during an
         insertion. The helicopter landed 4.5 miles away
         from where the SEAL was killed. Once on the
         ground, Chapman provided directions to another
         helicopter to pick them up. After being rescued,
         Chapman and the team volunteered to rescue
         their mission team member from the enemy
         stronghold. After landing, Chapman killed two
         enemy soldiers and, without regard for his own
         life, advanced toward a dug-in machinegun nest.
         The team came under fire from three directions.
         Chapman exchanged fire from minimum
         personal cover and succumbed to multiple
         wounds. His engagement and destruction of the first enemy position and advancement to the second enabled his
         team to move to cover and break enemy contact. He is credited with saving the lives of the entire rescue team.
    2.13.4. Senior Airman Zachary J. Rhyner.                   Figure 2.32. Zachary J. Rhyner.
         On 10 March, 2009 Senior Airman Zachary J.
         Rhyner (Figure 2.32) received the Air Force Cross
         from Secretary of the Air Force Michael B. Donely
         for extraordinary heroism in military operations on
         6 April 2008 against an armed enemy of the United
         States in a valley in Nuristan Province,
         Afghanistan. On that date, while assigned as
         Special Tactics Combat Controller, Rhyner
         executed a day rotary-wing infiltration with his
         Special Forces team to capture high-value
         insurgents in a village on the surrounding
         mountains. The team was attacked in a well-
         coordinated and deadly ambush while climbing
         near-vertical terrain to reach their objective.
         Devastating sniper, machine gun, and rocket-
         propelled grenade fire poured down on the team
         from elevated and protected positions on all sides,
         immediately pinning down the assault force.
         Without regard for his life, Rhyner placed himself
         between the most immediate threats and provided
         suppressive fire with his M-4 rifle to protect
         multiple wounded soldiers, while simultaneously
         directing close air support strikes. Rhyner bravely
         withstood the hail of enemy fire to control eight
         Air Force fighters and four Army attack
         helicopters. Despite being hit 3 times by enemy fire during the opening exchange, wounded once in the leg and
         twice in the chest, only to be protected by his equipment, he controlled more than 50 attack runs. Trapped on a
         60-foot cliff under constant enemy fire, Rhyner repeatedly repelled the enemy with "danger close‖ air strikes,
         several within 100 meters of his position, showering his team with dirt and debris. Twice, his actions prevented
         his element from being overrun during the harrowing six and a half hour battle.

            Air Force Special Tactics Combat Controller Staff
            Sergeant Robert Gutierrez, Jr. (Figure 2.33),
            received the Air Force Cross for extraordinary
            heroism during a raging firefight in Afghanistan‘s
            Herat province on 5 October 2009. On that date,
            Gutierrez and his team conducted a high-risk
            nighttime raid to capture the number two Taliban
            leader in the region. During the initial assault, the
            team was attacked with a barrage of rifle and heavy
            machine-gun fire from a numerically superior and
            determined enemy force. Gutierrez was shot in the
            chest, his team leader was shot in the leg, and the
            10-man element was pinned down in a building
            with no escape route. In great pain and confronting
            the very real possibility that he would die, Gutierrez seized the initiative and refused to relinquish his duties as
            joint terminal attack controller. Under intense fire, he engaged Taliban fighters with his M-4 rifle and brought
            airpower to bear, controlling three ―danger close‖ A-10 strafing runs with exceptional precision against enemy
            forces just 30 feet away. After the first A-10 attack, the team medic performed a needle decompression to re-
            inflate Gutierrez‘s collapsed lung, allowing him to direct the next two strafe runs which decimated the enemy
            force and allowed the team to escape the kill zone without additional casualties. Throughout the four-hour
            battle, Gutierrez‘s valorous actions, at great risk to his own life, helped save the lives of his teammates and dealt
            a crushing blow to the regional Taliban network.

Figure 2.34. Vernon Burge.                        2.14.1. In 1912, when the United States opened an aviation school at the
                                                  newly established Fort William McKinley in the Philippines, only one
                                                  officer volunteered for pilot training. A corporal (Vernon Burge [Figure
                                                  2.34]), recognizing his opportunity, stepped forward, becoming the first
                                                  enlisted man in the history of United States aviation to train as a pilot.
                                                  Over the next 30 years, 3,000 enlisted men would follow his lead. These
                                                  men—mess cooks, mechanics, and civilian pilots among them—enabled
                                                  the military to bring the number of pilots in its ranks up to combat
                                                  strength.
                                                  2.14.2. Despite the National Defense Act of 1916 authorization to train
                                                  enlisted aviators, institutional bias limited the number of enlisted pilots
                                                  before the United States entered the war. Most of those were
                                                  commissioned after the United States formally declared war on the Central
                                                  Powers.
                                                  2.14.3. Vernon Burge and the handful of WWI enlisted aviators who
                                                  immediately followed him were the first of some 3,000 enlisted personnel
                                                  who would fly between the wars and into the early months of WWII. The
                                                  military withheld official flying status from these men until Congress
                                                  enacted Public Law 99 in 1941, which provided for training enlisted
                                                  ―aviation students,‖ who were ―awarded the rating of pilot and warranted
                                                  as a staff sergeant.‖

                                                               pilot inspired to fly by watching Vernon Burge, was
                                                               commissioned in January 1917 and commanded a flight school
                                                               in Pennsylvania. However, before that, his flying skills were
                                                               invaluable to the Aviation Section. Known as the ―Father of
                                                               Blind Flight,‖ Ocker flight-tested modified aircraft, served as a

                                                               Mitchell to scout land parcels near the Potomac River to serve
                                                               as future airfields. One of the tracts he selected became Bolling
                                                               Field, Washington DC.
                                                                  2.14.5. Enlisted pilots were anomalies between the wars, as
                                                                  they tended to be during most of history. Most served as
                                                                  noncommissioned officers (NCO), but held commissions in the
                                                                  Reserves. Some could not qualify for regular Army
                                                                  commissions because they lacked the required education.
                                                                  Others took enlisted status simply because they were desperate
                                                                  to fly and there were few officer slots in the peacetime air
                                                                  service. In 1928, for example, all 42 enlisted pilots, ranging
                                                                  from corporal to master sergeant, held Reserve commissions.
                                                                  Legislation passed in 1926 specifically directed the corps to
      train enlisted pilots, and set a goal that 20 percent of all Air Corps pilots should be enlisted. From the viewpoint of air
      corps commanders, it was too expensive to train enlisted pilots because they could not be moved into officer
      administrative jobs after their active flying careers. The Great Depression complicated the situation. In 1933, blaming
      a shortage of funds, the Air Corps called a halt to enlisted pilot training.
      2.14.6. The aerobatics team ―Three Men on a                   Figure 2.36. ―Three Men on a Flying Trapeze.‖
      Flying Trapeze‖ (Figure 2.36), which predated
      today‘s Air Force Thunderbirds, consisted of
      sergeant pilots William C. McDonald and John H.
      Williamson, as well as Lieutenant Haywood S.
      Hansell. The team was chosen by Captain Claire
      Chennault. During the decades following WWI,
      the Army Air Corps participated in a series of
      national races to arouse interest in aviation and to
      promote favorable public support for military
      aeronautics. These events often featured trios of
      Army, Navy, and Marine Corps pilots who
      competed against each other in exhibitions of aero
      acrobatics and precision flying. This competition
      essentially ended at the 1934 Cleveland National
      Air Races when a team of stunt fliers from
      Maxwell Field AL put on a dazzling display of
      acrobatic flying that stole the show.
      2.14.7. As a second world war loomed, the now-
      established General Headquarters (GHQ) Air
      Force viewed enlisted pilots in a more positive
      light. The Army Air Forces decided to revitalize
      the tradition of the flying sergeant and launched a
      massive program of enlisted pilot training. The
      pressures of war broke down some of the
      prejudices and eroded even more rapidly the old
      ―standard‖ of who qualified as a suitable flyer.
      2.14.8. Throughout WWII, enlisted pilots flew fighters, transports, medium bombers, medical evacuation and
      photoreconnaissance aircraft.

      2.14.9. When WWII ended, two old-time sergeant pilots,                 Figure 2.37. George Holmes.
      George Holmes (Figure 2.37) and Tom Rafferty, then still serving
      as officers, opted for separation. Each immediately re-enlisted in
      his permanent grade as master sergeant and retained his
      aeronautical rating. In 1947, when the Air Force became a
      separate service, the two sergeants elected to ―suit up‖ in the new
      Air Force blue uniform, thus becoming the first, last, and only
      sergeant pilots to serve in the U.S. Air Force. Sadly, late in 1949,
      Rafferty lost his life in the crash of a C-47 near Donner Pass on
      the California-Nevada border. This left George Holmes as the sole
      member of the breed. His retirement in 1957 ended the enlisted
      pilot era for the Air Force.
      2.14.10. In November 1942, Public Law 99, the law that
      authorized the training of staff sergeant pilots, was replaced by
      Public Law 658, the Flight Officer Act of July 8, 1942. With rare
      exceptions, those sergeant pilots produced by the program were
      promoted to flight officers. The history of enlisted pilots, which
      began with Corporal Vernon Burge in 1912, came to an end.
      2.14.11. Was the Staff Sergeant Pilot Program a good idea? Did it
      work? Records indicate sergeant pilots acquitted themselves very
      well. Seventeen became aces. At least 760 sergeant pilots retired
      as field grade officers (major through colonel), and 11 became
      general officers.
2.15. Conclusion.
      This chapter documents the lives and activities of enlisted men
      and women so you, the reader, will gain an understanding of what it means to be enlisted. From Fort Meyer, Virginia,
      to Afghanistan 105 years later, the United States Air Force has grown into the finest air force in the world. You can
      take pride in the efforts and accomplishments of enlisted pioneers of the United States Air Force and its predecessor
      organizations who, through their own sacrifices, made the Air Force enlisted corps what it is today. Without their
      many contributions, none of that would have been possible.

                                                         Chapter 3
                                                    ORGANIZATION

Section 3A—Overview
3.1. Introduction.
      The Armed Forces of the United States are not separate and independent parts of the government; rather, they
      compose one of the instruments of national policy. Since the birth of the Nation, policies and directives have been
      made by civilians assigned to the military and to the executive and legislative branches of the government. Military
      leaders do not make national military policy decisions. Civilian leadership is a key concept in the military
      organization, beginning with the President‘s role as Commander in Chief (CINC). This chapter begins with a
      discussion of the President‘s role. The chapter highlights the structure of the Department of Defense (DoD) and
      defines the roles of the military departments, Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), unified combatant commands, and combined
      commands. Finally, this chapter emphasizes the key elements of the Department of the Air Force, focuses on force
      structure and major commands (MAJCOM), and includes a discussion about the structure and functions of the various
      lower levels of command and air reserve components.
Section 3B—Command Authority
3.2. Commander in Chief.
      The U.S. Constitution establishes the basic principle of civilian control of the Armed Forces. As CINC, the President
      has final command authority. However, as head of the executive branch, he is subject to the checks and balances
      system of the legislative and judicial branches.
Section 3C—Department of Defense
3.3. Department of Defense.
      Established by the National Security Act of 1947, the DoD‘s function is to maintain and employ Armed Forces. The
      DoD includes the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD); the JCS; the Joint Staff; and the Departments of the
      Army, Navy (including the U.S. Marine Corps), and Air Force. Furthermore, the DoD includes the unified combatant
      commands and forces dedicated to combined commands, defense agencies, and DoD field activities. As the civilian
      head of the DoD, the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) reports directly to the President.
3.4. Secretary of Defense.
      The President appoints the SECDEF with the advice and consent of the Senate. The SECDEF serves as principal
      defense policy advisor to the President and is responsible for the formulation of general defense policy and policy
      related to all matters of direct and primary concern to the DoD and for the execution of approved policy. The
      operational chain of command runs from the President to the SECDEF to the combatant commanders. SECDEF
      specific responsibilities include providing written policy guidance for DoD component chief use to prepare and review
      program recommendations and budget proposals. The Secretary‘s guidance includes national security objectives and
      policies, military mission priorities, and the resource levels projected for availability. The SECDEF also provides the
      Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) with written policy guidance to prepare and review contingency plans. The
      Secretaries of the military departments and the commanders of the combatant commands are provided written
      guidelines to direct the effective detection and monitoring of all potential aerial and maritime threats to the national
      security of the United States.
      3.4.1. The Armed Forces Policy Council.
             The Armed Forces Policy Council assists in matters requiring a long-range view and in formulating broad
             defense policy. The council advises the SECDEF on matters of broad policy and reports on other matters as
             requested. The council consists of the SECDEF (Chairman); the Deputy SECDEF; Secretaries of the Army,
             Navy, and Air Force; the CJCS; Under Secretaries of Defense; the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for
             Acquisition; and the four service chiefs. Sometimes other departments and agencies in the executive branch are
             invited to attend specific meetings.
      3.4.2. Under Secretaries of Defense.
             There are five Under Secretaries of Defense (Policy; Comptroller; Personnel and Readiness; Acquisition,
             Technology and Logistics; and Intelligence) who assist the SECDEF. The SECDEF receives staff assistance
             through a number of special agencies, such as the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), Security Service,
             and Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), which provide special skills, expertise, and advice.

3.5. Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff.
       Appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff
       (CJCS) is selected from the officers of the regular components of the Armed Forces. The Chairman, while so serving,
       holds the grade of general or, in the case of the Navy, holds the grade of admiral, and outranks all other officers of the
       Armed Forces. However, the Chairman may not exercise military command over the JCS or any of the Armed Forces.
       The operational chain of command runs from the President to the SECDEF to the combatant commanders. However, a
       provision of the Goldwater-Nichols DoD Reorganization Act of 1986 permits the President to authorize
       communications through the CJCS. Consequently, DoDD 5100.01, Functions of the Department of Defense and Its
       Major Components, places the CJCS in the communications chain of command. The CJCS is the principal military
       advisor to the President, the National Security Council, and the SECDEF. Further, the SECDEF may assign
       responsibility for overseeing the activities of the combatant commands to the CJCS.
3.6. Joint Chiefs of Staff:
       3.6.1. Subject to the authority, direction, and control of the President and the SECDEF, members of the Joint Chiefs of
       Staff (JCS) serve as advisors to the President, SECDEF, and the National Security Council. They provide the strategic
       direction of the Armed Forces. They review major materiel and personnel requirements of the Armed Forces according
       to strategic and logistic requirements and establish joint doctrine. Members of the JCS are also responsible for the
       assignment of logistic responsibilities to the military services, formulation of policies for joint training, and
       coordination of military education.
       3.6.2. Members of the JCS consist of the CJCS; Vice Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (VCJCS); Chief of Staff (CS),
       U.S. Army (CSA); Chief of Naval Operations (CNO); Chief of Staff, U.S. Air Force (CSAF); and Commandant of the
       Marine Corps (CMC). The CJCS serves as a member of and presides over the JCS and furnishes the recommendations
       and views of the JCS to the President, National Security Council, or the SECDEF. Other members of the JCS may also
       provide advice to these bodies, when requested. If a member disagrees with an opinion of the CJCS, the CJCS must
       present this advice in addition to his or her own. For the service chiefs (CSA, CNO, CSAF, CMC), their JCS duties
       take precedence over all other duties. Consequently, as the military heads of their respective services, JCS members
       delegate many duties to their vice chiefs of staff while retaining overall responsibility.
3.7. Joint Staff.
       The Joint Staff assists members of the JCS in carrying out their assigned responsibilities of strategic direction, unified
       operation of combatant commands, and the integration of all land, naval, and air forces into an efficient force. By law,
       the direction of the Joint Staff rests exclusively with the CJCS. The staff‘s more than 1,500 military and civilian
       personnel are composed of approximately even numbers of officers from the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Marines
       make up about 20 percent of the number allocated to the Navy.
3.8. Unified Combatant Commands and Combined Commands:
       3.8.1. Unified Combatant Commands.
              The President, assisted by the CJCS through the SECDEF, establishes unified combatant commands for the
              performance of military missions. The SECDEF assigns military missions. The combatant commander deploys,
              directs, controls, and coordinates the action of the command‘s forces; conducts joint training exercises; and
              controls certain support functions. Combatant commanders are responsible to both the SECDEF and the
              President. The component commanders or the commanders of subordinate commands exercise operational
              control. A unified combatant command has a broad, continuing mission and is composed of forces from two or
              more military departments. The organization of Unified commands are on a geographical and functional basis
              and include the U.S. European Command (USEUCOM), U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM), U.S. Northern
              Command (USNORTHCOM), U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM), U.S. Central Command
              (USCENTCOM), U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), U.S. Transportation Command
              (USTRANSCOM), and U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM). Once assigned to a unified command, a
              force cannot be transferred except by authority of the SECDEF or under special procedures of the SECDEF
              office with the approval of the President. All units not assigned to a unified command remain with their
              respective services.
       3.8.2. Combined Commands.
              Combined commands consist of forces from more than one allied nation. Since combined commands are
              binational or multinational, their missions and responsibilities (including command responsibilities) must
              establish, assign, and conform with binational and multinational agreements. Normally a combined command
              operates under the terms of a treaty, alliance, or bilateral agreement between or among the nations concerned.
AFPAM36-2241        1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                         55

            The North American Aerospace Defense Command, Combined Forces Command Korea, and Allied Command
            Operations are examples of multinational commands.
3.9. Military Departments.
      The military departments consist of the Army, Navy (including the Marine Corps and, in wartime, the Coast Guard),
      and the Air Force. The Service Secretaries are responsible for providing efficiently organized, trained, and equipped
      ready forces to the combatant commanders. Although operational command of the forces rests with the combatant
      commanders under the direction of the SECDEF, the Service Secretaries assist the SECDEF in managing the
      administrative, training, and logistic functions of the military departments. Except in operational matters, the SECDEF
      can issue orders to a Service through its Secretary. Each Service develops and trains its forces to perform functions
      that support the efforts of other Services to accomplish the overall military objectives. The military departments share
      general and specific functions as outlined below, and the Air Force has primary functions designed to support the
      general and specific functions of the military departments.
      3.9.1. General Functions.
            The traditional roles and mission of each branch of Service are commonly referred to as functions. Besides
            specific combat roles, they furnish operational forces to unified commands. The SECDEF and the JCS
            established the functions of each branch of the Armed Forces in the Key West Agreement of 1948. The Key
            West Agreement was revised in 1953 and again in 1958. The general functions of the Armed Forces are to:
            3.9.1.1. Support and defend the U.S. Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
            3.9.1.2. Ensure, by timely and effective military action, the security of the United States, its possessions, and
            areas vital to its interests.
            3.9.1.3. Uphold and advance the national policies and interests of the United States.
      3.9.2. Specific Functions.
            Along with general functions, military departments also have some specific functions they share. These include,
            but are not limited to:
            3.9.2.1. Preparing forces and establishing reserves of personnel, equipment, and supplies for effective
            prosecution of war and military operations short of war, and planning for the expansion of peacetime
            components to meet the needs of war.
            3.9.2.2. Maintaining, in readiness, mobile reserve forces properly organized, trained, and equipped for
            deployment in an emergency.
            3.9.2.3. Preparing and submitting to the SECDEF budgets for their respective departments, and justifying
            (before Congress) budget requests as approved by the SECDEF.
            3.9.2.4. Administering the funds made available for maintaining, equipping, and training the forces of their
            respective departments, including those assigned to unified commands.
            3.9.2.5. Assisting each other in accomplishing their respective functions, including the provision of personnel,
            intelligence, training, facilities, equipment, supplies, and services.
Section 3D—Department of the Air Force
3.10. Overview.
      Headquarters Air Force and its field units comprise the Department of the Air Force. They are responsible for
      preparing the air and space forces necessary for the effective prosecution of war and military operations short of war
      for the expansion of the peacetime components of the Air Force to meet the needs of war.
3.11. Primary Functions of the Air Force.
      The primary functions of the Air Force include, but are not limited to the following:
      3.11.1. Organize, train, equip, and provide forces for the conduct of prompt and sustained combat operations in the air
      and space—specifically, forces to defend the United States against air and space attack, gain and maintain air and
      space supremacy, defeat enemy air and space forces, and conduct space operations.
      3.11.2. Organize, train, equip, and provide forces for strategic air and missile warfare.
56                                                                                     1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
      3.11.3. Organize, equip, and provide forces for joint amphibious, space, and airborne operations, in coordination with
      the other military Services, and provide for their training according to joint doctrines.
      3.11.4. Organize, train, equip, and provide forces for close air support and air logistic support to the Army and other
      forces, as directed, including airlift, air support, resupply of airborne operations, aerial photography, tactical air
      reconnaissance, and air interdiction of enemy land forces and communications.
      3.11.5. Organize, train, equip, and provide forces, as directed, to operate air and space lines of communications.
      3.11.6. Organize, train, equip, and provide forces for the support and conduct of psychological operations.
      3.11.7. Provide equipment, forces, procedures, and doctrine necessary for effective electronic warfare operations.
3.12. Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF).
      The Secretary of the Air Force is a civilian appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the
      Senate. The SECAF is the head of the Department of the Air Force and is subject to the authority, control, and
      direction of the SECDEF. The SECAF is responsible for recruiting, organizing, supplying, equipping (including
      research and development), training, servicing, mobilizing, demobilizing, and administering (including morale and
      welfare) personnel; maintaining, constructing, outfitting, and repairing military equipment; constructing, maintaining,
      and repairing buildings, structures, and utilities; and acquiring real property and interests in real property necessary to
      carry out the responsibilities specified in Title 10 United States Code (U.S.C.) Section 8013.
3.13. Chief of Staff, U.S. Air Force.
      The Chief of Staff, U.S. Air Force (CSAF) is an Air Force general officer appointed for 4 years by the President, by
      and with the advice and consent of the Senate. The CSAF is subject to the authority, direction, and control of the
      SECAF, and presides over the Air Staff; acts as an agent in carrying out Air Staff-approved recommendations or plans
      by the SECAF; exercises supervision consistent with the authority assigned to commanders of unified or specified
      combatant commands and organizations of the Air Force as the Secretary determines; is subject to the authority,
      direction, and control of the SECDEF; and, as a member of the JCS, informs the SECAF regarding military advice
      rendered by the JCS on matters affecting the Department of the Air Force.
3.14. Air National Guard (ANG).
      The Air National Guard is administered by the National Guard Bureau, a joint
      bureau of the departments of the Army and Air Force, located in the Pentagon,
      Washington DC. ANG is one of the seven Reserve components of the U.S.
      Armed Forces that augment the active components in the performance of their
      missions. Note: The ANG is not a MAJCOM, but is a very important
      component of the Total Force in offensive, defensive, and relief operations.
      3.14.1. Mission.
             The ANG has both a federal and state mission. The dual mission, a
             provision of the U.S. Constitution, results in each guardsman holding
             membership in the National Guard of his or her state and in the National
             Guard of the United States.
      3.14.2. Federal Mission.
             The ANG‘s federal mission is to maintain well-trained, well-equipped units available for prompt mobilization
             during war and to provide assistance during national emergencies (such as natural disasters or civil
             disturbances). During peacetime, the combat-ready units and support units are assigned to most Air Force
             MAJCOMs to carry out missions compatible with training, mobilization readiness, humanitarian and
             contingency operations such as Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. ANG units may be activated in a
             number of ways as prescribed by public law. Most of the laws may be found in 10 U.S.C.
      3.14.3. State Mission.
             When ANG units are not mobilized or under federal control, they report to the governor of their respective state,
             territory (Puerto Rico, Guam, Virgin Islands), or the commanding general of the District of Columbia National
             Guard. Each of the 54 National Guard organizations is supervised by the adjutant general of the state or
             territory. Under state law, the ANG provides protection of life and property, and preserves peace, order, and
             public safety. These missions are accomplished through emergency relief support during natural disasters such
             as floods, earthquakes, and forest fires; search-and-rescue operations; support to civil defense authorities; and
             maintenance of vital public services, and counterdrug operations.
AFPAM36-2241         1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                       57

      3.14.4. Personnel.
             The ANG has more than 106,000 officers and enlisted personnel who serve in 88 flying units and 579
             independent support units. The primary sources of full-time support for ANG units are the dual-status military
             technicians and guardsmen on active duty. These people perform day-to-day management, administration, and
             maintenance. By law, dual-status military technicians are civil service employees of the federal government
             who must be military members of the unit that employs them. Technicians train with the unit and are mobilized
             with it when it‘s activated. Active duty members serve under the command authority of their respective state or
             territorial governors until mobilized for federal duty.
3.15. Air Staff.
      The function of the Air Staff is to assist the SECAF in carrying out his or her responsibilities. The Air Staff is
      composed of the following: (1) the Chief of Staff, (2) Vice Chief of Staff, (3) Deputy Chiefs of Staff, (4) Assistant
      Chiefs of Staff, (5) Surgeon General of the Air Force, (6) Judge Advocate General of the Air Force, (7) Chief of the
      Air Force Reserve, (8) other members of the Air Force assigned or detailed to the Air Staff, and (9) civilian employees
      in the Department of the Air Force assigned or detailed to the Air Staff.
3.16. Headquarters U.S. Air Force (HQ USAF).
      The headquarters of the Air Force consists of two major entities: the Secretariat (including the SECAF and the
      Secretary‘s principal staff) and the Air Staff headed by the Chief of Staff.
3.17. Field Units.
       The Department of the Air Force field units includes MAJCOMs, field operating agencies (FOA), and direct reporting
       units (DRU).
       3.17.1. MAJCOMs.
             The Air Force is organized functionally in the United States and geographically overseas. A Major Command
             (MAJCOM) represents a major Air Force subdivision having a specific portion of the Air Force mission. Each
             MAJCOM is directly subordinate to HQ USAF. MAJCOMs are interrelated and complementary, providing
             offensive, defensive, and support elements. An operational command consists (in whole or in part) of strategic,
             tactical, space, or defense forces, or of flying forces that directly support such forces. A support command may
             provide supplies, weapon systems, support systems, operational support equipment, combat materiel,
             maintenance, surface transportation, education and training, or special services and other supported
             organizations. The MAJCOMs in the U.S. Air Force include:
             3.17.1.1. Air Combat Command (ACC). Air Combat Command, with
             headquarters at Langley AFB VA, was created 1 June 1992, which
             combined its predecessors, Strategic Air Command and Tactical Air
             Command.
             3.17.1.1.1. Mission. ACC prepares assigned forces for air combat in a
             theater of operations. ACC organizes, trains, and equips forces for joint or
             combined operations in the roles of aerospace control, force application,
             force enhancement, and force support.
             3.17.1.1.2. Responsibilities. ACC will organize, train, and equip combat-
             ready forces; provide air forces for USSTRATCOM; support the Drug
             Enforcement Agency and U.S. Customs Agency in monitoring and
             intercepting illegal drug traffic entering the United States; test and acquire new or improved combat systems
             and equipment, through United States Atlantic Command (USACOM), provide combat-ready forces, support,
             and equipment to unified commands when directed by JCS; provide air defense forces to United States Element
             North American Air Defense Command (USELNORAD); provide C-130s and air mobility mission support
             forces to United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM); serve as gaining MAJCOM for assigned
             Air Force Reserve (AFR) and Air National Guard (ANG) forces; and mobilize or recall these forces to active
             duty for follow-on assignment to combatant commands as authorized by Headquarters Air Force (HAF).
             3.17.1.1.3. Personnel and Resources. More than 67,000 active-duty members and 13,500 civilians make up

           associate units that share aircraft with active duty units. Four space operations squadrons share satellite control
           mission with the active force. More than 620 mission support units exist in the AFRC, equipped and trained to
           provide a wide range of services, including medical and aeromedical evacuation, aerial port, civil engineer,
           security force, intelligence, communications, mobility support, logistics and transportation operations, among
           others.
     3.17.2. Field Operating Agencies (FOA).
           FOAs are subdivisions of the Air Force directly subordinate to a HAF functional manager. A FOA performs
           field activities beyond the scope of the MAJCOMs. The activities are specialized or associated with an Air
           Force-wide mission and do not include functions performed in management headquarters (such as AMC),
           unless specifically directed by a DoD authority. Two examples are the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC)
           under the Deputy Chief of Staff for Manpower, Personnel, and Services, and the Air Force Office of Special
           Investigations (AFOSI) under The Inspector General. Similar organizations at MAJCOM level are called
           MAJCOM FOAs.
     3.17.3. Direct Reporting Units (DRU).
           DRUs are Air Force subdivisions directly subordinate to the CSAF. A DRU performs a mission that does not fit
           into any of the MAJCOMs. A DRU has many of the same administrative and organizational responsibilities as a
           MAJCOM. Two examples are the Air Force District of Washington and the USAF Academy.
3.18. Lower Levels of Command.
     Below MAJCOM are several levels of command. The Air Force component commands and numbered Air Forces
     (NAF) administratively report directly to the MAJCOM. Wings, groups, squadrons, and flights report to either an Air
     Force component command or a NAF, whichever is appropriate.
     3.18.1. Air Force Component Numbered Air Forces (CNAF).
           The Air Force has established 13 new Air Force Component Numbered Air Forces, dedicated to supporting the
           unified/sub-unified combatant command and joint task force commanders. These new CNAFs (nicknamed war-
           fighting headquarters) are the primary operational-level war-fighting and Air Force component commands. The
           CNAF headquarters consists of an Air Force forces (AFFOR) staff and an assigned air and space operations
           center (AOC). They are dedicated to supporting the unified combatant commander and his/her subordinate joint
           force commanders across the full range of military operations. The CNAF commander will be prepared to
           assume responsibilities as the joint force air component commander (JFACC) for joint military operations in his
           or her respective area of operations (AO), and command a joint task force as required.
     3.18.2. Numbered Air Force (NAF).
           The Numbered Air Force is an administrative level of command directly under a MAJCOM. NAFs provide
           intermediate level operational leadership and supervision. They do not have complete functional staffs. The
           number of personnel assigned varies but should not exceed 99 manpower authorizations without an approved
           waiver from HQ USAF/A1M. A NAF is assigned subordinate units, such as wings, groups, and squadrons.
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                         63

      3.18.3. Wing.
            The wing is a level of command below the NAF and has a distinct mission with significant scope. A wing is
            responsible for maintaining the installation and may have several squadrons in more than one dependent group.
            The different types of wings are operational, air base, or specialized mission. Wings will have a minimum
            adjusted population of at least 1,000. This will include manpower authorizations, students, and a percentage of
            contractor workforces. See Figure 3.1 for a common wing structure.
            3.18.3.1. Operational Wing. An operational wing is one that has an operations group and related operational
            mission activity assigned. When an operational wing performs the primary mission of the base, it usually
            maintains and operates the base. In addition, an operational wing is capable of self-support in functional areas
            such as maintenance and munitions, as needed. When an operational wing is a tenant organization, the host
            command provides it with varying degrees of base and logistics support.
            3.18.3.2. Air Base Wing. An air base wing performs a support function rather than an operational mission. This
            type of wing maintains and operates a base. An air base wing often provides functional support to a MAJCOM
            headquarters.
            3.18.3.3. Specialized Mission Wing. A specialized mission wing performs a specialized mission and usually
            does not have aircraft or missiles assigned. Examples include intelligence wings, training wings, and so on. This
            wing is either a host or a tenant wing, depending on whether it maintains and operates the base.
Figure 3.1. Wing Organization.




      3.18.4. Group.
            A group is a level of command below the wing. Like the NAF, a group is a tactical echelon with minimal staff
            support. A group usually has two or more subordinate units. A dependent group is a mission, logistics, support,
            medical, or large functional unit, such as a civil engineer group. Such groups may possess small supporting staff
            elements that are organized as sections, such as standardization and evaluation or quality control. An
            independent group has the same functions and responsibilities as a like-type wing, but its scope and size do not
            warrant wing-level designation. Groups will have a minimum adjusted population of at least 400. This includes
            manpower authorizations, students, and a percentage of contractor workforces.
64                                                                                   1 OCTOBER 2013           AFPAM36-2241
     3.18.5. Squadron.
           The squadron is the basic unit in the Air Force. The different types of squadrons are either a mission unit, such
           as an operational flying squadron, or a functional unit, such as a civil engineer, security forces, or logistics
           readiness squadron. Squadrons vary in size according to responsibility. Squadrons will have a minimum
           adjusted population of at least 35. This includes manpower authorizations, students, and a percentage of
           contractor workforces.
     3.18.6. Flight.
           If internal subdivision is required, a flight may consist of sections, then elements. The different types of flights
           are numbered/named, alpha, or functional.
           3.18.6.1. Numbered/Named Flight. This is the lowest level unit in the Air Force. A numbered or named flight
           primarily incorporates smaller elements into an organized unit. Its administrative characteristics, such as
           strength reporting, are like those of a squadron.
           3.18.6.2. Alpha Flight. Alpha flights are part of a squadron (usually a mission squadron) and composed of
           several elements that perform identical missions. Because an alpha flight is not a unit, this type of a flight is not
           subject to unit reporting.
           3.18.6.3. Functional Flight. Functional flights are usually part of a squadron and composed of elements that
           perform specific missions. Because a functional flight is not a unit, this type of a flight is not subject to unit
           reporting.
3.19. Air Reserve Component (ARC):
     3.19.1. Components.
           The ANG and AFR form a significant part of our aerospace capability. Together they are called the Air Reserve
           Component (ARC). Forces are drawn from the ARC when circumstances require the active force to rapidly
           expand. AFPD 10-3, Air Reserve Component Forces, establishes policy to fully integrate the ANG, AFR, and
           active Air Force into a single Total Force.
     3.19.2. Staffing and Equipping.
           ARC forces are staffed and trained to meet the same training standards and readiness levels as active component
           forces and are supplied with the same equipment on an equal priority. The active force can only withdraw,
           divert, or reassign equipment for other commitments with the SECDEF‘s written approval. To ensure
           responsiveness and combat readiness, ARC forces are continuously evaluated and modernized.
     3.19.3. Use.
           AFPD 10-3 states, under the Total Force policy established by DoD in 1973, that both regular and reserve assets
           are considered parts of a single U.S. military resource. All aspects of regular and reserve forces are considered
           when determining an appropriate force mix. Significant factors include contribution of forces to national
           security; availability of forces in view of time, statutory or regulatory constraints; and the cost to equip and
           maintain forces. Considerations unique to ANG units include their dual state and federal missions.
     3.19.4. Organization.
           ANG and AFR unit organization parallels similar active force units with one exception: ARC units are
           sometimes separated to take advantage of state or regional demographics and are not centralized at major,
           multisquadron bases, as is the case with active-duty resources. This exception is beneficial because it
           implements a strong relationship with the civilian community and builds public support for the Air Force as a
           whole.
     3.19.5. Jurisdiction.
           Command jurisdiction for nonmobilized ANG units is vested in the governor of the state, commonwealth, or
           possession, or in the President, who in essence is the governor of the District of Columbia. The President
           delegates authority to the Secretary of the Army to carry out the powers of the President as ―governor‖ of the
           District of Columbia. Command of nonmobilized AFR units is exercised through the Commander, AFR, who,
           in turn, is responsible to the CSAF. Command of nonmobilized AFR individual mobilization augmentees is
           exercised through the unit of assignment. Whenever the President authorizes involuntary activation, the SECAF
           delegates authority to gaining MAJCOM commanders who order ANG and AFR forces to active duty. When
           activated, operational command of ARC forces transfers to the gaining MAJCOM commander who is also
           responsible for establishing training resources for all assigned ARC forces.
AFPAM36-2241        1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                      65

3.20. Conclusion.
      Organized with civilian leadership throughout, the Armed Forces of the United States are not separate and independent
      parts of the government but serve as instruments of national policy. This chapter began with a discussion of the
      President‘s role as CINC and continued with the DoD, JCS, unified combatant commands, and combined commands.
      In addition, this chapter contained information on the Department of the Air Force and focused on force structure and
      MAJCOMs. Finally, the chapter included a discussion of the structure and functions of the various lower levels of
      command and Air Reserve components.

      AIR FORCE DOCTRINE, AIR AND SPACE EXPEDITIONARY FORCE (AEF), AND JOINT FORCE
Section 4A—Overview
4.1. Introduction:
      4.1.1. America‘s Air Force faces significant challenges. We have been engaged in combat for 24 years while
      transforming into a smaller, leaner, and more capable force. Fiscal constraints combined with operational challenges
      and a dynamic international security environment translate into risks we continue to manage and mitigate in order to
      provide capabilities America needs. The Air Force continues to fight the war on terrorism and prepares to face and
      overcome threats and conflicts of the future. In order to remain dominant, we must maintain our air, space, and
      cyberspace power advantages over potential adversaries. Modern warfare is changing. This is not new for America‘s
      Airmen, whose heritage spans and embraces change and whose culture embodies courage and innovation.
      4.1.2. Meeting the challenges in this rapidly changing world requires we understand and apply Air Force doctrine.
      Airmen in the past may have not understood or consistently applied doctrine. The complexity of integrating fighting
      elements and meshing joint and combined doctrine, and the uncertainty inherent in rapidly developing contingency
      operations demand that planning and employment be understood and repeatable. We must learn and practice our own
      doctrine. We know how to do it right; we have taken the time to argue it out, write it down, and publish it. We must
      understand what it means to be an Airman, and we must be able to articulate what air and space power can bring to the
      joint fight. AFDD 1, Air Force Basic Doctrine, Organization and Command, is the Air Force‘s premier statement of
      our beliefs, the cornerstone upon which our service identity is based, and the source from which our doctrine flows.
      4.1.3. The AEF is the Air Force methodology for presenting forces to combatant commanders (CCDR). Three
      principles are the foundation upon which the AEF is structured and executed: transparency, predictability, and
      equitability. Transparency is the sense that there is no mystery to the process; when, why, and how should be visible
      and understandable by every Airman. Every Air Force member is responsible for knowing and understanding the AEF
      original structure, how we deploy today‘s AEF, and our goals for the future. Alignment of forces across AEF
      pairs/blocks allows our Air Force to determine who goes first, defines our battle rhythm, and provides a logically
      organized structure during surge periods to support combatant commanders.
      4.1.4. Joint warfare is team warfare. Over time, the American experience in war increasingly demanded cooperation,
      coordination, and integration of all U.S. military Services. Today, joint operations are routine and, thus, routinely
      practiced. Effectively integrated joint forces are able to rapidly and efficiently identify and engage adversary weak
      points and vulnerabilities, without exposing their own weak points or seams, to ensure mission accomplishment.
      Whether there are years to prepare and plan (as in the World War II Normandy invasion), months (as in Operation
      Desert Storm), or only a few weeks (as in Operation Enduring Freedom), American armed forces must always be
      ready to operate in smoothly functioning, joint teams.
Section 4B—Air Force Doctrine
4.2. Doctrine:
      4.2.1. Air Force doctrine is a statement of officially sanctioned beliefs, war-fighting principles, and terminology that
      describes and guides the proper use of air, space, and cyberspace power in military operations. It is what we have
      come to understand, based on our experiences to date.
      4.2.2. The Air Force promulgates and teaches doctrine as a common frame of reference on the best way to prepare and
      employ Air Force forces. Subsequently, doctrine shapes the manner in which the Air Force organizes, trains, equips,
      and sustains its forces. Doctrine prepares us for future uncertainties and provides a common set of understandings on
      which Airmen base their decisions. Doctrine consists of the fundamental principles by which military forces guide
      their actions in support of national objectives; it is the linchpin of successful military operations. It also provides us
      with common terminology, conveying precision in expressing our ideas.
      4.2.3. In application, doctrine should be used with judgment. It must never be dismissed out of hand or through
      ignorance of its principles, nor should it be employed blindly without due regard for the mission and situation at hand.
      On the other hand, following doctrine to the letter is not the fundamental intent. Rather, good doctrine is somewhat
      akin to a good ―commander‘s intent‖: it provides sufficient information on what to do, but does not specifically say
      how to do it. We must strive above all else to be doctrinally sound, not doctrinally bound.
      4.2.4. In the current turbulent environment of expeditionary operations and the emerging arena of homeland security,
      doctrine provides an informed starting point for the many decisions Airmen must make in what seems to be a
68                                                                                      1 OCTOBER 2013           AFPAM36-2241
     continuous series of deployments. We no longer face the challenge of starting with a blank sheet of paper; with
     doctrine, Airmen now have a good outline that lays out the basic issues:
            4.2.4.1. What is my mission?
            4.2.4.2. How should I approach it?
            4.2.4.3. What should my organization look like, and why?
            4.2.4.4. What are my lines of authority within my organization and within the joint force?
            4.2.4.5. What degrees of control do I have over my forces?
            4.2.4.6. How am I supported? Who do I call for more support?
     Note: From one operation to the next, many things are actually constant. Doctrine, properly applied, often can provide
     a 70-, 80-, or even 90-percent solution to most questions, allowing leaders to focus on the remainder, which usually
     involves tailoring for the specific operation.
     4.2.5. Good doctrine informs, provides a sound departure point, and allows flexibility; bad doctrine overly binds and
     restricts creativity. If not properly developed, and especially if parochialism is allowed to creep in, doctrine will point
     to suboptimal solutions. Parochialism and other biases can come from within a Service as well as between Services.
     Professionals will still have honest differences of opinions, but when those opinions are not based on sound war-
     fighting practices, inefficiency and ineffectiveness frequently result. Good doctrine can help, but it must be
     intelligently applied.
     4.2.6. Doctrine is about warfighting, not physics. This principle specifically addresses the perceived differences
     between operations in air, space, and cyberspace. Air, space, and cyberspace are separate domains requiring
     exploitation of different sets of physical laws to operate in, but are linked by the effects they can produce together. To
     achieve a common purpose, air, space, and cyberspace need to be integrated. Therefore, Air Force doctrine focuses on
     the best means to obtain war-fighting effects regardless of the domain in which a platform operates. As an example,
     Airmen should be concerned with the best means of employing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR)
     capabilities, not whether a particular ISR platform is airborne or in orbit, or manned or unmanned. This is requisite to
     achieving true integration across any given collection of forces.
     4.2.7. Doctrine is about effects, not platforms. This focuses on the desired outcome of a particular action, not on the
     system or weapon itself that provides the effect. For example, doctrine states that Airmen should seek to achieve air
     superiority, but doctrine does not focus on which platforms should be used to achieve that effect. A parallel example is
     seen in the recognition that bombers are not ―strategic,‖ nor are fighters ―tactical.‖ It does not matter if an F-16 or a B-
     52 accomplishes a given task, whether a particular platform is manned or unmanned, or whether a C-17 or a C-130
     delivers a certain load, or if a particular ISR platform is airborne or in orbit; the outcome of the mission—the effect
     achieved—is what‘s important. Thus, Air Force doctrine does not explicitly tie specific weapon systems to specific
     tasks or effects.
     4.2.8. Doctrine is about using domains, not owning domains. This illustrates the importance of properly using a
     domain to obtain the best war-fighting effects, not of carving up the operational environment based on service or
     functional parochialism. Focusing on using a domain is a vital first step to integration of efforts. ―Ownership‖
     arguments eventually lead to suboptimal (and usually at best tactical) application of efforts at the expense of the larger,
     total effort.
     4.2.9. Doctrine is about organization, not organizations. Modern warfare demands that disparate parts of different
     Services, different nations, and even differing functions within a single Service be brought together intelligently to
     achieve unity of effort and unity of command. However, merely placing different organizations together in an area of
     operations is insufficient to meet these demands. A single, cohesive organization is required with clearly defined lines
     of command and commanders with requisite authorities at appropriate levels. Doctrine explains why certain
     organizational structures are preferred over others and describes effective command relationships and command
     authorities; this facilitates the rapid standup of joint and service organizations during rapidly evolving situations.
     Ultimately, doctrine is not about whether one particular element is more decisive than another, nor about positing that
     element as the centerpiece of joint operations; it‘s the total, tailored joint force that‘s decisive. Getting to that effective
     joint force requires smart organization.
     4.2.10. Doctrine is about synergy, not segregation. True integration of effort cannot be achieved by merely carving up
     the operational environment. While segregation may have some benefit and may appear the simplest way from a
     command and control viewpoint to manage elements of a diverse joint force, it may actually suboptimize the overall
     effort. It guarantees that the whole will never be greater than the sum of its parts. For example, Airmen should have
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                            69

      access to the entire theater of operations to maximize their ability to achieve the joint force commander‘s (JFC)
      objectives; they should not be restricted from any area due to unnecessarily restrictive fire support coordination
      measures. Also, segregating the operational environment into smaller areas of operation may create competition for
      scarce, high-demand, low-density capabilities, and reduce combat effectiveness.
      4.2.11. Doctrine is about integration, not just synchronization. According to JP 1-02, Department of Defense
      Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, synchronization is the arrangement of military actions in time, space,
      and purpose to produce maximum relative combat power at a decisive place and time; integration, by comparison, is
      the arrangement of military forces and their actions to create a force that operates by engaging as a whole.
      Synchronization is, in essence, deconfliction in time and space between different units. It is a useful means to plan and
      execute operations and to prevent fratricide. Synchronization emphasizes timing, while integration considers priority
      and effect to be both efficient and effective with scarce resources. Synchronization is bottom up; integration, on the
      other hand, starts at the top with a single cohesive plan and works downward. Synchronization is an additive ―sum of
      the parts‖ model, while integration may produce geometric results. This is not to say that synchronization is bad. For
      surface forces, it is very useful for managing their scheme of maneuver. However, from an Airman‘s perspective,
      synchronization is a tactical tool and doesn‘t necessarily scale up to the operational level. Thus, Airmen should seek to
      integrate, not merely synchronize, joint operational planning.
      4.2.12. Doctrine is about what‘s important, not who‘s important. Good doctrine should point to the important things a
      commander should do and explain why they should be done. It should not be an advertisement for any particular
      element of the U.S. Air Force, nor assert the relative value of any one Service over another. Different parts of the U.S.
      Armed Forces do different things, and each has its own utility depending on the situation. It‘s all about the right
      capability to best accomplish the mission.
      4.2.13. Doctrine is about the right force, not just equal shares of the force. This addresses the proper mix of Service
      components within a joint force. Some believe that a joint force requires equal parts of all the Services. This is
      incorrect. As one senior U.S. Air Force officer said, ―Joint warfighting is not like Little League baseball, where
      everybody gets a chance to play.‖ Any given joint force should be tailored appropriately for the task at hand. Some
      operations will be land centric, others air centric, and others still maritime centric. The composition of the joint force
      and the tasks assigned to its various elements should reflect the needs of the situation.
4.3. Levels of Airpower Doctrine.
      The Air Force places airpower doctrine at different levels and depths of detail in the forms of basic, operational, and
      tactical doctrine.
      4.3.1. Basic Doctrine.
            AFDD 1 is the Airman‘s basic doctrine. It states the most fundamental and enduring beliefs that describe and
            guide the proper use, presentation, and organization of Air Force capabilities in military action. It describes the
            ―elemental properties‖ of airpower and provides the Airman‘s perspective. Because of its fundamental and
            enduring character, basic doctrine provides broad and continuing guidance on how U.S. Air Force forces are
            organized, equipped, sustained, and employed. Because it expresses broad, enduring fundamentals, basic
            doctrine changes relatively slowly compared to the other levels of doctrine. As the foundation of all Air Force
            doctrine, basic doctrine also sets the tone and vision for doctrine development for the future.
      4.3.2. Operational Doctrine.
            Contained in AFDD X-0 series publications (AFDD 2-0, 3-0, 4-0, 6-0), operational doctrine describes more
            detailed organization of forces and applies the principles of basic doctrine to military actions. Operational
            doctrine guides the proper organization and employment of forces in the context of distinct objectives, force
            capabilities, broad functional areas, and operational environments. Operational doctrine provides the focus for
            developing the missions and tasks that must be executed through tactical doctrine.
      4.3.3. Tactical Doctrine.
            Tactical doctrine describes the proper employment of specific U.S. Air Force assets, individually or in concert
            with other assets, to accomplish detailed objectives. Tactical doctrine considers particular objectives and
            conditions and describes how Air Force assets are employed to accomplish the tactical objective. It is codified
            as tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) in Air Force TTP 3-series publications. Because tactical doctrine is
            closely associated with employment of technology and emerging tactics, change may occur more rapidly than to
            the other levels of doctrine.

4.4. Key Doctrine Concepts:
      4.4.1. The Airman’s Perspective.
            Because of the unique nature of Air Force forces, the perspective of Airmen is necessarily different; it reflects
            the range, speed, and capabilities of airpower, as well as threats and survival imperatives unique to Airmen. The
            study of airpower leads to a particular expertise and a distinctive point of view that General Henry H. (―Hap‖)
            Arnold termed ―airmindedness.‖ Airmindedness is much harder to convey than the perspectives of soldiers,
            sailors, and marines for several reasons. Their viewpoint—bounded by the apparent horizon—is part of
            everyday life and instinctive understanding. Yet few have ever operated an aircraft or contemplated the
            problems of aerial warfare, and few popular sources of information realistically reflect an Airman‘s perspective.
            4.4.1.1. Control of the vertical dimension is generally a necessary precondition for control of the surface. The
            first mission of an air force is to defeat or neutralize enemy air forces so friendly operations on land, sea, in the
            air, and in space can proceed unhindered, and to protect one‘s own military forces and critical vulnerabilities
            from air attack.
            4.4.1.2. Airpower is an inherently strategic force. War and peace are decided, organized, planned, supplied, and
            commanded at the strategic level of war. Airpower can hold an enemy‘s centers of gravity and critical
            vulnerabilities directly at risk immediately and continuously. Airpower also has great strategic capability for
            nonlethal strategic influence, as in humanitarian relief and security cooperation activities.
            4.4.1.3. Airpower can exploit the principles of mass and maneuver simultaneously to a far greater extent than
            surface forces are able. There are no natural lateral boundaries in the vertical environment to prevent Airmen
            from concentrating air, space, and cyberspace power at any point, and from doing so very quickly, even when
            starting from widely dispersed locations. Airpower dominates the fourth dimension—time—and compresses
            events to produce physical and psychological shock.
            4.4.1.4. Airpower can apply force against any facet of enemy power. Air Force-provided capabilities can be
            brought to bear on an enemy‘s diplomatic, informational, military, economic, and social structures
            simultaneously or separately. They can be employed in support of national, combined/joint, or other component
            objectives. They can be integrated with surface power or employed independently.
            4.4.1.5. Air Force forces are less culturally intrusive in many scenarios. Surface forces are composed of many
            people and vehicles which, when arrayed for operations, cover a significant area. Thus, their presence may be
            very visible to local populations and may create resentment during certain types of stability operations.
            Airpower, operating from bases over the horizon or from just a few bases in country, has a smaller footprint for
            the effects it provides.
            4.4.1.6. Airpower‘s inherent speed, range, and flexibility combine to make it the most versatile component of
            military power. Its versatility allows it to be rapidly employed against strategic, operational, and tactical
            objectives simultaneously. The versatility of airpower derives not only from the inherent characteristics of air
            forces themselves, but also from the manner in which they are organized and controlled.
            4.4.1.7. Airpower results from the effective integration of capabilities, people, weapons, bases, logistics, and all
            supporting infrastructure. No one aspect of air, space, and cyberspace capabilities should be treated in isolation
            because each element is essential and interdependent. Ultimately, airpower depends on the performance of the
            people who operate, command, and sustain air, space, and cyberspace forces.
            4.4.1.8. The choice of weapons is a key aspect in the realization of airpower. Weapons should be selected based
            on their ability to influence an adversary‘s capability and will. Achieving the full potential of airpower requires
            timely, actionable intelligence and sufficient command and control capabilities to permit commanders to exploit
            speed, range, flexibility, and versatility.
            4.4.1.9. Support bases, with their people, systems, and facilities, are essential to launch, recover, and sustain
            airpower. One of the most important characteristics of airpower has proved to be its ability to move anywhere in
            the world quickly, and then rapidly begin operations. However, the need for mobility should be balanced
            against the need to operate at the deployment site. The availability and operability of suitable bases can be the
            dominant factor in employment planning and execution.
            4.4.1.10. Airpower‘s unique characteristics necessitate that it be centrally controlled by Airmen. Airpower can
            quickly intervene anywhere, whether for strategic or tactical purposes. Thus, Airmen must take a broader view
            of war, because the weapons they command have effects at broader levels of war.

    4.4.2. Principles of War.
          Throughout the history of conflict, military leaders have noted certain principles that tended to produce military
          victory. From ancient times to the present, certain ―truths‖ of warfare have emerged. Known as the principles of
          war, they are ―those aspects of warfare that are universally true and relevant.‖ As members of the joint team,
          Airmen should appreciate how these principles apply to all forces, but must fully understand them as they
          pertain to Air Force forces.
          4.4.2.1. Unity of command ensures concentration of effort for every objective under one responsible
          commander. Airpower‘s operational-level perspective calls for unity of command to gain the most effective and
          efficient application. Coordination may be achieved by cooperation; it is, however, best achieved by vesting a
          single commander with the authority to direct all force employment in pursuit of a common objective. The
          essence of successful operations is a coordinated and cooperative effort toward a commonly understood
          objective. In many operations, the wide-ranging interagency and nongovernmental organization (NGO)
          operations involved may dilute unity of command; nevertheless, a unity of effort must be preserved to ensure
          common focus and mutually supporting actions. Unity of command is vital in employing airpower. Airpower is
          the product of multiple capabilities, and centralized control is essential to effectively fuse these capabilities.
          Airmen best understand the entire range of airpower. The ability of airpower to range on a theater and global
          scale imposes theater and global responsibilities that can be discharged only through the integrating function of
          centralized control under an Airman.
          4.4.2.2. Objective is the principle concerned with directing military operations toward a defined and attainable
          objective that contributes to strategic, operational, and tactical aims. In application, this principle refers to unity
          of effort. Success in military operations demands that all efforts be directed toward the achievement of tactical,
          operational, and ultimately, strategic, aims. In a broad sense, this principle holds that political and military goals
          should be complementary and clearly articulated. A clear statement of national objectives provides focus for
          defining campaign or theater objectives. At the operational level, campaign or theater objectives determine
          military priorities. It is important to consider the impact time and persistence have on attaining the objective.
          Short-term solutions to long-term problems must be avoided when defining force objectives. The objective is
          important due to the versatility of airpower. From the outset, airpower can pursue tactical, operational, or
          strategic objectives, in any combination, or all three simultaneously. From an Airman‘s perspective, then, the
          principle of objective shapes priorities to allow airpower to concentrate on theater or campaign priorities and
          seeks to avoid the siphoning of force elements to fragmented objectives.
          4.4.2.3. Offensive action is to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative. The offensive aim is to act rather than
          react, and dictates the time, place, purpose, scope, intensity, and pace of operations. The initiative must be
          seized as soon as possible. The principle of the offensive holds that offensive action, or initiative, provides the
          means for joint forces to dictate operations. Once seized, the initiative should be retained and fully exploited.
          This principle is particularly significant to airpower because it is best used as an offensive weapon. While
          defense may be dictated by the combat situation, success in war is generally attained only while on the
          offensive. Even such highly successful defensive air campaigns as the World War II Battle of Britain were
          based upon selective offensive engagements. Airpower is inherently offensive at the tactical level—even when
          employed in operational or strategic defense. History has generally shown that a well-planned and -executed air
          attack is extremely difficult to stop. The speed and range of attacking airpower forces gives it a significant
          offensive advantage over surface forces and even defending air forces. In an air attack, the defender often
          requires more forces to defend a given geospatial area than the attacker requires to strike a set of specific
          targets. Although all military forces have offensive capabilities, airpower‘s ability to mass and maneuver and its
          ability to operate independently or simultaneously at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels of warfare,
          provides JFCs a resource with global reach to directly and rapidly seize the initiative. Whether deploying forces
          and supplies into a region, conducting combat operations, or maintaining information assurance, airpower
          provides the JFC the means to take the offensive. From the beginning of an operation, airpower can seize the
          initiative by flying over enemy lines and around massed defenses to directly attack enemy capabilities. Through
          prompt and sustained offensive actions designed to attain operational and strategic objectives, airpower causes
          the enemy to react rather than act, deny them the offensive, and shapes the remainder of the conflict.
          4.4.2.4. Mass concentrates the effects of combat power at the most advantageous place and time to achieve
          decisive results. Concentration of military power is a fundamental consideration in all military operations. At
          the operational level, this principle suggests that superior, concentrated combat power is used to achieve
          decisive results. Airpower is singularly able to launch an attack from widely dispersed locations and mass
          combat power at the objective, whether that objective is a single physical location or a widely dispersed enemy
          system or systems. From an Airman‘s perspective, mass is not based solely on the quantity of forces and
72                                                                            1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
     materiel committed. Mass is an effect that airpower achieves through effectiveness of attack, not just
     overwhelming numbers. Contemporary airpower has altered the concept of massed forces. The speed, range,
     and flexibility of airpower—complemented by the accuracy and lethality of precision weapons and advances in
     information technologies—allow it to achieve mass faster than surface forces. In the past, hundreds of airplanes
     attacked one or two major targets each day. Massed bomber raids revisited targets often, intending their attacks
     to gradually attain cumulative operational- or strategic-level effects over time. Today, a single precision weapon
     that is targeted, based upon superior battlespace awareness, can often cause the destructive effect that took
     hundreds of bombs in the past. In an inversion of previous platform-to-target ratios, modern precision munitions
     now permit a single aircraft to confidently strike several targets.
     4.4.2.5. Maneuver places the enemy in a position of disadvantage through the flexible application of combat
     power in a multidimensional combat space. Airpower‘s ability to conduct maneuver is not only a product of its
     speed and range, but also flows from its flexibility and versatility during the planning and execution of
     operations. Maneuver, like the principle of offensive, forces the enemy to react, allowing the exploitation of
     successful friendly operations and reducing friendly vulnerabilities. The ability to quickly integrate a force and
     to strike directly at an adversary‘s strategic or operational centers of gravity is a key theme of airpower‘s
     maneuver advantage. Airpower maneuver allows engagement anywhere, from any direction, at any time,
     forcing the adversary to be on guard everywhere. Additionally, the principle of maneuver is not limited to
     simple weapons delivery. Airpower‘s global awareness, reach, and presence were instrumental in the rapid
     buildup of U.S. forces into Kuwait in 1994 that deterred Iraqi aggression against Kuwait. Whether it involves
     airlift or attack aircraft, in small or large numbers, the versatility and responsiveness of airpower allow the
     simultaneous application of mass and maneuver. Consider airlift operations such as Operation Support Hope in
     Rwanda, Operation Provide Hope in the former U.S.S.R., or Operation Provide Promise in Bosnia, or combat
     operations such as Operation Allied Force in Serbia, Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, or Operation
     Iraqi Freedom in Iraq. Airpower has played a critical role in American diplomacy by providing unmatched
     maneuverability.
     4.4.2.6. Economy of force is the judicious employment and distribution of forces. Its purpose is to allocate
     minimum essential resources to secondary efforts. This principle calls for the rational use of force by selecting
     the best mix of airpower. To ensure overwhelming combat power is available, maximum effort should be
     devoted to primary objectives. At the operational level, commanders must ensure that any effort made toward
     secondary objectives does not degrade achievement of the larger operational or strategic objectives. This
     principle requires Airmen to maintain a broader operational view even as they seek to obtain clearly articulated
     objectives and priorities. Economy of force may require a commander to establish a balance in the application
     of airpower between attacking, defending, delaying, or conducting deception operations, depending on the
     importance of the area or the priority of the objective or objectives. Also, priorities may shift rapidly; friendly
     troops in contact might drive a change in priority from one type of mission (interdiction) to another (close air
     support). Although this principle suggests the use of overwhelming force in one sense, it also recommends
     guarding against the ―overkill‖ inherent in the use of excessive force. This is particularly relevant when
     excessive force can prevent gaining or maintaining legitimacy and support for an operation. While this principle
     was well developed before the advent of airpower, it highlights precisely the greatest vulnerability of airpower
     employment. The misuse or misdirection of airpower can reduce its effectiveness even more than enemy action.
     Ill-defined objectives can result in the piecemeal application of air, space, and cyberspace forces with the
     resultant loss of decisive effects.
     4.4.2.7. Security’s purpose is never to permit the enemy to acquire unexpected advantage. Friendly forces and
     their operations should be protected from enemy action that could provide the enemy with unexpected
     advantage. The lethal consequences of enemy attack make the security of friendly forces a paramount concern.
     This principle also enhances our freedom of action by reducing the vulnerability of friendly forces. Gaining or
     maintaining the appropriate degree of control of the air, space, and cyberspace domains provides friendly forces
     a significant advantage. Airpower is most vulnerable on the ground. Thus, force protection is an integral part of
     airpower employment. Fixed bases are especially vulnerable as they not only must withstand aerial and ground
     attacks but also must sustain concentrated and prolonged air activities against the enemy. This should be a
     particular focus of operations during peace support or crisis situations, when forces may operate from austere
     and unimproved locations, in small units, or in crowded urban settings and face threats to security from
     individuals and groups as well as possible military or paramilitary units. Security also may be obtained by
     staying beyond the enemy‘s reach. Airpower is uniquely suited to capitalize on this through its ability to operate
     over the horizon. Not only can airpower reach and strike at extended range, but it also can distribute data and
     analysis as well as command and control across a worldwide span. Security from enemy intrusion conceals our
     capabilities and intentions, while allowing friendly forces the freedom to gather information on the adversary—
AFPAM36-2241     1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                            73

          the type of information that creates the opportunity to strike the enemy where they will least expect it. Critical
          to security is the understanding that security embraces physical security and security of the information
          environment. Information has always been part of air, land, and sea warfare; now, with the proliferation of
          advanced communications and computer technologies, it becomes even more central to the outcome of a
          conflict.
          4.4.2.8. Surprise leverages the security principle by attacking the enemy at a time, place, or in a manner for
          which they are not prepared. The speed and range of airpower, coupled with its flexibility and versatility, allow
          air forces to achieve surprise more readily than surface forces. The final choice of timing and tactics rests with
          the air component commander because terrain and distance are not inhibiting factors. Airpower can enhance and
          empower surface forces to achieve surprise. The rapid global reach of airpower also allows surface forces to
          reach foreign destinations quickly, thus seizing the initiative through surprise.
          4.4.2.9. Simplicity calls for avoiding unnecessary complexity in organizing, preparing, planning, and
          conducting military operations. This ensures that guidance, plans, and orders are as simple and direct as the
          objective will allow. Simple guidance allows subordinate commanders the freedom to operate creatively within
          their battlespace. Common equipment, a common understanding of service and joint doctrine, and familiarity
          with procedures through joint exercises and training, can help overcome complexity. Straightforward plans and
          unambiguous organizational and command relationships are central to reducing it.
    4.4.3. Tenets of Airpower.
          The application of airpower is refined by several fundamental guiding truths known as tenets. They reflect not
          only the unique historical and doctrinal evolution of airpower, but also the specific current understanding of the
          nature of airpower. The tenets of airpower complement the principles of war. While the principles of war
          provide general guidance on the application of military forces, the tenets provide more specific considerations
          for the employment of air, space, and cyberspace capabilities. They reflect the specific lessons of airpower
          capabilities throughout history. The tenets of airpower employment are interconnected, overlapping, and often
          interlocking. The oldest tenet of airpower—centralized control and decentralized execution—remains the
          keystone of success in modern warfare. As with the principles of war, these tenets require informed judgment in
          application. They require a skillful blending to tailor them to the ever-changing operational environment. The
          competing demands of the principles and tenets (for example, mass versus economy of force, concentration
          versus balance, and priority versus objective) require an Airman‘s expert understanding in order to strike the
          required balance. In the last analysis, commanders must accept the fact that war is incredibly complicated, and
          no two operations are identical. Commanders must apply their professional judgment and experience to the
          principles and tenets as they employ airpower in a given situation.
          4.4.3.1. Centralized Control and Decentralized Execution. Centralized control and decentralized execution
          of airpower are critical to effective employment. Indeed, they are the fundamental organizing principles for
          airpower, having been proven over decades of experience as the most effective and efficient means of
          employing it. Because of airpower‘s unique potential to directly affect the strategic and operational levels of
          war, it should be controlled by a single Airman who maintains the broad, strategic perspective necessary to
          balance and prioritize the use of a powerful, highly desired yet limited, force. Decentralized execution is the
          delegation of authority to designated lower-level commanders and other tactical-level decision makers to
          achieve effective span of control and to foster disciplined initiative, situational responsiveness, and tactical
          flexibility. It allows subordinates to exploit opportunities in rapidly changing, fluid situations. Centralized
          control and decentralized execution of airpower provide theater-wide or global focus while allowing operational
          flexibility to meet military objectives. They assure concentration of effort while maintaining economy of force.
          They exploit airpower‘s versatility and flexibility to ensure that airpower capabilities remain responsive,
          survivable, and sustainable. Execution should be decentralized within a command and control architecture that
          exploits the ability of front-line decision makers (such as strike package leaders, air battle managers, and
          forward air controllers) to make on-scene decisions during complex, rapidly unfolding operations. Modern
          communications technology enhances centralized knowledge and may lead to increasingly centralized
          execution of airpower. Although several recent operations have employed some degree of centralized execution,
          such command arrangements will not stand up in a fully stressed, dynamic combat environment, and should not
          become the norm for all air operations. Despite impressive gains in data exploitation and automated decision
          aids, one person cannot achieve and maintain detailed situational awareness when fighting a conflict involving
          many simultaneous engagements taking place throughout a large area. A high level of centralized execution
          results in a rigid campaign unresponsive to local conditions and lacking in tactical flexibility. In some situations
          there may be valid reasons for control of specific operations at higher levels, most notably when the JFC (or
          perhaps even higher authorities) may wish to control strategic effects even at the sacrifice of tactical efficiency.
74                                                                             1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
     Such instances should be rare, as in short-notice prosecution of high-value, time-sensitive targets, when political
     sensitivities require tighter control over selected missions, when potential exists for collateral damage or
     mistargeting, or in the case of nuclear employment. In all cases, senior commanders balance overall campaign
     execution against the pressing need for tactical effectiveness. Subordinate decisions that support the superior
     commander‘s intent and meet campaign objectives should be allowed and executed.
     4.4.3.2. Flexibility and Versatility. Although often used interchangeably, flexibility and versatility are
     different. Flexibility allows airpower to exploit mass and maneuver simultaneously. Flexibility allows airpower
     operations to shift from one campaign objective to another, quickly and decisively; to ―go downtown‖ on one
     sortie, then hit fielded enemy forces the next; to re-role assets quickly from a preplanned mission to support an
     unanticipated need for close air support of friendly troops in contact with enemy forces. Versatility is the ability
     to employ airpower effectively at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of warfare and provide a wide
     variety of tasks in concert with other joint force elements. Airpower, unlike other military forces, has the
     potential to achieve this unmatched synergy through asymmetric and parallel operations.
     4.4.3.3. Synergistic Effects. The proper application of a coordinated force can produce effects that exceed the
     contributions of forces employed individually. The destruction of a large number of targets through attrition
     warfare is rarely the key objective in modern war. Instead, the objective is the precise, coordinated application
     of the various elements of airpower and surface power to bring disproportionate pressure on enemy leaders to
     comply with our national will. Airpower‘s overwhelming ability to observe adversaries allows JFCs to counter
     enemy movements with unprecedented speed and agility. Airpower is unique in its ability to dictate the tempo
     and direction of an entire war-fighting effort regardless of the scale of the operation.
     4.4.3.4. Persistence. Air, space, and cyberspace operations may be conducted continuously against a broad
     spectrum of targets. Airpower‘s exceptional speed and range allow its forces to visit and revisit wide ranges of
     targets nearly at will. Airpower does not have to occupy terrain or remain constantly in proximity to areas of
     operation to bring force upon targets. Space forces in particular hold the ultimate high ground, and as space
     systems advance and proliferate, they offer the potential for persistent overhead access; unmanned aircraft
     systems are offering similar possibilities within the atmosphere. Examples of persistent operations might be
     maintaining a continuous flow of materiel to peacetime distressed areas; constantly monitoring adversaries to
     ensure they cannot conduct actions counter to those agreed upon; assuring that targets are kept continually out
     of commission; or ensuring that resources and facilities are denied an enemy or provided to an ally during a
     specified time. The end result would be to deny the opponent an opportunity to seize the initiative and to
     directly accomplish assigned tasks. Factors such as enemy resilience, effective defenses, or environmental
     concerns may prevent commanders from quickly attaining their objectives. However, for many situations, air,
     space, and cyberspace provide the most effective means to attain national objectives. Commanders should keep
     their eye on achieving strategic and operational objectives, and resist pressures to divert resources to other
     efforts unless such diversions are vital to attaining theater goals or to the survival of an element of the joint
     force. Given sufficient time, even the most devastating strategic effects can be circumvented by resourceful
     enemies; the goal is to keep pressure on and not allow the enemy that time.
     4.4.3.5. Concentration. One of the most constant and important trends throughout military history has been the
     effort to concentrate overwhelming power at the decisive time and place. The principles of mass and economy
     of force deal directly with concentrating overwhelming power at the right time and the right place (or places).
     The versatility of airpower makes it an attractive option for almost every combat task. With capabilities as
     flexible and versatile as air, space, and cyberspace forces, the demand for them will often exceed the available
     forces and may result in the fragmentation of the integrated airpower effort in attempts to fulfill the many
     demands of the operation. Depending on the operational situation, such a course of action may court the triple
     risk of failing to achieve operational-level objectives, delaying or diminishing the attainment of decisive effects,
     and increasing the attrition rate of air forces—consequently risking defeat. Airmen must guard against the
     inadvertent dilution of airpower effects resulting from high demand.
     4.4.3.6. Priority. Commanders should establish clear priorities for the use of airpower. Due to its inherent
     flexibility, the demands for airpower may likely exceed available resources. If commanders fail to establish
     priorities, they can become overwhelmed. Only commanders of land and naval components can effectively
     prioritize their requirements for coordinated airpower effects to the JFC, and only then can effective priorities
     for the use of airpower flow from an informed dialogue between the JFC and the air component commander.
     The air component commander should assess the possible uses of his or her forces and their strengths and
     capabilities to support the overall joint campaign, air, space, and cyberspace operations, and the battle at hand.
     Limited resources require that airpower be applied where it can make the greatest contribution to the most
     critical current JFC requirements. The application of airpower should be balanced among its ability to conduct
AFPAM36-2241     1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                             75

          operations at all levels of war, often simultaneously. The principles of mass, offensive, and economy of force;
          the tenet of concentration; and the Airman‘s strategic perspective all apply to prioritizing airpower.
          4.4.3.7. Balance. Balance is an essential guideline for air component commanders. Much of the skill of an air
          component commander is reflected in the dynamic and correct balancing of the principles of war and the tenets
          of airpower to bring Air Force capabilities together to produce a synergistic effect. An air component
          commander should balance combat opportunity, necessity, effectiveness, efficiency, and the impact on
          accomplishing assigned objectives against the associated risk to friendly airpower forces. An Airman is
          uniquely—and best—suited to determine the proper theater-wide balance between offensive and defensive
          operations, and among strategic, operational, and tactical applications. Commensurate with this capability is the
          air component commander‘s responsibility to communicate adequately the intended effects of airpower to the
          JFC and other component commanders, especially those schooled in surface operations. Technologically
          sophisticated air, space, and cyberspace assets will be available only in finite numbers; thus, balance is a crucial
          determinant for an air component commander.
    4.4.4. Air Force Functions:
          In order to describe what airpower in general, and the Air Force in particular, bring to the Nation, Airmen
          should first understand the distinctions among roles, missions, and functions. Although these terms are
          frequently used interchangeably, each has a specific meaning. In brief, the primary function of the Services is to
          organize, train, equip and administer military Service forces to perform a role—to be provided to and employed
          by a CCDR in the accomplishment of a mission to achieve a specific effect. Based upon the effect desired and
          the mission assigned, Airmen accomplish a series of discrete tasks that cumulatively deliver the desired effects.
          4.4.4.1. Roles. Roles are the broad and enduring purposes for which the Services were established by law. The
          role of the Air Force is to organize, train, and equip aviation forces ―primarily for prompt and sustained
          offensive and defensive air operations‖ (National Security Act, 1947). This basic charter has essentially
          remained unchanged to the present.
          4.4.4.2. Missions. Missions are the tasks assigned by the President or SECDEF to the CCDRs. CCDRs take
          these assigned tasks and develop mission statements, operational objectives, and concepts of operations; they
          then assign specific tasks to subordinate commanders. By tailoring these tasks to meet the commander‘s
          guidance and desired objectives, Air Force component commanders then develop component mission
          statements, objectives, and concepts of operations at their level.
          4.4.4.3. Functions. The functions of the Military Departments are those specific responsibilities that enable the
          Services to fulfill their legally established roles. The Air Force functions are based on the statutory
          responsibilities outlined in 10 U.S.C., which are known as ―organize, train, and equip‖ activities. Specifically,
          these include ―recruiting; organizing; supplying; equipping; training; servicing; mobilizing; demobilizing;
          administering (including the morale and welfare of personnel); maintaining; the construction, outfitting, and
          repair of military equipment; and the construction, maintenance, and repair of buildings, structures, and utilities;
          the acquisition, management and disposal; and the management of real property or natural resources‖ (DoDD
          5100.01, Functions of the Department of Defense and its Major Components).
          4.4.4.4. Core Functions. Recently the Air Force refined its understanding of the core duties and responsibilities
          it performs as a Service, streamlining what previously were 6 distinctive capabilities and 17 operational
          functions into 12 core functions to be used across the doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and
          education, personnel, and facilities spectrum. These core functions express the ways in which the Air Force is
          particularly and appropriately suited to contribute to national security, but they do not necessarily express every
          aspect of what the Air Force contributes to the Nation. It should be emphasized that the core functions, by
          themselves, are not doctrinal constructs.
          4.4.4.4.1. Nuclear Deterrence Operations (NDO). The purpose of Nuclear Deterrence Operations is to
          operate, maintain, and secure nuclear forces to achieve an assured capability to deter an adversary from taking
          action against vital U.S. interests. In the event deterrence fails, the United States should be able to appropriately
          respond with nuclear options. The subelements of this function are:
          4.4.4.4.1.1. Assure/Dissuade/Deter. This is a mission set derived from the Air Force‘s readiness to carry out
          the nuclear strike operations mission as well as from specific actions taken to assure allies as a part of extended
          deterrence. Dissuading others from acquiring or proliferating weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and the
          means to deliver them, contributes to promoting security and is also an integral part of this mission. Moreover,
          different deterrence strategies are required to deter various adversaries, whether they are a nation state, or
          nonstate/transnational actor. The Air Force maintains and presents credible deterrent capabilities through
76                                                                              1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
     successful visible demonstrations and exercises which assure allies, dissuade proliferation, deter potential
     adversaries from actions that threaten U.S. national security or the populations and deployed military forces of
     the United States, its allies, and friends.
     4.4.4.4.1.2. Nuclear Strike. Nuclear strike is the ability of nuclear forces to rapidly and accurately strike targets
     which the enemy holds dear in a devastating manner. If a crisis occurs, rapid generation and, if necessary,
     deployment of nuclear strike capabilities will demonstrate U.S. resolve and may prompt an adversary to alter
     the course of action deemed threatening to our national interest. Should deterrence fail, the President may
     authorize a precise, tailored response to terminate the conflict at the lowest possible level and lead to a rapid
     cessation of hostilities. Post-conflict, regeneration of a credible nuclear deterrent capability will deter further
     aggression. The Air Force may present a credible force posture in either the continental United States, within a
     theater of operations, or both to effectively deter the range of potential adversaries envisioned in the 21st
     Century. This requires the ability to engage targets globally using a variety of methods; therefore, the Air Force
     should possess the ability to induct, train, assign, educate and exercise individuals and units to rapidly and
     effectively execute missions that support U.S. NDO objectives. Finally, the Air Force regularly exercises and
     evaluates all aspects of nuclear operations to ensure high levels of performance.
     4.4.4.4.1.3. Nuclear Surety. Nuclear surety ensures the safety, security and effectiveness of nuclear operations.
     Because of their political and military importance, destructive power, and the potential consequences of an
     accident or unauthorized act, nuclear weapons and nuclear weapon systems require special consideration and
     protection against risks and threats inherent in their peacetime and wartime environments. The Air Force, in
     conjunction with other entities within the Departments of Defense or Energy, achieves a high standard of
     protection through a stringent nuclear surety program. This program applies to materiel, personnel, and
     procedures that contribute to the safety, security, and control of nuclear weapons, thus assuring no nuclear
     accidents, incidents, loss, or unauthorized or accidental use. The Air Force continues to pursue safe, secure, and
     effective nuclear weapons consistent with operational requirements. Adversaries, allies, and the American
     people must be highly confident of the Air Force‘s ability to secure nuclear weapons from accidents, theft, loss,
     and accidental or unauthorized use. This day-to-day commitment to precise and reliable nuclear operations is
     the cornerstone of the credibility of the NDO mission. Positive nuclear command, control, communications;
     effective nuclear weapons security; and robust combat support are essential to the overall NDO function.
     4.4.4.4.2. Air Superiority. Air superiority is that degree of dominance in the air battle of one force over another
     which permits the conduct of operations by the former and its related land, sea, air, and special operations
     forces at a given time and place without prohibitive interference by the opposing force (JP 1-02). The
     subelements of this function are:
     4.4.4.4.2.1. Offensive Counterair (OCA). Offensive Counterair is defined as offensive operations to destroy,
     disrupt, or neutralize enemy aircraft, missiles, launch platforms, and their supporting structures and systems
     both before and after launch, but as close to their source as possible (JP 1-02). OCA is the preferred method of
     countering air and missile threats because it attempts to defeat the enemy closer to its source and typically
     enjoys the initiative. OCA comprises attack operations, sweep, escort, and suppression/destruction of enemy air
     defense.
     4.4.4.4.2.2. Defensive Counterair (DCA). Defensive Counterair is defined as all the defensive measures
     designed to detect, identify, intercept, and destroy or negate enemy forces attempting to penetrate or attack
     through friendly airspace (JP 1-02). A major goal of DCA operations, in concert with OCA operations, is to
     provide an area from which forces can operate, secure from air and missile threats. The DCA mission comprises
     both active and passive defense measures. Active defense is the employment of limited offensive action and
     counterattacks to deny a contested area or position to the enemy (JP 1-02). It includes both ballistic missile
     defense and air breathing threat defense, and encompasses point defense, area defense, and high value airborne
     asset defense. Passive defense is measures taken to reduce the probability of and to minimize the effects of
     damage caused by hostile action without the intention of taking the initiative (JP 1-02). It includes detection and
     warning; chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear defense; camouflage, concealment, and deception;
     hardening; reconstitution; dispersion; redundancy; and mobility, countermeasures, and stealth.
     4.4.4.4.2.3. Airspace Control. Airspace control is a process used to increase operational effectiveness by
     promoting the safe, efficient, and flexible use of airspace (JP 1-02). It promotes the safe, efficient, and flexible
     use of airspace, mitigates the risk of fratricide, enhances both offensive and defensive operations, and permits
     greater agility of air operations as a whole. It both deconflicts and facilitates integration of joint air operations.
     4.4.4.4.3. Space Superiority. Space superiority is the degree of dominance in space of one force over another
     that permits the conduct of operations by the former and its related land, sea, air, space, and special operations
AFPAM36-2241    1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                            77

         forces at a given time and place without prohibitive interference by the opposing force (JP 1-02). Space
         superiority may be localized in time and space, or it may be broad and enduring. Space superiority provides
         freedom of action in space for friendly forces and, when directed, denies the same freedom to the adversary.
         The subelements of this function are:
         4.4.4.4.3.1. Space Force Enhancement. Space force enhancement is defined as the combat support operations
         and force-multiplying capabilities delivered from space systems to improve the effectiveness of military forces
         as well as support other intelligence, civil, and commercial users. This mission area includes: intelligence,
         surveillance, and reconnaissance; integrated tactical warning and attack assessment; command, control, and
         communications; positioning, navigation, and timing; and environmental monitoring (JP 1-02).
         4.4.4.4.3.2. Space Force Application. Space force application is defined as combat operations in, through, and
         from space to influence the course and outcome of conflict. This mission area includes ballistic missile defense
         and force projection (JP 1-02).
         4.4.4.4.3.3. Space Control. Space control is defined as operations to ensure freedom of action in space for the
         United States and its allies and, when directed, deny an adversary freedom of action in space. This mission area
         includes: operations conducted to protect friendly space capabilities from attack, interference, or unintentional
         hazards (defensive space control); operations to deny an adversary‘s use of space capabilities (offensive space
         control); and the requisite current and predictive knowledge of the space environment and the operational
         environment upon which space operations depend (space situational awareness) (JP 1-02).
         4.4.4.4.4. Cyberspace Superiority. Cyberspace superiority is the operational advantage in, through, and from
         cyberspace to conduct operations at a given time and in a given domain without prohibitive interference (AFDD
         3-12, Cyberspace Operations). The subelements of this function are:
         4.4.4.4.4.1. Cyberspace Force Application. Cyberspace force application is combat operations in, through, and
         from cyberspace to achieve military objectives and influence the course and outcome of conflict by taking
         decisive actions against approved targets. It will incorporate computer network attack (CNA), computer
         network exploitation (CNE), and may involve aspects of influence operations. It is highly dependent on ISR,
         fused all-source intelligence, sophisticated attribution activities, situational awareness, and responsive command
         and control (C2).
         4.4.4.4.4.2. Cyberspace Defense. This is the passive, active, and dynamic employment of capabilities to
         respond to imminent or ongoing actions against Air Force or Air Force-protected networks, the Air Force‘s
         portion of the Global Information Grid, or expeditionary communications assigned to the Air Force. Cyberspace
         defense incorporates CNE, computer network defense (CND), and CNA techniques and may be a contributor to
         influence operations. It is highly dependent upon ISR, fused all-source intelligence, automated indications and
         warning, sophisticated attribution/characterization, situational awareness, assessment, and responsive C2.
         4.4.4.4.4.3. Cyberspace Support. Cyberspace support is foundational, continuous, or responsive operations
         ensuring information integrity and availability in, through, and from Air Force-controlled infrastructure and its
         interconnected analog and digital portion of the battle space. Inherent in this mission is the ability to establish,
         extend, secure, protect, and defend in order to sustain assigned networks and missions. This includes protection
         measures against supply chain components plus critical C2 networks/communications links and nuclear C2
         networks. The cyberspace support mission incorporates CNE and CND techniques. It incorporates all elements
         of Air Force network operations, information transport, enterprise management, and information assurance, and
         is dependent on ISR and all-source intelligence.
         4.4.4.4.5. Command and Control (C2). Command and Control is the exercise of authority and direction by a
         properly designated commander over assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission. C2
         functions are performed through an arrangement of personnel, equipment, communications, facilities, and
         procedures employed by a commander in planning, directing, coordinating, and controlling forces and
         operations in the accomplishment of the mission (JP 1-02). This core function includes all of the C2-related
         capabilities and activities associated with air, space, cyberspace, nuclear, and agile combat support operations to
         achieve strategic, operational, and tactical objectives.
         4.4.4.4.5.1. Strategic Level C2. At this level, the United States determines national or multinational security
         objectives and guidance, and develops and uses national resources to accomplish these objectives. These
         national objectives in turn provide the direction for developing overall military objectives, which are used to
         develop the objectives and strategy for each theater.
78                                                                             1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
     4.4.4.4.5.2. Operational Level C2. At this level of war, campaigns and major operations are planned,
     conducted, sustained, and assessed to accomplish strategic goals within theaters or areas of operations. These
     activities imply a broader dimension of time or space than do tactics; they provide the means by which tactical
     successes are exploited to achieve strategic and operational objectives.
     4.4.4.4.5.3. Tactical Level C2. This is the level of war where individual battles and engagements are fought.
     The tactical level of war deals with how forces are employed, and the specifics of how engagements are
     conducted and targets attacked. The goal of tactical level C2 is to achieve a commander‘s intent and desired
     effects by gaining and keeping offensive initiative.
     4.4.4.4.6. Global Integrated ISR. Global integrated ISR is the synchronization and integration of the planning
     and operation of sensors, assets, and processing, exploitation, dissemination systems across the globe to conduct
     current and future operations. The subelements of this function are:
     4.4.4.4.6.1. Planning and Directing. This is the determination of intelligence requirements, development of
     appropriate intelligence architecture, preparation of a collection plan, and issuance of orders and requests to
     information collection agencies (JP 2-01, Joint and National Intelligence Support to Military Operations).
     These activities enable the synchronization and integration of collection, processing, exploitation, analysis, and
     dissemination activities/resources to meet information requirements of national and military decision makers.
     4.4.4.4.6.2. Collection. Collection is the acquisition of information and the provision of this information to
     processing elements (JP 2-01). It provides the ability to obtain required information to satisfy intelligence needs
     (via use of sources and methods in all domains). Collection activities span the Range Of Military Operations
     (ROMO).
     4.4.4.4.6.3. Processing and Exploitation. Processing and exploitation is the conversion of collected
     information into forms suitable to the production of intelligence (JP 2-01). It provides the ability, across the
     ROMO, to transform, extract, and make available collected information suitable for further analysis or action.
     4.4.4.4.6.4. Analysis and Production. Analysis and production is the conversion of processed information into
     intelligence through the integration, evaluation, analysis, and interpretation of all source data and the
     preparation of intelligence products in support of known or anticipated user requirements (JP 2-01). It provides
     the ability to integrate, evaluate, and interpret information from available sources to create a finished
     intelligence product for presentation or dissemination to enable increased situational awareness.
     4.4.4.4.6.5. Dissemination and Integration. This is the delivery of intelligence to users in a suitable form and
     the application of the intelligence to appropriate missions, tasks, and functions (JP 2-01). It provides the ability
     to present information and intelligence products across the ROMO enabling understanding of the operational
     environment to military and national decision makers.
     4.4.4.4.7. Global Precision Attack. Global precision attack is the ability to hold at risk or strike rapidly and
     persistently, with a wide range of munitions, any target and to create swift, decisive, and precise effects across
     multiple domains. The subelements of this function are:
     4.4.4.4.7.1. Strategic Attack. Strategic attack is defined as offensive action specifically selected to achieve
     national strategic objectives. These attacks seek to weaken the adversary‘s ability or will to engage in conflict,
     and may achieve strategic objectives without necessarily having to achieve operational objectives as a
     precondition (AFDD 3-70, Strategic Attack).
     4.4.4.4.7.2. Air Interdiction. Air interdiction is defined as air operations conducted to divert, disrupt, delay, or
     destroy the enemy's military potential before it can be brought to bear effectively against friendly forces, or to
     otherwise achieve JFC objectives. Air lnterdiction is conducted at such distance from friendly forces that
     detailed integration of each air mission with the fire and movement of friendly forces is not required (AFDD 3-
     03, Counterland Operations).
     4.4.4.4.7.3. Close Air Support. Close air support is defined as air action by fixed- and rotary-winged aircraft
     against hostile targets that are in close proximity to friendly forces and which require detailed integration of
     each air mission with the fire and movement of those forces (JP 1-02). This can be as a pre-planned event or on
     demand from an alert posture (ground or airborne). It can be conducted across the ROMO.
     4.4.4.4.8. Special Operations. Special operations are operations conducted in hostile, denied, or politically
     sensitive environments to achieve military, diplomatic, informational, and/or economic objectives employing
     military capabilities for which there is no broad conventional force requirement. These operations may require
     covert, clandestine, or low-visibility capabilities. Special operations are applicable across the ROMO. They can
     be conducted independently or in conjunction with operations of conventional forces or other government
AFPAM36-2241    1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                              79

         agencies and may include operations through, with, or by indigenous or surrogate forces. Special operations
         differ from conventional operations in degree of physical and political risk, operational techniques, mode of
         employment, independence from friendly support, and dependence on detailed operational intelligence and
         indigenous assets (JP 1-02). The subelements of this function are:
         4.4.4.4.8.1. Agile Combat Support. This is the capability to effectively create, prepare, deploy, employ,
         sustain, and protect Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) Airmen, assets, and capabilities
         throughout the ROMO at a chosen initiative, speed, and tempo.
         4.4.4.4.8.2. Aviation Foreign Internal Defense. These operations directly execute U.S. security and foreign
         policy as lead airpower elements that shape the battlefield and conduct stability operations to enable global
         reach and strike. This is accomplished by applying the mission set (assess, train, advise, and assist foreign
         aviation forces) across a continuum of operating venues described as indirect assistance, direct assistance (not
         including combat) and combat operations.
         4.4.4.4.8.3. Battlefield Air Operations. This is a unique set of combat proven capabilities (combat control,
         pararescue, combat weather, and tactical air control party) provided by regular and reserve component special
         operations forces (SOF) Battlefield Airmen who integrate, synchronize, and control manned and unmanned
         capabilities to achieve tactical, operational, and strategic objectives.
         4.4.4.4.8.4. Command and Control (C2). This is the exercise of the commander‘s authority and direction over
         assigned and attached forces by trained, organized, and equipped C2 elements. Operational C2 elements consist
         of personnel and equipment with specialized capability to plan, direct, coordinate, and control forces in the
         conduct of joint/combined special operations.
         4.4.4.4.8.5. Information Operations. This mission is the integrated employment of the capabilities of influence
         operations, electronic warfare operations, and network warfare operations, in concert with specified integrated
         control enablers, to influence, disrupt, corrupt, or usurp adversarial human and automated decisionmaking while
         protecting one‘s own.
         4.4.4.4.8.6. Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR). This is the synchronization and integration
         of platforms and sensors with the planning and direction, collection, processing and exploitation, analysis, and
         production and dissemination processes. These activities provide actionable intelligence, weather,
         environmental awareness, and prediction across all SOF command echelons.
         4.4.4.4.8.7. Military Information Support Operations. These are planned operations to convey selected
         information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and
         ultimately the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and individuals. The purpose of military
         information support operations is to induce or reinforce foreign attitudes and behavior favorable to the
         originator‘s objectives.
         4.4.4.4.8.8. Precision Strike. This mission provides combatant commanders with an integrated capability to
         find, fix, track, target, engage, and assess targets using a single weapons system or a combination of systems.
         This includes close air support, air interdiction, and armed reconnaissance missions.
         4.4.4.4.8.9. Specialized Air Mobility. This is the conduct of rapid, global infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply
         of personnel, equipment, and materiel using specialized systems and tactics. These missions may be clandestine,
         low visibility, or overt and through hostile, denied, or politically sensitive airspace.
         4.4.4.4.8.10. Specialized Refueling. This is the conduct of rapid, global refueling using specialized systems and
         tactics. This includes aerial refueling of vertical lift aircraft and ground refueling during forward arming and
         refueling point operations. These missions may be clandestine, low visibility, or overt and in hostile, denied, or
         politically sensitive environments.
         4.4.4.4.9. Rapid Global Mobility. Rapid global mobility is the timely deployment, employment, sustainment,
         augmentation, and redeployment of military forces and capabilities across the ROMO. It provides joint military
         forces the capability to move from place to place while retaining the ability to fulfill their primary mission.
         Rapid global mobility is essential to virtually every military operation, allowing forces to reach foreign or
         domestic destinations quickly, thus seizing the initiative through speed and surprise. The subelements of this
         function are:
         4.4.4.4.9.1. Airlift. Airlift is operations to transport and deliver forces and materiel through the air in support of
         strategic, operational, or tactical objectives (AFDD 3-17, Air Mobility Operations). The rapid and flexible
         options afforded by airlift allow military forces and national leaders the ability to respond and operate in a
80                                                                              1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
     variety of situations and time frames. The global reach capability of airlift provides the ability to apply U.S.
     power worldwide by delivering forces to crisis locations. It serves as a U.S. presence that demonstrates resolve
     and compassion in humanitarian crisis.
     4.4.4.4.9.2. Air Refueling. Air refueling is the refueling of an aircraft in flight by another aircraft (JP 1-02). Air
     refueling extends presence, increases range, and serves as a force multiplier. It allows air assets to more rapidly
     reach any trouble spot around the world with less dependence on forward staging bases or overflight/landing
     clearances. Air refueling significantly expands the options available to a commander by increasing the range,
     payload, persistence, and flexibility of receiver aircraft.
     4.4.4.4.9.3. Aeromedical Evacuation. Aeromedical evacuation is the movement of patients under medical
     supervision to and between medical treatment facilities by air transportation (JP 1-02). JP 4-02, Health Service
     Support, further defines it as the fixed wing movement of regulated casualties to and between medical treatment
     facilities, using organic and/or contracted mobility airframes, with aircrew trained explicitly for this mission.
     Aeromedical evacuation forces can operate as far forward as fixed-wing aircraft are able to conduct airland
     operations.
     4.4.4.4.10. Personnel Recovery (PR). Personnel Recovery is the sum of military, diplomatic, and civil efforts
     to prepare for and execute the recovery and reintegration of isolated personnel (JP 1-02). It is the ability of the
     U.S. government and its international partners to affect the recovery of isolated personnel across the ROMO and
     return those personnel to duty. PR also enhances the development of an effective, global capacity to protect and
     recover isolated personnel wherever they are placed at risk; deny an adversary‘s ability to exploit a nation
     through propaganda; and develop joint, interagency, and international capabilities that contribute to crisis
     response and regional stability. The subelements of this function are:
     4.4.4.4.10.1. Combat Search and Rescue. This is the tactics, techniques, and procedures performed by forces
     to effect the recovery of isolated personnel during combat (JP 1-02). Combat search and rescue is the primary
     Air Force recovery method used to conduct PR taskings.
     4.4.4.4.10.2. Civil Search and Rescue. This is the use of aircraft, surface craft, submarines, and specialized
     rescue teams and equipment to search for and rescue distressed persons on land or at sea in a permissive
     environment (JP 1-02).
     4.4.4.4.10.3. Disaster Response. Disaster response is the capability to support and assist U.S. government
     agencies and embassies during national and international disasters with rapidly deployable and flexible
     air/ground rescue forces.
     4.4.4.4.10.4. Humanitarian Assistance Operations. These are programs conducted to relieve or reduce the
     results of natural or manmade disasters or other endemic conditions such as human pain, disease, hunger, or
     privation that might present a serious threat to life or that can result in great damage to or loss of property.
     Humanitarian assistance provided by U.S. forces is limited in scope and duration. The assistance provided is
     designed to supplement or complement the efforts of the host nation civil authorities or agencies that may have
     the primary responsibility for providing humanitarian assistance (JP 1-02).
     4.4.4.4.10.5. Medical Evacuation/Casualty Evacuation. Medical evacuation refers to dedicated medical
     evacuation platforms staffed and equipped to provide en route medical care using predesignated tactical and
     logistic aircraft, boats, ships, and other watercraft temporarily equipped and staffed with medical attendants for
     en route care. Casualty evacuation involves the unregulated movement of casualties aboard ships, land vehicles,
     or aircraft (JP 4-02).
     4.4.4.4.11. Agile Combat Support (ACS). Agile Combat Support is the ability to field, protect, and sustain Air
     Force forces across the ROMO to achieve joint effects. The subelements of this function are:
     4.4.4.4.11.1. Ready the Total Force. Mission elements include: organizing, training, and equipping forces;
     establishing quality of life and maintaining core security; and fielding and planning for the use of operational
     and support forces to meet global mission requirements.
     4.4.4.4.11.2. Prepare the Battlespace. Mission elements include: assessing, planning, and posturing for rapid
     employment; prepositioning resources and conditioning specific theaters and/or contingency locations in a
     manner to meet closure timing; and establishing sustainment levels for potential operations.
     4.4.4.4.11.3. Position the Total Force. Mission elements include: preparing to deploy, deploying, receiving,
     and bedding down tailored and prioritized forces; establishing initial operations and support cadres in a joint
     operations area; distributing prepositioned resources; establishing initial reachback connectivity; securing
     operating locations; and preparing for mission operations.
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                           81

            4.4.4.4.11.4. Protect the Total Force. Protecting the Total Force key focus areas include personnel, critical
            assets, and information. These areas are the persistent detection and understanding of threats in the operational
            environment and the timely dissemination of accurate decisions, warnings, and taskings to protect against
            attacks and/or threats.
            4.4.4.4.11.5. Employ Combat Support Forces. Mission elements include: engaging support forces in support
            of mission operations; initializing, launching, recovering, and regenerating operational elements; executing
            support through supporting-supported relationships; and commencing reachback operations to strategic levels of
            support.
            4.4.4.4.11.6. Sustain the Total Force. Mission elements include: producing assured capacities and levels of
            support; and accomplishing the long-term mastery of an operational environment (peacetime and wartime)
            requiring persistent and effective materiel and personnel support through both local and reachback processes.
            4.4.4.4.11.7. Recover the Total Force. Mission elements include: preparing forces to remain in place,
            redeploy, relocate, and be reconstituted to prescribed levels of readiness; restoring operating locations and/or
            environments to planned conditions; protecting the dynamic levels of force structure; and ensuring Air Force
            mission elements can be effectively applied at the direction of national leadership.
            4.4.4.4.12. Building Partnerships. Building partnerships is described as Airmen interacting with international
            airmen and other relevant actors to develop, guide, and sustain relationships for mutual benefit and security.
            Building partnerships is about interacting with others; therefore, it is an inherently interpersonal and cross-
            cultural undertaking. Through both words and deeds, the majority of interaction is devoted to building trust-
            based relationships for mutual benefit. It includes both foreign partners as well as domestic partners and
            emphasizes collaboration with foreign governments, militaries, and populations as well as U.S. government
            departments, agencies, industry, and NGOs. To better facilitate partnering efforts, Airmen should be competent
            in the relevant language, region, and culture. The subelements of this function are:
            4.4.4.4.12.1. Communicate. Communicate refers to developing and presenting information to domestic
            audiences to improve understanding. It is also the ability to develop and present information to foreign
            adversary audiences to affect their perceptions, will, behavior, and capabilities in order to further U.S. national
            security and/or shared global security interests.
            4.4.4.4.12.2. Shape. Shape refers to conducting activities to affect the perceptions, will, behavior, and
            capabilities of partners, military forces, and relevant populations to further U.S. national security or shared
            global security interests.

Section 4C—Air and Space Expeditionary Force
4.5. Air and Space Expeditionary Force:
      4.5.1. AEF Doctrine.
            Doctrine is those beliefs, distilled through experience and passed on from one generation of airmen to the next,
            that guide what we do; it is our codified practices on how best to employ air and space power. The Air and
            Space Expeditionary Force is the mechanism for managing and scheduling forces for expeditionary use; AEF
            doctrine is not only vital to understand how to best employ air and space power, but it is also vital to understand
            the proper way to organize, present, and deploy air and space forces. It is critical to understand that we
            organize, deploy, and employ using organizational principles based on doctrine, not ad hoc command
            arrangements.
      4.5.2. AEF Concept.
            The AEF concept is a means to provide forces and support on a rotational, and thus, a relatively more
            predictable basis. The AEF deployment construct establishes a predictable, standardized battle rhythm to ensure
            operational forces are organized, trained, equipped, and ready to respond to combatant commanders‘ requests
            for forces. Using a rotational capacity construct, deployed units undergo a period of dwell before entering
            another deployment/mobilization vulnerability period. The AEF is designed to provide forces and support on a
            rotational and more predictable basis.
      4.5.3. Expeditionary Capabilities.
            The AEF force generation construct is used to manage the battle rhythm of the force in order to meet CCDRs‘
            requirements while maintaining the highest possible level of overall readiness. There are four major elements of
82                                                                             1 OCTOBER 2013           AFPAM36-2241
     the AEF structure: readily available force, enabler force, in-place support, and institutional force. The first three
     elements are components that primarily constitute the Air Force‘s war-fighting capability and the fourth element
     provides the Air Force‘s sustainment capability to comply with federal law (10 U.S.C.).
     4.5.3.1. AEF Battle Rhythm. The Air Force relies on the AEF as a force management tool to establish a
     predictable, standardized battle rhythm ensuring rotational forces are properly organized, trained, equipped, and
     ready to sustain capabilities while rapidly responding to emerging crises. The Air Force supports global CCDR
     requirements through a combination of assigned, attached (rotational), and mobility forces that may be forward
     deployed, transient, or operating from home station. The AEF is the force generation construct used to manage
     the battle rhythm of these forces in order to meet global CCDR requirements while maintaining the highest
     possible level of overall readiness. The AEF operates on a 24-month life cycle. This cycle includes periods of
     normal training, preparation, and deployment vulnerability. However, each tempo band within the AEF
     construct operates under a different battle rhythm.
     4.5.3.2. AEF Operations. The baseline 6-month AEF vulnerability period facilitates readiness of the force to
     respond to rotational and operations plan (OPLAN) requirements. All AEF forces are vulnerable for OPLAN
     requirements—including immediately following redeployment—and are considered on call at any time during
     their postured vulnerability period. The necessary organizing, equipping, resourcing, and training processes are
     synchronized to generate ready forces.
     4.5.3.3. AEF Generation Construct. The CSAF determines the Air Force‘s operational policy for meeting and
     sustaining CCDR rotational requirements. The Air Force‘s established operational rotation policy requires
     Airmen to deploy for a baseline of 179 days. CCDR requirements may allow for shorter rotations; for example,
     to enable air reserve component (ARC) volunteerism. This rotation policy does not necessarily apply to the
     enabler forces; however the enabler lead agency must develop a plan to ensure the Air Force and SECDEF
     directed redlines are not violated. Deviations to the operational rotation policy require CSAF approval.
     Capabilities are postured in bands B through E at 1:4, 1:3, 1:2, and 1:1 deploy-to-dwell, respectively. Blocks are
     6-month vulnerability periods within the tempo bands that possess the necessary capabilities to meet CCDR
     requirements. Tempo bands and enabler forces contain both active component and ARC forces. In addition to
     the standard AEF tempo bands, the Air Force identifies the enabler and institutional forces as key components
     of the readily available force when fulfilling the SECDEF‘s requirements.
     4.5.3.3.1. Enabler Force. The enabler force includes common user assets, such as global mobility forces, SOF,
     and personnel recovery forces, space forces, and other uniquely categorized forces that provide support to
     authorized organizations within and outside the DoD. Most high demand/low supply (HD/LS) assets, National
     Air Mobility System, and Theater Air Control System (TACS) elements are postured as enabler forces and will
     rotate as operational requirements dictate. Due to their unique nature, these forces cannot be easily aligned in
     one of the tempo bands; however, every effort must be made to develop a sustainable plan.
     4.5.3.3.2. Institutional Force. The institutional force consists of those forces assigned to organizations
     responsible to carry out the SECAF 10 U.S.C. functions at the Air Force level (such as organize, train, equip,
     recruit, supply, etc.). These organizations will not posture unit type codes (UTC) in the AEF capability library,
     unless a waiver is granted by HAF. Although these organizations as a whole do not represent a war-fighting
     capability, the individuals assigned to these organizations are inherently deployable.
     4.5.3.4. Global Force Management (GFM) and AEF Tempo Band Determination:
     4.5.3.4.1. Global Force Management is a process to align force apportionment, assignment, and allocation
     methodologies in support of the National Defense Strategy (NDS), joint force availability requirements, and
     joint force assessments. GFM provides comprehensive insight into the global availability of U.S. military forces
     and capabilities. GFM also provides senior decision makers a process to quickly and accurately assess the
     impact and risk of proposed changes in force assignment, apportionment, and allocation. Within GFM, the
     Services‘ rotational forces are allocated to satisfy CCDR operational requirements for military capabilities to
     support the defense strategy and the President‘s national security strategy. The GFM allocation process has two
     specific supporting processes: rotational force allocation in support of CCDR annual force needs and emergent
     force allocation in support of CCDR emerging or crisis-based requests for capabilities and forces. The Air Force
     method to support GFM is the AEF construct.
     4.5.3.4.2. The tempo band construct synchronizes with two 12-month GFM cycles and manages forces through
     GFM assignment, allocation, and apportionment. Aligning a UTC capability into a tempo band is based on
     requirements relative to assigned rotational capability for each vulnerability period. A unit type code is a
     potential capability focused on accomplishing a specific mission that the Air Force or other military Service
     provides. HAF functional area managers (FAM) will provide validated tempo band placement to their
     applicable HAF, deputy chiefs of staff (DCS) and equivalents for approval.
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                           83

      4.5.4. Air and Space Expeditionary Task Force (AETF) Presentation.
            The U.S. Air Force supports joint force commander requirements through a combination of assigned, attached
            (rotational), and mobility forces that may be forward-deployed, transient, or operating from home station. The
            U.S. Air Force presents required capabilities to the JFC as an Air and Space Expeditionary Task Force (AETF).
            4.5.4.1. Air and Space Expeditionary Task Force (AETF). The AETF is the organizational structure for Air
            Force forces in response to operational tasking. The AETF provides a task-organized, integrated package with
            the appropriate balance of force, sustainment, control, and force protection. The AETF is a scalable, tailorable
            organization with three components: a single, clearly designated commander; appropriate command and control
            mechanisms; and tailored and fully supported forces. A numbered expeditionary air force (NEAF) is the largest
            AETF and consists of multiple air expeditionary wings (AEW) with subordinate air expeditionary groups
            (AEG) and air expeditionary squadrons (AES).
            4.5.4.2. Air Expeditionary Wing (AEW). An AEW is structured according to the Air Force combat wing
            structure and is capable of establishing and operating an expeditionary airbase as well as exercising C2 of
            subordinate units at geographically separated locations. Normally, only one AEW will be at a single location.
            Subordinate units, regardless of size, will be organized as an AEG or AES.
            4.5.4.3. Air Expeditionary Group (AEG). When an AETF is comprised of AEGs at multiple operating
            locations, each AEG will normally be attached to the nearest AEW in the same AETF. An AEG does not
            normally possess the capability to establish and operate a base; therefore, AEGs are typically tenant units at a
            deployed location. The AEG is normally the smallest independently deployable AETF. If deployed as an
            independent group as part of a larger AETF with other AEGs and/or AEWs, the AEG commander normally
            reports to the Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR).
            4.5.4.4. Air Expeditionary Squadron (AES). The AES is the basic war-fighting organization of the Air Force
            and is the building block of the AETF. However, an individual squadron is not designed to conduct independent
            operations; it normally requires support from other units to obtain the synergy needed for sustainable, effective
            operations. A single squadron or squadron element may deploy without full support elements if it is planned to
            augment a deployed AEW or AEG, and would thus obtain necessary support from the larger units.
4.6. Air and Space Expeditionary Force Schedule and Posturing:
      4.6.1. AEF Schedule.
            The AEF capability library is the basis for the AEF schedule. The AEF schedule operates on two 12-month life
            cycles that align with the GFM cycle and coincide with fiscal years. Prior to the beginning of every AEF cycle,
            functional areas will revalidate the tempo band alignment of their respective capability areas and realign forces
            if necessary. The Air Force goal is that functional areas align to the least strenuous band to minimize risk to the
            force. Every 12 months a new 24-month AEF schedule will be established.
      4.6.2. Posturing.
            All Air Force personnel contribute to the AEF and are inherently deployable or employ in-place. Designated Air
            Force war-fighting capabilities are grouped into force packages identified by UTC. AEF UTCs will be postured
            in the or UTC Availability system (UTA). Posturing UTCs is based on funded military authorizations on an
            organization‘s unit manpower document (UMD). All authorizations in war-fighting organizations must be
            accounted for when posturing UTCs in UTA. UTA and the AEF capability library are synonymous. Force
            providers should package manpower authorizations into standard deployable UTCs to the maximum extent
            possible. With unit chain-of-command involvement and MAJCOM leadership and/or AEF cell oversight,
            MAJCOM FAMs posture UTCs based on the prioritization and sequencing guidance defined by each HAF
            FAM. AEF forces can be postured as forces ready to deploy to support CCDR worldwide requirements, home
            station requirements, or reachback support to CCDRs. This provides balanced war-fighting capabilities across
            the tempo bands to support CCDR requirements. UTCs in bands B through E and enablers have different battle
            rhythms that may fall outside the base‘s two AEF vulnerability periods. Personnel not assigned to war-fighting
            organizations will have an AEF association in the Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) equivalent to the
            6-month availability window.
      4.6.3. AEF Vulnerability Period.
            At any given time, one AEF block from each tempo band is in the AEF vulnerability period. Available forces in
            their vulnerability period will be used to meet known rotational expeditionary requirements and emerging
            operational requirements.
84                                                                                       1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
              4.6.3.1. Forces aligned to the AEFs in the vulnerability period but not tasked to deploy will remain on call to
              reinforce forward-deployed forces or provide additional capability for the duration of the AEF vulnerability
              period. If tasked, their deployment commitments may extend outside their vulnerability period. In such cases,
              HQ AFPC/DPW will coordinate with supported component headquarters to synchronize deployments with AEF
              vulnerability periods.
              4.6.3.2. Regardless of AEF vulnerability period, all AEF forces are vulnerable for OPLAN tasking at all times,
              including the period immediately following redeployment, if the SECDEF determines the need to reach
              forward.
              4.6.3.3. All Airmen will be given an AEF indicator (AEFI) that corresponds to an AEF vulnerability period and
              is determined by the Airman‘s commander. Except in cases of reaching forward, individuals will deploy during
              their associated AEF vulnerability period. Changing an individual‘s AEFI will be done only under extenuating
              circumstances, along with permanent change of station (PCS) or permanent change of assignment (PCA).
         4.6.4. AEF Forced-to Source Methodology:
              4.6.4.1. The AEF is capable of supporting requirements greater than a 1:4 deploy-to-dwell (tempo band B) rate
              as required for sustaining operations.
              4.6.4.2. If requirements exceed forces available during the AEF vulnerability period, the AEF is designed to
              surge to meet increased requirements. Surge methods include reaching forward, reaching deeper, rebanding
              capability, and mobilization of ARC forces. Once a functional area realigns in a higher tempo band and is
              continuously operating in that tempo band, that functionality is not considered in surge. Table 4.1 outlines the
              various trigger points and approval levels for surge mechanics. Surging, by definition, requires forces in their
              normal training/predeployment training periods to be deployed/employed for operational requirements.

Notes:
1. Reach forward should be used for initial increase in requirements. If the increase is enduring, the capability area should
reband during the subsequent AEF schedule.
2. Reach forward, deeper, or reband requires HAF FAM coordination with applicable MAJCOMs.
3. Assumes moving to more stringent tempo band (for example, from band C to band D).
4. Consider mobilization/additional mobilization as a mitigation strategy.


              4.6.4.2.1. Through surge operations, the Air Force can make available all AEF blocks plus available enablers,
              but will require a sustained period after this level of effort to reconstitute the force, during which time Air Force
              capabilities will be severely curtailed.
              4.6.4.2.2. Surge operations will not be used to support exercises or rotational presence, unless specifically
              directed by HAF/A3/5.
              4.6.4.2.3. An active component employment ratio of one deployment period followed by a dwell period of twice
              the deployment period (1:2) for all postured capabilities is considered the maximum sustainable utilization rate
              while maintaining total Air Force unit readiness category levels 1 and 2. At category level 1, a unit possesses
              the required resources and is trained to undertake the full wartime missions for which it is organized or
AFPAM36-2241      1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                         85

           designed. At category level 2, a unit possesses the required resources and is trained to undertake most of the
           wartime missions for which it is organized or designed.
           4.6.4.2.4. Functional areas aligned in band D experiencing demand that exceed postured capabilities within the
           AEF vulnerability window should consider involuntary recall of ARC forces.
     4.6.5. AEF Reconstitution.
           Functional areas that entered surge operations must be reconstituted. Reconstitution is the restoration of combat
           capability following operations. Reconstituting capability to meet future threats sets the force and presents a
           tremendous challenge; one that must be met within the constraints of budgetary realities with an eye toward our
           transformational force and the demands of ongoing deployed operations. The HAF FAM, MAJCOM, ARC, and
           AFPC/DPW will develop and execute a reconstitution plan. In cases where reconstitution is necessary for
           multiple functional areas or across the AEF construct, AF/A5XW will work with the AEFC to provide the Air
           Force Crisis Action Team (AFCAT) (or Air Force Operations Group [AFOG]) an overall assessment and course
           of action (COA) for CSAF approval. Response to crises and expeditious reconstitution (when necessary) to a
           rotational posture with the least possible impact on the AEF schedule remains critical to the AEF concept.
4.7. Force Management.
     The AEF provides Airmen a degree of predictability in each GFM cycle, but does not guarantee the Airmen the same
     predictability from one period to the next; for example, a capability may be postured at a 1:4 tempo for GFM 13 then
     shift to a 1:3 or 1:2 tempo for GFM 14 based on emerging requirements.
     4.7.1. Deployable or ―On-Call‖ Status.
           Airmen will be assigned to one—and only one—AEF vulnerability period in a tempo band. For individuals
           assigned to war-fighting organizations, the AEFI will correspond to the same AEF block as the unit‘s UTCs; for
           individuals assigned to the institutional force, the AEFI will correspond to an AEF vulnerability period
           determined by the Airman‘s commander, or equivalent. Commanders will assign individuals to positions with
           appropriate dwell between vulnerability periods. Inbound (permanent change of station or permanent change of
           assignment) Airmen will not be assigned to a position that would require them to deploy again with less than
           the dwell for their capability tempo band. If wing commanders or equivalents approve a second deployment
           with less than the dwell for their capability tempo band, they will inform their respective MAJCOM vice
           commander (CV) or, in the case of field operating agencies (FOA) or direct reporting units (DRU), first general
           officer or civilian equivalent in the organization‘s next chain of command level.
     4.7.2. Voluntary Reassociation:
           4.7.2.1. Airmen who become temporarily disqualified during their AEF vulnerability period may be utilized
           upon return to deployable status to meet unit deployment requirements. Immediately upon return to deployable
           status, the disqualified Airman may be utilized to fill out-of-cycle requirements or short-notice individual
           augmentation requests. Unit commanders, with wing commander approval, may also realign the Airman with an
           upcoming vulnerability period. Wings will report these changes according to MAJCOM direction.
           4.7.2.2. In certain cases, unit commanders may seek Airmen to voluntarily deploy outside the AEF vulnerability
           period to fill the tasking of the individual who is temporarily nondeployable. In such instances, the wing
           commander may approve a swap of Airmen‘s AEFIs. Additionally, two individuals from the same unit with the
           same qualifications may voluntarily request a swap of AEFIs as long as the needs of the unit are still met. This
           type of swap must be approved by the wing commander. (Note: Only one approved request per individual per
           AEF schedule should be allowed.) Wings will report these changes to the MAJCOM CV according to
           MAJCOM direction.
     4.7.3. Assignment Process.
           The U.S. Air Force assignment process is managed to coincide with the AEF battle rhythm to the maximum
           extent possible. Commanders will make every effort to schedule voluntary PCS/PCA departure dates, terminal
           leave dates for retirement, and separation dates to occur during the 3-month period immediately following the
           Airman‘s deployment eligibility period or return from deployment. The assignment process will formally track
           AEF deployments on individual personnel records, and will provide visibility of individuals to all commanders.
     4.7.4. Professional Military Education (PME) and Developmental Education (DE).
           When nominating Airmen for Professional Military Education and Developmental Education, commanders
           must make every reasonable effort to de-conflict both with AEF vulnerability periods. A scheduled AEF
86                                                                                     1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
            deployment is not justification for operational deferment from PME and DE. Airmen should not be relieved
            from deployed duty if alternate school start dates are available which would allow deployment.
Section 4D—The Joint Force
4.8. Introduction:
      4.8.1. This section assists Airmen to successfully operate as members of a joint team. Specifically, it discusses the
      foundations of joint doctrine, characterizes doctrine governing unified direction of armed forces, outlines the functions
      of the DoD and its major components, describes the fundamental principles for joint command and control, details
      doctrine for joint commands, describes joint planning, provides guidance for multinational operations, and addresses
      interagency, intergovernmental organization (IGO), and non-governmental operation (NGO) coordination.
      4.8.2. The Armed Forces fulfill unique and crucial roles, defending the United States against all adversaries and
      serving as a bulwark and guarantors of U.S. security and independence. When called to action, the Armed Forces
      support and defend national interests worldwide. The Armed Forces embody the highest values and standards of
      American society and the profession of arms. The Armed Forces fulfill their roles, missions, and functions within the
      American system of civil-military relations. The Armed Forces also serve under the civilian control of the President of
      the United States, the Commander in Chief.
      4.8.3. Global challenges demand that the Armed Forces operate as a fully integrated joint team across the range of
      military operations. These operations may take place in concert with the military forces of allies and coalition partners,
      U.S. and foreign government agencies, state and local government agencies, and IGOs and NGOs. The challenges are
      best met when the unified action of the Armed Forces elicits the maximum contribution from each Service and DoD
      agency and their unique, but complementary, capabilities. The resulting synergy from their synchronized and
      integrated action is a direct reflection of those capabilities.
      4.8.4. Joint warfare is team warfare. Effective integration of joint forces protects weak points or seams from exposure
      to an adversary. Joint forces are able to rapidly and efficiently find and exploit the adversary‘s critical vulnerabilities
      and other weak points as they contribute to mission accomplishment. This does not mean that all forces will be equally
      represented in each operation. JFCs may choose the capabilities they need from the forces at their disposal.
4.9. Foundations of Joint Doctrine:
      4.9.1. Joint doctrine promotes a common perspective from which to plan, train, and conduct military operations. It
      represents what is taught, believed, and advocated as what is right (that is, what works best). U.S. military service is
      based on values that U.S. military experience has proven to be vital for operational success.
      4.9.2. These values adhere to the most idealistic societal norms, are common to all the Services, and represent the
      essence of military professionalism. Competent joint war-fighters must be skilled strategic thinkers with a joint
      perspective, able to optimize joint capabilities and apply strategic and operational warfare. Five values, while not
      specific to joint operations, have special impact on the conduct of joint operations: integrity, competency, physical
      courage, moral courage, and teamwork.
4.10. Unified Action of Armed Forces:
      4.10.1. National strategic direction is governed by the Constitution, federal law, United States Government (USG)
      policy regarding internationally recognized law, and national interest. This direction leads to unified action. The result
      of effective unified action is unity of effort to achieve national goals. At the strategic level, unity of effort requires
      coordination among government departments and executive agencies, between the executive and legislative branches,
      with NGOs, IGOs, the private sector, and among nations in any alliance or coalition.
      4.10.2. The term ―unified action‖ broadly refers to the synchronization, coordination, and (or) integration of the
      activities of governmental and nongovernmental entities with military operations to achieve unity of effort. Within this
      general category of operations, subordinate commanders of assigned or attached forces conduct either single-service or
      joint operations to support the overall operation. Unified action synchronizes, coordinates, and/or integrates joint,
      single-service, and multinational operations with the operations of other USG agencies, NGOs, and IGOs.
      4.10.3. The President and SECDEF exercise authority and control of the Armed Forces through two distinct branches
      of the chain of command (Figure 4.1). One branch runs from the President, through the SECDEF, to the CCDRs for
      missions and forces assigned to their commands. The other branch, used for purposes other than operational direction
      of forces assigned to the combatant commands, runs from the President through the SECDEF to the Secretaries of the
      military departments. Each military department, organized separately, operates under the authority, direction, and
      control of the Secretary of that military department. The Secretaries of the military departments, through their
      respective service chiefs, exercise authority over service forces not assigned to the CCDRs (for example, forces in the
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                          87

      training pipeline). The service chiefs, except as otherwise prescribed by law, perform their duties under the authority,
      direction, and control of the Secretaries of the respective military departments to whom they are directly responsible.
      4.10.4. The forces, units, and systems of all Services must operate together effectively. This effectiveness is achieved
      in part through interoperability. This includes the development and use of joint doctrine, joint OPLANs, and joint
      and/or interoperable communications and information systems. It also includes conducting joint training and exercises.
 Figure 4.1. Operational and Administrative Chain of Command.




4.11. Functions of the Department of Defense and Its Major Components:
      4.11.1. The Department of Defense (DOD) is composed of the Office of the SECDEF (OSD), the military
      departments, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), the Joint Staff, the combatant commands, the Inspector General of the
      DoD, the DoD agencies, DoD field activities, and such other offices, agencies, activities, and commands established or
      designated by law, the President, or the SECDEF. As prescribed by higher authority, the DoD will maintain and
      employ armed forces to fulfill the following aims: support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all
      enemies, foreign and domestic; ensure, by timely and effective military action, the security of the United States, its
      possessions, and areas vital to its interest; and uphold and advance the national policies and interests of the United
      States.
      4.11.2. The JCS consists of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS); the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
      Staff; the Chief of Staff, U.S. Army; the Chief of Naval Operations; the Chief of Staff, U.S. Air Force; and the
      Commandant of the Marine Corps; supported by the Joint Staff. The JCS constitutes the immediate military staff of the
      SECDEF. The Commandant of the Coast Guard may be invited by the CJCS or the service chiefs to participate in
      meetings or to discuss matters of mutual interest to the Coast Guard and the other Services.
      4.11.3. The commanders of the geographic commands—U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM), U.S. European
      Command (USEUCOM), U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM), U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM), U.S.
      Northern Command (USNORTHCOM), and U.S. Africa Command (USAFRICOM)—are each assigned a geographic
      area of responsibility (AOR) within which they use assigned or attached forces to accomplish their missions. Forces
      under the direction of the President or the SECDEF may conduct operations from any geographic area as required to
      accomplish assigned tasks, if mutually agreed upon by the commanders concerned or specifically directed by the
      President or the SECDEF. Commanders of the four functional commands—U.S. Transportation Command
      (USTRANSCOM), U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), and U.S. Special Operations Command
      (USSOCOM)—support geographic combatant commanders (GCC), conduct operations in direct support of the
      President or the SECDEF, normally in coordination with the GCC in whose AOR the operation will be conducted.
      Functional command commanders may be designated by the SECDEF as the supported CCDR for an operation.
4.12. Fundamental Principles for Joint Command and Control:
      4.12.1. Unity of command means all forces operate under a single commander with the requisite authority to direct all
      forces employed in pursuit of a common purpose. Unity of effort, however, requires coordination and cooperation
88                                                                                  1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
     among all forces toward a commonly recognized objective, although they are not necessarily part of the same
     command structure.
     4.12.2. The chain of command from the President, through the SECDEF to the CCDRs, exercises the following types
     of command authorities:
           4.12.2.1. Combatant command (COCOM) authority is the authority of a CCDR to perform those functions of
           command over assigned forces involving organizing and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks,
           designating objectives, and giving authoritative direction over all aspects of military operations, joint training
           (or in the case of USSOCOM, training of assigned forces), and logistics necessary to accomplish the missions
           assigned to the command. It cannot be delegated or transferred.
           4.12.2.2. Operational control (OPCON) is the command authority that may be exercised by commanders at any
           echelon at or below the level of combatant command and may be delegated within the command. OPCON is
           inherent in COCOM and is the authority to perform those functions of command over subordinate forces
           involving organizing and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and giving
           authoritative direction necessary to accomplish the mission. OPCON includes authoritative direction over all
           aspects of military operations and joint training necessary to accomplish missions assigned to the command.
           4.12.2.3. Tactical control (TACON) is the command authority over assigned or attached forces or commands, or
           military capability or forces made available for tasking that is limited to the detailed direction and control of
           movements or maneuvers within the operational area necessary to accomplish assigned missions or tasks.
           TACON is inherent in OPCON and may be delegated to and exercised by commanders at any echelon at or
           below the level of combatant command.
           4.12.2.4. A support relationship is established by a superior commander between subordinate commanders
           when one organization should aid, protect, complement, or sustain another force. Support may be exercised by
           commanders at any echelon at or below the combatant command level. This includes the SECDEF designating
           a support relationship between CCDRs as well as within a combatant command. The designation of supporting
           relationships is important as it conveys priorities to commanders and staffs that are planning or executing joint
           operations. The support command relationship is, by design, a somewhat vague but very flexible arrangement.
           The establishing authority (the common superior commander) is responsible for ensuring that both the
           supported commander and supporting commanders understand the degree of authority that the supported
           commander is granted.
     4.12.3. The chain of command, from the President through the SECDEF to the Secretaries of the military departments
     to the service chiefs, exercises administrative control (ADCON) authority.
           4.12.3.1. ADCON is direction or exercise of authority over subordinate or other organizations in respect to
           administration and support, including organization of service forces, control of resources and equipment,
           personnel management, unit logistics, individual and unit training, readiness, mobilization, demobilization,
           discipline, and other matters not included in the operational missions of the subordinate or other organizations.
           4.12.3.2. ADCON is a service command authority, and flows through service, not joint, channels. This authority
           is not an operational command authority but provides the requisite authority for Services to execute their
           individual ―organize, train, and equip‖ functions.
     4.12.4. All National Guard and Reserve forces (except those specifically exempted) are assigned by the SECDEF to
     the combatant commands. However, those forces are available for operational missions only when mobilized for
     specific periods, by law, or when ordered to active duty after being validated for employment by their parent service.
4.13. Doctrine for Joint Commands:
     4.13.1. Joint forces are established at three levels: unified commands, subordinate unified commands, and joint task
     forces (JTF), and can be established on either a geographic area or functional basis (Figure 4.2). These organizations
     are commanded by a Joint Force Commander (JFC). A JFC is a general term applied to a CCDR, subunified
     commander, or JTF commander authorized to exercise combatant command (command authority) or OPCON over a
     joint force.
           4.13.1.1. A unified command is a command with broad continuing missions under a single commander,
           composed of forces from two or more military departments, and established by the President, through the
           SECDEF, with the advice and assistance of the CJCS.
 AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                            89

             4.13.1.2. A specified command is a command that has broad continuing missions and is established by the
             President, through the SECDEF, with the advice and assistance of the CJCS. Currently, there are no specified
             commands designated.
Figure 4.2. Types of Joint Force Organizations.




             4.13.1.3. When authorized by the SECDEF through the CJCS, commanders of unified commands may establish
             subordinate unified commands (also called subunified commands) to conduct operations on a continuing basis
             using the criteria set forth for unified commands.
             4.13.1.4. A JTF is a joint force that is constituted and so designated by the SECDEF, a CCDR, a subordinate
             unified commander, or an existing JTF commander. A JTF may be established on a geographical area or
             functional basis when the mission has a specific limited objective and does not require overall centralized
             control of logistics.
       4.13.2. A service component command, assigned to a CCDR, consists of the service component commander and the
       service forces (such as individuals, units, detachments, and organizations, including the support forces) that have been
       assigned to that CCDR (Figure 4.3).
             4.13.2.1. The commander of a U.S. Air Force service component at any joint level (unified combatant
             command, subunified combatant command, or JTF), is by joint and U.S. Air Force definition called a
             commander, Air Force forces (COMAFFOR). The COMAFFOR provides unity of command. To a JFC, a
             COMAFFOR provides a single face for all Air Force issues. The COMAFFOR is the single commander who
             conveys commander‘s intent and is responsible for operating and supporting all Air Force forces assigned or
             attached to that joint force. Thus, the COMAFFOR commands forces through two separate chains of
             responsibility—operational and administrative. On the operational side, through the JFC‘s command authority,
             the JFC normally will conduct operations through the COMAFFOR by delegating OPCON of the Air Force
             component forces to the COMAFFOR. The administrative chain runs through service channels only, from the
             unit, up through the appropriate MAJCOM, to the CSAF and SECAF; this authority is expressed as ADCON.
             The COMAFFOR will have complete ADCON of all assigned Air Force component forces and specified
             ADCON of all attached Air Force component forces.
             The COMAFFOR also has some ADCON responsibilities for Air Force elements and personnel assigned to
             other joint force components (such as liaisons). Additionally, intertheater forces, such as intertheater airlift and
             forces transiting another COMAFFOR‘s area of interest, will be subject to the ADCON authority of the

             4.13.2.2. The COMAFFOR commands an AETF. The AETF presents a JFC with a task-organized, integrated
             package with the appropriate balance of force, sustainment, control, and force protection. The AETF presents a
             scalable, tailorable organization with three elements: a single commander, embodied in the COMAFFOR;
             appropriate C2 mechanisms; and tailored and fully supported forces.
             4.13.2.2.1. The AETF will be tailored to the mission; this includes not only forces, but also the ability to
             command and control those forces for the missions assigned. The AETF should draw first from in-theater
             resources, if available. If augmentation is needed, or if in-theater forces are not available, the AETF will draw
             as needed from the AEF currently on rotation. These forces, whether in-theater or deployed from out of theater,
             should be fully supported with the requisite maintenance, logistical support, health services, and administrative
             elements. These forces will form up within the AETF as expeditionary wings, groups, squadrons, flights,
             detachments, or elements, as necessary to provide reasonable spans of control and command elements at
             appropriate levels and to provide unit identity.
             4.13.2.2.2. AETF C2 mechanisms are in place and are usually known as an Air and Space Air Operations
             Center (AOC). An AOC may be regional or functional, aligning with the purpose of the unified command they
             support. The COMAFFOR requires command activities as tools to assist in exercising OPCON, TACON, and
             ADCON. The COMAFFOR uses an AOC to exercise control of air and space operations, and a service
             component staff (commonly called the Air Force forces [AFFOR] staff) to exercise support operations and
             ADCON. The character of the operations center may vary, depending on the nature of the forces. For air
             mobility operations, the operations center may be the Tanker Airlift Control Center at Scott AFB, while space
             operations would leverage the Air Force Space AOC at Vandenberg AFB.
             4.13.2.2.3. An AETF also needs a command entity responsible for the deployment and sustainment of AFFOR.
             The AFFOR staff is the mechanism through which the COMAFFOR exercises service responsibilities. These
             sustainment activities are sometimes referred to as ―beds, beans, and bullets.‖ The AFFOR staff is also
             responsible for the long-range planning and theater engagement operations that fall outside the AOC‘s current
             operational focus.
             4.13.2.2.3.1. The core capabilities of the AOC and AFFOR staff should be well-established, but tailored in size
             and function according to the theater and the operation. Not all operations require a full-up AOC with over
AFPAM36-2241             1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                                         91

               1,000 people or a large AFFOR staff. Smaller operations, such as some humanitarian operations, can make do
               with a small control center that does little more than scheduling and reporting.
               4.13.2.2.3.2. Not all elements of the operations center or AFFOR staff need to be forward. Some may operate
               over the horizon, using reachback to reduce the forward footprint. The goal is to maximize reachback and
               minimize forward presence in harm‘s way as much as possible.
      4.13.3. CCDRs and commanders of subordinate unified commands and JFCs have the authority to establish functional
      component commands to control military operations (Figure 4.4). JFCs may decide to establish a functional
      component command to integrate planning; reduce their span of control; and/or significantly improve combat
      efficiency, information flow, unity of effort, weapon systems management, component interaction, and control over
      the scheme of maneuver. See notes on next page to identify OPCON and command relationships.

    (1) A joint force contains Services components (because of logistic and training responsibilities), even when
    operations are conducted through functional components.
    (2) All Service and functional components are depicted; any mix of the above components can constitute a joint COMMAND RELATIONSHIP(S)
    force.                                                                                                            DETERMINED BY JFC

    (3) There may also be a Coast Guard component in a joint force.


               4.13.3.1. If air and space assets from more than one service are present within a joint force, the JFC normally
               will designate a joint force air and space component commander (JFACC) to exploit the full capabilities of joint
               air and space operations. The JFACC should be the service component commander with the preponderance of
               air and space capabilities and the ability to plan, task, and control joint air and space operations. If working with
               allies in a coalition or alliance operation, the JFACC may be designated as the combined force air and space
               component commander (CFACC). Both joint and U.S. Air Force doctrine state that one individual will normally
               be dual-hatted as COMAFFOR and JFACC/CFACC. The U.S. Air Force prefers—and in fact, plans and
               trains—to employ through a COMAFFOR who is then prepared to assume responsibilities as a JFACC if so
               designated. The JFACC recommends the proper employment of air and space forces from multiple components.
               The JFACC also plans, coordinates, allocates, tasks, executes, and assesses air and space operations to
92                                                                                   1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
            accomplish assigned operational missions. Because of the wide scope of air and space operations, the JFACC
            will typically maintain the same joint operating area/theater-wide perspective as the JFC. The JFACC, as with
            any component commander, should not also be dual-hatted as the JFC.
            4.13.3.2. Functional component commanders normally exercise TACON of forces made available to them by
            the JFC. Thus, a COMAFFOR exercises OPCON of Air Force forces and, acting as a JFACC, normally
            exercises TACON of any Navy, Army, Marine, and coalition air and space assets made available for tasking
            (i.e., those forces not retained for their own service‘s organic operations).
4.14. Joint Operation Planning:
      4.14.1. General.
            Joint operation planning is conducted within the chain of command that runs from the President through the
            SECDEF to the CCDRs and their subordinate JFCs. This process guides the CCDRs in developing plans for the
            possible employment of the military instrument of national power to meet contingencies and respond to
            unforeseen crises. A continuous process, using the full range of military operations, joint operation planning
            produces operation plans in the form of OPLANs (a complete and detailed joint plan), concept plans (joint
            operation plans in an abbreviated format), or less detailed operation plans in the form of a base plan or
            commander‘s estimate. Joint operation planning includes all activities that must be accomplished to plan for an
            anticipated operation. These planning activities are:
            4.14.1.1. Mobilization Planning. This is the process by which the Armed Forces, or part of them, are brought
            to a state of readiness for war or other national emergency. Mobilization may include activating all or part of the
            Reserve component. Mobilization is primarily the responsibility of the military departments and Services in
            close cooperation with the supported commanders and their service component commanders.
            4.14.1.2. Deployment Planning. This is planning that encompasses the movement of forces and their
            sustainment resources from their original locations to a specific destination to conduct joint operations.
            Deployment planning is the responsibility of the CCDRs in close coordination with USTRANSCOM.
            4.14.1.3. Employment Planning. Employment planning prescribes how to apply military force to attain
            specified military objectives within an operational area. It provides the foundation for, determines the scope of,
            and is limited by mobilization, deployment, and sustainment planning. Employment planning is primarily the
            responsibility of the supported CCDR and his or her subordinate and supporting commanders.
            4.14.1.4. Sustainment Planning. Sustainment planning is the provision of logistics and personnel services
            required to maintain and prolong operations until mission accomplishment. Sustainment is primarily the
            responsibility of the supported CCDR and his or her service component commanders in close cooperation with
            the Services, combat support agencies, and supporting commands.
            4.14.1.5. Redeployment Planning. This concerns the movement of units, individuals, or supplies deployed in
            one area to another area, or to another location within the area for the purpose of further employment.
            Redeployment also includes the return of forces and resources to their original location and status.
            Redeployment is primarily the responsibility of supported commanders and their service component
            commanders, in close cooperation with the supporting CCDRs and USTRANSCOM.
            4.14.1.6. Demobilization Planning. Demobilization planning includes the return of Reserve component units,
            individuals, and materiel stocks to their former status. Demobilization is primarily the responsibility of the
            military departments and Services, in close cooperation with the supported commanders and their service
            component commanders.
      4.14.2. Planning Systems.
            Many joint and service planning systems prepare operation plans and associated planning documents. The
            following is a sample of the major systems:
            4.14.2.1. Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES). JOPES is a system of joint policies,
            procedures, and reporting structures supported by communications and computer systems. It is used by joint
            planners to monitor, plan, and execute planning activities during peace and crisis. JOPES is designed to
            facilitate rapid building and timely maintenance of plans and rapid development of effective options through
            adaptation of approved operation plans during crises. JOPES allows for the effective management of operations
            in execution across the spectrum of mobilization, deployment, employment, sustainment, redeployment, and
            demobilization. All joint, conventional time-phased force deployment databases are developed by and reside in
            JOPES.
AFPAM36-2241        1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                             93

             4.14.2.2. Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segment (DCAPES). DCAPES is the Air
             Force‘s war-planning system and provides an Air Force feed to JOPES. The objective of DCAPES is to enable
             Air Force-unique operation planning and execution processes which include associated joint policy and
             procedures. DCAPES provides standard data files, formats, application programs, and management procedures
             used primarily for force planning, sourcing equipment and personnel requirements, transportation feasibility
             estimation, civil engineering, and medical planning.
      4.14.3. War and Mobilization Plan (WMP) System.
             The Air Force WMP system consists of five volumes and associated databases and is the Air Force‘s supporting
             document to several joint documents. It provides the Air Staff, Air Force planners, and Air Force commanders
             with current policies, apportioned forces, and planning factors for conducting and supporting operations.
             Reflecting and supporting joint guidance, the WMP includes a consolidated reference for general policies and
             guidance for Air Force planning; a list of apportioned combat and support forces; a set of planning factors (such
             as sortie rate) by aircraft type and theater serving as a basis for establishing worldwide support for programmed
             force levels; a list of all active plans with time-phased force deployment data; and, based on the planning
             factors, the expected aircraft activity at each base in the MAJCOM‘s AOR.
4.15. Guidance for Multinational Operations:
      4.15.1. A critical element of unified action is effective integration of allied capabilities into a campaign plan. Shared
      principles, a common view of threats, and commitment to cooperation provide far greater security than the United
      States could achieve independently. These partnerships must be nurtured and developed to ensure their relevance as
      new challenges emerge. The ability of the United States and its allies to work together to influence the global
      environment is fundamental to defeating future threats. Wherever possible, the United States works with or through
      other nations, enabling allied and partner capabilities to build their capacity and develop mechanisms to share the risks
      and responsibility of today‘s complex challenges.
      4.15.2. Multinational operations are usually undertaken within the structure of a coalition or alliance. Other possible
      arrangements include supervision by an IGO such as the United Nations (UN) or the Organization for Security and
      Cooperation in Europe. Other commonly used terms for multinational operations include allied, bilateral, combined,
      coalition, or multilateral, as appropriate. An alliance is a relationship that results from a formal agreement (such as a
      treaty) between two or more nations for broad, long-term objectives that further the common interests of the members.
      Operations conducted with units from two or more allies are referred to as combined operations. A coalition is an ad
      hoc arrangement between two or more nations for common action. Coalitions are formed by different nations with
      specific objectives, usually for a single occasion or for longer cooperation in a narrow sector of common interest.
      Operations conducted with units from two or more coalition members are referred to as coalition operations.
      4.15.3. Cultural, psychological, religious, economic, technological, informational, and political factors, as well as
      transnational dangers, all impact multinational operations. Many OPLANs to deter or counter threats are prepared
      within the context of a treaty or alliance framework. Sometimes they are developed in a less structured coalition
      framework based on temporary agreements or arrangements. Much of the information and guidance provided for
      unified action and joint operations are applicable to multinational operations. However, differences in laws, doctrine,
      organization, weapons, equipment, terminology, culture, politics, religion, and language within alliances and coalitions
      must be considered. Normally, each alliance or coalition develops its own OPLANs to guide multinational action.
      4.15.4. Each coalition or alliance will create the structure that best meets the objectives, political realities, and
      constraints of the participating nations. Political considerations heavily influence the ultimate shape of the command
      structure. However, participating nations should strive to achieve unity of effort to the maximum extent possible, with
      missions, tasks, responsibilities, and authorities clearly defined and understood by all participants. While command
      relationships are well-defined in U.S. doctrine, they are not necessarily part of the doctrinal lexicon of nations with
      whom the United States may operate in an alliance or coalition.
      4.15.5. Attaining unity of effort through unity of command for a multinational operation may not be politically
      feasible, but it should be a goal. There must be a common understanding among all national forces of the overall aim
      of the multinational force (MNF) and the plan for its attainment. A coordinated policy is essential for unity of effort,
      particularly on such matters as alliance or coalition commanders‘ authority over national logistics (including
      infrastructure); rules of engagement; fratricide prevention; and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; etc.
      While the five tenets of multinational operations may not guarantee success, ignoring them may lead to mission
      failure. The tenets are respect, rapport, knowledge of partners, patience, and coordination.
      4.15.6. The basic structures for multinational operations fall into one of three types: integrated, lead nation, or parallel
      command. Integrated commands have representative members from the member nations in the command headquarters.
94                                                                                  1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
     A lead nation structure exists when all member nations place their forces under the control of one nation. Under a
     parallel command structure, no single force commander is designated.
     4.15.7. Regardless of how the MNF is organized operationally, each nation furnishing forces normally establishes a
     national component (often called a national command element) to ensure effective administration of its forces. The
     national component provides a means to administer and support the national forces, coordinate communication to the
     parent nation, tender national military views and recommendations directly to the multinational commander, facilitate
     the assignment and reassignment of national forces to subordinate operational multinational organizations, and
     maintain personnel accountability.
     4.15.8. Although nations will often participate in multinational operations, they rarely, if ever, relinquish national
     command of their forces. Thus, forces participating in a multinational operation will always have at least two distinct
     chains of command: a national chain of command and a multinational chain of command. For the United States, under
     national command, the President retains and cannot relinquish national command authority over U.S. forces. National
     command includes the authority and responsibility for organizing, directing, coordinating, controlling, and planning
     employment, and protecting military forces. The President also has the authority to terminate U.S. participation in
     multinational operations at any time. During multinational command, MNF command authority is normally negotiated
     between the participating nations and can vary from nation to nation. Command authority will be specified in the
     implementing agreements and may include aspects of OPCON and/or TACON, as well as support relationships and
     coordinating authority.
4.16. Interagency, IGO, and NGO Coordination:
     4.16.1. Along with the effective multinational integration, interagency, IGO, and NGO coordination is essential to
     proper unified action. Interagency coordination is the cooperation and communication that occurs between agencies of
     the USG, including the DoD, to accomplish an objective. Similarly, in the context of DoD involvement, IGO and NGO
     coordination refers to coordination between elements of the DoD and IGOs or NGOs to achieve an objective. CCDRs
     and other subordinate JFCs must consider the potential requirements for interagency, IGO, and NGO coordination as a
     part of their activities across the range of military operations within and outside of their operational areas. Military
     operations must be coordinated, integrated, and/or deconflicted with the activities of other agencies of the USG, IGOs,
     NGOs, regional organizations, the operations of foreign forces, and activities of various host nation agencies within
     and en route to and from the operational area.
     4.16.2. The interagency process often is described as ―more art than science,‖ while military operations tend to depend
     more on structure and doctrine. However, some of the techniques, procedures, and systems of military C2 can facilitate
     unity of effort if they are adjusted to the dynamic world of interagency coordination and different organizational
     cultures. Unity of effort can only be achieved through close, continuous interagency and interdepartmental
     coordination and cooperation, which are necessary to overcome discord, inadequate structure and procedures,
     incompatible communications, cultural differences, and bureaucratic and personnel limitations.
     4.16.3. The National Security Council (NSC) advises and assists the President in integrating all aspects of national
     security policy, including domestic, foreign, military, intelligence, and economic (in conjunction with the National
     Economic Council). Along with its subordinate committees, the NSC is the principal means for coordinating,
     developing, and implementing national security policy. The statutory members of the NSC are the President, Vice
     President, Secretary of State, and SECDEF. The CJCS is the council‘s statutory military advisor, and the Director of
     National Intelligence is the council‘s statutory intelligence advisor. Officials of the Office of the SECDEF represent
     the SECDEF in NSC interagency groups. Similarly, the CJCS, assisted by the Joint Staff, represents the CCDRs for
     interagency matters in the NSC system. Other senior officials are invited to attend NSC meetings, as appropriate.
     4.16.4. While the NSC serves as the principal forum for considering national security policy issues requiring
     Presidential determination, the Homeland Security Council (HSC) provides a parallel forum for considering unique
     homeland security (HS) matters, especially those concerning terrorism within the United States. The HSC is
     responsible for advising and assisting the President with respect to all aspects of HS, and serves as the mechanism for
     ensuring coordination of executive departments and agencies homeland security-related activities and effective
     development and implementation of HS policies.
     4.16.5. For domestic HS-related interagency coordination that may require military participation in countering
     domestic terrorism and other civil support tasks, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has the lead. For
     homeland defense interagency coordination, DoD has the lead. The DHS is the primary forum for coordinating
     Executive Branch efforts to detect, prepare for, prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from terrorist attacks
     within the United States.
AFPAM36-2241        1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                           95

      4.16.6. In domestic situations, the Constitution, law, and other governmental directives limit the scope and nature of
      military actions. The National Guard has unique roles in domestic operations. Under control of the respective states,
      National Guard units in 32 U.S.C. and state active duty status provide a wide variety of civil support. Per the Posse
      Comitatus Act and DoD policy, the United States refrains from employing 10 U.S.C. DoD forces to enforce the law
      except in cases of necessity. Unless under authorization by the President, Congress, or the Constitution, Posse
      Comitatus, together with related DoD regulations, prohibits the Army, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy from
      directly participating in civilian law enforcement activities within the United States. In its maritime law enforcement
      role under DHS, the U.S. Coast Guard as a service under DHS, has jurisdiction in both U.S. waters and on the high
      seas as prescribed in law.
      4.16.7. When formed, a joint interagency coordination group (JIACG) can increase the CCDR‘s ability to collaborate
      with other USG civilian agencies and departments. The JIACG, an element of a GCC‘s staff, is an interagency staff
      group that establishes and enhances regular, timely, and collaborative working relationships between other
      governmental agencies‘ representatives and military operational planners at the combatant commands. If augmented
      with other partners such as IGOs, NGOs, or multinational representatives, the JIACG enhances the ability to
      collaborate and coordinate with the private sector or regional organizations. JIACGs complement the interagency
      coordination that occurs at the national level through the DoD and the NSC and HSC systems. JIACG members
      participate in contingency, crisis action, and security cooperation planning. They provide a conduit back to their parent
      organizations to help synchronize joint operations with the efforts of other government agencies.
Section 4E— Joint and Coalition Capabilities
      ―…. we will lead, and we will enable others to lead. Moreover, we will do this-always-by coordinating
      military power with the diplomacy and development efforts of our government and those of our allies
      and partners.‖

                                                      Martin E. Dempsey
                                                      General U.S. Army
                                                      18th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
4.17. Joint and Coalition Capabilities.
      4.17.1. As our Nation and armed forces are confronted with a multitude of priorities, from a shrinking force and
      limited resources, to fiscal constraints, we must be mindful to advance only the necessary resources to ensure that the
      right capabilities are integrated and interoperable across all domains of air, space, and cyberspace. Competing
      priorities today must now be carefully measured against all military capabilities, ensuring that quality—not necessarily
      quantity—smartly contributes to a faster, more flexible, agile and response force. That said, we must rely on the
      strengths of others, or be interdependent, and meanwhile ensure all capabilities can effectively intertwine, or be
      interoperable with each other to achieve an overarching objective. One of the founding initiatives, which addressed
      joint interdependence and joint interoperability, was the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization
      Act of 1986.
      4.17.2. The Goldwater-Nichols DoD Reorganization Act of 1986 made a tremendous impact on how the DoD
      conducts joint and coalition operations. This act, sponsored by Senator Barry Goldwater and Representative Bill
      Nichols, provided a statutory basis for change in our military command structure and consolidated operational
      authority through the CJCS instead of the Service chiefs for review of major personnel, material, and logistics
      requirements for the Armed Forces. Ultimately, it was passed with the intent to improve the ability of the U.S. Armed
      Forces to conduct joint and coalition operations, and also improve our DoD budget process. The Goldwater-Nichols
      Act had many purposes, but some of the primary purposes were to address weaknesses noted by interservice rivalries
      that emerged during the Vietnam War. At that time, peacetime activities, such as the procurement and creation of
      doctrine, were tailored for each Service in isolation. Just as seriously, wartime activities of each Service were planned,
      executed, and evaluated independently. These practices resulted in an inability to inhibit the development of modern
      warfare doctrine and redundancy of resources and functions, in some areas. With a desire to create a more appropriate
      balance between joint and service interests as a backdrop, Congress declared eight purposes for the act, the last having
      two parts:
             4.17.2.1. To reorganize the DoD and strengthen civilian authority.
             4.17.2.2. To improve the military advice provided to the President, NSC, SECDEF, and the commanders of the
             unified and specified combatant commands for the accomplishment of missions assigned to those commands.
96                                                                                   1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
           4.17.2.3. To ensure that the authority of commanders of unified and specified combatant commands is fully
           commensurate with the responsibility of those commanders for the accomplishment of missions assigned to
           those commands.
           4.17.2.4. To increase attention to strategy formulation and contingency planning.
           4.17.2.5. To provide for more efficient use of defense resources.
           4.17.2.6. To improve joint officer management policies.
           4.17.2.7. To enhance the effectiveness of military operations and improve DoD management and
           administration.
     4.17.3. The results over time were irrefutable. Shortly after Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, an article in
     the Washington Monthly added, ―Goldwater-Nichols helped ensure that this war had less interservice infighting, less
     deadly bureaucracy, fewer needless casualties, and more military cohesion than any major operation in decades.‖ The
     smart integration of joint and coalition coordination is our future and the key to our success.
     4.17.4. One of the first successful operational actions of combining joint and coalition integration was experienced
     during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. These operations demonstrated an unmistakable fashion the value
     and effectiveness of joint and combined military operations. The unique capabilities of each of the U.S. military
     Services, and those of each of our allies, were exploited during various phases of both operations. The combined force
     provided a synergistic combat capability which brought the greatest possible military power of the coalition force to
     bear against the opponent. Likewise, our experience also reaffirmed the importance of joint and combined training, the
     value of forward presence and the validity of joint force sequencing for power-projection. A good example of this was
     through the use of the Air Force‘s domain of space. After the Gulf War there was a near unanimous agreement that
     space-based systems greatly increased the overall effectiveness of coalition forces.
     4.17.5. Clearly, history proved that collectively, the strengths, resources, and training of one Service or nation in
     today‘s increasingly complex environment, increases and/or balances the successful outcome of a military objective.
     This was seen in Iraq and Libya, and is seen today in Afghanistan…throughout all aspects of the Global War on
     Terrorism and through other worldwide security challenges.
     4.17.6. The U.S. Air Force‘s unity of effort, through the application of air, space, and cyberspace, provides unique
     capabilities that bridge a comprehensive joint and coalition approach. This unity of effort involves the coordination
     and cooperation toward common objectives, even if the participants are not necessarily part of the same command or
     organization, but the product of successful unified action (JP 1-02).
     4.17.7. Our doctrine continues to evolve; we now rarely see any one Service or any one country unilaterally plan,
     organize, or execute an operation, but we see inclusiveness with joint, coalition, and sometimes interagency partners,
     whereby we depend on each other to succeed in today‘s complex environment. It is through this interdependence that
     we select the right resources and capabilities from each other. These capabilities simply do not get used when a
     contingency arises, but are synergized and tested through such venues as exercises and operations to ensure all joint,
     and when necessary, coalition partners can meet the desired objectives at the right time and right place.
     4.17.8. In order to be successful, there must be a clear command relationship, specifically, a supported and supporting
     command relationship between joint and coalition force components.
           4.17.8.1. Supported Command. The command having primary responsibility for all aspects of a task and
           receives assistance from another command force or capabilities.
           4.17.8.2. Supporting Command. A command that provides augmentation forces or other support to a
           supported command or develops a supporting plan by aiding, protecting, complementing, or sustaining other
           forces, and is responsible for providing the assistance required by the supported command.
     4.17.9. Each Service and coalition brings a unique balance to every operation and, depending upon the circumstances,
     the balance may shift from one Service or nation due to the different operating environments and applications
     necessary to support the best options. Our Air Force tenet of centralized control, decentralized execution is a great
     example of this. When employing strategic air attack as a line of operations, which defines the interior or exterior
     orientation of the force in relation to the enemy or that connects actions on nodes and/or decisive points related in time
     and space to an objective, we will require a high degree of centralization under an air commander, known as the
     JFACC. The JFACC must have authority over all forces, foreign or domestic, to direct operations, including attack
     sequencing and make adjustments as operations unfold. On the contrary, if tactical air operations are necessary to
     support ground troops using close air support, these air resources are best when decentralized to support ground
AFPAM36-2241      1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                           97

    commanders. The tenet of Airpower is never prosecuted alone, but space and cyberspace, which belongs to no one
    state, remains a vital imperative for joint force operations.
    4.17.10. A good example of this was played out during Operation Odyssey Dawn over Libya in 2011. During this
    operation, the joint and combined operations provided one of the greatest uses of joint and coalition capabilities in our
    recent history. In an effort to support multi-national efforts necessary to protect civilians in Libya from attacks by the
    regime of Libyan leader Muammar al-Qadhafi, the United States Africa Command (USAFRICOM) task force was
    assigned to provide operational and tactical command and control of U.S. military forces supporting the international
    response to the unrest in Libya and enforcement of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973. At the start of
    operations, USAFRICOM, commanded by General Carter Ham, exercised strategic command. Tactical command in
    the theater of operations was executed from USS Mount Whitney in the Mediterranean Sea under supported command
    of Admiral Sam Locklear, Commander, United States Naval Forces Africa. U.S. SECDEF Robert Gates indicated that
    control of the operation would be transferred to French and British authorities, or North Atlantic Treaty Organization
    (NATO), within days. The JTF was called JTF ODYSSEY DAWN.
    4.17.11. As a joint team, the supporting commands (commanders) were the Joint Force Maritime Component
    Commander Vice Admiral Harry B. Harris who controls maritime assets aboard the USS Mount Whitney, and Joint
    Force Air Component Commander Major General Margaret Woodward.
    4.17.12. As the Libyans began joining other Arab populations across North Africa in conducting antigovernment
    protests and demonstrations, time passed and the Qadhafi regime increasingly began to use military force against its
    citizens in efforts to repress the uprising. The Arab League meeting in Cairo asked the U.N. Security Council to
    impose a no-fly zone (NFZ) over Libya to protect civilians from air attack and declaring that the Qadhafi government
    had lost its sovereignty. The U.N. Security Council passed Resolution 1973 authorizing all necessary measures to
    protect civilians in Libya. The resolution authorized the use of force and the enforcement of a NFZ over Libya. The
    U.S. SECDEF approved and ordered the use of U.S. military forces in strikes against the government of Libya. The
    International Coalition took measures to begin enforcement of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, to
    include the imposition of a NFZ, launched strikes against Libyan military sites and air defense systems.
    4.17.13. To illustrate effective interdependence and interoperability, the following joint and coalition capabilities over
    Libya was a good example. The following representation was captured within the first few days of Operation Odyssey
    Dawn:
          4.17.13.1. As Maj Gen Woodward commanded the air campaign, French aircraft destroyed four Libyan tanks in
          air strikes to the southwest of the city of Benghazi. The French military claimed that its aircraft had also flown
          reconnaissance missions over all Libyan territory. On the same day, British Prime Minister David Cameron
          confirmed that Royal Air Force jets were also in action and reports suggested that the U.S. Navy had fired the
          first cruise missile. CBS News correspondent David Martin reported that three B-2 stealth bombers from
          Whiteman AFB MO flew nonstop from the United States to drop 40 bombs on a major Libyan airfield. Martin
          further reported that U.S. fighter jets were searching for Libyan ground forces to attack. The Pentagon and the
          British Ministry of Defense confirmed that, jointly, British ship HMS Triumph and U.S. Navy ships (including
          USS Barry) and submarines fired more than 110 Tomahawk cruise missiles, supported with air attacks on
          military installations, both inland and on the coast. Days later, several Storm Shadow missiles were launched by
          British jets. Nineteen U.S. planes conducted strike operations in Libya. The planes included Marine Corps AV-
          8B Harriers, U.S. Navy EA-18G Growlers, which were diverted from operations over Iraq and jammed Libyan
          radar and communications, and Air Force F-15 and F-16 fighter jets. A military convoy was destroyed south of
          Benghazi by air strikes. Seventy military vehicles were destroyed and multiple loyalist ground troop casualties
          were also reported. Four Danish F-16 fighters left Italy‘s Sigonella Air Base for a successful 5-hour long high-
          risk mission, and four Italian Tornados ECR, accompanied by four Italian aircraft. Operations continued and on
          31 March 2011 at 0600 Greenwich Mean Time, NATO took command of all operations in Libya with
          subsequent operations being conducted as part of NATO-driven Operation Unified Protector.
          4.17.13.2. Operation Odyssey Dawn was a complete success and supported the necessity of, not only joint and
          coalition capabilities, but how air, space, and cyberspace domains intertwined all facets of the operation to
          guarantee success. General Dempsey said it best when he stated [Joint and Coalition] “means building and
          presenting forces that can be molded to context—not just by adding and subtracting, but by leaders
          combining capabilities in innovative ways. It means interdependence services that rely on each other to
          achieve objectives and create capabilities that do not exist except when combined. It means a regionally
          postured, but globally networked and flexible force that can be scaled and scoped to demand.”
98                                                                                 1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
     4.17.14. Today, not one military contingency or operation, whether in peacetime or wartime, can optimize its objective
     without space or cyberspace. Airpower offers speed, agility, flexibility, range, and responsiveness to virtually every
     need, and airpower has demonstrated its success to meet our homeland and international security challenges by
     leveraging our respective capabilities and maximizing resulting synergy. Cyber operations guarantee our capability to
     operate in any contested cyber domain to support vital land, sea, air, and space missions by developing capabilities to
     protect essential military cyber systems and to speed their recovery if an attack does occur. In these interdependent
     domains the Air Force possesses unique capabilities for ensuring global mobility, long-range strike, and ISR. The
     benefits of airpower extend beyond the air domain, and operations among the air, land, maritime, space, and cyber
     domains are increasingly interdependent upon each other for the success of any and all national military objectives.
     Together, the domains of air, space, and cyberspace, effectively combined with joint and coalition capabilities, has
     proven to be the most valuable means of supporting the National Security Strategy of the United States and our allies.

Section 4F—Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES)
4.18. Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES):
      4.18.1. JOPES is the DoD-directed, single, integrated, joint command and control system for conventional operation
      planning and execution (to include theater-level nuclear and chemical plans). It includes policies, procedures,
      reporting structures, and personnel, supported by the command, control, communications, computers and intelligence
      systems and is used by the joint community to conduct joint planning during peace and crisis. Joint operation planning
      is a process coordinated through all levels of the national structure for joint planning and execution.
      4.18.2. The focus of the joint operation planning process is at the CCDRs, who use it to determine the best method of
      accomplishing assigned tasks and direct the actions necessary to accomplish the mission. JOPES is designed to
      facilitate rapid building and timely maintenance of plans and rapid development of effective options through
      adaptation of approved operation plans during crisis. JOPES allows for the effective management of operations in
      execution across the spectrum of mobilization, deployment, employment, sustainment, redeployment and
      demobilization. JOPES is supported by a networked suite of automated data processing (ADP) applications, tools, and
      databases, which reside on the Global Command and Control System. JOPES ADP systems include the mechanisms to
      create and maintain time-phased force deployment data (TPFDD) and to submit CCDR movement requirements to
      USTRANSCOM. JOPES ADP is commonly referred to as JOPES. All joint, conventional TPFDD are developed by
      and reside in JOPES ADP.
      4.18.3. JOPES also assists in identifying shortfalls, which are converted to joint operation requirements to the
      Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) system. JOPES ADP is detailed in AFI 10-401, Air Force
      Operations Planning and Execution. The directive phrase "the use of JOPES is directed" in JOPES orders directs all
      tasked organizations to use JOPES to develop plans and orders to accomplish the tasked missions. This means
      organizations must follow the guidance in JP 5-0, Joint Operation Planning, as well as all CJCS publications
      governing JOPES. Various CJCS manuals (CJCSM) govern JOPES:
             4.18.3.1. CJCSM 3122.01A, Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES) Volume I (Planning
             Policies and Procedures). This publication sets forth planning policies, processes, and procedure to govern the
             joint operation planning and execution activities and performance of the Armed Forces of the United States.
             4.18.3.2. CJCSM 3122.03C, Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES) Volume II--Planning
             Formats. This publication prescribes standard formats and minimum content requirements for OPLANs and
             CONPLANs.
             4.18.3.3. CJCSM 3122.02D, Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES) Volume III (Time-
             Phased Force Deployment Data [TPFDD] Development and Deployment Execution). This publication
             establishes procedures for the development of TPFDDs and establishes policy, processes, and procedures to
             plan and execute joint deployment and redeployment operations.
             4.18.3.4. CJCSM 3150.16D, Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES) Reporting Structure
             (JOPESREP), sets forth guidelines and standards to be used in the organization and development of information
             reporting to the JOPES database. This publication encompasses only JOPES-related joint planning and
             execution community data.
      Note: CJCSM 3122.01A and CJCSM 3122.02D are reviewed periodically by the Joint Staff and service headquarters.
      Recommended changes may be submitted at any time to the war and mobilization plans division (AF/A5XW). Air
      Force component headquarters are required to send an information copy of these recommendations to their parent
      unified command.
4.19. Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES). DCAPES is the Air Force‘s war
planning system and provides an Air Force feed to JOPES ADP. The objective of DCAPES is to enable improved and
streamlined operations planning and execution processes which include associated policy and procedures, along with
organizational and technology improvements. DCAPES provides standard data files, formats, application programs, and
management procedures that are Air Force unique, joint guidance compliant, and used primarily for force planning, sourcing
equipment, personnel requirements, transportation feasibility estimation, civil engineering support, and medical planning.
DCAPES is detailed in AFI 10-401. DCAPES supports all phases of operations planning and execution at the HAF,
MAJCOM, component, and wing/squadron level. It provides data manipulation capability to Air Force planners to perform
rapid OPLAN development, conduct feasibility capability analyses, support mobilization, deployment, sustainment,
redeployment, demobilization, reconstitution, and personnel accounting of forces.
AFPAM36-2241        1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                     101

4.20. Conclusion.
      The nature of the challenges to the United States and its interests demand that the Armed Forces operate as a fully
      integrated joint team across the range of military operations. This chapter provided essential information that all
      members of the joint force should understand. It covered levels of air and space doctrine, key doctrine concepts, AEF
      concepts, AEF force management, and joint force components and planning operations. Finally, it provided the JOPES
      used within the joint community for interagency coordination and for U.S. military involvement in multiagency and
      multinational operations.

Section 5A—Overview
5.1. Introduction.
      The Air Force faces many challenges; members may be called upon to serve in a variety of ways. Members may be
      required to protect other Air Force members and resources during major accidents; natural disasters; chemical,
      biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives (CBRNE) enemy attacks; or terrorist use of CBRNE
      material. Air Force members must understand how the Air Force Emergency Management (AFEM) Program prevents,
      prepares, responds, and recovers from such incidents. This chapter provides the framework to accomplish the AFEM
      Program mission.
Section 5B—Emergency Management Program Operation
5.2. AFEM Program.
      Protection of Air Force personnel and operational resources is essential to successful Air Force operations. The AFEM
      Program is integral to this success and describes the Air Force‘s approach to planning, organizing, training, and
      equipping personnel, and protecting mission critical infrastructures from possible major accidents, natural disasters,
      CBRNE enemy attacks, or terrorist use of CBRNE material. The AFEM Program provides guidance to aid
      commanders in developing an all-hazards approach to physical threats and captures the complete incident response
      cycle, from planning to response and recovery. This approach is known as the Air Force Incident Management System
      (AFIMS) which uses the installation disaster response force (DRF) as the structure for all responses. The DRF
      includes the crisis action team, command post (CP), emergency communications center (ECC), emergency operations
      center (EOC), incident commander (IC), first responders and emergency responders, unit control centers (UCC), and
      specialized teams. See AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations,
      Attachment 1, for definitions of these terms.
Section 5C—Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS)
5.3. General Information.
      AFIMS aligns EM planning and response with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 5 (HSPD-5), Management of
      Domestic Incidents; the National Incident Management System (NIMS); and the national response framework (NRF).
      AFIMS provides scalable and flexible response options to organize field-level operations for a broad spectrum of
      emergencies. AFIMS addresses the impacts of major accidents, natural disasters, CBRNE enemy attacks, and terrorist
      attacks. Commanders can achieve unity of effort, use resources effectively, and identify shortfalls using the AFIMS
      planning process.
5.4. AFIMS Defined.
      AFIMS is a methodology designed to incorporate the requirements of national level and Office of the Secretary of
      Defense guidance while preserving the unique military requirements of the expeditionary Air Force. This incident
      management system is consistent with the single, comprehensive approach to domestic incident management. AFIMS
      includes a set of concepts and principles covering the Incident Command System, DRF, common terminology and
      technologies, training, and resources management.
Section 5D—Incident Management
5.5. Standard Phases of Incident Management.
      AFIMS includes phases of incident management as prevention, preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation.
      These phases of incident management provide the framework with which the installation DRF responds to all EM
      incidents and events (Figure 5.1).

                                                                  For AFIMS, prevention includes broad categories of activities
                                                                  such as intelligence collection and analysis, active defense,
                                                                  proliferation prevention, fire prevention, disease prevention,
                                                                  and contamination prevention. Prevention also includes more
                                                                  specific tasks such as safety mishap investigations that
                                                                  contribute information to prevent future mishaps.
                                                                  5.5.2. Preparedness.
                                                                  Preparedness includes planning, training, exercises, and
                                                                  evaluations, as well as specific tasks such as identifying
                                                                  augmentation manpower needs or reviewing expeditionary
                                                                  support plans.
                                                                  5.5.3. Response.
                                                              Response includes deploying the DRF, executing the
                                                              Installation Emergency Management Plan (IEMP) 10-2, and
                                                              activating the installation notification and warning system.
            Imminently serious conditions resulting from any disaster or attack may require immediate action to save lives,
            prevent human suffering, or mitigate great property damage.
      5.5.4. Recovery.
            Recovery includes as a minimum, casualty treatment, unexploded ordnance (UXO) safing, personnel
            decontamination, airfield damage repair, and facility restoration. Recovery planning and actions begin as soon
            as possible to restore normal operations and ensure crucial mission sustainment.
      5.5.5. Mitigation.
            Mitigation is an ongoing process and is considered, to some degree, part of every phase. In a global sense,
            mitigation includes all activities designed to reduce or eliminate risks to persons or property, or to lessen the
            actual or potential effects or consequences of an incident.
Section 5E—Major Accident and Natural Disaster Threats
5.6. Major Accidents.
      Installations are threatened with the possibility of catastrophic major accidents that include hazardous material,
      aircraft, ammunition, explosives, transportation, facility emergencies, and industrial accidents. The installation must
      prepare for and quickly respond to major accidents to prevent the loss of life, preserve valuable resources, and protect
      the environment.
      5.6.1. AFI 10-2501 defines a major accident as an accident involving DoD materiel or DoD activities that is serious
      enough to warrant response by the installation DRF. Major accidents may occur at home station, in transit, at
      deployment locations, or during any phase of training, civil support, humanitarian support, or wartime operations.
      5.6.2. A major accident may involve one or more of the following: hazardous substances (such as radioactive
      materials, toxic industrial chemicals [TIC], toxic industrial materials [TIM], CBRNE weapons), explosives, Class A
      mishaps, extensive property damage, grave risk of injury or death to installation personnel or the public, and adverse
      public reaction. The DoD is responsible for responding to a major accident involving DoD resources or resulting from
      DoD activities. The military installation (regardless of size) nearest the scene of a major accident will respond to the
      accident unless otherwise directed by the major command (MAJCOM) or the Air Force Operations Center. This
      installation is known as the initial response base. Upon witnessing a major accident, personnel should alert others in
      the immediate area and report the accident to the security forces, fire department, or installation command and control
      (C2). After reporting the accident, personnel should:
            5.6.2.1. Stay uphill and upwind. Avoid inhaling fumes, smoke, or vapors.
            5.6.2.2. Attempt to rescue and care for casualties.
            5.6.2.3. Avoid handling any material or component involved in the accident.
            5.6.2.4. Evacuate the area if rescue or containment is impractical, or if directed to evacuate.
AFPAM36-2241          1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                               105

5.7. Natural Disasters.
       The threat of natural disasters and severe weather varies widely by geographical area. The installation must be
       prepared to adequately warn and notify personnel and to implement protective measures and recovery operations.
       5.7.1. Natural disasters and severe weather can create emergency conditions that vary widely in scope, urgency, and
       degree of damage and destruction. Specific actions taken in response, mitigation, and recovery will vary. A national-
       level response may be required to help an Air Force installation recover from large-area natural disasters.
       5.7.2. Natural disasters include severe weather events such as tornados, cyclones, floods, thunderstorms, lightning,
       extreme cold and heat, winter storms, hurricanes, typhoons, and tropical storms; tsunamis; earthquakes; fires;
       volcanoes; and any other natural weather phenomena specific to the installation. In addition to the obvious array of
       natural disasters listed, naturally occurring outbreaks of disease must not be overlooked in planning. Installations must
       develop severe weather and epidemic plans for the hazards likely to affect the location. The installation commander
       will provide emergency response and recovery operations for the dispersal, protection, or sheltering of DoD personnel
       and resources during natural disasters.
5.8. Alarm Signals.
       When a natural disaster threatens or an incident affecting the base is imminent or in progress, personnel should listen
       for a 3- to 5-minute steady or wavering siren (Figure 5.2). Additionally, they should keep the radio or television on
       and listen for instructions from local authorities and weather updates, and use the phone for emergency calls only.

5.9. Response Procedures.
      Commanders must be able to maintain the primary base mission, save lives, mitigate damage, and restore mission-
      essential resources following a natural disaster. Response levels will depend on the magnitude of the disaster and
      degree of damage. Each installation must develop natural and technological disaster response plans and policies. IEMP
      10-2 is the vehicle for installation preparation and response.
5.10. Sheltering Personnel.
      All installations should address shelter planning in the event of a natural disaster. Shelter selection is based on
      structural and personnel housing capabilities in relation to the types of disasters likely to occur in the area. Personnel
      must know where their shelter is located and understand shelter-processing procedures. Shelter–in-place procedures
      may be required to shelter personnel in the event of natural disaster or when the type or extent of the hazard is
      unknown and/or evacuation at the time would be dangerous.
5.11. Protective Measures.
      Natural disasters can be local or widespread, predictable or unpredictable. Regardless, there are ways to prepare for
      and cope with natural disasters. Take time to think; then act according to the situation. To reduce injury, loss of life,
      and property damage prepare early and develop emergency plans. For guidance on preparing, contact the installation
      readiness and emergency management flight, or visit the Air Force ―Be Ready‖ Web site
      (http://www.beready.af.mil/), as well as the Air Force Portal.
Section 5F—CBRNE Enemy Attack and Terrorist Use of CBRNE Material Threats
5.12. CBRNE Enemy Attack.
      CBRN-capable nations, including developing nations, may use these weapons to achieve political or military
      objectives. Chemical attacks achieve surprise and can cause mass casualties that hinder operational momentum;
      disrupt command, control, and communications; and degrade war-fighting potential. Biological threats can cause
      lethal, disabling, contagious, or noncontagious casualties. Nuclear threats are present within a given theater of war and
      could exist without the exchange of strategic nuclear weapons. A growing concern is that widely available TIMs and
      TICs are potential tools for asymmetric attacks against air bases. Depending on the type and quantity of TIMs and
      TICs, a deliberate release could present short- or long-term hazards.
      5.12.1. Enemy possession of CBRNE weapons, coupled with the means and will to deliver them, requires the Air
      Force to plan for, prepare, respond, and (when possible) reduce this threat. Conventional attack threats may be present
      in locations where threats of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) attack do not exist.
      5.12.2. Rockets, mortars, missiles, and bombs are all conventional weapons. Survival during a conventional attack is
      generally determined in the first few minutes. A helmet and personal body armor are the most effective individual
      protective equipment (IPE) for a conventional attack.
5.13. Passive Defense Attack Actions.
      The Air Force has universal actions and considerations for effective attack preparation, response, and recovery. In-
      place and deployed forces must be prepared to conduct combat operations as required by Air Force, MAJCOM, or
      theater directives. When a crisis or conflict arises, mobility operations and force deployment begin. The Air Force uses
      a standardized alarm system and mission-oriented protective posture (MOPP) levels to communicate the appropriate
      defense posture for in-place forces to take to transition to wartime operations. Airbase attack preparation begins before
      a potential attack. Attack response actions focus primarily on individual and weapon systems survival, and recovery
      actions focus on saving lives, detecting and mitigating hazards, mission restoration, and sustainment.
      5.13.1. Installation C2.
            Effective wartime operations require coordinated and integrated actions at all levels. Installation C2, in
            conjunction with the EOC and UCCs, implements operational plans and priorities, controls and monitors
            mission-generation capabilities, and ensures installation survivability.
      5.13.2. Phases.
             5.13.2.1. Attack Preparation. Attack preparation is the period from the present until the beginning of
             hostilities. Actions begin upon receipt of the warning order or when the in-place forces are directed to transition
             to wartime operations. Installations will refer to their vulnerability assessment and implement actions according
             to MAJCOM and theater guidance.
AFPAM36-2241        1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                         107

             5.13.2.1.1. Commanders use a recall roster (a pyramid alerting system) to recall people to their duty locations.
             Commanders initiate this system by notifying key staff members, who contact their subordinates, who notify
             others in the chain of command, until everyone is notified. Installations employ rapid and redundant installation
             warning systems that provide effective coverage for all base areas. Personnel need to know the alarm color
             codes, audible signals, or supplemental information in order to respond to the base warning signals (Figure
             5.3).
             5.13.2.1.2. Contamination avoidance measures, defined as actions to avoid or reduce the effects of a CBRN
             attack, will be used at all levels and during all attack conditions to protect critical resources.
             5.13.2.1.3. Commanders will implement MOPPs based on the threat and direct base personnel to take
             appropriate preplanned actions.
             5.13.2.1.4. Installations will establish a network of CBRN detection assets capable of rapid agent detection and
             identification, and strategically place a variety of detection equipment throughout the installation.
             5.13.2.1.5. Airbase sectors and zones will be determined for rapid reconnaissance, and displayed base grid
             maps will indicate detection device and data collection locations.

Notes:
1. Wear field gear and personal body armor (if issued) when directed.
2. Commanders may direct mission-essential tasks or functions to continue at increased risk.
3. This alarm condition may be applied to an entire installation or assigned to one or more defense sectors or CBRN zones.
4. See AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations, and AFMAN 10-2503,
Operations in a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield Explosive (CBRNE) Environment, for further
guidance on warning systems and protective actions.


             5.13.2.2. Attack Response. Attack response is when attack is imminent or in progress. Actions occur
             immediately before and during an enemy attack. Attacks can come from missiles, artillery, unmanned aircraft
             system, aircraft, and terrorist or ground forces.
             5.13.2.2.1. Alarm Conditions and MOPP Levels. Commanders declare alarm conditions to initiate passive
             defense actions in wartime. Each primary threat, such as missile, ground, aircraft, and terrorist or special
             operations forces attack, has a different characteristic and requires separate alarm warnings and MOPP levels.
108                                                                              1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
      MOPP levels are always used in conjunction with alarm conditions to quickly increase or decrease individual
      protection against CBRN threats.
      5.13.2.2.1.1. Alarm Conditions. Alarm conditions (Figure 5.3) initiate or limit individual and airbase-wide
      movement and action.
      5.13.2.2.1.2. MOPP Levels. MOPP levels (Figure 5.4) let individuals know what to wear for minimum
      protection. As MOPP levels increase, an individual‘s efficiency decreases. Work-rest cycles must be used as a
      tool to maintain consistent work levels and to prevent heat-related casualties. When CBRN threats are present,
      the commander further directs MOPP levels and variations to provide the minimum level of individual
      protection for the current mission and situation.
      5.13.2.3. Attack Recovery. Attack recovery begins after an attack when the installation assesses damage and
      repairs mission-critical facilities. It could be a period between attacks or after the final attack. A determining
      factor in quickly returning to mission-related duties is the unit‘s ability to recover after an attack. Before leaving
      cover to begin the recovery process, the environment must be determined as safe. Individuals will remain under
      cover until directed otherwise. Following any attack, every Airman must understand the importance of reporting
      contamination, UXOs, fires, casualties, and facility damage to proper authorities.
      5.13.2.3.1. Reconnaissance. In a CBRNE threat environment, rapid and accurate detection and reports of
      contaminated hazard areas, UXOs, and casualty and damage assessments are critical. Every aspect of CBRNE
      reconnaissance is virtually impossible for dedicated CBRNE specialists to accomplish alone. Active
      participation of the base populace is an absolute requirement for successful reconnaissance. Each installation
      must cultivate an ―every Airman is a detector‖ philosophy. The EOC will disseminate the information to
      installation forces and report the status of resources to higher headquarters.
      5.13.2.3.2. Contamination Avoidance:
      5.13.2.3.2.1. Measures. After an attack in a CBRNE threat environment, the base populace must accomplish
      comprehensive contamination avoidance measures. These measures equate to personal safety. Exposure to
      chemical and biological warfare agents may occur during and after an attack; therefore, everyone must use
      extreme caution to limit the spread of contamination. When movement is required, use the appropriate
      contamination control procedures as directed by the EOC. Personnel should avoid kneeling, sitting, or walking
      in contaminated areas if possible. They should not touch anything unless absolutely necessary. When the
      mission permits, teams will be sent out to detect and mark contaminated areas.
      5.13.2.3.2.2. Protect Critical Resources. Critical resources such as aircraft, vehicles, and equipment must be
      protected from contamination. These resources need to be placed under cover in hangars, sheds, or other
      structures, or covered with plastic sheets or waterproof tarpaulins before a CBRN attack occurs. Windows,
      doors, canopies, etc., must be closed when notified of a pending attack and kept closed until notified that the
      hazards no longer exist.
      5.13.2.3.3. Decontamination. Units will assess and determine what methods of decontamination, if any, can be
      reasonably put into action. If a chemical agent gets on the skin or protective equipment, it must be removed
      immediately. The reactive skin decontamination lotion (RSDL) and M295 individual decontamination kits are
      the most effective methods of removing chemical agents. In the absence of an individual decontamination kit, a
      5-percent chlorine bleach solution will remove the chemical agent from equipment and a 0.5 percent solution
      will remove agents from the skin. The eyes are very vulnerable when exposed to nerve and blister agents. If one
      of these agents gets in the eyes, the eyes should be irrigated with water.
      5.13.2.3.4. Recovery Operations. Successful base recovery efforts require a coordinated and integrated
      approach. The recovery concept involves a combined effort from personnel trained to operate as a team, using
      specialized equipment to spearhead recovery efforts. Immediate actions are necessary to treat casualties, assess
      damage, and control contamination.

      5.13.3. Protective Measures.
            To defend against CBRN attack and to survive and sustain operations in a CBRN environment requires
            knowledgeable, properly trained and equipped forces throughout the theater of operations. At the theater
            operational level, CBRN passive defense actions are used to protect U.S., allied, and coalition forces from the
            effects of attack and contamination. This includes passive defense measures to detect and identify CBRN
            agents, individual and collective protection equipment, medical response, vaccines for chemical and biological
            warfare defense, and CBRN decontamination capability. The major CBRN passive defense elements are
            contamination avoidance/control and protection.
            5.13.3.1. Contamination Avoidance. Actions to prevent contamination from getting on mission-essential
            resources and personnel, whether directly from agent deposition or by transfer from contaminated surfaces.
            Measures include actions such as covering and limiting entry to facilities, detecting, identifying, and predicting.
            5.13.3.2. Protection. When contamination cannot be avoided, protection provides forces with survival measures
            to enable them to operate in a CBRN environment. These measures include the physical measures taken to
            protect people and resources from the effects of CBRN weapons. Protection is provided through individual
            protection, collective protection, and hardening. Collective protection and hardening are threat specific. Other
            measures provide protection against multiple threats.
            5.13.3.2.1. Individual Protection:
            5.13.3.2.1.1. Individual protection is comprised of singular use or a combination of individual protective
            equipment, vaccinations and prophylaxis, protective shelters, evacuation, relocation, exposure control,
            contamination control, and warning and notification systems. Measures are taken in stages equal to the urgency
            and nature of the threat. Command and theater-specific instructions will direct the proper individual protective
            postures.
            5.13.3.2.1.2. Regardless of the type of agent, concentration, or method of attack, the best immediate protective
            equipment against chemical agents is the ground crew ensemble, a whole-body system which protects the
            wearer against chemical-biological warfare agents, toxins, and radiological particulates. It includes a protective
            mask with filters, overgarments, protective gloves, and footwear covers or overboots. It also includes M8 and
            M9 detector paper and RSDL and M295 decontamination kits.
            5.13.3.2.2. Nerve Agent Antidote. Medical representatives issue nerve agent antidotes and pretreatment during
            increased readiness. Additionally, medical representatives will issue pyridostigmine bromide tablets (P-tabs) if
            they anticipate use of a specific type of nerve agent. Members will take these tablets only if/when directed by
            the commander. The tablets, when combined with the antidote, will limit the effect of certain types of nerve
            agent poisoning.
            5.13.3.3. Sheltering Personnel. Shelters may have collective protection capabilities with an adjoining
            contamination control area.
            5.13.3.3.1. Collective protection provides personnel rest and relief (breaks and sleeping), work relief (C2,
            maintenance, supply, medical treatment), and protection of logistics storage areas (war and theater reserve
            materiel storage sites).
            5.13.3.3.2. Collective protection and conventional hardening measures further enhance survival, limit attack
            damage and contamination, and support mission sustainment. Buildings may be protected with revetments,
            earth berms, and permanent structural alterations. Sandbags, salvaged culverts, or steel drums filled with earth
            are examples of expedient methods to protect facilities.
      5.13.4. Base Populace Response.
            All personnel must know the alarm conditions and MOPP levels and what to do in response to each condition or
            level (such as where and how to take cover), understand how to report enemy sightings, provide owner-user
            security, and wear IPE. Personnel who are not affected by an attack will continue mission operations, while
            remaining vigilant within their sector.
      5.13.5. Reporting.
            Base personnel will use communication security to provide information to the UCC or the EOC. They will use
            the most expedient means possible and any means available (telephones, radios, or runners). Base personnel
            will use the S-A-L-U-T-E report as a quick and effective way to communicate enemy ground attack information
            up the chain of command (Table 5.1).

5.14. CBRNE Material.
      Air Force installations must prepare for the full range of terrorist threats, including use of CBRNE weapons.
      5.14.1. Terrorist threat or use of CBRNE material is among the emerging transnational threats. The absence of other
      dominating global powers and the existence of overwhelming capability of the U.S. Armed Forces greatly limit
      terrorist options. Increasingly, nations and terrorist groups are compelled to make use of asymmetric measures to
      accomplish their goals. According to JP 1-02, terrorism is the calculated use of unlawful violence or threat of unlawful
      violence to inculcate (instill) fear, intended to coerce or to intimidate governments or societies in the pursuit of goals
      that are generally political, religious, or ideological.
      5.14.2. Traditionally, the perceived threat of terrorism was directed toward installations in foreign countries. Today,
      the terrorist use of CBRNE material is clearly an emerging worldwide threat. Air Force personnel, equipment, and
      facilities at home and abroad are highly visible targets for terrorist attacks. Therefore, CBRNE threat planning and
      response are high-priority. The installation commander is responsible for protecting installation personnel, facilities,
      and resources.
      5.14.3. Protective measures include evacuation, relocation, exposure control, contamination control, warning and
      notification, and sheltering in place. Protective measures are taken in stages equal to the urgency and nature of the
      threat; a warning for an increased terrorist attack or threat forces will increase defense readiness, according to declared
      force protection conditions measures. Commanders at overseas locations will ensure units receive specific instruction
      and guidance on personnel and resource protection. Personnel deploying to overseas areas will ensure they are briefed,
      before and on arrival, on the enemy attack threat, protective actions, and use of protective equipment.
5.15. Conclusion.
      The U.S. Air Force is the most ready and capable air and space force in the world today. The Air Force‘s ability to
      achieve its mission hinges on readiness. Air Force people operate throughout the world, and Airmen must ensure they
      receive training in emergency management, AFIMS, incident management, major accident, natural disasters, CBRNE
      enemy attack and terrorist use of CBRNE material threats, wartime airbase threats and passive defense attack actions.
      Air Force members should use this information in concert with security and standards of conduct information to
      ensure readiness. Readiness is everyone‘s responsibility.

                                               STANDARDS OF CONDUCT
Section 6A—Overview
6.1. Introduction.
      This chapter discusses the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC), Code of Conduct, and general standards of conduct.
      Noncommissioned officers (NCO) must learn these standards well enough not only to be able to follow them, but be
      able to articulate them clearly to subordinates and enforce proper observation by other members. Used in concert with
      information presented in Chapter 5 and Chapter 19, this chapter covers issues vital to mission effectiveness, especially
      in light of the Air Force global mission.
Section 6B—Law of Armed Conflict
6.2. Law of Armed Conflict Defined.
      The Law of Armed Conflict, as defined by the DoD, is that part of international law that regulates the conduct of
      armed hostilities. The Law of Armed Conflict arises from civilized nations‘ humanitarian desire to lessen the effects of
      conflicts. LOAC protects combatants and noncombatants from unnecessary suffering, and safeguards the basic rights
      of all civilians, any prisoners of war (POW), the wounded, and the sick. The law also tries to keep conflicts from
      degenerating into savagery and brutality, thereby helping to restore peace.
6.3. Law of Armed Conflict Policy.
      DoDD 2311.01E, DoD Law of War Program, requires each military department to design a program that ensures
      LOAC observance, prevents violations, ensures prompt reporting of alleged violations, appropriately trains all forces,
      and completes a legal review of new weapons. Although other services often refer to LOAC as the law of war, within
      this chapter Law of Armed Conflict and law of war are the same. LOAC training is a treaty obligation of the United
      States under provisions of the 1949 Geneva Conventions. AFI 51-401, Training and Reporting to Ensure Compliance
      with the Law of Armed Conflict, requires that all Air Force personnel receive instruction on the principles and rules of
      the LOAC commensurate with each member‘s duties and responsibilities. The training is of a general nature; however,
      certain groups such as aircrews, medical personnel, and security forces receive additional, specialized training to
      address the unique situations they may encounter.
6.4. International and Domestic Law.
      The Law of Armed Conflict is embodied in both customary international law and treaties. Customary international
      law, reflected in practices nations have come to accept as legally binding, establishes many of the oldest rules that
      govern the conduct of military operations in armed conflict. Article VI of the U.S. Constitution states that treaty
      obligations of the United States are the ―supreme law of the land,‖ and the U.S. Supreme Court has held that U.S.
      international legal obligations, to include custom, is part of U.S. law. This means that treaties and international
      agreements with the United States enjoy equal status to laws passed by Congress and signed by the President.
      Therefore, all persons subject to U.S. law must observe the United States‘ LOAC obligations. Military personnel,
      civilians, and contractors authorized to accompany the armed forces in combat must consider the Law of Armed
      Conflict to plan and execute operations and must obey LOAC in combat. Those who commit violations are sometimes
      held criminally liable for war crimes and court-martialed under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).
6.5. Principles.
      Five important LOAC principles govern armed conflict: military necessity, distinction, proportionality, humanity, and
      chivalry.
      6.5.1. Military Necessity:
             6.5.1.1. Military necessity permits the application of only that degree of regulated force, not otherwise
             prohibited by the laws of war, required for the partial or complete submission of the enemy with the least
             expenditure of life, time, and physical resources.
             6.5.1.2. Attacks are always limited to military objectives; for example, any objects that by their nature, location,
             purpose, or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture,
             or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offer a definite military advantage. Examples include
             enemy troops, bases, supplies, lines of communications, and headquarters.
114                                                                                  1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
            6.5.1.3. Military necessity does not authorize all military action and destruction. Under no circumstances may
            military necessity authorize actions specifically prohibited by the law of war, such as the murder of prisoners of
            war, ill treatment of prisoners of war or internees, the taking of hostages, or execution or reprisal against a
            person or object specifically protected from reprisal.
      6.5.2. Distinction:
            6.5.2.1. This principle imposes a requirement to distinguish (also termed "discriminate") between military
            objectives and civilian objects.
            6.5.2.1.1. Civilian objects are protected from attack and include such objects as places of worship, schools,
            hospitals, and dwellings.
            6.5.2.1.2. Civilian objects can lose their protected status if they are used to make an effective contribution to
            military action.
            6.5.2.2. An attacker must not intentionally attack civilians or employ methods or means (weapons or tactics)
            that would cause excessive collateral civilian casualties.
            6.5.2.3. A defender has an obligation to separate civilians and civilian objects (either in the defender‘s country
            or in an occupied area) from military targets. Employment of voluntary or involuntary human shields to protect
            military objectives or individual military units or personnel is a fundamental violation of the law of war
            principle of distinction.
      6.5.3. Proportionality:
            6.5.3.1. Those who plan military operations must take into consideration the extent of civilian destruction and
            probable casualties that will result and seek to avoid or minimize such casualties and destruction to the extent
            consistent with the necessities of the military situation. Ensure civilian losses are proportionate to the military
            advantages sought.
            6.5.3.2. The concept does not apply to military facilities and forces, which are legitimate targets anywhere and
            anytime.
            6.5.3.3. Ensure damages and casualties are consistent with mission accomplishment and allowable risk to the
            attacking force (for example, the attacker need not expose its forces to extraordinary risks simply to avoid or
            minimize civilian losses).
      6.5.4. Humanity:
            Also referred to as the principle of unnecessary suffering, it prohibits the employment of any kind or degree of
            force not necessary for the purposes of war (such as for the partial or complete submission of the enemy with
            the least possible expenditure of life, time, and physical resources). For example, the 1907 Hague Convention
            prohibits the use of poison or poisoned weapons in combat. Expanding hollow-point bullets, generally known as
            "dum-dum" bullets, and indiscriminate chemical, biological, and bacterial weapons are banned by treaties
            because they cause unnecessary suffering.
      6.5.5. Chivalry.
            Chivalry demands a certain amount of fairness in offense and defense and a certain mutual respect and trust
            between opposing forces.
            6.5.5.1. The common law of war forbids treacherous attempts to injure the enemy. An example of this form of
            chivalry is the use of a white flag (or flag of truce). Its display is predicated upon good faith. Its misuse is
            prohibited and constitutes a war crime.
            6.5.5.2. Another example of how chivalry applies is the law of war requirements for treatment of persons hors
            de combat (outside the fight), or military personnel no longer able to fight due to sickness, injury, or wounds, or
            because they are shipwrecked. The principle of chivalry (and other humanitarian considerations) requires that
            an individual who is hors de combat be treated and protected as one would wish to be treated and protected by
            the enemy were the roles reversed.
6.6. The Geneva Conventions of 1949.
      Some of the most important LOAC rules come from the Geneva Conventions of 1949. The Geneva Conventions
      consist of four separate international treaties that govern the treatment of wounded and sick forces, POWs, and
AFPAM36-2241        1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                         115

      civilians during war or armed conflict. These treaties aim to protect combatants and noncombatants from unnecessary
      suffering, including the wounded, sick, shipwrecked, and POWs during hostilities. They also seek to protect civilians
      and private property.
      6.6.1. Categories of Personnel:
             6.6.1.1. Geneva Convention Distinctions. The Geneva Conventions distinguish between combatants,
             noncombatants, and civilians.
             6.6.1.1.1. Combatants. In general, any person who engages in violent acts on behalf of a state party to an
             armed conflict is a combatant. Assuming combatants act with the authority of a sovereign state, they are
             immune from prosecution for their belligerent acts as long as they have acted in accordance with the laws of
             war. A combatant is sometimes a member of a regular armed force or militia. In either case, the lawful
             combatant is commanded by a person responsible for subordinates; wears fixed distinctive emblems
             recognizable at a distance, such as uniforms; carries arms openly; and conducts his or her combat operations
             according to LOAC.
             6.6.1.1.2. Noncombatants. Noncombatants are protected persons and include certain military personnel who
             are members of the Armed Forces not authorized to engage in combatant activities, such as permanent medical
             personnel and chaplains. Noncombatants may not be made the object of attack.
             6.6.1.1.3. Civilians. Civilians are also protected persons and may not be made the object of direct attack. They
             may, however, suffer injury or death incident to a direct attack on a military objective without such an attack
             violating LOAC, if such attack is on a lawful target by lawful means. With limited exceptions, the Law of
             Armed Conflict does not authorize civilians to take an active or direct part in hostilities. Civilians who take a
             direct part in hostilities without authority to do so are unlawful combatants, also known as unprivileged
             combatants.
             6.6.1.2. Unlawful Combatants: A Distinction Not Made by the Geneva Conventions. The term unlawful
             combatant is not used in the Geneva Conventions. The term ―unlawful enemy combatant‖ is defined in DoDD
             2310.01E, The Department of Defense Detainee Program, as ―persons not entitled to combatant immunity, who
             engage in acts against the United States or its coalition partners in violation of the laws and customs of war
             during an armed conflict.‖ An unlawful combatant is an individual who is not authorized by a state that is party
             to a conflict to take part in hostilities but does so anyway. For example, civilians who plant improvised
             explosive devices are unlawful combatants. Unlawful combatants become lawful targets and, if captured, may
             be tried as criminals for their unlawful actions.
      6.6.2. Undetermined Status.
             Should doubt exist as to whether a captured individual is a lawful combatant, noncombatant, or an unlawful
             combatant, the individual will receive the protections of the Geneva Prisoner of War Convention until status is
             determined.
6.7. Military Objectives.
      The Law of Armed Conflict governs the conduct of aerial warfare. The principle of military necessity authorizes aerial
      attacks on combatants and other lawful military objectives. Military objectives are limited to those objects or
      installations that by their own nature, location, purpose, or use make an effective contribution to military action and
      whose total or partial destruction, capture, or neutralization in the circumstances existing at the time offer a definite
      military advantage.
      6.7.1. Protection of Civilians and Civilian Objects.
             LOAC protects civilian populations. Military attacks against cities, towns, or villages not justified by military
             necessity are forbidden. Attacking civilians for the sole purpose of terrorizing them is also prohibited. Although
             civilians may not be made the object of a direct attack, LOAC recognizes that a military objective need not be
             spared because its destruction may cause collateral damage that results in the unintended death or injury to
             civilians or damage to their property. Commanders and their planners must take into consideration the extent of
             damage to civilian objects and casualties anticipated as a result of an attack on a military objective and seek to
             avoid or minimize civilian casualties and destruction. Anticipated damage to civilian objects and civilian
             casualties must not be disproportionate to the military advantage sought. Judge advocate, intelligence, and
             operations personnel play a critical role in determining the propriety of a target and the choice of weapon to be
             used under the particular circumstances known to the commander when planning an attack.
116                                                                                    1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
      6.7.2. Specifically Protected Objects.
            The Law of Armed Conflict provides specific protection to certain objects, including medical units or
            establishments; transports of wounded and sick personnel; military and civilian hospital ships; safety zones
            established under the Geneva Conventions; and religious, cultural, and charitable buildings, monuments, and
            POW camps. However, if these protected objects are used for military purposes, they lose their protected status.
            Protected objects near lawful military objectives that suffer collateral damage when the nearby military
            objectives are lawfully engaged does not violate LOAC.
6.8. Aircraft and Combat:
      6.8.1. Enemy Military Aircraft and Aircrew.
            Enemy military aircraft may be attacked and destroyed wherever found, unless in neutral airspace or territory.
            Discontinue an attack on enemy military aircraft if the aircraft is clearly disabled and has lost its means of
            combat. Airmen who parachute from a disabled aircraft and offer no resistance may not be attacked. Airmen
            who resist in descent or are downed behind their own lines and who continue to fight may be subject to attack.
            The rules of engagement (ROE) for a particular operation often include additional guidance for attacking enemy
            aircraft consistent with LOAC obligations.
      6.8.2. Enemy Civilian Aircraft.
            An enemy‘s public and private nonmilitary aircraft are generally not subject to attack unless used for a military
            purpose. Since World War II (WWII), nations have increasingly recognized the necessity to avoid attacking
            civil aircraft. Under exceptional conditions, however, civil aircraft in flight may be lawfully attacked. If a civil
            aircraft initiates an attack, it may be considered an immediate military threat and may be lawfully attacked. An
            immediate military threat justifying an attack may also exist when reasonable suspicion exists of a hostile
            intent, such as when a civil aircraft approaches a military base at high speed, or enters enemy territory without
            permission and disregards signals or warnings to land or proceed to a designated place.
      6.8.3. Military Medical Aircraft.
            Military medical aircraft are used exclusively for the removal of the wounded and sick and for the transport of
            medical personnel and equipment. Military medical aircraft are entitled to protection from attack by enemy
            combatants while flying at heights, times, and on routes specifically agreed upon between the parties to the
            conflict. Under LOAC, a military medical aircraft could be lawfully attacked and destroyed if it:
            6.8.3.1. Initiates an attack.
            6.8.3.2. Does not bear a clearly marked Red Cross, Red Crescent, or other recognized symbol and is not
            otherwise known to be engaged in medical operations at the time.
            6.8.3.3. Does not fly at heights, at times, and on routes specifically agreed to by the parties to the conflict and is
            not otherwise known to be engaged in medical operations at the time.
            6.8.3.4. Flies over enemy territory or enemy-occupied territory (unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties)
            and is not otherwise known to be engaged in medical operations at the time.
            6.8.3.5. Approaches its enemy‘s territory or a combat zone and disregards a summons to land and is not
            otherwise known to be engaged in medical operations at the time.
6.9. Enforcing Law of Armed Conflict Rules:
      6.9.1. Prosecution.
            Military members who violate LOAC are subject to criminal prosecution and punishment. Criminal
            prosecutions may take place in a national or international forum. U.S. Armed Forces could be prosecuted by
            courts-martial under the UCMJ or through an international military tribunal, such as those used in Nuremberg
            and Tokyo after WWII. ―I was only following orders,‖ generally is not accepted by national or international
            tribunals as a war crime defense. Individual Airmen are responsible for their actions and must comply with
            LOAC.
      6.9.2. Reprisal.
            Reprisals are the commission of otherwise illegal acts that, under the circumstances, may be justified as a last
            resort to put an end to illegal acts committed first by the adversary. For example, if any enemy employs illegal
            weapons against a state, the victim may resort to the use of weapons that would otherwise be unlawful in order
            to compel the enemy to cease its prior violation. Reprisals can be legally justified if they meet certain
AFPAM36-2241           1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                         117

                requirements. Authority to approve reprisals is held at the highest decision-making level. Only the President of
                the United States, as Commander in Chief, may authorize U.S. forces to take such an action.
6.10. Reporting Violations.
      AFI 51-401 includes guidance on handling a possible LOAC violation. An Air Force member who knows or receives a
      report of an apparent LOAC violation must inform his or her commander. This includes violations by the enemy,
      allies, U.S. Armed Forces, or others. If the allegation involves or may involve a U.S. commander, the report should be
      made to the next higher U.S. command authority. Particular circumstances may require that the report be made to the
      nearest judge advocate, a special agent in the Office of Special Investigations, a chaplain, or a security forces member.
6.11. Rules of Engagement.
      ROEs exist to ensure use of force in an operation occurs according to national policy goals, mission requirements, and
      the rule of law. In general, ROEs set parameters for when, where, how, why, and against whom commanders and their
      Airmen may use force. Mission-specific ROEs present a more detailed application of LOAC principles tailored to the
      political and military nature of a mission which are contained in execution orders, operations plans, and operations
      orders. All Airmen have a duty and a legal obligation to understand, remember, and apply mission ROEs. Failure to
      comply with ROEs may be punishable under the UCMJ. The U.S. standing rules of engagement (SROE), approved by
      the President and Secretary of Defense and issued by the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, provide implementation
      guidance on the inherent right of self-defense and the application of force for mission accomplishment. Commanders
      at every echelon have an obligation to ensure that mission ROEs comply with the SROEs. The fundamental U.S.
      policy on self-defense is repeatedly stated throughout the SROEs: ―These rules do not limit a commander‘s inherent
      authority and obligation to use all necessary means available to take all appropriate actions in self-defense of the
      commander‘s unit and other U.S. forces in the vicinity.‖ Self-defense methods include national, collective, unit, and
      individual. Several elements must be considered before undertaking the use of force in self-defense:
      6.11.1. Necessity.
                Military necessity exists if a hostile act is committed or hostile intent is demonstrated against U.S. forces or
                other designated persons or property.
      6.11.2. Proportionality.
                In self-defense, U.S. forces may only use the amount of force necessary to decisively counter a hostile act or a
                demonstration of hostile intent and ensure the continued safety of U.S. forces or other designated persons and
                property which are ordered to be protected. Force used must be reasonable in intensity, duration, and magnitude
                compared to the threat based on facts known at the time.
      6.11.3. Hostile Act.
                A hostile act is defined as force used against the U.S., U.S. forces, designated persons and property, or intended
                to impede the mission of U.S. forces.
      6.11.4. Hostile Intent.
                Hostile intent is the threat of imminent use of force against the U.S., U.S. forces, designated persons and
                property, or intended to impede the mission of U.S. forces.
      6.11.5. Declared Hostile Force.
                A declared hostile force is any civilian, paramilitary, or military force or terrorist declared hostile by an
                appropriate U.S. authority.
Section 6C—Code of Conduct
6.12. Policy.
      The Code of Conduct outlines basic responsibilities and obligations of members of the U.S. Armed Forces. All
      members are expected to measure up to the standards described in the Code of Conduct. Although developed for
      POWs, the spirit and intent are applicable to service members subject to other hostile detention. Such service members
      should consistently conduct themselves in a manner that brings credit to them and their country. The six articles of the
      Code of Conduct address situations and decision areas that any member could encounter to some degree. The Code of
      Conduct includes basic information useful to POWs to help them survive honorably while resisting captors‘ efforts to
      exploit them. Such survival and resistance require knowledge and understanding of the articles.
118                                                                                   1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
6.13. Training.
      DoD personnel who plan, schedule, commit, or control members of the Armed Forces must fully understand the Code
      of Conduct and ensure personnel have the training and education necessary to abide by it. How much knowledge
      members need depends on how likely they are to be captured, their exposure to sensitive information, and how useful
      or valuable a captor considers them. Training is conducted at three levels:
      6.13.1. Level A—Entry Level Training.
            Level A represents the minimum level of understanding needed for all members of the Armed Forces. This level
            is imparted to all personnel during entry training.
      6.13.2. Level B—Training After Assumption of Duty Eligibility.
            Level B is the minimum level of understanding needed for service members whose military jobs, specialties, or
            assignments entail moderate risk of capture, such as members of ground combat units. Training is conducted for
            such service members as soon as their assumption of duty makes them eligible.
      6.13.3. Level C—Training Upon Assumption of Duties or Responsibilities.
            Level C is the minimum level of understanding needed for military service members whose military jobs,
            specialties, or assignments entail significant or high risk of capture and whose position, rank, or seniority makes
            them vulnerable to greater-than-average exploitation efforts by a captor. Examples include aircrews and special
            mission forces such as Air Force pararescue teams. Training for these members is conducted upon their
            assumption of the duties or responsibilities.
6.14. The Articles of the Code of Conduct.
      President Dwight D. Eisenhower first published the Code of Conduct for members of the Armed Forces of the United
      States on 17 August 1955. In March 1988, President Ronald W. Reagan amended the code with gender-neutral
      language.
      6.14.1. ARTICLE I.
            I am an American, fighting in the forces which guard my country and our way of life. I am prepared to give my
            life in their defense.
            6.14.1.1. Explanation. Article I applies to all members at all times. A member of the Armed Forces has a duty
            to support U.S. interests and oppose U.S. enemies regardless of the circumstances, whether in active combat or
            captivity.
            6.14.1.2. Training. Familiarity with the wording and basic meaning is necessary to understand that:
            6.14.1.2.1. Past experience of captured Americans reveals that honorable survival in captivity requires a high
            degree of dedication and motivation.
            6.14.1.2.2. Maintaining these qualities requires knowledge of and a strong belief in the advantages of American
            democratic institutions and concepts.
            6.14.1.2.3. Maintaining these qualities also requires a love of and faith in the United States and a conviction that
            the United States‘ cause is just.
            6.14.1.2.4. Honorable survival in captivity depends on faith in and loyalty to fellow POWs.
      Note: Possessing the dedication and motivation fostered by such beliefs and trust may help POWs survive long,
      stressful periods of captivity, and has helped many return to their country and families with their honor and self-esteem
      intact.
      6.14.2. ARTICLE II.
            I will never surrender of my own free will. If in command, I will never surrender the members of my command
            while they still have the means to resist.
            6.14.2.1. Explanation. Members of the Armed Forces may never surrender voluntarily. Even when isolated and
            no longer able to inflict casualties on the enemy or otherwise defend themselves, their duty is to evade capture
            and rejoin the nearest friendly force. Only when evasion is impossible and further fighting would lead to their
            death with no significant loss to the enemy may the means to resist or evade be considered exhausted.
            6.14.2.2. Training. Service members who are cut off, shot down, or otherwise isolated in enemy-controlled
            territory must make every effort to avoid capture. Actions available include concealment until recovered by
AFPAM36-2241    1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                           119

         friendly rescue forces, evasive travel to a friendly or neutral territory, and evasive travel to other prebriefed
         areas. Members must understand that capture is not dishonorable if all reasonable means of avoiding it have
         been exhausted, and the only alternative is death. Service members must understand and have confidence in
         search and recovery forces rescue procedures and techniques, and proper evasion destination procedures.
    6.14.3. ARTICLE III.
         If I am captured, I will continue to resist by all means available. I will make every effort to escape and aid
         others to escape. I will accept neither parole nor special favors from the enemy.
         6.14.3.1. Explanation:
         6.14.3.1.1. An Armed Forces member‘s duty to continue to resist enemy exploitation by all means available is
         not lessened by the misfortune of capture. Contrary to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, enemies U.S. forces have
         engaged since 1949 have treated the prisoner of war compound as an extension of the battlefield. The POW
         must be prepared for this.
         6.14.3.1.2. Enemies have used a variety of tactics to exploit POWs for propaganda purposes or to obtain
         military information, in spite of Geneva Conventions prohibition. Physical and mental harassment, general
         mistreatment, torture, medical neglect, and political indoctrination have all been used, and the enemy has tried
         to tempt POWs to accept special favors or privileges in return for statements or information, or for a pledge by
         the POW not to attempt escape.
         6.14.3.1.3. A prisoner of war must not seek special privileges or accept special favors at the expense of fellow
         POWs. Under the guidance and supervision of the senior military person, the prisoner of war must be prepared
         to take advantage of escape opportunities. In communal detention, the welfare of the POWs who remain behind
         must be considered. Additionally, POWs should not sign or enter into a parole agreement. Parole agreements
         are promises the POWs make to the captor to fulfill stated conditions, such as not to bear arms, in exchange for
         special privileges, such as release or lessened restraint.
         6.14.3.2. Training. Members should understand that captivity involves continuous control by a captor who may
         attempt to use the POW as a source of information for political purposes or as a potential subject for political
         indoctrination. Members must familiarize themselves with prisoner of war and captor rights and obligations
         under the Geneva Conventions, understanding that some captors have accused POWs of being war criminals
         simply because they waged war against them. Continued efforts to escape are critical because a successful
         escape causes the enemy to divert forces that may otherwise be fighting, provides the United States valuable
         information about the enemy and other POWs, and serves as a positive example to all members of the Armed
         Forces.
    6.14.4. ARTICLE IV.
         If I become a prisoner of war, I will keep faith with my fellow prisoners. I will give no information or take part
         in any action which might be harmful to my comrades. If I am senior, I will take command. If not, I will obey the
         lawful orders of those appointed over me and will back them up in every way.
         6.14.4.1. Explanation. Officers and NCOs continue to carry out their responsibilities and exercise authority in
         captivity. Informing, or any other action detrimental to a fellow prisoner of war, is despicable and expressly
         forbidden. POWs must avoid helping the enemy identify fellow POWs who may have valuable knowledge to
         the enemy. Strong leadership is essential to discipline. Without discipline, camp organization, resistance, and
         even survival may be impossible. Personal hygiene, camp sanitation, and care of the sick and wounded are
         imperative. Wherever located, POWs must organize in a military manner under the senior military prisoner of
         war, regardless of military service. If the senior prisoner of war is incapacitated or otherwise unable to act, the
         next senior POW assumes command.
         6.14.4.2. Training. Members must be trained to understand and accept leadership from those in command and
         abide by the decisions of the senior prisoner of war, regardless of military service. Failing to do so may result in
         legal proceedings under the UCMJ. Additionally, a prisoner of war who voluntarily informs or collaborates with
         the captor is a traitor to the United States and fellow POWs and, after repatriation, is subject to punishment
         under the UCMJ. Service members must be familiar with the principles of hygiene, sanitation, health
         maintenance, first aid, physical conditioning, and food utilization.
120                                                                                  1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
      6.14.5. ARTICLE V.
            When questioned, should I become a prisoner of war, I am required to give name, rank, service number, and
            date of birth. I will evade answering further questions to the utmost of my ability. I will make no oral or written
            statements disloyal to my country and its allies or harmful to their cause.
            6.14.5.1. Explanation:
            6.14.5.1.1. When questioned, a prisoner of war is required by the Geneva Conventions, and permitted by the
            UCMJ, to give name, rank, service number, and date of birth. Under the Geneva Conventions, the enemy has no
            right to try to force a POW to provide any additional information. However, it is unrealistic to expect a POW to
            remain confined for years reciting only name, rank, service number, and date of birth. Many POW camp
            situations exist in which certain types of conversation with the enemy are permitted. For example, a POW is
            allowed, but not required by the Code of Conduct, the UCMJ, or the Geneva Conventions, to fill out a Geneva
            Conventions capture card, to write letters home, and to communicate with captors on matters of health and
            welfare. The senior POW is required to represent POWs in matters of camp administration, health, welfare, and
            grievances.
             6.14.5.1.2. A prisoner of war must resist, avoid, or evade, even when physically and mentally coerced, all
             enemy efforts to secure statements or actions that may further the enemy‘s cause. Examples of statements or
             actions POWs should resist include giving oral or written confessions, answering questionnaires, providing
             personal history statements, and making propaganda recordings and broadcast appeals to other POWs to
             comply with improper captor demands. Additionally, POWs should resist appealing for U.S. surrender or
             parole, engaging in self-criticism, or providing oral or written statements or communication that are harmful to
             the United States, its allies, the Armed Forces, or other POWs. Experience has shown that, although enemy
             interrogation sessions may be harsh and cruel, a POW can usually resist if there is a will to resist. The best way
             for a POW to keep faith with the United States, fellow POWs, and him or herself is to provide the enemy with
             as little information as possible.
            6.14.5.2. Training. Service members familiarize themselves with the various aspects of interrogation, including
            phases, procedures, and methods and techniques, as well as the interrogator‘s goals, strengths, and weaknesses.
            Members should avoid disclosing information by such techniques as claiming inability to furnish information
            because of previous orders, poor memory, ignorance, or lack of comprehension. They should understand that,
            short of death, it is unlikely that a POW may prevent a skilled enemy interrogator, using all available
            psychological and physical methods of coercion, from obtaining some degree of compliance by the POW.
            However, the prisoner of war must recover as quickly as possible and resist successive efforts to the utmost.
      6.14.6. ARTICLE VI.
            I will never forget that I am an American, fighting for freedom, responsible for my actions, and dedicated to the
            principles which made my country free. I will trust in my God and in the United States of America.
            6.14.6.1. Explanation. A member of the Armed Forces remains responsible for personal actions at all times.
            When repatriated, POWs can expect their actions to be subject to review, both circumstances of capture and
            conduct during detention. The purpose of such a review is to recognize meritorious performance and, if
            necessary, investigate any allegations of misconduct. Such reviews are conducted with due regard for the rights
            of the individual and consideration for the conditions of captivity.
            6.14.6.2. Training. Members must understand the relationship between the UCMJ and the Code of Conduct and
            realize that failure to follow the guidance may result in violations punishable under the UCMJ, and they may be
            held legally accountable for their actions. They should also understand that the U.S. Government will use every
            available means to establish contact with POWs, to support them, and to obtain their release. Furthermore, U.S.
            laws provide for the support and care of dependents of the Armed Forces, including POWs‘ family members.
            Military members must ensure their personal affairs and family matters are up to date at all times.
6.15. Detention of U.S. Military Personnel in Operations Other than War:
      6.15.1. Policy.
            U.S. military personnel isolated from U.S. control are still required to do everything in their power to follow
            DoD and Air Force policy and survive with honor. DoDI 1300.21, Code of Conduct (CoC) Training and
            Education, Enclosure 3, provides guidance to military members who find themselves isolated during operations
            other than war or in a situation not addressed specifically in the Code of Conduct. All military departments
            establish procedures to ensure U.S. military personnel are familiar with the guidance in this publication.
AFPAM36-2241     1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                            121

    6.15.2. Rationale.
          Because of their wide range of activities, U.S. military personnel are subject to detention by unfriendly
          governments or captivity by terrorist groups. When a hostile government or terrorist group detains or captures
          U.S. military personnel, the captor is often attempting to exploit both the individual and the U.S. Government
          for its own purposes. As history has shown, exploitation can take many forms, such as hostage confessions to
          crimes never committed, international news media exploitation, and substantial ransom demands, all of which
          can lead to increased credibility and support for the detainer.
    6.15.3. Responsibility:
           6.15.3.1. U.S. military personnel detained by unfriendly governments or held hostage by a terrorist group must
           do everything in their power to survive with honor. Furthermore, whether U.S. military personnel are detained
           or held hostage, they can be sure the U.S. Government will make every effort to obtain their release. To best
           survive the situation, military personnel must maintain faith in their country, in fellow detainees or captives
           and, most importantly, in themselves. In any group captivity situation, military captives must organize, to the
           fullest extent possible, under the senior military member present. If civilians are part of the group, they should
           be encouraged to participate.
          6.15.3.2. U.S. military personnel must make every reasonable effort to prevent captors from exploiting them
          and the U.S. Government. If exploitation cannot be prevented, military members must attempt to limit it. If
          detainees convince their captors of their low propaganda value, the captors may seek a quick end to the
          situation. When a detention or hostage situation ends, military members who can honestly say they did their
          utmost to resist exploitation will have upheld DoD policy, the founding principles of the United States, and the
          highest traditions of military service.
    6.15.4. Military Bearing and Courtesy.
          U.S. military members held captive should always display proper military bearing and courtesy. Remaining
          calm, courteous, and respectful has advantages and will serve the detainee or hostage better than discourteous,
          unprofessional behavior. Such behavior often results in punishment that serves no useful purpose. In some
          situations, such behavior may jeopardize survival and severely complicate efforts to gain release of the detainee
          or hostage.
    6.15.5. Guidance for Detention by Governments:
          6.15.5.1. Detainees in the custody of a hostile government, regardless of the circumstances that resulted in the
          detention, are subject to the laws of that government. Detainees must maintain military bearing and avoid
          aggressive, combative, or illegal behavior that may complicate their situation, legal status, or efforts to negotiate
          a rapid release. As American citizens, detainees should ask immediately and continually to see U.S. embassy
          personnel or a representative of an allied or neutral government. U.S. military personnel who become lost or
          isolated in a hostile foreign country during operations other than war will not act as combatants during evasion
          attempts. During operations other than war, there is no protection afforded under the Geneva Convention. The
          civil laws of that country apply.
          6.15.5.2. A detainer‘s goal may be maximum political exploitation. Therefore, detained U.S. military personnel
          must be cautious in all they say and do. In addition to asking for a U.S. representative, detainees should provide
          name, rank, service number, date of birth, and the innocent circumstances leading to their detention. They
          should limit further discussions to health and welfare matters, conditions of their fellow detainees, and going
          home.
          6.15.5.3. Detainees should avoid signing any document or making any statement, oral or otherwise. If forced,
          they must provide as little information as possible and then continue to resist. Detainees are not likely to earn
          their release by cooperation. Rather, release may be gained by resisting, thereby reducing the value of the
          detainee. U.S. military detainees should not refuse release, unless doing so requires them to compromise their
          honor or cause damage to the U.S. Government or its allies. Escape attempts must be made only after carefully
          considering the risk of violence, chance of success, and detrimental effects on detainees remaining behind.
          Jailbreak in most countries is a crime. Escape attempts can provide the detainer further justification to hold the
          individual.
    6.15.6. Terrorist Hostage:
          6.15.6.1. Capture by terrorists is generally the least predictable and structured form of operations, other than
          war captivity. Capture can range from a spontaneous kidnapping to a carefully planned hijacking. In either
122                                                                                      1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
                situation, hostages play an important role in determining their own fate because terrorists rarely expect to
                receive rewards for providing good treatment or releasing victims unharmed. U.S. military members should
                assume their captors are genuine terrorists when unclear if they are surrogates of a government.
                6.15.6.2. A terrorist hostage situation is more volatile than a government detention, so members must take steps
                to lessen the chance of a terrorist indiscriminately killing hostages. In such a situation, DoD policy accepts and
                promotes efforts to establish rapport between U.S. hostages and the terrorists in order to establish themselves as
                people in the terrorist‘s mind, rather than a stereotypical symbol of a country the terrorist may hate. DoD policy
                recommends U.S. personnel talk to terrorists about nonsubstantive subjects such as family, sports, and hobbies.
                They should stay away from topics that could inflame terrorist sensibilities, such as their cause, politics, or
                religion. Listening can be vitally important when survival is at stake. Members should take an active role in the
                conversation, but should not argue, patronize, or debate issues with the captors. They should try to reduce
                tension and make it as hard as possible for terrorists to identify U.S. personnel as troublemakers, which may
                mark them for murder.
Section 6D—Everyday Conduct
6.16. Overview.
      The importance of the Air Force mission and responsibility to the nation requires members adhere to higher standards
      than nonmilitary members. Every person is accountable for his or her own actions on duty and off. Supervisors must
      hold subordinates accountable and take corrective action if they do not fulfill their responsibilities. Members must
      remember and reflect the Air Force Core Values—Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence in All We Do—
      in everything they do.
6.17. Policy.
       DoDD 5500.07, Standards of Conduct, DoD 5500.07-R, The Joint Ethics Regulation (JER), and AFI 1-1, Air Force
       Standards provide guidance to Air Force personnel on standards of conduct. Military members who violate the
       punitive provisions may be prosecuted under the UCMJ. Civilian violations may result in disciplinary action without
       regard to the issue of criminal liability. Military members and civilian employees who violate these standards, even if
       such violations do not constitute criminal misconduct, are subject to administrative actions, such as reprimands.
       Contact the base legal office for assistance.
6.18. Ethical Values.
      Ethics are standards of conduct based on values. Values are core beliefs, such as duty, honor, and integrity, that
      motivate attitudes and actions. Not all values are ethical values (integrity is; happiness is not). Ethical values relate to
      what is right and wrong and thus take precedence over nonethical values when making ethical decisions. DoD
      employees who make decisions as part of their official duties should carefully consider ethical values. Primary ethical
      values include:
      6.18.1. Honesty.
                Being truthful, straightforward, and candid are aspects of honesty.
                6.18.1.1. Truthfulness is required. Deceptions are usually easily uncovered. Lies erode credibility and
                undermine public confidence. Untruths told for seemingly altruistic reasons (to prevent hurt feelings, to promote
                good will, etc.) are nonetheless resented by the recipients.
                6.18.1.2. Straightforwardness adds frankness to truthfulness and is usually necessary to promote public
                confidence and to ensure effective, efficient conduct of operations. Truths presented in such a way as to lead
                recipients to confusion, misinterpretation, or inaccurate conclusions are not productive. Such indirect deceptions
                can promote ill will and erode openness, especially when there is an expectation of frankness.
                6.18.1.3. Candor is the forthright offering of unrequested information. This ethical value is necessary according
                to the gravity of the situation and the nature of the relationships. Candor is required when a reasonable person
                would feel betrayed if the information was withheld. In some circumstances, silence is dishonest; yet in other
                circumstances, disclosing information would be wrong and perhaps unlawful.
      6.18.2. Integrity.
                Being faithful to one‘s convictions is part of integrity. Following principles, acting with honor, maintaining
                independent judgment, and performing duties with impartiality help to maintain integrity and avoid conflicts of
                interest and hypocrisy.
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                         123

      6.18.3. Loyalty.
            Fidelity, faithfulness, allegiance, and devotion are all synonyms for loyalty. Loyalty is the bond that holds the
            Nation and the U.S. Government together and the balm against dissension and conflict. This ethical value is not
            blind obedience or unquestioning acceptance of the status quo. Loyalty requires careful balance among various
            interests, values, and institutions in the interest of harmony and cohesion.
      6.18.4. Accountability.
            DoD employees are required to accept responsibility for their decisions and the resulting consequences. This
            includes avoiding even the appearance of impropriety. Accountability promotes careful, well-thought-out
            decisions, and limits thoughtless action.
      6.18.5. Fairness.
            Openmindedness and impartiality are important aspects of fairness. DoD employees must be committed to
            justice in the performance of their official duties. Decisions must not be arbitrary, capricious, or biased.
            Individuals must be treated equally and with tolerance.
      6.18.6. Caring.
            Compassion is an essential element of good government. Courtesy and kindness, both to those we serve and to
            those with whom we work, help to ensure individuals are not treated solely as a means to an end. Caring for
            others is the counterbalance against the temptation to pursue the mission at any cost.
      6.18.7. Respect.
            To treat people with dignity, to honor privacy, and to allow self-determination are critical in a government of
            diverse people. Lack of respect leads to a breakdown of loyalty and honesty within a government and brings
            chaos to the international community.
      6.18.8. Promise-Keeping.
            No government can function for long if its commitments are not kept. DoD employees are obligated to keep
            their promises in order to promote trust and cooperation. Because of the importance of promise-keeping, DoD
            employees must only make commitments within their authority.
      6.18.9. Responsible Citizenship.
            Responsible citizenship is the duty of every citizen, especially DoD employees, to exercise discretion. Public
            servants are expected to engage (employ) personal judgment in the performance of official duties within the
            limits of their authority so that the will of the people is respected according to democratic principles. Justice
            must be pursued and injustice must be challenged through accepted means.
      6.18.10. Pursuit of Excellence.
            In public service, competence is only the starting point. DoD employees are expected to set an example of
            superior diligence and commitment. They are expected to strive beyond mediocrity.
6.19. Professional and Unprofessional Relationships.
      Professional relationships are essential to the effective operation of all organizations, military and civilian, but the
      nature of the military mission requires absolute confidence in command and an unhesitating adherence to orders that
      may result in inconvenience, hardships, injury, or death. While personal relationships between Air Force members are
      normally matters of individual choice and judgment, they become matters of official concern when they adversely
      affect or might adversely affect the Air Force by eroding morale, good order, discipline, respect for authority, unit
      cohesion, or mission accomplishment. AFI 36-2909, Professional and Unprofessional Relationships, establishes
      responsibilities for maintaining professional relationships.
      6.19.1. Professional Relationships.
            Professional relationships contribute to the effective operation of the Air Force. The Air Force encourages
            personnel to communicate freely with their superiors regarding their careers and performance, duties, and
            missions. This type of communication enhances morale and discipline and improves the operational
            environment while at the same time preserving proper respect for authority and focus on the mission.
            Participation by members of all grades in organizational activities, such as base intramural, interservice, and
            intraservice athletic competitions, unit-sponsored events, religious activities, community welfare projects, and
            youth programs, enhances morale and contributes to unit cohesion.

      6.19.2. Unprofessional Relationships.
            On or off duty, unprofessional relationships may detract from the authority of superiors or result in, or
            reasonably create the appearance of, favoritism, misuse of office or position, or the abandonment of
            organizational goals for personal interests. Unprofessional relationships can exist between officers, between
            enlisted members, between officers and enlisted members, and between military personnel and civilian
            employees or contractor personnel.
      6.19.3. Fraternization.
            As defined by the Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM), fraternization is a personal relationship between an
            officer and an enlisted member that violates the customary bounds of acceptable behavior in the Air Force and
            prejudices good order and discipline, discredits the Armed Services, or operates to the personal disgrace or
            dishonor of the officer involved. The custom recognizes that officers will not form personal relationships with
            enlisted members on terms of military equality, whether on or off duty. Although the custom originated in an all
            male military, fraternization is gender neutral. Fraternization can occur between males, between females, and
            between males and females. Because of the potential damage fraternization can do to morale, good order,
            discipline, and unit cohesion, fraternization is specifically prohibited in the MCM and punishable under Article
            134 of the UCMJ.
6.20. General Guidelines on Avoiding Unprofessional Relationships Including Fraternization.
      Military experience has shown that certain kinds of personal relationships present a high risk for being (or developing
      into) unprofessional relationships. Unprofessional relationships negatively impact morale and discipline. While some
      personal relationships are not initially unprofessional, they may become unprofessional when circumstances change.
      For example, factors that can change an otherwise permissible relationship into an unprofessional relationship include
      the members‘ relative positions in the organization and the members‘ relative positions in the supervisory and
      command chains. Air Force members, both officer and enlisted, must be sensitive to forming these relationships and
      consider the probable impact of their actions on the Air Force in making their decisions. The rules regarding these
      relationships must be somewhat elastic to accommodate differing conditions. However, the underlying standard is that
      Air Force members are expected to avoid relationships that negatively affect morale and discipline. When economic
      constraints or operational requirements place officers and enlisted members of different grades in close proximity with
      one another (such as combined or joint clubs, joint recreational facilities, or mixed officer and enlisted housing areas),
      military members are expected to maintain professional relationships. Although maintaining professional relationships
      is more difficult under certain circumstances, it does not excuse a member‘s responsibility to maintain standards.
      6.20.1. Relationships Within an Organization.
            Unduly familiar relationships between members in which one member exercises supervisory or command
            authority over the other can easily be or become unprofessional. Similarly, as differences in grades increase,
            even in the absence of a command or supervisory relationship, there may be more risk that the relationship will
            become, or is perceived to be, unprofessional because senior members in military organizations normally
            exercise authority or have some direct or indirect organizational influence over more junior members. The
            danger for abuse of authority is always present. A senior member‘s ability to directly or indirectly influence
            assignments, promotion recommendations, duties, awards, or other privileges and benefits places both the
            senior and junior members in a vulnerable position. Once established, such relationships do not go unnoticed by
            other members of the unit. Service members must also avoid unprofessional relationships (including
            fraternization) between members of different services, particularly in joint service operations, because such
            relationships may have the same impact on morale and discipline as they would for members assigned to the
            same service.
      6.20.2. Relationships with Civilian Employees.
            Civilian employees and contractor personnel are an integral part of the Air Force. They contribute directly to
            readiness and mission accomplishment. Consequently, military members of all grades must maintain
            professional relationships with civilian employees, particularly those whom they supervise or direct. They must
            avoid relationships that adversely affect or reasonably might adversely affect morale, discipline, and respect for
            authority, or that violate law or regulation.
      6.20.3. Dating and Close Friendships.
            Dating, intimate relationships, and close friendships between men and women are subject to the same policy
            considerations as are other relationships. Like any personal relationship, they become a matter of official
            concern when they adversely affect morale, discipline, unit cohesion, respect for authority, or mission
AFPAM36-2241        1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                             125

             accomplishment. Members must recognize that these relationships can adversely affect morale and discipline,
             even when the members are not in the same chain of command or unit. These relationships between superiors
             and subordinates within the same chain of command or supervision invariably cause the perception of
             favoritism or misuse of position, and negatively impact morale, discipline, and unit cohesion.
      6.20.4. Shared Activities.
             Sharing living accommodations, vacations, transportation, and off-duty interests on a frequent or recurring basis
             can be perceived as unprofessional. These types of arrangements often lead to claims of abuse of position or
             favoritism. Often the frequency of these activities or the absence of an official purpose or organizational benefit
             is what causes them to become, or to be perceived as, unprofessional. While an occasional round of golf, game
             of racquetball, or similar activity between a supervisor and subordinate could remain professional, daily or
             weekly occurrences could result in at least the perception of an unprofessional relationship. Similarly, while it
             may be appropriate for a first sergeant to play golf with a different group of officers from his or her organization
             each weekend in order to get to know them better, playing with the same officers every weekend may be, or be
             perceived as, unprofessional.
      6.20.5. Training, Schools, and Professional Military Education (PME).
             Personal relationships between students and instructors or staff in the training and school environment present
             particular risks and are especially likely to result in abuse of position, partiality, or favoritism by instructors or
             staff, or create the appearance of such.
      6.20.6. Other Relationships.
             Other relationships not specifically addressed, depending on the circumstances, can lead to actual or perceived
             favoritism or preferential treatment, and must be avoided. Examples of activities that may adversely impact
             morale, discipline, and respect for authority include gambling, partying with subordinates, joint business
             ventures, or soliciting (or making solicited sales) to members junior in rank, grade, or position.
6.21. Consequences of Unprofessional Conduct.
      Military members are subject to lawful orders. When a military member has been lawfully ordered to cease an
      unprofessional relationship or refrain from certain conduct, the military member is subject to prosecution under the
      UCMJ for violating the order. Similarly, all military members are subject to prosecution for criminal offenses
      committed incidental to an unprofessional relationship (such as gambling, adultery, or assault).
6.22. Responsibilities for Professional Relationships:
      6.22.1. Individuals.
             All members are responsible for respecting authority and maintaining professional relationships. However, the
             senior member (officer or enlisted) in a personal relationship bears primary responsibility for maintaining
             professional relationships. Leadership requires personnel to exercise maturity and judgment and avoid
             relationships that undermine respect for authority or have a negative impact on morale, discipline, or the
             mission. The senior member in a relationship is in the best position to appreciate the effect the relationship
             could have on an organization and is in the best position to terminate or limit the extent of the relationship.
             However, all members should expect to be, and must be, held accountable for how their conduct impacts the Air
             Force.
      6.22.2. Commanders and Supervisors.
             Commanders and supervisors have the authority and responsibility to maintain good order, discipline, and
             morale within their units. They may be held accountable for failing to act in appropriate cases.
6.23. Actions in Response to Unprofessional Relationships.
      Actions are normally the least severe necessary to terminate the unprofessional aspects of a relationship, but a full
      spectrum of administrative actions is available and should be considered. Administrative actions include, but are not
      limited to, counseling; reprimand; creation of an unfavorable information file (UIF); removal from position;
      reassignment; demotion; delay of or removal from a promotion list; adverse or referral comments in performance
      reports; and administrative separation. One or more complementary actions can be taken. Experience has shown that
      counseling is often an effective first step in curtailing unprofessional relationships. More serious cases may warrant
      administrative action or nonjudicial punishment. Instances of actual favoritism, partiality, or misuse of grade or
      position may constitute independent violations of the UCMJ.
126                                                                                    1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
6.24. Financial Responsibility.
      AFI 36-2906, Personal Financial Responsibility, establishes administrative and management guidelines for alleged
      delinquent financial obligations and for processing financial claims against Air Force members. It also outlines basic
      rules for garnishment.
      6.24.1. Responsibilities.
             Military members will:
             6.24.1.1. Pay their just financial obligations in a proper and timely manner.
             6.24.1.2. Provide adequate financial support of a spouse, child or any other relative for which the member
             receives additional support allowances. Members will also comply with the financial support provisions of a
             court order or written support agreement.
             6.24.1.3. Respond to applications for involuntary allotments of pay within the suspense dates established by the
             Defense Finance and Accounting Service.
             6.24.1.4. Comply with rules concerning the government travel charge card program.
      6.24.2. Handling Complaints.
             Complainants are often unfamiliar with Air Force organizational addresses or do not know the member‘s actual
             unit of assignment, and so frequently address correspondence to the installation commander, staff judge
             advocate (SJA), or military personnel flight. The complaint is forwarded for action to the individual‘s
             commander, who attempts to respond within 15 days. If the member has had a permanent change of station, the
             complaint is forwarded to the new commander, and the complainant is notified of the referral. If the member
             has separated with no further military service or has retired, the complainant is notified and informed that the
             member is no longer under Air Force jurisdiction and the Air Force is unable to assist. (Exception: Retired
             members‘ retirement pay can be garnished for child support or alimony obligations.) Commanders must
             actively monitor complaints until they are resolved. Failure to pay debts or support dependents can lead to
             administrative or disciplinary action. If the commander decides the complaint reflects adversely on the member,
             this action should be included in the UIF.
      6.24.3. Personal Financial Management Program (PFMP).
             The Personal Financial Management Program is an Airman and Family Readiness Center program that offers
             information, education, and personal financial counseling to help individuals and families maintain financial
             stability and reach their financial goals. PFMP provides education to all personnel upon arrival at their first duty
             station. PFMP education includes, at minimum, facts about PFMP, checkbook maintenance, budgeting, credit
             buying, state or country liability laws, and local fraudulent business practices. The PFMP also provides
             refresher education for all senior airmen and below upon arrival at a new installation. PFMP services are free.

Section 6E—Ethics and Conflict of Interest Prohibitions
6.25. Overview.
      DoD policy requires a single, uniform source of standards on ethical conduct and ethics guidance be maintained within
      DoD. Each DoD agency will implement and administer a comprehensive ethics program to ensure compliance.
6.26. Bribery and Graft.
      DoD employees and military members are directly or indirectly prohibited from giving, offering, promising,
      demanding, seeking, receiving, accepting, or agreeing to receive anything of value to influence any official act. They
      are prohibited from influencing the commission of fraud on the United States, inducing commitment or omission of
      any act in violation of a lawful duty, or from influencing testimony given. They are prohibited from accepting
      anything of value for, or because of, any official act performed or to be performed. These prohibitions do not apply to
      the payment of witness fees authorized by law or certain travel and subsistence expenses.
6.27. Compensation from Other Sources.
      DoD employees and military members are prohibited from receiving pay or allowance or supplements of pay or
      benefits from any source other than the United States for the performance of official service or duties unless
      specifically authorized by law. A task or job performed outside normal work hours does not necessarily allow
      employees to accept payment for performing it. If the undertaking is part of one‘s official duties, pay for its
      performance may not be accepted from any source other than the United States regardless of when it was performed.
AFPAM36-2241        1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                          127

6.28. Additional Pay or Allowance.
      DoD employees and military members may not receive additional pay or allowance for disbursement of public money
      or for the performance of any other service or duty unless specifically authorized by law. Subject to certain limitations,
      civilian DoD employees may hold two distinctly different federal government positions and receive salaries for both if
      the duties of each are performed. Absent specific authority, however, military members may not do so because any
      arrangement by a military member for rendering services to the federal government in another position is incompatible
      with the military member‘s actual or potential military duties. The fact that a military member may have leisure hours
      during which no official duty is performed does not alter the result.
6.29. Commercial Dealings Involving Department of Defense Personnel.
      On or off duty, a DoD employee or military member shall not knowingly solicit or make solicited sales to DoD
      personnel who are junior in rank, grade, or position, or to the family members of such personnel. In the absence of
      coercion or intimidation, this does not prohibit the sale or lease of a DoD employee‘s or military member‘s
      noncommercial personal or real property or commercial sales solicited and made in a retail establishment during off-
      duty employment. This prohibition includes the solicited sale of insurance, stocks, mutual funds, real estate, cosmetics,
      household supplies, vitamins, and other goods or services. Solicited sales by the spouse or other household member of
      a senior-ranking person to a junior person are not specifically prohibited but may give the appearance that the DoD
      employee or military member is using public office for personal gain. If in doubt, consult an ethics counselor. Several
      related prohibitions in this area include:
      6.29.1. Engaging in off-duty employment or outside activities that detract from readiness or pose a security risk, as
      determined by the employee‘s or member‘s commander or supervisor.
      6.29.2. Engaging in outside employment or activities that conflict with official duties.
      6.29.3. Receiving honoraria for performing official duties or for speaking, teaching, or writing that relates to one‘s
      official duties.
      6.29.4. Misusing an official position, such as improper endorsements or improper use of nonpublic information.
      6.29.5. Certain post-government service employment. See DoD 5500.7-R, Chapter 9, for specific guidance.
6.30. Gifts from Foreign Governments.
      AFI 51-901, Gifts from Foreign Governments, requires all Air Force military and civilian personnel, and their
      dependents, to report gifts from foreign governments if the gift, or combination of gifts, at one presentation exceeds a
      U.S. retail value of $305. Gifts and gift reports are due to the Air Force Personnel Center‘s Promotions, Evaluations,
      and Recognition Division, Special Trophies and Awards Section, within 60 days of receiving the gift. This
      requirement includes gifts that recipients want to keep for official use or display. The United States Attorney General
      may bring a civil action in any court of the United States against any person who knowingly solicits or accepts a gift
      from a foreign government that is not approved by Congress, or who fails to deposit or report such a gift, as required
      by AFI 51-901. Failure to report gifts valued in excess of $305 could result in a penalty not to exceed the retail value
      of the gift plus $5,000. Note: The limit on gifts from foreign governments is set by Congress and changes annually. Be
      sure to confirm the most current limit with your ethics counselor when considering foreign gift issues.
6.31. Contributions or Presents to Superiors:
      6.31.1. On an occasional basis, including any occasion when gifts are traditionally given or exchanged, the following
      may be given to an official supervisor by a subordinate or other employees receiving less pay:
            6.31.1.1. Items, other than cash, with an aggregate market value of $10 or less.
            6.31.1.2. Items such as food and refreshments to be shared in the office among several employees.
            6.31.1.3. Personal hospitality provided at a residence and items given in connection with personal hospitality,
            which is of a type and value customarily provided by the employee to personal friends.
      6.31.2. A gift appropriate to the occasion may be given to recognize special, infrequent occasions of personal
      significance, such as marriage, illness, or the birth or adoption of a child. Contributions or presents are also
      permissible upon occasions that terminate a subordinate-official supervisor relationship, such as retirement, separation,
      or reassignment. Regardless of the number of employees contributing, the market value of the gift cannot exceed $300.
      Even though contributions are voluntary, the maximum contribution one DoD employee may solicit from another
      cannot exceed $10.

6.32. Federal Government Resources.
      Federal government resources, including personnel, equipment, and property, will be used by DoD employees and
      military members for official purposes only. Agencies may, however, permit employees or military members to make
      limited personal use of resources other than personnel, such as a computer, calculators, libraries, etc., if the use:
      6.32.1. Does not adversely affect the performance of official duties by the employee, military member, or other DoD
      personnel.
      6.32.2. Is of reasonable duration and frequency and is made during the employee‘s or military member‘s personal
      time, such as after duty hours or during lunch periods.
      6.32.3. Serves a legitimate public interest, such as supporting local charities or volunteer services to the community.
      6.32.4. Does not reflect adversely on the DoD.
       6.32.5. Creates no significant additional cost to the DoD or government agency.
6.33. Communication Systems.
      Federal Government communication systems and equipment including telephones, fax machines, electronic mail, and
      Internet systems will be used for official use and authorized purposes only. Official use includes emergency
      communications and, when approved by commanders in the interest of morale and welfare, may include
      communications by DoD personnel deployed for extended periods on official DoD business. Authorized purposes
      include brief communication while traveling on government business to notify family members of official
      transportation or schedule changes. Also authorized are personal communications from the DoD employee‘s or
      military member‘s usual workplace that are most reasonably made while at the workplace, such as checking in with
      spouse or minor children; scheduling doctor, auto, or home repair appointments; brief Internet searches; and emailing
      directions to visiting relatives, when the agency designee permits. However, many restrictions do apply. Consult DoD
      5500.7-R for additional guidance; then consult the organizational point of contact.
6.34. Gambling, Betting, and Lotteries.
      While on federally owned or leased property or while on duty, a DoD employee or military member will not
      participate in any gambling activity except:
      6.34.1. Activities by organizations composed primarily of DoD personnel or their dependents for the benefit of welfare
      funds for their own members or for the benefit of other DoD personnel or their dependents, subject to local law and
      DoD 5500.7-R.
      6.34.2. Private wagers among DoD personnel if based on a personal relationship and transacted entirely within
      assigned government living quarters and subject to local laws.
      6.34.3. Lotteries authorized by any state from licensed vendors.
Section 6F—Political Activities
6.35. Overview.
      DoD policy encourages Armed Forces members to carry out the obligations of a citizen. While on active duty,
      however, members are prohibited from engaging in certain political activities as outlined in DoDD 1344.10, Political
      Activities by Members of the Armed Forces, and AFI 51-902, Political Activities by Members of the U.S. Air Force.
6.36. Rights.
      In general, a member on active duty may register, vote, and express his or her personal opinion on political candidates
      and issues, but not as a representative of the Armed Forces. Members may make monetary contributions to a political
      organization, but cannot make campaign contributions to a partisan political candidate. They may attend partisan and
      nonpartisan political meetings or rallies as spectators when not in uniform.
6.37. Prohibitions.
      A member on active duty will not use his or her official authority or influence to interfere with an election, affect the
      course or outcome of an election, solicit votes for a particular candidate or issue, or require or solicit political
      contributions from others. A member cannot participate in partisan political management, campaigns, or conventions.
      A member may not be a candidate for, or hold, civil office except as outlined in paragraph 6.37.1.
      6.37.1. Candidacy for Elected Office.
                A member may not campaign as a nominee or as a candidate for nomination. However, enlisted members may
AFPAM36-2241           1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                             129

                seek and hold nonpartisan civil office, such as a notary public or school board member, neighborhood planning
                commission, or similar local agency, as long as such office is held in a private capacity and does not interfere
                with the performance of military duties. There are also specific exceptions to the prohibition on holding elected
                office that permit reservists in certain elected or appointed civil offices in federal, state, and local government to
                remain in office when called to active duty for no more than 270 days.
      6.37.2. Additional Specific Prohibitions.
                A member may not:
                6.37.2.1. Allow, or cause to be published, partisan political articles signed or authorized by the member for
                soliciting votes for or against a partisan political party or candidate.
                6.37.2.2. Serve in any official capacity or be listed as a sponsor of a partisan political club.
                6.37.2.3. Speak before a partisan political gathering of any kind for promoting a partisan political party or
                candidate.
                6.37.2.4. Conduct a political opinion survey under the auspices of a partisan political group or distribute
                partisan political literature.
                6.37.2.5. Perform clerical or other duties for a partisan political committee during a campaign or on election
                day.
                6.37.2.6. March or ride in a partisan political parade.
                6.37.2.7. Use contemptuous words against the officeholders described in 10 U.S.C., Section 888, Contempt
                Toward Officials (officers only).
                6.37.2.8. Display a large political sign, banner, or poster on the top or side of his or her private vehicle (as
                distinguished from a political sticker).
6.38. Voting.
      The DoD Federal Voting Assistance Program is responsible for administering the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens
      Absentee Voting Act. Specifically, the DoD Federal Voting Assistance Program mission is to inform and educate U.S.
      citizens worldwide of their right to vote; foster voting participation; and protect the integrity of and enhance the
      electoral process at the Federal, state, and local levels. The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act
      requires that states and territories allow certain groups of citizens, including active duty military members and their
      families, to register and vote absentee in elections for federal offices. In many states, laws exist that allow military
      members and their families to vote absentee in state and local elections. The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens
      Absentee Voting Act requires each federal department and agency with personnel covered by the act to have a voting
      assistance program. Critical to the success of this program are the voting assistance officers. These individuals,
      military and civilian, are responsible for providing accurate nonpartisan voting information and assistance to all of the
      citizens they are appointed to help. They aid in ensuring citizens understand their voting rights, to include providing
      procedures on how to vote absentee.
6.39. Dissident and Protest Activities.
      Air Force commanders have the inherent authority and responsibility to take action to ensure the mission is performed
      and to maintain good order and discipline. This authority and responsibility includes placing lawful restriction on
      dissident and protest activities. Air Force commanders must preserve the service member‘s right of expression to the
      maximum extent possible, consistent with good order, discipline, and national security. To properly balance these
      interests, commanders must exercise calm and prudent judgment and should consult with the SJA.
      6.39.1. Possessing or Distributing Printed Materials.
                Air Force members may not distribute or post any printed or written material other than publications of an
                official government agency or base-related activity within any Air Force installation without permission of the
                installation commander or that commander‘s designee. Members who violate this prohibition are subject to
                disciplinary action under Article 92 of the UCMJ.
      6.39.2. Writing for Publications.
                Air Force members may not write for unofficial publications during duty hours. An unofficial publication, such
                as an ―underground newspaper,‖ may not be produced using government or nonappropriated fund property or
130                                                                                   1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
            supplies. Any publication that contains language, the utterance of which is punishable by the UCMJ or other
            federal laws, may subject a person involved in its printing, publishing, or distribution to prosecution or other
            disciplinary action.
      6.39.3. Off-Limits Action.
            Action may be initiated under AFJI 31-213, Armed Forces Disciplinary Control Boards and Off-Installation
            Liaison and Operations, to make certain establishments off limits. An establishment runs the risk of being off
            limits if its activities include counseling service members to refuse to perform their duties or to desert, or when
            involved in acts with a significant adverse effect on health, welfare, or morale of military members.
      6.39.4. Prohibited Activities.
            Military personnel must reject participation in organizations that espouse supremacist causes; attempt to create
            illegal discrimination based on race, creed, color, sex, religion, or national origin; advocate the use of force or
            violence; or otherwise engage in the effort to deprive individuals of their civil rights. Active participation, such
            as publicly demonstrating or rallying, fundraising, recruiting and training members, organizing or leading such
            organizations, or otherwise engaging in activities the commander finds to be detrimental to good order,
            discipline, or mission accomplishment, is incompatible with military service and prohibited. Members who
            violate this prohibition are subject to disciplinary action under Article 92 of the UCMJ.
      6.39.5. Demonstrations and Similar Activities.
            Demonstrations or other activities within an Air Force installation that could result in interfering with or
            preventing the orderly accomplishment of a mission of the installation or which present a clear danger to
            loyalty, discipline, or morale of members of the Armed Forces are prohibited and are punishable under Article
            92 of the UCMJ. Air Force members are prohibited from participating in demonstrations when they are on duty,
            in a foreign country, in uniform, involved in activities that constitute a breach of law and order, or when
            violence is likely to result.
6.40. Public Statements.
      When making public statements, AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Responsibilities and Management, governs members.
      Each Air Force member has a personal responsibility for the success of the Air Force Public Affairs Program. As
      representatives of the service in both official and unofficial contact with the public, members have many opportunities
      to contribute to positive public opinions toward the Air Force. Therefore, each person must strive to make contacts
      show the highest standards of conduct and reflect the Air Force core values.
      6.40.1. Do.
            Specifically, each Air Force member is responsible for obtaining the necessary review and clearance, starting
            with public affairs, before releasing any proposed statement, text, or imagery to the public. This includes digital
            products being loaded on an unrestricted Web site. Members must ensure the information revealed, whether
            official or unofficial, is appropriate for release according to classification requirements in DoDI 5200.01, DoD
            Information Security Program and Protection of Sensitive Compartmented Information, and AFPD 31-4,
            Information Security.
      6.40.2. Don’t.
            Air Force members must not use their Air Force association, official title, or position to promote, endorse, or
            benefit any profit-making agency. This does not prohibit members from assuming character or modeling roles
            in commercial advertisement during their nonduty hours; however, they cannot wear their uniform or allow
            their Air Force title or position to be affixed to the advertisement in any manner or imply Air Force
            endorsement of the product or service being promoted. Additionally, they must not make any commitment to
            provide official Air Force information to any non-DoD member or agency, including news media, before
            obtaining approval through command or public affairs channels.
6.41. Conclusion.
      This chapter explained Air Force standards of conduct. NCOs must learn these standards well enough to be able to
      clearly explain them to subordinates, observe these standards, and always enforce their observation by other members.
      Used in concert with information presented in Chapters 5 and 19, this information covered essential issues vital to
      good order and discipline and mission effectiveness.

                                   ENFORCING STANDARDS AND LEGAL ISSUES


Section 7A—Overview
7.1. Introduction.
      Air Force commanders at all levels are required to continuously evaluate force readiness and organizational economy,
      efficiency and effectiveness. The inspection system provides the commander with a credible, independent assessment
      process to measure the capabilities of assigned forces. Supervisors at all levels play an integral part in this process
      through continual assessment of personnel, programs and the areas of responsibilities they supervise. Furthermore,
      when systematic, programmatic or procedural weaknesses are suspected, or to further ensure resources are used
      effectively and efficiently, Airmen at all levels may visit the Inspector General to report these areas as well as potential
      fraud, waste or abuse cases. This chapter provides information on the Air Force Inspection System, the Inspector
      General Complaints Program, and individual standards and punitive actions. All four areas are necessary to enable the
      Air Force to fulfill our national security obligations efficiently and effectively.
Section 7B—The Air Force Inspection System (AFIS)
7.2. Purpose.
      The Inspector General‘s (TIG) mission is defined in HAF MD 1-20, The Inspector General, and AFPD 90-2, Inspector
      General—The Inspection System. The overall purpose of the AFIS is to enable and strengthen commanders‘
      effectiveness and efficiency, motivate and promote military discipline, improve unit performance and management
      excellence up and down the chain of command, in units and staffs, as well as identify issues interfering with
      effectiveness, efficiency, compliance, discipline, readiness, performance, surety and management excellence. TIG
      reports on readiness, economy, efficiency, and state of discipline of Air Force organizations to the Secretary of the Air
      Force (SECAF) and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF).
7.3. Philosophy.
      Inspection is an inherent function of command exercised at every level to evaluate readiness, economy, efficiency, and
      state of discipline. Inspection preparation, if not directly aligned with mission readiness, is inherently wasteful. Units
      will be inspection ready when commanders focus on mission readiness and on building a culture of disciplined
      compliance in which every Airman does his/her job right the first time when no one‘s looking. The intent of the
      Inspector General is to continuously improve the AFIS so there is an ever-shrinking difference—both real and
      perceived—between mission readiness and inspection readiness. Each major command (MAJCOM) commander and
      Wing commander will appoint an inspector general (IG) who will establish an inspection program consistent with
      MAJCOM mission requirements to inspect unit effectiveness, surety and other inspection program elements.
      MAJCOM IGs develop applicable guidelines, procedures and criteria for conducting inspections.
7.4. Inspection Types:
      7.4.1. Commander’s Inspection Program. A validated and trusted commander‘s inspection program is the
      cornerstone of the AFIS. The Wing IG is responsible to validate and verify self-assessment programs and
      independently assess the performance of organizations below the Wing level. The commander‘s inspection program
      should give the Wing Commander, subordinate commanders and wing Airmen the right information at the right time
      to assess risk, identify areas of improvement, determine root cause and precisely focus limited resources; all aligned
      with the commander‘s priorities and on the commander‘s timeline. commander‘s inspection program also facilitates
      requests for targeted assistance from the MAJCOM/CC and staff when and where needed. The commander‘s
      inspection program produces two outputs: the Wing Commander‘s Inspection Report and Management Internal
      Control Toolset data. These outputs provide critical data to HAF and MAJCOM staffs about the adequacy of policy,
      training, manpower, funds, equipment and facilities.
      7.4.2. Unit Effectiveness Inspection. The unit effectiveness inspection integrates elements of compliance and
      readiness with new inspection elements to create a new IG inspection of unit effectiveness. Conducted by MAJCOM
      IGs and the Air Force Inspection Agency on Wings and Wing-Equivalents, the unit effectiveness inspection is a
      continual evaluation of performance throughout the inspection period—a photo album versus a snapshot. The unit
      effectiveness inspection inspects the following four Major Graded Areas: Managing Resources, Leading People,
      Improving the Unit and Executing the Mission. The unit effectiveness inspection validates and verifies a Wing‘s
      commander‘s inspection program for accuracy and adequacy, and provides an independent assessment of the Wing‘s
      resource management, leadership, process improvement efforts and ability to execute the mission. A unit
132                                                                                 1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
      effectiveness inspection is a years-long, continual inspection of the unit‘s effectiveness, and is intended to help the
      Wing Commander understand the areas of greatest risk from undetected non-compliance. The next inspection period
      begins immediately after the close-out of the previous unit effectiveness inspection report. (See Figure 7.1.)
  Figure 7.1. UEI Sequence of Events.




      7.4.3. Nuclear Surety Inspection (NSI).
            MAJCOM IG teams evaluate a unit‘s management of nuclear resources against approved safety, security and
            reliability standards. Teams evaluate logistics airlift units with nuclear weapons transport missions by observing
            loading, transporting, unloading and custody transfer procedures of representative types of weapons. The unit‘s
            proficiency is determined by using war reserve (WR) weapons when possible. Training weapons or weapon
            system simulations are used when WR assets are not available. The final rating is based on the nature, severity
            and number of findings noted during the inspection. Assigned to units is a rating of Satisfactory, Satisfactory
            (Support Unsatisfactory) (for deficiencies outside the control of the commander), or Unsatisfactory. If a unit
            receives an overall Unsatisfactory, the unit will receive another inspection within 90 days. If the unit does not
            achieve a Satisfactory on the reinspection, the MAJCOM commander must approve the unit‘s continued nuclear
            weapons related mission.
7.5. Inspection Elements:
      7.5.1. Self-Assessment Program.
            The self-assessment program reports compliance with requirements listed in self-assessment checklists to the
            chain of command and appropriate staffs. Higher headquarters functionals populate self-assessment checklists
            with compliance requirements from their publications and publish self-assessment checklists in the management
            internal control toolset. Then, as part of the Commander‘s Inspection Program, Airmen report compliance and
            non-compliance with self-assessment checklists through management internal control toolset. Commanders and
            functionals throughout the chain of command can monitor programs for real-time compliance and trends using
            management internal control toolset. Self-assessment checklists are created by functional experts to help
            Airmen understand what‘s most important, and to provide an efficient means of communicating compliance or
            non-compliance up the chain of command and appropriate staffs. Compliance with the items in a self-
            assessment checklist does not relieve individual Airmen from knowing the requirements of their programs and
            complying with guidance in Air Force Instructions and other policy documents.
      7.5.2. Management Inspection Control Toolset.
            Management internal control toolset is a web-based program used by Airmen to accomplish self-assessments of
            program management and compliance with higher headquarters directives. Management internal control toolset
            provides the supervisor and command chain, from Sq/CC to SECAF, tiered visibility into user-selected
AFPAM36-2241        1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                        133

            compliance reports and program status. Management internal control toolset also allows Functional Area
            Managers the ability to monitor unit performance, helping them improve policy and guidance.

      7.5.3. Inspector General’s Evaluation Management System.
            Inspector general‘s evaluation management system is the IG‘s database for the Air Force Inspection System.
            MAJCOM/IGs will use inspector general‘s evaluation management system to record the unit‘s overall rating,
            identify deficiencies, track corrective action plans, and post the final inspection report.
      7.5.4. Grading System.
            The AFIS uses the five-tier rating scale of Outstanding, Excellent, Satisfactory, Marginal, and Unsatisfactory.
            The IG Team Chief determines the rating based on a variety of inputs including: observations, interviews,
            audits, and task evaluations.
7.6. Gatekeepers.
      Gatekeepers at all levels must ensure the inspection system is able to independently and efficiently inspect units on
      behalf of the command chain. Gatekeepers ensure a commander‘s priorities take precedence over nonmission-essential
      activities of any unit/organization. Gatekeepers have the authority to approve or disapprove, schedule, deconflict and
      eliminate duplication between all inspection-type activities on behalf of their commander. Gatekeepers do not have
      authority to approve or disapprove The Judge Advocate General (TJAG) Article 6 inspections, The Adjutant General
      (TAG)-directed audits, TIG-directed AFIA/SAF/IG inspections, or inspection-type activity conducted by properly
      authorized DoD or other United States Government (USG) agencies (for example, Office of Inspector General (OIG),
      DoD; Government Accountability Office (GAO), Defense Information System Agency (DISA), and the Defense
      Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). In these cases, gatekeepers should attempt to deconflict the inspections by offering
      optimum windows for the appropriate units.
7.7. TIG Brief.
      AFIA publishes TIG Brief (Air Force Recurring Publication [AFRP] 90-1) which is available electronically online and
      provides authoritative guidance and information to commanders, IGs, inspectors, and Air Force supervisors and
      leaders at all levels of command. Anyone may submit articles to AFIA/PI. Articles should relate to anticipated or
      actual problems, recommendations to improve management, safety, security, inspection or operational techniques,
      cross tell of lessons learned, best practices, or contemporary issues of interest to the Air Force.

Section 7C—Inspector General Complaints Program
7.8. Program Policy and Mission Focus:
      The Air Force IG Complaints Program is a leadership tool that indicates where command involvement is needed to
      correct systematic, programmatic, or procedural weaknesses, and to ensure resources are used effectively and
      efficiently; resolves problems affecting the Air Force mission promptly and objectively; creates an atmosphere of trust
      in which issues can be objectively and fully resolved without retaliation or fear of reprisal; and assists commanders in
      instilling confidence in Air Force leadership. The primary charge of the IG is to sustain a credible Air Force IG system
      by ensuring the existence of responsive complaint investigations, and fraud, waste, and abuse (FWA) programs
      characterized by objectivity, integrity, and impartiality. Only the IG may investigate allegations of reprisal under the
      Military Whistleblower‘s Protection Act. The IG ensures the concerns of Air Force active duty, Reserve, and Guard
      members; civilian employees; family members; retirees; and the best interests of the Air Force are addressed through
      objective fact-finding.
7.9. Installation Inspector General Program.
      The concept of separate, full-time installation IGs was implemented to remove any perceived conflict of interest, lack
      of independence, or apprehension by Air Force personnel. This came as a result of the previous practice of assigning
      chain of command and IG roles to the same official. The installation IG is organized as a staff function reporting
      directly to the installation commander.
      7.9.1. IG Role.
            IGs are the ―eyes and ears‖ of the commander. They execute the commander‘s inspection program, validating
            and verifying unit self-assessments and providing the commander an independent assessment of unit
            effectiveness; they inform the commander of potential areas of concern as reflected by trends; they function as
            the fact finder and honest broker in the resolution of complaints; they educate and train commanders and
            members of the base population on their rights and responsibilities in regard to the Air Force IG system; and
134                                                                                      1 OCTOBER 2013            AFPAM36-2241
                they help commanders prevent, detect, and correct FWA and mismanagement. Personal complaints and FWA
                disclosures help commanders discover and correct problems that affect the productivity and morale of assigned
                personnel. Resolving the underlying cause of a complaint may prevent more severe symptoms or costly
                consequences, such as reduced performance, accidents, poor quality work, poor morale, or loss of resources.
                Even though allegations may not be substantiated, the evidence or investigation findings may reveal systemic
                morale or other problems that impede efficiency and mission effectiveness.
          7.9.2. Investigations Not Covered and Complaints Not Appropriate.
                The following are not covered under the IG complaint resolution program:
                7.9.2.1. Administrative inquiries or investigations governed by other policy directives and instructions. These
                inquiries and investigations include:
                7.9.2.1.1. Commander-directed inquiries and investigations.
                7.9.2.1.2. Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) or security forces investigations.
                7.9.2.1.3. Investigations of civilian employees who have specific appeal rights under law or labor union
                agreements.
                7.9.2.2. Investigations under the authority of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) or the Manual for
                Courts-Martial (MCM), line of duty or report of survey investigations, quality assurance in the Air Force
                medical service boards, Air Force mishap or safety investigations, military equal opportunity (MEO) treatment
                or civilian equal employment opportunity (EEO) programs, and medical incident investigations.
                7.9.2.3. Matters normally addressed through other established grievance or appeal channels unless there is
                evidence these channels mishandled the matter or process. If a policy directive or instruction provides a specific
                means of redress or appeal to a grievance, complainants must exhaust these means before filing an IG
                complaint. Complainants must provide some relevant evidence that the process was mishandled or handled
                prejudicially before IG channels will process a complaint of mishandling. Dissatisfaction or disagreement with
                the outcome or findings of an alternative grievance or appeal process is not a sufficient basis to warrant IG
                investigation.
                Note: AFI 90-301, Inspector General Complaints Resolution, Table 3.6, provides a list of matters not
                appropriate for the IG complaint resolution program.
          7.9.3. Filing an IG Complaint.
                Air Force military members and civilian employees have a duty to promptly report FWA or gross
                mismanagement; a violation of law, policy, procedures, or regulations; an injustice; abuse of authority,
                inappropriate conduct, or misconduct; and a deficiency or like condition to an appropriate supervisor or
                commander, to an IG or other appropriate inspector, or through an established grievance channel. Complainants
                should attempt to resolve the issues at the lowest possible level using command channels before addressing
                them to a higher level or the IG. The immediate supervisory command chain can often resolve complaints more
                quickly and effectively than a higher level not familiar with the situation. Use the IG system when referral to the
                chain of command is futile, and there is fear of reprisal.
          7.9.4. Procedures for Filing a Complaint.
                Table 7.1 outlines the procedures for filing an IG complaint. Complainants complete an AF IMT 102, Inspector
                General Personal and Fraud, Waste and Abuse Complaint Registration, briefly outlining the facts and relevant
                background information related to the issue or complaint. AFI 90-301 outlines the procedures. Complainants
                may also file anonymously through an Air Force FWA hotline, the Defense hotline, or directly with an IG.
Table 7.1. How to File an IG Complaint.
   A                                                                 B
  Step                                                             Action
   1         If unable to resolve the complaint in supervisory channels, review AFI 90-301, Table 3.6, to determine if the
             complaint should be filed with the IG. Complainants should file a complaint if they reasonably believe
             inappropriate conduct has occurred or a violation of law, policy, procedure, or regulation has been committed.
      2      Complete the personal data information on AF IMT 102 (typed or printed legibly), the preferred format for
             submitting complaints, so it may easily be reproduced.
      3      Briefly outline the facts and relevant background information related to the issue or complaint on AF IMT 102
             in chronological order.
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                            135

  A                                                               B
 Step                                                          Action
  4      List the allegations of wrongdoing briefly, in general terms, and provide supporting narrative detail including
         chronology and documents later when interviewed. Allegations should be written as bullets and should answer:
         1. What violation was committed?
         2. What law, regulation, procedure, or policy was violated?
         3. When did the violation occur?
         4. Who committed the violation?
  5      If more than 60 days have elapsed since the alleged conduct occurred, the complainant should also include:
         1. The date the complainant first became aware of the conduct?
         2. How did the complainant become aware of the conduct?
         3. Why did the complainant delay filing the complaint?
  6      Submit the completed AF IMT 102 to any Air Force IG and set up a follow-on meeting to discuss the complaint.
  7      If the IG is named in the complaint, contact the next higher-level IG.
      7.9.5. Complainants’ Rights.
            Complainants have the right to:
            7.9.5.1. File an IG complaint at any level without notifying or following the chain of command.
            7.9.5.2. File a complaint with an IG without fear of reprisal.
            7.9.5.3. Request withdrawal of their complaint in writing; however, IGs may still look into the allegations at
            their discretion.
            7.9.5.4. Request the next higher level IG review their case within 90 days of receiving a final IG response. Must
            give specific reasons as to why the complainant believes the original investigation was not valid or adequate;
            simply disagreeing with the findings is not sufficient for additional IG review.
            7.9.5.5. Submit complaints anonymously.
            7.9.5.6. Submit a complaint on behalf of another individual or even when not the wronged party.
            7.9.5.7. Request whistleblower protection after making or planning to make a protected communication.
            7.9.5.7.1. Reprisal occurs when a responsible management official takes (or threatens to take) an unfavorable
            personnel action; or withholds (or threatens to withhold) a favorable personnel action, to retaliate against a
            member of the armed forces who made, or prepared to make, a protected communication. Any lawful
            communication, regardless of the subject, to an IG or Congress, is considered protected. Additionally, it is a
            protected communication when a member who reasonably believes he/she has evidence of a violation of law or
            regulation (regardless of whether he/she is the victim), discloses this to an authorized recipient in the form of a
            lawful communication.
            7.9.5.7.2. 10 USC Section 1034, Protected Communications; Prohibition of Retaliatory Personnel Actions, also
            states that a military member may not be restricted or prohibited from making a lawful communication to the IG
            or a member of Congress (for example, making a protected communication). Restriction can result from either
            private or public statements that may reasonably discourage Air Force members from contacting the IG or a
            member of Congress. For example, a first sergeant who directs a member to stay within his chain of command
            because the member told his supervisor he was going to complain to his Congressman about an upcoming
            deployment has probably restricted.
            7.9.5.7.3. Improper mental health evaluation (MHE) referral cases typically involve improper procedures. AFI
            44-109, Mental Health, Confidentiality, and Military Law, paragraph 4.1. states, ―Supervisory personnel,
            including commanders, may encourage Air Force members to voluntarily seek mental health care…supervisors
            and commanders may not, however, under any circumstances attempt to coerce members to voluntarily seek a
            mental health evaluation.‖ An individual‘s indication on an MHE intake form that he or she was there
            voluntarily, while compelling, was (and still is) not necessarily outcome determinative.
            7.9.5.7.4. The DoD Inspector General provides a quarterly report to Congress detailing the Services‘ IG
            allegations of improper MHEs, reprisal, and restricted (the latter two, if substantiated, amounts to a violation of
            Federal law). In the Air Force, most allegations in these three areas are against first sergeants and senior enlisted
            personnel.
136                                                                                 1 OCTOBER 2013        AFPAM36-2241
      7.9.6. Complainants’ Responsibilities.
            Complainants must file within 60 days of learning of the alleged wrong. IG complaints not reported within 60
            days may seriously impede the gathering of evidence and testimony. The IG may dismiss a complaint if, given
            the nature of the alleged wrong and the passage of time, there is reasonable probability that insufficient
            information can be gathered to make a determination, or no special Air Force interests exist to justify
            investigating the matter. Complainants must cooperate with investigators by providing factual and relevant
            information regarding the issues. Complainants must understand that they are submitting official statements;
            therefore, they remain subject to punitive action for knowingly making false statements and submitting other
            unlawful communications.
      7.9.7. Confidentiality Policy.
            The IG makes every effort to protect the identity of complainants from anyone outside IG channels. IGs may
            release the name of a complainant only on an official need-to-know basis. Investigating officers do not divulge
            a complainant‘s name to a subject or witness or permit them to read the complaint without the IG‘s or
            appointing authority‘s written permission.

Section 7D—Individual Standards
7.10. Enforcing Individual Standards—Administrative Actions.
      When leadership by example, one-on-one counseling, and performance feedback fail to convince an individual to
      conform to standards, it may be appropriate to take more severe actions. The next step in many cases is to take one of
      several administrative actions. The following paragraphs discuss actions a commander may take to correct an
      individual‘s behavior without resorting to punishment under the UCMJ.
7.11. Unfavorable Information File (UIF) .
      The UIF is an official record of unfavorable (derogatory) information about an individual and documents that are
      administrative, judicial, or nonjudicial censures concerning the member‘s performance, responsibility, and behavior.
      7.11.1. UIF Contents.
            The following documents must be filed in a UIF:
            7.11.1.1. Suspended or unsuspended Article 15 punishment of more than 1 month (31 days or more).
            7.11.1.2. Court-martial conviction.
            7.11.1.3. A civilian conviction where the penalty is confinement of 1 year or more.
            7.11.1.4. Placement on the control roster (see paragraph 7.12).
      Note: The commander may refer other documented unfavorable information for optional filing in the UIF. This
      includes documentation such as other Article 15 punishments not listed above; a record of failure to discharge
      financial obligations in a timely manner; a record of confirmed discrimination; or a written administrative reprimand,
      admonishment, or counseling.
      7.11.2. Initiating and Controlling UIFs.
            Commanders at all levels; vice commanders, staff directors, and directors at MAJCOMs, field operating
            agencies (FOA), and direct reporting units (DRU); and the senior Air Force officer assigned to a joint command
            have the authority to establish, remove, or destroy UIFs. Commanders refer optional documents (letters of
            admonishment [LOA], letters of counseling [LOC], and letters of reprimand [LOR]) to the offending member
            along with an AF IMT 1058, Unfavorable Information File Action, before establishing a UIF. Note: Mandatory
            items, such as Articles 15 with punishment exceeding 1 month and court-martial or civilian court convictions,
            are not referred via AF IMT 1058. The individual has 3 duty days to acknowledge the intended actions and
            provide pertinent information before the commander makes the final decision on placing optional documents in
            the UIF. The commander advises the individual of his or her final decision; and, if the commander decides to
            file the information in a UIF, the individual‘s response is also filed.
      7.11.3. Accessing UIFs.
            In the course of their Air Force duties, the following individuals are authorized access to a member‘s UIF: the
            member, commander, first sergeant, enlisted performance report (EPR) reporting and rating officials, military
            personnel flight (MPF) personnel, IG, inspection team, judge advocate, paralegal, MEO personnel, Alcohol and
AFPAM36-2241         1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                      137

            Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT) Program personnel, AFOSI, and security forces personnel.
            Commanders review unit UIFs within 90 days of assuming command. UIFs are also reviewed when individuals
            are considered for promotion, reenlistment, permanent change of station (PCS), permanent change of
            assignment (PCA), and voluntary or mandatory reclassification or retraining.
      7.11.4. Removing UIFs or Documents Within UIFs.
            Commanders keep the UIF and its documents for the disposition period unless early removal is clearly
            warranted. AFI 36-2907, Unfavorable Information File (UIF) Program, contains additional guidance on
            disposition dates. Commanders initiate removal action via AF IMT 1058, and the individual acknowledges the
            action.
7.12. Control Roster.
      The control roster is a rehabilitative tool commanders may use to establish a 6-month observation period for
      individuals whose duty performance is substandard or who fail to meet or maintain Air Force standards of conduct,
      bearing, and integrity, on or off duty. A brief incident of substandard performance or an isolated breach of standards,
      not likely to be repeated, should not usually result in an individual‘s placement on the control roster. Commanders
      should consider prior incidents, acts, failures, counseling, and rehabilitative efforts. Commanders inform members
      listed on the control roster that their performance and behavior must improve or they will face more severe
      administrative action or punishment.
      7.12.1. Use.
            A commander may direct an EPR before entering or removing an individual from the roster, or both. The
            commander cannot place an individual on the roster as a substitute for more appropriate administrative, judicial,
            or nonjudicial action. Being on the roster does not shield an individual from other actions. An individual cannot
            remain on the roster for more than 6 consecutive months. If a member is not rehabilitated in this time, the
            commander initiates more severe action.
      7.12.2. Initiating and Maintaining the Control Roster.
            A commander initiates control roster action on AF IMT 1058. The commander requests that the individual
            acknowledge the action. The individual has 3 duty days to submit a statement on his or her behalf before the AF
            IMT 1058 is finalized. Placement on the control roster is a mandatory UIF entry. The 6-month time period
            begins the day the AF IMT 1058 is finalized and ends at 2400 hours 6 months later. For example, if placed on
            the roster 1 January, this action expires at 2400 on 30 June. An individual‘s time does not stop and start for
            periods of temporary duty, ordinary leave, or a change in immediate supervisor. The commander can remove an
            enlisted member early from the control roster using AF IMT 1058.
7.13. Administrative Counseling, Admonitions, and Reprimands.
      Commanders, supervisors, and other persons in authority can issue administrative counseling, admonitions, and
      reprimands. These actions are intended to improve, correct, and instruct subordinates who depart from standards of
      performance, conduct, bearing, and integrity, on or off duty, and whose actions degrade the individual and unit‘s
      mission. Written administrative counselings, admonitions, and reprimands are subject to the rules of access,
      protection, and disclosure outlined in the Privacy Act of 1974. The same rules apply to copies kept by supervisors and
      commanders and those filed in an individual‘s UIF or the unit‘s personnel information file. Raters must consider
      making comments on performance reports when the ratee receives any of these adverse actions.
      7.13.1. Letter of Counseling (LOC) and Record of Individual Counseling (RIC).
            Counseling helps people develop good judgment, assume responsibility, and face and solve their problems.
            Counselors help subordinates develop skills, attitudes, and behaviors consistent with maintaining the Air Force
            readiness. First-line supervisors, first sergeants, and commanders routinely counsel individuals verbally or in
            writing, giving advice and reassuring subordinates about specific situations. The AF IMT 174, Record of
            Individual Counseling, is used to record the counseling session. AF IMT 174 provides a record of positive or
            negative counseling and is useful for performance evaluations. Counseling sessions may also be documented on
            bond paper or letterhead. The commander may file negative or unfavorable records of individual counseling in
            the UIF.
      7.13.2. Letter of Admonishment (LOA).
            An admonishment is more severe than an LOC or RIC and is used to document an infraction serious enough to
            warrant the LOA. Do not use an LOA when an LOR is more appropriate.
138                                                                                   1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
      7.13.3. Letter of Reprimand (LOR).
            A reprimand is more severe than an LOC or LOA and indicates a stronger degree of official censure.
            Commanders may elect to file an LOR in a UIF for enlisted personnel.
      7.13.4. Administering LOCs, RICs, LOAs, or LORs.
            Counselings, admonitions, or reprimands are administered either verbally or in writing. If written, the letter
            states:
            7.13.4.1. What the member did or failed to do, citing specific incidents and their dates.
            7.13.4.2. What improvement is expected.
            7.13.4.3. That further deviation may result in more severe action.
            7.13.4.4. That the individual has 3 duty days to submit rebuttal documents for consideration by the initiator.
            7.13.4.5. That all supporting documents received from the individual will become part of the record.
7.14. Administrative Demotion of Airmen.
      The group or equivalent-level commander may demote master sergeants and below. MAJCOM, FOA, and DRU
      commanders may demote senior master sergeants and chief master sergeants.
      7.14.1. Reasons for Demotion.
            Common reasons for the administrative demotion of Airmen include failure to:
            7.14.1.1. Complete officer transitional training for reasons of academic deficiency, self-elimination, or
            misconduct. Trainees will be demoted to the grade they formerly held.
            7.14.1.2. Maintain grade and skill relationship and skill level.
            7.14.1.3. Fulfill the responsibilities of a noncommissioned officer (NCO) as prescribed in AFI 36-2618, The
            Enlisted Force Structure.
            7.14.1.4. Attain or maintain fitness program standards as prescribed in AFI 36-2905, Fitness Program.
      7.14.2. Demotion Procedure.
            The commander must inform the Airman, in writing, of the intention to recommend demotion; cite the specific
            reason, demotion authority, and recommended grade for demotion; and provide a summary of the facts. The
            commander must advise the Airman that he or she may seek legal counsel and provide the name and number of
            the local area defense counsel (ADC) who can assist with written and oral statements. The commander must
            also inform the Airman of the right to apply for retirement (if eligible) in lieu of demotion and make sure the
            Airman endorses the demotion when he or she receives it. The Airman then has 3 duty days to agree or disagree
            with the action and to present written or oral statements. If, after reviewing the statements, the commander
            decides to continue the demotion process, he or she must notify the individual in writing. The commander then
            summarizes the Airman‘s statements and sends the entire case file to the servicing Military Personnel Element
            (MPE) for processing.
      7.14.3. Appeal Policy.
            Airmen may appeal a demotion decision. The appellate authority for Airmen in the grades of Airman through
            MSgt is the next level commander above the group commander. The appellate authority for Airmen in the
            grades of SMSgt and CMSgt is the Air Force Vice Chief of Staff, unless the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU
            commander delegated demotion authority to a subordinate level. If delegated, the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU
            commander then becomes the appellate authority for demotion appeals of SMSgts and CMSgts.
7.15. Administrative Separations:
      7.15.1. Military Service Obligation (MSO).
            Most first-term Airmen have an MSO requiring them to complete 8 years of military service. Airmen who have
            not met the MSO at the time of separation from active service could be released (not discharged) and transferred
            to the Air Force Reserve (AFR) to complete the balance of the MSO.
      7.15.2. Service Characterization.
            Airmen who do not qualify for reenlistment receive a discharge without regard to their remaining MSO. The
            character of the member‘s service is honorable. The service of members separating at their expiration of term of
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                          139

            service (ETS), or voluntarily or involuntarily separating for the convenience of the Government, is
            characterized as honorable. The service of members administratively discharged under AFI 36-3208,
            Administrative Separation of Airmen, may be characterized as honorable, under honorable conditions (general),
            or under other than honorable conditions. The service characterization depends upon the reason for the
            discharge and the member‘s military record in the current enlistment or period of service.
      7.15.3. Reasons for Separation.
            Airmen are entitled to separate at ETS unless there is a specific authority for retention or they consent to
            retention. Nevertheless, a separation is not automatic; members remain in the service until separation action is
            initiated. Many different reasons for separation exist. The following discussion cannot cover all of them; its
            purpose is to briefly identify major reasons for separation and a concise discussion of each:
            7.15.3.1. Required Separation:
            7.15.3.1.1. Airmen who will continue to serve in another military status must separate; for example, an Airman
            may separate to serve with the AFR or Air National Guard. An Airman may also separate to accept an
            appointment as a commissioned officer of the Air Force or to accept an appointment as a warrant or
            commissioned officer of another branch of service.
            7.15.3.1.2. Airmen with insufficient retainability for PCS must separate.
            7.15.3.2. Voluntary Separation. Airmen may ask for early separation for the convenience of the Government if
            they meet the criteria. Entering an officer training program, pregnancy, conscientious objection, hardship, and
            early release to attend school are some of the reasons for which members may be allowed to separate.
            7.15.3.3. Involuntary Separation. Physical conditions that interfere with duty performance or assignment
            availability, inability to cope with parental responsibilities or military duty, or insufficient retainability for
            required retraining are reasons for involuntary discharge for the convenience of the Government. Defective
            enlistment (fraudulent or erroneous) is also a basis for discharge. Airmen are subject to discharge for cause
            based on such factors as unsatisfactory performance, substance abuse, misconduct, or in the interest of national
            security.
            7.15.3.4. Discharge Instead of Trial by Court-Martial. If charges have been preferred against an Airman and
            if the UCMJ authorizes punitive discharge as punishment for the offense, the Airman may request an
            administrative discharge instead of trial by court-martial. There is no guarantee, however, that the Airman‘s
            request will be granted.
Section 7E—Punitive Actions
7.16. Military Law, a Separate Judicial System.
      Effective leadership is the most desirable means of maintaining standards. Military law provides commanders the
      tools, including court-martial and nonjudicial punishment (NJP), to deal with criminal conduct. The purpose of
      military law is to promote justice, to assist in maintaining good order and discipline in the Armed Forces, to promote
      efficiency and effectiveness in the military establishment, and to thereby strengthen the national security of the United
      States.
Figure 7.2. The Military Justice System Pillars.             7.16.1. The U.S. Constitution.
                                                             The U.S. Constitution is the primary source of our military law.
                                                             The framers of the U.S. Constitution gave Congress the
                                                             authority to make rules for the military, and Congress and the
                                                             President have used their combined authority to create the
                                                             military justice system currently in place (Figure 7.2). The U.S.
                                                             Constitution designates the President as Commander in Chief
                                                             (CINC) of the Armed Forces and vests the power to carry out
                                                             the responsibilities of this position. Congress has the power to
                                                             raise an Army and Navy, control the military budget, and make
                                                             rules for the government of the Army and Navy. This separation
                                                             of power is an important element of our military justice system.
140                                                                                    1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
      7.16.2. UCMJ and the MCM:
             7.16.2.1. UCMJ. In 1950, Congress enacted the UCMJ, and President Harry S. Truman signed it into law. The
             UCMJ became effective 31 May 1951.
             7.16.2.2. The MCM. In 1951, President Truman created the MCM by executive order. The MCM sets out rules
             for evidence, procedure, and maximum punishments. Furthermore, it also provides standardized forms. It is
             intended to provide military law guidance to commanders and judge advocates and is revised annually. The
             MCM contains a wide range of materials, including the U.S. Constitution, the UCMJ (including text and
             discussion of the punitive articles, as well as sample specifications), rules for courts-martial (RCM), and
             military rules of evidence (MRE).
      7.16.3. Legal Rights.
             Members of the Armed Forces retain virtually all the legal rights they held as civilians before entering the
             military, including protection against involuntary self-incrimination and the right to counsel.
             7.16.3.1. Self-incrimination:
             7.16.3.1.1. Involuntary Self-incrimination. The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution states that no person
             shall be compelled to be a witness against him or herself. Article 31, UCMJ, and MRE 304 reflect this right and
             prohibit involuntary statements from being used against an accused. A statement is ―involuntary‖ when
             obtained in violation of the Fifth Amendment, Article 31, or through the use of coercion, unlawful influence, or
             unlawful inducement. The UCMJ requires that prior to interrogation or any requests for a statement from a
             person suspected of an offense, the person must be first told of the nature of the accusation, advised that he or
             she does not have to make any statement regarding the offense, and that any statement he or she makes may be
             used as evidence against him or her in a trial by court-martial. Prior to interrogation, the suspect is entitled to
             consult with counsel and to have such counsel present at the interrogation. If counsel is requested, questioning
             must cease until counsel is present.
             7.16.3.1.2. Statements. Once properly advised of his or her rights, a person may waive these rights and choose
             to make a statement. Assuming this waiver is made freely, knowingly, and intelligently, any subsequent
             statement can be used as evidence in a court-martial or other judicial or administrative proceedings.
             7.16.3.2. Right to Counsel:
             7.16.3.2.1. The UCMJ provides an accused the right to be represented by a military attorney free of charge at
             general and special courts-martial regardless of the ability to pay. In the Air Force, an attorney is provided, free
             of charge, to represent all accused before summary, special, and general courts-martial; Article 32
             investigations; and in the Article 15 process.
             7.16.3.2.2. Military members accused of a crime will normally receive assistance and representation from the
             ADC. The ADC does not report to anyone at base level, including the wing commander or the base staff judge
             advocate (SJA). The ADC works for a separate chain of command and is responsible only to senior defense
             attorneys. This ensures undivided loyalty to the client. A military member may retain civilian counsel at no
             expense to the Government. The military member may also request an individual military defense counsel for
             representation at an Article 32 hearing or court-martial but does not have an automatic right to such
             representation. The requested counsel will represent the member if he or she is reasonably available.
7.17. Military Jurisdiction in Action:
      7.17.1. Apprehension and Pretrial Restraint:
             7.17.1.1. Apprehension. Apprehension is the act of taking a person into custody. It is the equivalent of a
             civilian ―arrest.‖ All commissioned officers, warrant officers, petty officers, NCOs, military and security forces,
             and persons on guard or performing police duties have the authority to apprehend persons subject to trial by
             court-martial. Apprehension requires probable cause, which means there are reasonable grounds to believe that
             the individual committed or is committing an offense.
             7.17.1.1.1. An apprehension is made by clearly notifying the person orally or in writing that he or she is in
             custody. The simple statement, ―You are under apprehension,‖ is usually sufficient to provide notice. During
             apprehension, such force and means as are reasonably necessary under the circumstances to effect the
             apprehension are authorized.
             7.17.1.1.2. NCOs not otherwise performing law enforcement duties may apprehend commissioned or warrant
             officers only on specific orders from a commissioned officer or when such apprehension prevents disgrace to
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                            141

            the service or to prevent the commission of a serious offense or escape of someone who has committed a
            serious offense. The immediate commander of an apprehended person should be promptly notified.
            7.17.1.2. Pretrial Restraint. Pretrial restraint is moral or physical restraint on a person‘s liberty that is imposed
            before and during the disposition of offenses. Pretrial restraint may include conditions on liberty, restrictions,
            arrest, or confinement. Only an officer‘s commander can order pretrial restraint of an officer; this authority
            cannot be delegated. Any commissioned officer may order pretrial restraint of any enlisted person. An enlisted
            person‘s commander may also delegate such restraint authority to an NCO.
            7.17.1.2.1. Conditions on Liberty. Conditions on liberty are imposed directing a person to do or refrain from
            doing specified acts; examples include orders to report periodically to a specified official, orders to stay away
            from a certain place (such as the scene of the alleged offense), and orders not to associate with specified persons
            (such as the alleged victim or potential witnesses). However, conditions on liberty must not hinder pretrial
            preparation.
            7.17.1.2.2. Restrictions in Lieu of Arrest. Restriction imposes restraint on a person to remain within specified
            limits, but is less severe than arrest. The geographic limits are usually broader (for example, restriction to the
            limits of the installation), and the offender will perform full military duties unless otherwise directed.
            7.17.1.2.3. Arrest. In the Armed Forces, the term ―arrest‖ means the limiting of a person‘s liberty. Arrest is not
            imposed as punishment for an offense. The notification of arrest directs a person to remain within specified
            limits. Arrest is a moral restraint; no physical restraint is exercised to prevent a person from breaking arrest. A
            person in arrest is not expected to perform full military duties.
            7.17.1.2.4. Confinement. Confinement is physical restraint, such as imprisonment in a confinement facility.
            Individuals are put in pretrial confinement only when lesser forms of pretrial restraint are inadequate. When a
            person is ordered into confinement they have the right to retain civilian counsel (at their own expense) or to
            request military counsel be assigned (at no expense to the accused). They also have the right to a prompt review
            of their status.
            7.17.1.3. Use of Pretrial Restraint. Pretrial restraint may only be ordered if there is a reasonable belief that the
            person committed an offense triable by court-martial and the circumstances require restraint. Factors to consider
            in ordering pretrial restraint include whether one can foresee that the person will not appear at trial or will
            engage in serious criminal misconduct while awaiting court-martial. Pretrial restraint should not be more
            rigorous than the circumstances require.
      7.17.2. Search and Seizure:
            7.17.2.1. The fourth amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.
            The authorization to search must be based on probable cause and particularly describe the place to be searched
            and the persons or things to be seized.
            7.17.2.2. Probable cause to search exists when there is a reasonable belief that the person, property, or evidence
            sought is located in the place or on the person to be searched.
            7.17.2.3. ―Authorization to search‖ is the military equivalent of a civilian search warrant. A search authorization
            is an express permission, written or oral, issued by a competent military authority to search a person or an area
            for specified property or evidence or to search for a specific person and to seize such property, evidence, or
            person.
            7.17.2.4. Commanders, as well as military judges, installation commanders, and magistrates, have the power to
            authorize a search and seizure over anyone subject to military law or at any place on the installation.
      7.17.3. Inspections.
            Commanders may conduct inspections of their units. Inspections are not searches. An inspection is an
            examination of the whole or part of a unit, organization, installation, vessel, aircraft, or vehicle conducted to
            determine the security, military fitness, or good order and discipline. The distinction between a search and an
            inspection is that an inspection is not conducted for the primary purpose of obtaining evidence for use in a trial
            or other disciplinary proceedings and does not focus on a particular suspect or individual. Contraband seized
            during an inspection (for example, vehicle entry checks, and random drug testing) is admissible in court.
7.18. Nonjudicial Punishment—Article 15.
      NJP is authorized under Article 15, UCMJ. Often referred to as an ―Article 15,‖ NJP provides commanders with an
      essential and prompt means of maintaining good order and discipline without the stigma of a court-martial conviction.
142                                                                                 1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
      An Article 15 may be imposed for minor offenses. Any Air Force member can be punished by Article 15.
      Commanders are encouraged to take nonpunitive disciplinary actions, such as counseling and administrative
      reprimand, before resorting to Article 15. However, such measures are not required before an Article 15 can be
      offered. An Article 15 should not be offered unless the commander is prepared to proceed with court-martial charges
      because an Article 15 cannot be imposed upon a member who demands trial by court-martial.
      7.18.1. Minor Offense.
            Whether an offense is minor depends on several factors and is a matter left to the imposing commander‘s
            discretion. Besides the nature of the offense, the commander should also consider the offender‘s age, grade,
            duty assignments, record, experience, and the maximum sentence imposable for the offense if tried by a general
            court-martial. Ordinarily, a minor offense is an offense in which the maximum sentence imposable would not
            include a dishonorable discharge or confinement for more than 1 year if tried by a general court-martial.
      7.18.2. Punishments Under Article 15.
            The type and permissible extent of punishment are limited by both the imposing commander‘s grade and the
            offender‘s grade as reflected in Table 7.2. Punishments may include reduction in grade, forfeiture of pay,
            restrictions, extra duties, and/or correctional custody.
      7.18.3. Procedures:
            7.18.3.1. Commanders initiate Article 15 action and impose punishment based on reliable information. The
            commander should consult the SJA to help determine whether NJP is appropriate. The SJA advises and helps
            the commander evaluate the facts and determine what offense was committed. However, the commander makes
            the decision to impose punishment and the degree of punishment imposed.
            7.18.3.2. After the commander determines that NJP is appropriate, the SJA prepares an AF Form 3070A,
            Record of Nonjudicial Punishment Proceedings (AB thru TSgt); AF Form 3070B, Record of Nonjudicial
            Punishment Proceedings (MSgt thru CMSgt); or AF Form 3070C, Record of Nonjudicial Punishment
            Proceedings (Officer). The commander notifies the member that he or she is considering punishment under
            Article 15 by signing the AF Form 3070A/B/C and providing it to the member. The AF Form 3070A/B/C
            includes a statement of the alleged offenses, the member‘s rights, and the maximum punishment allowable.
            After receiving the AF Form 3070A/B/C, the member has a right to examine all statements and evidence
            available to the commander. In practice, the member or the ADC is provided copies of the evidence used to
            support the alleged offenses.
            7.18.3.3. Once offered NJP, a member must first decide whether to accept. The member has no less than 3 duty
            days (72 hours) to make the decision. Before making the decision, the member may consult with military
            defense counsel. A member‘s decision to accept the Article 15 is not an admission of guilt but is a choice of
            forum. The member may present matters orally, in writing, or both and may present witnesses. The member is
            not required to present any matters or make any statement and has the right to remain silent under Article 31(b),
            UCMJ.
            7.18.3.4. After carefully considering all matters submitted by the member and consulting with the SJA, the
            commander will indicate one of the following decisions and annotate the AF Form 3070A/B/C accordingly:
            7.18.3.4.1. The member did not commit the offenses alleged, and the proceedings are terminated.
            7.18.3.4.2. In light of matters in extenuation and mitigation, NJP is not appropriate, and the proceedings are
            terminated.
            7.18.3.4.3. The member committed one or more of the offenses alleged. (The commander must line out and
            initial any offenses he or she determines were not committed.)
            7.18.3.4.4. The member committed one or more lesser-included offenses rather than the offenses listed.
            7.18.3.5. If the commander finds the member committed an offense, he or she will determine the appropriate
            punishment and serve it on the member, notifying the member of the right to appeal.
            7.18.3.6. Offenders have the right to appeal the decision to the next superior authority in the chain of command.
            The offender has 5 calendar days to submit a written appeal—an oral statement is not acceptable. Generally, the
            punishment is not put on hold pending a decision on the appeal.

  Notes:
  1. See MCM, part V, paragraph 5d, for further limitations on combinations of punishments.
  2. CMSgt or SMSgt may be reduced one grade only by MAJCOM commanders, commanders of unified or specified
  commands, or commanders to whom promotion authority to theses grades has been delegated. See AFI 36-2502, Airman
  Promotion Program. 51-202, Nonjudicial Punishment, Table 3.1, note 2.
  3. Bread and water and diminished rations punishments are not authorized.
  4. Frocked commanders may exercise only that authority associated with their actual pay grade. No authority is conferred
  by the frocked grade.
      7.18.4. Suspension, Remission, Mitigation, and Set-Aside Actions.
            A commander has the power to suspend, remit, or mitigate punishment of an Article 15.
            7.18.4.1. Suspension. To suspend punishment is to postpone application of all or part of it for a specific
            probationary period with the understanding that it will be automatically remitted (cancelled) at the end of this
            period if the offender does not engage in further misconduct. The probationary period may not exceed 6
            months. Suspension may occur when the commander imposes the punishment or within 4 months of executing
            the punishment. The MCM and Air Force policy encourage the use of suspended sentences as a corrective tool
            for first-time offenders because it provides both an observation period and an incentive for good behavior.
            7.18.4.2. Remission. Remission is an action whereby any portion of the unexecuted punishment is cancelled,
            normally used as a reward for good behavior or when determined the punishment imposed was too severe for
            the particular offense.
            7.18.4.3. Mitigation. Mitigation is a reduction in either the quantity or quality of a punishment. Commanders
            may, at any time, mitigate any part or amount of the unexecuted portion of the punishment by changing it to a
            less severe form or reduce its quantity. For example, a reduction in grade can be mitigated to a forfeiture of pay.
            7.18.4.4. Set Aside. Setting aside is an action whereby the punishment, whether executed or unexecuted, is set
            aside and any property, privilege, or rights affected by the portion of the punishment set aside are restored.
            Commanders use this action only when they believe that under all the circumstances of the case the punishment
            has resulted in clear injustice.
7.19. Types of Courts-Martial:
      7.19.1. Summary Court-Martial (SCM).
            A SCM tries minor offenses. Instead of a military judge, an active duty commissioned officer is appointed as
            the SCM officer. The accused may have assistance from the ADC. The SCM considers the evidence, including
            witness testimony, then makes a finding. If the finding is guilty, the SCM considers any additional evidence
            before deciding an appropriate sentence. Only enlisted service members may be tried by SCM and only if they
            consent to being tried in that forum. Sentences are limited as set out in Table 7.3, Line 1, Column F.
144                                                                                    1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
      7.19.2. Special Court-Martial (SPCM).
             Any service member may be tried by an SPCM. An SPCM is the intermediate-level court in the military system.
             The SPCM usually consists of a military judge and a panel (similar to a civilian jury) of three or more members.
             Enlisted accused may request at least one-third of the panel consist of enlisted members. The accused may
             request trial by military judge alone. The proceedings include a trial counsel (prosecutor), defense counsel, the
             accused, and a court reporter to record the proceedings. A sentence in an SPCM may include any punishment
             authorized by the UCMJ except death, dishonorable discharge, dismissal (in the case of an officer), or
             confinement in excess of 1 year.
      7.19.3. General Court-Martial (GCM).
             A GCM tries the most serious offenses. Cases cannot be referred for trial by GCM without a thorough and
             impartial investigation under Article 32, UCMJ. The GCM is composed of a military judge and at least a five-
             member panel, and may include at least one-third enlisted members, if so requested by an enlisted accused. The
             accused may request trial by a military judge alone, except in a capital case (when a sentence to death may be
             adjudged). The maximum authorized punishment this court-martial may impose is the maximum allowable
             under the UCMJ for the offenses charged. For some offenses, the maximum allowable sentence may include
             death.
7.20. Court-Martial Procedures:
      7.20.1. Trial.
             When a case is referred to trial, the convening authority, generally the wing or numbered Air Force (NAF)
             commander, selects the court-martial panel. Panel members must be senior in grade to the accused and be the
             best qualified. Throughout the court-martial process, commanders and convening authorities are expressly
             forbidden to exercise any improper influence on the action of the court.
      7.20.2. Findings and Sentence.
             The verdict of a court-martial is called the ―findings.‖ An accused cannot be found guilty unless guilt is proved
             beyond a reasonable doubt. A finding of guilty does not require a unanimous agreement, but requires at least
             two-thirds of the members to vote for a finding of guilty. Voting is by secret written ballot. In the event of a not-
             guilty verdict (acquittal), the trial ends. If there is a finding of guilty, a pre-sentencing procedure follows
             immediately to help the court determine an appropriate sentence. A sentence of death requires a unanimous vote
             by a panel of twelve members, while a sentence of confinement in excess of 10 years requires the concurrence
             of three-fourths of panel members.

      7.20.3. Post-Trial.
             When the court reporter completes the record of trial, the military judge ensures it accurately reflects the
             proceedings. Before the convening authority approves, disapproves, or reduces all or part of the findings and
             sentence, the complete record must be submitted to the SJA for review.
7.21. Initial Review of Trial Records.
      The convening authority must act on every case. The convening authority can approve or disapprove any portion of
      the findings or sentence; mitigate the sentence to another form of punishment, as long as the punishment is less severe;
      suspend the execution of any sentence that has been approved, except the death sentence; order a rehearing of the case;
      and defer (or postpone) forfeiture of pay and allowances, reduction in grade, or the service of a sentence to
      confinement.
7.22. Appellate Review:
      7.22.1. The Judge Advocate General (TJAG).
             Following the court-martial, the record of the trial is reviewed for legal sufficiency. TJAG reviews any case not
             automatically reviewed by the U.S. Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals.

      7.22.2. The U.S. Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals (AFCCA).
            The AFCCA is the first level of formal appellate review. The court may approve, disapprove, or modify the
            convening authority‘s findings and sentence. The court reviews records of trial that include a death sentence;
            dismissal of a commissioned officer; a punitive discharge; or confinement of 1 year or more.
      7.22.3. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (USCAAF).
            The USCAAF is composed of five civilian judges appointed by the President and is the highest appellate court
            in the military justice system. The court reviews all cases in which the death sentence was imposed and cases
            previously reviewed by the AFCCA forwarded on TJAG‘s order. The accused may also petition to have his or
            her case reviewed.
      7.22.4. The U.S. Supreme Court.
            Decisions of the USCAAF may be reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court.
7.23. NCO Military Justice Responsibilities.
      The military justice system is one tool used to correct breaches of discipline. NCOs have a general responsibility to be
      familiar with the UCMJ and correct marginal or substandard behavior or duty performance of their subordinates.
      NCOs must:
      7.23.1. Support their commander in the application of the military justice system for maintaining order and discipline.
      7.23.2. Become involved when breaches of discipline occur in their presence and report all such violations to the
      proper authorities.
      7.23.3. Be prepared to investigate incidents when ordered to do so. This means that NCOs should be familiar with both
      the right against self-incrimination and resources available to assist in conducting the investigation and should not
      hesitate to seek advice before acting.
      7.23.4. Be familiar with the rules in the UCMJ for apprehending, arresting, and confining violators of the UCMJ.
      7.23.5. Be prepared to generally counsel Airmen on their legal rights under the UCMJ and refer them to proper legal
      authorities for guidance.
      7.23.6. Provide leadership and counseling to obtain the maximum positive behavior change in the member receiving
      Article 15 punishment.

Section 7F—Legal Issues
7.24. Evolution of the Military Justice System:
      7.24.1. The strength of the military depends on disciplined service members ready to fight and win our Nation‘s wars.
      Military justice strengthens national security by providing commanders with an efficient and effective means of
      maintaining good order and discipline. Furthermore, the military justice system is a separate criminal justice system
      that does not look to the civilian courts to dispose of disciplinary problems. As a separate system, it allows the military
      to handle unique military crimes that civilian courts would be unable to handle.
      7.24.2. In addition, a separate system enables the military to address crimes committed by its members at worldwide
      locations in times of war or peace. The military needs a justice system that goes wherever the troops go to provide
      uniform treatment regardless of locale or circumstances. No other judicial system in the United States provides such
      expansive coverage. As our separate military justice system has evolved, it has balanced two basic interests: discipline
      (essential to war fighting capability) and justice (a fair and impartial system essential to the morale of those serving
      their country).
      7.24.3. While military justice can be traced to the time of the Roman armies, the historical foundation for the U.S.
      military law and criminal justice system is the British Articles of War. In fact, the first codes predated the U.S.
      Constitution and Declaration of Independence. These codes were the Articles of War, applicable to the Army, and the
      Articles for the Government of the Navy. Through World War I, these codes went through some amendments and
      revisions but were substantially unchanged for more than 100 years. Throughout most of this time, the United States
      had a very small standing military. Those who entered the military understood they were going to fall under a different
      system of justice with unique procedures and punishments. While some people had bad experiences with the military
      justice system as it existed at this time, there was no overwhelming demand for change.
      7.24.4. This changed with World War II (WWII) when the United States had over 16 million men and women serving
      in the U.S. Armed Forces. Incredibly, there were about 2 million courts-martial during hostilities. There were
      approximately 80,000 general courts-martial during WWII. An average of more than 60 general courts-martial
      convictions occurred per day for the duration of the war.
      7.24.5. The soldiers and sailors of WWII were regular citizens who volunteered or were drafted. Many of these
      citizens had some very unpleasant experiences with the military justice system, which looked quite different than it
      does today. The military justice system did not offer members the protections afforded by the civilian court system,
      and many American citizens disapproved of the way criminal laws were being applied in the military. Following the
      war, many organizations studied and made proposals to improve the military criminal legal system, and Congress
      conducted hearings on the military justice system.
      7.24.6. After unification of the Armed Services under the DoD in 1947, Secretary James V. Forrestal, the first
      Secretary of Defense, decided there should not be separate criminal law rules for the different branches of Service. He
      desired a uniform code that would apply to all services and address the abuses from WWII. His efforts set the stage for
      a new uniform system of discipline. In 1950, Congress enacted the UCMJ; this legislation is contained in 10 USC
      Sections 801 through 946. The UCMJ is the military‘s criminal code applicable to all branches of service.
      7.24.7. The UCMJ became effective in 1951 and provided substantial procedural guarantees of an open and fair
      process that continues today. The UCMJ required attorneys to represent the accused and the Government in all general
      courts-martial, prohibited improper command influence, and created the appellate court system. Furthermore, the
      UCMJ established Air Force, Army, Navy, and Coast Guard Boards of Review as the first level of appeal in the
      military justice system and the U.S. Court of Military Appeals as the second level of appeal. The Court of Military
      Appeals, composed of five civilian judges, was perhaps the most revolutionary change because it brought the checks
      and balances of civilian control of the U.S. Armed Forces into the military justice system. In October 1994, the Court
      of Military Appeals was renamed the USCAAF to bring the name more in line with its civilian counterparts.
      7.24.8. In addition to changing courts-martial processes and procedures, the UCMJ provided a complete set of criminal
      laws. Moreover, it included many crimes punished under civilian law (for example, murder, rape, drug use, larceny,
      drunk driving, etc.), and it also punished other conduct that affects good order and discipline. These unique military
      crimes include such offenses as desertion, absence without leave, disrespect toward superiors, failure to obey orders,
      dereliction of duty, wrongful disposition of military property, drunk on duty, malingering, and conduct unbecoming an
      officer. The UCMJ also included provisions punishing misbehavior before the enemy, improper use of countersign,
      misbehavior of a sentinel, misconduct as a prisoner, aiding the enemy, spying, and espionage.
AFPAM36-2241        1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                           149

      7.24.9. The UCMJ has been amended on a number of occasions. For example, the Military Justice Act of 1968 created
      the position of military judge, authorized trial by military judge alone, required an attorney to act as defense counsel in
      all SPCMs when the authorized punishment included a bad conduct discharge, prohibited trial by SCM if the accused
      objected, and changed service boards of review to courts of review.
      7.24.10. The next significant change was the Military Justice Act of 1983, which streamlined pretrial and post-trial
      procedures. The act also provided for direct appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court from the Court of Military Appeals in
      appropriate cases, without the need to first pursue an appeal through the civilian appellate courts. The act also
      established a separate punitive article (112a) for drug offenses. Today‘s UCMJ reflects centuries of experience in
      criminal law and military justice and guarantees service members rights and privileges similar to and, in many cases,
      greater than those enjoyed by civilians.
7.25. Constitutional Underpinnings:
      Two provisions in the U.S. Constitution grant powers to the legislative and executive branches providing the legal
      foundation for our military justice system.
      7.25.1. Powers Granted to Congress.
             The U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 8, provides that Congress is empowered to declare war; raise and
             support armies; provide and maintain a navy; make rules for the government and regulation of the land and
             naval forces; provide for calling forth the militia; and organize, arm, and discipline the militias, and govern such
             part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States. Congress is also responsible for all laws
             deemed necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all other powers vested by
             the U.S. Constitution in the US Government. Congress has exercised its responsibilities over military justice by
             enacting the UCMJ.
      7.25.2. Authority Granted to the President.
             The U.S. Constitution, Article II, Section 2, provides that the President serves as CINC of the U.S. Armed
             Forces and of the militia of the states (National Guard) when called to federal service. By virtue of authority as
             CINC, the President has the power to issue executive orders to govern the U.S. Armed Forces as long as these
             orders do not conflict with any basic constitutional or statutory provisions. Article 36, UCMJ, specifically
             authorizes the President to prescribe the procedures, including rules of evidence, to be followed in courts-
             martial. In accordance with Article 36, UCMJ, President Harry S. Truman established the MCM in 1951 to
             implement the UCMJ. The MCM, like the UCMJ, has undergone a number of revisions.
7.26. Jurisdiction of Military Courts.
      Courts-martial jurisdiction is concerned with the question of personal jurisdiction (Is the accused a person subject to
      the UCMJ?) and subject-matter jurisdiction (Is the conduct prohibited by the UCMJ?). If the answer is ―yes‖ in both
      instances, then (and only then) does a court-martial have jurisdiction to decide the case.
      7.26.1. Personal Jurisdiction:
             7.26.1.1. Personal jurisdiction involves status, that is, the accused must possess the legal status of a service
             member or a person otherwise subject to the UCMJ before personal jurisdiction can attach.
             7.26.1.2. Article 2, UCMJ, includes the following as persons subject to court-martial jurisdiction: (1) members
             of a regular component of the Armed Forces, including those awaiting discharge after expiration of their terms
             of enlistment; (2) cadets, aviation cadets, and midshipmen; (3) members of a Reserve component while on
             inactive duty training (but, in the case of members of the Army National Guard and Air National Guard, only
             when in Federal service); (4) retired members of a Regular component of the Armed Forces who are entitled to
             pay; (5) persons in custody of the Armed Forces serving a sentence imposed by court-martial; (6) prisoners of
             war (POW) in custody of the Armed Forces; and (7) in time of declared war or a contingency operation, persons
             serving with or accompanying an armed force in the field.
             7.26.1.3. While the UCMJ previously provided for jurisdiction over civilians serving with or accompanying an
             armed force in the field in time of war, the USCAAF held that the phrase ―in time of war‖ meant a war formally
             declared by Congress. The USCAAF decided this issue in reviewing a case (US v. Averette, 1970) in which a
             civilian had been tried during the Vietnam Conflict for crimes committed within the combat zone. In the
             National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007, Congress amended Article 2(a)(10) to provide for
             UCMJ jurisdiction over civilians serving with or accompanying an armed force in the field in time of declared
             war or a contingency operation.
150                                                                                   1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
      7.26.2. Subject-Matter Jurisdiction:
            7.26.2.1. Courts-martial have the power to try any offense under the code except when prohibited from doing so
            by the U.S. Constitution. Courts-martial have exclusive jurisdiction when a purely military offense such as
            desertion, failure to obey orders, or disrespect toward superiors is involved. However, if the offense violates
            both the UCMJ and a civilian code, concurrent jurisdiction may exist. For example, if an active duty military
            member is caught shoplifting at an off-base merchant, the member can be tried by court-martial for larceny in
            violation of Article 121, UCMJ, and tried by a civilian court for a larceny offense recognized in the local
            jurisdiction.
            7.26.2.2. The determination as to whether a military or a civilian authority will try the member is normally
            made through consultation or prior agreement between appropriate military authorities (ordinarily the SJA) and
            appropriate civilian authorities. While it is constitutionally permissible for a member to be tried by both a court-
            martial and a state court for the same act, a member who has been tried by a state court normally will not be
            tried by court-martial for the same act. Only the SECAF may approve such prosecutions, and only in the most
            unusual cases, when the ends of justice and discipline can be met in no other way.
7.27. Commander Involvement:
      7.27.1. Military commanders are responsible for maintaining law and order in the communities over which they have
      authority and for maintaining the discipline of the fighting force. Reports of crimes may come from law enforcement
      or criminal investigative agencies, as well as reports from supervisors or individual service members. One of the
      commander‘s greatest powers in the administration of military justice is the exercise of discretion—to decide how
      misconduct committed by a member of his or her command will be resolved. Each commander in the chain of
      command has independent, yet overlapping, discretion to dispose of offenses within the limits of that officer‘s
      authority. A commander may dispose of the case by taking no action, initiating administrative action against the
      member, offering the member NJP under Article 15, UCMJ, or preferring court-martial charges. Ordinarily, the
      immediate commander determines how to dispose of an offense; however, a superior commander may withhold that
      authority. The SJA is available to advise, but the commander ultimately decides how to dispose of alleged misconduct.
      7.27.2. If a commander believes preferred charges should be disposed by court-martial, the charges are forwarded to
      the convening authority. Convening authorities are superior commanders or officials who possess the authority to
      convene specific levels of courts-martial (wing and NAF commanders in most cases). A convening authority convenes
      a court-martial by issuing an order that charges previously preferred against an accused will be tried by a specified
      court-martial. The convening authority must personally make the decision to refer a case to trial; delegation of this
      authority is not allowed. Charges may be referred to one of three types of court-martial: summary, special, or general.
7.28. Roles of the Parties in the Adversarial System:
      In courts-martial, both Government and the accused have legal counsel. In addition, detailed defense counsel must
      include judge advocates, graduates of an accredited law school, and members of the bar of a federal court or the
      highest court of a state. Moreover, counsel must have certification to perform duties by a service‘s Judge Advocate
      General. The trial counsel prosecutes in the name of the United States and presents evidence against the accused. The
      defense counsel represents the accused and zealously seeks to protect the accused‘s rights.
      7.28.1. Trial Counsel:
            7.28.1.1. Trial counsel are similar to prosecutors in civilian criminal trials. They represent the Government, and
            their objective is justice, not merely securing a conviction. They zealously present evidence they believe is
            admissible and seek to persuade the court that the accused committed the alleged offenses. Trial counsel argues
            the inferences most strongly supporting the charges. Highly experienced trial advocates (senior trial counsel)
            are available to assist in the prosecution of particularly complex courts-martial.
            7.28.1.2. Trial counsel also presents evidence and arguments to address defenses raised on behalf of the
            accused. Trial counsel may not ethically permit the continuance of the cause of action against the accused
            knowing the charges are not supported by probable cause. Additionally, trial counsel have an affirmed duty to
            disclose to the defense any evidence that negates the accused‘s guilt, mitigates the degree of guilt, or reasonably
            tends to reduce the punishment of the accused.
            7.28.1.3. No person who has acted as accuser (one who prefers charges), investigating officer, military judge, or
            court member in any case may act later as trial counsel or assistant trial counsel in the same case. No person
            who has acted for the prosecution may act later in the same case for the defense, nor may any person who has
            acted for the defense act later in the same case for the prosecution.
AFPAM36-2241    1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                         151

    7.28.2. Defense Counsel Representation:
         7.28.2.1. In a trial by court-martial, the accused is entitled to military counsel free of charge. The accused may
         also hire a civilian lawyer at his or her own expense. An accused may request representation by a particular
         military lawyer, and this officer will serve if he or she is reasonably available. Defense counsel will zealously,
         within the bounds of the law, guard the interests of the accused.
         7.28.2.2. The ADC program, established in 1974, made the Air Force the first service to create a totally
         independent defense function. ADCs are assigned to the Air Force Judiciary, which falls under the Air Force
         Legal Operations Agency in Joint Base Andrews Naval Facility Washington. Although located at most major
         bases, the ADC works for a separate chain of command and reports only to senior defense attorneys. The ADC
         does not report to anyone at base level, including the wing commander and the base SJA. This separate chain of
         command ensures undivided loyalty to the client.
         7.28.2.3. ADCs work to protect a client‘s individual interests and ensure the independent and zealous
         representation of a client facing military justice action or other adverse actions, thereby promoting discipline
         and strengthening confidence in justice. Most ADCs are selected from the local base legal office, but to ensure
         further independence, they are not rotated back to the base legal office when their ADC assignments are
         completed.
         7.28.2.4. Before selection as an ADC, a judge advocate will be carefully screened for the proper level of
         judgment, advocacy skills, and courtroom experience. Additionally, other experienced trial advocates (senior
         defense counsel) travel to assist in the defense of particularly complex courts-martial. ADCs are supported by
         defense paralegals, who are enlisted personnel.
    7.28.3. Military Judge:
         A military trial judge presides over each open session of the court-martial. Military trial judges are selected
         from highly qualified, experienced judge advocates. Like defense counsel, military judges are assigned to the
         Air Force Legal Operations Agency and do not report to anyone at base level. No person is eligible to act as
         military judge in a case if he or she was the accuser, is a witness for the prosecution, or has acted as
         investigating officer or a counsel in the same case. The military judge of a court-martial may not consult with
         the members of the court except in the presence of the accused, trial counsel, and defense counsel, nor does he
         or she vote with the members of the court. In noncapital cases, an accused may elect to be tried by military
         judge alone. If such an election is made, the military judge will make a finding of guilty or not guilty and, if
         guilty, determine the sentence.
    7.28.4. Court Members:
         7.28.4.1. Members detailed to a court-martial are those persons who, in the opinion of the convening authority,
         are best qualified for the duty by reason of their age, education, training, experience, length of service, and
         judicial temperament.
         7.28.4.2. Court panels are normally only composed of officers senior to the accused. If the accused is enlisted
         and makes a timely request that enlisted members be included on the court, the panel must consist of at least
         one-third enlisted personnel.
         7.28.4.3. Court members determine whether the accused has been proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and,
         if guilty, adjudge (decide) a proper sentence based on the evidence and according to the instructions of the
         military judge. No member may use grade or position to influence another member. Voting is done by secret,
         written ballot.
    7.28.5. Ethical Standards:
         Both trial and defense counsels are bound by the ethical standards detailed in the Air Force Standards for
         Criminal Justice (available for review at the base legal office). These standards cover a variety of matters. For
         example, counsel may not:
         7.28.5.1. Present testimony known to be perjured or other evidence known to be false.
         7.28.5.2. Intentionally misrepresent any piece of evidence or matter of law.
         7.28.5.3. Unnecessarily delay or prolong the proceedings.
         7.28.5.4. Obstruct communications between prospective witnesses and counsel for the other side.
152                                                                                   1 OCTOBER 2013        AFPAM36-2241
            7.28.5.5. Use illegal means or condone the use of illegal means to obtain evidence.
            7.28.5.6. Inject his or her own personal opinions or beliefs into arguments to the court.
            7.28.5.7. Appeal to passion or prejudice.
            7.28.5.8. Attempt to influence court members by currying favor or communicating privately with them.
7.29. Post-trial Matters and Appellate Review:
      7.29.1. Post-trial Matters.
            The findings and sentence adjudged by a court-martial are not final until approved or disapproved by the
            convening authority. When taking action on a case, the convening authority must consider the results of trial,
            written recommendation of the SJA (required in all GCMs and all SPCMs that include a bad conduct
            discharge), and written matters submitted by the accused. Convening authorities may also consider the record of
            trial, personnel records of the accused, and other matters they deem appropriate.
            7.29.1.1. The convening authority may, but is not required to, act on the findings. If the convening authority
            acts on the findings, he or she has discretion to set aside any finding of guilty and either dismiss any or all
            charges and specifications against an accused or direct a rehearing on them. The convening authority may also
            reduce a finding of guilty to a charged offense to guilty of a lesser-included offense.
            7.29.1.2. As to the sentence, the convening authority may: (1) approve the sentence without change, (2)
            disapprove the sentence in whole or in part, (3) mitigate or suspend all or part of the sentence, or (4) change a
            punishment to one of a different nature as long as the severity of the punishment is not increased. The
            convening authority approves the sentence warranted by the circumstances of the offense and appropriate for
            the accused.
      7.29.2. Appellate Review.
            Following the convening authority‘s action is appellate review. The type of appellate review depends upon the
            adjudged and approved sentence.
            7.29.2.1. TJAG is the review authority in GCM cases where the sentence does not include death, dismissal,
            punitive discharge, or confinement for 1 year or more. TJAG may also elect to certify (refer) any case reviewed
            by TJAG‘s office to the AFCCA. The AFCCA is an independent appellate judicial body authorized by
            Congress and established by TJAG pursuant to direction of Title 10, USC, Section 866(a) (1994). The court
            hears and decides appeals of Air Force court-martial convictions and appeals during litigation. The AFCCA
            appellate judges are judge advocates appointed by TJAG.
            7.29.2.2. Unless appellate review is waived by an appellant, the AFCCA automatically reviews all cases
            involving a sentence that includes death, dismissal, a punitive discharge, or confinement of 1 year or more.
            However, appellate review cannot be waived in death penalty cases. In this forum, the appellant is provided a
            military counsel (free of charge) who is an experienced trial advocate and a full-time appellate counsel. Civilian
            appellate counsel may be retained at the appellant‘s own expense. The Government is represented by appellate
            Government counsel.
            7.29.2.3. The AFCCA must consist of a panel of at least three military judges, reviews the case for legal error,
            and determines if the record of trial supports both the findings and sentence as approved by the convening
            authority. The AFCCA has the power to dismiss the case, change a finding of guilty to one of not guilty or
            guilty to a lesser-included offense, reduce the sentence, or order a rehearing. However, it may not change a
            finding of not guilty to one of guilty. The TJAG instructs convening authorities to take action according to the
            court‘s decisions.
            7.29.2.4. If the AFCCA rules against the appellant, he or she may request review by the USCAAF. The
            USCAAF must review all death penalty cases and any other case directed by the TJAG of each service. Review
            in other cases is discretionary upon petition of the appellant and upon good cause shown. Air Force appellate
            defense counsel are appointed to represent the appellant before the USCAAF. If an appellant‘s case is reviewed
            and relief is not granted by the USCAAF, the appellant may petition the Supreme Court of the United States for
            further review.
            7.29.2.5. The SECAF automatically reviews cases involving dismissal of an Air Force officer or cadet.
            Dismissal is a punishment that punitively separates officers from the service. The dismissal cannot be executed
            until the Secretary, or appointed designee, approves the sentence.
AFPAM36-2241        1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                          153

             7.29.2.6. If the sentence extends to death, the individual cannot be put to death until the President approves this
             part of the sentence. The President has clemency powers over all courts-martial cases and may commute, remit,
             or suspend any portion of the sentence. However, the President may not suspend the part of the sentence that
             provides for death.
7.30. Punitive Articles.
      This paragraph focuses on unique military offenses that do not have a counterpart in civilian law.
      7.30.1. Absence Offenses.
             For an armed force to be effective, it must have sufficient members present to carry out the mission. One way
             this can be accomplished is by deterring members from being absent without authority, whether the absences
             are permanent or temporary. The circumstances under which the absence occurs, as well as the intent of the
             accused, determines the severity of the offense. Absence offenses include desertion and being absent without
             official leave (AWOL).
             7.30.1.1. Desertion:
             7.30.1.1.1. Article 85, UCMJ, may occur under the following categories: (1) unauthorized absence with the
             intent to remain away permanently, (2) quitting the unit or place of duty to avoid hazardous duty or shirk
             important service, or (3) desertion by an officer before notice of acceptance of resignation. More severe
             punishment is authorized if the desertion is terminated by apprehension instead of a voluntary surrender or if the
             desertion occurs in wartime. Desertion may be charged as a capital offense (which authorizes the death penalty)
             during wartime.
             7.30.1.1.2. Absence with the specific intent to remain away permanently is the most commonly charged type of
             desertion. The unauthorized absence may be from the accused‘s place of duty, unit, or organization. The
             specific intent to remain away permanently may exist at the beginning of the absence or may be formed at any
             time during the absence. Thus, when a member leaves without permission, intending to return after a period of
             time, but later decides never to return, the member has committed the offense of desertion. However, proving
             intent is often difficult and may be shown by a number of factors, including the length of the absence, use of an
             alias, disposal of military identification and clothing items, concealment of military status, distance from duty
             station, and the assumption of a permanent-type civilian status or employment. The accused‘s voluntary return
             to military control is not a defense to desertion. The essential issue is whether the accused, at any time, formed
             the intent to remain away permanently.
             7.30.1.2. AWOL:
             7.30.1.2.1. Article 86, UCMJ, addresses other cases where the member is not at the place where he or she is
             required to be at a prescribed time. This includes failure to go to the appointed place of duty; going from the
             appointed place of duty; absence from unit, organization, or other place of duty; abandoning watch or guard;
             and absence with intent to avoid maneuvers or field exercises.
             7.30.1.2.2. Proving a failure to go to an appointed place of duty requires showing the accused actually knew he
             or she was required to be at the appointed place of duty at the prescribed time. The offense of going from the
             appointed place of duty requires proof the accused left his or her place of duty without proper authority, rather
             than failing to report in the first place. The accused must have reported for and begun the duty before leaving
             without proper authority.
             7.30.1.2.3. Absence from the unit, organization, or other place of duty is a common AWOL charge. The
             authorized maximum punishment for this offense varies with the duration of the absence.
             7.30.1.2.4. ―Inability to return from leave‖ is a defense if the accused encountered unforeseeable circumstances
             beyond his or her control. For example, if TSgt Jane Doe‘s authorized 10-day period of leave expired on
             1 December and she failed to report to her unit until 3 December, she would not be guilty of AWOL if she
             could establish she was at a distant city and had purchased an airline ticket on a flight that was cancelled due to
             a blizzard. Even though she has a defense, she is not excused from calling her unit and requesting an extension
             of leave. Inability would not be a defense where a military member took space-available transportation to
             Europe while on leave and then claimed he or she was unable to return on the date planned because he or she
             was unable to get space-available transportation back when he or she had hoped.
             7.30.1.2.5. Other absences include abandoning watch or guard and absence from the unit, organization, or place
             of duty with intent to avoid maneuvers or field exercises. In addition, Article 87, UCMJ, provides that missing a
             movement is an offense that applies when the member, through neglect or design, misses the movement of a
             ship, aircraft, or unit.

      7.30.2. False Official Statements.
            Article 107, UCMJ, covers both the making and signing of false official statements and official documents. An
            ―official‖ statement or document is any statement or document made in the line of duty. ―In the line of duty‖
            pertains to a matter within the jurisdiction of any U.S. department or agency. Furthermore, it must be proven
            that the accused knew the statement or document was false and had a specific intent to deceive. Examples
            include falsely identifying oneself to a base gate guard or falsely listing a person as one‘s dependent to gain
            base privileges. However, material gain is not an element of the offense.
      7.30.3. General Article.
            The General Article (Article 134) is designed to address unspecified offenses punishable because of their effect
            on the U.S. Armed Forces. Article 134 generally provides for those offenses not specifically mentioned
            elsewhere in the punitive articles of the UCMJ. A military member can be punished under Article 134 for any
            and all disorders and neglects that are prejudicial to good order and discipline in the Armed Forces, for conduct
            of a nature to bring discredit upon the Armed Forces, and for crimes and offenses not capital.
            7.30.3.1. Disorders and Neglects Prejudicial to Good Order and Discipline. Article 134, UCMJ, seeks to
            protect the internal operation of the U.S. Armed Forces. The issue is the effect of the accused‘s act on good
            order and discipline within the Armed Forces. The effect must be reasonably direct and tangible. Disorders and
            neglects prejudicial to good order and discipline include breach of custom of the service, fraternization,
            impersonating an officer, disorderly conduct, gambling with a subordinate, and incapacitating oneself for duty
            through prior indulgence in intoxicating liquors.
            7.30.3.2. Conduct of a Nature To Bring Discredit upon the Armed Forces. The concern here is the potential
            effect of the accused‘s act on the reputation of the U.S. Armed Forces (how the military is perceived by the
            civilian sector). The conduct must tend to bring the Service into disrepute or lower it in public esteem. Thus,
            violations of local civil law or foreign law may be punished if they bring discredit upon the Armed Forces, such
            as dishonorable failure to pay debts, indecent exposure, fleeing the scene of an accident, bigamy, adultery, or
            pandering.
            7.30.3.3. Crimes and Offenses Not Capital. Acts or omissions not chargeable under other articles of the
            UCMJ, but are crimes or offenses under federal statutes, are charged under Article 134; for example,
            counterfeiting. This crime is not specifically listed in the UCMJ but is still a violation of federal law. Also, if a
            military member commits an act in an area over which the military exercises exclusive or concurrent
            jurisdiction with the state and no UCMJ article or federal law prohibits the act—only the law of the state
            prohibits the act—then the Federal Assimilative Crimes Act allows the member to be tried by a court-martial
            under Article 134.
      7.30.4. Offenses Related to War.
            The UCMJ includes a number of offenses related to war. These offenses include misbehaving before the enemy,
            aiding the enemy, compelling surrender, improperly using countersigns, mishandling captured or abandoned
            property, committing misconduct as a POW, and making disloyal statements. Two especially egregious offenses
            related to war are misbehavior before the enemy and misconduct as a POW.
            7.30.4.1. Misbehavior Before the Enemy. Article 99, UCMJ, provides that running away before the enemy
            and cowardly conduct are capital offenses punishable by death.
            7.30.4.1.1. The term ―enemy‖ (as used in ―running away before the enemy‖) includes both civilian and military
            organized forces of the enemy in time of war and any opposing hostile bodies including rebellious mobs or
            bands of renegades. The term is not restricted to the enemy Government or its Armed Forces. If the misbehavior
            were caused by fear, the offense is charged as ―cowardly conduct,‖ rather than ―running away.‖ Whether a
            person is ―before the enemy‖ is not a question of definite distance, but one of tactical relation.
            7.30.4.1.2. The critical element in the offense of cowardly conduct is fear that results in the abandonment or
            refusal to perform one‘s duty. Fear is a natural apprehension going into battle, and the mere display of
            apprehension does not constitute this offense. Cowardice is misbehavior motivated by fear. Genuine or extreme
            illness or other disability at the time of the alleged misbehavior may be a defense.
AFPAM36-2241     1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                           155

          7.30.4.2. Misconduct as a POW. Article 105, UCMJ, recognizes two types of offenses arising in POW
          situations. One offense involves unauthorized conduct by an accused who secures favorable treatment to the
          detriment of other prisoners. The other offense prohibits maltreatment of a POW by a person in a position of
          authority. The purpose of this article is to protect all persons held as prisoners, whether military or civilian and
          regardless of their nationality.
    7.30.5. Insubordination:
          7.30.5.1. Insubordinate conduct may be expressed in many different ways and toward many different persons in
          the military community. Insubordination is judged both by the means used and the relative relationship in the
          military hierarchy of the parties involved.
          7.30.5.2. Article 89, UCMJ, prohibits disrespectful acts or language used toward a superior commissioned
          officer in his or her capacity as an officer or as a private individual. Therefore, the superior commissioned
          officer does not need to be in the execution of his or her office at the time of the disrespectful behavior.
          However, it must be established that the accused knew the person against whom the acts or words were directed
          was the accused‘s superior commissioned officer. Disrespect may include neglecting the customary salute or
          showing a marked disdain, indifference, insolence, impertinence, undue familiarity, or other rudeness toward
          the superior officer. Truth is no defense. A superior commissioned officer is one who is superior in rank or
          command.
          7.30.5.3. Article 91, UCMJ, similarly prohibits insubordinate conduct toward a warrant officer, NCO, or petty
          officer. However, unlike Article 89 violations, the insubordinate conduct must occur while the individual being
          disrespected is in the execution of his or her duties. In addition, Article 91 does not require a superior-
          subordinate relationship as an element of the prescribed offense and can only be committed by enlisted
          members.
          7.30.5.4. Another form of insubordination involves striking or assaulting a superior officer. Article 90(1),
          UCMJ, prohibits assaults and batteries against superior commissioned officers in the execution of their duties.
          Article 91 prohibits similar conduct toward warrant officers, NCOs, and petty officers. ―In the execution of his
          office‖ includes any act or service the officer is required or authorized to do by statute, regulation, orders, or
          customs. An essential element is the accused‘s knowledge that the person is a superior officer or superior
          warrant officer, NCO, or petty officer. In time of war, striking a superior commissioned officer can be a capital
          offense.
    7.30.6. Disobedience Offenses:
          7.30.6.1. Disobeying a Superior Officer. Article 90(2), UCMJ, prohibits the intentional or willful disobedience
          of the lawful orders of a superior officer.
          7.30.6.2. Failure to Obey Orders or Regulations. Article 92, UCMJ, provides that members are subject to
          court-martial if they (1) violate or fail to obey any lawful general order or regulation; (2) having knowledge of a
          lawful order issued by a member of the Armed Forces, which is their duty to obey, fail to obey the order; or (3)
          are derelict in the performance of their duties.
          7.30.6.2.1. Lawful General Order or Regulation. This term relates to general orders or regulations that are
          properly published by the President, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of a military department, an officer
          having GCM jurisdiction, a general officer in command, or a commander superior to one of the former. (A
          squadron commander does not have the authority to issue general orders.) Once issued, a general order or
          regulation remains in effect even if a subsequent commander assumes command. Knowledge of the order is not
          an element of the offense, and a lack of knowledge is not a defense. Only those general orders or regulations
          that are ―punitive‖ are enforceable under Article 92(1). A punitive order or regulation specifically states a
          member may be punished under the UCMJ if violated. Regulations that only supply general guidelines or
          advice for conducting military functions are not ―punitive‖ and cannot be enforced under Article 92(1).
          7.30.6.2.2. Other Lawful Orders or Regulations. This offense includes violations of written regulations that
          are not general regulations. The key requirements are that the accused had a duty to obey the order and had
          actual knowledge of the order. Such knowledge is usually proven through circumstantial evidence. The accused
          cannot be convicted of this offense merely because he or she should have known about the order. Failure to
          obey a wing-level directive that prohibits overnight guests in the dormitory is an example.
          7.30.6.2.3. Dereliction of Duty. Dereliction of duty is comprised of three elements: (1) the accused had certain
          duties, (2) the accused knew or reasonably should have known of the duties, and (3) the accused was derelict in
          performing the duties, either by willfully failing to carry them out or by carrying them out in a negligent or
156                                                                                  1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
            culpably inefficient manner. ―Willfully‖ means performing an act knowingly and purposely while specifically
            intending the natural and probable consequences of the act. ―Negligently‖ means an act or omission of a person
            who is under a duty to use due care that exhibits a lack of this degree of care that a reasonably prudent person
            would have exercised under the same or similar circumstances. ―Culpable inefficiency‖ means an inefficiency
            for which there is no reasonable or just excuse. Merely being inept in the performance of duty will not support a
            charge of dereliction of duty, that is, officers or enlisted members cannot be punished for inadequate
            performance if they make a good faith effort but fall short because of a lack of aptitude or ability. Such
            performance may be grounds for administrative demotion or administrative discharge, but is not a crime.
      7.30.7. Lawfulness of Orders:
            7.30.7.1. A lawful order must be (1) reasonably in furtherance of or connected to military needs, (2) specific as
            to time and place and definite and certain in describing the thing or act to be done or omitted, and (3) not
            otherwise contrary to established law or regulation.
            7.30.7.2. An order is in furtherance of, or connected to, military needs when it involves activities reasonably
            necessary to accomplish a military mission or to safeguard or promote the morale, discipline, and usefulness of
            command. Such an order may interfere with private rights or personal affairs, provided a valid military purpose
            exists. Furthermore, the dictates of a person‘s conscience, religion, or personal philosophy cannot justify or
            excuse disobedience of an otherwise lawful order. An order requiring the performance of a military duty or act
            may be inferred to be lawful and is disobeyed at the peril of the subordinate. This inference does not apply to a
            patently illegal order, such as one that directs the commission of a crime. An accused cannot be punished for
            disobeying or failing to obey an unlawful order.
7.31. Conclusion:
      7.31.1. Air Force commanders must continuously evaluate force readiness and organizational efficiency and
      effectiveness. The inspection system provides the commander with a credible, independent assessment process to
      measure the capability of assigned forces. Inspectors benchmark best practices and exchange lessons learned and
      innovative methods.
      7.31.2. Criminal activity and intelligence operations against the Air Force threaten national security. When Air Force
      personnel commit criminal offenses, illegal activity occurs on an Air Force installation, or Air Force security is
      breached or compromised, the Air Force must thoroughly investigate criminal allegations and intelligence threats and
      refer them to appropriate authorities for action. This part of the chapter provided information on the Air Force
      Inspection System, the Inspector General Complaints Program, individual standards, and punitive actions. All four
      areas are necessary to enable the Air Force to fulfill our national security obligations efficiently and effectively.
      7.31.3. The mission of the United States Air Force is to defend the United States and protect its interests through air,
      space and cyberspace. Many aspects of carrying out this job involve legal issues. To prepare senior NCOs for greater
      responsibilities, this part of the chapter examined the evolution of our military justice system and its constitutional
      underpinnings, jurisdiction of military courts, commander‘s involvement in the process, roles of the parties in the
      adversarial system, post-trial matters and appellate review, and assorted punitive articles of the UCMJ.

                MILITARY CUSTOMS, COURTESIES, AND PROTOCOL FOR SPECIAL EVENTS

Section 8A—Overview
8.1. Introduction.
      Military customs and courtesies are proven traditions that explain what should and should not be done in many
      situations. They are acts of respect and courtesy when dealing with other people and have evolved as a result of the
      need for order, as well as the mutual respect and sense of fraternity that exists among military personnel. Military
      customs and courtesies go beyond basic politeness; they play an extremely important role in building morale, esprit de
      corps, discipline, and mission effectiveness. Customs and courtesies ensure proper respect for the military members
      and build the foundation for self-discipline. Customs and courtesies are outlined in four sections: Symbols,
      Professional Behavior, Drill and Ceremony, and Honor Guard. Not all-inclusive, this chapter highlights many of the
      customs and courtesies that make the Air Force and its people special.

Section 8B—Symbols
8.2. The United States Flag:
      The flag of the United States has not been created by rhetorical sentences in declarations of independence and
      in bills of rights. It has been created by the experience of a great people, and nothing is written upon it that has
      not been written by their life. It is the embodiment, not of a sentiment, but of a history.
                                                                         President Woodrow Wilson

      8.2.1. Laws of the United States Flag.
             The laws relating to the flag of the United States of America are outlined in detail in the United States Code
             (USC). Title 4, USC, Flag and Seal, Seat of Government, and the States, Chapter 1, pertains to the U.S. flag;
             Chapter 2 pertains to the seal; Chapter 3 pertains to the seat of the Government; and Chapter 4 pertains to the
             States; and Title 36, USC, Patriotic and National Observances, Ceremonies, and Organizations, Chapter 1,
             pertains to patriotic customs and observances. Executive orders and Presidential proclamations supplement
             these laws. See AFI 34-1201, Protocol, and AFPAM 34-1202, Guide to Protocol, for Air Force-specific
             guidance on protocol, decorum, customs and courtesies for Air Force ceremonies, conferences, and social
             events.
      8.2.2. Sizes, Types, and Occasions for Display.
             Sizes, types, and occasions for display of the flag of the United States are as follows:
             8.2.2.1. Installation Flag. This flag is lightweight nylon bunting material, 8 feet 11 3/8 inches by 17 feet and is
             only displayed in fair weather from an installation flagstaff. This is the typical flag used at Air Force
             installations.

            8.2.2.7. Interment Flag. This flag is 5 feet by 9 feet 6 inches of any approved material. The interment flag is
            authorized for deceased military personnel and for deceased veterans. This is the size flag used to drape over a
            closed casket. To receive a flag, fill out VA Form 27-2008, Application for United States Flag for Burial
            Purposes (available at http://www.cem.va.gov/cem/bbene/burial_flags.asp), and take it to any Veterans

            8.2.2.8. Retirement Flag. This flag may be either 3 feet by 4 feet or 3 feet by 5 feet. Members retiring from the
            Air Force are entitled to presentation of a United States flag. Base organization and maintenance (O&M) funds
            are authorized for this purchase. For details, refer to AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures.
            8.2.2.9. Automobile Flags. There are two sizes of this U.S. flag, each with specific uses.
            8.2.2.10. The 12- by 18-inch flag is trimmed on three sides with yellow fringe, 1 inch wide. This flag is
            displayed with the individual automobile flag of the President and Vice President of the United States.
            8.2.2.11. The 18- by 26-inch flag is trimmed on three sides with yellow fringe, 1 inch wide. This flag is
            displayed on government automobiles of individuals who are authorized positional colors.
      8.2.3. Time and Occasions for Display.
            The universal custom is to display the flag only from sunrise to sunset on buildings and on stationary flagstaffs
            in the open. However, when a patriotic effect is desired, the flag may be displayed 24 hours a day if properly
            illuminated during the hours of darkness. All flags should be illuminated when displayed with the flag of the
            United States.
            8.2.3.1. Air Force installations are authorized to fly one installation flag from reveille to retreat, normally on a
            flagstaff placed in front of the installation headquarters. Additional flagstaffs and flags are authorized adjacent
            to each dependent school on the installation. Written requests for exceptions to policy are sent to the appropriate
            major command (MAJCOM) vice commander for approval. The installation protocol office will maintain the
            approval memorandum.
            8.2.3.2. The flag should be hoisted briskly and lowered ceremoniously.
            8.2.3.3. The flag should not be displayed on days when the weather is inclement, except when an all-weather
            flag is used.
            8.2.3.4. The flag should be displayed on all days.
            8.2.3.5. The flag should be displayed during school days in or near every schoolhouse.
      8.2.4. Position and Manner of Display.
            The following rules will be observed:
            8.2.4.1. When carried in a procession with another flag or flags, the flag of the United States should be either on
            the marching right; that is, to the flag‘s own right (to the far right of all others) (Figure 8.1), or, if there is a line
            of other flags, in front of the center line. This also applies when flags are displayed in a stationary position.
            Flags carried by Airmen are never at halfstaff.
            8.2.4.2. The U.S. flag, when displayed with another flag against a wall from crossed staffs, should be on the
            right, the flag‘s own right (observer‘s left), and its staff should be in front of the staff of the other flag (Figure
            8.2).
            8.2.4.3. When the U.S. flag is displayed from a flagstaff with other flags, the following applies:
            8.2.4.3.1. When a number of flags are grouped and displayed from staffs radiating from a central point, and no
            foreign flags are in the display, the U.S. flag will be in the center and at the highest point of the group as shown
            in Figure 8.3.
            8.2.4.3.2. When a number of flags are displayed from staffs set in a line, all staffs will be of the same height and
            same finial. The U.S. flag will be at the right, which is to the left of an observer facing the display (Figure 8.4).
            However, if no foreign national flags are involved in the display, the U.S. flag may be placed at the center of the
            line if it is displayed at a higher level than the other flags in the display (Figure 8.5).

            8.2.4.3.3. When flags of two or more nations           Figure 8.5. United States Flag Displayed in a Line
            are displayed, they are flown from separate            with Other Flags at Lower Level.
            staffs of the same height. The flags should be of
            equal size. International usage prescribes the
            display of the flag of one nation equal to that of
            another nation in time of peace. The flags are
            displayed in a line, alphabetically, using the
            English alphabet, with the U.S. flag at its own
            right (the observer‘s left). When in North
            Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries,
            NATO member country flags are displayed in
            French alphabetical order.
            8.2.4.3.4. When the U.S. flag is displayed from a
            staff projecting horizontally or at an angle from
            the windowsill, balcony, or front of a building,
            the union (or blue field) of the flag should be
            placed at the peak of the staff (Figure 8.6).
            8.2.4.3.5. When displayed either horizontally
            or vertically against a wall, the union should
            be uppermost and to the flag‘s own right; that is, to the observer‘s left (Figure 8.7). When displayed in a
            window, the flag should be displayed in the same way, with the union to the left of observer in the street (Figure
            8.8).

Figure 8.8. United States Flag Positioned                8.2.4.3.6. When the flag is displayed over the middle of the street,
Horizontally on Wall or Window.                          it should be suspended vertically with the union to the north on an
                                                         east and west street or to the east on a north and south street.
                                                         8.2.4.3.7. When used on a speaker‘s platform, the flag, if displayed
                                                         flat, should be displayed above and behind the speaker (Figure 8.9).
                                                         When displayed from a staff in a church or public auditorium, the
                                                         U.S. flag should hold the position of superior prominence and in
                                                         the position of honor at the clergyman‘s or speaker‘s right as he or
                                                         she faces the audience. Any other flag so displayed should be
                                                         placed on the left of the clergyman or speaker or to the right of the
                                                         audience (Figure 8.10).

Speaker’s Platform.                                          Stage with Speaker.




            8.2.4.3.8. When the flag is suspended across a corridor or lobby in a building with only one main entrance, it
            should be suspended vertically with the union of the flag to the observer‘s left upon entering. If the building has
            more than one main entrance, the flag should be suspended vertically near the center of the corridor or lobby
            with the union to the north when entrances are to the east and west or to the east when entrances are to the north
            and south. This includes aircraft hangars.
            8.2.4.3.9. When three flag staffs are positioned outside a building, there may be two display options. If the flag
            staffs are in a straight line, then the flags should be of the same height with the U.S. flag to its own right. Use
            the building looking out to the flags as the point of reference for flag placement when flags are in line. If the
            flag is positioned on the center staff, then the center staff must be higher than the other two staffs.
            8.2.4.3.10. On a closed casket, place the flag lengthwise with the union at the head and over the left shoulder of
            the deceased (Figure 8.11). When a full-couch casket is opened, remove the flag, fold to the triangular shape of
            a cocked hat, and place in the lid at the head end of the casket and just above the decedent‘s left shoulder. When
            a half-couch casket is opened, fold the flag on the lower half of the casket in the same relative position as when
            displayed full length on a closed casket. Do not lower the flag into the grave, and do not allow it to touch the
            ground. The interment flag may be given to the next of kin at the conclusion of the interment.

            right when posted and also when used
            in official photographs. The blue field
            is on top with stripes running left to
            right.
            8.2.4.3.12. When painted or displayed
            on an aircraft or vehicle, the union is
            toward the front and the stripes trail.

      8.2.5. Respect for the United States Flag.
            No disrespect should be shown to the
            U.S. flag; the flag will not be dipped
            to any person or thing. Regimental colors, state flags, and organizational or institutional flags are always dipped
            as a mark of respect to the U.S. flag. However, the Air Force flag and organizational flags will be dipped as
            appropriate. Military members will render the military salute as appropriate. At no time will a foreign national
            flag be dipped.
            8.2.5.1. The flag should never be displayed with union down, except as a signal of dire distress in instances of
            extreme danger to life or property.
            8.2.5.2. The flag should never touch anything beneath it, such as the ground, the floor, water, or merchandise.
            The flag should never be used as the covering for a statue or monument, although it could form a distinctive
            feature in a ceremony of the unveiling of a statue or monument.
            8.2.5.3. The flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free.
            8.2.5.4. The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery. It should never be festooned,
            drawn back, up, or in folds, but always allowed to fall free (for example, the flag should not be used to cover a
            speaker‘s podium, drape the front of a platform, or for other decoration. A proper substitute is bunting of blue,
            white, and red, always arranged with the blue above, the white in the middle, and the red below).
            8.2.5.5. The flag should never be fastened, displayed, used, or stored in such a manner as to permit it to be
            easily torn, soiled, or damaged.
            8.2.5.6. The flag should never be used as a covering for a ceiling.
            8.2.5.7. The flag should never have placed upon it, nor on any part of it, nor attached to it any mark, insignia,
            letter, word, figure, design, picture, or drawing of any nature.
            8.2.5.8. The flag should never be used as a receptacle for receiving, holding, carrying, or delivering anything.
            8.2.5.9. The flag should never be used for advertising purposes. It should not be embroidered on such articles as
            cushions or handkerchiefs. It should not be printed or otherwise impressed on paper napkins or boxes or
            anything that is designed for temporary use and discard. Advertising signs should not be fastened to a staff or
            halyard from which the flag is flown.
            8.2.5.10. No part of the flag should be used as a costume or athletic uniform. However, a flag patch may be
            affixed to the uniform of military personnel, firemen, policemen, and members of patriotic organizations. A
            lapel flag pin, being a replica of the flag, should be worn on the left lapel near the heart. Patches worn on
            uniforms depicting the U.S. flag should be worn on the left shoulder, with the union to the viewer‘s left.
            8.2.5.11. The flag should not be displayed on a float in a parade except from a staff.
            8.2.5.12. The flag should not be draped over the hood, top, sides, or back of a vehicle, railroad train, or boat.
            When the flag is displayed on an automobile, the staff should be fixed firmly to the chassis or clamped to the
            right fender.
            8.2.5.13. No other flag or pennant should be placed above or, if on the same level, to the right (observer‘s left)
            of the U.S. flag, except during church services conducted by naval chaplains at sea when the church pennant
            may be flown above the flag during church services for the personnel of the Navy.

     8.2.6. Display of the U.S. Flag at Halfstaff.
            The U.S. flag is flown at halfstaff throughout the United States and its territories and possessions on all DoD
            buildings, grounds, and naval vessels on several days throughout the year according to DoDI 1005.06, Display
            of the National Flag at Half-Staff (Figures 8.12 and 8.13).

Figure 8.12. U.S. Flag at Full Staff.                                Figure 8.13. U.S. Flag at Halfstaff.




            8.2.6.1. The following days apply:
            8.2.6.1.1. On Memorial Day, fly the flag at halfstaff until noon, then raise to the top of the staff.
            8.2.6.1.2. On Peace Officers Memorial Day, 15 May, unless that day is also Armed Forces Day.
            8.2.6.1.3. On Patriot Day, 11 September.
            8.2.6.1.4. On National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, 7 December.
            8.2.6.1.5. Each year in honor of the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service according to Public Law
            107-51. This date is usually the first Sunday in October and is announced annually by Presidential
            Proclamation.
            8.2.6.1.6. On the death of individuals in accordance with AFI 34-1201.
            8.2.6.1.7. When so directed by the President of the United States or the Secretary of Defense.
            8.2.6.2. The responsible military commander ensures the procedures for flying the flag at halfstaff are executed
            as follows:
            8.2.6.2.1. The term ―halfstaff‖ means the position of the flag when the flag is one-half the distance between the
            top and bottom of the staff.
            8.2.6.2.2. When flown at halfstaff, first hoist the flag to the peak for an instant and then lower to the halfstaff
            position. Raise the flag again to the peak position before lowering it for the end of the day.
164                                                                                   1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
            8.2.6.3. The flag is flown at halfstaff outside the United States on DoD buildings, grounds, and naval vessels
            even if another nation‘s flag is flown full staff next to the U.S. flag.
            8.2.6.4. All flags displayed with the U.S. flag are flown at halfstaff when the U.S. flag is flown at halfstaff, with
            the exception of foreign national flags.
            8.2.6.5. The Heads of DoD components may direct that the flag be flown at halfstaff on buildings, grounds, or
            naval vessels under their jurisdiction on occasions when they consider it proper and appropriate. Within the Air
            Force, this authority is delegated to the installation commander. Any time an installation commander decides to
            fly the flag at halfstaff based on this local authority for a local death, state the reason on the base marquees to
            avoid confusion.
      8.2.7. Care and Disposition of United States Flags.
            Exercise extreme care to ensure proper handling and cleaning of soiled flags. Professionally mend a torn flag,
            but destroy a badly torn or tattered flag. Title 4, USC, Chapter 1, states: "The flag, when it is in such condition
            that it is no longer a fitting emblem for display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning."
            There may be instances when a flag is retired from service and preserved because of its historical significance.
            In this case, the unit must request disposition instructions from the proper authority, such as the installation
            honor guard or protocol office.
      8.2.8. How to Obtain a Flag Flown Over the Capitol.
            Constituents may arrange to purchase flags flown over the Capitol by getting in touch with their Senator or
            Representative. A certificate signed by the Architect of the Capitol accompanies each flag. Ordering
            procedures are outlined at the following Web site: http://www.capitolflags.gov/ordering.

            Force yellow (Figure 8.14). The 13 white
            stars represent the original 13 colonies. The
            Air Force yellow numerals under the shield
            stand for 1947, the year the Department of
            the Air Force was established. The band
            encircling the whole design is white edged
            in Air Force yellow with black lettering
            reading ―Department of the Air Force‖ on
            the top and ―United States of America‖ on
            the bottom. Centered on the circular
            background is the Air Force Coat of Arms,
            consisting of the crest and shield.
            8.3.1.1. The crest consists of the eagle,
            wreath, and cloud form. The American bald
            eagle symbolizes the United States and its
            air power, and appears in its natural colors. The wreath under the eagle is made up of six alternate folds of metal
            (white, representing silver) and light blue. This repeats the metal and color used in the shield. The white clouds
            behind the eagle denote the start of a new sky.
            8.3.1.2. The shield, directly below the eagle and wreath, is divided horizontally into two parts by a nebular line
            representing clouds. The top part bears an Air Force yellow thunderbolt with flames in natural color that shows
            striking power through the use of aerospace. The thunderbolt consists of an Air Force yellow vertical twist with
            three natural color flames on each end crossing a pair of horizontal wings with eight lightning bolts. The
            background of the top part is light blue representing the sky. The lower part is white representing metal silver.

      8.3.2. Authorized and Unauthorized Uses of the Seal and Coat of Arms.
             Title 18, USC, Section 506, Seals of Departments or Agencies, protects the Air Force seal from unauthorized
             use. Falsely making, forging, counterfeiting, mutilating, or altering the seal or knowingly using or possessing
             with fraudulent intent any such altered seal is punishable by law. AFMAN 33-326, Preparing Official
             Communications, describes the authorized uses of the seal or any part thereof. The Coat of Arms is authorized
             for commercial and unofficial use when approved by the Secretary of the Air Force, Public Affairs (SAF/PA).
             The Coat of Arms is a trademark and as such, must be protected against unauthorized use or alterations to
             approved versions. Approved versions of the Coat of Arms, guidelines for its use, and contact information to

8.4. Official Air Force Symbol:                                    Figure 8.15. Air Force Symbol.
      8.4.1. The Air Force Symbol (Figure 8.15) is the
      official symbol of the United States Air Force. It
      honors the heritage of our past and represents the
      promise of our future. Furthermore, it retains the
      core elements of our Air Corps heritage—the
      ―Arnold‖ wings and star with circle—and
      modernizes them to reflect our air and space force
      of today and tomorrow.
      8.4.2. The symbol has two main parts. In the upper
      half, the stylized wings represent the stripes of our
      strength—the enlisted men and women of our
      force. They are drawn with great angularity to
      emphasize our swiftness and power and are
      divided into six sections which represent our
      distinctive capabilities—air and space superiority,
      global attack, rapid global mobility, precision
      engagement, information superiority, and agile
      combat support.
      8.4.3. In the lower half are a sphere, a star, and
      three diamonds. The sphere within the star
      represents the globe. Moreover, it reminds us of our obligation to secure our Nation‘s freedom with global vigilance,
      reach, and power. The globe also reminds us of our challenge as an expeditionary force to respond rapidly to crises
      and to provide decisive air and space power worldwide.
      8.4.4. The area surrounding the sphere takes the shape of a star. The star has many meanings. The five points represent
      the components of our one force and family—our active duty, civilians, Guard, Reserve, and retirees. The star
      symbolizes space as the high ground of our nation‘s air and space force. The rallying symbol in all our wars, the star
      also represents our officer corps, central to our combat leadership.
      8.4.5. The star is framed with three diamonds that represent our core values—integrity first, service before self, and
      excellence in all we do. The elements come together to form one symbol that presents two powerful images—at once
      an eagle, the emblem of our Nation; and a medal, representing valor in service to our Nation.
      8.4.6. The Air Force Symbol is a registered trademark and as such, must be protected against unauthorized use or
      alterations to approved versions. Approved versions of the official Air Force Symbol and guidelines for its use are
      available online at http://www.trademark.af.mil. Online guidance includes information on federal and non-federal use,
      endorsements, definitions, components, calculating proportions, displaying, formats, specifications, file types, graphic
      types, colors logotype, and much more. While DoD employees and their immediate families have an implied license to
      use the Air Force Symbol on personal products such as printed materials, clothing, literature, briefings, coins, Web
      sites, and food, they should seek design approval in advance from the Air Force Trademark and Licensing Office.
      These personal items must be for internal use only and not for retail sales, advertising, or potential endorsements.
      Symbol usage must adhere to the posted guidelines. Anyone wishing to use the symbol for commercial purposes must
      first obtain a license agreement. Applications for agreements are available at http://www.trademark.af.mil.
Section 8C—Professional Behavior
8.5. Respect for the Flag.
      The procedures to use when showing respect to the flag and the national anthem include:
166                                                                                     1 OCTOBER 2013           AFPAM36-2241
      8.5.1. When outdoors, all personnel in uniform, except those in formation must face the flag and salute during the
      raising and lowering of the flag. Upon the first note of the national anthem or ―To the Colors,‖ all personnel in uniform
      who are not in formation will stand at attention, face the flag (or the sound of the music, if the flag is not visible), and
      salute. Hold the salute until the last note of the national anthem or ―To the Colors‖ is played.
       8.5.2. All vehicles in motion will pull to the side of the road and stop. All occupants sit quietly until the last note of
       the national anthem or ―To the Colors‖ has played.
       8.5.3. When in civilian clothes, face the flag (or the sound of the music if the flag is not visible) and stand at attention
       with the right hand placed over the heart or render a salute.
      8.5.4. If indoors during retreat or reveille, there is no need to stand or salute. However, everyone must stand during the
      playing of the national anthem before a showing of a movie while in the base theater. When listening to a radio or
      watching television, no specific action is necessary. Additionally, a folded flag is considered cased; therefore, a salute
      is not necessary.
8.6. Saluting.
      The salute is a courteous exchange of greetings, with the junior member always saluting the senior member first. A
      salute is also rendered to the flag as a sign of respect. Any Airman, noncommissioned officer (NCO), or officer
      recognizing a need to salute or a need to return a salute may do so anywhere at any time. When returning or rendering
      an individual salute, the head and eyes are turned toward the flag or person saluted. Guidance when exchanging salutes
      includes:
      8.6.1. Outdoors.
             Salutes are exchanged upon recognition between officers or warrant officers and enlisted members of the
             Armed Forces when they are in uniform. Saluting outdoors means salutes are exchanged when the persons
             involved are outside of a building. For example, if a person is on a porch, a covered sidewalk, a bus stop, a
             covered or open entryway, or a reviewing stand, the salute will be exchanged with a person on the sidewalk
             outside of the structure or with a person approaching or in the same structure. This applies both on and off
             military installations. The junior member should initiate the salute in time to allow the senior officer to return it.
             To prescribe an exact distance for all circumstances is not practical; however, good judgment should dictate
             when salutes are exchanged. Superiors carrying articles in both hands need not return the salute, but should nod
             in return or verbally acknowledge the salute. If the junior member is carrying articles in both hands, verbal
             greetings should be exchanged. Also, use the same procedures when greeting an officer of a foreign nation. Use
             these procedures in:
             8.6.1.1. Formation. Members do not salute or return a salute unless given the command to do so. The person in
             charge salutes and acknowledges salutes for the whole formation.
             8.6.1.2. Groups, But Not in Formation. When a senior officer approaches, the first individual noticing the
             officer calls the group to attention. All members face the officer and salute. If the officer addresses an individual
             or the group, all remain at attention (unless otherwise ordered) until the end of the conversation, at which time
             they salute the officer.
             8.6.1.3. Public Gatherings. Salutes between individuals are not required in public gatherings, such as sporting
             events, meetings, or when a salute would be inappropriate or impractical.
             8.6.1.4. Moving Military Vehicles. Exchange of salutes between military pedestrians (including gate sentries)
             and officers in moving military vehicles is not mandatory. However, when officer passengers are readily
             identifiable (for example, officers in appropriately marked staff vehicles), the salute must be rendered.
             8.6.1.5. The Presence of Civilians. Persons in uniform may salute civilians. The President of the United States,
             as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, is always accorded the honor of a salute. AFI 34-1201 provides
             additional guidance. In addition, if the exchange of salutes is otherwise appropriate, customs encourage
             military members in civilian clothes to exchange salutes upon recognition.
             8.6.1.6. A Work Detail. In a work detail, individual workers do not salute. The person in charge salutes for the
             entire detail.
             8.6.1.7. Military Funeral. When at a military funeral in uniform, salute the caisson or hearse as it passes and
             the casket as it is carried by your position. You also salute during the firing of volleys and the playing of
             ―Taps.‖
AFPAM36-2241        1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                         167

      8.6.2. Indoors.
             Except for formal reporting, salutes are not rendered.
8.7. Military Etiquette.
      Etiquette is defined as common, everyday courtesy. The military world, like the civilian world, functions more
      smoothly and pleasantly when members practice good manners.
      8.7.1. Simple things like saying ―please‖ and ―thank you‖ help the organization run smoother because people respond
      more enthusiastically when asked in a courteous manner to do something. They also appreciate knowing their efforts
      are recognized when told ―thank you.‖
      8.7.2. One of the most valuable habits anyone can develop is to be on time for appointments. Granted, sometimes a
      person cannot avoid being late. When this happens, the best course of action is to call ahead or to reschedule the
      appointment. Do not keep others waiting.
      8.7.3. Address civil service employees properly. As a rule, address them appropriately as ―Mr.,‖ ―Mrs.,‖ ―Miss,‖ or
      ―Ms.‖ and their last name, unless requested to do otherwise. Always address a superior formally. This is especially
      important in most foreign countries where using first names on the job is much more limited than in the United States.
      8.7.4. Don‘t gossip. A discussion of personal habits, problems, and activities (real or rumored) of others often results
      in quarrels and disputes among people who work together. The morale of any unit may suffer because of feuds that
      arise from gossip. The best policy is not to gossip and to discourage others from gossiping.
      8.7.5. Use proper telephone etiquette. Always be polite and identify yourself and your organization. When an
      individual is not available to take a call, ask: ―May I take a message?‖ or ―Is there something I may help you with?‖ If
      taking a message to return a call, write down the individual‘s name, organization, telephone number, the message, and
      then pass this information along to the intended recipient.
      8.7.6. Do not lean or sit on desks. Also, do not lean back in a chair or put feet on desks. This type of conduct doesn‘t
      present a professional military image.
      8.7.7. In general, use common sense, be considerate of other people, and insist your subordinates do the same.
8.8. Courtesies to Other Services:
      8.8.1. The collective efforts of the Air Force, Army, Navy, Marines, and Coast Guard provide for the defense of the
      country against aggression. All Services are part of the military team; therefore, extend the same military courtesies to
      members of the other Services. While there is a friendly natural rivalry between the Services, military courtesies
      among Services remain the same. Thus, the members of the other Services are as much comrades-in-arms as are any
      Airmen.
      8.8.2. This is equally true of the friendly armed forces of the United Nations. Salute all commissioned officers and pay
      the same respect to the national anthems and flags of other nations as rendered the United States national anthem and
      flag. While not necessary to learn the identifying insignia of the military grades of all nations, you should learn the
      insignia of the most frequently contacted nations, particularly during an overseas assignment or deployment.
8.9. Respect and Recognition:
      8.9.1. Common Acts of Courtesy.
             Common acts of courtesy among all Air Force personnel aid in maintaining discipline and promoting the
             smooth conduct of affairs in the military establishment. When courtesy falters within a unit, discipline ceases to
             function, and accomplishing the mission is endangered. Many of the Air Force courtesies involve the salute.
             There are, however, many other courtesies commonly extended to superiors, subordinates, and working
             associates. Some acts of courtesies include:
             8.9.1.1. Giving the senior person, enlisted or commissioned, the position of honor when walking, riding, or
             sitting with him or her at all times. The junior person takes the position to the senior‘s left.
             8.9.1.2. When reporting to an officer indoors, knock once and enter when told to do so. Upon entering, march to
             approximately two paces from the officer or desk, halt, salute, and report in this manner: ―Sir (Ma‘am), Airman
             Smith reports as ordered,‖ or ―Sir (Ma‘am), Airman Smith reports.‖ When the conversation is completed,
             execute a sharp salute and hold it until the officer acknowledges it, then perform the appropriate facing
             movements and depart.
168                                                                                    1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
            8.9.1.3. Unless told otherwise, rise and stand at attention when a senior official enters or departs a room. If more
            than one person is present, the person who first sees the officer calls the group to attention. However, if an
            officer is already in the room who is equal to or has a higher rank than the officer entering the room, do not call
            the room to attention.
            8.9.1.4. Military personnel enter automobiles and small boats in reverse order of rank. Juniors will enter a
            vehicle first and take their appropriate seat on the senior‘s left. The senior officer will be the last to enter the
            vehicle and the first to leave it.
      8.9.2. Terms of Address.
            For the proper terms of address, refer to Figure 8.16.

Section 8D—Drill and Ceremony
8.10. Flag Ceremonies:
      8.10.1. Reveille.
            The signal for the start of the official duty day is the reveille. Because the time for the start of the duty day
            varies between bases, the commander designates the specified time for reveille. If the commander desires, a
            reveille ceremony may accompany the raising of the flag. This ceremony takes place after sunrise near the base
            flagstaff. In the unit area, reveille is normally held using the formation of squadron in line. This formation is
            used when a reveille ceremony is not held at the base flagstaff. Procedures for reveille include:
            8.10.1.1. Shortly before the specified time, Airmen march to a predesignated position near the base flagstaff,
            halt, face toward the flagstaff, and dress. The flag security detail arrives at the flagstaff at this time and remains
            at attention.
            8.10.1.2. The unit commander (or senior participant) commands ―Parade, REST.‖
            8.10.1.3. At the specified time for reveille, the unit commander commands ―SOUND REVEILLE.‖ The flag
            detail assumes the position of attention, moves to the flagstaff, and attaches the flag to the halyards.
            8.10.1.4. After reveille is played, the unit commander commands ―Squadron, ATTENTION‖ and ―Present,
            ARMS‖ and then faces the flagstaff and executes present arms. On this signal, the national anthem or ―To the
            Colors‖ is sounded.
            8.10.1.5. On the first note of the national anthem or ―To the Colors,‖ the flag security detail begins to raise the
            flag briskly. The senior member of the detail holds the flag to keep it from touching the ground.
            8.10.1.6. The unit commander holds the salute until the last note of the national anthem or ―To the Colors‖ is
            played. Then he or she executes order arms, faces about, and commands ―Order, ARMS.‖ The Airmen then
            march back to the dismissal area.
      8.10.2. Raising the Flag:
            8.10.2.1. When practical, a detail consisting of one NCO and two Airmen hoists the flag. This detail should
            carry sidearms if the special equipment of the guard includes sidearms.
AFPAM36-2241    1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                           169

         8.10.2.2. The detail forms in line with the NCO carrying the flag in the center. The detail then marches to the
         flagstaff and halts, and the flag is attached to the halyards. The flag is always raised and lowered from the
         leeward side of the flagstaff. The two Airmen attend the halyards, taking a position facing the staff to hoist the
         flag without entangling the halyards.
         8.10.2.3. The NCO continues to hold the flag until hoisted clear of his or her grasp, taking particular care that
         no portion of the flag touches the ground. When the flag is clear of the grasp, the NCO comes to attention and
         executes present arms.
         8.10.2.4. On the last note of the national anthem, ―To the Colors,‖ or after the flag has been hoisted to the staff
         head, all members of the detail execute order arms on command of the senior member. The halyards are then
         secured to the cleat of the staff or, if appropriate, the flag is lowered to halfstaff and the halyards are secured.
         The detail is formed again and then marches to the dismissal area.
    8.10.3. Retreat Ceremony:
         8.10.3.1. The retreat ceremony serves a twofold purpose: signals the end of the official duty day and serves as a
         ceremony for paying respect to the United States flag. Because the time for the end of the duty day varies, the
         commander designates the time for the retreat ceremony. The retreat ceremony may take place at the squadron
         area, on the base parade ground, or near the base flagstaff. If conducted within the squadron area, the ceremony
         usually does not involve a parade. If conducted at the base parade ground, retreat may be part of the parade
         ceremony. For retreat ceremonies conducted at the base flagstaff, the units participating may be formed in line
         or massed, depending on the size and number of units and the space available.
         8.10.3.2. Shortly before the specified time for retreat, the band and Airmen participating in the ceremony are
         positioned facing the flagstaff and dressed. If marching to and from the flagstaff, the band precedes the Airmen
         participating in the ceremony.
         8.10.3.3. If the band and Airmen march to the flagstaff, a flag security detail also marches to the flagstaff and
         halts, and the senior member gives the command ―Parade, REST‖ to the security detail.
         8.10.3.4. As soon as the Airmen are dressed, the commander commands ―Parade, REST.‖ The commander then
         faces the flagstaff, assumes the position of the Airmen, and waits for the specified time for retreat.
         8.10.3.5. At the specified time, the commander orders the bandleader to sound retreat by commanding ―SOUND
         RETREAT.‖
         8.10.3.6. The band plays retreat. If a band is not present, recorded music is played over the base public address
         system. During the playing of retreat, junior members of the flag security detail assume the position of attention
         and move to the flagstaff to arrange the halyards for proper lowering of the flag. Once the halyards are
         arranged, the junior members of the flag security detail execute parade rest in unison.
         8.10.3.7. Uniformed military members not assigned to a formation face the flag (if visible) or the music and
         assume the position of parade rest on the first note of retreat. Upon completion of retreat, they should assume
         the position of attention and salute on the first note of the national anthem or ―To the Colors.‖
         8.10.3.8. After the band plays retreat, the commander faces about and commands ―Squadron (Group, etc.),
         ATTENTION.‖
         8.10.3.9. The commander then commands ―Present, ARMS.‖ As soon as the Airmen execute present arms, the
         commander faces to the front and also assumes present arms. The members of the flag security detail execute
         present arms on command of the commander.
         8.10.3.10. The band plays the national anthem, or the bugler plays ―To the Colors.‖ The junior members of the
         flag security detail lower the flag slowly and with dignity.
         8.10.3.11. The commander executes order arms when the last note of the national anthem or ―To the Colors‖ is
         played and the flag is securely grasped. The commander faces about, gives the Airmen ―Order, ARMS,‖ and
         then faces to the front.
         8.10.3.12. The flag security detail folds the flag as illustrated in Figure 8.17. The senior member of the detail
         remains at attention while the flag is folded unless needed to control the flag.
         8.10.3.13. When the flag is folded, the flag security detail, with the senior member on the right and the flag
         bearer in the center, marches to a position three paces from the commander. (Note: In an informal ceremony,
         the detail marches three paces from the officer of the day.) The senior member salutes and reports ―Sir
170                                                                                    1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
            (Ma‘am), the flag is secured.‖ The commander returns the salute, and the flag security detail marches away. The
            Airmen are then marched to their areas and dismissed.
      8.10.4. Lowering the Flag:
            8.10.4.1. When practical, the persons lowering the flag should be one NCO and three Airmen for the all-purpose
            flag and one NCO and five Airmen for the installation flag.
            8.10.4.2. The detail is formed and marched to the flagstaff. The halyards are detached and attended from the
            leeward side.
            8.10.4.3. On the first note of the national anthem or ―To the Colors,‖ the members of the detail not lowering the
            flag execute present arms. The lowering of the flag is coordinated with the playing of the music so the two are
            completed at the same time.
            8.10.4.4. The senior member commands the detail ―Order, ARMS‖ when the flag is low enough to be received.
            If at halfstaff, briskly hoist the flag to the staff head while retreat is sounded and then lower on the first note of
            the national anthem or ―To the Colors.‖
            8.10.4.5. The flag is detached from the halyards and folded. The halyards are secured to the staff.
      8.10.5. Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag.
            In military formations and ceremonies, the Pledge of Allegiance is not recited. At protocol functions and social
            and sporting events that include civilian participants, military personnel:
            8.10.5.1. When in uniform outdoors, stand at attention, remain silent, face the flag, and render the hand salute.
            8.10.5.2. When in uniform indoors, stand at attention, remain silent, and face the flag. Do not render the hand
            salute. If the participants are primarily civilians and military in civilian attire, reciting the Pledge of Allegiance
            is optional for those in uniform.
            8.10.5.3. When in civilian attire, recite the Pledge of Allegiance standing at attention, facing the flag with the
            right hand over the heart. Men should remove head cover with the right hand and hold it over their left shoulder,
            hand over the heart.
      8.10.6. Flag Folding Ceremony.
            Although several flag folding ceremony options are offered by various national interest groups, these are not
            official Air Force ceremonies. According to Title 4, USC, no specific meaning is assigned to the folds of the
            flag. The only authorized flag folding script is the script developed by the Air Force that provides an historical
            perspective on the flag of the United States. See Figure 8.17 for the proper method for folding the United States
            flag and Figure 8.18 for a copy of this script.
8.11. Air Force Ceremonies.
      The Air Force has many different types of ceremonies that are unique customs of our military profession. Some of
      these ceremonies are very formal and elaborate, while others are quite simple and personal. Award, decoration,
      promotion, reenlistment, and retirement ceremonies are a few of the most common within the Air Force.
      8.11.1. Award Ceremony.
            An award ceremony affords an opportunity to recognize a member‘s accomplishments. The commander or
            other official determines whether to present an award at a formal ceremony or to present it informally. Many
            units present awards during commander‘s call. Because there are no specific guidelines for an award
            presentation, commanders and supervisors must ensure the presentation method reflects the significance of the
            award.
      8.11.2. Decoration Ceremony:
            8.11.2.1. Basic Guidelines. Decoration ceremonies formally recognize service members for meritorious
            service, outstanding achievement, or heroism. A formal and dignified ceremony is necessary to preserve the
            integrity and value of decorations. When possible, the commander should personally present the decoration.
            Regardless of where the presentation is conducted, the ceremony is conducted at the earliest possible date after
            approval of the decoration. All military participants and attendees should wear the uniform specified by the
            host. If in doubt, the Service Dress rather than the airman battle uniform (ABU) is recommended. At the
            commander‘s discretion, a photographer may take pictures during the ceremony.
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                     171

Figure 8.17. Folding the United States Flag.




            8.11.2.2. Procedures. Although decoration ceremonies may differ slightly from one unit to another, they
            normally begin by announcing ―ATTENTION TO ORDERS.‖ All members in attendance stand at attention and
            face the commander and the recipient. The commander‘s assistant reads the citation while the commander and
            recipient stand at attention. After the citation is read, the commander and recipient face each other, and the
            commander affixes the medal on the individual‘s uniform. The commander next extends personal
            congratulations and a handshake while presenting the decoration certificate. The recipient salutes the
            commander, and the commander returns the salute to conclude the formal part of the ceremony. Attendees are
            then invited to personally congratulate the recipient and enjoy any refreshments provided.

                                                           Air Force Script
For more than 200 years, the American flag has been the symbol of our Nation‘s unity, as well as a source of pride and inspiration
for millions of citizens.
Born on June 14, 1777, the Second Continental Congress determined that the flag of the United States be 13 stripes, alternating
between 7 red and 6 white; and that the union be 13 stars, white in a blue field representing a new constellation. (1)
Between 1777 and 1960, the shape and design of the flag evolved into the flag presented before you today. The 13 horizontal
stripes represent the original 13 colonies, while the stars represent the 50 states of the Union. The colors of the flag are symbolic as
well; red symbolizes hardiness and valor; white signifies purity and innocence; and blue represents vigilance, perseverance, and
justice. (1)
Traditionally, a symbol of liberty, the American flag has carried the message of freedom, and inspired Americans, both at home and
abroad.
In 1814, Francis Scott Key was so moved at seeing the Stars and Stripes waving after the British shelling of Baltimore‘s Fort
McHenry that he wrote the words to The Star Spangled Banner. (2)
In 1892 the flag inspired Francis Bellamy to write the ―Pledge of Allegiance,‖ our most famous flag salute and patriotic oath. (2)
In July 1969 the American flag was ―flown‖ in space when Neil Armstrong planted it on the surface of the moon. (2)
Today, our flag flies on constellations of Air Force satellites that circle our globe, and on the fin flash of our aircraft in harm‘s way
in every corner of the world. Indeed, it flies in the heart of every Airman who serves our great Nation. The sun never sets on our
United States Air Force, nor on the flag we so proudly cherish. (2)
Since 1776, no generation of Americans has been spared the responsibility of defending freedom… Today‘s Airmen remain
committed to preserving the freedom that others won for us for generations to come.
By displaying the flag and giving it a distinctive fold we show respect to the flag and express our gratitude to those individuals who
fought, and continue to fight for freedom, at home and abroad. Since the dawn of the 20th century, Airmen have proudly flown the
flag in every major conflict on lands and skies around the world. It is their responsibility…our responsibility…to continue to
protect and preserve the rights, privileges, and freedoms that we, as Americans, enjoy today.
The United States flag represents who we are. It stands for the freedom we all share and the pride and patriotism we feel for our
country. We cherish its legacy as a beacon of hope to one and all. Long may it wave.
Legend:

       8.11.3. Promotion Ceremony:
              8.11.3.1. Basic Guidelines. Promotions are significant events in the lives of military people. Commanders and
              supervisors are responsible for ensuring their personnel receive proper recognition. Many of the guidelines for
              promotion ceremonies are the same as for decoration ceremonies. Because most promotions are effective the
              first day of the month, the promotion ceremony is customarily conducted on the last duty day before the
              promotion. Some bases hold a base-wide promotion for all promotees; many organizations have operating
              instructions detailing how promotion ceremonies will be conducted.
              8.11.3.2. Procedures. The national anthem, reaffirmation of the Oath of Enlistment, and the Air Force Song are
              options that add decorum to the event.
       8.11.4. Reenlistment Ceremony:
              8.11.4.1. Basic Guidelines. Unit commanders will honor all reenlistees through a dignified reenlistment
              ceremony without special gimmicks or publicity stunts. The Airman may request any commissioned officer to
              perform the ceremony and may invite guests. The member‘s immediate family should be invited. This
              reinforces the fact that when a member makes a commitment to the Air Force, the family is also making a
              commitment. Any active duty, reserve, guard, or retired commissioned officer of the United States Armed
              Forces may perform the ceremony, which may be conducted in any place that lends dignity to the event. The
              United States flag must form a backdrop for the participants. Reenlistees and reenlisting officers must wear an
              authorized uniform for the ceremony. Exception: The uniform requirement is optional for retired officers.
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                         173

            8.11.4.2. Procedures. The core of the ceremony is the Oath of Enlistment. The oath is recited by the officer and
            repeated by the reenlistee. The reenlistee and the officer administering the oath must be physically collocated
            during the ceremony. Once completed, the officer congratulates the reenlistee and invites the other attendees to
            do the same. Refreshments may be served.
      8.11.5. Retirement Ceremony:
            8.11.5.1. Basic Guidelines. Recognition upon retirement is a longstanding tradition of military service. Each
            commander makes sure members leave with a tangible expression of appreciation for their contributions to the
            Air Force and its mission and with the assurance that they will continue to be a part of the Air Force family in
            retirement. Anyone involved in planning a retirement should consult AFI 36-3203, Service Retirements, for
            complete details. The following paragraphs are extracts from AFI 36-3203:
            8.11.5.1.1. Commanders are responsible for ensuring members have a retirement ceremony to recognize their
            contributions. They must offer the retiring member the courtesy of a formal ceremony in keeping with the
            customs and traditions of the Service. If possible, a general officer conducts the ceremony. Ceremonies held as
            part of formal military formations, such as retreats and parades, are further encouraged if conditions permit.
            8.11.5.1.2. During the retirement ceremony, the member receives a certificate of retirement, the Air Force
            retired lapel button, and appropriate awards, decorations, honors, and letters of appreciation. If possible, avoid
            using ―dummy‖ elements that the member cannot keep. Family members and friends should be invited and
            encouraged to attend the ceremony. Furthermore, the member‘s spouse is customarily presented with a
            certificate of appreciation for the support and sacrifices made during the member‘s career.
            8.11.5.1.3. Commanders follow formal ceremony procedures unless the member prefers otherwise. If the
            member doesn‘t want a formal ceremony or for any reason (leave or hospitalization) can‘t be present for duty
            on the retirement date, the commander personally presents all decorations and any awards or honors to the
            member at another time. The retirement certificate is not mailed to the member‘s retirement address unless there
            is no other choice.
            8.11.5.2. Procedures. AFPAM 34-1202 outlines an approved sequence of events for indoor retirement
            ceremonies. Figure 8.19 provides a general guideline that may be used to assist in planning a retirement
            ceremony as well as many other ceremonies.
8.12. Special Ceremonies and Events.
      The Dining-In, Dining-Out, and Order of the Sword Induction ceremonies are social events that have become valued
      traditions in the military.
      8.12.1. The Dining-In and Dining-Out:
            8.12.1.1. The only difference between a Dining-In and Dining-Out is that nonmilitary spouses, friends, and
            civilians may attend a Dining-Out. The Dining-In is a formal dinner for military members only. The present
            Dining-In format had its beginnings in the Air Corps when General Henry H. ―Hap‖ Arnold held his famous
            wingdings. The association of Army Air Corps personnel with the British and their Dining-In during World
            War II (WWII) also encouraged their popularity in the Air Force. Members now recognize the Dining-In as an
            occasion where ceremony, tradition, and good fellowship serve an important purpose.

            8.12.1.2. Specifically, these ceremonies provide an occasion for Air Force members to meet socially at formal
            military functions. They also provide an excellent means of saying farewell to departing members and
            welcoming new ones, as well as providing the opportunity to recognize individual and unit achievements. These
            are effective in building and maintaining high morale and esprit de corps. Military members who attend these
            ceremonies must wear the mess dress or the semiformal uniform. Civilians wear the dress specified in the
            invitations.
      8.12.2. The Order of the Sword Induction Ceremony.
            Induction into the Order of the Sword is an honor reserved for individuals who have provided outstanding
            leadership and support to enlisted members. The induction ceremony occurs at a formal evening banquet held to
            honor the inductee as a ―Leader among Leaders and an Airman among Airmen.‖ The entire event is conducted
            with the dignity that reflects its significance as the highest recognition enlisted member can bestow on anyone.
            Each command has an Order of the Sword and develops its own selection and induction procedures.

Figure 8.19. General Guideline for Planning a Retirement Ceremony.
 Appoint someone to set up the ceremony.
 Notify the honoree to ensure the date and times are good. Select and reserve a location for the ceremony.
 Determine whom the honoree would like to assist with the ceremony honors and have the honoree extend the invitation.
 Mail personal invitations to guests (optional) or use AFIT‘s ―E-Invitations‖ free web application at:
  https://einvitations.afit.edu/generator/index.cfm.
 Ensure all award elements and certificates are ready. Select an emcee and individuals to act as escorts to any special
  guests as required.
 Request photographic support from the multimedia center.
 Ensure media equipment, if appropriate, is available. Recommend a ―walk through‖ of the actual ceremony.
 Order refreshments.
 Print programs and make or obtain signs for seating and parking for special guests. Verify the guest list with the honoree
  and obtain special guest information (relationship, title, and correct spelling of name). Provide guest information, agenda,
  proposed remarks, applicable biographies or personnel records, and honoree‘s personal data to the officiating officer and
  emcee.
 Perform a ―dry run‖ of the ceremony with all key players.
 Set up the location at least 2 hours before the ceremony. Meet with the honoree to go over last-minute details.
 The honoree and special guests often meet with the officiating officer just before the ceremony. The ceremony begins
  with the emcee announcing their arrival at the ceremony location.
 The emcee welcomes everyone and introduces the special guests.
 The emcee or officiating officer provides career highlights of the honoree.
 The emcee reads the special order of the honoree and the officiating officer performs ceremony procedures.
 Photos are taken throughout the ceremony.
 The honoree provides remarks.
 The emcee thanks everyone for coming and invites participants to congratulate the honoree and enjoy the refreshments.
8.13. Drill:
       8.13.1. Introduction to Drill.
               For the purpose of drill, Air Force organizations are divided into elements, flights, squadrons, groups, and
               wings. Drill consists of certain movements by which the flight or squadron is moved in an orderly manner from
               one formation to another or from one place to another. Standards such as the 24-inch step, cadence of 100 to
               120 steps per minute, distance, and interval were established to ensure movements are executed with order and
               precision. The task of each person is to learn these movements and execute each part exactly as described.
               Individuals must also learn to adapt their own movements to those of the group. Everyone in the formation must
               move together on command.
       8.13.2. Drill and Ceremony.
               While the term ―ceremony‖ was defined earlier in this chapter, it should be noted that certain ceremonies use
               drill. In these events, ceremonies not only honor distinguished persons and recognize special events, but also
               demonstrate the proficiency and training state of the Airmen. Ceremonies are an extension of drill activities.
               The precision marching, promptness in responding to commands, and teamwork developed on the drill field
               determine the appearance and performance of the group in ceremonies. The following paragraphs cover only the
               basic aspects of drill. For more information, see AFMAN 36-2203, Drill and Ceremonies.
AFPAM36-2241     1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                            175

    8.13.3. Types of Commands:
          8.13.3.1. Drill Command. A drill command is an oral order that usually has two parts: the preparatory
          command and the command of execution. The preparatory command explains what the movement will be.
          When calling a unit to attention or halting a unit‘s march, the preparatory command includes the unit
          designation. In the command ―Flight, HALT,‖ the word ―Flight‖ is the preparatory command and, at the same
          time, designates the unit. The command of execution follows the preparatory command. The command of
          execution explains when the movement will be carried out. In ―Forward, MARCH,‖ the command of execution
          is ―MARCH.‖
          8.13.3.2. Supplementary Command. A supplementary command is given when one unit of the element must
          execute a movement different from other units or the same movement at a different time. Examples include:
          ―CONTINUE THE MARCH‖ and ―STAND FAST.‖
          8.13.3.3. Informational Command. An informational command has no preparatory command or command of
          execution and is not supplementary; this command is used to direct others to give commands. Examples are:
          ―PREPARE FOR INSPECTION‖ and ―DISMISS THE SQUADRON.‖
          8.13.3.4. Mass Commands. The mass commands help develop confidence, self-reliance, assertiveness, and
          enthusiasm by making the individual recall, give, and execute proper commands. Mass commands are usually
          confined to simple movements, with short preparatory commands and commands of execution carried out
          simultaneously by all elements of a unit. Each person is required to give commands in unison with others as if
          this person alone were giving the commands to the entire element. The volume of the combined voices
          encourages every person to perform the movement with snap and precision.
    8.13.4. General Rules for Giving Commands.
          When giving commands, the commander is at the position of attention. Good military bearing is necessary for
          good leadership. While marching, the commander must be in step with the formation at all times. The
          commander faces the Airmen when giving commands except when the element is part of a larger drill element
          or when the commander is relaying commands in a ceremony.
    8.13.5. Drill Positions:
          8.13.5.1. Attention. To come to attention, bring the heels together smartly and on line. Place the heels as near
          each other as the conformation of the body permits and ensure the feet are turned out equally to form a 45-
          degree angle. Keep the legs straight without stiffening or locking the knees. The body is erect with hips level,
          chest lifted, back arched, and shoulders square and even. Arms hang straight down alongside the body without
          stiffness and the wrists are straight with the forearms. Place thumbs, which are resting along the first joint of the
          forefinger, along the seams of the trousers or sides of the skirt. Hands are cupped (but not clenched as a fist)
          with palms facing the leg. The head is kept erect and held straight to the front, with the chin drawn slightly so
          the axis of the head and neck is vertical; eyes are to the front with the line of sight parallel to the ground. The
          weight of the body rests equally on the heels and balls of both feet. Silence and immobility are required.
          8.13.5.2. Rest Positions. There are four positions of rest: parade rest, at ease, rest, and fall out. The commander
          and members of the formation must be at the position of attention before going to any of the rest positions. To
          resume the position of attention from any of the rests (except fall out, for which the commander uses the
          command ―FALL IN‖), the command is ―Flight, ATTENTION.‖
          8.13.5.2.1. Parade Rest. (The command is ―Parade, REST.‖) On the command ―REST,‖ members of the
          formation raise the left foot from the hip just enough to clear the ground and move it smartly to the left so the
          heels are 12 inches apart, as measured from the inside of the heels. Keep the legs straight but not stiff and the
          heels on line. As the left foot moves, bring the arms, fully extended, to the back of the body, uncupping the
          hands in the process; extend and join the fingers, pointing them toward the ground. Face the palms outwards.
          Place the right hand in the palm of the left, right thumb over the left to form an ―X.‖ Keep the head and eyes
          straight ahead and remain silent and immobile.
          8.13.5.2.2. At Ease. On the command ―AT EASE,‖ members of the formation may relax in a standing position,
          but they must keep the right foot in place. Their position in the formation will not change; silence is maintained.
          8.13.5.2.3. Rest. On the command ―REST,‖ the same requirements for at ease apply, but moderate speech is
          permitted.
176                                                                                  1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
            8.13.5.2.4. Fall Out. On the command ―FALL OUT,‖ individuals may relax in a standing position or break
            ranks. They must remain in the immediate area; no specific method of dispersal is required. Moderate speech is
            permitted.
      8.13.6. The Flight as the Basic Drill Unit.
            The first phase of drill involves teaching basic movements, facings, and positions either as an individual or as a
            member of an element. The second phase of drill merges the individual with others to form a flight in which
            base formations and marching are learned. The flight is composed of at least two, but no more than four,
            elements. This formation is the most practical drill group.
      8.13.7. Formation of the Flight:
            8.13.7.1. A flight forms in a line formation at the command of ―FALL IN‖ (Figure 8.20). Note: Usually, the
            flight sergeant forms and dismisses the flight formation.
Figure 8.20. Flight in Line Formation.




            8.13.7.2. On this command, each Airman will fall in and establish their dress, cover, interval, and distance.
            Once established, each Airman executes an automatic ready front on an individual basis and remains at the
            position of attention.
Figure 8.21. Flight in Column Formation.        8.13.7.3. The flight commander will then size the flight. Once all members
                                                are properly sized and in column formation (Figure 8.21), the flight
                                                commander brings the flight back to line formation.
                                                8.13.7.4. To align the flight in line formation, the commands are ―Dress
                                                Right, DRESS‖ and ―Ready, FRONT.‖
                                                8.13.7.5. The flight commander verifies the alignment of each rank then
                                                marches to three paces beyond the front rank, faces toward the flight, and
                                                commands ―Ready, FRONT.‖ With as few movements as possible, the
                                                flight commander then takes the normal position in front of the flight by the
                                                most direct route.
                                                8.13.8. Open Ranks:
                                                8.13.8.1. The command ―Open Ranks, MARCH‖ is only given to a
                                                formation when in line at normal interval. On the command ―MARCH,‖ the
                                                fourth rank stands fast and automatically executes dress right dress. The
                                                third rank takes one pace, the second rank takes two, and the first rank takes
                                                three paces forward. The flight commander aligns the flight, then commands
                                                ―Ready, FRONT.‖
                                                8.13.8.2. The inspector and commander proceed to inspect the flight, if
                                                required.
AFPAM36-2241      1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                          177

           8.13.8.3. After inspecting the entire flight, the inspector marches off to the right flank (element leaders) of the
           flight. The flight commander calls the flight to attention. The flight commander then commands ―Close Ranks,
           MARCH.‖ On the command ―MARCH,‖ the first rank stands fast. The second rank takes one pace forward and
           halts at the position of attention. The third and fourth ranks take two and three paces forward, respectively, and
           halt at attention.

Section 8E—Honor Guard
8.14. Base Honor Guard Program:
     8.14.1. The primary mission of the base honor guard program is to employ, equip, and train Air Force members to
     provide professional military funeral honors for active duty, retired members, and veterans of the United States Air
     Force. The Base Honor Guard Program is a mandatory Air Force program and is the responsibility of the installation
     commander. Members are usually volunteers from the installation host and tenant units, with selections generally
     coming from the installation‘s airman basic to technical sergeant pool. The base honor guard emphasizes the
     importance of military customs and courtesies, dress and appearance, and drill and ceremonies.
     8.14.2. The origins of the base honor guard can be traced to May 1948 when Headquarters Command, United States
     Air Force, directed the creation of an elite ceremonial unit comparable to those of the other Services. The first base
     honor guard was activated within the 1100th Air Police Squadron, Bolling Field, Washington DC, and was responsible
     for maintaining an Air Force ceremonial capability in the National Capitol Region. However, other Air Force
     installations worldwide approached ceremonial responsibilities and military funeral honors quite differently.
     8.14.3. In January of 2000, public law was implemented, providing for all veterans to receive, at a minimum, a funeral
     ceremony that includes the folding of a United States flag, presentation of the flag to the veteran‘s family, and the
     playing of ―Taps.‖

Section 8F—Protocol
8.15. Protocol Defined.
      Protocol is the set of rules prescribing good manners in official life and in ceremonies involving governments and
      nations and their representatives. Protocol is an internationally recognized system of courtesy and respect. Protocol
      for the military and government agencies is a code of traditional precedence, courtesy, and etiquette in matters of
      military, diplomatic, official, and celebratory ceremonies. Military protocol encompasses the knowledge, accumulation
      and application of established service customs. In modern practice, protocol combines the traditional codes of conduct
      with contemporary etiquette and courtesy. The goal is to avoid disputes, insults, embarrassment, and distractions by
      following a set of objective and generally accepted criteria. As times change, so do the manners of the people; protocol
      must keep pace with developing official life. Though only a guide, the following sections will help you avoid protocol
      pitfalls.

Section 8G—Distinguished Visitors (DV)
8.16. Distinguished Visitors:
      8.16.1. A DV may be defined as any (1) general or flag officer, (2) government official with rank equivalent to a
      brigadier general or higher, (3) foreign military officer or civilian designated a DV by the Under Secretary of the Air
      Force for International Affairs (SAF/IA), and (4) visitor or group designated by the commander. Also, persons of
      lower rank, but in certain positions, may be given DV status. At base level, for example, colonels, civilian equivalents,
      and the command chief master sergeant (CCM) may be designated as DV by the commander. Many distinguished
      dignitaries, military and civilian, domestic and foreign, visit Air Force installations for festive occasions and official
      business. Reducing the frequency of ceremonial honors rendered official visitors at field installations is of high
      importance. In the interest of economy and efficiency, such ceremonies as parades, honor cordons, motorcades, and
      other ceremonies that involve large numbers of Airmen and equipment will be held to an absolute minimum when
      officials entitled to such honors visit military installations. In general, full honors are reserved for statutory appointees
      and general or flag officers of the military Services, foreign dignitaries, and occasions when ceremonies promote
      international good will. The installation commander determines which types of honors are rendered. Enlisted
      personnel are frequently appointed as project NCOs for ceremonies, officials at social events, or escorts for visiting
      DVs.
      8.16.2. Project NCOs represent their organization or their base and are responsible for assisting DVs. A smooth visit
      requires planning before the visit. Review AFI 34-1201 and AFPAM 34-1202 for further guidance on responsibilities
      and proper procedures. Contact guests beforehand to find out if they desire special arrangements. The base protocol
      office may also need to know guests‘ transportation needs. Other duties may include preregistering guests, meeting
      them upon arrival, and escorting them to their next destination.
      8.16.3. Place a tentative itinerary and welcome package in the guest quarters. Include such items as a recent base
      newspaper, unit or base history, telephone numbers of base facilities, maps of the base and local area, and most
      importantly, the visit point of contact (POC) information. Also appropriate are biographies on the installation or host
      commander and CCM, host Professional Military Education commandants and program managers, and CMSgts and
      first sergeants (in the case of a senior enlisted DV, such as the Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force [CMSAF]).
      Include instructions on operating difficult-to-use appliances or machines, using the telephone system, and computer
      connection information in the guest quarters.
      8.16.4. Give a thorough prebriefing to the guest speaker at a special function, such as a Dining-In. Guests may have
      several commitments other than the primary project. If so, make sure they have schedules that allow time for meetings,
      telephone calls, meals, changes of clothes, coffee breaks, occasional rest periods, and transportation. Common practice
      is to leave 2 hours between the end-of-the-day activities and the start of evening functions.
      8.16.5. Determine transportation time by physically traveling from place to place before the schedule is set. Allow
      extra time for boarding vehicles and transferring baggage or luggage. For large official parties, be sure to brief all
      drivers on the schedule and give explicit directions so they can operate independently if they become separated.
      Ensure they ―dry run‖ the routes to avoid delays due to roadwork, stoplight outages, or road closures. Arrange the
      lodging checkout time and bill payment method. Arrange flight meals if the guests are leaving by military aircraft and
      desire this service. Smooth visits can make a lasting positive impression. If you run into difficulty or have questions,
      do not hesitate to contact the base protocol office.

      8.16.6. A DV‘s visit is an important event in the day-to-day life of an organization. Everyone wants to make a good
      impression whether the visitor is a representative of Congress, foreign dignitary, or city mayor. Problems with these
      visits are avoided through strict attention to detail from the preplanning for arrival to luggage handling, dinner
      arrangements, and departure plans. Remember, you never get a second chance to make a good first impression.

Section 8H—Military Ceremonies
8.17. General Information.
      The enlisted corps has a variety of programs to recognize individuals for outstanding performance, achievements,
      contributions, and promotions to the senior noncommissioned officer (SNCO) grades. AFI 36-2805, Special Trophies
      and Awards, provides information on a variety of programs but is not all-inclusive. SNCOs should become familiar
      with the induction of newly promoted MSgts into the ―Top 3.‖ They should also become familiar with the Order of the
      Sword Ceremony (reference AFI 36-2824, Order of the Sword Programs) and retirement ceremonies.
8.18. Order of the Sword:
      8.18.1. Background:
            8.18.1.1. The Order of the Sword is patterned after an order of chivalry founded during the Middle Ages—the
            Swedish Royal Order of the Sword. The rank of NCO was established in the early 12th century. In 1522,
            Swedish King Gustavus I enjoined the noblemen commissioned by him to appoint officers to serve him. Those
            appointed were accountants, builders, crafts people, teachers, scribes, and others conducting the daily kingdom
            affairs. The system worked so well it was incorporated into the Swedish Army as a way to establish and
            maintain a cohesive, disciplined, and well-trained force. This force ensured the protection of lives and property
            in the kingdom.
            8.18.1.2. Ancient NCOs would honor their leader and pledge their loyalty by ceremoniously presenting him
            with a sword. The sword—a symbol of truth, justice, and power rightfully used—served as a token for all to see
            and know that here was a ―leader among leaders.‖ The ceremony became known as The Royal Order of the
            Sword. The first recorded use of it in the United States was in the 1860s when General Robert E. Lee was
            presented a sword by his command.
      8.18.2. The Current Ceremony.
            The Royal Order of the Sword ceremony was revised, updated, and adopted by Air Force NCOs in 1967. The
            Order of the Sword was established by the Air Force enlisted force to recognize and honor military senior
            officers, colonel or above, and civilian equivalents, for conspicuous and significant contributions to the welfare
            and prestige of the Air Force enlisted force mission effectiveness as well as the overall military establishment.
            The Order of the Sword is the highest honor and tribute NCOs can bestow upon an individual.
      8.18.3. Approved Swords.
            The only approved swords are at the Air Force level (Air Force Sword) and MAJCOM level (MAJCOM
            Sword). The Air Force Sword is reserved for those deserving senior leaders who serve outside the MAJCOM
            structure. The CMSAF maintains the Air Force Sword. MAJCOM CCMs maintain the MAJCOM Swords and
            ensure they are reserved for those deserving senior leaders who serve or have served within the awarding
            MAJCOM. Each MAJCOM establishes additional guidelines not already covered in AFI 36-2824. An Order of
            the Sword committee serves as the executive agent and is responsible for developing guidelines, nomination
            procedures, approval or disapproval of any nominations submitted, and protocol of the induction ceremony. The
            committee must also approve the nomination. The CMSAF or MAJCOM‘s CCM (depending on level of
            award), is known as the ―keeper of the sword,‖ and usually chairs the committee.
      8.18.4. Nomination and Selection.
            NCOs wishing to nominate a qualified officer or civilian for induction into the Order of the Sword should
            contact their CCM and refer to AFI 36-2824 for processing procedures. (Note: Do not inform the nominee of
            the possible induction.) The nomination folder should include a cover memorandum, biographical sketch, and
            brief justification. Ensure the nomination is thorough enough so the committee can carefully weigh the
            individual‘s merits. The CMSAF or MAJCOM CCM (depending on level of award) informs the nominating
            organization of the decision and provides appropriate guidance and procedures as necessary.
AFPAM36-2241        1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                          181

      8.18.5. Preparation for the Ceremony.
            Once the nomination is approved, a ceremony committee will form and begin planning the ceremony.
            Preparations required for the Order of the Sword ceremony are similar to those for the Dining-In discussed in
            this chapter. Host NCOs are responsible for planning, executing, and paying for the ceremony. This includes the
            dinner, awards and presentations to be made to the honoree, ceremonial equipment (such as individual swords),
            and printed proclamations.
      8.18.6. Induction Ceremony.
            This evening affair usually consists of a social period, formal dinner, and induction ceremony. The required
            dress is the mess dress or semiformal uniform. The ceremony should be well rehearsed so it reflects formality,
            dignity, and prestige. Four key participants have speaking parts and other duties: the chief master sergeant of
            the mess, first sergeant, duty sergeant, and sergeant at arms. MAJCOM directives provide specific guidance for
            NCOs serving in these positions.
      8.18.7. Permanent Recognition in the Order of the Sword.
            The CMSAF maintains the official list of Order of the Sword recipients. Each sponsoring command maintains a
            master sword designed for its ceremonies. This sword is on display at each command‘s headquarters. A
            nameplate commemorating the command‘s inductions is affixed to its command master sword.
8.19. Conclusion.
      Military customs and courtesies are proven traditions, acts of respect and courtesy, and signs of the mutual respect and
      fraternity that exist among military personnel. Military customs and courtesies play an extremely important role in
      building morale, esprit de corps, discipline, and mission effectiveness. This chapter outlines customs and courtesies,
      providing an extensive but not all-inclusive outline of what makes the Air Force and its people special. These
      ceremonies represent many customs and traditions of our Air Force heritage. They are very real aspects of life, and, in
      the aggregate, form the special culture and lifestyle uniquely characteristic of the military profession. This guidance is
      offered to empower you with the knowledge that can add comfort to your daily social interactions. Apply it using
      common sense. The guidelines in this chapter can help avoid protocol pitfalls.

          My advice to tomorrow‘s senior NCOs is to listen, to learn, and then to serve with unequaled
          commitment. Their example will motivate and inspire, and when they, in turn, pass the baton, America
          will certainly be in good hands.

                                                                    Former Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force (CMSAF) #4
Section 9A—Overview
9.1. Introduction.
      Noncommissioned officers (NCO) are the backbone of the Air Force. The organization‘s success or failure, strengths
      or weaknesses can be directly related to the effectiveness of its NCOs. Although most Airmen are aware of their
      responsibilities, an overview of both general and specific responsibilities may be necessary, especially as the Airmen
      progress in rank. This chapter begins by discussing the philosophy, purpose, and structure of the enlisted force, and
      examines the NCO in terms of rank and precedence, legal authority, and general and specific responsibilities. In
      addition, it briefly describes those special positions entrusted to senior noncommissioned officers (SNCO), such as Air
      Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM), first sergeant, command chief master sergeant (CCM), and Chief Master
      Sergeant of the Air Force (CMSAF). The chapter also discusses the military as a Profession of Arms. The essential
      purpose of an organized military force is to defend the interests of the state, by force of arms if necessary. This task is
      unique to the military profession. There are those who have tried to compare the responsibilities of military officers to
      business executives. Both occupations call for leadership abilities and involve the management of human and material
      resources. But, what business expects its executives to be available for work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, ready to
      risk their lives on behalf of its stockholders? Most assuredly, executive job descriptions do not include the
      responsibility to lead others to their deaths. At its heart, the military profession is a calling that requires devotion to
      service and willingness to sacrifice far beyond that required in the marketplace. The military as a profession and its
      core values and supporting ideas are concepts that epitomize the ―NCO.‖

Section 9B—The Enlisted Force Structure
9.2. Philosophy:
      9.2.1. The enlisted force is a diverse corps of functionally and operationally specialized Airmen. Yet, despite the
      natural differences found across functional and operational lines, there is a compelling need for a common approach to
      career progression, professional development, and the assumption of increased supervisory and leadership
      responsibilities. To best leverage our resources we must have consistent, well-defined expectations, standards, and
      opportunities for growth for all Airmen, regardless of specialty or command. The enlisted force structure provides this
      consistency and common approach. It is the enlisted force structure that defines us as Airmen, rather than merely
      specialists.
      9.2.2. All elements of the enlisted force structure reflect the Air Force core values (Integrity First, Service Before Self,
      and Excellence in All We Do), and are essential to the profession of arms. The core values are the basis for Air Force
      policies, guidance, and overall focus.
9.3. Purpose of the Enlisted Force Structure:
      9.3.1. Provide an enlisted force structure that best meets mission requirements.
      9.3.2. Provide a common, stable career structure for all enlisted personnel.
      9.3.3. Provide all Airmen the opportunity for professional growth.
      9.3.4. Define:
             9.3.4.1. The three tiers of the enlisted force structure.
             9.3.4.2. The three levels of enlisted leadership and development.
             9.3.4.3. The roles, responsibilities, expectations, and official terms of address for each enlisted rank.

9.4. Three Enlisted Force Structure Tiers.
      The enlisted force is comprised of three distinct and separate tiers, each correlating to increased levels of training,
      education, technical competence, experience, leadership, and managerial responsibilities. These tiers are Junior
      Enlisted Airman, NCO, and SNCO.
      9.4.1. The Junior Enlisted Airman Tier.
            This tier consists of airman basic (AB), airman (Amn), airman first class (A1C), and senior airman (SrA). These
            Airmen are initially focused on adapting to the requirements of the military profession, achieving technical
            proficiency, and learning to be highly productive members of the Air Force. Once promoted to SrA, they begin
            to exercise limited supervision and leadership as they prepare for increased responsibilities, while continuing to
            broaden their technical skills.
      9.4.2. The NCO Tier.
            This tier consists of staff sergeant (SSgt) and technical sergeant (TSgt). NCOs continue their technical growth,
            become expert hands-on technicians, and serve as first-line supervisors. NCOs ensure their team members work
            together to accomplish the mission. NCOs are responsible for training and developing the Airmen they
            supervise to become future NCOs. They also continue to develop their own leadership skills in preparation for
            increased responsibilities.
      9.4.3. The SNCO Tier.
            This tier consists of master sergeant (MSgt), senior master sergeant (SMSgt), and chief master sergeant
            (CMSgt). SNCOs are a critical component of the Air Force‘s ability to project air power. SNCOs have a great
            deal of experience and leadership ability, which they use to leverage resources and personnel against a variety
            of mission requirements. The SNCO‘s primary focus is on accomplishing the organization‘s mission through
            the skillful use of teams. They also concentrate on further developing their teams and people, both technically
            and professionally. They participate in the decisionmaking process, as appropriate, on a variety of technical,
            operational, and organizational issues. A few go on to serve at the highest levels in the Air Force as strategic
            leaders and managers.
9.5. Three Enlisted Leadership and Development Levels.
      The three leadership and development levels in the Air Force are tactical, operational, and strategic. These levels
      directly correlate to the scope of an enlisted person‘s duties and primary responsibilities, mission requirements, and the
      type of development needed to serve at each level. These levels apply across the spectrum of the enlisted force
      structure (Figure 9.1).
      9.5.1. Tactical Level.
            This level of leadership normally applies to ABs through TSgts. At the tactical level, Airmen and NCOs perfect
            their primary skills. They are trained, attend professional military education (PME), and achieve their 5- and 7-
            skill levels. They strive to become the best technicians and team members possible. As they increase in rank,
            they also begin to train others and serve as first-line supervisors and noncommissioned officers in charge
            [NCOIC] of sections. (Note: Only NCOs and SNCOs may serve as NCOICs.) The primary focus at the tactical
            level is accomplishing all assigned work as efficiently as possible using available personnel and resources.
      9.5.2. Operational Level.
            This level normally applies to MSgts through CMSgts who typically work at the numbered Air Force (NAF)
            level and below. This is where SNCOs transition from being expert technicians and first-line supervisors to
            leaders with broader operational leadership, supervisory, and managerial responsibilities. They continue to
            develop their expertise, experience, and management and leadership skills to convert leadership direction into
            mission accomplishment. The majority of our enlisted force will spend their entire careers at the tactical and
            operational levels. This is where their natural strengths of competencies, experience, and day-to-day mission
            focus are most required.
      9.5.3. Strategic Level.
            This level normally applies to CMSgts and a few other SNCOs assigned to higher headquarters. These leaders
            serve in key leadership positions at the Department of Defense, Headquarters Air Force, major commands
            (MAJCOM), direct reporting units (DRU), and select agencies and headquarters. They continue to develop their
            knowledge of Air Force institutional management processes, challenges, and vision to improve their ability to
            advise senior leaders, participate in top-level decisionmaking processes, draft policies, manage career fields,
            and lead far-reaching programs. The primary focus at this level is the strategic leadership and management of
            the force to best meet current and future requirements.

9.6. General Junior Enlisted Airman Responsibilities.
      Junior enlisted Airmen must:
      9.6.1. Accept and execute all duties, instructions, responsibilities, and lawful orders in a timely, efficient manner;
      complete assigned tasks and accomplish the mission by being an effective follower; place the requirements of their
      official duties and responsibilities ahead of their personal desires; and issue lawful orders if placed in charge of a work
      activity or in charge of other Airmen to ensure completion of assigned tasks. Failure to obey lawful orders violates
      Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) (duty status determines Air Reserve Component
      authority).
      9.6.2. Strive for and maintain the highest level of personal readiness to meet air and space expeditionary force mission
      requirements. To do so, junior enlisted Airmen must:
            9.6.2.1. Be technically ready to accomplish the mission; attain and maintain a skill level commensurate with
            their rank; and maintain a high degree of proficiency in their awarded specialty as outlined in their career field
            education and training plan (CFETP) (AFPD 36-26, Total Force Development; AFI 36-2201, Air Force
            Training Program).
            9.6.2.2. Be physically ready to accomplish the mission. Keep themselves in good physical condition and meet
            Air Force fitness standards. Participate in the Air Force Fitness Program (AFI 36-2905, Fitness Program).
            9.6.2.3. Be mentally ready to accomplish the mission. Issues involving quality of life, financial problems, sexual
            harassment, discrimination, stress, marital problems, and substance abuse can affect and detract from mental
            readiness. These types of issues can prevent individuals from focusing on the mission, diminish motivation,
            erode a positive attitude, and reduce the quality of work. All of this negatively impacts mission
            accomplishment. As it relates to mental readiness, junior enlisted Airmen should:
186                                                                                    1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
            9.6.2.3.1. Seek assistance through their supervisory chain, first sergeant, commander, chaplain, or appropriate
            referral agencies when having difficulty dealing with the issues identified in paragraph 9.6.2.3. Airmen are
            expected to take positive steps to resolve these issues in a responsible manner.
            9.6.2.3.2. Actively support the Air Force policy of zero tolerance for discrimination and sexual harassment.
            Airmen must help maintain an environment free from behavior that hinders other team members‘ ability to
            achieve their full potential and maximize their contributions (AFI 36-2706, Equal Opportunity Program
            Military and Civilian).
            9.6.2.3.3. Be alert to detect people who may be exhibiting suicidal behavior and immediately report it to their
            supervisory chain, first sergeant, or commander. Fellow Airmen are very important to suicide prevention.
            9.6.2.4. Be spiritually ready to accomplish the mission. Spiritual readiness is the development of those personal
            qualities needed to help a person through times of stress, hardship, and tragedy (AFI 36-2618, The Enlisted
            Force Structure). Spiritual readiness may or may not include religious activities.
            9.6.2.5. Meet all predeployment requirements if postured to deploy.
      9.6.3. Exhibit professional behavior, military bearing, respect for authority, and high standards of dress and personal
      appearance on and off duty. Airmen should correct other Airmen who violate standards (AFPD 36-29, Military
      Standards; AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel; and AFI 36-2909, Professional and
      Unprofessional Relationships).
9.7. Specific Junior Enlisted Airman Responsibilities:
      9.7.1. AB.
            ABs are primarily in a learning capacity, adapting to the requirements of the military profession, acquiring
            knowledge of military customs, courtesies, and Air Force standards, as well as striving to attain technical
            proficiency. They can perform basic tasks under close supervision when at their first duty station. ABs operate
            at the tactical level. The official term of address is Airman Basic or Airman.
      9.7.2. Amn.
            Amn, while still learning and adapting to the military profession, are expected to understand and conform to
            military standards, customs, and courtesies. Amn begin to show job proficiency at basic tasks and still require
            significant supervision and support. Amn operate at the tactical level. The official term of address is Airman.
      9.7.3. A1C.
            A1Cs must fully comply with Air Force standards and are expected to devote their efforts to the mastery of
            skills required in their career fields and the military profession, while becoming effective team members. After
            a few months at their first duty station, they are usually skilled on numerous tasks. Continued supervision is
            essential to the A1C‘s ongoing technical and professional growth. They typically earn their 5-skill level at this
            grade. A1Cs operate at the tactical level. The official term of address is Airman First Class or Airman.
      9.7.4. SrA.
            SrA commonly perform as skilled technicians and trainers. It is essential SrA begin developing supervisory and
            leadership skills through progressive responsibility on the job, PME, individual study, and supervisor
            mentoring. When utilized as supervisors, SrA strive to establish themselves as effective first-line supervisors
            through maximum use of guidance and assistance from the NCOs above them. SrA may serve as reporting
            officials upon completion of Airman Leadership School (ALS). SrA operate at the tactical level. The official
            term of address is Senior Airman or Airman.
9.8. General NCO Responsibilities.
      NCOs must:
      9.8.1. Accept and execute all duties, instructions, responsibilities, and lawful orders in a timely, efficient manner; lead
      subordinates and exercise effective followership in mission accomplishment; and place the requirements of their
      official duties and responsibilities ahead of their personal desires. NCOs have the authority to issue lawful orders
      appropriate for the completion of their assigned tasks. Failure to obey lawful orders violates Article 92 of the UCMJ
      (duty status determines air reserve component authority).
AFPAM36-2241     1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                               187

    9.8.2. Maintain the highest level of readiness to meet air and space expeditionary force mission requirements. An
    NCO‘s primary purpose in the Air Force is to be a skilled technician in his or her assigned specialty and to build,
    prepare, and lead teams to accomplish the mission. NCOs must:
          9.8.2.1. Be technically ready to accomplish the mission. NCOs must also attain and maintain a skill level
          commensurate with their rank and maintain a high degree of proficiency in their duties as outlined in their
          CFETP. Additionally, they must train and develop their subordinates to ensure they are also technically ready to
          accomplish the mission.
          9.8.2.2. Be physically ready to accomplish the mission; attain and maintain good physical conditioning, meet
          Air Force fitness standards, and set a positive example for subordinates; lead the way by promoting, supporting,
          and participating in the Air Force Fitness Program and unit physical training programs; and incorporate physical
          training into team duty schedules (AFI 36-2905).
          9.8.2.3. Be mentally ready to accomplish the mission. Issues involving quality of life, financial problems, sexual
          harassment, discrimination, stress, marital problems, and substance abuse can affect and detract from mental
          readiness. These types of issues can prevent individuals from focusing on the mission, diminish motivation,
          erode a positive attitude, and reduce the quality of work. NCOs must also monitor and address issues negatively
          impacting subordinates‘ mental readiness. NCOs must:
          9.8.2.3.1. Consult their supervisory chain, their first sergeant, commander, chaplain, or appropriate referral
          agencies if they experience problems dealing with the issues in paragraph 9.8.2.3 and require assistance. NCOs
          must always take positive steps to resolve these types of issues in a responsible manner.
          9.8.2.3.2. Assist subordinates in resolving personal, financial, marital, alcohol, and stress-related problems.
          Supervisors are often in the best position to detect early indications of these problems and are key to
          identifying, addressing, and resolving them. Supervisors must stay involved and be supportive as their
          subordinates struggle to resolve their problems. Supervisors must also clarify Air Force standards, provide
          feedback on duty performance, and provide counseling on professional behavior, military bearing, and available
          referral agencies. If additional assistance is required, NCOs must consult their supervisory chain, their first
          sergeant, chaplain, or appropriate referral agency (AFPD 36-29; AFI 36-2406, Officer and Enlisted Evaluation
          Systems; AFI 36-2909; AFI 44-121, Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT) Program;
          AFI 44-120, Military Drug Demand Reduction Program).
          9.8.2.3.3. Actively support the Air Force‘s policy of ―zero tolerance‖ for discrimination and sexual harassment.
          NCOs must maintain a professional environment that enables personnel to achieve their full potential and
          maximize their contributions (AFI 36-2706).
          9.8.2.3.4. Remain watchful for signs that subordinates, or any Air Force member, may be suicidal. Supervisors
          are often in the best position to detect early signs of suicidal behavior. If an NCO notices a person is exhibiting
          behavior indicating he or she may be suicidal, the NCO should ask the person directly if he or she is thinking of
          hurting him or herself. NCOs must then immediately seek assistance from the first sergeant, commander,
          security forces, chaplain, life skills support center, or medical personnel, and remain with the person until
          relieved by the proper authority.
          9.8.2.3.5. Frequently visit dining facilities, chapel centers, recreation facilities, dormitories, and enlisted clubs to
          familiarize themselves with their subordinates‘ off-duty opportunities and living conditions.
          9.8.2.3.6. Hold subordinates accountable when they do not meet established standards. NCOs must also
          appropriately recognize and reward those individuals whose military conduct and duty performance clearly
          exceed established standards.
          9.8.2.4. Be spiritually ready to accomplish the mission. Spiritual readiness is the development of those personal
          qualities needed to help a person through times of stress, hardship, and tragedy. NCOs must also provide
          assistance to subordinates who may be struggling with their spiritual readiness through the chaplain, life skills
          support center, or other support agencies. Spiritual readiness may or may not include religious activities.
          9.8.2.5. Meet all predeployment requirements if postured to deploy. NCOs must also ensure they educate and
          assist subordinates with deployment preparation actions, and correct and counsel subordinates who do not meet
          deployment readiness standards. NCOs are responsible for their subordinates‘ deployment readiness status.
    9.8.3. Accept responsibility for and assume the role of leader, if senior in grade. Responsibility and accountability
    increase commensurate with grade. This policy stems from time-honored military customs and traditions. Within
    enlisted grades, NCOs take rank and precedence over all junior enlisted Airmen and other NCOs according to rank.
188                                                                                   1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
      Within the same grade, date of rank, total active federal military service date, pay date, and date of birth determine
      seniority. In some circumstances, commanders may place NCOs who are lower in rank in charge of other NCOs of the
      same grade (for example, a TSgt with a date of rank of 1 April 2008 is placed in charge of a fellow TSgt with a date of
      rank of 1 April 2007). When placed in charge by commanders, these NCOs have the authority to issue lawful orders
      appropriate for mission accomplishment. Failure to obey lawful orders violates Article 92 of the UCMJ (duty status
      determines air reserve component authority).
            9.8.3.1. Know and understand Air Force Core Values, the Airman‘s Creed, and the Air Force symbol.
            9.8.3.2. Be a knowledge-enabled NCO. Stay informed on issues affecting the Air Force without bringing
            discredit to the service or compromising operational security through the use of personal communications (such
            as social media sites and emails).
            9.8.3.3. Remain keenly aware of individual and group dynamics affecting readiness and safety. Identify Airmen
            exhibiting high-risk behavior and deter further unsafe practices.
            9.8.3.4. Actively support and enforce the Air Force policy of zero tolerance for discrimination, sexual
            harassment, and sexual assault. Understand the sexual assault response coordinator‘s role and sexual assault
            reporting requirements. NCOs must maintain an environment free from behaviors that prevent others from
            achieving their full potential and maximizing their contributions (AFI 36-2706).
      9.8.4. Support and explain leaders‘ decisions.
      9.8.5. Take an active leadership and supervisory role by daily involvement with personnel. NCOs must also channel
      experience and knowledge downward to their personnel. Mentor by providing guidance and instruction to help
      subordinates develop and grow so they are prepared for increased levels of authority and responsibility and to help
      them reach their full potential.
      9.8.6. Exceed the standards and expectations levied upon their Airmen; epitomize excellence and serve as a role model
      for Airmen to emulate; lead by example by exhibiting professional behavior, military bearing, respect for authority,
      and the highest standards of dress and appearance; instill professional behaviors in their subordinates; clarify Air Force
      standards in such areas as duty performance, safety, on- and off-duty behavior, professional and unprofessional
      relationships, and personal appearance; and be alert to and immediately correct personnel who violate Air Force
      standards (AFPD 36-29; AFI 36-2406; AFI 36-2909; AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program).
      9.8.7. Provide career counseling to subordinates on benefits, entitlements, and opportunities available during an Air
      Force career, and ensure subordinates understand how to be competitive for promotion and what types of career
      opportunities exist for them. At a minimum, counseling occurs in conjunction with performance feedback counseling
      or when an individual is subject to quality review under the selective reenlistment program. At the end of the
      counseling session, review the Air Force Benefits Fact Sheet with each individual and provide it to him or her.
      9.8.8. Promote a culture of flexible Airmen who are capable of mastering multiple tasks to better support air and space
      expeditionary force mission requirements.
            9.8.8.1. Consider pursuing opportunities to retrain into Air Force shortage career fields, when appropriate, to
            balance the force and enable the Air Force to meet mission requirements, and encourage subordinates to do the
            same.
            9.8.8.2. Consider pursuing opportunities to serve in special duties, such as military training instructor, PME
            instructor, or recruiter, and encourage subordinates to do the same.
      9.8.9. Secure and promote PME and professional enhancement, for themselves and subordinates, to develop and
      cultivate leadership skills and military professionalism. In addition, secure and promote voluntary off-duty education
      opportunities for themselves and subordinates to enhance professional growth (AFI 36-2301, Developmental
      Education).
      9.8.10. Promote organizational esprit de corps and foster good community relations by supporting professional
      organizations as well as unit, base, and Air Force events, and encourage subordinates to do the same.
9.9. Specific NCO Responsibilities:
      9.9.1. SSgt.
            SSgts are primarily highly skilled technicians with supervisory and training responsibilities. They must
            continuously strive to further their development as technicians. SSgts must also strive for greater supervisory
            competence and should be given opportunities to demonstrate leadership as they develop. They are responsible
            for their subordinates and the effective accomplishment of all assigned tasks. They ensure proper and effective
AFPAM36-2241         1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                          189

            use of all personnel and materiel under their control. SSgts operate at the tactical level. The official term of
            address is Staff Sergeant or Sergeant.
      9.9.2. TSgt.
            In addition to providing sound supervision and training, TSgts are often technical experts within their specialty.
            They are responsible for the development of all assigned enlisted personnel. They must obtain maximum
            performance from each subordinate and ensure the mission is efficiently and effectively accomplished. TSgts
            must continuously strive to broaden and perfect their technical expertise and supervisory techniques. TSgts
            operate at the tactical level of leadership. The official term of address is Technical Sergeant or Sergeant.
9.10. General SNCO Responsibilities.
      In addition to meeting all NCO responsibilities, SNCOs must:
      9.10.1. Provide highly effective leadership. A SNCO‘s primary purpose in the Air Force is leading and managing
      teams to accomplish the mission.
      9.10.2. Translate leader direction into specific tasks and responsibilities their teams understand and can execute, and
      support and explain leader decisions. SNCOs should study the decisions to understand their rationale and goals so they
      can fully leverage their personal experience and knowledge to more effectively accomplish the mission.
      9.10.3. Be active, visible leaders, and develop their NCOs into better leaders and supervisors, deliberately growing and
      preparing them to be effective future SNCOs.
      9.10.4. Help leaders make informed decisions. SNCOs must draw upon their knowledge and experience to provide
      constructive input, when appropriate, to meet the challenges facing their organizations.
      9.10.5. Support company grade officers‘ continued leadership development by sharing knowledge and experience,
      when appropriate, to meet their organizations‘ challenges. Build professional relationships with company grade
      officers and strive to create the most effective leadership teams to best accomplish the mission.
      9.10.6. Exceed the standards and expectations levied upon their NCOs and Airmen. Epitomize excellence,
      professionalism, and competence, and serve as a role model for NCOs and Airmen to emulate.
      9.10.7. Ensure efficient, effective use of money, facilities, and resources to support the best interests of the Air Force,
      and plan resource utilization, replenishment, and budget allocation to ensure personnel have the equipment and
      resources needed to effectively accomplish the mission.
      9.10.8. Promote a culture of flexible Airmen capable of adapting to evolving Air Force requirements throughout a
      career.
            9.10.8.1. Consider, support, and encourage retraining as needed to balance the force and enable our Air Force to
            meet mission requirements.
            9.10.8.2. Consider, support, and encourage serving in special duties, such as first sergeant, military training
            instructor, recruiter, or PME instructor.
      9.10.9. Continue professional developmental through a variety of means, such as professional reading, voluntary
      career development courses, lectures, off-duty education, leadership seminars, etc. Personal professional growth never
      ends.
      9.10.10. Promote organizational esprit de corps and foster good community relations by supporting professional
      organizations as well as unit, base, and Air Force events, and encourage subordinates to do the same.
9.11. Specific SNCO Responsibilities:
      9.11.1. MSgt.
            MSgts are transitioning from technical expert and first-line supervisor to operational leader able to merge
            personnel talents, skills, and resources with other teams‘ functions to effectively accomplish the mission, while
            continuing to develop leadership and management skills. This rank carries significantly increased
            responsibilities and requires broad technical and managerial perspective. MSgt-selects should immediately
            enroll in and complete Course 12 or 14, SNCO PME Distance Learning Course, in preparation for their new
            role. MSgts normally operate at the operational level of leadership. The official term of address is Master
            Sergeant or Sergeant.
190                                                                                   1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
      9.11.2. SMSgt.
             SMSgts are key, experienced, operational leaders, skilled at merging personnel talents, skills, and resources
             with other teams‘ functions to effectively accomplish the mission. SMSgts continue to develop their leadership
             and management skills in preparation for expanded responsibilities and higher leadership positions. SMSgts
             normally operate at the operational level of leadership. The official term of address is Senior Master Sergeant or
             Sergeant.
      9.11.3. CMSgt.
             The rank of CMSgt is the highest enlisted rank in the Air Force, with the exception of the CMSAF. Since its
             inception, the CMSgt has evolved to hold a very distinctive role in the force. Superiors and subordinates alike
             rightfully place very high expectations upon those serving in this grade. CMSgts serve in key leadership roles at
             all levels in the Air Force from flight level to the Air Staff. They serve as commandants, superintendents,
             program managers, CCMs, functional managers, and career field managers. The Air Force ensures only the very
             best NCOs are promoted to this top rank. CMSgts, as senior leaders, must at all times epitomize the finest
             qualities of a military leader. CMSgts bring substantial institutional, operational, and functional experience, as
             well as strong leadership skills, to their organizations and to all assigned tasks. CMSgts must continually strive
             to further develop their leadership and management skills to prepare for future roles. As key mentors, they must
             actively develop their Airmen, NCOs, and SNCOs into enlisted leaders. CMSgts are assigned chief enlisted
             manager codes upon selection to CMSgt, able to fill any leadership or management level position, and perform
             any duties not prohibited by law or directive. CMSgts serve at the operational and strategic levels, depending on
             assignment. The official term of address is Chief Master Sergeant or Chief.
9.12. Enlisted Duty Titles.
      When properly applied, duty titles facilitate quick understanding of a person‘s role and level of responsibility. Enlisted
      duty titles are assigned based upon the scope of responsibility and the duties being performed. A consistent, standard
      approach is important to ensure the terms are meaningful. The following duty titles are the official, authorized duty
      titles in the enlisted force. The only exceptions are the special SNCO duty positions listed in AFI 36-2618 and limited
      instances when position or duties don‘t meet the criteria listed below. Authorized enlisted duty titles include:
      9.12.1. Supervisor.
             Used for Airmen and NCOs who are first-line supervisors (for example, Heavy Equipment Supervisor and Shift
             Supervisor). Airmen will not have the duty title "Supervisor" unless they are at least a SrA, an ALS graduate,
             and supervise others‘ work.
      9.12.2. Noncommissioned Officer in Charge.
             Used only for NCOs and SNCOs in charge of a workcenter or element. NCOICs typically have subordinate
             supervisors (for example, NCOIC, Installation Security; NCOIC, Outbound Assignments). NCOIC is also used
             for those whose primary duty is program or functional management (such as NCOIC, Unit Training
             Management; and NCOIC, Resource Management) even if they do not directly supervise personnel.
      9.12.3. Section Chief.
             Used for NCOs and SNCOs in charge of a section with at least two subordinate workcenters or elements (for
             example, Section Chief, Network Control Center). Section chiefs are typically SNCOs; the rank will vary
             depending upon the size of the section (number of enlisted personnel, number of workcenters, and scope of
             responsibilities).
      9.12.4. Flight Chief.
             Used for NCOs and SNCOs who are the enlisted leaders of a flight (for example, Flight Chief, Information
             Systems Flight; and Flight Chief, Operations Flight). Flight chiefs are typically SNCOs; the rank will vary
             depending upon the size of the flight (number of enlisted personnel, number of workcenters, and scope of
             responsibilities).
      9.12.5. Squadron Superintendent.
             Used for a CMSgt, and occasionally a SMSgt or MSgt, who is the enlisted leader of a squadron (for example,
             Squadron Superintendent, 100th Mission Support Squadron; and Squadron Superintendent, 1st Operational
             Support Squadron). Only SNCOs will hold the duty title of Squadron Superintendent.
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                       191

      9.12.6. Superintendent.
            Used for SNCOs in charge of group- or wing-level functions or in a squadron when having either oversight of
            functions within other squadrons or within the same squadron (for example, Aircraft Maintenance Unit
            Superintendent and Command Post Superintendent). Only SNCOs will hold the duty title of Superintendent.
      9.12.7. Manager.
            In addition to the special SNCO positions of AFCFM and MAJCOM Functional Manager (MFM), used for
            NCOs and SNCOs who are program, project, and policy managers at NAF, MAJCOM, DRU, field operating
            agency, Joint Staff, or Air Staff levels. They may or may not have personnel working for them and may be the
            enlisted leader of the branch, division, or directorate (for example, Manager, Intelligence Systems Integration;
            and Manager, Joint Operations Analysis and Planning).
      9.12.8. Chief.
            Used for CMSgts who are program, project, or policy managers at NAF, MAJCOM, DRU, field operating
            agency, Joint Staff, or Air Staff levels. They may or may not have personnel working for them and may be the
            enlisted leader of the branch, division, or directorate (for example, Chief, Air Force Enlisted Force
            Development; and Chief, Airman Assignments).
9.13. Special SNCO Positions:
      9.13.1. First Sergeant:
            9.13.1.1. Duty. The first sergeant is an expeditionary leader serving in a special duty position, rich in custom
            and tradition. The first sergeant works directly for and derives authority from the commander at home station
            and deployed locations, and serves as the commander‘s critical link within the unit for all matters concerning
            enlisted members. As depicted in Figure 9.2, a distinguishing diamond device on the chevron identifies the first
            sergeant. In today‘s rapidly deployable Air Force, the first sergeant is critical to providing the commander a
            mission-ready force to execute the unit mission. As the vital link between the commander, unit personnel, and
            support agencies, the first sergeant must ensure the force understands the commander‘s policies, goals, and
            objectives, and that support agencies are responsive to the needs of unit personnel and their families.
            Additionally, the first sergeant must remain vigilant for and move to resolve issues that, left unchecked, would
            adversely impact Airmen readiness.
            9.13.1.2. Selection Process. Based on the cumulative         Figure 9.2. First Sergeant Chevrons.
            and important responsibilities and the impact of this
            position, only the most dedicated professional SNCOs
            should be selected. Master sergeants approved to serve
            as first sergeants will serve a minimum of 3 years in this
            special duty with options to remain up to 3 more years.
            All MSgts who qualify for this demanding position will
            be considered by unit leadership and carefully screened
            by the chain of command. If approved and released by
            their career field, members may be assigned back to their
            previous duty station or receive an assignment to one of
            a variety of installations around the world depending on
            the needs of the Air Force.
            9.13.1.3. Return to Career Field. First sergeant duty is
            not considered retraining; it is intended for SNCOs to
            return to their previously held career field with the
            experience and knowledge they gained. Members will serve a finite amount of time in the first sergeant special
            duty and will normally return to their previous career field between the 3- and 6-year mark. Opportunities may
            occur later to allow a former first sergeant to return to the first sergeant special duty.
      9.13.2. Group Superintendent.
            Group superintendents are CMSgts who are the enlisted leaders at the group level. They provide leadership and
            management in organizing, equipping, and training assigned personnel to most effectively accomplish the
            organization mission. They manage and direct resource activities as well as interpret and enforce policies and
            applicable directives. They also recommend or initiate actions to improve organizational effectiveness and
            efficiency. Additionally, they resolve issues between subordinate squadrons, other groups, wing staff, and
            outside agencies as well as perform other duties as directed by the group commander.

      9.13.3. Enlisted Academy Commandants.
           Enlisted commandants are SNCOs who lead the enlisted schools and academies. There is a commandant at each
           Airman Leadership School (ALS), NCO Academy, the Air Force SNCO Academy (AFSNCOA), and the First
           Sergeants Academy. Enlisted commandants implement and enforce policies, procedures, and directives directly
           related to the accomplishment of the school‘s courses of instruction. They analyze data and provide direction
           and vision via curriculum evaluations, faculty assessment and development, student achievement criteria and
           feedback, and contact with senior leadership. Additionally, they coordinate frequent visits from high-ranking
           military and civilian leadership. The Vice Commandant, Thomas N. Barnes Center for Enlisted Education
           (BCEE), provides leadership, guidance, and direction to PME faculty support staff as well as short- and long-
           term strategic planning and policy formulation and implementation for BCEE schools.
      9.13.4. Enlisted MFM.
           Enlisted MFMs manage enlisted career fields for the MAJCOMs, and serve as MAJCOM liaisons for their
           respective AFCFMs. MFMs monitor career field health and manning within their command and elevate
           concerns to the AFCFMs. MFMs manage command training, coordinate associated issues with the MAJCOM
           staff and AFCFMs, and disseminate Air Force and career field policies and program requirements throughout
           the MAJCOM. They coordinate with the Air Force Personnel Center to distribute personnel throughout the
           MAJCOM to ensure proper command prioritization of allocated and assigned personnel resources, and they
           provide functional and subject-matter expertise to Air Education and Training Command (AETC) training
           managers who use the expertise to develop new or improve existing training programs.
      9.13.5. AFCFM.
           Enlisted AFCFMs are typically CMSgts serving on the Air Staff who are responsible for organizing and
           managing one or more enlisted career fields. Their responsibilities include establishing career field entry
           requirements, managing trained personnel requirements and manning, and developing and managing career-
           long training plan requirements and programs. They also construct viable career paths, evaluate training
           effectiveness, monitor health and manning of the career field, and provide input on personnel policies and
           programs. Additionally, they develop force management policies and programs, develop contingency planning
           policy, validate deployment requirements, and verify workforce availability. They are functional experts. They
           ensure their career fields are responsive to both current and future needs of the Air Force. They also
           communicate directly with other Air Staff offices on issues that affect their career fields, their respective
           MAJCOM enlisted career field representatives, and AETC training managers.
      9.13.6. CCM.                                                                             Figure 9.3. CCM Chevron.
           The CCM position exists at the MAJCOM, wing, and other authorized
           organizational levels. CCMs lead the enlisted force and advise commanders
           on matters that affect the enlisted force, such as proper utilization, quality of
           enlisted leadership, management and supervisor training, operations tempo,
           and quality of life. CCMs monitor compliance with Air Force standards, serve
           on advisory councils, and maintain a close relationship with the local
           community. They maintain a liaison between their commander, the enlisted
           force, and staff members, and they communicate with commanders on
           problems, concerns, morale, and attitudes of the enlisted force. They also
           ensure the enlisted force knows and understands commander policies. They
           serve as the functional manager for assigned first sergeants. CCMs wear the
           distinctive chevron shown in Figure 9.3.
AFPAM36-2241           1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                    193

Figure 9.4. CMSAF Chevron.         9.13.7. CMSAF.
                                   The idea of creating a CMSAF position surfaced as early as 1964 when the Air Force
                                   Association‘s Airman Advisory Council presented the idea. At that time, Air Force
                                   leadership rejected the proposal, fearing that such a position would undermine the formal
                                   chain of command. Purposeful action did not come until 1966 when Congressman Mendel
                                   Rivers introduced a bill that would mandate each of the Services to appoint a SNCO.
                                   Congressman Rivers became convinced that the Air Force needed to follow the example
                                   of the Marine Corps (which had created the position of Sergeant Major of the Marine
                                   Corps in 1957) and the Army (which had created the position of Sergeant Major of the
                                   Army in 1965) and appoint a senior enlisted advisor (SEA) to the Chief of Staff of the Air
                                   Force (CSAF). Although the Rivers bill never passed, the Air Force recognized the
                                   tremendous support behind the proposal. On 24 October 1966, CSAF General John P.
                                   McConnell announced the newly created position of CMSAF. In April 1967, Chief Paul
                                   W. Airey became the first to wear the unique insignia with the wreath around the star.
                                   Over the next decade, support for the office grew among senior leaders and within the
                                   enlisted force. Today, the CMSAF wears the chevron depicted in Figure 9.4. To date, 16
                                   individuals have previously served in this office. The present CMSAF, James A. Cody,
                                   took office in January 2013.

              9.13.7.1. CMSAF Paul Wesley Airey:
              9.13.7.1.1. Paul Wesley Airey enlisted in the Army Air Forces as a radio
              operator on 16 November 1942. By the height of World War II (WWII), he was
              serving as an aerial gunner aboard B-24 bombers. While in Europe, Airey and
              his crew were shot down over Vienna, Austria, captured, and held prisoner by
              the Germans from July 1944 to May 1945. During the Korean conflict, he was
              awarded the Legion of Merit for creating a means of constructing equipment
              from salvaged parts, improving corrosion control of sensitive radio and radar
              components. Following the war, Airey took the job of first sergeant, a position
              he later said was one of the most important in the Air Force. He subsequently
              served as first sergeant for six squadrons at four bases over the next 12 years
              before being appointed to the highest NCO position.
              9.13.7.1.2. Upon assuming his new responsibilities, CMSAF Airey began                     CMSAF Paul W. Airey
              tackling the problem of personnel retention, an issue he identified as one of the          April 1967 – July 1969
                                                                                                          Died: 11 March 2009
              greatest challenges he faced. The first-term reenlistment rate was the lowest it
              had been in 12 years, but Airey did not attribute the great decline to the
              unpopularity of the war in Vietnam. He felt it was the consequence of ―poor pay, numerous remote assignments,
              good civilian employment opportunities, and an inequitable promotion system.‖ He became an advisor to a
              committee to investigate and recommend a more equitable system. His efforts helped produce the Weighted
              Airman Promotion System (WAPS). WAPS was adopted in 1970, eliminating local enlisted promotion boards and
              equalizing promotion opportunities across career fields. In retirement, Airey continued to be an enlisted advocate
              and spoke to Airmen around the force. CMSAF Airey died in 2009.
                                    9.13.7.2. CMSAF Donald L. Harlow:
                                    9.13.7.2.1. Born in Waterville, Maine, Donald L. Harlow was the youngest of nine
                                    children. At age 22, after working a variety of jobs to help support his mother and pay
                                    his tuition at a private preparatory school, he was drafted into the Army Air Corps.
                                    Serving as an armament and gunnery instructor, he taught cadets to fieldstrip and
                                    reassemble their weapons and to synchronize firing guns through aircraft propellers. He
                                    transferred to the personnel career field in 1945 and advanced to the grade of staff
                                    sergeant before his February 1946 discharge from active duty. During the Korean War,
                                    Harlow was recalled to active duty, holding various positions in the personnel career
                                    field. At 16 years of service, he was promoted to CMSgt and was the personnel sergeant
                                    major for Headquarters U.S. European Command and the sergeant major for the
                                    Executive Services Division, Office of the Vice Chief of Staff.
    CMSAF Donald L. Harlow
    August 1969 – September 1971    9.13.7.2.2. As the second to take the reins, CMSAF Harlow continued to cut a path
         Died: 18 June 1997
                                    through the misunderstanding, confusion, and mistrust that surrounded the CMSAF

              position. He derived great satisfaction in helping the position grow and garner prestige. Ever vigilant, he
              campaigned for and refined the newly established WAPS, garnered continued flight pay for NCOs attending in-
              residence PME and worked toward equal per diem for enlisted and officers. During Vietnam, he directed his
              attention to where he felt it was most needed: young Airmen and their issues, including racial tension,
              assignment concerns, and promotion problems. Known for his no-nonsense approach and keen ability to listen,
              Harlow advised the CSAF on matters of true concern to the enlisted force. While many of his recommendations
              did not result in policy changes during his tenure, he planted the seeds for future change. After retiring, Chief
              Harlow was a strong lobbyist for enlisted equality. CMSAF Harlow died in 1997.
                                      9.13.7.3. CMSAF Richard D. Kisling:
                                      9.13.7.3.1. Richard D. Kisling and his 10 siblings were raised on a farm in Iowa during
                                      the Great Depression and the dust bowl years. The patriotism he developed during his
                                      childhood was called on when he was drafted into the Army‘s combat infantry in 1945
                                      during the effort to reconstitute the number of soldiers driving through France. After
                                      training and deployment times, Kisling arrived in France a month before the war in
                                      Europe ended. His unit assumed responsibility for negotiating the repatriation of
                                      displaced Soviets. From there, Kisling separated from the service for civilian life. After
                                      a few months spent missing the camaraderie, he reenlisted for a brief stint in the Army.
                                      In 1947, he joined the Army Air Forces, serving first as a clerk and later a personnel
                                      specialist. Upon his promotion to SMSgt in September 1958, he was among the first
      CMSAF Richard D. Kisling        group of Air Force enlisted members to wear the super grades of SMSgt and CMSgt.
      October 1971 – September 1973
         Died: 3 November 1985         9.13.7.3.2. Once assigned to the Pentagon, CMSAF Kisling found the enlisted force
                                       struggling through the development of a new Air Force. After talking with several base
              officials, it was determined that the Air Force needed to develop their NCOs like they did their officers. So
              Kisling placed concerns for NCO professional development in the forefront of discussion at the Pentagon. His
              persistence paid off when the first SNCOA was approved by Congress in 1972. The Academy officially opened
              its doors in January 1973; however, before the Academy opened its doors, the original plan was to restrict its
              attendance to first sergeants. In the end, Kisling won the battle of making professional development available to
              all senior NCOs. His concern for such enlisted issues as housing, pay, promotions, education and training, and
              assignments earned him the respect of his peers and the nickname, ―the GI‘s man in Washington.‖ CMSAF
              Kisling died in 1985.
              9.13.7.4. CMSAF Thomas N. Barnes:
              9.13.7.4.1. Thomas N. Barnes grew up in the war-related industries town of
              Chester, Pennsylvania. In 1949, he joined the newly created U.S. Air Force as
              an aircraft maintainer specializing in hydraulics. His first duty station found
              him at the leading edge of U.S. Air Force integration efforts, as one of the first
              African-Americans to join the unit. Barnes‘ unit was flying Korean War
              support missions. Unbeknownst to others in his squadron, a crew pal taught
              him the art of flight engineering and let him fly resupply and medical
              evacuation missions. By his tour‘s end, Barnes had gained flight engineer
              certification, accumulated 750 flight hours over enemy territory and earned the
              Air Medal. He was the first CMSAF with direct Vietnam experience and the
              first African-American to serve in the highest enlisted post of a military
              service. The CSAF consecutively extended him in 1975 and in 1976.                     CMSAF Thomas N. Barnes
                                                                                                       October 1973 – July 1977
                                                                                                        Died: 17 March 2003
              9.13.7.4.2. CMSAF Barnes‘ notable contribution came in the area that inspired
              his greatest passion and ranked among his largest challenges: working to
              ensure equality among the ranks and races. He took great pride in the part he played in bringing about the Air
              Force Social Actions Program in 1969. He labored to eliminate barriers for women and convince the Air Force
              to use them in nontraditional roles. He understood the value of continuing to educate Airmen and believed no
              one should advance in rank without PME, working to establish the service‘s firm commitment to enlisted PME.
              Recognized throughout the force for his ability to communicate with anyone, Barnes made listening to Airmen
              a priority. At the beginning of his tenure, the question most asked of Barnes was, ―What programs will you
              implement for the blacks?‖ ―The answer was ‗None‘,‖ Barnes recalls. ―I told them I work for all blue suiters.‖
              After his retirement, Barnes remained actively engaged in Air Force issues. CMSAF Barnes died in 2003.

                                     9.13.7.5. CMSAF Robert D. Gaylor:
                                     9.13.7.5.1. Growing up in Indiana, Robert D. Gaylor wanted to travel and learn a skill.
                                     He enlisted in the Air Force in 1948, a transition time for America and the military. As
                                     he arrived at basic training, President Truman issued Executive Order 9981,
                                     Establishing the President‘s Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity In
                                     the Armed Forces, calling for equality of opportunity in the United States military.
                                     Gaylor had had no experience with segregation or integration and he would witness the
                                     long journey to full integration. His first duty was as a military policeman and he
                                     excelled throughout his career, advancing to the rank of master sergeant with only 7
                                     years and 7 months of service. Serving as an instructor at basic training and the NCO
                                     Academy convinced him that special duties help prepare NCOs for greater leadership
    CMSAF Robert D. Gaylor           roles. In 1976, as a member of the Air Force Manpower and Personnel Center, Gaylor
      August 1977 – July 1979        traveled extensively, giving 275 leadership talks annually.
                                       9.13.7.5.2. CMSAF Gaylor‘s goal as the senior enlisted man was to feel the pulse of
            the enlisted force and serve as a conduit of information. He addressed low morale and the weak military public
            image head on. He educated the force on the hazards of substance abuse and continued to raise confidence and
            shift attitudes within the force. He is credited with securing a policy that allowed SrA to transport their families
            at government expense during permanent change of station (PCS) moves, a solid step toward improving quality
            of life. He educated the force in order to eliminate the stereotypes and prejudices working against equal
            opportunities for minorities and women. Finally, Gaylor promoted leadership. He traveled extensively, talking
            to Airmen about taking pride in their military careers. He believes one of the most important roles a former
            CMSAF can play is that of a link between the U.S. Air Force of the past and today‘s service. Gaylor continues
            to meet and serve Airmen, conducting more than 40 Air Force base visits each year.
            9.13.7.6. CMSAF James M. McCoy:
            9.13.7.6.1. James M. McCoy was raised in the midwest, attending high
            school in Atchison, Kansas, and college at St. Benedicts College in Atchison
            and St. Ambrose College in Davenport, Iowa. He seriously considered a
            vocation in the priesthood, but in 1951, during the height of the Korean War,
            he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force as a radar operator. When the war ended,
            the Air Force had too many operators and needed military training
            instructors (TI). McCoy volunteered and, with only 6 years of active duty
            experience, found himself in charge of five groups of TIs. He continued
            working within the PME system, serving as NCO preparatory school
            commandant and as an NCOA instructor before returning to the personnel
            training field in 1973. A year later he was selected as one of the U.S. Air   CMSAF James M. McCoy
            Force‘s 12 Outstanding Airmen of the Year. He then became Strategic Air         August 1979 – July 1981

            Command‘s first SEA. While there, McCoy was a member of the Air Force
            Management Improvement Group, chaired by CMSAF Barnes, which formed to discuss management issues and
            propose solutions. As a result, enlisted PME expanded into five phases.
            9.13.7.6.2. With the public still questioning the military involvement in Vietnam, the Air Force was
            experiencing the lowest recruiting year ever; retention rates were also dropping when CMSAF McCoy took
            office. His first challenge was to improve those numbers. In late 1979, along with former CMSAF Kisling, he
            testified before Congress that people were not reenlisting in the Air Force because they could not make ends
            meet on enlisted pay. McCoy worked with recruiters to get the right people in the Air Force and sought to
            improve the PME system from basic training to the NCO and SNCO level. During his tour as CMSAF, the
            Stripes for Exceptional Performers Program (STEP) was instituted to provide incentive and an alternate
            promotion option for enlisted members. In addition to visiting Airmen, he placed great value on being involved
            with the Pentagon staff. He expanded the list of boards and conferences where he believed the CMSAF should
            have a role. In retirement, McCoy remains at the forefront of Air Force issues, having served in leadership
            positions with Air Force professional organizations and speaking to Airmen throughout the force.

                                      9.13.7.7. CMSAF Arthur L. "Bud" Andrews:
                                      9.13.7.7.1. In January 1953, out of a sense of patriotism and a desire to grow and
                                      develop, Arthur "Bud" L. Andrews enlisted in the Air Force. During basic training, his TI
                                      asked for volunteers to serve as APs. Thinking AP meant ―air police,‖ Andrews raised
                                      his hand. As it turned out, the TI wanted area policemen. He spent the next 3 months
                                      picking up cigarette butts outside the barracks. He eventually had an opportunity to enter
                                      the military police force, where he served most of the next 14 years. In 1959, while
                                      working as an investigator, Andrews was credited with solving a murder committed by
                                      an airman second class. By 1970, Andrews served tours in Morocco, Thailand, and
                                      Vietnam; became a first sergeant; and was promoted to the rank of SMSgt. During his
                                      career he spent a decade as a first sergeant.
      CMSAF Arthur L. Andrews         9.13.7.7.2. Upon assuming his new position, CMSAF Andrews‘ top priority could be
         August 1981 – July 1983
          Died: 26 October 1996       described as getting back to basics. He believed the most vexing problems (such as terms
                                      of pay, benefits, recruitment, and retention) had been addressed and were evolving to
                                      meet Airmen‘s needs. While he continued to advise the CSAF on quality-of-life
               improvements, he began to focus on cultural change. He felt it was time for Airmen to ―think we instead of me,
               me, me.‖ He wanted people to focus on ―how we‘re supposed to dress, act, and react toward subordinates and
               superiors, and how we‘re supposed to do our jobs.‖ He challenged NCOs to ―take care of their people and to
               accomplish the mission.‖ He further suggested that NCOs look at themselves if they were dissatisfied with their
               jobs. He dispelled the days of ―leadership by stress‖ and applauded PME for creating a smarter force. Andrews
               believed the CMSAF needed to know the issues firsthand, which kept him traveling extensively around the Air
               Force. CMSAF Andrews died in 1996.
               9.13.7.8. CMSAF Sam E. Parish:
               9.13.7.8.1. Sam E. Parish was raised and educated in north Florida. In 1955,
               at age 17, he joined the Air Force as a ground weather equipment operator.
               His first assignment at Wiesbaden Air Base, Germany, brought him into an
               experimental program to cross train as a weather observer. That experiment
               led to a career. In 1960, he became the youngest 7-skill level in his career
               field and continued to excel. While the chief observer for the 7th Weather
               Squadron in Heidelberg, Germany, he was quickly promoted to SMSgt, and
               at age 31, Parish made CMSgt. He was a member of the first SNCO
               Academy class, and was selected as the Air Weather Service SEA in 1973.
               He returned to Germany in 1976 as the Consolidated Base Personnel Office
               Personnel Sergeant Major, and in 1977 became the SEA for the U.S. Air
               Forces in Europe (USAFE), where he established the USAFE First Sergeant                 CMSAF Sam E. Parish
                                                                                                        August 1983 – June 1986
               of the Year program. Parish later served as the 40th Air Division and
               Strategic Air Command SEA.
               9.13.7.8.2. CMSAF Parish tackled a range of enlisted personnel issues during his tenure. One such issue was the
               fixed-phase point for promotion to senior airman, which would promote qualified Airmen to SrA at a set point
               in their initial enlistment, allowing them a chance to be selected for SSgt during their first enlistment. He also
               obtained CSAF approval to allow flight line personnel to wear a functional badge on their uniform, which led to
               U.S. Air Force members in all specialties being able to wear functional badges identifying their career fields. He
               also obtained CSAF approval to establish the John Levitow Award for each level of PME and to implement the
               First Sergeant of the Year Program Air Force-wide. He was known as a straight shooter who did not waste time
               trying to figure out what people wanted to hear. Instead, he told them what they needed to hear. To Parish, the
               CMSAF is the most important job in the Air Force from an enlisted program perspective. In retirement, he
               continues to support Airmen by attending service functions and visiting bases throughout the Air Force.

                                   9.13.7.9. CMSAF James C. Binnicker:
                                   9.13.7.9.1. James C. Binnicker, raised in Aiken, South Carolina, joined the Civil Air
                                   Patrol in high school with aspirations of becoming a pilot. Cadet of the Year honors
                                   earned him a scholarship to attend flight school and the right to represent his state as a
                                   foreign exchange cadet in Great Britain. But, in 1957, doctors detected a high frequency
                                   hearing loss, disqualifying him from the program. To stay close to his passion, he joined
                                   the Air Force in the personal equipment, later called life support, career field. By 1964,
                                   Binnicker cross trained into air operations, planning flights for missions to Vietnam.
                                   While serving in Vietnam from 1968 to 1969, he served as NCOIC of operations for the
                                   22d Tactical Air Support Squadron, and later as a Vietnamese-speaking linguist at the
                                   Republic of Vietnam Armed Forces Language School in Saigon. While in Vietnam, he
   CMSAF James C. Binnicker        set his sights on becoming the CMSAF and, as such, being an advocate for enlisted
      July 1986 – July 1990        Airmen. He also served as a first sergeant and base sergeant major at Seymour Johnson
                                   AFB NC. In 1977, on the recommendation of CMSAF Thomas Barnes, he became the
                                   sole enlisted member of the newly established President‘s Commission on Military
             Compensation. In addition, he spent over 7 years as the SEA for the 4th Tactical Fighter Wing, 12th Air Force,
             Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), and Tactical Air Command.
            9.13.7.9.2. CMSAF Binnicker‘s first order of business was tackling the airman performance report, a system of
            ratings from 1 to 9. In an effort to more accurately differentiate between Airmen, the enlisted performance
            report was created, along with a system to provide and document performance feedback. Next, Binnicker set his
            sights on admitting MSgts to the SNCOA. He believed giving Airmen all the responsibility they could handle
            would result in attracting and retaining higher quality people in the Air Force. He also worked to give minorities
            and women more responsibilities throughout the Air Force. The CSAF recognized Binnicker as a staunch
            advocate and spokesman for enlisted issues. His commitment has not changed, and although he retired in 1994,
            he stays abreast of issues affecting the enlisted force. In addition to visiting PME classes to talk with students
            worldwide, he is president and chief executive officer for the Air Force Enlisted Foundation, Incorporated, and
            attends many enlisted forums and conferences.
            9.13.7.10. CMSAF Gary R. Pfingston:
            9.13.7.10.1. Gary R. Pfingston played minor league baseball before enlisting
            in the Air Force as an aircraft mechanic. During his first assignment as a B-52
            crew chief at Castle AFB, California, he went to work one day with a pack of
            cigarettes and $2, and did not return home for 30 days because the Cuban
            Missile Crisis sent the base into lockdown. Ten years later, Pfingston worked
            aircraft maintenance in Thailand, reconfiguring B-52s to carry conventional
            bombs in what became known as ―iron belly‖ modifications. In 1973, he
            returned to the states and spent the next 8 1/2 years as a military TI, and later,
            chief of the military training division. During an assignment to Andersen
            AFB, Guam, Pfingston broke his back, was hospitalized for 147 days, and
            returned to duty as the first sergeant. Future assignments had Pfingston taking
            part in the first ability to survive and operate exercise in a chemical                CMSAF Gary R. Pfingston
            environment and serving as a SEA.                                                       August 1990 – October 1994
                                                                                                        Died: 23 June 2007
            9.13.7.10.2. CMSAF Pfingston‘s focus during his tenure was the Air Force
            drawdown and budget. Holding the highest enlisted position during Desert
            Storm, he worked to restore basic allowance for subsistence to the troops living in field conditions and
            increasing the servicemember‘s Group Life Insurance, but the toughest challenge he faced was the Air Force
            downsizing. To avoid involuntary separations, Pfingston worked to implement the Voluntary Separation
            Incentive and Special Separation Bonus Programs. His idea to provide career paths and milestones in line with
            the officer career model, led to the CFETP, three-level and seven-level technical schools for all career fields,
            and mandatory in-residence PME schools. He also found himself involved with issues such as homosexuals
            serving in the military, Air Force specialty codes (AFSC) opening up to women, assignment policies including
            the Enlisted Quarterly Assignments Listing (EQUAL) and EQUAL-Plus, and even the introduction of the new
            senior NCO stripes. Pfingston remained active in what he called the ―communication chain‖ of former CMSAFs
            advocating for the enlisted force after his retirement. CMSAF Pfingston died in 2007.

                                       9.13.7.11. CMSAF David J. Campanale:
                                       9.13.7.11.1. Worcester, Massachusetts, native David J. Campanale said he had the
                                       world by the throat after high school. A promising athlete, when a baseball career fell
                                       through, his mother encouraged him to join the Air Force in 1970. Campanale
                                       completed aircraft maintenance technical school despite poor study habits and breaking
                                       his collarbone playing football. He credits his supervisors at his first base with turning
                                       his attitude around. Campanale sought challenges, volunteering for several tours to
                                       Andersen AFB, Guam, in support of B-52 Arc Light missions in Southeast Asia. He
                                       later volunteered to transfer to aerial repair. As he rose through the ranks, Campanale
                                       earned the distinguished graduate award at both the NCOA and SNCOA and was
                                       STEP-promoted to MSgt. He later served as a SEA, a role called ―richly rewarding.‖

      CMSAF David J. Campanale         9.13.7.11.2. The year CMSAF Campanale began his tour, the military launched the new
       October 1994 – November 1996    TRICARE health program. The change introduced many questions and a great deal of
                                       anxiety. He led the charge to alleviate those feelings through education. Also, when
               Congress threatened to change the retirement system to ―High One‖ effectively reducing retirement pay,
               Campanale quickly responded. With senior leader support, Campanale stood before Congress in the successful
               fight against the proposed change. Another important recruitment and retention milestone was adoption of the
               one-plus-one dormitory standard, which gave each Airman his or her own room. Not a proponent of long
               speeches, while visiting bases he encouraged questions rather than delivering a speech, which created
               meaningful dialogue. He believes anyone can become CMSAF and offers those who want to follow in his
               footsteps this piece of advice: Be honest and keep your promise. Campanale continues to actively mentor
               Airmen serving today.
               9.13.7.12. CMSAF Eric W. Benken:
               9.13.7.12.1. Raised in Cincinnati, Ohio, after graduating high school Eric
               W. Benken moved to Houston, Texas, to join his parents. Struggling to
               find a good paying job out of the area, he joined the Air Force as an
               administrative specialist. Although first assigned to Ellington AFB TX
               (less than 25 miles from Houston), he would get his chance to travel 9
               months later, on orders to Ching Chuan Kang AB, Taiwan. During his
               tour, he deployed to South Vietnam, where he spent his 20th birthday. As
               the USAFE SEA, he facilitated the highly successful beddown of forces
               during the Bosnia Operation Joint Endeavor. He led numerous quality-of-
               life initiatives, including eliminating/remodeling a third of the USAFE
               zero-privacy dormitories, making way for the newly developed one-plus-
               one dormitories. During his assignment, Benken crafted the NCO
                                                                                                    CMSAF Eric W. Benken
               Professional Development Seminar, an effort to fill the career education             November 1996 – August1999
               void between ALS and the NCOA.
               9.13.7.12.2. During his tenure as CMSAF, he focused heavily on
               fundamental discipline, getting back to basics, and changing the culture of the Air Force to meet new
               expeditionary requirements. He championed Warrior Week at basic training and ensured funding for a
               simulated deployed location at Lackland AFB TX. He instituted changes in the First Sergeant Academy
               curriculum, focusing on deployment responsibilities. He believed changing the title ―senior enlisted advisor‖ to
               ―command chief master sergeant‖ and adding the star to the chevron were critical to the success of these
               positions, in garrison and on the battlefield. CMSAF Benken engaged Congress and special interest groups on
               numerous fronts, ultimately defeating attempts to alter basic military training (BMT) gender-integrated training,
               and reversing the diminished retirement system of 1986. Other significant challenges included ensuring
               TRICARE met health care needs, and modernizing the force with a limited budget. He believed Air Force
               leaders should focus on the future and take steps to prepare the force for the next century. Benken served as the
               first co-chair of the Air Force Retiree Council, currently serves on the board of directors for the Airmen
               Memorial Foundation and the Mission Readiness Organization Executive Advisory Council, and continues to
               speak at a variety of Air Force functions.

                                  9.13.7.13. CMSAF Jim Finch:
                                  9.13.7.13.1. Jim Finch entered the Air Force from East Hampton, New York, expecting to
                                  do only a 4-year hitch. He planned to learn a trade and see what the world had to offer and
                                  move on. Finch spent the early part of his career in the ―bomb dumps‖ as a missile
                                  maintenance crew chief before becoming a PME instructor. After 4 years of teaching,
                                  Finch moved to the Leadership and Management Development Center at Maxwell AFB
                                  AL. While there, he helped develop a correspondence version of the NCO preparatory
                                  course, and taught new PME instructors. He was subsequently selected as the Air Force
                                  NCO PME functional manager at the Air Force Military Personnel Center. While there, he
                                  was involved in restructuring the PME program from four to three levels and
                                  implementing procedures to create ALS and allow MSgts to attend the SNCOA. Finch
                                  later served as an NCO Academy commandant, the 11th Air Force SEA, and Air Combat
   CMSAF Frederick J. Finch
     August 1999 – June 2002
                                  Command CCM.
                                  9.13.7.13.2. When CMSAF Finch took the reins, the Air Force was moving from a cold
                                  war to an expeditionary mindset. He implemented CMSAF Benken‘s basic training
             Warrior Week vision to help new recruits understand that the expeditionary air force was not a temporary
             concept. He credits the program‘s success to the men and women at Lackland AFB, Texas. Finch also
             streamlined the CCM selection process. The changes created a manageable pool of candidates and gave
             commanders more selection flexibility. Known as a man of vision, he spent 3 years focusing on enlisted
             members‘ concerns, and implementing programs to improve future preparedness. Finch recognized that the
             armed forces had to change to meet changing threats to national security. He believed future-focused leaders
             were paramount to success and made significant contributions to ensure the force developed that kind of leader.
             Finch maintains his vision for Airmen by serving on boards of Air Force-associated organizations, visiting Air
             Force members worldwide, and supporting current CMSAF agendas.
             9.13.7.14. CMSAF Gerald R. Murray:
             9.13.7.14.1. Gerald R. Murray, a native of Boiling Springs, North Carolina,
             grew up on his grandfather‘s farm. Graduating high school in 1974, he briefly
             attended college, married his school sweetheart, and worked in textile mills
             and construction before entering the Air Force as an F-4 aircraft crew chief in
             1977. Murray‘s performance and capabilities were quickly recognized by his
             promotion to SrA below the zone, and selection as an F-16 aircraft
             maintenance instructor. He continued to excel as the senior F-16 crew chief on
             "Victor Alert" at Incirlik AB, Turkey, and later as an A-10 squadron
             production superintendent. Deployed in support of Operations Desert Shield
             and Desert Storm, he played a key role as the combat turn director at the most
             forward operation location in theater, garnering the Bronze Star, and later the   CMSAF Gerald R. Murray
                                                                                                  July 2002 – June 2006
             Air Force General Lew Allen Trophy. After standing up a new A-10 squadron
             at Moody AFB GA, Murray‘s performance and leadership were recognized
             again when he was pulled from the flight line to serve as the 347th Wing SEA and CCM. He later served as the
             CCM at 5th Air Force, U.S. Forces Japan, and PACAF.
             9.13.7.14.2. An evolving expeditionary air force and a changed world after the 11 September 2001 terrorist
             attacks were catalysts for change during Murray‘s tenure. Murray refocused BMT and PME toward
             expeditionary combat principles and took a leading role in developing a new physical fitness program to
             improve Air Force-wide capabilities and readiness. Additionally, Murray led efforts to balance the enlisted
             force structure by increasing high-year tenure for four enlisted grades, bringing back the career job reservation
             and NCO retraining programs, and redistributing senior NCO promotions in critical and unbalanced AFSCs.
             Understanding the need to maintain strong leadership, he initiated a deliberate approach to NCO professional
             development; led changes to the management of CMSgts, including alignment under the Air Force Senior
             Leaders Management Office, and added a CMSgt‘s leadership course to the enlisted PME continuum. In
             retirement, Murray remains active in shaping Airmen development, serving with Air Force professional
             organizations and continuing to speak throughout the force.

                                 9.13.7.15. CMSAF Rodney J. McKinley:
                                 9.13.7.15.1. Rodney J. McKinley grew up in Mt. Orab, Ohio, and originally entered the Air
                                 Force in 1974 as a medical technician. He separated from the Air Force in 1977 to pursue
                                 his education. He returned to active duty in 1982 as an aircraft maintenance specialist and
                                 served in various aircraft maintenance positions at Myrtle Beach AFB SC, and Clark AB,
                                 Philippines. In 1991, he became a first sergeant, a position he held for the next 10 years,
                                 with assignments at Myrtle Beach AFB SC; Ghedi AB, Italy; Tinker AFB OK; and
                                 Ramstein AB, Germany. Chief McKinley then served as a CCM at Ramstein AB,
                                 Germany; Langley AFB VA; and 11th Air Force at Elmendorf AFB AK. In February 2003,
                                 during the early days of Operation Iraqi Freedom, he deployed as CCM to the 379th Air
                                 Expeditionary Wing, Southwest Asia. Before being selected as the 15th CMSAF, he was
                                 the PACAF CCM at Hickam AFB HI.
  CMSAF Rodney J. McKinley
      June 2006 – June 2009        9.13.7.15.2. During his tenure, CMSAF McKinley was an advocate for winning the Global
                                   War on Terrorism, developing and taking care of Airmen, and modernizing aging air,
                                   space, and cyberspace assets. CMSAF McKinley focused on properly organizing, training,
             and equipping Airmen during a time when many were being tasked outside their core competencies. His efforts
             to improve the enlisted evaluation system resulted in the first major changes to feedback and performance report
             forms since 1990. CMSAF McKinley also advocated for an educated enlisted corps and strongly encouraged
             Airmen to pursue their Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) degree earlier in their careers. A strong
             advocate for the ―American Airman‖ spirit, he opened the door for creation of the Airman‘s Creed, which
             codified core Air Force beliefs and articulated the warrior ethos. His vision led as well to creation of the
             Enlisted Heroes Walk on the parade field at Lackland AFB TX, and the return of the enlisted collar brass and
             Good Conduct Medal. CMSAF McKinley also pursued improvements in Airman health and fitness, wounded
             warrior care, child care, spousal employment opportunities, and accompanied and unaccompanied housing.
             9.13.7.16. CMSAF James A. Roy:
             9.13.7.16.1. James A. Roy grew up in Monroe, Michigan, and originally
             entered the Air Force in 1982 as a heavy equipment operator. He served in
             various civil engineer positions at MacDill AFB FL; Osan AB, Republic of
             Korea; Kunsan AB, Korea; Andersen AFB, Guam; and Keesler AFB MS. He
             returned to the site of his original technical training—Fort Leonard Wood
             MO—as an instructor and instructor supervisor. As a SMSgt, he transferred
             into personnel as the military personnel flight superintendent, Keesler AFB
             MS, in 1999. From there, Chief Roy served as a CCM at wing, NAF, and
             unified combatant command levels. These assignments included Columbus
             AFB MS; Charleston AFB SC; Langley AFB VA; and 5th Air Force and U.S.
             Forces Japan, at Yokota AB, Japan. In October 2004, he deployed as the
             386th Air Expeditionary Wing, Southwest Asia CCM. He then served as the
             U.S. Pacific Command senior enlisted leader at Camp H.M. Smith HI.                     CMSAF James A. Roy
                                                                                                     June 2009 – January 2013
             9.13.7.16.2. Chief Roy‘s key focus areas included ensuring Airmen were
             ready for joint and coalition operations; deliberately developing Airmen
             through education, training and experience; and building a culture of
             resiliency within Airmen and their families. He worked to expand and solidify training and engagement in joint
             and coalition environments, which helped enhance the employability of Airmen in the increasingly joint and
             coalition warfighting environment. He also stressed the importance of updating and expanding distance-learning
             opportunities, and developed and promoted the EPME-Next construct, designed to close the gap in PME
             following ALS.

9.14. Airmanship Defined.
      9.14.1. The Army has soldiers. The Navy has sailors. The Marine Corps has marines. The Air Force has Airmen. From
      the airman basic to the four-star general, we in the Air Force are all Airmen. As Airmen, we are part of a professional
      subculture and we demonstrate various disciplines in defense of our Nation through something we call airmanship.
      Airmanship is the mindset, evident in our behaviors, that causes us to proudly exhibit the highest levels of professional
      service to our country.
      9.14.2. What exactly is this mindset? The dictionary defines mindset as ―a mental disposition or attitude that
      predetermines one‘s responses and interpretations of situations.‖ In the case of airmanship, that mental disposition or
      attitude (mindset) is what we think and how we feel about membership in the profession of arms, and that mindset is
      reflected in our behavior. A genuine belief in and commitment to the oath of enlistment, an embracement of Air
      Force core values as your own, and a contagious willingness to fulfill all NCO responsibilities are the hallmarks of
      that mindset. Such a mindset produces pride, selfless service, and care for our country. It is this mindset that we aspire
      to create and sustain in order to perpetuate behaviors necessary for mission accomplishment.
      9.14.3. Our behavior is a direct result of our mindset (belief, commitment, embracement, and willingness), and
      demonstrates our personal commitment to membership in the profession of arms. Adherence to and enforcement of
      standards, impeccable wear of the uniform, readiness to perform mission objectives, and perpetuation of the Air Force
      culture provide a clear picture of what we expect Airman behavior to look like.
      9.14.4. Airmanship is the combination of symbols, values, and behavior patterns that make up our unique culture.
      Reflect on the definition of airmanship and evaluate your mindset behaviors to determine if you proudly exhibit the
      highest levels of professionalism in service to our country (Table 9.1).

9.15. We Are All Recruiters (WEAR) and Recruiters Assistance Programs (RAP):
      9.15.1. The We Are All Recruiters (WEAR) Program grants individuals permissive temporary duty (TDY) status if
      they are participating in an event that will directly help Air Force Recruiting Service (AFRS) efforts. Whether visiting
      schools, volunteering to help an actual recruiter, or talking to various people about the Air Force, all service members
      can contribute to the recruiting mission. WEAR was created to augment limited recruiting resources and stretch
      limited advertising dollars. A WEAR event is an event where the interaction of Air Force personnel educates and
      increases public awareness of the Air Force and could potentially provide numerous leads for recruiters. A request to

      participate in the WEAR Program must be approved by the individual‘s commander according to AFI 36-3003,
      Military Leave Program. Requests are then routed through AFRS Public Affairs to the AFRS commander. Members
      may be granted up to 12 days permissive TDY to attend approved WEAR events. For more information, see AFI 36-
      3003.
      9.15.2. The Recruiter Assistance Program (RAP) is an active-duty leave program run by AFRS. The Air Force grants
      up to 12 days of nonchargeable leave, including one weekend, in accordance with AFI 36-3003. RAP is open to
      Airmen of all ranks interested in participating and having a positive impact on recruiting. RAP is beneficial to the Air
      Force and to participants because Airmen can be a major influence in bringing the Air Force story to their hometown
      or place of previous residence by helping recruiters make contacts and develop leads. RAP duties may include
      participation in question-and-answer sessions, making presentations, or providing testimonials of their Air Force
      experiences to high school and college students. For more information about RAP, see AFI 36-3003.

Section 9C—Enlisted Professional Military Education (EPME)
9.16. U.S. Air Force Enlisted Professional Military Education (EPME).
      Air Force EPME complements training, experience, and other educational programs to provide enlisted leaders a
      continuum of learning via progressive courses concentrated on developing airmanship and war-fighting skills. EPME
      courses provide professional education to enlisted Airmen at specific and critical career points, and thus play a vital
      role in preparing them for increased supervision, leadership, and management challenges. More specifically, enlisted
      PME develops Air Force institutional competencies and subcompetencies vital to the knowledge and skills required for
      sound decisionmaking and ultimately strategic thinking to provide the Air Force with agile combat support. The three
      levels of Air Force EPME are ALS, NCOA, and the AFSNCOA. All three levels of EPME are delivered at resident
      schools and are also available via distance learning (DL) courses. EPME provides career-long learning opportunities to
      prepare enlisted members for positions of greater responsibility and to increase their commitment to the military
      profession. More than 40,000 enlisted Airmen complete EPME courses each year. For more information about Air
      Force EPME programs and policies, see AFI 36-2301.
      9.16.1. Thomas N. Barnes Center, EPME Academic Affairs (AA).
            The Thomas N. Barnes Center for Enlisted Education (BCEE), EPME AA is located at Maxwell AFB-Gunter
            Annex AL. AA provides EPME program development, faculty development, and operational program
            management for three resident and three DL courses. AA also conducts studies and advises Air Force and other
            key leaders on numerous issues and policies pertaining to Air Force and joint EPME matters. They can be
            reached via the BCEE home page at http://www.au.af.mil/au/barnes.
            9.16.1.1. Mission, Vision, and Goal. The AA mission is to provide the continuum of EPME necessary to
            inspire and develop enlisted leaders with the moral framework of integrity, service, and excellence. The AA
            vision is to instill Airmen with a warrior ethos, an expeditionary mindset, and a passion for leading in the cause
            of freedom. Finally, the goal of AA is to expand the leadership ability of enlisted leaders and strengthen their
            commitment to the profession of arms by integrating sound leadership, communication skills, and military
            studies, principles, and concepts through the EPME curricula.
            9.16.1.2. Curriculum. EPME AA provides comprehensive programs (curricula, evaluation, analysis, instructor
            development) for each level of EPME. These programs consist of thorough and rigorous academic courses that
            use performance evaluations and objective examinations to determine how well students achieve instructional
            objectives. EPME courses are based on three broad areas of learning/graduate attributes: military professional,
            expeditionary leadership, and leadership communication. The principle methods of instruction are guided
            discussion, case study analysis, and experiential learning.
            9.16.1.3. Academic Credit. Airmen receive academic credit for completing EPME courses through the CCAF,
            accredited through the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. EPME schools provide the CCAF with
            class graduate data, and the CCAF automatically updates individual records and transcripts.
      9.16.2. EPME Resident Courses:
            9.16.2.1. ALS. The ALS is the first level of EPME that enlisted Airmen complete as they progress through their
            Air Force careers. On 1 October 1991, Air University established a standardized ALS program that replaced the
            NCO Preparatory Course and the NCO Leadership School. ALSs operate at almost every installation across the
            Air Force.
            9.16.2.1.1. Mission and Goals. The ALS mission is to prepare senior airmen (SrA) to be professional, war-
            fighting Airmen able to supervise and lead Air Force teams to support the employment of air, space, and
AFPAM36-2241    1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                        203

         cyberspace power. The goal is for SrA to understand expectations inherent in their position and the need for
         professional development in order to become effective NCOs. Completion of ALS in residence is required to
         perform duties as a reporting official and to be eligible for promotion to SSgt.
         9.16.2.1.2. Curriculum. ALS is a 5-week course with a curriculum designed to develop a mindset and
         associated skills to meet four core graduate attributes: (1) expeditionary Airman, (2) supervisor of Airmen, (3)
         military professional, and (4) supervisory communicator. ALS graduates earn 10 semester hours of college
         credit with CCAF.
         9.16.2.2. NCOA. In November 1993, operational control of stateside NCOAs transferred from the various
         MAJCOMs to AETC. AETC assigned all stateside NCOAs to the College for EPME (now the BCEE). In
         addition to the five Barnes Center-operated academies, the Air National Guard operates one NCOA, PACAF
         operates three, and United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) operates one.
         9.16.2.2.1. Mission and Goals. The NCOA mission is to prepare TSgts to be professional, war-fighting Airmen
         who can lead and manage Air Force units in the employment of air, space, and cyberspace power. The goal is
         for TSgts to understand their position in the military structure and develop the skills necessary to be effective
         supervisors and leaders. Resident NCOA completion is required within 2 years of sewing on TSgt and to be
         eligible for promotion to MSgt.
         9.16.2.2.2. Curriculum. NCOA is a 6-week course with a curriculum designed to develop a mindset and
         associated skills to meet four core professional NCO attributes: (1) military professional, (2) operational
         Airman, (3) unit manager, and (4) managerial communicator. NCOA graduates earn 11 semester hours of
         college credit with CCAF.
         9.16.2.3. AFSNCOA. The Air Force established the AFSNCOA in 1972 to enhance development of SNCOs
         through PME. In January 1973, the AFSNCOA conducted its first class of 120 SNCOs at Maxwell AFB-Gunter
         Annex AL. Presently, the AFSNCOA trains up to 2,250 Air Force SNCOs, (SMSgts, SMSgt selects, and
         selected MSgts), Navy and Coast Guard chief petty officers, Army and Marine sergeants major, and
         international SNCOs annually.
         9.16.2.3.1. Mission and Goals. The AFSNCOA mission is to prepare senior NCOs to lead the enlisted force in
         the employment of air, space, and cyberspace power in support of national security objectives. The AFSNCOA
         vision is to equip today‘s senor enlisted leaders to be tomorrow‘s expeditionary warriors. AFSNCOA in
         residence is required for promotion to SMSgt.
         9.16.2.3.2. Curriculum. The AFSNCOA is a 7-week course that focuses on four key attributes: (1) military
         professional, (2) operational manager, (3) joint warfighter, and (4) senior communicator. For 3 days, the
         AFSNCOA students team up with Squadron Officer School students to improve officer and enlisted interaction
         within the PME environment and increase understanding and appreciation of the talents that each brings to the
         projection of airpower. AFSNCOA graduates earn 13 semester hours of college credit with CCAF.
    9.16.3. EPME DL Courses.
         Students completing EPME DL courses gain additional knowledge about their increasing responsibilities as
         leaders and managers described in AFI 36-2618. EPME DL course policies are available on the education and

            graduates earn 4 CCAF semester hours of college credit.
9.17. Senior Enlisted Joint Professional Military Education (SEJPME).
      Operating in joint, interagency, multinational, and coalition war-fighting organizations requires all enlisted personnel
      to learn joint concepts. Enlisted personnel learn joint concepts at each EPME level to improve their ability to operate
      effectively as part of the joint force and to meet joint force needs. The SEJPME course provides SNCOs a more
      comprehensive joint education to prepare them for assignments to joint billets at the senior enlisted leader or command
      senior enlisted leader level.
      9.17.1. Mission and Goals.
            The SEJPME course is a Web-based course that educates senior enlisted leaders assigned to or slated to serve in
            joint organizations. The course is designed to expose enlisted personnel to joint education, prepare them to
            succeed by improving their ability to operate effectively as part of a future joint force, and prepare them to
            supervise multiple Service members. The SEJME course is open to active duty, Reserve, and Guard personnel
            in grades E-6 through E-9. The SEJPME course is offered entirely on line and is accessible from anywhere at
            any time via the internet. Note: Students should complete rank-required service EPME before enrolling in this
            course.
      9.17.2. Curriculum.
            The SEJPME course consists of a pretest, five learning modules of various lengths totaling 40 hours, section
            quizzes, and a final exam. Because the course is self-paced, how long a student takes to complete it depends on
            a student‘s schedule and personal commitment. For more information or to enroll, go to
            http://www.jfsc.ndu.edu/schools_programs/se_jpme/default.asp.

Section 9D—Military Ethics
9.18. Introduction.
      Military ethics is about what is good and true, and having the courage to do and be what and who we ought to be.
      Military ethics is not about personal successes or failures, or virtues or vices. Military ethics is about our heritage and
      history, and our responsibility to be men and women of character.
      9.18.1. According to Dr. James H. Toner, former Professor of International Relations and Military Ethics, Air War
      College, military ethics is rooted in the three Os: owing, ordering, and oughting.
      9.18.2. Military ethics cannot properly exist without the concept of owing. If we, as Airmen, know why we owe, we
      are able to recognize the obligation, responsibility, and duty which give rise to moral thinking and ethical reasoning.
      Airmen must understand that they owe a debt of gratitude to country, family, service, chain of command, and
      comrades. That is what the core value ―service before self‖ means, and is reflected in this line from the Airman‘s
      Creed: I am faithful to a proud heritage, a tradition of honor, and a legacy of valor.
      9.18.3. The second O is for ordering, or what Toner calls moral structuring and ethical priorities. In other words, are
      you putting your priorities in the right order? Many illegal activities or stupid mistakes are the result of a leader‘s
      failure to order wisely and well. As enlisted personnel, we take an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States,
      and to obey the President and the officers appointed over us, in that order. As Airmen, our highest priority is to serve
      our country. We can never sacrifice the good of our Nation for the good of our Service, our superiors, or ourselves.
      According to Toner, the proper ordering of our priorities should be country, Air Force, unit. Toner points out that all
      we need to do to understand this concept is to look at the Service tapes on our uniforms and notice that U.S. always
      comes before Air Force.
      9.18.4. The final O, oughting, is the understanding of what Airmen ought to do every day. What Airmen do may not
      be what they ought to do. It may sound simple, but military hierarchies insist upon obedience to orders and total
      discipline. Ethics, however, demurs, insisting upon conditional and contextual obedience to orders, which ought to be
      obeyed, if lawful. Integrity is always a good guide to help us determine what we ought to do when faced with ethical
      dilemmas.
      9.18.5. As Airmen, we owe those who wore the uniform before us. We are free today because others sacrificed their
      time, effort, and lives to make our country what it is, and we must continue the fight to ensure our country stays strong
      and secure. We must also order our priorities so we are able to overcome any temptation to stray from our military
      norms and values. Finally, we should always do what we ought to do.
AFPAM36-2241          1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                        205

      9.18.6. Military ethics is not about others. It is about you knowing what is true and doing what is right; about being the
      man or woman who leads the kind of life you can be proud of.

Section 9E—Enlisted Force Development
9.19. Introduction.
      Enlisted Force Development (EFD) is a life-cycle approach to developing innovative Airmen prepared to accomplish
      the Air Force mission and lead in a rapidly evolving global environment while attempting to meet both personal and
      professional needs. Deliberate development is essential throughout an Airman‘s career and is satisfied through
      education on institutional competencies, training on functional competencies, a varied array of experiences, and
      developmental tools. The most important issue when it comes to developing Airmen is to ensure they are taking full
      advantage of the abundant opportunities that exist both functionally and institutionally. From an enterprise
      perspective, it is imperative to look at how an Airmen progresses through their career field and then into operational
      and strategic leadership positions.
      9.19.1. Functionally, the Air Force develops technical experts through career field progression planning. From the
      earliest stages of their careers, Airmen and their supervisors must comprehend the progression path for technical and
      tactical development. In the majority of career fields, the progression roadmap and pyramid provide sufficient
      direction to produce Airmen qualified for their current duties and for future responsibilities. It is incumbent upon
      career field managers to routinely review their progression strategy to ensure the career field‘s technical requirements
      are being satisfied.
      9.19.2. Institutionally, we develop experienced leaders. As Airmen demonstrate expertise and potential, they should
      be encouraged to take on more responsibility and increased leadership roles. Experience opportunities such as
      deployments, joint assignments and headquarters staff assignments offer a unique perspective on how the Air Force
      functions. Furthermore, special duty assignments provide skills and insight beneficial to an Airman‘s future
      capabilities.
      9.19.3. Additionally, educational opportunities exist throughout an Airman‘s career which contributes to individual
      overall development. Enlisted Professional Military Education, developmental education, civilian education and other
      self improvement programs (such as the CSAF Professional Reading Program) enhance the knowledge and
      capabilities of Airmen.
      9.19.4. Effective career progression and Airman development is dependent on continuous conversations between
      supervisors and subordinates regarding career field and institutional requirements; personal qualifications and goals;
      and available developmental opportunities. Routine counseling and performance feedback sessions should include
      these discussions.
9.20. Enlisted Force Development Oversight:
      9.20.1. The Enlisted Force Development Panel (EFDP).
             The EFDP is responsible for guiding enlisted force development efforts. The EFDP is charged to review,
             evaluate, and make recommendations to senior Air Force leaders regarding concerns, programs and initiatives
             relating to the education, training and experiences impacting enlisted Airman development. The EFDP is co-
             chaired by the Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force and the Director, Force Development (AF/A1D). Panel
             members include Command Chief Master Sergeants from the Combatant Command and Major Command
             level as well as Chief Master Sergeants from the Air Force Reserve Command and the Air National Guard.
             Additionally, there are Career Field Managers and representatives from Air Education Training Command, Air
             University, Second Air Force, Basic Military Training and Headquarters Air Force. A former Chief Master
             Sergeant of the Air Force attends as a strategic advisor.
9.21. Enlisted Force Development Tools:
      9.21.1. Enlisted Development Teams (EDTs).
             The EFDP recommended initiating EDTs in 2010. In 2011, pilot EDTs were conducted in eight career field
             specialties. In August 2012, AF/A1 and the Vice Chief of Staff approved EDTs for all AFSCs. EDTs ensure
             senior leadership becomes familiar with the people assigned to their functional area, making assessments of
             their qualifications for future opportunities. EDTs are used by career fields to perform succession planning in
             order to identify personnel eligible for critical leadership and developmental positions based on defined
             education, training, experience and performance requirements.

      9.21.2. My Enlisted Development Plan (MyEDP).
             MyEDP is a Web-based resource which provides a streamlined, self-service approach to enable enlisted
             Airmen to manage their professional development. MyEDP allows Airmen to view information and data
             related to their specific career field, as well as track and plan their individual career paths, stay informed,
             collaborate with peers, and track their professional progression. Through My EDP, Airmen can access
             information through a common interface that was once available only by accessing many separate systems.
             Additionally, special features include mentoring capabilities, discussion forums, and tools for Airmen to track
             their personal and professional accomplishments.
      9.21.3. Strategic Visual Mapping Tool.
             The Enlisted Force Development Strategic Visual Mapping Tool is an interactive tool designed to help senior
             Air Force leaders gain insight and understanding of the Enlisted Force Development enterprise and specific
             aspects of training, education, and experience. The combination of graphical representations and program data
             will facilitate senior leader communication and transparency. Various stakeholders will be able to use this tool
             to make informed decisions impacting the future of the enlisted force. In addition, the tool contains a
             ―worldview‖ map (Figure 9.5.) of enlisted force development which includes rank tiers, leadership levels,
             strategic guidance, force development goals and other pertinent force development information.

      9.21.4. Enlisted Career Path Pyramid.
            The Enlisted Career Pyramid (Figure 9.6) is a display of training education, and experience which enlisted
            Airmen will encounter throughout their career. It provides Airmen with an understanding of current and future
            opportunities for continuing development.

9.22. Institutional Competencies.
      Prepare Airmen to operate successfully across the widest array of Air Force tasks and requirements. These
      competencies provide a common language and a set of priorities for consistency across the Air Force. The Air Force‗s
      institutional competencies are key to ensuring the ability of Airmen to operate successfully in a constantly changing
      operational environment. They are broadly applicable and span all occupations, functions, and organizational levels.
      These competencies place the institutional responsibilities into a context of how the individual should be developed
      and form the framework for force development in the Air Force. The institutional competency list consists of 8
      competencies and 24 sub-competencies. They are grouped into three categories: personal, people/team, and
      organizational.
      9.22.1. Personal Competencies.
            Personal competencies (Figure 9.7) are those institutional competencies leaders need in face-to-face and
            interpersonal relationships that directly influence human behavior and values. These are foundational
            institutional competencies learned at the tactical level that will continue to play a critical role as leaders move to
            the operational competence 54 and strategic vision levels. Personal competencies are essential for individual
            contribution, for building cohesive units and for empowering immediate subordinates. Each competency below
            is followed by the relevant subcompetencies that define it.

       9.22.2. People/Team Competencies.
             This group of competencies (Figure 9.8) involves more interpersonal and team relationships. They represent
             competencies that, when combined with the personal competencies, are essential as leaders move on to lead
             larger groups or organizations. People/team leadership competencies are usually exercised more indirectly than
             personal leadership competencies. Leaders use these competencies to set the organizational climate. Each
             competency below is followed by the relevant subcompetencies that define it.
       9.22.3. Organizational Competencies.
             These competencies (Figure 9.9) represent those applicable at all levels of the Air Force but are most in demand
             at the strategic level. Strategic leaders apply organizational competencies to establish structure and articulate
             strategic vision. Effective organizational competency skills include technical competence on force structure and
             integration; on unified, joint, multinational, and interagency operations; on resource allocation; and on
             management of complex systems. In addition, they apply to conceptual competence in creating policy and
             vision and interpersonal skills emphasizing consensus building and influencing peers and other policy makers,
             both internal and external to the organization. This level is the nexus of warfighting leadership skills for the Air
             Force. It is achieved through having learned the lessons from the other types of institutional competencies (i.e.,
             personal and people/team). Each competency below is followed by the relevant subcompetencies that define it.

Section 9F—The Profession of Arms: An Airman’s Perspective
9.23. America’s Guardians:
      9.23.1. Since the Nation‘s birth, it has been the constitutional duty of our military to ensure national survival, defend
      lives and property, and promote vital interest at home and abroad. To provide for the common defense, all of
      America‘s military services strive for excellence in how they organize, train, and equip their forces to fight and win the
      Nation‘s wars. All are vital, interdependent components of a mighty joint team, united by a tradition of honor, valor,
      and devotion.
      9.23.2. The Air Force exists to fly, fight, and win to achieve strategic, operational, and tactical objectives unhindered
      by time, distance, or geography. The Air Force‘s mission is to ―deliver sovereign options for the defense of the United
      States of America and its global interests—to fly and fight in Air, Space, and Cyberspace.‖ Thereby, jointly with our
      brothers and sisters in arms—soldiers, sailors, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen—we underwrite the strategy of
      defending the homeland and assuring allies, while dissuading, deterring, and defeating enemies.
9.24. Professionalism or Profession of Arms.
      No profession asks more of its members than the Profession of Arms. We are warriors, we have answered our Nation‘s
      call; no one puts more on the line to defend freedom than the men and women of the United States Armed Forces.
             As members of the joint team, we Airmen are part of a unique profession that is founded on the
             premise of service before self. We are not engaged in just another job; we are practitioners of the
             profession of arms. We are entrusted with the security of our Nation, the protection of our citizens, and
             the preservation of its way of life. In this capacity, we serve as guardians of America‘s future. By its
             very nature, this responsibility requires us to place the needs of our service and our country before
             personal concerns.
             Our military profession is sharply distinguished from others by what General Sir John Hackett has
             termed the ―unlimited liability clause.‖ Upon entering the Air Force, we accept a sacred trust from the
             American people.
             We swear to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and
             domestic. We take this obligation freely without any reservations. We thereby commit our lives in
             defense of America and her citizens should that become necessary.
             No other profession readily expects its members to lay down their lives for their friends, families, or
             freedoms. But our profession readily expects its members to willingly risk their lives in performing
             their professional duties. By voluntarily serving in the military profession, we accept unique
             responsibilities.
             Inherent in all this is the individual‘s willingness to subordinate personal interests for the good of
             one‘s unit, one‘s Service, and one‘s Nation. We can ill afford individuals who become ―sunshine
             soldiers‖ or get focused on careerism. Instead, we need professionals who strive to be the best at their
             current job and who realize they attain individual advancement through the success of their unit or
             workcenter.
                                                                         General Ronald R. Fogleman
                                                                         Former Air Force Chief of Staff
9.25. The Airman’s Perspective:
      9.25.1. Throughout our history, the Air Force has always had a perspective or mindset different than the surface
      components of national military power. It is based on a long history of lessons learned in peace and war. Specifically,
      airpower in application is fundamentally different from other forms of military power. Second, its inherent flexibility
      allows its force to be applied independently or in concert with other forms of military power. And third, it can be most
      effective if applied for the right reasons and in the right concentrations at the right time and place to achieve effects on
      the battlefield. Therefore, since Air Force forces are employed differently, in different mediums, at different speeds
      and closure rates and over greater distances, it must be applied by those who truly appreciate the breadth and scope in
      the application of that power. It is knowledge of these aspects of Air Force capabilities in which an Airman should be
      fluent.
AFPAM36-2241        1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                          213

      9.25.2. Given that Airmen are essential to the Air Force institution and to the successful execution of its mission, it is
      important to understand and actively advocate the Airman‘s perspective on the use of airpower to achieve objectives as
      directed by proper authority. All Airmen share the same goal—to accomplish their organization‘s mission. In order to
      defend the United States and its global interests, Airmen should be prepared to fly and fight in air, space, and
      cyberspace. Using the Airman‘s perspective gives Airmen a distinctive advantage when performing this mission of the
      Air Force. Airmen bring not only knowledge, skills, and abilities that allow them to accomplish this mission, but a
      manner of approaching mission accomplishment unique to those educated, trained, and experienced in bringing
      airmindedness to all actions they perform. An Airman brings a perspective to performing the Service‘s mission that
      compounds his or her effectiveness in a manner best suited to support a commander.
      9.25.3. Upon entering the Air Force, members take an oath signifying their personal commitment to support and
      defend the Constitution of the United States and a commitment and willingness to serve their country for the duration
      of their Air Force career. The oath is a solemn promise to do one‘s duty and meet one‘s responsibilities. The oath
      espouses the responsibility to lead others in the exercise of one‘s duty.
      9.25.4. Building warrior leaders who have the competencies and skills to understand the complexity of expeditionary
      operations and the successful execution of airpower capabilities in unilateral, joint, or coalition operations is a
      responsibility shared by the Air Force and individual Airmen. These Airmen must also be able to use scarce resources
      effectively to deliver required air, space, and cyberspace effects. The development of this warrior ethos is an
      individual and organizational responsibility.
      9.25.5. When Air Force forces are employed in various operational environments, they offer basic characteristics that,
      when exploited, are fundamental to the successful conduct of war and peace. These characteristics, when molded into
      viable force capabilities and executed by knowledge-enabled Airmen, enhance the overall ability of the joint team to
      achieve success when called upon. Therefore, each Airman should understand and be able to articulate the full
      potential and application of Air Force capabilities required to support the Air Force mission and meet U.S. national
      security objectives.
9.26. The Warrior Ethos:
      9.26.1. The central focus of the profession of arms is warfighting. As Airmen, we have a special responsibility to
      ensure the most lethal Air Force the world has ever seen flies and fights the right way. Airmen have inherited an Air
      Force forged through the ingenuity, courage, and strength of Airmen who preceded them. An Airman‘s duty is to
      continue to provide the Nation and the next generation of Airmen an equally dominant Air Force. Doing so requires
      Airmen to fully understand the profession of arms they have chosen, the commitment they made by taking an oath of
      office, and the acceptance to live according to the Air Force‘s core values. This is the warrior ethos. It is a mindset
      designed to build the confidence and commitment necessary to shape professional Airmen able to work as a team to
      accomplish the mission. This mindset is shaped by an expeditionary service during combat, humanitarian response,
      disaster relief operations, and by the lessons learned from those operations. It is also developed and sustained over the
      course of a career through a continuum of learning and associated development experiences, including a wide variety
      of assignments, focused training and education, exhibiting pride in the Air Force uniform, physical conditioning, and
      understanding Air Force symbols, history, and culture.
      9.26.2. Airmen share a history of service, honor, and sacrifice. From the earliest days of airpower to the heights of
      space, Airmen have built an extraordinary heritage that forms the foundation for the Service‘s boundless horizon. Even
      though we are technology focused, we value quality over quantity. We embrace change and through transformation
      and innovation ensure a viable Air Force for the future. Airmen firmly grounded in the core values and ingrained with
      the warrior ethos react to combat stresses, operational deployment pressures, and daily home station demands with
      valor, courage, and sacrifice. We all have these characteristics, which surface often during times of great difficulty or
      unforeseen circumstances. While many acts of valor, courage or sacrifice go unseen, others helped shape the finest
      traditions of the Air Force. They should be recognized not only as part of U.S. Air Force history, but also to illustrate
      that any Airman may be called upon to perform above and beyond in the profession of arms.
9.27. Valor.
      Valor is the ability to face danger or hardship in a determined and resolute manner. It is commonly known as bravery,
      fearlessness, fortitude, gallantry, heart, nerve, and many other terms. Valor is the willingness to step outside of one‘s
      comfort zone to deal with an unexpected situation. Such situations can happen almost anywhere. Valor exists in places
      other than on the battlefield; an Airman can exhibit valor when presented with unusual circumstances in the daily
      routine of life. When acting with valor, one expresses the qualities of a hero or heroine.

                 In the summer of 2005, SrA Shea Dodson wanted to do more than his assigned administrative duties inside
                 of Baghdad‘s Green Zone. The call was out for volunteers to provide security for ongoing convoys, so
                 Airman Dodson raised his hand. After some intense just-in-time training, he was performing security detail
                 for his first convoy. On this mission, Airman Dodson put that training to good use. When a suspected
                 vehicle-borne suicide bomber raced toward the convoy, he fired .50 caliber rounds into the engine block no
                 fewer than four times, disabling the vehicle. During the same mission, his unit became mired in traffic near
                 a high-rise development. He noticed movement above and saw an Iraqi armed with an AK-47 creeping
                 toward the edge of a balcony overlooking the convoy. Airman Dodson immediately engaged with indirect
                 warning fire from his M-16, hitting the wall next to the suspected insurgent‘s head. The armed Iraqi dove
                 for cover and never returned. When the convoy arrived at its final destination, a children‘s school, he
                 continued with a complete security sweep of the perimeter houses to ensure it was clear. Airman Dodson
                 remained on armed watch as his team handed out school supplies to the kids in the open courtyard. By 2
                 PM that same day, Airman Dodson was back at his desk, keeping track of critical data for the commanding
                 general of the Multinational Security Transition Command–Iraq. It was all in a day‘s work for this
                 dedicated Airman.
                                                                           Quotations from the Air Force Memorial in
                                                                           Washington, DC
                 Saving the lives of your fellow Airman is the most extraordinary kind of heroism that I know.
                                                                           General Curtis E. LeMay (b. 1906 – d. 1990)
                                                                           Former Air Force Chief of Staff
                 When I think of the enlisted force, I see dedication, determination, loyalty, and valor.
                                                                           Paul W. Airey
                                                                           (b. 1923 –d. 2009)
                                                                           First Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force
                 As I prepare for this…mission, I am a bit homesick… Mother and Dad, you are very close to me, and
                 I long so to talk to you. America has asked much of our generation, but I‘m glad to give her all I
                 have because she has given me so much.
                                                                           Sergeant Arnold Rahe, U.S. Army Air Forces, WWII
                                                                           Killed in France; from a letter to his parents
9.28. Courage.
      Courage is about the ability to face fear, danger, or adversity. Three types of courage are critical in the profession of
      arms: personal, physical, and moral. Personal courage is about doing what‘s right even at risk to one‘s career. Physical
      courage is the ability to overcome fears of bodily harm to get the job done, or willingness to risk yourself for someone
      else‘s sake in battle or the course of everyday life. Finally, moral courage is the ability to stand by the core values
      when it may not be the popular thing to do. Integrity breeds courage when and where the behavior is most needed.
      More often than not, courage is manifested as an act of bravery on the battlefield as Airmen face the challenges present
      in combat.
                 While on a special mission in Southwest Asia in 2005, TSgt Corey Clewley was loading cargo on his
                 aircraft when he saw a Romanian C-130 experience a hard landing. Unbeknownst to the Romanian crew,
                 the aircraft brakes caused a fire, causing Sergeant Clewley to spring into action. He instructed a fellow
                 loadmaster to inform his aircraft commander of the situation and to ensure that someone contacted the
                 control tower of the fire while he and a crew chief grabbed fire extinguishers and ran toward the burning
                 aircraft. The Romanian C-130 fire intensified as it spread to the aircraft‘s fuselage and ruptured the
                 hydraulic brake line. Despite the danger to himself, Sergeant Clewley got within a few feet of the flames
                 and attempted to suppress the fire. His sense of urgency tripled when he realized the C-130 crew was still
                 inside the aircraft and was unable to get out of the burning aircraft. He saw a member of the crew
                 mouthing ‗please, please‘ and pointing to the troop exit door. Sergeant Clewley refocused his attention to
                 that area and began suppressing the fire, enabling the crew to safely exit the aircraft. He continued to keep
                 the fire under control until the fire department arrived. Sergeant Clewley credits the team effort that kept
                 the incident from becoming a deadly event and never considered the risk to his own life as he worked to
                 save a crew and aircraft that was not part of his responsibility, his service, or even his Nation. He noted
                 that saving the lives of the people on board was more important than who owned the aircraft.
                                                                           Quotations from the Air Force Memorial in
                                                                           Washington, DC
AFPAM36-2241        1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                       215

9.29. Sacrifice:
      9.29.1. Sacrifice involves a willingness to give your life, time, or comfort to meet others' needs. Personal sacrifice
      occurs on many levels, but is commonly evident in the heroic actions of Airmen in combat. Day-to-day deployed
      garrison activities also present opportunities to put others' needs before individual wants.
               Everyday people can confront their fears, pains and uncertainties with courage or cower to the daily
               decisions facing them. Just being here (at Manas AB), you have overcome many challenges with
               your courage that helped prepare you to contribute to your Nation in tangible ways. You faced basic
               training, skills training, and deployment to a location worlds away from your normal life. All have
               taken courage and prepared you for the impact you are making…your decisions, your actions, your
               sacrifices of the luxuries of home, friends, and family do make a difference. Every day, the Airmen of
               Manas, from Airman Basic to Colonel, make decisions that have an impact on the Global War on
               Terrorism! Without the contributions of the individual soldier who pays the price to secure freedom
               for the many, the mission does not get done. Simply put…because Airmen have courage…because
               Airmen make sacrifices…because Airmen are not intimidated by challenges…because YOU have the
               courage to live a life of sacrifice for the ideals of a nation, the mission is accomplished day in and
               day out.
                                                                        Major James Hall, Commander, Detachment 1,
                                                                        317th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron

               They knew not the day or hour nor the manner of their passing when far from home they were called
               to join that great band of heroic Airmen that went before.

               everyone has to leave this earth one way or another, and this is the way I have selected. If after this
               terrible war is over, the world emerges a saner place…pogroms and persecutions halted, then I‘m
               glad I gave my efforts with thousands of others for such a cause.

      9.29.2. Exemplifying the Air Force core values, Senior Airman Jason Cunningham performed actions during
      Operation Enduring Freedom that earned him the thanks of a grateful Nation, but at the cost of his life:
216                                                                                   1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241

                                     CITATION TO ACCOMPANY THE AWARD OF
                                              THE AIR FORCE CROSS
                                                      (POSTHUMOUS)
                                                             TO
                                                JASON D. CUNNINGHAM
  The President of the United States of America, authorized by Title 10, Section 8742, U.S.C., awards the Air Force Cross
  to Senior Airman Jason D. Cunningham for extraordinary heroism in military operations against an opposing armed
  force while serving as a pararescueman near the village of Marzak in the Paktia Province of Afghanistan on 4 March
  2002. On that proud day, Airman Cunningham was the primary Air Force Combat Search and Rescue medic assigned to
  a Quick Reaction Force tasked to recover two American servicemen evading capture in austere terrain occupied by
  massed Al Qaida and Taliban forces. Shortly before landing, his MH-47E helicopter received accurate rocket-propelled
  grenade and small arms fire, severely disabling the aircraft and causing it to crash land. The assault force formed a hasty
  defense and immediately suffered three fatalities and five critical casualties. Despite effective enemy fire, and at great
  risk to his own life, Airman Cunningham remained in the burning fuselage of the aircraft in order to treat the wounded.
  As he moved his patients to a more secure location, mortar rounds began to impact within fifty feet of his position.
  Disregarding this extreme danger, he continued the movement and exposed himself to enemy fire on seven separate
  occasions. When the second casualty collection point was also compromised, in a display of uncommon valor and
  gallantry, Airman Cunningham braved an intense small arms and rocket-propelled grenade attack while repositioning the
  critically wounded to a third collection point. Even after he was mortally wounded and quickly deteriorating, he
  continued to direct patient movement and transferred care to another medic. In the end, his distinct efforts led to the
  successful delivery of ten gravely wounded Americans to life-saving medical treatment. Through his extraordinary
  heroism, superb airmanship, aggressiveness in the face of the enemy, and in the dedication of his service to his country,
  Senior Airman Cunningham reflected the highest credit upon himself and the United States Air Force.

9.30. Profession of Arms Conclusion:
      9.30.1. We must remember that above all else, we are Airmen first. We, more than anyone else, understand the price
      that is paid for freedom. We, more than anyone else, understand the sacrifices that come from willingly serving our
      country. We, more than anyone else, understand what it means to belong to the Profession of Arms.
      9.30.2. We must learn from history. Our shared touchstone of warrior virtues and single, unifying purpose remain
      unchanged: fly, fight, and win. We must remain true to the legacy of valor and devotion, so boldly written with
      contrails and smoke across the skies from Ploesti and Schweinfurt, through MiG Alley and downtown Hanoi, to
      Kandahar and Baghdad. This legacy defines our role in the American way of war—to risk the lives of Airmen to kick
      down the opponent‘s door so thousands need not die.
Section 9G—Personal Professionalism
                The ultimate source of air and space combat capability resides in the men and women of the
                U.S. Air Force. We owe it to ourselves to continue our professional development to continue
                to hone our quality edge.
                                                                        General John Jumper
                                                                        Former Air Force Chief of Staff
9.31. Readiness:
      9.31.1. One of the telltale signs of a military professional is preparation. When the time comes to use their skills,
      military professionals are ready because they took advantage of opportunities to gain experience. Every military
      member will have opportunities to serve. Those may be mundane, exciting, or inconvenient, but each will be an
      opportunity to gain experience and to improve readiness levels.
      9.31.2. Often, opportunities to serve do not look particularly exciting or rewarding, but they hold the seeds of
      greatness. Doing such tasks builds the experience level needed to sharpen judgment and discernment. Military
      members should be open to a variety of experiences in order to grow in all areas of life (physical, mental, emotional,
      and spiritual). Military professionals cannot be disconnected from the world and must remember that the cost of
      choosing one path may be the opportunity to take another.
      9.31.3. The military professional who stands ready to make critical decisions and is able to perform under pressure is
      usually the one who took advantage of unique opportunities that arose. From past experiences, professionals build the
AFPAM36-2241         1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                         217

      confidence, judgment, courage, and integrity they need to act professionally. Will they always feel ready? Probably
      not, but most will likely say they wish they had more experience upon which to base their decisions or improve their
      performance. Most experience is gained by accepting opportunities as they come, even when conditions are not
      perfect.
      9.31.4. Certainly, no one can do everything. Members must select wisely to prevent overloading and burnout. They
      can round out their perspective vicariously by sharing others‘ experiences through reading. Charles, Archduke of
      Austria, pointed to this thought when he said, ―A great captain can be formed only by long experience and intense
      study; neither is his own experience enough—for whose life is…sufficiently fruitful of events to render his knowledge
      universal?‖
9.32. CSAF Professional Reading Program:
      9.32.1. In 1996, General Fogleman created the CSAF Professional Reading Program to develop a common frame of
      reference among Air Force members—officers, enlisted, and civilians—to help each become better, more effective
      advocates of air and space power. Each CSAF since then has enhanced and continued the CSAF‘s Professional
      Reading Program. In 2012, General Norton A. Schwartz revised the list by adding books; films; technology,
      entertainment, design (TED) briefings; and online resources.
      9.32.2. This program can help launch a career-long reading habit or be used to supplement previous readings. Listed
      materials cover various topics, although the majority detail air and space power from its genesis to recent times. These
      sources provide great examples of leadership to illustrate qualities Airmen should emulate. The list includes insight
      into Air Force history, analyze ongoing conflicts and their relevancy to the future, furnish organizational and
      leadership success stories, and provide lessons learned from recent conflicts. The more you study, the better you will
      understand the background behind the Air Force‘s core competencies and the better equipped you will be to form and
      express your own opinions.
      9.32.3. The Air Force Historian (HQ USAF/HO) is responsible for day-to-day management of the reading list. The
      reading list is particularly relevant as civilian men and women take on more responsibility in these times of global
      terrorism and international conflict. Most of the books were chosen because of their readability. Their selection does
      not reflect CSAF or U.S. Air Force endorsement of the authors‘ views or interpretations. Access the updated reading
      list and a brief summary of new selections at http://www.af.mil/library/csafreading/index.asp. Air University will
      supply each Air Force library with multiple copies of each new book on the list.
9.33. Core Values:
      9.33.1. Core values are at the heart and soul of the military profession: integrity first, service before self, and
      excellence in all we do. Such values are closely intertwined since integrity provides the bedrock for our military
      endeavors and is fortified by service to country. This in turn fuels the drive for excellence. In light of the demands
      placed upon our people to support U.S. security interests around the globe, the concept of ―service before self‖ needs
      further discussion. As members of the joint team, Airmen are part of a unique profession founded on the premise of
      service before self. Airmen are not engaged in just another job: they are practitioners of the profession of arms. They
      are entrusted with the security of the Nation, the protection of its citizens, and the preservation of its way of life. In
      this capacity, they serve as guardians of America‘s future. By its very nature, this responsibility requires Airmen to
      place the needs of service and country before personal concerns.
      9.33.2. The military profession is sharply distinguished from others by what General Sir John Hackett has termed the
      ―unlimited liability clause.‖ Upon entering the Air Force, Airmen accept a sacred trust from the American people.
      They swear to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
      They take this obligation freely without any reservations and thereby commit their lives in defense of America and its
      citizens.
      9.33.3. No other profession expects its members to lay down their lives for their friends, families, or freedoms. By
      voluntarily serving in the military profession, Airmen accept unique responsibilities. In today‘s world, service to
      country requires not only a high degree of skill, but also a willingness to make personal sacrifices. Airmen work long
      hours to provide the most combat capability possible for the taxpayer dollar. Military professionals go TDY or PCS to
      harsh locations to meet national security needs; are on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week; and when called, deploy to
      the far corners of the globe without complaint.
      9.33.4. Inherent in all of this is individual willingness to subordinate personal interests for the good of the unit,
      Service, and Nation. Airmen can ill afford ―sunshine soldiers,‖ or those who focus on careerism. Instead, the military
      needs professionals who strive to be the best at their current job, and who realize they attain individual advancement
      through the success of their unit or work center. Careerism can be most damaging in the case of leaders. If
218                                                                                   1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
      subordinates perceive leaders are consumed with career concerns, they will be unwilling to forgo personal goals for
      the good of the unit and the Air Force. This situation is only aggravated by attempts to serve ―through a position‖ or to
      do a quick ―touch and go‖ in a key job simply to fill out a resume. Ultimately, the mission will suffer with potentially
      devastating consequences.
      9.33.5. So, what is the payoff for placing service before self? It isn‘t solely the paycheck or the benefits that keep
      professionals going. Professionals remain with the Air Force because of the intangibles: the satisfaction gained from
      doing something significant with their lives, the pride in being part of a unique organization that lives by high
      standards, and the sense of accomplishment gained from defending the Nation and its democratic way of life.
9.34. Conclusion:
      9.34.1. This chapter discusses the philosophy, purpose, and structure of the enlisted force and examines the NCO in
      terms of rank and precedence, legal authority, and general and specific responsibilities. It also briefly describes the
      special positions of trust SNCOs may hold, such as AFCFM, first sergeant, CCM, and CMSAF, and concludes with a
      discussion of the profession of arms.
      9.34.2. The word ―professional‖ should inspire all enlisted members to aspire to the ideal of service and expertise.
      Professional status comes to people at different times in their lives and careers. Furthermore, it is achieved through
      continuous study, practice, and experience. Overall, the military seems to fit strongly into the professional category,
      but at what point can an individual claim professional military status? Professional status is expressed by attitudes and
      commitments, and by internalizing military values. Studying and understanding these factors are vital to the SNCO
      and the future of the United States Air Force. Every SNCO has an obligation to the United States, to the Air Force, and
      to his or her supervisor and subordinates to be the very best professional possible.
      9.34.3. Future military members must educate themselves through study, experience, and by observing others. They
      must learn to accept responsibility for their actions and those of their subordinates, and to take appropriate action,
      never hiding behind excuses. Their focus must be on devoted service to the Nation, not on pay, working conditions, or
      their next assignment. Only then will they move toward achieving the ideal of professionalism.

                                                         Chapter 10
                                                       LEADERSHIP

Section 10A—Overview
10.1. Introduction.
      Webster defines the word lead as ―to act as a guide‖ or ―to guide,‖ and leader as ―a person who leads, directs,
      commands, or guides a group or activity.‖ Both definitions are stated simply, but the underlying implications of
      leadership are many and deep. There is a significant difference between commanding and leading. Given the authority,
      anyone can command. Leading, on the other hand, is a delicate art calling for people-oriented attributes many find
      elusive or difficult to develop. However, with determination and practical experience, people can develop leadership
      attributes. Commanders depend upon noncommissioned officers (NCO) to lead Airmen to accomplish the mission.
      This chapter discusses the art of leadership and provides information to help members evaluate their own leadership
      abilities. Furthermore, it provides tips on how to become an effective leader using Air Force standards as a starting
      point, discusses the interrelationship of leadership and management, and lists beneficial leadership qualities. In
      addition, it covers the concept of vision and provides an overview on empowerment and learning. Finally, this chapter
      provides information on leadership flexibility and followership, dealing effectively with change, the critical
      relationship between leadership and core values, mentoring, and counseling.

Section 10B—Leadership
10.2. The Art of Leadership.
      Leadership is the art and science of motivating, influencing, and directing Airmen to accomplish the Air Force mission
      in joint warfare. This highlights two fundamental elements of leadership: (1) the mission, objective, or task to be
      accomplished, and (2) the Airmen who accomplish it. All facet of Air Force leadership should support these two
      fundamental elements. Accomplishing the mission is the primary task of every military organization; everything else
      must be subordinate. However, a successful leader recognizes that people perform the mission and without their
      support, the unit will fail. The Air Force expects its members to develop leadership skills. The nature and extent of that
      development depends on the member‘s status: officer, enlisted, or civilian. Air Force enlisted members will operate
      chiefly at the level of tactical expertise, where their technical skills are combined with their direct influence on
      subordinate members.
            ―Good leaders are people who have a passion to succeed….To become successful leaders, we must
            first learn that no matter how good the technology or how shiny the equipment, people-to-people
            relations get things done in our organizations. People are the assets that determine our success or
            failure. If you are to be a good leader, you have to cultivate your skills in the arena of personal
            relations.‖
                                                                        General Ronald R. Fogleman
                                                                        Former Air Force Chief of Staff
      10.2.1. Involvement.
            Good leaders get involved in their Airmen‘s careers. While people may obey arbitrary commands and orders,
            they respond quickly and usually give extra effort for leaders who genuinely care about them. An often
            neglected leadership principle in today‘s environment of technology and specialization is knowing the workers
            and showing sincere interest in their problems, career development, and welfare. Leadership is reflected in the
            degree of efficiency, productivity, morale, and motivation demonstrated by Airmen. Leadership involvement is
            the key ingredient to maximizing worker performance and hence the mission.
            ―Give people opportunities to take pride in their work and personal growth. People want to do well
            at their job; you have to help them do that.‖
                                                                        Robert D. Gaylor
                                                                        Former Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force #5
220                                                                                     1 OCTOBER 2013     AFPAM36-2241
      10.2.2. Accountability.
            Leaders must be ready to hold themselves and their people accountable for their actions. They must be prepared
            to face difficult problems head-on and understand the mission, the people, and the standards.
            ―Leaders lead by example and set the tone. Above all, they do not countenance selective enforcement
            of standards. I know of no more ruinous path…than selective enforcement of rules and standards.
            Excellent leaders have very high standards and they enforce them without fear or favors.‖
                                                                         General W. L. Creech (b. 1927-d. 2003)
                                                                         Former Commander, Tactical Air Command
      10.2.3. Setting the Example.
            Setting the example can sometimes be the toughest part of being a leader. However, to be successful, leaders
            must evaluate themselves and work on their shortcomings. Effective leaders lead rather than drive people. They
            make fair and firm decisions that are in the best interest of good order, discipline, and successful
            accomplishment of the mission. A leader‘s responsibilities go further than just being responsible for
            accomplishing the mission. Effective leaders are not only expected to accomplish the mission, but to do so with
            the minimum cost in people, materiel, and money. While no one expects the leader to be perfect, a leader cannot
            demand the best from others if he or she cannot perform as expected.
10.3. Leadership Self-Evaluation.
      A leader must understand the scope of his or her responsibilities. The following questions give insight into what is
      expected of a leader and can help anyone aspiring to develop the necessary leadership skills. If you are truly honest
      with yourself, you will probably not answer ―yes‖ to all of these questions. Your negative responses will provide you a
      direction upon which to focus your leadership improvement efforts.
      10.3.1. Do I have the courage to make tough decisions and stand by them?
      10.3.2. Am I flexible when dealing with changing situations?
      10.3.3. Can I remain enthusiastic and cheerful when I am confronted with seemingly impossible tasks?
      10.3.4. Am I willing to do my best with what seems to be inadequate means?
      10.3.5. Can I inspire people to achieve outstanding results?
      10.3.6. Am I willing to take reasonable risks to allow my Airmen to grow and become more productive?
      10.3.7. Am I willing to let my Airmen be creative?
      10.3.8. Does my manner invite communication?
      10.3.9. Do I really listen? Can I withhold judgment until I have all the facts?
      10.3.10. Am I willing to accept my Airmen‘s failures as my own, yet immediately recognize their successes as theirs?
      10.3.11. Am I able to do many things at one time? Can I manage a complex job?
      10.3.12. Can I carry out orders as well as give them?
10.4. Advice to Leaders.
      There are no magic formulas when it comes to being a successful leader—leadership is an individual and personal
      thing. Every leader develops a unique style. The best advice may be to ―be yourself.‖ However, aspiring leaders can
      still benefit from the recorded experiences of others. In 1976, while he was Commander in Chief, Pacific Air Forces,
      General Louis L. Wilson, Jr., wrote the following timeless advice:
      10.4.1. Be Tough.
            Set your standards high and insist that your people measure up. Have the courage to correct those who fail to do
            so. In the long run, your people will be happier. Almost certainly morale will be higher, your outfit better, and
            your people prouder.
      10.4.2. Get Out from Behind Your Desk.
            See for yourself what is going on in your work center. Your Airmen will see that you‘re interested in their
            problems, work conditions, and welfare. Many of your people problems will go away if you practice this point.
AFPAM36-2241          1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                     221

      10.4.3. Search Out the Problems.
            If you think there are no problems in your organization, you may be ignorant to problems that are not obvious.
            The trick is to find them. Foster an environment that encourages people to bring problems to you.
      10.4.4. Find the Critical Path to Success.
            Get personally involved in issues on a priority basis. Let your influence be felt on make-or-break issues in your
            organization. Avoid the ―activity trap‖—don‘t spend your valuable time on inconsequential or trivial matters.
            Weigh in where it counts.
      10.4.5. Be Sensitive.
            Listen to your people. Communicate with them and be perceptive to their needs. Learn to recognize problems
            and seek out ideas. Be innovative. Recognize that effective communication involves shared perceptions. Don‘t
            be afraid to empathize when necessary. Listen, listen, and listen!
      10.4.6. Do Not Take Things for Granted.
            Do not assume things have been fixed—look for yourself. Furthermore, don‘t assume problems will stay fixed.
            The probability is high that ―fixed‖ problems will recur, so regularly monitor your processes.
      10.4.7. Do Not Alibi.
            Remember, you and your people will never be perfect. People will make mistakes, so do not be defensive about
            things that are wrong. Nothing is more disgusting than the individual who can do no wrong and has an alibi for
            anything and everything that goes awry.
      10.4.8. Do Not Procrastinate.
            Do not put off those hard decisions because you are not willing to make them today; it won‘t be any easier
            tomorrow. This does not mean you should make precipitous or unreasonable decisions just to be prompt.
            However, once you have arrived at what you believe is correct, get on with it. Do not block progress.
      10.4.9. Do Not Tolerate Incompetence.
            Once people demonstrate laziness, disinterest, or an inability to get the job done, you must have the courage to
            terminate their assignments. You cannot afford to do less. On the other hand, when your people are doing good
            work, recognize it and encourage them. Certainly they will do even better.
      10.4.10. Be Honest.
            Tell it like it is and insist that your people do likewise. They set their behavior patterns based upon your
            example. Nothing is more disastrous than garbled information, half-truths, and falsifications. Make sure your
            people know where you stand on this matter. Encourage them to come to you if they have questions about what
            is going on in the unit. You must create an atmosphere of trust and confidence. Finally, be honest with
            yourself—don‘t gimmick reports and figures to make things look good on paper. Advice from a successful
            leader can be a beneficial tool to the aspiring leader, but where the aspiring leader applies this tool will
            determine his or her success. The perfect place to start is Air Force standards.
10.5. Air Force Standards.
      Air Force standards of conduct, discipline, and customs and courtesies reflect the Air Force‘s broad heritage and
      traditions. Air Force leaders must not only know these standards, they must also enforce them. While current
      Department of Defense and Air Force policies provide specific guidance on standards, leaders need to be familiar with
      the following areas:
      10.5.1. Mission.
            The Air Force exists to fly, fight, and win—to achieve strategic, operational, and tactical objectives—
            unhindered by time, distance, and geography. The Air Force‘s mission is to ―deliver sovereign options for the
            defense of the United States of America and its global interests—to fly and fight in air, space, and cyberspace.‖
      10.5.2. Oath.
            Upon entering the Air Force, each member voluntarily takes an oath. With continued service or reenlistment,
            enlisted members reaffirm their belief and commitment to the following oath:
222                                                                                 1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
            I, (name), do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United
            States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the
            same, and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the
            officers appointed over me according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So
            help me God.
      10.5.3. Way of Life.
            Air Force members are subject to duty 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. If so directed by a competent authority,
            they must report for duty at any hour, at any location, and must remain there as long as necessary to get the job
            done. The Air Force mission necessitates more restrictive rules and standards than are normally found in
            civilian life. Individuals unable to maintain these higher standards will not be retained in the Air Force.
      10.5.4. Chain of Command.
            The chain of command provides the control and communications necessary to accomplish the mission. Each
            level is responsible for a lower level and accountable to all higher levels. The chain cannot work without loyalty
            at every level. The key principle is to resolve problems and seek answers at the lowest possible level. With
            loyalty up and down the chain, a highly efficient and effective system is in place for getting things done.
      10.5.5. Conduct.
            The Air Force has a critical mission. Each member has specific responsibilities for accomplishing the mission.
            Each member must carry out orders, perform specific duty-related tasks, and live up to Air Force standards.
            Supervisors must make sure their Airmen meet these standards at all times. Standards of conduct apply both on
            and off duty, in personal behavior, and in the treatment of others in both military and civilian environments.
      10.5.6. Professional Relationships.
            To have an effective operation, the Air Force must have professional relationships among its members. In all
            supervisory situations, professional relationships must support the mission and operational effectiveness of the
            Air Force. Officers and NCOs must make sure their personal relationships with coworkers and Airmen do not
            give the appearance of favoritism or impropriety. Excessive socialization and undue familiarity, real or
            perceived, degrade leadership.
10.6. Leadership Versus Management.

                 "Leaders are people who do the right thing. Managers are people who do things right."
                                                                       Warren G. Bennis, Ph.D.
                                                                       Founding Chair, The Leadership Institute,
                                                                       University of Southern California
      10.6.1. Which Is More Important?
            Any discussion of leadership in today‘s Air Force must include the controversial issue of leadership versus
            management. Some believe military success depends on effective management; others that charismatic
            leadership is the key to success. In reality, a combination of both is essential.
      10.6.2. Roles of Leadership and Management.
            To better understand the roles of leadership and management, examine them in terms of three elements:
            behavior, personal characteristics, and organizational situation.
            10.6.2.1. Behavior:
            10.6.2.1.1. Managerial behavior is based on building organizational relations that mesh together like the parts of
            a timepiece. On the other hand, leadership behavior concentrates on making the hands of the timepiece move so
            as to display the time of day. The behavioral focus of each is clearly important; but, while the manager may be
            preoccupied with the precision of the process, the leader concentrates on the inertial forces that affect the
            process.
            "Management is getting people to do what needs to be done. Leadership is getting people to want to
            do what needs to be done.‖

                                                                       Warren G. Bennis, Ph.D.
                                                                       Founding Chair, The Leadership Institute,
                                                                       University of Southern California
AFPAM36-2241      1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                       223

           The words of Field Marshal Sir William Slim, who led the British Fourteenth Army in the conquest
           of Burma in World War II, are worthy of note:
           ―Leadership is of the spirit, compounded of personality and vision. Management is of the mind, more
           a matter of accurate calculation, statistics, methods, timetables, and routines."
                                                                     Field Marshal Sir William Slim
                                                                     British Fourteenth Army
                                                                     Burma, World War II

           10.6.2.1.2. Managers use the management process to control people by pushing them in the right direction.
           Leaders motivate and inspire people to keep moving in the right direction by satisfying human needs. In order
           to achieve a vision, leaders tailor their behavior toward their followers‘ needs for achievement, sense of
           belonging, recognition, self-esteem, and control over their lives. Bennis offers an appropriate summary of this
           behavioral characteristics comparison in Figure 10.1.

                            WHITE’S PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS COMPARISON
 Managers                                              Leaders
   Problem solvers                                        Analyze purposes and causes
   Statistics driven                                      Values driven
   Seek conflict avoidance                                Accept and invite conflict
   Thrive on predictability                               Ambiguous
   Ensure organizational objectives are achieved (even    Ensure their objectives and those of the organization
   if they disagree with them)                            become one and the same


           10.6.2.2. Personal Characteristics. Figure 10.1 also illustrates a comparison of successful leaders and
           managers, as researched by Professor Robert White, Indiana University. Neither type of behavior is exclusively
           positive or negative. Figure 10.1 suggests that leaders must have a grasp of management and leadership skills to
           be successful. Moreover, the two cannot and should not be separated. In other words, leadership is an art that
           includes management. The best managers tend to become good leaders because they develop leadership abilities
           and skills through practicing good management techniques. Similarly, seldom is there an effective leader who is
           not also a good manager. Successful leaders humanize their management skills with inspiration, empowerment,
           and vision through charisma.
           10.6.2.3. Organizational Situation:
           10.6.2.3.1. What are the organizational implications of management and leadership? Leaders launch and steer
           the organization toward the pursuit of goals and strategies, while managers ensure the resources needed to get
           there are available and used efficiently along the way. To achieve a plan, managers organize and staff jobs with
           qualified individuals, communicate the plan, delegate the responsibility for carrying out the plan, and devise
           systems to monitor implementation. Leaders, however, do not simply organize people—they align them. They
           understand the vision and are committed to it. (Note: The concept of vision is discussed in paragraph 10.8.)
           Additionally, they communicate the new direction to those who can create coalitions within and outside the
           organization.
           10.6.2.3.2. To be successful, an organization needs both leadership and management. For an organization,
           strong leadership with weak management is no better, and sometimes worse, than the opposite. The challenge is
           to achieve a balance of strong leadership and strong management. While not the most effective approach, a
           peacetime military can survive with good administration and management up and down the hierarchy, coupled
224                                                                                  1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
            with good leadership concentrated at the top. On the other hand, a wartime force must have competent
            leadership at all levels. Good management brings a degree of order and consistency to key issues like readiness,
            availability, and sustainment. However, no one has yet figured out how to manage people into battle. They must
            be led.
10.7. Leadership Qualities:
      10.7.1. Positive Attitude.
            Leaders wear their attitude on their sleeve, and by doing so, this same attitude is reflected in their Airmen.
            Enthusiasm is contagious and can deliver energy to all aspects of organizational operations. Although
            encouragement is normally considered an action, encouragement is actually attitude related. The inclination to
            encourage Airmen, as well as oneself, is a powerful motivator and satisfies human needs. Effective leaders
            constantly embrace positive goals and display a positive attitude.
      10.7.2. Values.
            The degree to which trust, loyalty, and integrity are present in the leadership of an organization directly relates
            to the organization‘s effectiveness. Leadership is the capacity to generate and sustain trust; trust is dependent
            upon reliability. Indicators of reliability such as punctual attendance at all meetings, prompt attention to
            correspondence, and meeting task deadlines translate into the level of trust people have in one another. Trust
            must also be balanced with a willingness to remove people who cannot be trusted and to make tough decisions
            when necessary. While the right decision is not always the easiest decision, your Airmen will respect you for
            doing the right thing in the long run. They will reward trust in leadership with their own trustworthiness and
            loyalty. Like trust, loyalty is a two-way street. Leaders cannot demand unwavering loyalty of their followers
            without being willing to return it. Integrity is a consistent and honest demonstration of personal commitment to
            the organization and its vision. Therefore, leaders should be ever mindful of the ramifications of their behavior
            and strive to epitomize the Air Force core value of integrity first.
      10.7.3. Character.
            The character traits of effective leaders include charisma, compassion, and courage. Effective leadership is a
            combination of competence and character. Lack of character, however, will most often prevent individuals from
            becoming great leaders.

            "But what if the leader, government-appointed or self-appointed, shouts, ―Follow me!‖ and no one
            does? When do men sometimes follow him, and shout enthusiastically too? Something called
            ―character‖ must be apparent in the leader. The followers must like him and want to be like him, or
            want him to like them. When it‘s over, they want him—private, sergeant, lieutenant, or even General
            Eisenhower—to clap them on the shoulder and say he‘s proud of them."
                                                                       Paul Fussell, Ph.D.,
                                                                       The Great War and Modern Memory
            10.7.3.1. Charisma. According to Webster, charisma is a special characteristic of leadership that inspires
            allegiance and devotion. Charisma can be effective, but is not a cure-all for leadership needs. German
            sociologist Max Weber‘s research noted that charisma is often contrary to authority; superiors consequently
            frown on it. Additionally, once it becomes ―old hat‖ to Airmen, charisma‘s attraction and powers wane. Further,
            Airmen can easily spot disingenuous charisma, a characteristic that eventually erodes mission effectiveness.
            10.7.3.2. Compassion. Coupled with understanding, compassion is an important leadership trait. Because the
            human psyche bruises easily, most Airmen withhold their true feelings, often to the point of distress.
            Additionally, if Airmen do not share their feelings, NCOs will struggle to help Airmen improve their
            performance. Compassion provides the stimulus to open up and discuss one‘s inner feelings.
            10.7.3.3. Courage. Courage can take many forms. Leaders must demonstrate courage not only in combat and
            high-risk situations, but they must also demonstrate moral courage to be sincere and honest in their day-to-day
            taskings. They need courage to tell the truth about their unit‘s performance level, to welcome new ideas, and to
            act and do the right thing. Their courage gives courage to their followers, helping them to maintain composure
            in stressful situations. Finally, it provides Airmen the motivation to endure hardships.
      10.7.4. Credibility.
            To be credible, leaders must have humility, commitment, and the ability to enhance the organization by drawing
            out the unique strengths of each member. They must get their hands dirty from time to time. Credibility is very
AFPAM36-2241           1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                          225

                fragile and takes years to earn through persistent, consistent, and patient leadership; yet credibility can be lost
                with one thoughtless remark, act, or broken agreement. In the present era, leaders are challenged to demonstrate
                their credibility even more. Successful leaders earn credibility through leading by example and taking
                responsibility.
                10.7.4.1. Leading by Example. Leaders lead by example. Leaders are positive role models when they lead by
                example and pay attention to what they believe is important. Through positive behavior, leaders show others
                that they live by their values. They reinforce their credibility when they do not dwell on the effort they have put
                forth. Plus, Airmen are impressed when leaders don‘t exhibit undue strain in difficult circumstances.
                10.7.4.2. Taking Responsibility. A crucial element of a leader‘s credibility is taking responsibility not only for
                his or her individual actions, but also for those of the Airmen.

                "All this has been my fault. It is I who have lost this fight, and you must help me out of it the best way
                you can."
                                                                  Attributed to General Robert E. Lee,
                                                                  Kent Masterson Brown‘s Retreat from Gettysburg
10.8. Vision.
      Air Force leaders must have a collective vision—vision that empowers, inspires, challenges, and motivates followers
      to the highest levels of commitment and a continuous process improvement environment. Therefore, we must embrace
      and communicate the Air Force Smart Operations for the 21st Century vision. The vision for Air Force Smart
      Operations for the 21st Century is to establish a continuous process improvement environment in which all Airmen are
      actively eliminating waste and continuously improving processes. These improvements must be centered around the
      core missions Airmen are responsible for conducting; specifically to maintain the asymmetric advantages and
      capabilities the Air Force delivers in air, space, and cyberspace. We need to ensure we are also driving efficiencies and
      improvements across the board. Therefore, we must use the right tools and techniques to see and attack problems and
      leverage opportunities for improvement and employ our greatest resource: innovative, dedicated Airmen.
      10.8.1. What Is Vision?
                10.8.1.1. Vision is helping people believe they can accomplish their goals and move toward a better future as a
                result of their own efforts. Inspiration is one way to convey vision. To better understand this concept, consider
                the following examples: President Franklin D. Roosevelt‘s announcement in May 1940 that the United States
                would produce 50,000 planes a year, and President John F. Kennedy‘s 1961 announcement of the United States
                intention to put a man on the moon within the decade. Both goals were breathtaking, perhaps impossible by
                most standards, and yet both were achieved. In each case, the dramatic announcement and the infectious
                inspiration it bred helped achieve the goal.
                10.8.1.2. A unique feature of the human brain is its ability to form mental images of the future and to translate
                these images into reality through leadership and action. A leader should constantly anticipate the influences,
                trends, and demands that will affect the vision next month, next year, and over the next decade. Unfortunately, a
                common leadership error is to become preoccupied with the present at the expense of the future. To be of
                realistic value, the vision must be logical, deductive, and plausible. Vision must be specific enough to provide
                real guidance to people, but unbounded enough to encourage initiative and demonstrate relevancy to a variety of
                conditions. Leaders without vision are doomed to perpetuate complacency. They fail to prosper because they
                continue doing things as they have always been done.
      10.8.2. Implementing the Vision.
                While senior leadership has the authority and responsibility to change the system as a whole, leaders at lower
                levels direct supervisors and subordinates to tasks more appropriate to the challenges of the new age. To do this,
                the leaders must communicate the vision to the unit, shop, or work center. Leaders are responsible for bolstering
                their Airmen‘s courage and understanding. However, launching a vision cannot be a solo effort. Those who
                work for and with the leader are excellent sources of ideas. Leaders can prepare the organization for potential
                changes to come and disarm resistance to change by soliciting suggestions and promoting wide participation.

                "A great leader‘s courage to fulfill his vision comes from passion, not position."
                                                                           John C. Maxwell
                                                                           The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership

      10.8.3. The Downside.
            Even a clearly articulated and achievable vision may flounder if appropriate resource management and
            leadership practices do not accompany it. Sometimes the vision becomes an obsession and, as a result,
            adversely affects leader and follower judgment. What is crucial about the vision is not its originality but how
            well it serves the mission requirements, strategic goals of the unit, and the Air Force as a whole.
      10.8.4. Maintaining the Vision.
            Every leader needs to establish an enduring vision. A vision that meets the organization‘s needs at the time of
            implementation, over time, is unlikely to be applicable without changes. There is no regular schedule for vision
            revision. However, a wise leader does not wait for the alarm to sound before considering alternatives. Rather,
            the vision-forming process should be continual. Leaders should encourage personnel of all ranks, levels, and
            occupations to help articulate the vision. The experience will prove invaluable as unit members are promoted
            into more responsible, higher-level positions and continue to build an effective path to the future. On the other
            hand, the vision should not be arbitrarily modified. If the vision works and is consistent with environmental and
            technological developments, it should be affirmed and supported. As technology and our environment continue
            to evolve, our vision and leadership style must keep pace.
10.9. Empowerment:
      10.9.1. Empowerment Defined.
            Empowerment is a force that energizes people and provides responsibility, ownership, and control over the
            work they perform. Some individuals interpret empowerment as merely the delegation of authority. Delegation
            is not empowerment; however, effective empowerment does require good delegation. Assigning people tasks,
            along with the freedom and authority needed to creatively accomplish the tasks, is the essence of empowerment.
            Consequently, empowerment is often confused with participative leadership—emphasizing sensitivity to needs,
            involving people, and asking people for help. While empowerment includes these concepts, it goes much
            further. Empowerment allows workers to become stakeholders in the organization‘s vision. Once they are
            committed to this vision, organization members begin to participate in shaping and fashioning it into a shared
            vision. This synergistically developed vision motivates people to focus on the future and what it holds, not
            simply because they must, but because they want to. For this approach to be successful, leaders must always be
            open and receptive to ideas and suggestions that could improve or refine the organization‘s vision.
      10.9.2. Essence of Empowerment:
            10.9.2.1. The essence of empowerment requires both leaders and followers to identify with their respective
            share of the organization‘s goals. The military is traditionally an authoritarian organization. The need for rapid
            decisionmaking and crisis response normally necessitates a traditional hierarchical framework. However,
            complex hierarchical frameworks do not always result in rapid decisions. Furthermore, the continual
            transformation of leader-follower roles is heralding an environment that allows both leaders and followers to
            more effectively realize organizational goals and objectives.
            10.9.2.2. Effective empowerment is not new. Truly great leaders of the past never directly told their people how
            to do their jobs. Rather, they explained what needed to be done and established a playing field that allowed their
            people to achieve success on their own. Consequently, the follower‘s success became a success for the leader
            and the organization as well. While the responsibility for task completion may be on the leader‘s shoulders, the
            burden of getting the job done is shared by all. Therefore, the adage, ―It‘s lonely at the top,‖ is applicable to a
            leader who does not recognize the strengths of his or her people. Airmen can supply the details and express
            concerns that help overcome barriers to achieving visionary goals and mission accomplishment. When leaders
            solicit input, they discover the knowledge, interest, and parameters of support.
      10.9.3. Guidelines to Empowerment.
            Empowerment enhances organizational performance by promoting contributions from every member of the
            organization. Trust is the cornerstone of the mutually dependent relationship shared by leaders and followers.
            Therefore, the leader must be flexible and patient in introducing empowerment. By delegating decisions to
            those closest to the issues and by allowing Airmen flexibility in how they implement the vision, the leader
            successfully allows others to take ownership of the vision and experience pride in achieving it. Thus, the leader
            must maintain a firm grip on operational requirements and strategic planning. The leader must also realize that
            not everyone is willing or ready to accept the reins of empowerment. To realize their potential in fulfilling the
            vision, empowered followers need sufficient training on the task at hand. Otherwise, they are doomed to fail.
            On the other hand, Airmen who have expert knowledge in a particular field should be encouraged to use this
AFPAM36-2241        1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                        227

            knowledge and improve the vision where and when possible. Recognition is a key factor in perpetuating
            improvements. Hence, an important facet of empowerment is the appropriate recognition of contributions
            Airmen make to maximize mission success.
      10.9.4. Potential Pitfalls.
            Empowerment is frequently misunderstood and applied inappropriately. Empowerment is often associated with
            a laissez-faire style of leadership (abdicating responsibility for tasks to Airmen who are left to their own
            devices). This fire-and-forget approach to empowerment demonstrates a total absence of leadership.
            Conversely, empowerment is a leader-subordinate relationship that requires even more refined supervisory
            skills than traditional autocracy. People continually need direction, knowledge, resources, and support.
            Furthermore, empowerment and vision cannot be imposed. To do so would breed compliance rather than
            commitment. From an application standpoint, many leaders seek consensus as a means to empower their people.
            However, while consensus is assumed to be good because it represents what the group as a whole wants,
            consensus is usually safe and free from innovative ideas. Additionally, consensus can divert an organization
            from its true goal or vision. The adage that ―a camel is a horse built by consensus‖ is not so farfetched. Leaders
            do not seek consensus—they build it.
10.10. Learning:
      10.10.1. The Leader’s Responsibilities.
            Life in the military incorporates a perpetual requirement for continued training and education. Effective leaders
            must accept the responsibility of being both a master student and master teacher and should influence others by
            example. Training is used to communicate and implement the organization‘s vision and values at the
            supervisory and subordinate levels. Training is not only fundamental in focusing the organization‘s strategic
            vision, but also helps develop the capabilities of the Airmen who make the vision a reality. Both formal and
            informal training do more than augment a unit‘s level of technical expertise. By providing the skills Airmen
            need to be successful, organizations realize increased energy and motivation.
      10.10.2. Fostering Growth:
            10.10.2.1. Leaders foster professional growth by insisting their Airmen focus attention on the aspects of a
            situation, mission, or project they control. This is not to say tasks should be limited in scope or challenge. On
            the contrary, some adventure should be an integral part of every job. In order to motivate Airmen to learn and
            excel, leaders should provide challenging and enlightening experiences. Consequently, some supervisors want
            to tell an Airman what to do to improve. While this may impress the follower with the leader‘s knowledge, it
            creates an unnecessary dependence on the leader and critically limits the follower‘s value of the experience.
            10.10.2.2. The role of the leader in fostering growth is to identify and analyze knowledge and improvement
            opportunities. This will ensure advancements are permanent and pervasive, not temporary and specific. Leaders
            encourage the learning process by formally recognizing individual and unit successes, no matter how large or
            small. A more formal and direct way for the leader to encourage the subordinate to learn is by setting standards.
            Standards have the multiple effects of providing feedback to the leader on performance, ensuring quality control
            of unit output, and giving Airmen a goal and inspiration for developing and performing to do their best.

            People want to know what is expected of them. No one goes to work and says, ―I am going to do a lousy job
            today.‖ People work to succeed, and they need to know how you measure that success. Allow for a few
            mistakes because people must be given the latitude to learn.
                                                                       General H. Norman Schwarzkopf, Jr., Retired
                                                                       Former Commander, U.S. Central Command
      10.10.3. Developing Airmen:
            10.10.3.1. To develop Airmen, a leader must:
            10.10.3.1.1. Train replacements (the next generation).
            10.10.3.1.2. Develop an understanding of roles and responsibilities.
            10.10.3.1.3. Be an advisor and mentor.
            10.10.3.1.4. Provide an opportunity for growth and promotion.
            10.10.3.1.5. Clarify expectations.
228                                                                                    1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
            10.10.3.1.6. Strengthen service identity.
            10.10.3.1.7. Allow Airmen to make decisions and experience leadership.
            10.10.3.1.8. Encourage and facilitate formal education.
            10.10.3.2. An important milestone in any Airman‘s development process is to experience a significant challenge
            early in his or her career. Developing Airmen for leadership positions requires much work over long periods of
            time. Identifying people with leadership potential early in their careers and then determining the appropriate
            developmental challenges for them is the first step. Leaders must recognize and diagnose the capabilities of
            each Airman in their unit or organization. Those capabilities may include any skills, talents, experiences,
            personality temperaments, etc., the Airman may have that can contribute to current and future mission
            accomplishment. Leaders must also diagnose the developmental needs of Airmen and then assist them with
            personal and professional developmental needs that fulfill current or future job/role and responsibilities.
            Professional development needs may include off-duty education, Professional Military Education (PME),
            specific skill training, additional training, professional development seminars/courses, and communication
            skills, etc. Personal developmental needs may include relationships, interpersonal skills, communication skills,
            supervisory skills, off-duty education, etc. Today‘s effective leaders had opportunities early in their careers that
            required them to lead, take risks, and learn from their triumphs and failures. In business, successful corporations
            do not wait for leaders to come along. Rather, they actively seek out people with leadership potential and
            expose them to career experiences designed to develop their skills. However, leaders must caution themselves
            against becoming preoccupied with finding and developing young leadership potential. Leaders must guard
            against overlooking the ―late bloomer‖ whose leadership potential was not evident early on. A late bloomer‘s
            combination of maturity, experience, and untapped potential is a valuable asset to any organization.
      10.10.4. Dealing with Setbacks:
            10.10.4.1. To learn and improve, people need to be encouraged to try new things; sometimes their efforts will
            fail. A fundamental aspect of empowerment is acknowledging the right to fail. Obviously, some common sense
            is required. There can be no tolerance for violating regulations, jeopardizing safety, or failing due to a lack of
            effort. However, if the setback is the result of a failed attempt, applaud the initiative and dissect it so the Airman
            can learn from what went wrong. Unfortunately, the fear of failure prevents many otherwise capable individuals
            from pursuing their creativity and innovation. An Airman‘s dedication to improving his or her abilities is quite a
            valuable asset to an organization. Followers must remain optimistic, even in times of adversity.
            10.10.4.2. Some people believe the key to success is to avoid failure. Consequently, they stay with the things
            they know and do well rather than risk failure by trying something new. The surest way to stifle creativity and
            innovation is to allow fear to perpetuate complacency. Airmen count on the experience and understanding of
            strong leaders in dealing with setbacks. There is no substitute for being able to say to an Airman, ―I know what
            you‘re feeling, I‘ve experienced similar setbacks. Here is how I chose to deal with the situation, and these are
            what the consequences of my actions were. Reflecting back on the situation, here is what I would do now if I
            had the chance to do things over.‖
10.11. Dealing with Change:
      10.11.1. Because leadership is charged with introducing new ideas, methods, or solutions, innovation is inextricably
      connected with the process of being an effective leader. Innovation means change, and change requires leadership.
      Leaders must be the chief transformation officers in their organizations and learn everything there is to know about the
      change before it even takes place. Furthermore, they must learn how to deal with the emotions that result from the
      chaos and fear associated with change. Putting new processes in place is not enough. The people supporting these
      processes must be motivated to meet the challenge and support the change. To achieve that, leaders must maintain a
      clear understanding of the present and a clear focus on the future.
      10.11.2. The leader must create an organizational climate conducive to change by explaining the limitations and
      shortfalls of the present process and the possibilities and benefits of the proposed change. Next, the leader must
      facilitate the change itself: walk Airmen through the change, explain the details, and answer questions. Finally, the
      leader should reward those who comply with the change and refocus those who do not. Tough-minded optimism is the
      best quality a leader can demonstrate when coping with change. Leaders coping with change should:
            10.11.2.1. Involve people in the change process.
            10.11.2.2. Fully explain the reason for change.
            10.11.2.3. View change positively.
AFPAM36-2241        1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                             229

             10.11.2.4. Create enthusiasm for the change.
             10.11.2.5. Facilitate change (avoid forcing it).
             10.11.2.6. Be openminded and experiment with alternatives.
             10.11.2.7. Seek out and accept criticism.
             10.11.2.8. Never get complacent.
10.12. The Air Force Core Values.
      The Air Force core values are the bedrock of leadership in the Air Force. The core values are a statement of those
      institutional values and principles of conduct that provide the moral framework within which military activities take
      place. The professional Air Force ethic consists of three fundamental and enduring values of integrity, service, and
      excellence. This ethic is the set of values that guides the way Air Force members live and perform. Success hinges on
      the incorporation of these values into the character of every Airman. In today‘s time—compressed, dynamic, and
      dangerous operational environment—an Airman does not have the luxury of examining each issue at leisure. He or she
      must fully internalize these values to be able to automatically act in all situations to maintain integrity, to serve others
      before self, and to perform with excellence and encourage others to do the same. The Air Force core values—Integrity
      First, Service Before Self, and Excellence In All We Do—represent the commitment each Airman makes when joining
      the Air Force. These values provide a foundation for leadership, decisionmaking, and success, whatever the level of
      assignment, difficulty, or dangers presented by the mission.
             All Airmen are men and women of character. Our enduring Air Force Core Values provide a touchstone as
             we rise to meet current and future challenges, threats, and opportunities. As America‘s Airmen, it is
             imperative that we maintain the moral high ground—our Nation depends on it.
                                                                     Michael W. Wynne
                                                                     Former Secretary of the Air Force
             Core Values help those who join us to understand right from the outset what‘s expected of them. Equally
             important, they provide all of us, from airman to four-star general, with a touchstone—a guide in our own
             conscience—to remind us of what we expect from ourselves. We have wonderful people in the Air Force. But
             we aren‘t perfect. Frequent reflection on the core values helps each of us refocus on the person we want to be
             and the example we want to set.
                                                                     General Michael E. Ryan, Retired
                                                                     Former Air Force Chief of Staff
      10.12.1. Integrity First.
             Integrity is the willingness to do what is right even when no one is looking. Integrity is the "moral compass,"
             the inner voice, the voice of self-control, and the basis for the trust imperative in today‘s Air Force. Integrity is
             the single most important part of character. Integrity makes Airmen who they are and what they stand for, and is
             as much a part of their professional reputation as their ability to fly or fix jets, operate the computer network,
             repair the runway, or defend the airbase. Airmen must be professional, in and out of uniform. Integrity is not a
             suit that can be taken off at night or on the weekend or worn only when important to look good. Instead, it is
             when we least expect to be tested that integrity is critical. People are watching us, not to see us fail but to see us
             live up to their expectations; anything less risks putting the heritage and reputation of the Air Force in peril.
             Integrity is the ability to hold together and properly regulate all the elements of one‘s personality. A person of
             integrity acts on conviction, demonstrating impeccable self-control without acting rashly. Integrity encompasses
             many characteristics indispensable to Airmen.
             Integrity is the fundamental premise of service in a free society. Without integrity, the moral pillars of our
             military strength—public trust and self-respect—are lost.
                                                                          General Charles Gabriel, 11th CSAF
      10.12.2. Service Before Self.
             10.12.2.1. As an Air Force core value, service before self represents an abiding dedication to the age-old
             military virtue of selfless dedication to duty, including putting one‘s life at risk if called to do so. The service-
             before-self value deals with accepting expeditionary deployments and assignments. Service before self does not
             mean service before family. Airmen have a duty to their families just as strong as that to the service. The
230                                                                                 1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
            difference is there are times the service and Nation will require them to be away from home. Their
            responsibilities to their families include ensuring they are cared for when deployed or when duty away requires
            it.
            10.12.2.2. This value also demands that each Airman keep ―faith‖ in the system. This doesn‘t imply that we
            follow our leaders blindly and not sometimes question what we are doing. Airmen must always place trust in
            the processes, procedures, and other Airmen to get the job done in the right way. Airmen must understand that
            an organization can only achieve excellence in an atmosphere free from fear, unlawful discrimination, sexual
            harassment, intimidation, hazing, or unfair treatment. Airmen must show loyalty to their leadership, fellow
            Airmen, and the Air Force as a whole, including showing commitment to the Constitution, military chain of
            command, and to both the President and Secretary of Defense.
            I have been recognized as a hero for my ten minutes of action over Vietnam, but I am no more a hero than
            anyone else who has served this country.
                                                                      A1C John L. Levitow, lowest ranking Air Force
                                                                      Medal of Honor Recipient
      10.12.3. Excellence In All We Do.
            10.12.3.1. This core value demands Airmen constantly strive to perform at their best. They should always strive
            to exceed standards objectively based on mission needs. This demands a continuous search for new and
            innovative ways to accomplish the mission without jeopardizing morale and loyalty.
            10.12.3.2. Personally, Airmen seek out and complete developmental education. They constantly work hard to
            stay in their best physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, and moral shape. Airmen continue to enhance their
            professional competencies and are diligent to maintain their job skills, knowledge, and personal readiness at the
            highest possible levels. They understand that when members of an organization work together to successfully
            reach a common goal, excellence is achieved and no Airman wins the fight alone. Each organization must foster
            a culture that emphasizes a team mentality while simultaneously maintaining standards and accomplishing the
            mission. Realizing that people are our most precious resource, Airmen are responsible for ensuring they are
            trained, fit, focused, and ready to accomplish the mission safely and effectively.
            The power of excellence is overwhelming. It is always in demand and nobody cares about its color.
                                                                      General Daniel ‗Chappie‘ James, First African-
                                                                      American United States Air Force Four-Star General
      10.12.4. Air Force Viewpoint.
            The Air Force recognizes these core values as universal and unchanging in the profession of arms. They provide
            the standards used to evaluate the ethical climate of all Air Force organizations. Finally, when needed in the
            cauldron of war, they are the beacons that light the path of professional conduct and the highest ideals of
            integrity, service, and excellence.

Section 10C—Followership
10.13. Introduction.
      Preoccupation with leadership often prevents us from considering the nature and importance of followership. At some
      point, everyone is a follower. Few leaders became successful without first having learned followership skills.
      Therefore, leaders must recognize the importance and qualities of followership, the needs of followers, and ways to
      promote followership.
10.14. Importance of Followership.
      Today‘s leader has the almost impossible task of keeping up with ever-changing technology while coping with
      leadership demands. In many cases, the leader is not the most technically skilled person in the unit. He or she likely
      has personnel with advanced technological skills and capabilities. People are our most valuable resource. Today‘s
      junior members have knowledge, skills, and abilities that open unlimited opportunities to maximize work center
      effectiveness. Therefore, leaders must tap into this resource by nurturing and developing their Airmen‘s capabilities
      and fostering their willingness to improve organizational effectiveness.
AFPAM36-2241        1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                          231

10.15. Qualities of Followership.
      The following 10 qualities are essential for good followership. However, this list is neither inflexible nor exhaustive:
      10.15.1. Organizational Understanding.
             Effective followers must be able to see how their work contributes to the organization‘s big picture.
      10.15.2. Decisionmaking.
             Followers must be able to make sound decisions using a team approach.
      10.15.3. Communication Skills.
             Followers must have effective communication skills. These skills are crucial when working in a team
             environment, especially when providing feedback to team members.
      10.15.4. Commitment.
             Being able to successfully contribute to the organization, while striving to achieve personal goals, requires a
             strong level of follower commitment.
      10.15.5. Problem Solving.
             A broader scope of responsibility to help identify and resolve work center problems requires followers to share
             their knowledge, skills, and experience.
      10.15.6. Integrity.
             Followers must demonstrate loyalty and a willingness to act according to accepted beliefs. Integrity requires one
             to identify and be true to values.
      10.15.7. Adaptability.
             Ever-changing roles, missions, and systems require followers to be adaptable to change without being paralyzed
             by the stress of not knowing all the answers.
      10.15.8. Self-Employment.
             Followers must take responsibility for their own careers, actions, and development.
      10.15.9. Courage.
             Followers must have the confidence and guts to do and say the right things at the right times.
      10.15.10. Credibility.
             By demonstrating competency in their words and deeds, followers earn trust and an honorable reputation.
10.16. Follower Needs.
      Successful leaders must devote attention to what their Airmen want and expect. Otherwise, leaders may lose the
      opportunity to capitalize on their talents or lose their Airmen‘s respect. Followers need to know they can count on their
      leaders when the going gets tough. Furthermore, respect is a two-way street; followers also want to be respected.
      Followers treated as if they are not important, or who perceive that they are not important, lose their willingness and
      desire to perform. Leaders demonstrate belief in their Airmen by (1) maintaining or enhancing their Airmen‘s self-
      esteem, (2) listening carefully to their Airmen and responding with empathy, and (3) asking for their Airmen‘s help
      and encouraging their involvement. A few moments of sincerity and thoughtfulness go a long way toward satisfying
      Airmen‘s basic needs. Followers perform best when they want to be in a unit, not when they are trapped in it.
10.17. Ways to Promote Followership.
      Empowered followership, like motivation, requires a joint effort between leaders and the individuals they lead. This
      effort must be continuously promoted. Leaders must listen and respond to the ideas and needs of their followers, and
      followers are similarly required to listen and respond to the ideas and needs of their leaders. Mutual trust is the axis
      around which this synergistic relationship revolves; the benefits reaped are plentiful. Team requirements are best
      served when the leader helps followers develop their own initiatives, encourages them to use their own judgment, and
      allows them to grow and become more effective communicators. As a result of promoting empowered followership,
      follower skills such as troubleshooting, problem solving, information gathering, conflict resolution, and change
      management will improve dramatically. Another way to promote empowered followership is by getting out among the
232                                                                                  1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
      Airmen and sharing their interests. Airmen respond to leaders who show sincere interest in them. The success of great
      leaders depends on their ability to establish a base of loyal, capable, and knowledgeable followers.

Section 10D—Mentoring
10.18. Mentor Defined.
      A mentor is a trusted counselor or guide. Mentoring, therefore, is a relationship in which a person with greater
      experience and wisdom guides another person to develop both personally and professionally. The long-term health of
      the Air Force depends upon the experienced member developing the next in line.
10.19. Mentoring Scope:
      10.19.1. Mentoring helps prepare people for the increased responsibilities they will assume as they progress in their
      careers. Mentoring is not a promotion enhancement program; mentoring is an ongoing process and not confined to the
      formal feedback required by AFI 36-2406, Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Systems, and AFI 36-1001, Managing the
      Civilian Performance Program. Moreover, mentoring is a professional development program designed to help each
      individual reach his or her maximum potential. Professional development is not a new concept and occurs at every
      echelon and activity. AFI 36-2909, Professional and Unprofessional Relationships, and AFI 36-703, Civilian Conduct
      and Responsibility, explains the standards regarding professional relationships. In particular, mentoring is part of a
      professional relationship because it fosters communication between subordinates and supervisors concerning careers,
      performance, duties, and missions. Finally, it enhances morale and discipline and improves the operational
      environment while maintaining respect for authority.
      10.19.2. Air Force mentoring covers a wide range of areas, such as career guidance, technical and professional
      development, leadership, Air Force history and heritage, air and space power doctrine, strategic vision, and
      contributions to joint warfighting. Therefore, it includes knowledge of the military ethics and an understanding of the
      Air Force‘s core values: Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence In All We Do.
      10.19.3. Commanders and supervisors must encourage Airmen to read and comprehend air and space power literature,
      such as Air Force doctrine and operational war-fighting publications and the books in the Chief of Staff of the Air
      Force (CSAF) Professional Reading Program.
10.20. Assignment of Mentors:
      10.20.1. The immediate supervisor or rater is the primary mentor (coach, counselor, guide, role model) for each of his
      or her Airmen. This designation in no way restricts the subordinate‘s desire to seek additional counseling and
      professional development advice from other sources or mentors. Supervisors and commanders must make themselves
      available to Airmen who seek career guidance and counsel.
      10.20.2. Key to the mentoring process is direct involvement by the commander and supervisor. Commanders and
      supervisors must continually challenge their Airmen to improve. They must provide clear performance feedback and
      guidance in setting realistic near-, mid-, and long-term professional and personal development goals.
      10.20.3. Several programs exist to help the commander and supervisor focus attention on an Airman‘s professional
      development. Among these are performance feedback, PME, academic education opportunities, assignment policies,
      recognition programs, and the individual‘s own personal development actions. Additionally, many organizations,
      programs, and associations are dedicated to the advancement and education of military professionals. The first
      sergeant, base education center, and Airman and Family Readiness Center can provide lists and contact information
      for organizations that support military development. Leaders should also ensure that Airmen are aware of specific
      tools available to them such as the Enlisted Development Plan available via MyEDP .
10.21. Mentoring Responsibilities.
      Air Force leaders have an inherent responsibility to mentor future leaders. Supervisors must take an active role in their
      Airmen‘s professional development. They must assist their people by providing realistic evaluations of both
      performance and potential. Supervisors must also be positive role models. At minimum, mentoring consists of a
      discussion of performance, potential, and professional development plans during the performance feedback session.
      The feedback should include promotion, PME, advanced degree work, physical fitness, personal goals and
      expectations, professional qualities, next assignment, and long-range plans, at minimum. Mentors must distinguish
      between individual goals, career aspirations, and realistic expectations. Each individual defines a successful career
      differently. There are numerous paths to meet individual career and success goals. Foremost, however, individuals
      must focus on Air Force institutional needs. The Air Force must develop people skilled in the employment and support
      of air and space power and how it meets national security needs. While there is nothing wrong with lofty goals,
      mentors must ensure personnel realize what high but achievable goals are.
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                        233

10.22. Professional Military Education and Academic Education.
      PME and academic education enhance performance in each phase of professional development and build on the
      foundation of leadership abilities shown during the earlier stages of an individual‘s career. The role of PME in
      professional development is to prepare individuals to take on increased responsibilities appropriate to their grade and
      to enhance their contribution to the Air Force. Members should focus on enhancing professional competence and
      becoming superior leaders, while expanding their operational employment of air, space, and cyberspace power
      knowledge. Post-secondary degrees (associate, bachelor‘s, master‘s, or other advanced academic degrees) are
      important to professional development to the extent that they enhance the degree holder‘s job and professional
      qualifications. A degree directly related to an individual‘s primary specialty area or occupational series is the most
      appropriate because it adds to his or her depth of knowledge. This is why senior noncommissioned officers are
      required to complete the Senior Noncommissioned Officer Academy by correspondence or in residence and obtain a
      Community College of the Air Force degree (any specialty) to receive a senior rater endorsement on their performance
      reports. (Note: This requirement is the minimum criteria for endorsement consideration and does not guarantee
      automatic endorsement.) A master‘s or doctorate degree in management or more general studies enhances job
      performance for personnel reaching the highest grade levels, where duties may require broader managerial skills. In
      some career fields, advanced formal education is a prerequisite for certain jobs.
10.23. Professional Associations.
      Many private organizations develop professional skills and associations for individuals in many career fields and
      technical specialties. Membership in such associations may provide additional opportunities for mentoring as well as
      broaden technical expertise. Most Air Force bases have private organizations for each rank tier (for example, Top III
      (MSgt-Chief)).
10.24. Evaluation and Performance Feedback.
      Air Force evaluation systems are designed to accurately appraise performance. Substantive, formal feedback          is
      essential to the effectiveness of the evaluation systems. Performance evaluation systems are an integral part       of
      mentoring and professional development. Performance feedback is designed to provide a realistic assessment          of
      performance, career standing, future potential, and actions required to help the ratee reach the next level         of
      professional development.
10.25. Promotion Selection.
      The Weighted Airman Promotion System outlines the requirements for promotion selection (SSgt through MSgt) and
      provides feedback score sheets to enlisted members considered for promotion. These score sheets help the individual
      to determine professional development needs. Selection for promotion to Senior Master Sergeant and Chief Master
      Sergeant is accomplished using an integrated weighted and central selection board system. In addition to the weighted
      score, the central selection board evaluates each individual using the ―whole person concept.‖ Board scores are
      determined by considering performance, leadership, breadth of experience, job responsibility, professional
      competence, specific achievements, and education. The board score is added to the weighted score to determine order
      of merit for promotion.
10.26. The Military Assignment System.
      The mentor and the individual should both focus on obtaining an assignment that enhances professional development
      and meets Air Force needs without necessarily keying on a specific position or location. The individual is expected to
      do well in his or her current assignment. When an individual becomes eligible for reassignment, he or she should
      address assignment preferences with the supervisor. Assignments should complement the individual‘s professional
      development needs and be second only to mission requirements. Supervisors can use the career field education and
      training plan to help develop career path guidance.
10.27. Recognition, Awards, and Decorations.
      Military members are eligible for consideration for various decorations throughout their careers. However, supervisors
      should not submit recommendations just to ―do something for their people.‖ Supervisors should restrict
      recommendations to recognitions of meritorious service, outstanding achievement, etc., that clearly place the
      individual above his or her peers.
234                                                                                       1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
Section 10E—Developmental Counseling
10.28. Airman Development.
      Airman leadership development is one of the most important responsibilities of every Air Force leader. Developing
      future leaders should be one of the highest priorities of a leader. The future of the Air Force rests on the shoulders of
      those prepared for greater responsibility.
10.29. Purpose.
      Developmental counseling is a shared effort. Leaders assist Airmen in identifying strengths and weaknesses and
      creating plans of action. Leaders then support them throughout the plan implementation and assessment. However, to
      achieve success, Airmen must be forthright in their commitment to improve and candid in their own assessment and
      goal setting.
10.30. Leader Responsibilities.
      Leaders coach Airmen the same way athletic coaches improve their teams: by identifying weaknesses, setting goals,
      developing and implementing plans of action, and providing oversight and motivation throughout the process.
      Effective coaches or leaders must thoroughly understand the strengths, weaknesses, and professional goals of their
      Airmen. Air Force leaders conduct counseling to help Airmen become better members of the team, maintain or
      improve performance, and prepare for the future. To conduct effective counseling, leaders should develop a counseling
      style using the characteristics listed in Figure 10.2.
Figure 10.2. Characteristics of Effective Counseling.
 Purpose:                Clearly define the purpose of the counseling.
 Flexibility:            Fit the counseling style to the character of each subordinate and to the relationship desired.
 Respect:                View Airmen as unique, complex individuals, each with a distinct set of values, beliefs, and attitudes.
 Communication:          Establish open, two-way communication with Airmen using spoken language, nonverbal actions,
                         gestures, and body language. Effective counselors listen more than they speak.
 Support:                Encourage Airmen through actions while guiding them through their problems.

10.31. The Leader as a Counselor.
      Air Force leaders must demonstrate certain qualities to be effective counselors. These qualities include respect for
      Airmen, self-awareness, cultural awareness, empathy, and credibility.
      10.31.1. Respect for Airmen.
                Allowing Airmen to take responsibility for their own ideas and actions is a show or respect and helps create
                mutual respect in the leader-subordinate relationship. Mutual respect improves the chances of changing or
                maintaining behavior and achieving goals.
      10.31.2. Self-Awareness.
                Leaders must be fully aware of their own values, needs, and biases before counseling Airmen. Self-aware
                leaders are less likely to project their biases onto Airmen. Also, aware leaders are more likely to act consistently
                with their own values and actions.
      10.31.3. Cultural Awareness.
                Leaders need to be aware of the similarities and differences between individuals of different cultural
                backgrounds and how these factors may influence values, perspectives, and actions. Unfamiliarity with cultural
                backgrounds may hinder leaders in addressing cultural issues, especially if they generate concerns within the
                organization or hinder team-building. Cultural awareness enhances a leader‘s ability to display empathy.
      10.31.4. Empathy.
                Empathy is to be understanding of and sensitive to another person‘s feelings, thoughts, and experiences to the
                point that you can almost feel or experience them yourself. Leaders with empathy can put themselves in their
                Airman‘s shoes and see a situation from the other person‘s perspective. Understanding the Airman‘s position
                can help the Airman develop a plan of action that fits his or her personality and needs—one that works for the
                Airman. Not fully comprehending a situation from the Airman‘s point of view gives a leader less credibility and
                influence. As a result, the Airman is less likely to commit to the agreed-upon plan of action.
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                         235

      10.31.5. Credibility.
            Leaders achieve credibility by being honest and consistent in their statements and actions. Using a
            straightforward style and behaving in a manner that Airmen respect and trust makes a leader credible. Leaders
            can earn credibility by repeatedly demonstrating a willingness to assist and being consistent in what they say
            and do. It is difficult to influence Airmen without credibility.
10.32. Leader Counseling Skills.
      Leaders should seek to develop and improve their own counseling abilities. The techniques needed to provide effective
      counseling vary from person to person and session to session. However, general skills needed in almost every situation
      include active listening, responding, and questioning.
      10.32.1. Active Listening.
            During counseling, leaders must actively listen. By actively listening, leaders communicate verbally and
            nonverbally that they have received the message. To learn more about active listening, refer to Chapter 14,
            Communicating in Today‘s Air Force.
      10.32.2. Responding.
            A leader responds both verbally and nonverbally to communicate understanding and to clarify and confirm what
            has been said. Verbal responses consist of summarizing, interpreting, and clarifying the message. Nonverbal
            responses include eye contact and occasional gestures such as a head nod.
      10.32.3. Questioning.
            Although questioning is a necessary skill, use it with caution. Too many questions can aggravate the power
            differential between a leader and an Airman and place the Airman in a passive mode. The Airman may also
            react to excessive questioning as an intrusion of privacy and become defensive. During a leadership
            development review, ask questions to obtain information or to get the Airman to think about a particular
            situation. Generally, questions should be open-ended to evoke more than a ―yes‖ or ―no‖ answer. Well-posed
            questions may help to verify understanding, encourage further explanation, or help the Airman move through
            the stages of the counseling session.
10.33. Types of Developmental Counseling.
      Developmental counseling can be categorized based on the topic of the session. Event-oriented counseling and
      performance and professional growth counseling are the two major categories of counseling.
      10.33.1. Event-Oriented Counseling.
            Event-oriented counseling involves a specific event or situation and may precede events such as applying for a
            special duty assignment or attending a school. It may follow events such as a noteworthy duty performance, a
            problem with performance or mission accomplishment, or a personal problem. Event-oriented counseling
            includes, but is not limited to:
            10.33.1.1. Counseling for Specific Instances. Sometimes counseling is tied to specific instances of superior or
            substandard duty performance. Leaders must tell Airmen whether or not their performance met the standard and
            what they did right or wrong. The key to successful counseling for specific performance is to conduct the
            counseling as close to the event as possible. Leaders should counsel Airmen for specific examples of superior as
            well as substandard duty performance.
            10.33.1.2. Crisis Counseling. Leaders may conduct crisis counseling to get an Airman through the initial shock
            after receiving negative news, such as notification of the death of a loved one. Listening and, as appropriate,
            providing assistance may greatly assist the Airman dealing with a crisis.
            10.33.1.3. Referral Counseling. Referral counseling helps Airmen work through a personal situation and may
            or may not follow crisis counseling. Referral counseling may also act as preventive counseling before the
            situation becomes a problem. Usually, the leader assists the Airman in identifying the problem and refers the
            subordinate to the appropriate resource, such as legal services, a chaplain, or an alcohol and drug counselor.
      10.33.2. Performance and Professional Growth Counseling.
            During performance and professional growth counseling, conduct a review of an Airman‘s duty performance
            during a certain period and set standards for the next period. Rather than dwelling on the past, focus the session
            on the Airman‘s strengths, areas needing improvement, and potential.

10.34. Approaches to Counseling.
        An effective leader approaches each Airman as an individual. Different people and different situations require
        different counseling approaches. Three approaches to counseling include nondirective, directive, and combined. These
        approaches differ in the techniques used, but they all fit the definition of counseling and contribute to its overall
        purpose. The major difference between the approaches is the degree to which the Airman participates and interacts
        during a counseling session. Figure 10.3 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.
        10.34.1. Nondirective.
              The nondirective approach is preferred for most counseling sessions. During the counseling session, listen
              rather than make decisions or give advice. Clarify what is said. Cause the Airman to bring out important points
              to better understand the situation. When appropriate, summarize the discussion. Avoid providing solutions or
              rendering opinions; instead, maintain a focus on individual and organizational goals and objectives. Ensure the
              Airman‘s plan of action supports those goals and objectives.
        10.34.2. Directive.
              The directive approach works best to correct simple problems, make on-the-spot corrections, and correct aspects
              of duty performance. The leader using the directive style does most of the talking and tells the Airman what to
              do and when to do it. In contrast to the nondirective approach, the leader directs a course of action for the
              Airman. Choose this approach when time is short, when you alone know what to do, or if an Airman has limited
              problem-solving skills. Finally, directive is appropriate when an Airman is immature, insecure, or needs
              guidance.
        10.34.3. Combined.
              In the combined approach, the leader uses techniques from both the directive and nondirective approaches,
              adjusting them to articulate what is best for the Airman. The combined approach emphasizes the Airman‘s
              planning and decisionmaking responsibilities. With your assistance, the Airman develops a plan of action.
              Listen, suggest possible courses, and help analyze each possible solution to determine its good and bad points.
              Then help the Airman fully understand all aspects of the situation and encourage the Airman to decide which
              solution is best.

                                                                                 Airman

10.35. The Counseling Process.
        The four stages of the counseling process are: identify the need for counseling, prepare for counseling, conduct the
        counseling session, and followup.
        10.35.1. Identify the Need for Counseling.
              Conduct developmental counseling whenever the need arises for focused, two-way communication aimed at
              Airman development. Developing Airmen consists of observing their performance, comparing it to the standard,
              and then providing them feedback in the form of counseling.
        10.35.2. Prepare for Counseling.
              Successful counseling requires preparation. To prepare for counseling:
AFPAM36-2241     1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                        237

          10.35.2.1. Select a Suitable Place. When scheduling counseling, consider an environment with minimal
          interruptions and free from distractions.
          10.35.2.2. Schedule the Time. When possible, counsel an Airman during the duty day. Counseling after duty
          hours may be rushed or perceived as unfavorable. The length of time required for counseling depends on the
          complexity of the issue. Generally, a counseling session should last less than 1 hour. If you need more time,
          schedule a second session.
          10.35.2.3. Notify the Airman Well in Advance. The Airman should know why, where, and when the
          counseling session will take place. Counseling following a specific event should happen as close to the event as
          possible.
          10.35.2.4. Organize the Pertinent Information. Solid preparation is essential to effective counseling. Review
          all pertinent information including the purpose of the counseling, facts and observations about the Airman,
          identification of possible problems, main points of discussion, and the development of a plan of action. Focus
          on specific and objective behaviors the Airman must maintain or improve upon as well as a plan of action with
          clear, obtainable goals.
          10.35.2.5. Plan the Counseling Approach. There are as many approaches to counseling as there are leaders.
          The directive, nondirective, and combined approaches to counseling were addressed earlier. Use a strategy that
          suits the Airman and the situation.
          10.35.2.6. Establish the Right Atmosphere. The right atmosphere promotes two-way communication between
          a leader and Airman. To establish a relaxed atmosphere, offer the Airman a seat or something to drink. Sit in a
          chair facing the Airman rather than behind a desk because a desk can be perceived as a barrier. Some situations,
          however, make an informal atmosphere inappropriate. For example, a more formal atmosphere is normally used
          to give specific guidance and reinforces the leader‘s rank, position, and authority.
    10.35.3. Conduct the Counseling Session.
          Be flexible when conducting a counseling session. Often, counseling for a specific incident occurs
          spontaneously as leaders encounter Airmen in their daily activities. Good leaders take advantage of naturally
          occurring events to provide Airmen with feedback. Even when you have not prepared for formal counseling,
          you should follow the four basic components of a counseling session:
          10.35.3.1. Open the Counseling Session. The best way to open a counseling session is to clearly state its
          purpose. Establish the preferred setting early in the session by inviting the Airman to speak.
          10.35.3.2. Discuss the Issues. Attempt to develop a mutual understanding of the issues with the Airman. This is
          best developed by letting the Airman do most of the talking. Use active listening; respond and question without
          dominating the conversation. Aim to help the Airman better understand the subject of the counseling, such as
          duty performance, a problem situation and its impact, or potential areas for growth. Both you and the Airman
          should provide examples or cite specific observations to reduce the perception that is unnecessarily biased or
          judgmental. However, when the issue is substandard performance, make it clear how the performance did not
          meet the standard and then develop a plan of action.
          10.35.3.3. Develop a Plan of Action. A plan of action identifies a method for achieving a desired result and
          specifies what the Airman must do to reach the goals set during the counseling session. The plan of action must
          be specific. It should show the Airman how to modify or maintain his or her behavior.
          10.35.3.4. Record and Close the Session. Documentation serves as a reference to the agreed-upon plan of
          action and the Airman‘s accomplishments, improvements, personal preferences, or problems. To close the
          session, summarize key points and ask if the Airman understands the plan of action. Invite the Airman to review
          the plan of action and what you, as the leader, expect from him or her. With the Airman, establish any followup
          measures necessary to support the successful implementation of the plan of action. These may include providing
          the Airman with resources and time, periodically assessing the plan, and following through on referrals.
          Schedule any future meetings, at least tentatively, before dismissing the Airman.
    10.35.4. Followup.
          The counseling process does not end with the counseling session. Followup continues through implementation
          of the plan of action and evaluation of results. After counseling, support the Airman as he or she implements the
          plan of action. Support may include teaching, coaching, or providing time and resources. Observe and assess
          this process and possibly modify the plan to meet its goals. Appropriate measures after counseling include
          followup counseling, making referrals, informing the chain of command, and taking corrective measures.

10.36. Leveraging Diversity.
      Our work environment today is more diverse than ever. The Air Force team is comprised of military, civilians, and
      contractors. Leaders can find themselves dealing with a workforce ranging from 18-year-olds to those with 18 or more
      years of experience. The challenge is to incorporate everyone‘s specific talents into a cohesive and optimal workforce.
      We must recognize that people are vital to an organization‘s success. Consequently, we need to understand the
      motivations and interests of this diverse workforce.
      10.36.1. People are motivated for their reasons, not yours. What sparks interest and passion in one person doesn‘t
      necessarily ignite the next person. Smart leaders take time to recognize what excites others and how to leverage that
      talent to the organization. Leaders need to create a work culture that recognizes and appreciates differing perspectives
      and approaches to solving problems. Consider this: The Air Force attracts people from every aspect of society, culture,
      and social status. When, where, and how someone was raised impacts their value system. None of these variables are
      under a supervisor‘s direct control. A supervisor cannot change someone‘s inherent characteristics, but can change
      how to lead the people on a team. Foremost, leaders must create a hospitable climate that promotes respect and
      inclusion. This will reduce dysfunctional tension and increase team productivity. Specifically, how can this be
      achieved?
      10.36.2. The first step in leading a diverse organization is to form common ground or a shared set of assumptions,
      which will form the framework within which we communicate. The common ground is the organization itself, the
      vision, goals, rules, regulations, processes, and procedures that govern what the unit does to achieve mission
      requirements. Clear guidelines improve communication, reduce confusion, provide purpose, and define end points. A
      team must have a clear sense of direction. The alternative is mass confusion with everyone going in different
      directions.
      10.36.3. Having established common ground, we must increase awareness and expel stereotypes. (Examples: Younger
      employees are wet behind the ears, know nothing, have no respect or loyalty, lack experience, have no credibility, and
      can‘t be trusted with much responsibility. Older employees are less motivated to work hard, are nothing but deadwood,
      resistant to change, can‘t learn new methods/technology, plateau at 40, should be fired after 50, and are ‗fire proof.‘)
      Stereotypes ignore differences among the individuals in a group. The workplace has no room for stereotypes. Instead,
      leaders must acknowledge the richness in diversity.
      10.36.4. People are different. There is no way to make them fit into a single mold, nor is there any reason to. We don‘t
      live in a world of carbon-copy people. To effectively manage a diverse workforce, we must acknowledge differences.
      We should, however, focus more on the things we have in common.
      10.36.5. Use everyone‘s experiences and background as a resource. Diversity of experience and background ensures
      diverse ways of looking at problems. Managing our workforce diversity can result in higher productivity, improved
      performance, more creativity, more innovations, and reduced stress. Giving emphasis to diversity without threatening
      our unity is the proper way to strengthen the ties that bind the team together. Sensitivity, mutual respect, and common
      trust coupled with communication are the prime ingredients to integrating our Airmen.
      10.36.6. Former CSAF, General John P. Jumper stated, ―Air Force diversity is a critical warfighting and readiness
      issue. Maximizing the benefits of diversity is a mission imperative. We expect Air Force leaders to challenge any
      policy, practice, or process that limits the growth and development of potential leaders from all groups.‖ Industry
      studies have consistently revealed that heterogeneous or diverse groups are more innovative than homogeneous groups
      because they view improvement opportunities from multiple perspectives. Managing diversity is determining which
      differences matter in enriching a product or service. Productivity is an outcome of respect and inclusion. Former
      CSAF, General Ronald Fogelman said, ―People are the assets that determine our success or failure. If you are to be a
      good leader, you have to cultivate your skills in the arena of personal relations.‖ The skilled leader deals effectively
      with all races, nationalities, cultures, disabilities, ages, and gender.

Section 10F—Full Range Leadership Development (FRLD)
10.37. Full Range Leadership.
      A full range of leadership behaviors is essential in today‘s complex world. Therefore, developing full range leadership
      potential throughout the workforce has become a principal initiative in several of today‘s most successful
      organizations, to include the United States Air Force. Though the leadership theories of the past were very successful,
      today‘s Air Force depends on highly effective Airmen with the flexibility and capability to operate throughout a
      spectrum of leadership styles. FRLD was adopted because it combined the best parts of past leadership theories.
      10.37.1. FRLD is unique. It requires us to view leadership as a system made up of three core elements: the leader, the
      follower, and the situation. The components of the FRLD system are interdependent of one another. Its success relies
AFPAM36-2241     1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                         239

    not only on the leader‘s actions, but also the follower and the situation. FRLD requires today‘s leaders to consider the
    follower and each situation and be willing to:
          10.37.1.1. Develop relationships with leadership, peers, and subordinates.
          10.37.1.2. Take advantage of opportunities as they come available.
          10.37.1.3. Efficiently use available resources.
          10.37.1.4. Properly evaluate situations and the performance of followers.
          10.37.1.5. Reward appropriately (and discipline accordingly).
           10.37.1.6. Identify improvement areas in one‘s self, their followers, and the work place.
    10.37.2. The FRLD model (Figure 10.4) includes five leadership behaviors ranging from the passive, less effective
    Laissez-Faire behavior to the more active and effective transformational leadership behavior.

                                              Ineffective


          10.37.2.1. Laissez-Faire. Laissez-faire leaders view the development and needs of their subordinates as
          someone else‘s concern. They tend to pass on and abandon their responsibilities and remain indifferent toward
          important issues. They are hesitant to make decisions and are usually absent from their place of work, which
          negatively affects relationships with peers and subordinates.
          10.37.2.2. Management by Exception-Passive. This leadership behavior is the ―if it ain‘t broke, don‘t fix it‖
          leadership style. Here, leaders elect to sit back, observe, and wait for things to go wrong before taking action.
          They intervene only when policies or rules are broken. Management by Exception-Passive is a little more
          effective than Laissez-Faire because subordinates know that leadership will hold them accountable if they fail to
          meet standards of performance or comply with policies and procedures.
          10.37.2.3. Management by Exception-Active. This leadership behavior ensures leaders keep personnel and
          processes in control. They monitor and govern subordinates through forced compliance with rules, regulations,
          and expectations for meeting performance standards. Management by Exception-Active exists in a structured
          system with detailed instructions, careful observation, and very active supervision. Furthermore, it reduces
          organizational uncertainties, avoids unnecessary risks, and ensures important goals are being achieved. It also
          reduces the temptation for employees to avoid their duties or act unethically and aids members in meeting
          defined performance objectives.
240                                                                                   1 OCTOBER 2013           AFPAM36-2241
            10.37.2.4. Transactional Leadership and Contingent Rewards. Transactional leadership and contingent
            rewards involve the constructive transaction between a leader and his or her followers. These transactions are
            ―contracts‖ where the leader sets goals, identifies ways for the subordinate to reach these goals, and supports the
            follower along the way. The follower is then required to perform their assigned tasks to a specified performance
            level and, when they achieve their leader‘s expectations, the leader reinforces the positive behavior by
            providing a reward. In other words, the reward is contingent upon the follower performing assigned tasks to
            expectations.
            10.37.2.5. Transformational Leadership. The transformational leader offers followers a vision and inspires
            their mission. This type of leadership inspires followers to exceed their goals and promotes positive, meaningful
            changes. There are four components of transformational leadership, called the ―4 Is‖: Individualized
            Consideration, Intellectual Stimulation, Idealized Influence, and Inspirational Motivation.
            10.37.2.5.1. Individualized Consideration (Nurturing). Individualized consideration is where leaders treat
            their followers as individuals with different needs, abilities, and aspirations and not just as a part of a group of
            subordinates. They empathize with and support each follower while maintaining healthy communication. Using
            Individualized Consideration, leaders ‗nurture‘ followers by acting as mentor or coaches.
            10.37.2.5.2. Intellectual Stimulation (Thinking). Intellectual Stimulation is the degree to which a leader values
            their subordinates‘ rationality and intellect, seeking different perspectives and considering opposing points of
            view. Using Intellectual Stimulation, leaders stimulate and encourage creativity in their followers, encourage
            followers to be independent thinkers, and are not afraid to take risks and solicit ideas from their followers.
            10.37.2.5.3. Inspirational Motivation (Charming). This leader behavior involves developing and articulating
            visions that paint an optimistic and enthusiastic picture of the future that is appealing and inspiring to followers.
            These visions elevate performance expectations and inspire followers to put forth extra effort to achieve the
            leader‘s vision.
            10.37.2.5.4. Idealized Influence (Influencing). Transformational leaders are charismatic and act as positive
            role models that ―walk the walk‖. They exhibit high levels of moral behavior, virtues, and character strengths,
            as well as a strong work ethic. They represent the organization‘s values, beliefs, and purpose in both words and
            actions. They set aside personal interests for the sake of the group.
      10.37.3. Developing these five leadership behaviors begins by understanding each of them and knowing when, or
      when not, to apply them. In addition, possessing the flexibility and capability to implement each style is critical to
      successfully leading others, depending on the follower and the situation. Though a more passive approach may be
      appropriate at times, transformational leaders actively and effectively develop the followers today to become the
      leaders of tomorrow.

Section 10G—Mentorship
10.38. Essential Principles:
      10.38.1. Mentoring is a leadership obligation and responsibility. Through mentoring, senior leaders pass on their
      experience and wisdom to junior members as well as philosophy, traditions, shared values, quality, and lessons
      learned. Mentoring provides the framework for the professional development of competent, future Air Force leaders.
      Mentoring is an ongoing process and perhaps the most powerful method leadership can use to shape the future. A
      mentor is a trusted advisor, teacher, counselor, friend, parent, and/or the more senior person in the relationship. In
      organizations, mentorship can apply to all leaders and supervisors who are responsible for getting their work done
      through other people. The assisted individual is usually referred to as the protégé: a student or pupil who learns from
      the mentor. Understanding mentoring principles is essential to practical implementation.
10.39. The Mentoring Process.                                                                Figure 10.5. Mentoring Model.
      The mnemonic at Figure 10.5 demonstrates the concepts of effective                                Model
      mentoring. (Mnemonics are memory aids that help us remember the various                           Empathize
      aspects of a concept. The elements of effective mentoring, expressed as                           Nurture
      verbs, correspond to the letters in the word itself.) The following paragraphs                    Teach
      describe each element and clarify what it means to be a mentor.                                   Organize
      10.39.1. Model.                                                                                   Respond
                                                                                                        Inspire
             An effective mentor must first lead by example. When serving as a role                     Network
             model, make no mistake that actions speak much louder than words.                          Goal-set
             Mentoring requires the mentor and protégé to spend a significant
             amount of time together. Here, the protégé is constantly observing and
             learning from the mentor‘s words and actions. The opportunity to see how the mentor deals with a variety of
             situations is an important part of the process. Therefore, the mentor must show the protégé how a mature
             professional handles various challenges and opportunities. In turn, protégés must be willing to learn, seek
             assistance, and apply what they have learned.
      10.39.2. Empathize.
             Mentoring involves much more than merely teaching. Mentors must empathize, showing genuine compassion
             for their protégés. Mentors who remember what it was like when they were new and inexperienced are more
             effective in assisting others in their professional development. Empathy cultivates strong bonds between
             mentors and protégés and fosters the mutual commitment that exemplifies mentoring at its best.
      10.39.3. Nurture.
             Nurturing also emphasizes a caring attitude. Like a farmer and his or her crops, the mentor nurtures the protégé.
             One cannot expect to sow a rich crop without investing ample time, patience, and labor. Certainly these points
             seem rather obvious, but are often the most neglected elements. Some mentors often find themselves too busy to
             provide the time and effort it takes to effectively mentor their protégés. Therefore, we must not expect an
             expert-level performance from someone who has not received appropriate amounts of attention, training, and
             time from a mentor. Remember, it takes time for people to apply, internalize, and value what they have learned.
      10.39.4. Teach.
             Many people, regardless of their knowledge and experience level, find teaching uncomfortable and extremely
             stressful. Thankfully, some time-tested methods provide a solid benchmark for instruction. Consider these five
             simple steps when teaching and training protégés: (1) organize the material into logical, systematic, units of
             manageable size; (2) correct errors immediately; (3) frequently review previously covered material and relate it
             to the current lesson; (4) include practical exercises to help the protégé exercise the newfound knowledge; and
             (5) evaluate the protégés‘ comprehension often, formally and informally, and provide detailed feedback on their
             progress.
      10.39.5. Organize.
             Mentors must first be organized before helping others become organized. Hence, a systematic, methodical
             approach is essential. An organized mentor knows from the very beginning what he or she wants to achieve,
             focusing every aspect of the process on this goal. The time and effort spent organizing thoughts and materials
             into a logical, building-block sequential plan of lessons aimed at a precisely defined target pays big dividends in
             the form of improved learning and developmental experiences for the protégé.
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                           243

      10.39.6. Respond.
            Mentoring is a two-way communication process that requires mentors to actively listen to the protégés‘
            questions and provide useful and timely responses. There may be times when the protégé is reluctant to ask a
            particular question. Therefore, effective mentors must remain alert to recognize nonverbal behaviors and subtle
            communication cues. Rather than sitting back and waiting for the protégé to ask questions, be proactive.
            Anticipate the needs, problems, and concerns of protégés and take care of them immediately.
      10.39.7. Inspire.
            A mentor should be more than just a good role model, teacher, or helpful acquaintance. Genuine mentoring
            encompasses an element of inspiration. Inspirational mentors have a profound impact on their protégés that
            encourages them to transform into a more improved being. Inspiration is one of the characteristics that
            distinguishes leaders from managers. The best mentors most likely become the best leaders because they are
            able to inspire others.
      10.39.8. Network.
            A good mentor introduces and ―connects‖ a protégé to other people who can also provide guidance, support,
            resources, and opportunities. Networking is a vital function that provides protégés a ―head start‖ on establishing
            themselves in their professional community. Building a solid network of friends, acquaintances, and associates
            takes time; the earlier a protégé can cultivate this, the better.
      10.39.9. Goal-Set.
            Many young, inexperienced people do not understand the importance of setting goals. Oftentimes, they lack the
            expertise to establish specific, achievable, and realistic goals. Therefore, mentors must help their protégés
            understand why goals are important; establish short- and long-term goals that are specific, achievable, and
            realistic; and be available to assist them in achieving their goals.

Section 10H—Conflict Management
10.40. Introduction.
      Conflict is inevitable in every organization, and is oftentimes necessary to reach high levels of performance. Dr.
      Kenneth Thomas, author of Conflict and Conflict Management, the Handbook of Industrial and Organization
      Psychology (1976), defines conflict as the ―process that results when one person (or a group) perceives that another
      person or group is frustrating, or about to frustrate, an important concern.‖ Conflict involves incompatible differences
      between parties that result in interference or opposition. Such differences can motivate for positive change or decrease
      productivity.
      10.40.1. Destructive Versus Constructive Conflict.
            Conflict can be constructive or destructive. It becomes destructive when it results in ―barriers‖ to cooperation
            and communication. This destroys morale and diverts energy away from important tasks and initiatives. On the
            other hand, conflict can be constructive when managed effectively. Positive conflict results in problem
            solutions, greater understanding, and enhanced communication between individuals or groups. In the past,
            managers were trained to avoid conflict because of its negative repercussions. This continues to challenge
            managers today as they work feverishly to avoid it altogether. However, managing conflict effectively offers
            benefits to the organization like reducing organizational chaos and stimulating work activity and productivity.
            Therefore, to manage conflict successfully, we must first understand some of the sources of conflict.
      10.40.2. Sources of Conflict.
            Many factors may result in or increase the probability of conflict within an organization. These factors manifest
            themselves in combination with other factors, making it potentially difficult to identify the specific source of the
            conflict. Many researchers, however, agree that conflict originates with one or more of the following stimulants:
            10.40.2.1. Communication Factors. We often hear that many problems occur due to a failure in, or a lack of,
            communication. However, on closer examination, this usually accounts for a very small portion of the conflicts
            reported. The real crux of the problem is miscommunication; for example, when communication is
            misinterpreted, inaccurate, or incomplete. For personnel to perform at their very best, they need constructive,
            comprehensible, and accurate information; anything less results in frustration, stress, and failure. Remember,
            conflict is defined as frustration of an important concern, whether real or perceived. Consider your organization
244                                                                                  1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
            and the conflicts that erupted because of poor communication. Now consider what happens when the
            communication process fails altogether. Did the outcomes result in conflict?
            10.40.2.2. Structural Factors:
            10.40.2.2.1. Size. Research shows that organizational size affects the people who work there. Like an elevator
            that reaches its maximum capacity, the larger the organization, the more people there is to cause and participate
            in conflict. With more personnel comes more opinions, perspectives, perceptions, etc. As a result, larger
            organizations may have unclear goals, more rigid structures, increased specialization, more levels of
            supervision, and increased opportunities for information to become distorted as it passes through each
            organizational echelon.
            10.40.2.2.2. Participation:
            10.40.2.2.2.1. The more people interact and participate, the more noticeable their differences become. This can
            also lead to disputes and conflict, partly because although people may attempt to participate does not
            necessarily mean their ideas are heard or accepted. This rejection can spark frustration and conflict among
            members. However, this situation also has the potential to increase productivity if workers become more
            creative or competitive and search for better ways to enhance overall unit performance. This is productive
            conflict versus destructive conflict.
            10.40.2.2.2.2. We want people to challenge the status quo, to seek better ways to do business, and to continually
            improve processes. This supports our core value, excellence in all we do. Such efforts also support our service
            before self core value in that we must be willing to set aside old ways and personal differences in order to listen
            to the ideas of others, to include our newest Airman. We must be willing to change, put self-interests aside, and
            do what is right for the Air Force.
            10.40.2.3. Line-Staff Distinctions. Diverse background and roles can create conflict. According to Dr. Thomas,
            this is very noticeable in the line and staff functions because the roles are so different. Overall, line personnel
            are concerned with production and are usually more loyal to the company. Staff functions usually involve
            creativity; therefore, staff personnel are usually more critical of the organization. Moreover, since there are
            usually different requirements for staff and line functions, there are different types of backgrounds for each.
            These differences in values, training, background, etc., can lead to conflict. Consider how line and staff
            personnel view organizational goals. Line personnel normally are more concerned with the immediate or short-
            range goals, whereas staff personnel are more concerned with long-range or strategic goals. These differences in
            background and viewpoints can trigger conflict.
            10.40.2.4. Rewards. Earning rewards involves a level of competition, which can lead to conflict. Healthy
            competition is not the problem. However, the individuals and groups who perceive that the rewards were given
            unfairly or in favor of someone else can often lead to conflict. For example, one person or department receives
            recognition that others feel they deserved but did not receive.
            10.40.2.5. Resource Interdependence. Most likely, we have all had to compete for resources at one time or
            another. When people compete for scarce resources and each party feels they have a greater need, conflict may
            arise. Oftentimes, negotiations fail as each party assumes a directive, or authoritarian position as they compete
            for the resource.
      10.40.3. Personal Behavior Factors.
            Conflict can arise because of individual differences, such as goals and objectives, perceptions, values, and
            personalities. Three such differences in particular may facilitate behaviors that cause conflict: values,
            perception, and personality.
            10.40.3.1. Values. Values are very important to people and will determine their behavior. When people‘s values
            are questioned, criticized, or opposed, conflict can result. Some values, such as religion and politics, seem to
            incite the biggest arguments and can lead to fights, but even less emotion-based values can cause conflict. For
            example, a worker who values high quality work may see him or herself due a reward for the quality of the
            work. Conflict may occur if the unit emphasizes quantity over quality and rewards someone else instead.
            10.40.3.2. Perception. Values also affect how people perceive situations and other people. If a person perceives
            others as lazy and incompetent, how he or she responds to that perception may cause problems. A person‘s
            perception of what constitutes fairness, quality of work, or constructive techniques can lead to conflict if these
            perceptions differ significantly from others or what the organization has defined for those factors.
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                            245

            10.40.3.3. Personality. We have all heard about people who couldn‘t get along because of a personality
            conflict. It isn‘t uncommon. Put certain personalities together and you are asking for conflict. Two personality
            types especially conflict-prone are the highly authoritarian individual and the low self-esteem individual. The
            highly authoritarian personality may antagonize coworkers by escalating otherwise trivial differences. The low
            self-esteem personality may feel threatened by others and therefore overreact. Either type of behavior can create
            interpersonal conflict in an organization.
10.41. Five Styles of Conflict Management:
      10.41.1. Now that we have an idea of what conflict is and what causes it, we can examine some ways to manage it. In
      the book, ―Conflict and Negotiation Processes in Organizations,‖ Handbook of Industrial and Organizational
      Psychology (1992), Dr. Thomas suggests five major conflict management styles: competing (or forcing), collaborating,
      accommodating, avoiding, and compromising. Dr. Thomas uses a two-dimensional framework to compare these
      styles. The first dimension refers to the degree of cooperation a manager exhibits, measuring from uncooperative to
      cooperative. The second dimension measures assertiveness on a scale from nonassertive (passive) to assertive (active).
      Being cooperative refers to how willing a person or group is to satisfy the other‘s needs. For example, if Person A
      gives in the needs of Person B, Person A is considered cooperative. If Person A assumes a ―my way or the highway‖
      approach, he or she is considered uncooperative.
      10.41.2. From these two dimensions, we can devise a way to manage conflict based on the situation. Just as situational
      leadership is based on task and relationship behavior, conflict management is situational and is based on assertive and
      cooperative behavior. With this in mind, let‘s look at the five styles used to manage conflict.
            10.41.2.1. Competing (or Forcing). This style attempts to overwhelm an opponent with formal authority,
            threats, or the use of power. Its underlying features are being highly assertive and uncooperative.
            10.41.2.2. Collaborating. The collaborating style involves an attempt to satisfy the concerns of both sides
            through honest discussion. Creative approaches to conflict reduction, such as sharing resources, may actually
            lead to both parties being materially better off. For this style to be successful, trust and openness are required of
            all participants. This style is high in assertive behavior and high in cooperation. It seeks a win position for both
            groups.
            10.41.2.3. Accommodating. The accommodating style combines low assertiveness and high cooperation. At its
            simplest level, this style may merely involve giving in to another person‘s wishes.
            10.41.2.4. Avoiding:
            10.41.2.4.1. The combination of low assertiveness and low cooperation leads to an avoiding style. The person
            implies that he or she will appear to be neutral. It may not always be possible to adopt a truly neutral position,
            but a manager may nonetheless prefer to avoid the situation. Although a manager who avoids difficult issues is
            likely to be resented by his or her Airmen, this strategy may be effective under certain circumstances. For
            example, a manager may initially stay out of a disagreement to avoid escalating the conflict during a particular
            phase of its development. Later, when he or she judges the time to be right, the manager may take a more active
            role in finding a productive solution.
            10.41.2.4.2. Experienced managers recognize that action is not always necessary because some problems
            dissipate over time or are resolved by other organizational processes. For example, an intense conflict between
            two Airmen may seem to require intervention by their manager. If the manager knows that one of the
            individuals will soon be transferred to another department or promoted to another position, ignoring the
            situation and letting the impending changes resolve the difficulty may be the best solution.
            10.41.2.5. Compromising. This style involves intermediate degrees of assertiveness and cooperation to
            partially satisfy both parties‘ desires and achieve a middle ground. To successfully compromise, both parties
            must be willing to give up something. Compromising is common during labor and management disputes.
10.42. Applying Conflict Management Style:
      10.42.1. When deciding which style of conflict management to use, consider a few additional factors. First, consider
      who you are dealing with. If it is a supervisor or a peer, the competing style of conflict management may not be
      applicable. It is doubtful any of us could force our commander in a conflict situation. On the other hand, competing
      may work for a subordinate. You have the legitimate power to enforce a policy. So the who is important in deciding
      which style you can use.
      10.42.2. Another factor is determining how critical the issue is, also known as the stakes. If the issue is critical, you
      may wish to use the avoiding style at first to carefully consider the options or gather more data. However, because the
246                                                                                       1 OCTOBER 2013           AFPAM36-2241
      issue is critical, you cannot avoid it for long. Sooner or later, you will have to confront the issue. Also, if it is a critical
      situation and you know you are right, you may need to use the competing style to force your position. Conversely, if
      the issue is trivial, you could avoid it or even accommodate the other party. Remember, always consider the stakes in
      the issue.
      10.42.3. The final factor is the situation itself. In an emergency, the competing style might be necessary because there
      simply is not enough time to collaborate or compromise. You also cannot avoid an emergency. However, if time is not
      an issue and the parties are willing to discuss the matter, collaboration may be the best way to deal with the conflict
      situation because it works best for everyone.
      10.42.4. Although people may consider some styles of conflict management more effective (for example, collaborating
      versus avoiding), all of the conflict management styles are useful, depending on the who, the stakes, and the situation.
      Using these five styles allows us to successfully manage conflict, reduce disorder and chaos, and facilitate creativity
      and innovative problem solving. Being a conflict management specialist is just another one of the many
      responsibilities of managers!

      10.43.1. Contemporary motivation is a simple, three-phased approach to motivation. This approach states that people
      can be in one of three levels of commitment to the organization—the membership level (at the lowest end), the
      performance level, and the involvement level (highest level). A person‘s level of commitment determines how
      motivated he or she is to accomplish the mission. The more committed a person is to the organization, the more
      involved he or she is in the organization. Supervisors can help to ensure the proper rewards are provided so individuals
      can move to, or remain in, a higher commitment level.
      10.43.2. Are methods available to measure unit morale or motivation levels? Yes. For instance, the Inspector General
      uses a climate assessment instrument to assess a unit‘s morale. Mark Alexander, author of the article, Organizational
      Norms, The 1977 Annual Handbook for Group Facilitators (1977), defines a set of organizational norms and
      maintains that identifying and evaluating organizational norms will result in a morale score. He identified 10 norms,
      but we will only examine 7. Paragraph 10.44 is an excerpt from the article and norms survey.
10.44. Organizational Norms.
      Within any organizational situation, behavioral forces influence individual effectiveness and job satisfaction. To a
      certain extent, these forces are a result of organization requirements that people behave and act in certain ways, that
      they hold certain values and sentiments, and that they interact with others in a particular manner.
      10.44.1. Required and Emergent Behavior.
             An organization‘s required behavior, sentiments, and interactions are not necessarily in effect. Existent or
             emergent behaviors, sentiments, and interactions, in many cases, have a much greater influence on organization
             life than required behavior. Emergent behavior correspondingly affects productivity, individual satisfaction, and
             personal development. Behavioral scientists generally recognize that emergent organizational behavior is
             determined largely by formation of working group behavioral norms.
             10.44.1.1. Norms are desirable behaviors. They are considered acceptable behavior as prescribed by work
             groups and, in the larger context, by society and its institutions. There are numerous examples throughout work
             and everyday life of emergent behavior and the underlying norms that cause this behavior.
             10.44.1.2. In the work environment, a tendency to establish start and quit times that vary from company policy,
             or a work group‘s inclination to establish a quicker or slower pace than required are two often-cited examples.
             Outside the work situation, normative (or emergent) behavior also occurs, and can be observed in schools,
             institutions, or anywhere that people come together and interact for a period of time.
      10.44.2. Positive or Negative Norms.
             From the organization‘s view, norms can be positive or negative. Recent studies on organizational norms
             indicate that they can be broken into categories and that certain types or clusters of positive or negative norms
             can exist in a given work situation.
             10.44.2.1. Positive norms are those that support the organization‘s goals and objectives and foster behavior
             directed toward achieving those goals. Norms that support hard work, loyalty, quality, and concern for customer
             satisfaction are examples of positive norms.
AFPAM36-2241      1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                         247

           10.44.2.2. Negative norms have just the opposite effect. They promote behavior that works to prevent the
           organization from achieving its objectives. Negative norms are those that sanction criticism of the company,
           theft, absenteeism, and low levels of productivity.
10.45. Norm Categories:
     10.45.1. Organizational and Personal Pride.
           Norms in this category are associated with an individual‘s feelings of identification and sense of pride regarding
           the organization. Positive norms lead the person to see the organization as ―his‖ or ―hers.‖ Negative norms are
           reflected in a ―we‖ and ―they‖ attitude toward the organization and its goals. Examples of positive and negative
           organizational and personal pride norms are evident in the competition between military organizations. If
           competition helps the units become better at their missions and exhibit greater morale and motivation, it is
           positive. On the other hand, if it hampers the mission and leads to reduced morale and motivation, it‘s negative.
     10.45.2. Teamwork and Communication.
           These norms are reflected in the visible behaviors where individuals work together (cooperate). Negative norms
           foster individuality, secrecy, and the belief that success is achieved by an attitude of ―every man for himself.‖
           Positive norms promote sharing of information and working together to achieve common goals. Thomas
           Jefferson noted that a candle loses nothing when it lights another candle; that is the real nature of partnership
           and teamwork: give freely of yourself and you will be rewarded with abundance. Promoting a positive norm is
           even more critical as all military branches and government agencies work together to counter global threats and
           combat terrorism at home and abroad.
     10.45.3. Leadership and Supervision.
           Leadership norms can enhance or hinder effective supervision. Negative norms cause supervisors to assume
           more active roles, like constantly policing and monitoring Airmen. Positive norms result in supervisors
           assuming the role of subordinate helpers, trainers, and developers.
     10.45.4. Profitability and Cost Effectiveness.
           This group of norms determines people‘s behavior with respect to profit and cost consciousness. Positive norms
           encourage people to save money and reduce costs; negative norms foster a lack of concern for bottom line
           performance. You may have heard someone say ―it‘s good enough for government work.‖ That is a negative
           norm that has been perpetuated over the years, but it is one our Air Force cannot afford if we are to effectively
           accomplish our mission of defending the United States and protecting its interests through superior air and
           space power.
     10.45.5. Customer Relations.
           Norms in this group result in individual behavior that affects the manner in which a customer is served. Positive
           norms are directed toward maximizing customer satisfaction. Negative norms lead to viewing the customer as
           an obstacle to be avoided. Air Force basic doctrine tells us the Air Force‘s air and space core competencies are
           recognized by our joint ―customers.‖ In other words, the total force, joint force, North Atlantic Treaty
           Organization and others rely on us to do our job to the best of our ability. If we do not, we cannot fight and win
           our Nation‘s wars as we are expected to. Therefore, each organization must cultivate a culture that helps our
           Airmen, soldiers, marines, and sailors develop a positive customer relations norm to ensure our Nation can meet
           any challenge in the most effective manner.
     10.45.6. Innovativeness and Creativity.
           This group of norms determines, to a large degree, whether original and creative behaviors are supported and
           encouraged. Positive norms lead to the stimulation of new ideas and to positive change. Negative norms support
           the status quo and discourage experimentation. In today‘s total and joint forces environment, we must
           encourage everyone to bring innovativeness and creativity to the table in order to meet the dynamic threats that
           terrorism has brought to our shores.
     10.45.7. Training and Development.
           Positive norms in this group encourage training and view development as essential to the ongoing operation.
           Negative norms treat development as a nonessential, nice-to-do, but not critical aspect of the operation. We saw
           firsthand during Hurricane Katrina that training is vitally important to the Department of Homeland Security,
           the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and other natural disaster
248                                                                                    1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
            responders. In addition, Airmen are constantly training with soldiers and marines to ensure each branch is better
            equipped and prepared to fight the global war on terrorism.
10.46. Why We Measure Norms:
      10.46.1. Understanding that norms exist, that they can be either positive (supportive of organizational goals) or
      negative (incongruent with organizational goals), and that they can be categorized drives the need to measure those
      norms and develop a normative profile.
      10.46.2. In effect, a normative profile is a statement of organizational strengths and weaknesses on a behavioral level.
      Understanding their impact on an organization‘s ability to achieve its goals, you should direct improvement programs
      toward changing work group norms rather than individual behavior (as is so often the case with organizations‘
      development programs). Once norms change, behavioral change should follow. If a military member‘s behavior does
      not support positive organizational norms, the supervisor needs to determine the underlying reasons. The individual‘s
      behavior could be a result of unmet needs, a result of discipline problems, or both. In order to be effective operational
      managers and expeditionary leaders, supervisors must learn to instill positive norms to properly motivate and
      discipline Airmen.
Section 10J—Strategic Leadership
10.47. Definition of Strategic Leadership.
      Strategic leadership plays a critical role in propelling today‘s Air Force through and beyond the 21st century. We may
      not be able to define specifically what strategic leadership is because it is such a broad concept, but we can certainly
      recognize it in action. Noel Tichy, Director of the Global Leadership Program at the Ross School of Business, offers a
      comprehensible depiction as to what a strategic leader is:
            ―Strategic leaders guide the achievement of their organizational vision within a larger enterprise by
            directing policy and strategy, building consensus, acquiring and allocating resources, influencing
            organizational culture, and shaping complex and ambiguous external environments. They lead by
            example to build effective organizations, grow the next generation of leaders, energize subordinates,
            seek opportunities to advance organizational goals, and balance personal and professional
            demands.‖
10.48. Components of Strategic Leadership:
      10.48.1. Enlisted leaders apply the strategic leadership components of core values, competencies, and actions at the
      tactical, operational, and strategic levels every day. Leadership at the tactical level is predominantly direct and face-to-
      face. As leaders ascend the organizational ladder to the operational level, leadership responsibilities become more
      complex and sophisticated. Strategic leaders have a responsibility to large organizations and systems and are expected
      to conceptualize and integrate a variety of issues to accomplish the mission.
      10.48.2. Core values form the foundation of leadership (paragraph 10.12), coupled with competencies (personal,
      people/team, and institutional leadership) and actions. Personal leadership focuses on interpersonal relations that
      directly influence human behavior and values. People/team leadership involves more interpersonal relations and team
      relationships. Leaders using this competency tailor resources to organizations and programs. Institutional leadership is
      about establishing structure, allocating resources appropriately, and articulating the organizational vision.
      10.48.3. Actions include training and educational activities designed to develop strategic leadership abilities. Early
      career development focuses on personal competencies at the tactical level. At the operational stage, personal
      leadership continues, but the Air Force begins to emphasize people/team leadership development and introduces
      institutional leadership competencies. At the strategic level, the greatest emphasis is on developing institutional
      leadership competencies, primarily through education designed to help leaders form accurate frames of reference,
      make sound decisions, uncover underlying connections between general issues, and think creatively, innovatively, and
      critically about new solutions and options.
10.49. Strategic Leadership:
      10.49.1. At the strategic level, Airmen must combine highly developed occupational capabilities with competencies
      gained earlier in their careers to lead and direct exceptionally complex and multi-tiered organizations. Strategic leaders
      must understand Air Force missions and how operational capabilities and Airmen are integrated to achieve synergistic
      results and desired effects. Strategic leaders are also expected to demonstrate a highly developed and insightful
      understanding of personal and team leadership.
AFPAM36-2241         1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                         249

      10.49.2. The successful strategic leader is the quintessential communicator, using all means of communication.
      Whereas leaders at lower levels of the organization remain focused on the short term, strategic leaders must have a
      future focus, spending much of their time looking forward, positioning the organization for long-term success.
      10.49.3. Strategic leaders seek education and other opportunities to enhance their understanding and appreciation of
      strategic leadership, its responsibilities, functions, and impact on the organization. They fully understand their role in
      shaping climate and culture through vision, policy, communication, education, coaching, mentoring, and personal
      example.
10.50. Conclusion.
      To lead means to act as a guide or to guide; a leader is defined as ―a person who leads, directs, commands, or guides a
      group or activity.‖ These are simple definitions, but the implications of poor or ineffective leadership are devastating
      to mission success. Given the authority, anyone can command. Leading, however, is a delicate art calling for people-
      oriented attributes that many find difficult to develop and impossible to acquire. With determination and practical
      experience, you can develop your leadership skill sets. Commanders depend on noncommissioned officers to lead
      Airmen and accomplish the mission. This chapter discussed the art of leadership, effective leadership, interrelationship
      of leadership and management, leadership qualities, and the concept of vision, and provided an overview on
      empowerment and learning. It also provided information on leadership flexibility and followership, dealing effectively
      with change, the critical relationship between leadership and core values, mentoring, and counseling. These concepts
      are fundamental to the mission of the Air Force, as well as the careers and futures of the enlisted force.

                                     THE ENLISTED EVALUATION SYSTEM (EES)

          Organization doesn‘t really accomplish anything. Plans don‘t accomplish anything, either. Theories of
          management don‘t much matter. Endeavors succeed or fail because of the people involved. Only by
          attracting the best people will you accomplish great deeds.
                                                                    General Colin Powell
                                                                    Former Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff
Section 11A—Overview
11.1. Introduction:
      11.1.1. The EES deals directly with the Air Force‘s most precious resource—people. Supervisors must help their
      subordinates understand their strengths and weaknesses and how their efforts contribute to the mission. Supervisors
      employ the EES in everyday situations to help develop their subordinates. This chapter addresses the importance of
      correctly using the EES, identifies responsibilities, discusses the performance feedback process, and provides
      information on the enlisted performance report (EPR).
      11.1.2. The EES provides:
               11.1.2.1. Meaningful feedback to individuals pertaining to what is expected of them, advice on how well they
               are meeting expectations, and advice on how to better meet these expectations.
               11.1.2.2. A reliable, long-term, cumulative record of performance and potential based on performance.
               11.1.2.3. Sound information pertaining to senior noncommissioned officer (SNCO) evaluation boards, the
               Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS), and other personnel managers to assist in identifying the best
               qualified enlisted personnel for advancement and increased responsibility.

Section 11B—Individual Responsibilities
11.2. Ratee.
      The ratee must know their rating chain and when feedback sessions are due; request a feedback session, if needed; and
      notify the rater and other evaluators in the chain, if necessary, when a required or requested feedback session does not
      take place.
      11.2.1. Self-reporting.
               All Airmen above the pay grade of E-6 are required to report information about civilian offenses to their
               supervisors (Reference: National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2006, Public Law 109-
               163, 554, 119 Statue 3136, 3264-65). For purposes of this policy this includes a plea or finding of guilty, a plea
               of nolo contendere (no contest), and all other actions tantamount to finding of guilty, including adjudication
               withheld, deferred prosecution, entry into adult or juvenile pretrial intervention programs, and any similar
               disposition of charges. In addition, this includes any military or Federal criminal law; any State, district,
               commonwealth, or territorial or equivalent criminal law or ordinance; and any criminal law or ordinance of any
               county, parish, municipality, or local subdivision of any such authority, other than motor vehicle violations that
               do not involve a court appearance. Active duty members shall submit reports within 15 days of the date the
               conviction is announced, even if sentence has not been imposed or the member intends to appeal the conviction.
11.3. Rater.
      The rater has responsibilities both during the performance feedback process and during the performance reporting, as
      follows:
      11.3.1. Performance Feedback Process.
               Performance feedback is a private formal communication a rater uses to tell a ratee what is expected regarding
               duty performance and how well the ratee is meeting those expectations. The rater must prepare for, schedule,
               and conduct feedback sessions and provide realistic feedback to help the ratee improve performance. Realistic
               feedback includes discussing performance with the ratee and writing comments on AF Form 931, Performance
               Feedback Worksheet (AB thru TSgt), or AF Form 932, Performance Feedback Worksheet (MSgt thru CMSgt).
252                                                                                  1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
      11.3.2. Performance Reporting:
             11.3.2.1. Use AF Form 910, Enlisted Performance Report (AB thru TSgt), and AF Form 911, Enlisted
             Performance Report (MSgt thru CMSgt), to document performance.
             11.3.2.2. The rater ensures the ratee is aware of who is in his or her rating chain. (Note: A good time to do this
             is during the feedback session.) The rater must review any adverse information in the ratee‘s personnel
             information file (PIF), if applicable and any unfavorable information file (UIF) before preparing the EPR. The
             rater must assess and document the ratee‘s performance, how well he or she performed it, and the potential
             based on this performance. The rater must obtain meaningful information from the ratee and as many sources as
             possible, especially when he or she cannot observe the ratee personally. The ratee should not write or draft any
             portion of his or her own EPR; however, the ratee is encouraged to provide the rater input on specific
             accomplishments. The rater must consider the significance and frequency of incidents (including isolated
             instances of poor or outstanding performance) when assessing the total performance. The rater must record the
             ratee‘s performance, ensuring all data on the EPR matches the data on the EPR notice, and make a valid and
             realistic recommendation for promotion, if appropriate. Finally, the rater must differentiate between ratees with
             similar performance records, especially when making promotion recommendations.
11.4. Additional Rater.
      The additional rater reviews the PIF and UIF if applicable, and returns EPRs to the rater for reconsideration, if
      necessary, to ensure accurate, unbiased, and uninflated reports. The additional rater completes Section VI of the EPR
      by concurring or nonconcurring with the rater and making comments. The additional rater must be the rater‘s rater
      unless deviation from the normal rating chain is required to meet grade requirements or to accommodate unique
      organizational structures.
11.5. Reviewer/Senior Rater/Final Evaluator.
      This individual reviews the PIF and UIF if applicable, and returns EPRs to previous evaluators for reconsideration, if
      necessary, and obtains additional information from competent sources, if necessary. When appropriate, this individual
      concurs or nonconcurs with previous evaluators and makes comments. The senior rater may complete Section VII of
      EPRs for SNCOs to differentiate between individuals with similar performance records, to meet minimum grade
      requirements, when the ratee is a chief master sergeant (CMSgt) or CMSgt-selectee, or when the ratee is time in grade
      (TIG) eligible. Refer to AFI 36-2406, Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Systems, for exceptions.
11.6. Unit Commander.
      The unit commander manages the EPR program for the organization. He or she ensures EPRs accurately describe
      performance and make realistic recommendations for advancement. The commander determines the rating chain for
      assigned personnel based on Air Force and management-level policy, and ensures first-time supervisors receive
      specific, mandatory training. He or she ensures supervisors conduct performance feedback sessions as required,
      ensures the first sergeant conducts a quality force review on all EPRs, and conducts the commander‘s review. The
      commander or squadron section commander may perform many or all of these activities.
11.7. First Sergeants.
      First sergeants review all EPRs before the commander and advise him or her of quality force indicators.

Section 11C—Performance Feedback
11.8. What Is Performance Feedback?
      Performance feedback is a private, formal communication tool a rater uses to tell a ratee what is expected regarding
      duty performance and how well the ratee is meeting expectations. Feedback should explain to ratees their duty
      performance requirements and responsibilities and if they are performing as expected. As with all other types of
      communication, to be effective, duty performance feedback must be clearly stated and received. Providing feedback
      helps an individual contribute to positive communication, improve performance, and grow professionally.
11.9. Who Provides Feedback?
       The rater provides performance feedback. In most cases, the rater (usually the ratee‘s immediate supervisor) is
       responsible for the total job effort and is in the best position to observe daily duty performance. Also, the rater
       normally has the knowledge and experience necessary to discuss the Air Force‘s expectations regarding general
       military characteristics and opportunities available within the Air Force specialty (AFS). A rater may be an officer or
       noncommissioned officer (NCO) of a U.S. or foreign military service in a grade equal to or higher than the ratee, or a
       civilian (GS-5 or a comparable grade or higher) in a supervisory position higher than the ratee in the ratee‘s rating
AFPAM36-2241      1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                          253

      chain. Active duty members in the grade of senior airman (SrA) may serve as raters if they have completed Airman
      Leadership School. Performance feedback sessions are mandatory for all enlisted personnel.
11.10. When Is Feedback Given?
     Initial feedback sessions are held within 60 days of when a rater initially begins supervision. This is the ratee‘s only
     ―initial‖ feedback session until there is a change of reporting official (CRO). During the feedback session, the rater
     clearly defines the expectations for the upcoming rating period. The following paragraphs explain timing on
     performance feedback for circumstances that occur most often. This list is not all inclusive and there are exceptions for
     special circumstances. For additional information, refer to AFI 36-2406 or contact the local military personnel section
     (MPS).
     11.10.1. For airmen basic (AB) through senior master sergeants (SMSgt) who receive EPRs, a midterm feedback
     session is held midway between the date supervision began and the projected EPR closeout date to focus on how well
     the ratee meets expectations. A midterm feedback is not required for CMSgts.
     11.10.2. For Airmen who do not receive EPRs, a midterm session is due approximately 180 days after the initial
     session. This cycle should continue until there is a CRO or the Airman begins to receive EPRs.
     11.10.3. Raters conduct a feedback session for AB through technical sergeant (TSgt) when an evaluation report is
     written without a subsequent change of rater. The rater conducts the session within 60 days of the closeout of an EPR
     and uses the session to discuss performance recorded on the EPR and to provide direction and expectations for the new
     rating period.
     11.10.4. Sessions are also held if the rater determines there is a need for one, or within 30 days of a request from a
     ratee, provided that at least 60 days have passed since the last feedback session. If a CRO is expected or the projected
     EPR closeout date limits the period of supervision to less than 150 days, a feedback session should take place
     approximately 60 days before the EPR closeout.
11.11. Performance Feedback Worksheets (PFW).
     Raters document the PFW and use the PFW format as a guide for conducting feedback sessions where they discuss
     objectives, standards, behavior, and performance with the ratee. Comments are typed or handwritten. AF Form 931
     and AF Form 932 are designed to ensure that private face-to-face feedback sessions are of benefit to all enlisted
     personnel. Generally, Airmen and NCOs perform better when raters explain requirements, point out areas that need
     improvement, and keep them updated on their progress. The rater gives the completed PFW to the ratee at the
     conclusion of the feedback session and keeps a copy for personal reference. The PFW cannot be used in any personnel
     action unless the ratee first introduces it. The rater‘s rater is authorized access to the completed PFW for AB through
     TSgt; the commander is authorized access for all grades.
11.12. AF Form 931, Performance Feedback Worksheet (AB thru TSGT).
     See Figure 11.1 for a sample of this form. The form itself is just a guide. The rater‘s main goal should not be just to
     accomplish the form but to develop the ratee. Paragraph 11.12.1 through paragraph 11.12.5 provide noninclusive
     guidance for completing AF Form 931.
     11.12.1. Section I, Personal Information.
           Enter the ratee‘s name, grade, and unit assigned.
     11.12.2. Section II, Types of Feedback.
           Place an ―X‖ in the appropriate block to indicate the type of feedback being conducted (that is, initial, midterm,
           ratee requested, or rater directed).
     11.12.3. Section III, Primary Duties.
           List the major job-specific duties for which the ratee is responsible. The space provided is adequate in most
           instances. If additional space is needed, continue in Section V, Strengths, Suggested Goals, and Additional
           Comments.
     11.12.4. Section IV, Performance Feedback.
           Section IV incorporates both primary duty factors and general military factors into one major category. Primary
           duty factors relate to AFS. The rater‘s feedback is generally based on what occurs in the work environment.
           General military factors focus on characteristics considered essential to military order, image, and tradition.
           Performance feedback encompasses both of these factors to emphasize how ratees perform their particular jobs
254                                                                            1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
      and how they uphold and support the long-established military traditions, customs, standards, and institutional
      values. Primary duty and general military factors are essential considerations in determining overall duty
      performance. Also, the rater has space to add additional factors. Usually, these factors are unique to special
      duties and locations or may not be adequately covered in the primary duty or general military factors. Each
      subheading lists some behaviors that must be evaluated and scored by placing an ―X‖ in the block that most
      accurately identifies the ratee‘s performance. The areas marked ―Does Not Meet‖ or ―Meets‖ indicate the ratee
      needs to work extra hard. The areas marked ―Above Average‖ or ―Clearly Exceeds‖ indicate the member is
      performing quite well and needs to either maintain or slightly improve. Any area marked requires discussion to
      explain its exact meaning to the ratee. When the behavior listed does not apply, the rater will mark N/A
      (denotes ―not applicable‖). N/A may also be used during an initial feedback session. Remember, AF Form 931
      or 932 is a tool to help guide the session between the rater and the ratee. The most important objective is for the
      ratee to clearly understand the rater‘s position regarding performance and directions to take. Space is also
      provided to explain ideas and to give examples of behaviors noted. Provided in paragraphs 11.12.4 through
      11.12.5 are examples of the areas the rater should consider when providing feedback to the ratee.
      11.12.4.1. Primary/Additional Duties. This item focuses on the ratee‘s AFS.
      11.12.4.1.1. Quality of Work. Quality of work is the degree of job excellence. Each job normally has minimum
      quality standards established. The rater must measure the ratee‘s typical performance results against these
      standards. Jobs have different degrees of quality standards and raters have different quality thresholds.
      Nonetheless, quality of work is very important. Everyone is encouraged to strive for excellence regardless of the
      job to which they are assigned.
      11.12.4.1.2. Timeliness of Work. Timeliness of work is the final aspect of productivity. The ratee‘s awareness
      of and responses to the time constraints associated with the job are the focus of this factor. Each job has its own
      demand on time. Some jobs are planned far in advance, while others require immediate attention. Quality and
      quantity may be acceptable, but, if the job is not completed on time, the mission could suffer.
      11.12.4.1.3. Communication Skills. Good communication skills enable an Airman to listen, organize, and
      express ideas verbally and in writing.
      11.12.4.1.4. Supervision/Leadership. Supervision and leadership go hand-in-hand in the process of managing
      people and resources. Supervisors are responsible for their subordinates‘ actions and must evaluate them
      accordingly. Leaders demonstrate leadership by example to include the display of integrity, honesty, fairness,
      and concern for the health and welfare of subordinates.
      11.12.4.1.5. Technical Ability. Technical ability is the specialized knowledge and skills obtained through
      experience and training.
      11.12.4.2. Standards, Conduct, Character, and Military Bearing:
      11.12.4.2.1. Dress and Appearance. Dress and appearance is a distinction of military service. Airmen must
      reflect pride in self, unit, and the Air Force by abiding with and, hopefully, exceeding these requirements.
      11.12.4.2.2. Personal/Professional Conduct On/Off Duty. Air Force members should behave in a manner that
      supports good order and discipline. This is not a substitute for official counseling related to significant
      misconduct but a good opportunity to share general impressions and reinforce expectations. Because military
      members are on duty 24 hours a day every day, off-duty behavior simply refers to behavior that occurs away
      from the normal workplace. An Air Force member‘s conduct should be displayed in a way that reflects a
      professional image. Again, this area affords a pleasant opportunity to reinforce expectations and allows for
      comments on areas not specifically covered in other parts of the form.
      11.12.4.2.3. Enforcement of Standards. Problems occur every day in every unit. The manner and speed in
      which a supervisor solves problems become a measure of unit effectiveness. Being able to logically evaluate the
      pros and cons of each situation contributes to good problem solving. Specific examples, whether positive or
      negative, are valuable when explaining expectations versus actual performance.
      11.12.4.2.4. Customs and Courtesies. This area involves the ability to create esprit de corps, morale,
      discipline, and an atmosphere where respectful behaviors signal readiness and willingness to serve. The rater
      should discuss trends and standards.
      11.12.4.3. Fitness. Maintains Air Force Physical Fitness Standards. Being physically fit ensures mission
      readiness and an improved quality of life. It allows each Air Force member to present a proper military image.
      Additionally, being fit helps to increase mental alertness and reduce anxiety or tension.
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                         255

11.12.4.4. Training Requirements:
            11.12.4.4.1. Upgrade, Ancillary, On-the-Job Training (OJT), and Readiness. Proper training takes a lot of
            time and effort and directly determines whether an individual is successful. Raters should provide the best
            training available. An individual‘s training is rated in four categories: (1) upgrade training, (2) professional
            military education (PME), (3) proficiency and qualification training, and (4) contingency, mobility, and other
            training. Upgrade training has two components: OJT and career development courses (CDC). CDCs are
            correspondence courses written to provide information about a particular AFS. OJT is hands-on application of
            the knowledge gained through the CDCs and special instructions by the trainer. If the Airman is in upgrade
            training, feedback should focus on the Airman‘s efforts to complete the CDCs and master the hands-on
            application. Normally, training under these categories is not related to primary duties. Usually, this type of
            training is identified as training away from the job. However, raters must still present these requirements to the
            ratee with the same enthusiasm demonstrated for daily duties. Raters must also know how their people are
            doing, even when they are working under the direction of someone else.
            11.12.4.4.2. Professional Military Education. Raters must know the various PME courses available. This
            responsibility includes ensuring ratees enroll in and successfully complete any and all PME courses necessary
            for overall improvement.
            11.12.4.5. Teamwork/Followership:
            11.12.4.5.1. Teamwork and followership is the ability to create a working environment that ensures trust and
            pride in accomplishing the mission. Stimulating subordinates to willingly share their expertise with each other
            to become a cohesive team in achieving goals and expectations will have a positive impact on mission
            effectiveness.
            11.12.4.5.2. One way an organization can build a close-knit, cohesive unit is by having its members participate
            in a variety of activities both inside and outside the unit. The tone of this area is intended to be motivational.
      11.12.5. Section V, Strengths, Suggested Goals, and Additional Comments.
            The comments in this section should help explain the rater‘s thoughts. (Note: The performance assessment
            blocks in Section IV should serve as a vehicle for the ratee‘s use in remembering those areas of strength and
            those needing improvement.) Use this section to continue comments on performance factors, discuss other areas
            of interest, pinpoint strong characteristics, or outline the goals to work on until the next feedback session.
256                                                                        1 OCTOBER 2013   AFPAM36-2241

11.13. AF Form 932, Performance Feedback Worksheet (MSGT thru CMSGT).
      The purpose of AF Form 932 is to encourage the rater to provide candid comments about the SNCO‘s duty
      performance and an uninflated assessment of applicable performance factors. Several factors are common to both AF
      Forms 931 and 932. Explanations similar to those provided for the AF Form 931 are included in this paragraph for
      those who provide feedback to SNCOs only. See Figure 11.2 for an example of AF Form 932. Paragraphs 11.13.1
      through 11.13.2.7 provide noninclusive guidance for completing AF Form 932.
      11.13.1. Section I, Personal Information; Section II, Types of Feedback; Section III, Primary Duties; and
      Section V, Strengths, Suggested Goals, and Additional Comments.
            These sections have similar requirements to AF Form 931. (Refer to paragraphs 11.12 through 11.12.5 for
            additional information.) The difference between the two forms is located within Section IV.
      11.13.2. Section IV, Performance Feedback.
            The requirements for this section resemble those in Section IV of AF Form 931. Differences include the
            subheadings, which identify requirements for SNCO performance.
            11.13.2.1. Primary Duties. This item focuses on the ratee‘s AFS. Raters will place an ―X‖ in the block that
            most accurately identifies the ratee‘s performance. The areas marked ―Does Not Meet‖ or ―Meets‖ indicate the
            ratee needs to work extra hard. The areas marked ―Above Average‖ or ―Clearly Exceeds‖ indicate the member
            is performing quite well and needs to either maintain or slightly improve. Any area marked requires discussion
            to explain its exact meaning to the ratee. ―N/A‖ (not applicable) is used during an initial feedback session. In
            many cases, raters are required to establish work standards (expectations) for the unit. Usually, these standards
            are based on what needs to be accomplished, how it needs to be done, and when it needs to be completed. To
            accomplish the objectives of the unit, SNCOs are assigned specific duties. How the SNCOs accomplish these
            tasks should form the basis of the raters‘ evaluations. These factors are interrelated and sometimes difficult to
            separate. However, SNCOs must understand what it takes to achieve total job effectiveness—how they actually
            perform and meet expectations. The raters‘ thoughts on these matters form the basis of the feedback sessions.
            11.13.2.1.1. Quality of Work. The degree or grade of job excellence determines the quality of work. Normally,
            each job has minimum quality standards established. Raters should measure the SNCO‘s typical performance
            results against this standard. Obviously, some jobs have more stringent quality standards than others, and raters
            have varying tolerance in what they can accept. Quality of work is very important. The Air Force encourages
            everyone to strive for excellence regardless of the job to which they are assigned.
            11.13.2.1.2. Quantity of Work. The amount of work done is another aspect of productivity.
            11.13.2.1.3. Timeliness of Work. The final aspect of productivity is timeliness. The SNCO‘s awareness of and
            response to the time constraints associated with the job are the focus of this factor. Each job has its own demand
            on time. Some jobs are planned far in advance while others require immediate attention. While quality and
            quantity may be acceptable, the mission could suffer if the job is not completed on time.
            11.13.2.1.4. Technical Knowledge. The specialized knowledge and skills obtained through experience and
            training are called technical knowledge.
            11.13.2.1.5. Leadership. Leadership is the art of influencing and directing people to accomplish the mission. It
            involves displaying a strong desire to achieve, persistence, task competence, good interpersonal skills, self-
            confidence, decisiveness, a tolerance for stress, and a high degree of flexibility.
            11.13.2.2. Standards: Enforcement and Personal Adherence, Conduct, Military Bearing, Customs and
            Courtesies:
            11.13.2.2.1. Dress and Appearance. Dress and appearance is a distinction of military service. Everyone‘s duty
            is to ensure Airmen reflect pride in self, unit, and the Air Force by abiding with and, hopefully, exceeding these
            requirements.
            11.13.2.2.2. Personal/Professional Conduct On/Off Duty. Air Force members should behave in a manner that
            supports good order and discipline. This is not a substitute for official counseling related to significant
            misconduct, but a good opportunity to share general impressions and reinforce expectations. Because military
            members are on duty 24 hours a day every day, off-duty behavior simply refers to behavior that occurs away
            from the normal workplace. An Air Force member‘s conduct should be displayed in a way that reflects a
            professional image. Again, this area affords a pleasant opportunity to reinforce expectations and allows for
            comments on areas not specifically covered in other parts of the form.

         11.13.2.3. Fitness. Maintains Air Force Physical Fitness Standards. Being physically fit ensures mission
         readiness and an improved quality of life. It allows Air Force members to present a proper military image.
         Additionally, being fit helps to increase mental alertness and reduce anxiety or tension.
         11.13.2.4. Resource Management and Decisionmaking:
         11.13.2.4.1. Resources. The most common resources an SNCO will be involved with are people, equipment,
         and money. To effectively manage these resources is critical to the success of any mission. Planning timelines,
         programming, and projecting these resources must be done as accurately as possible.
         11.13.2.4.2. Judgment. SNCOs must be able to resolve problems in a professional manner while considering
         all factors.
         11.13.2.5. Training, Education, Off-Duty Education, PME, Professional Enhancement and
         Communication. SNCOs must know the various PME courses available. This responsibility includes ensuring
         enrollment and successful completion of any and all PME courses necessary for overall improvement. SNCOs
         must exhibit high-quality communication skills in order to perform effectively. These skills include the ability
         to listen, write, and speak well.
         11.13.2.6. Leadership/Team Building/Followership. The ability to create a working environment that ensures
         trust, teamwork, and pride in accomplishing the mission is an important part of an SNCO‘s performance. The
         art of stimulating the willingness of subordinates to share their expertise with each other to become a cohesive
         team in achieving goals and expectations will have a positive impact on mission effectiveness. One of the many
         ways a military organization can build a close-knit, cohesive unit is by its members participating in a variety of
         activities both inside and outside the unit. The tone of this area is intended to be motivational.
         11.13.2.7. Other Comments. Future duty assignments and promotion advancement can be discussed in this
         area. This section may also be used to spell out uncommon acronyms.

11.14. Helpful Hints for Effective Feedback Sessions.
      The primary purpose of feedback is to improve performance and professionally develop personnel to their highest
      potential. To enhance the effectiveness of feedback sessions:
      11.14.1. Observe Performance and Keep Notes.
            The most important aspect to consider when preparing for a feedback session is to routinely observe the ratee‘s
            performance. No one can expect to comment on strong and weak areas, trends, and any degree of improvement
            without routinely observing performance. A rater must be actively involved in the process to make feedback
            work. There is no need to follow an ―official‖ plan or create a ―fancy‖ note-taking device. However, the rater
            must routinely make notes about behavior and the impact of this behavior, collect examples of work or letters of
            appreciation, talk to others who are knowledgeable about duty performance, and actively interact with ratees.
            This information is collected over time and in a variety of circumstances to foster a solid evaluation. Whether
            the rater chooses to use a notebook or a daily calendar, reviewing performance without bias and keeping good
            notes allow for meaningful insight and help in preparing for the feedback session.
      11.14.2. Schedule the Time and Place.
            Schedule the feedback session far enough in advance so the rater and the ratee have sufficient time to prepare.
            Set aside time for the session to cover everything on the agenda without the appearance of being rushed. For
            both parties to relax and talk comfortably, select a room that allows for privacy and face-to-face discussions,
            has proper lighting and ventilation, and prevents any outside distractions or interruptions.
      11.14.3. Set the Agenda.
            The agenda should consist of a basic outline of topics and the sequence for discussion. Include the ratee‘s duty
            description and responsibilities, expectations, and target areas to meet expectations, a brief synopsis of the
            mission, and status of the unit. These essential items lay the groundwork for an effective, productive working
            relationship by motivating the ratee to achieve the highest possible level of (future) performance. Another
            important step in establishing an agenda for followup sessions is to review all notes of observed actions and
            results, the file of work samples, etc. Four basic questions to ask during a feedback session are:
            11.14.3.1. What has happened in response to the discussion from the last feedback session?
            11.14.3.2. What has been done well?
            11.14.3.3. What could be done better?
            11.14.3.4. What new areas are there to discuss?
      11.14.4. Choose the Best Approach.
            The rater can use numerous approaches to give feedback. However, regardless of the approach chosen, it must
            not be an artificial technique applied mechanically. Any one of the following approaches works well depending
            on the situation and the rater‘s judgment, but remember, one of the fundamental rules of feedback calls for the
            rater to be him or herself:
            11.14.4.1. Directive. With the directive approach, analyze the situation, develop a solution or a plan for
            improvement, and tell the Airman or NCO what to do. Several common methods of this approach include
            giving advice, explaining, and reassuring.
            11.14.4.2. Nondirective. In a nondirective approach, the rater can encourage the ratee to talk about trends by
            asking questions and drawing the Airman or NCO into the process of developing a solution. This approach is
            extremely useful with individuals who usually have a positive attitude. However, nondirective requires the rater
            to have excellent listening and questioning skills.
            11.14.4.3. Combined. This approach draws on both directive and nondirective techniques. The combined
            approach relies on both the rater and ratee to develop solutions and offers the greatest flexibility.
      11.14.5. Avoid Pitfalls:
            11.14.5.1. Problems that can arise in the course of the feedback process are as varied as the people involved in
            the process. Problems vary in degree but can happen at any time. Pitfalls include personal bias, stereotyping,
            loss of emotional control, inflexible methods, reluctance to provide feedback, and inadequate planning. Another
            example is focusing on the person instead of the behavior; for example, drawing or jumping to conclusions
            based on limited observations or poor recall, rating performance as outstanding when it is not, telling the
            individual he or she is the ―best‖ when the individual is not, and giving favorable ratings to an individual who is
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                           263

            well liked or unfavorable ratings to an individual who is not. Pitfalls always lead to a discussion of general
            impressions versus specific aspects of performance.
            11.14.5.2. Avoiding pitfalls is not easy, but two general guidelines may help. First, the rater should exhibit the
            proper attitude. The rater‘s role during feedback is not as a critic or a superior with no faults but more of a
            coach or helper. The feedback process should be positive. The rater can avoid potential pitfalls by approaching
            the feedback session with a positive attitude. Second, raters can avoid many other pitfalls by practicing good
            observation skills that:
            11.14.5.2.1. Gather supporting notes over a period of time.
            11.14.5.2.2. Discriminate between relevant and irrelevant information.
            11.14.5.2.3. Focus on specific behaviors and outcomes.
            11.14.5.2.4. Decide what aspects of the job are really measurable and important.
            11.14.5.2.5. Sample selectively when direct observation is infrequent.
            11.14.5.2.6. Communicate regularly with ratees.
11.15. The Feedback Session:
      11.15.1. Open the Feedback Session.
            Creating a relaxed atmosphere is conducive to having an open discussion. It is extremely important to place the
            ratee at ease. Seating arrangements should foster communication (across the corner of a desk or table or a chair-
            facing-chair arrangement works well). During this stage, focus on a neutral topic or event, recap the last
            feedback session, or thank the person for his or her efforts during the observation period. Any opening
            conversation should be brief. Being friendly and sincere is essential.
      11.15.2. Identify the Purpose and Discuss Topics:
            11.15.2.1. The rater must take time to fully explain the purpose of the feedback session. The rater should seek
            input from the individual at this initial stage. The ratee‘s ideas or opinions of what has been done so far and
            what can be done better are important aspects of developing goals and objectives for improvement. The rater
            should focus on the ratee‘s strengths and accomplishments as well as the recommended improvement areas. The
            rater should be specific about the actual behavior that caused the accomplishment or deficiencies and describe
            the effects of this behavior on others.
            11.15.2.2. Raters must give the feedback session their full attention, both mentally and physically. They must be
            sincerely interested in their personnel; otherwise, the Airmen or NCOs will recognize the insincerity and not
            share the personal information needed in order to help. An important aspect of giving an individual full
            attention is listening to what is being communicated—not just the words and symbols used. For example, eye
            contact, posture, head nods, facial expressions, and verbal behavior are important indications of the ratee‘s inner
            emotions and attitudes. At the same time raters are concerned about their own behavior; they must also be
            sensitive to the same cues from the ratees and adjust accordingly.
      11.15.3. Develop and Implement a Course of Action.
            Using one of the feedback approaches, the rater and ratee should develop a plan to achieve success. This plan
            should include objectives and priorities that specify the quantity, quality, timeliness, and manner of actions
            desired. To use the plan to its fullest extent, ensure all key points are written on the PFW and given to the ratee.
            This acts not only as a summary for the ratee but also as a memory jogger of the discussion for later use.
11.16. Tips for Better Feedback:
      11.16.1. Ratees must first accept the rater before they can willingly accept feedback. The successful rater does not rely
      on grade or position. To be successful, raters must develop ratee confidence in their competence, sincerity, and
      fairness before the feedback session.
      11.16.2. Perceptions and opinions should be presented as such and not as facts.
      11.16.3. Feedback should be in terms of specific relevant behavior and not on generalities, the rater‘s attitude, or
      personal feelings toward the individual.
      11.16.4. Feedback should be centered around those areas over which a ratee can exercise some control.
264                                                                                   1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
      11.16.5. When feedback is mainly evaluative versus purely descriptive, it should be in terms of established criteria,
      probable outcomes, and means of improvement. While feedback is intended to disclose expectations, it should be
      based on accepted standards and needs of the Air Force versus personal opinions, likes, dislikes, and biases.
      11.16.6. Feedback is pointless unless a ratee benefits from it. Praise for the sake of praise has no value. Feedback
      should motivate, build self-confidence, or reinforce top performance. Negative feedback that does not aid in improved
      performance or a higher level of performance should not be given.
      11.16.7. Listen carefully. Paraphrase what is heard to check perceptions. Ask questions for clarification.
      11.16.8. Give positive feedback in a manner that communicates acceptance of the ratee as a worthwhile person.
      11.16.9. Feedback should avoid ―loaded‖ terms that produce emotional reactions and heightened defenses.
      11.16.10. Remember that feedback stops when communication stops.
11.17. Close the Feedback Session:
      11.17.1. Summarize.
            Before the session ends, the rater should take a few minutes to review and summarize the key items discussed
            and reinforce the goals for the next observation period. A good method of summarizing the session is to ask the
            ratee for comments to make sure he or she understands the results of the session. Most importantly, end the
            session on a positive, encouraging, and forward-looking note.
      11.17.2. Follow Up and Monitor the Subordinate’s Performance.
            The rater should plan for the next observation period as soon as the session is completed. The existing notes
            help the rater to monitor the individual‘s performance progress and provide a starting point for the next
            feedback session. Again, formal sessions are not the only times to provide feedback—a rater should never wait
            to give feedback. Informal feedback on a regular basis helps keep the ratee on the road to improvement,
            increase motivation, and prevent new problems from developing. The goal of the feedback process is to
            improve individual duty performance. Through the rater‘s efforts, the individual benefits professionally; the
            rater benefits from a more productive worker; and the Air Force benefits from increased mission
            accomplishment.

Section 11D—Enlisted Performance Reports
11.18. When To Submit an Enlisted Performance Report.
      A listing of situations in which EPRs may be required is provided in paragraphs 11.18.1 through 11.18.4. The list is
      not all-inclusive; many exceptions and special rules are involved in EPR submission requirements. If in doubt, refer to
      AFI 36-2406 or contact the MPS for assistance. Raters submit an EPR:
      11.18.1. When the ratee is an A1C or below, has 20 months or more of total active federal military service (TAFMS),
      has not yet had a report, and 120 calendar days of supervision have elapsed. The reason for the report is ―Initial.‖
      11.18.2. When the ratee is a SrA or above, has not had a report for at least a year, and 120 calendar days of supervision
      have elapsed. The reason for the report is ―Annual.‖
      11.18.3. When a member is placed on or removed from the control roster according to AFI 36-2907, Unfavorable
      Information File (UIF) Program, and 60 calendar days of supervision have elapsed. The reason for the report is
      ―Directed by Commander.‖
      11.18.4. To document unsatisfactory or marginal performance, or a significant improvement in duty performance, and
      120 calendar days of supervision have elapsed. The reason for the report is ―Directed by Commander.‖
11.19. When Not To Submit an Enlisted Performance Report.
      Just as there are times when the rater must submit an EPR, there are times when EPRs are not required. A basic listing
      of situations in which EPRs may not be required is included in paragraphs 11.19.1 through 11.19.5. The list is not all-
      inclusive and does not contain all the criteria pertinent to each rule. Refer to AFI 36-2406 for more information. Raters
      do not submit EPRs in the following situations:
      11.19.1. When an A1C or below has less than 20 months of TAFMS.
      11.19.2. When individuals are in prisoner status, on appellate leave, or absent without official leave (AWOL).
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                              265

      11.19.3. If the individual died on active duty. However, if a report was already being processed at the time death
      occurred, it becomes optional.
      11.19.4. When personnel with an approved retirement date meet all the following criteria: (Note: The rater may decide
      to write the report even though the criteria are met.)
            11.19.4.1. The retirement date is within 1 year of the projected annual closeout date of the report and the
            retirement application was approved before the projected annual closeout date.
            11.19.4.2. The enlisted member will not be considered for promotion before the retirement date.
            11.19.4.3. Retirement is not withdrawn. (Note: A report is due if the member‘s retirement is withdrawn.)
      11.19.5. If personnel have an approved separation date, provided the date of separation is within 1 year of the
      projected annual closeout date, and the separation was approved before the projected annual closeout date. (Note: The
      rater may decide to write the report even though the criteria are met.)
11.20. Processing Enlisted Performance Reports:
      11.20.1. The rater receives an EPR notice and any supporting material. The rater reviews the EPR notice and contacts
      the MPS if he or she has questions. The rater may provide one copy of the EPR notice to the ratee for review. If the
      EPR notice indicates that the ratee has a UIF, the rater must review the contents of this file before preparing the EPR.
      11.20.2. The rater and ratee review the information on the EPR notice, such as social security number, name, grade,
      and duty title, and contact the MPS to resolve any errors. In addition to reviewing the EPR notice, the rater must
      review the ratee‘s PIF. The completed EPR is due to the MPS no later than 30 days after closeout.
      11.20.3. The rating chain completes the EPR and forwards it to the MPS.
      11.20.4. After the rating chain completes the EPR, the rater and ratee conduct feedback and finalize the EPR.
      11.20.5. Personnel in the MPS update the EPR rating into the Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) and upload
      the digitally signed form into the Case Management System (CMS). CMS transfers the evaluation to the Air Force
      Personnel Center (AFPC) for inclusion into the ratee‘s Automated Records Management System (ARMS) record.
      Exception: If the EPR contains handwritten signatures, the original is mailed to AFPC for inclusion in ARMS and
      promotion records.
11.21. Who Submits Enlisted Performance Reports.
      The rater (normally the immediate supervisor) prepares the report unless the rater dies, is missing in action, is captured
      or interned, becomes incapacitated, or is relieved of evaluator responsibility during the period of the report. If any of
      these conditions exist, the rater‘s rater assumes the rating duties. The ―new‖ rater must have sufficient knowledge of
      the ratee‘s duty performance and the required number of days of supervision. (For additional information, see AFI 36-
      2406.) If the rater‘s rater has insufficient knowledge to prepare the report for the required period of supervision, he or
      she must gather knowledge of the ratee‘s duty performance from all available sources (first sergeant, former
      supervisors, etc.). If unusual circumstances dictate sufficient knowledge cannot be obtained, AFPC authorizes filing an
      AF Form 77, Letter of Evaluation, in the ratee‘s record stating why a report could not be prepared for the period.
11.22. AF Form 910, Enlisted Performance Report (AB thru TSgt), and AF Form 911, Senior Enlisted Performance
Report (MSgt thru CMSgt).
      Paragraph 11.22.1 through paragraph 11.22.14 and Figures 11.3 and 11.4 provide noninclusive guidance for
      completing AF Forms 910 and 911. This guidance is not meant to provide detailed information on completing the
      forms, but rather to provide relevant information in certain areas of particular interest.
      11.22.1. Section I, Ratee Identification Data.
            See the EPR notice for this data. If any data is incorrect, notify the MPS for correction. Note: Abbreviations in
            block 5 may be expanded for clarity.
            11.22.1.1. Name. Enter last name, first name, middle initial, and Jr., Sr., etc. If there is no middle initial, the use
            of ―NMI‖ is optional.
            11.22.1.2. Social Security Number (SSN). Enter the SSN.
            11.22.1.3. Grade. Enter the appropriate grade held on the closeout date of the EPR.
266                                                                                   1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
            11.22.1.4. Duty Air Force Specialty Code (DAFSC). Enter the DAFSC held as of the closeout date of the
            EPR, to include prefix and suffix (if applicable).
            11.22.1.5. Organization, Command, Location, and Component. Enter information as of the closeout date of
            the EPR. Nomenclature does not necessarily duplicate what is on the EPR notice. The goal is to provide an
            accurate description of where and to whom a member belongs on the EPR closeout date.
            11.22.1.6. Personnel Accounting Symbol (PAS) Code and Senior Rater Identification (SRID). Enter the
            PAS code and SRID for the ratee‘s unit of assignment as of the closeout date.
            11.22.1.7. Period of Report. Enter the day following the ratee‘s last EPR closeout date for the ―From‖ date. For
            the ―Thru‖ date, enter the date on the EPR notice or see AFI 36-2406 to determine this date.
            11.22.1.8. Number of Days Supervision. Enter the number of days the rater supervised the ratee for the
            reporting period.
            11.22.1.9. Reason for Report. Enter the reason for the report from the EPR notice (for example, annual, CRO,
            etc.).
      11.22.2. Section II, Job Description.
            Section II provides information regarding the position the ratee holds in the unit and the nature or level of job
            responsibilities. The rater prepares the information for this section.
            11.22.2.1. Duty Title. Enter the approved duty title as of the closeout date. If the duty title on the EPR notice is
            abbreviated and entries are not clear, spell it out. If wrong, enter the correct duty title and take appropriate
            action to change MilPDS. (Note: This action is initiated upon receipt of the EPR notice as stated in paragraph
            11.20.1.) Ensure the duty title is commensurate with the ratee‘s grade, Air Force specialty code (AFSC), and
            level of responsibility.
            11.22.2.2. Significant Additional Duty(s). Enter any significant additional duties the ratee holds.
            11.22.2.3. Key Duties, Tasks, and Responsibilities. Enter a clear description of the ratee‘s duties. Avoid
            jargon and acronyms. Describe tasks performed, how selective the ratee‘s assignment is, and the scope or level
            of responsibility. Include the dollar value of projects managed and the number of people supervised. Earlier
            duties or additional duties held during the reporting period may be included if they influence ratings and
            comments.
      11.22.3. Section III, Performance Assessment.
            For each item in Section III, the rater places an ―X‖ in the block that accurately describes the ratee‘s
            performance. Additional evaluators review reports to ensure the ratings accurately describe the ratee‘s
            performance and comments are compatible with or support the ratings. Evaluators must return reports with
            unsupported statements for additional information or reconsideration of ratings. Additional evaluators can
            disagree with the rating by marking ―non-concur‖ and making specific comments regarding the exact standard
            and or comment with which he or she disagrees in Section VI of the form.
      11.22.4. Section IV, Rater Information.
            Enter rater identification as of the closeout date. The forms have digital signature and auto date capability. If
            digital signatures cannot be used, sign in reproducible black or blue ink. Do not sign before the closeout date
            (only on or after). Rater assessment and feedback block will be locked and additional rater signature capability
            will be unlocked with rater‘s digital signature.
      11.22.5. Section V, Overall Performance Assessment.
            Consider the ratee‘s readiness for increased rank and responsibility and how he or she compares to others in the
            same grade and AFSC. The rater places an ―X‖ in the block that best describes the ratee‘s promotion potential.
            Note: Raters must not rate people with strong performance records and potential the same as average or weak
            performers.
      11.22.6. Feedback Certification.
            Raters certify performance feedback in this area by entering the date when the last feedback was performed.
            Enter date as DD MMM YYYY. If feedback was not accomplished, state the reason why. If feedback was not
            required, enter ―N/A.‖ Complete this portion of the form before digitally signing the form. Do not use the date
            feedback was provided in conjunction with completion of the evaluation.
AFPAM36-2241     1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                          267

    11.22.7. Section VI, Additional Rater’s Comments.
          This section is used to support the rating decision and to allow evaluators to comment on the ratee‘s overall
          performance and performance-based potential as compared to others in the same grade known by the evaluators.
          When agreeing with the report, mark the ―concur‖ block. Use bullet format to provide comments that add
          meaning and are compatible with the rating in Section VI. Do not repeat comments provided in the previous
          section. The additional rater must be the rater‘s rater unless the additional rater does not meet grade
          requirements. The rater and additional rater should discuss disagreements, if any, when preparing reports. Prior
          evaluators are first given an opportunity to change the evaluation; however, they will not change their
          evaluation just to satisfy the evaluator who disagrees. If, after discussion, the disagreement remains, the
          disagreeing evaluator marks the ―non-concur‖ block and comments on each item in disagreement.
    11.22.8. Additional Rater Identification.
          Additional raters may be assigned after the closeout date. For evaluators assigned on or before the closeout date,
          enter identification data as of the closeout; for evaluators subsequently assigned, enter identification data as of
          the signature date. The forms have digital signature and auto date capability. If digital signatures cannot be
          used, sign in reproducible black or blue ink. Do not sign before the closeout date (only on or after). Once
          digitally signed, the block cannot be altered. On the AF Form 911, once the additional rater signs, the
          reviewer‘s signature block will be enabled for digital signature.
    11.22.9. AF Form 910, Section VII, and AF Form 911, Section X, Functional Examiner/Air Force Advisor.
          When the final evaluator on an EPR is not an Air Force officer or Department of the Air Force official, an Air
          Force advisor is designated to advise raters on matters pertaining to Air Force performance reports. For EPRs
          on TSgt and below, the Air Force advisor serves in the grade of MSgt or above. For EPRs on MSgt thru CMSgt,
          the Air Force advisor serves in the grade of Major or above. The Air Force advisor does not change any
          statement or rating on the performance report. The advisor may provide clarification regarding the ratee‘s duty
          performance on AF Form 77 according to AFI 36-2406 and attach it to the EPR. An Air Force advisor will
          have, or be able to obtain, knowledge of the ratee, and when feasible, be equal to or higher in grade than the
          final evaluator.
    11.22.10. AF Form 911, Section VII, Reviewer’s Comments.
          Do not use Section VII if Section VI is not completed. If the additional rater is the final evaluator, enter ―This
          section not used.‖ If used, this section must contain comments in bullet format. The reviewer will mark the
          ―concur‖ or ―non-concur‖ block, and make appropriate comments (if applicable). Reviewers (senior raters) may
          endorse EPRs:
          11.22.10.1. To differentiate between individuals with similar performance records as both ratings and
          endorsement levels influence those using the AF Form 911 to make personnel decisions.
          11.22.10.2. To meet the minimum grade requirement to close out the report.
          11.22.10.3. When the ratee meets the TIG requirements for promotion.
          11.22.10.4. When the ratee is a CMSgt or a CMSgt-selectee.

            In this section (Section VIII, AF Form 910, and Section XI, AF Form 911), the unit or squadron section
            commander influences report quality, removes exaggerations, identifies inflated ratings, and provides
            information to evaluators for finalizing reports. If the commander agrees with the report, he or she marks the
            ―concur‖ block and digitally signs in the space provided. If the commander disagrees with the report, he or she
            provides reasons for disagreement on AF Form 77. Commanders who are part of the rating chain will complete
            and sign both this section and the appropriate evaluator‘s section. In this instance, the commander will sign the
            report twice. The two signatures serve separate purposes, one as an evaluator regarding duty performance, and
            one as a commander regarding quality review. Enlisted personnel authorized to perform the commander‘s
            review must include the words ―Commander,‖ ―Commandant,‖ or ―Detachment/Flight Chief‖ in the signature
            block.
      11.22.12. AF Form 911, Section VIII, Final Evaluators Position.
            The final evaluator completes Section VIII by placing an ―X‖ in the appropriate block for the level of
            endorsement.
      11.22.13. AF Form 911, Section IX, Time-in-Grade (TIG) Eligible.
            Section IX pertains to TIG eligibility for senior rater endorsement—not the ratee‘s actual promotion eligibility
            as of the closeout date. Using information extracted from the EPR notice, the rater completes Section IX before
            forwarding the EPR for additional endorsement. TIG does not apply to CMSgts, CMSgt-selectees, or reservists.
            SMSgt-selectees are not eligible for senior rater endorsement because they are not TIG eligible for the next
            promotion cycle. See AFI 36-2406 for additional information on TIG eligibility.
      11.22.14. AF Form 910, Section IX, and AF Form 911, Section XII, Ratee’s Acknowledgement.
            The rater conducts face-to-face feedback in conjunction with issuing the evaluation and obtains the ratee‘s
            signature in this section. The EPR serves as the feedback form. Do not use a PFW.
11.23. Prohibited Evaluator Considerations and Comments.
      Certain items are prohibited for consideration in the performance evaluation process and may not be commented upon
      on any EES document. These include:
      11.23.1. Duty history or performance outside the current reporting period.
      11.23.2. Previous reports or ratings, except in conjunction with performance feedback sessions.
      11.23.3. Performance feedback. Evaluators do not refer to performance feedback sessions in any area of the EPR
      except in the performance feedback certification block (Section V).
      11.23.4. Events that occur after the closeout date. If an incident or event occurs between the time an annual report
      closes and the time it becomes a matter of record that is of such serious significance that inclusion in this report is
      warranted, the rater must request an extension of the closeout date. This includes completion of an investigation that
      began before the closeout date or confirmation of behavior that was only alleged as of the closeout date. The authority
      to extend a closeout date is retained by AFPC. AFPC grants extensions to cover only the time necessary to complete
      actions, not to exceed 59 days; a commander-directed report may be prepared with 60 days of supervision. Requests
      for extension are sent through the servicing MPS to AFPC for approval. Include the member‘s information, reason for
      the report, original closeout date, requested closeout date, specific justification for the request, and all pertinent
      information such as dates of investigations, etc.
      11.23.5. Prior events. Do not include comments regarding events that occurred in a previous reporting period unless
      the events add significantly to the performance report, were not known to other evaluators, and (or) were not
      previously included in a performance report. For example, an event, positive or negative, that came to light after a
      report became a matter of record but occurred during the period of that report could be mentioned in the ratee‘s next
      report because the incident was not previously reported. In rare cases, serious offenses such as those punishable by
      court-martial, may not come to light or be substantiated for several years. In these cases, including this information
      may be appropriate even though the incident or behavior occurred before the last reporting period. Additionally,
      negative incidents from previous reporting periods involving the character, conduct, or integrity of the ratee that
      continue to influence the performance or utilization of the ratee may be commented upon in this context only.
      Commanders and senior raters make the determination of what constitutes a significant addition.
AFPAM36-2241      1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                           273

    11.23.6. Conduct based on unreliable information. Raters must ensure information relied upon to document
    performance, especially derogatory information relating to unsatisfactory behavior or misconduct, is reliable and
    supported by substantial evidence. The rater should consult with the servicing staff judge advocate (SJA) if there is a
    question of whether the standard has been met. Be particularly cautious about referring to charges preferred;
    investigations; boards of inquiry, such as accident investigation boards; using information obtained from these
    sources; or any similar actions related to a member that are not complete as of the closeout date of the report. When it
    is determined that such conduct is appropriate for comment, make reference to the underlying performance, behavior,
    or misconduct itself—not merely to the fact that the conduct may have resulted in a punitive or administrative action
    taken against the member, such as a letter of reprimand, Article 15, court-martial conviction, etc. Refer to AFI 36-
    2406 if an extension of the closeout date is warranted to determine if reliable information of unsatisfactory
    performance or misconduct has been established.
    11.23.7. Any action against an individual that resulted in acquittal or failure to successfully implement an intended
    personnel action. For example, do not say SSgt Johnson was acquitted of assault charges or that involuntary separation
    action was unsuccessful. This does not mean, however, that the underlying conduct that formed the basis for the action
    cannot be mentioned. A determination as to the appropriateness of doing so should be made only after consulting with
    the servicing SJA. The decision to include such information should be made only when evaluators can establish that
    the information is reliable and supported by substantial evidence.
    11.23.8. Confidential statements, testimony, or data obtained by or presented to boards under AFI 91-204, Safety
    Investigations and Reports.
    11.23.9. Actions taken by an individual outside the normal chain of command that represent guaranteed rights of
    appeal; for example, Inspector General, Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records, equal opportunity and
    treatment complaints, and congressional inquiry.
    11.23.10. A recommendation for decoration. The rater may only include those decorations actually approved or
    presented during the reporting period. The term ―decorations,‖ as used here, applies to those for which a medal is
    awarded and worn on the Air Force uniform, such as an Air Force achievement medal. The rater may mention other
    awards or nominations for honors and awards, such as ―outstanding maintainer‖ or ―12 Outstanding Airmen of the
    Year.‖
    11.23.11. Race, ethnic origin, gender, age, or religion of the ratee. Do not refer to these items in such a way that others
    could interpret the comments as reflecting favorably or unfavorably on the person. This is not meant to prohibit
    evaluators from commenting on involvement in cultural or church activities but to caution against the use of specific
    religious denominations, etc. For example, ―TSgt Jones is the first female ever selected for training....‖ is an
    inappropriate reference to gender. The rater may, however, use pronouns to reflect gender (such as he, she, him, her).
    11.23.12. Disqualification under DoD 5210.42-R/AFMAN 10-3902, Nuclear Weapons Personnel Reliability Program
    (PRP). However, the behavior of the ratee that resulted in the action may be referenced.
    11.23.13. Drug or alcohol abuse rehabilitation programs. Focus on the behavior, conduct, or performance resulting
    from alcohol or drug use versus the actual consumption of alcohol or drugs or participation in a rehabilitation program.
    Only competent medical authorities may diagnose alcoholism or drug addiction.
    11.23.14. Score data on the WAPS score notice or SNCO promotion score notice, board scores, test scores, etc.
    11.23.15. Family activities or marital status. Do not consider or include information (either positive or negative)
    regarding the member‘s marital status or the employment, education, or volunteer service activities (on or off the
    military installation) of the member‘s family.
    11.23.16. Broad statements outside the scope of the evaluator‘s responsibility or knowledge. A broad statement is one
    that implies knowledge of Air Force members not assigned within the evaluator‘s realm of knowledge. For example, a
    group commander may not state the ratee is ―the best civil engineer in the business‖ because he or she does not have
    knowledge of all civil engineers. Similarly, phrases such as ―top 5 percent Airman‖ or ―clearly a top 1 percent SNCO‖
    are inappropriate because the evaluator does not have firsthand knowledge of all Air Force Airmen or SNCOs. Broad
    statements such as these lack credibility.
    11.23.17. Physical fitness and (or) body composition scores. If the ratee does not meet Air Force fitness standards,
    then the wording should not focus on the overall numerical fitness scores but rather the reasons and (or) behavior that
    resulted in the poor physical assessment.
274                                                                                   1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
11.24. Referral Reports:
      11.24.1. A referral report is an EPR that contains a ―Does Not Meet Standards‖ in any block in Section III or if the
      ratee receives a ―Poor‖ (overall rating ―1‖) or ―Needs Improvement‖ (overall rating ―2‖) in Section V, the report is a
      referral EPR and must be referred. Also, an EPR that contains derogatory comments or imply or refer to behavior not
      meeting minimum acceptable standards of personal conduct, character, or integrity must be referred. The rater should
      ensure consistency among performance factors, ratings, and comments. Note: A referral EPR may not have an overall
      assessment of ―5‖.
      11.24.2. An evaluator whose ratings or comments cause a report to become a referral report must give the ratee a
      chance to comment on the report. Although a report may be referred several times during processing; normally, an
      evaluator will not refer the report more than once. This, however, does not include reports referred again to allow the
      ratee the opportunity to rebut a report that, after initial referral, was corrected or changed before becoming a matter of
      record. Additionally, a report will be referred more than once when a subsequent evaluator gives additional referral
      ratings or comments. Referral procedures are established to allow the ratee to respond to items that make a report
      referral before it becomes a matter of record.
      11.24.3. The ratee has 3 duty days to submit comments and the rebuttal.
11.25. Letter of Evaluation (LOE).
      LOEs cover periods of ratee performance too short to require a performance report, or periods of time when the ratee
      is under someone other than the designated rater. The evaluator uses LOEs to prepare the ratee‘s next performance
      report but does not attach the LOEs to the report. Evaluators may paraphrase or quote information provided in LOEs
      (except for stratifications). Additionally, LOEs are optional, except for active duty A1Cs and below (with less than 20
      months of TAFMS) when the reporting official changes due to the permanent change of station or permanent change
      of assignment of the ratee or rater. In this case, the rater must have at least 60 days of supervision.
11.26. Conclusion.
      This chapter covers the EES, identifies responsibilities, and discusses the performance feedback process and EPRs.
      Anytime questions arise on the process of the EES, members should refer to AFI 36-2406 or contact the MPS for
      specific guidance on Air Force procedures and local requirements. The EES deals directly with the Air Force‘s most
      precious resource—people. Only by working with and assisting subordinates can supervisors understand their
      strengths, weaknesses, and contributions and accomplish the mission.

                                              TRAINING AND EDUCATION
Section 12A—Overview
12.1. Introduction.
      On-the-job training (OJT) has been around since the beginning of history and has been used in the United States by
      both public and private industries for many years. Today, most successful companies have effective OJT programs
      because OJT works. Well-trained workers mean higher production, positive morale, greater profits, and higher wages.
      Air Force training costs millions of dollars annually, and for good reason. To accomplish the mission, whether that
      means satellites into orbit, planes in the air, reports to higher headquarters, or vehicles on the road, training is a must.
      In addition to OJT, training management covers upgrade training, skill levels, retraining, and training responsibilities,
      forms, and documentation. Finally, each base education office provides Service members with educational
      opportunities in which they may voluntarily participate during off-duty time or other times, as authorized by military
      policies. The base education office also provides information on financial assistance and commissioning programs.
Section 12B—Training Management
12.2. Education and Training (E&T) Purpose.
      Skilled and trained personnel are critical to the Air Force in providing a strong national defense capability. The Air
      Force OJT program provides training for personnel to attain knowledge and skill qualifications required to perform
      duties in their specialty.
12.3. Strategy.
      Develop, manage, and execute realistic and flexible training programs to produce a highly skilled, motivated force
      capable of carrying out all tasks and functions in support of the Air Force mission. These programs should provide the
      foundation for Air Force readiness.
12.4. Training and Mission Accomplishment.
      Training is an integral part of the unit‘s mission. An effective training program requires commander and supervisory
      involvement at all levels.
12.5. Training and Airman Career Program.
      Supervisors must take an active role in the trainee‘s career progression and explain the relationship between training
      and career progression. While the supervisor‘s primary responsibility is to plan a program that outlines specific short-
      term, mission-related goals for the trainee, overall success depends on the supervisor‘s ability to advise and assist
      Airmen in reaching their long-range career objectives.
12.6. Training Components.
      The Air Force OJT program consists of three components:
      12.6.1. Job Knowledge—satisfied through career development courses (CDC) designed to provide career knowledge,
      general task, and deployment/unit type code (UTC) task knowledge applicable to the Air Force specialty code (AFSC)
      that is gained through a planned program of study involving CDCs or technical references listed in the applicable
      career field education and training plan (CFETP) across a wide spectrum of subjects pertaining to a career field. When
      CDCs are not available, trainees study the applicable technical references identified by the supervisor and/or CFETP.
      12.6.2. Job Proficiency—hands-on training provided on the job, allowing the trainee to gain proficiency in tasks
      performed in the work center.
      12.6.3. Job Experience—gained during and after upgrade training to build confidence and competence.
12.7. Upgrade Training (UGT).
      UGT is the key to the total training program. It leads to award of the higher skill level and is designed to increase skills
      and abilities. Air Force specialty code UGT requirements for award of 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9-skill levels are outlined in
      Chapter 4 of AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and
      Enlisted), and the applicable CFETP.
276                                                                                 1 OCTOBER 2013        AFPAM36-2241
      12.7.1. Apprentice.
             Airmen must complete an initial skills course for award of the 3-skill level. Retraining into an AFSC may be
             accomplished via OJT alone only when specified in the retraining instructions and as approved by the Air Force
             Career Field Manager (AFCFM) or the Air Reserve Component (ARC) career field functional manager.
             Personnel retraining via OJT may be awarded a 3-skill level when they complete knowledge training on all
             tasks taught in the initial skills course and other tasks and mandatory requirements identified by the AFCFM.
      12.7.2. Journeyman.
             Airmen must complete mandatory CDCs if available and applicable mandatory core tasks identified in the
             CFETP. Award of the 5-skill level also requires completion of a minimum of 12 months in UGT and mandatory
             requirements listed in the Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD). Additionally, the member must
             be recommended by the supervisor and approved by the commander. Individuals in retraining status, training
             status code (TSC) F, are subject to the same training requirements. Exception: The member must complete a
             minimum of 9 months in UGT.
      12.7.3. Craftsman.
             To be a craftsman, the member must be at least a staff sergeant; complete mandatory CDCs, if available; and
             complete applicable mandatory core tasks identified in the CFETP. Award of the 7-skill level also requires
             completion of: a 7-skill level craftsman course (if AFSC requires it); mandatory requirements listed in the
             AFECD; and a minimum of 12 months in training. Additionally, the member must be recommended by the
             supervisor and approved by the commander. Individuals in retraining status (TSC G) are subject to the same
             training requirements. Exception: The member must complete a minimum of 6 months in UGT.
      12.7.4. Superintendent.
             For award of the 9-skill level, the member must be at least a senior master sergeant and meet mandatory
             requirements listed in the AFECD, be recommended by the supervisor, and be approved by the commander.
12.8. Retraining Program.
      The retraining program is designed to balance the number of personnel in specific grades and year groups of the Air
      Force specialty (AFS). Once retraining is approved and the Airman has been assigned duty in the new specialty, UGT
      begins. With minor exceptions, training requirements are identical for retrainees and standard upgrade trainees.
12.9. Training Responsibilities:
      12.9.1. Unit Training Manager (UTM).
             The UTM is the commander‘s key staff member responsible for overall management of the training program.
             UTMs serve as training consultants to all unit members and determine if quality training programs are in effect
             within all sections. UTMs:
             12.9.1.1. Develop, manage, and conduct training in support of in-garrison and expeditionary mission
             requirements; advise and assist commanders and unit personnel in executing their training responsibilities; and
             conduct a staff assistance visit (SAV) of the unit‘s training program every 24 months.
             12.9.1.2. Interview newly assigned personnel within 30 days (60 days for ARC) to determine training status and
             CDC enrollment/progression requirements. Initiate AF Form 623, Individual Training Record, six-part folders
             (when required by the AFCFM), or approved electronic equivalent, for all trainees entering UGT for the first
             time and provide to the supervisor. Conduct a comprehensive trainee orientation according to AFI 36-2201 for
             trainees initially entering UGT within 60 days of assignment (90 days for ARC). UTMs must also manage the
             unit CDC program and conduct a training progress review with the supervisor and trainee at the 24th month of
             UGT to evaluate status.
             12.9.1.3. Ensure all work centers have a master training plan (MTP). Assist work centers in developing a MTP
             to plan, manage, and execute training activities.
      12.9.2. Supervisor.
             Supervisors have the single greatest impact on mission accomplishment. They must share their experiences and
             expertise to meet mission requirements and provide a quality training program to the trainee. Supervisors must
             plan, conduct, and evaluate training. Supervisors will:
             12.9.2.1. Use CFETPs (or approved electronic equivalent) to manage work center and individual training and
             develop MTPs to ensure completion of all work center duty position requirements (for example, 100 percent
AFPAM36-2241      1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                           277

           task coverage). The supervisor must also integrate training with day-to-day work center operations and consider
           trainer and equipment availability, training opportunities, and schedules.
           12.9.2.2. Conduct and document work center training orientation within 60 days of new assignment (120 days
           for ARC). Also, conduct and document an initial evaluation of newly assigned personnel‘s trainee qualifications
           within 60 days of initial permanent change of station (PCS) or permanent change of assignment (PCA) (120
           days for ARC).
           12.9.2.3. Select trainers (and certifiers as required by the AFCFM) based on skill qualifications with the
           assistance of the UTM.
           12.9.2.4. Administer the CDC program for assigned trainees.
           12.9.2.5. Maintain AF Form 623, six-part folder, or other approved training record for Airmen in the grades of
           airman basic through technical sergeant (or personnel in combat ready duty positions, if required by the
           AFCFM) and senior noncommissioned officers in retraining status, or as directed by the AFCFM. Before
           submitting members for upgrade, ensure the trainee, as a minimum, meets all mandatory requirements as
           defined in the AFECD, CFETP, and the Air Force job qualification standard (AFJQS).
     12.9.3. Trainer.
           The trainer and supervisor may be the same individual. If necessary, the supervisor may assign someone else to
           provide the training. Trainers are selected based on their experience and ability to provide instruction to the
           trainees. Additionally, they must maintain task qualification and complete the Air Force Training Course.
           Trainer responsibilities include planning, conducting, and documenting training; preparing and using teaching
           outlines or task breakdowns, as necessary; developing evaluation tools; and briefing the trainee and supervisor
           on the training evaluation results.
     12.9.4. Task Certifier.
           Task certifiers provide third-party certification and evaluation on tasks identified by the AFCFM, if applicable.
           The certifier must conduct additional evaluations and certify qualification on those designated tasks. Certifiers
           must be at least a staff sergeant with a 5-skill level or civilian equivalent, attend the Air Force Training Course,
           and be capable of evaluating the task being certified. Certifiers will develop evaluation tools or use established
           training evaluation tools and methods to determine the trainee‘s ability and training program effectiveness and
           will brief the trainee, supervisor, and trainer on the training evaluation results.
     12.9.5. Trainee.
           The trainee is the focal point of the Air Force training program. Trainees must make every effort to become
           qualified to perform in their AFS. The success and quality of trainee training greatly depends on the relationship
           between the supervisor, trainer, and trainee. Trainees must:
           12.9.5.1. Actively participate in all opportunities for upgrade and qualification training.
           12.9.5.2. Comprehend the applicable CFETP requirements and career path.
           12.9.5.3. Obtain and maintain knowledge, qualifications, and appropriate skill level within the assigned
           specialty.
           12.9.5.4. Budget on- and off-duty time to complete assigned training tasks, particularly CDC and self-study
           training requirements, within established time limits.
           12.9.5.5. Request assistance from the supervisor, trainer, and UTM when having difficulty with any part of
           training.
           12.9.5.6. Acknowledge and document task qualification upon completion of training.
12.10. Training Forms and Documents.
     Training documentation is important to personnel at all levels because it validates the status of training and task
     qualification. Documentation also helps management assess mission capability and readiness, and it defines
     requirements for individual career progression.

      12.10.1. AF Form 623.
            The AF Form 623 (or electronic equivalent) is the standard folder used as a training record. The form reflects
            past and current qualifications and is used to determine training requirements. Supervisors maintain the AF
            Form 623 for all assigned personnel according to AFI 36-2201. The form is available to all personnel in the
            chain of command, including the UTM, upon request. Return the form to the member upon separation,
            retirement, commissioning, or promotion to master sergeant, unless otherwise directed by the AFCFM.
            Exception: Do not give AF Forms 623 containing classified information to the individual.
      12.10.2. Career Field Education and Training Program (CFETP).
            The CFETP is a comprehensive core document identifying life-cycle education and training (E&T)
            requirements, training support resources, core and home station training (HST), and deployment/UTC task
            requirements for a specialty. Supervisors use the CFETP to plan, prioritize, manage, and execute training within
            the career field. CFETPs are used to identify and certify all past and current qualifications. Keep at least one
            copy of the entire CFETP (Part I and II), in the work center for general access and MTP development. Unless
            otherwise directed by the AFCFM, work center supervisors may file only Part II of the CFETP, with cover page
            and identification (ID) page, in the AF Form 623, or equivalent form. If the CFETP is divided into distinct
            sections (by aircraft, duty position, or mission, etc.) then file only the sections applicable to the individual, such
            as current/past qualifications, and current upgrade/duty position training requirements.
            12.10.2.1. Part I. Provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty and is maintained as
            part of the work center MTP.
            12.10.2.2. Part II. Contains the specialty training standard identifying the duties, tasks, and technical references
            to support training, AETC-conducted training, core and HST tasks, deployment/UTC tasks, and correspondence
            course requirements.
      12.10.3. Air Force Job Qualification Standard (AFJQS).
            The AFJQS is a training document approved by the AFCFM for a particular job type or duty position within an
            Air Force specialty.
      12.10.4. AF IMT 623A, On-the-Job Training Record Continuation Sheet.
            Use AF IMT 623A, or automated version, to document an individual‘s training progress. The form reflects
            status, counseling, and breaks in training. The supervisor and/or trainer and the trainee must sign and date all
            entries.
      12.10.5. AF IMT 797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation/Command JQS.
            AF IMT 797 is a continuation of the CFETP, Part II, or AFJQS. This form defines locally assigned duty
            position, home station training, and deployment/UTC requirements not included in the CFETP, Part II.
      12.10.6. AF IMT 803, Report of Task Evaluations.
            Evaluators use AF IMT 803 to conduct and document completion of task evaluations during training SAVs,
            when directed by the commander, or when task certification requires validation. File completed evaluations
            conducted on a single trainee by the supervisor/trainer or task certifier in AF Form 623 until upgraded or no
            longer applicable to the current duty position.
      12.10.7. AF IMT 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training.
            Supervisors use AF IMT 1098 to document selected tasks requiring recurring training or evaluation. Air Force
            and major command directives may identify tasks contained in the CFETP that require special certification,
            recurring training, or evaluation.
      12.10.8. Master Training Plan (MTP).
            The MTP employs a strategy for ensuring all work center job requirements are completed by using a master task
            listing. It provides milestones for tasks and CDC completion, and prioritizes deployment/UTC, home station
            training, upgrade, and qualification tasks.
AFPAM36-2241      1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                        279

12.11. Career Development Course Program Management:
     12.11.1. Purpose and Scope:
           12.11.1.1. CDCs are published to provide the information necessary to satisfy the career knowledge component
           of OJT. These courses are developed from references identified in the CFETP that correlate with mandatory
           knowledge items listed in the Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory. CDCs must contain information on
           basic principles, techniques, and procedures common to an AFSC. They do not contain information on specific
           equipment or tasks unless the specific equipment or task best illustrates a procedure or technique having utility
           to the entire AFSC.
           12.11.1.2. HQ AU/A4L electronically publishes an ―AFSC listing of CDC requirements, identifying all
           mandatory CDCs for skill-level upgrade.‖ The list is available on the HQ AU/A4L website at
           http://www.au.af.mil/au/afiadl/ under the Course and Admin Information tab.
     12.11.2. CDC Administration:
           12.11.2.1. If available, supervisors will use CDCs to satisfy career knowledge requirements for upgrade
           training.
           12.11.2.2. If a CDC becomes available after entering upgrade training, the individual does not have to take the
           CDC, unless specified by the AFCFM.
           12.11.2.3. The UTM will ensure trainees are enrolled in required CDC material within 45 days of inprocessing
           (within 60 days for overseas units).
           12.11.2.4. Within 10 duty days of receipt, the UTM issues CDC material to the supervisor and trainee and briefs
           them on proper use of the CDC and documents the trainee‘s AF IMT 623A or equivalent automated training
           record.
           12.11.2.5. The supervisor determines volume sequence of study, sets the overall course completion schedule,
           and develops a tracking system to monitor progress. Each volume must be completed within 30 days.
           (Exception: The UTM may grant an extension due to mission requirements. ARC and individual mobilization
           augmentees (IMA) have 60 days.) If necessary, the supervisor determines the reason for slow progress, counsels
           the trainee, documents the counseling on AF IMT 623A or automated version, and places the trainee in
           supervised study.
           12.11.2.6. The trainee answers the unit review exercise (URE) questions. The URE is an ―open book‖ teaching
           device. The trainee transfers answers to the field scoring sheet. The supervisor scores the URE, conducts review
           training on the areas missed, fills in the bottom of the scoring sheet, places the field scoring sheet in the AF
           Form 623 or automated training records, counsels the trainee, and documents AF IMT 623A or automated
           version. The supervisor will conduct a comprehensive review of the entire CDC with the trainee in preparation
           for the course examination and documents the review on the AF IMT 623A or automated version.
           12.11.2.7. The supervisor will notify the UTM to schedule and order the course examination.
           12.11.2.8. If the trainee receives a satisfactory result, the supervisor conducts and documents review training,
           then signs and places the course examination scorecard in the AF Form 623 or automated training records until
           the trainee completes UGT or qualification training.
           12.11.2.9. If the trainee receives an unsatisfactory result, the unit commander, with help from the UTM or base
           training manager, interviews the supervisor and trainee to determine reason for failure and corrective action
           required within 30 days from initial notification (90 days for ARC and IMAs). The supervisor documents the
           counseling on AF IMT 623A or automated version, places the trainee in supervised review training, and
           forwards a copy of the evaluation to the base training office.
           12.11.2.10. If the trainee receives a second unsatisfactory course examination result, the unit commander, with
           assistance from the UTM or base training manager, interviews the supervisor and trainee to determine reason
           for failure within 30 days from initial notification (90 days for ARC and IMAs). After reviewing the facts, the
           unit commander decides on one of the following options: (1) Evaluate for possible CDC waiver (do not place
           trainee into TSC T); (2) Withdraw the Airman for failing to progress, place into TSC T, and pursue separation;
           (3) Withdraw the Airman for failing to progress, place into TSC T, request AFSC withdrawal, and recommend
           retraining or return to a previously awarded AFSC; or (4) Withdraw Airman for failing to progress, place into
           TSC T, reevaluate at 90 days, and pursue either option 1, 2, or 3 as appropriate.
280                                                                               1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
Section 12C—Community College of the Air Force (CCAF)
12.12. Community College of the Air Force:
      12.12.1. The CCAF was activated in 1972 to gain academic recognition for technical training conducted by Air Force
      schools. CCAF awards the associate in applied science (AAS) degree to enlisted members of the active duty Air Force,
      Air National Guard, and Air Force Reserve Command. Degree programs are designed to help students meet future
      technological and leadership challenges of the Air Force by combining Air Force technical training with general
      education course work from accredited civilian schools. Since military personnel are constantly relocating in
      performance of their duties, CCAF provides a means for them to complete degree requirements regardless of where
      they are assigned.
      12.12.2. CCAF is the largest community college in the world and is the only community college in the DoD
      exclusively for enlisted personnel. The administrative center is located at Maxwell-Gunter AFB AL. More than 5,700
      instructors in more than 100 affiliated schools teach degree-applicable courses. Each year more than 1.6 million
      semester hours are earned in CCAF classrooms. To date, the college has awarded more than 392,000 AAS degrees .
      12.12.3. CCAF offers 68 degree programs in five general areas: (1) logistics and resources, (2) public and support
      services, (3) allied health, (4) electronics and telecommunications, and (5) aircraft and missile maintenance.
      Individuals may only participate in degree programs designed for their Air Force occupation. CCAF also develops
      programs and other academic credentials that offer professional certification and recognition opportunities.
      12.12.4. Enlisted personnel are automatically registered in a degree program designed for their AFSC during basic
      military training. Each degree program consists of 64 semester hours and combines Air Force E&T with a core of
      general education requirements obtained from civilian colleges and universities or through nationally recognized
      examination programs. Along with the 64 semester hours, students must hold a journeyman (5-skill) level at the time
      of program completion and have a minimum of 16 semester hours of CCAF residency applied to their degree program.
      Residency is defined as credit earned in a CCAF-affiliated school. Table 12.1 identifies the requirements for the
      typical CCAF degree, the number of semester hours required in each area, and general information on the courses that
      fulfill those requirements.

12.13. Professional Credentials and Credentialing Programs:
      12.13.1. Professional Development.
            Credentialing is a critical element of enlisted professional development. During the certification process,
            enlisted personnel gain advanced levels of knowledge and skills beyond their job qualification training.
            Blending Air Force technical training and education with industry-based skill sets and professional certification
            processes benefits the Air Force by molding a more diverse and qualified workforce to maintain critical and
            valuable national defense assets. The individual benefits by being provided the education and credential needed
            by highly technical Air Force career fields. The individual will also possess highly valued skills needed by
            industry when he or she transitions out of the Air Force. End result: industry benefits immensely by receiving a
            highly trained, qualified, experienced, and disciplined employee, a valuable payback of investments. To support
            documentary evidence of training, skills, and practical experience, Airmen are highly encouraged to maintain
            records of all previous and current education, training, and qualifications.
      12.13.2. Collegiate Credit.
            CCAF researches and awards technical credit for degree-relevant governmental and (or) professional
            certifications, licensures, and registries. Students may earn CCAF collegiate credit for certain national
            professional credentials that are approved by CCAF to satisfy applicable technical education and program
            elective requirements. To determine the professional credentials that can be used in a degree program, refer to
            the CCAF catalog at http://www.au.af.mil/au/ccaf/catalog/2011cat/.
      12.13.3. Credentialing Programs.
            CCAF offers nationally recognized credentialing programs that assist enlisted personnel in broadening their
            professional development. These programs directly support the mission of CCAF in that credentialing of Air
            Force enlisted personnel enhances combat readiness, contributes to recruiting and retention, and supports career
            transitions.   Additional    credentialing     information  is    available     on    CCAF‘s       website    at
            http://www.au.af.mil/au/ccaf/certifications.asp.
            12.13.3.1. Air Force Airframe and Powerplant (A&P) Certification Program. CCAF offers the Air Force
            A&P Certification Program to aircraft maintenance technicians in specific occupational specialties. The
            program is designed to bridge gaps between Air Force education, training, and experience, and Federal Aviation
            Administration (FAA) eligibility requirements per Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 65,
            Certification: Airmen Other Than Flight Crewmembers; Section 65.77, Experience Requirements. The program
            benefits the Air Force by broadening the skill sets and professional development of Air Force technicians,
            producing a more rounded and diverse aircraft maintenance professional. Furthermore, the FAA and Joint
            Service Aviation Maintenance Technician Certification Council (JSAMTCC) entered an agreement approving
            military appointees to administer all FAA certification knowledge tests to eligible military personnel. Through
            the agreement, all FAA certification knowledge tests are administered free of charge to active duty, guard, and
            reserve component personnel of the U.S. Armed Services; U.S. military retirees; U.S. military dependents; DoD
            civilians; and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) civilians.
            12.13.3.2. CCAF Instructional Systems Development (ISD) Certification Program. CCAF offers the ISD
            Certification Program for curriculum developers, writers, and managers formally assigned to CCAF affiliated
            schools to develop and manage CCAF collegiate-level credit-awarding courses. This certification is a
            professional credential that validates the E&T required to develop and manage CCAF collegiate courses and the
            practical experience gained in planning, developing, implementing, and managing instructional systems.
            12.13.3.3. CCAF Instructor Certification (CIC) Program. CCAF offers CIC for qualified instructors who
            teach CCAF collegiate-level credit-awarding courses at a CCAF affiliated school. The CIC is a professional
            credential that validates the instructor‘s extensive faculty development training, education, qualification, and
            practical teaching experience required to teach a CCAF course. The CIC Program consists of three specific
            levels of achievement. Qualified officer, enlisted, civilian, and other Service instructors are eligible for the CIC.
            12.13.3.4. Professional Manager Certification (PMC) Program. CCAF offers the PMC Program to qualified
            NCOs. The PMC is a professional credential that validates a noncommissioned officer‘s (NCO) advanced level
            of education and experience in leadership and management, as well as professional accomplishments, required
            to effectively manage Air Force personnel and critical national defense assets. The program provides a
            structured professional development track that supplements enlisted professional military education (EPME)
            and the CFETP.

12.14. Air Force Virtual Education Center (AFVEC).
      The AFVEC is the Air Force‘s premier website for providing information about education benefits. It provides
      students one-stop shopping for all higher education needs. Students may log on to the AFVEC to create their own
      account and gain access to online customer service tools. These services include the CCAF transcript request, CCAF
      degree progress report, and access to the civilian course conversion table. Students can also log on and view their
      personal education records, which include courses taken, tuition caps, and degree plans. This is the site for Airmen to
      apply on line for military tuition assistance for college courses. AFVEC is accessible through the Air Force Portal at
      https://www.my.af.mil/afvecprod/.

Section 12D—Air University Associate-to-Baccalaureate Cooperative Program (AU-ABC)
12.15. Vision.
      The vision of Air Force leaders is to provide distance learning and bachelor‘s degree opportunities for Airmen. The
      AU-ABC aligns with this Air Force vision and meets the AU near-term goal of providing enhanced educational
      opportunities for our enlisted force. The AU-ABC initiative establishes partnerships between the Air Force and
      accredited civilian higher education institutions to offer baccalaureate degree opportunities via distance learning. AU-
      ABC links Airmen who have completed associate degrees to ―military supportive‖ baccalaureate programs. AU-ABC
      applies CCAF associate degree credit toward baccalaureate degrees and requires participants to complete no more than
      60 semester hours after having earned an AAS degree. AU-ABC degree programs are linked to one or more Air Force-
      relevant degree programs currently offered by CCAF. To participate, registrants must be serving in the active duty Air
      Force, Air Force Reserves, or Air National Guard. Baccalaureate degree requirements may be completed after a
      student retires or separates from the Air Force.
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                         283

12.16. Program Plans.
      AU-ABC programs are classified in the three following categories:
      12.16.1. Category I.
            The program is designed for Airmen who have completed an AAS degree with the CCAF. These students are
            unconditionally guaranteed that no more than 60 semester hours of credit will be required to complete a
            baccalaureate degree.
      12.16.2. Category II.
            This option is designed primarily for Airmen who are currently enrolled in and pursuing a CCAF AAS degree.
            Students should complete the CCAF requirements in general education and program elective areas with
            specifically identified prerequisite course work listed in the partnering institution‘s baccalaureate degree plan.
            Upon completion of their CCAF degree, students are guaranteed that no more than 60 semester hours of credit
            will be required to complete a baccalaureate degree if they follow the posted AU-ABC degree plan.
      12.16.3. Category III.
            This option includes baccalaureate degree programs that require CCAF AAS graduates who have met all other
            AU-ABC specifications to complete more than 60 semester hours of credit beyond the AAS. Note: The degrees
            in this category must still link to one or more CCAF AAS programs. Go to
            https://rso.my.af.mil/afvecprod/afvec/SelfService/MyAFVEC.aspx for more information on AU-ABC.
Section 12E—Education
12.17. Educational Financial Assistance.
      The Voluntary Education Program supports long-range Air Force goals for maintaining a high-quality force and
      enhancing professional and personal development, recruitment, retention, and readiness. The Air Force offers three
      programs for enlisted personnel to help defray the cost of obtaining off-duty education:
      12.17.1. Military Tuition Assistance (TA).
            To assist individuals in furthering their education, the Air Force provides a TA program (with some restrictions)
            to all eligible Air Force members. As of 1 October 2002, the Air Force pays the cost of tuition and instructional
            fees at accredited institutions not to exceed the hourly and annual caps established by DoDI 1322.25, Voluntary
            Education Programs, and AFI 36-2306, Voluntary Education Program. These funds are not taxed thus lowering
            the tax deduction in an Airman‘s paycheck. Air Force members cannot use TA to purchase textbooks. Students
            using military TA whose tuition exceeds the semester hour cap may use the top-up benefit in their Montgomery
            GI Bill (MGIB) or Post 9/11 GI Bill to cover the remaining portion.
      12.17.2. Montgomery GI Bill.
            Eligible individuals who entered the service for the first time on or after 1 July 1985 are enrolled in the MGIB.
            Members who participate have their pay reduced by $100 a month for the first 12 months. What looks like a
            contribution of $1,200 is actually a little more than $900 because no taxes are paid on the $1,200. Participants
            may also elect to contribute an additional $600, which adds a maximum of $5,400 to the total benefit package.
            In-service use of the MGIB is permitted after 2 years of continuous active duty. Benefits expire 10 years after
            separation or retirement. Note: The amount of the total benefit is adjusted each year in relation to the cost of
            living index.
      12.17.3. Post-9-11 GI Bill.
            Eligible individuals who were on active duty on or after 11 September 2001 may choose to enroll in this new GI
            Bill. This program allows some Airmen to transfer GI Bill benefits to dependents if they have sufficient
            retainability. The details and benefits of this GI Bill are not the same as the MGIB. The decision to move to this
            program is irrevocable, so Airmen are requested to get full details from the Veteran‘s Administration at
            www.va.gov.
12.18. College Credit by Examination.
      Military members may earn college credits through examination. Individuals may earn up to as much as 60 semester
      hours of college credit at no financial cost by doing well on the examinations. However, the amount of semester hours
      accepted by an academic institution is dependent on the policies of the accepting institution. The two major types of
      examinations available to military personnel are as follows:
284                                                                                 1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
      12.18.1. Defense Activity for Nontraditional Education Support (DANTES).
            The DANTES subject standardized tests (DSST) are a series of tests for obtaining academic credit for college-
            level knowledge. The DSSTs are essentially course achievement tests. Each DSST is based on several textbooks
            commonly used for a course of the same or similar title. Some of the DSSTs include law enforcement, business,
            natural science, social science and history, and mathematics.
      12.18.2. The College-Level Examination Program (CLEP).
            The CLEP measures college-level competency. The ―general‖ CLEP tests measure college-level achievement in
            the five basic areas required for college freshmen and sophomores: English composition, humanities,
            mathematics, natural science, and social science and history. Additional tests are available in subject areas that
            include business, English literature, information systems, sociology, psychology, history, management, and
            foreign language.
12.19. Enlisted-to-Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) Program:
      12.19.1. The Enlisted-to-AFIT Program is a unique element of enlisted force development that enhances the future
      total force. In conjunction with other professional E&T programs, AFIT science, engineering, and management
      graduate degrees further develop an NCO‘s technical and managerial skills. The program‘s purpose is to enhance
      combat capability through career field core competency augmentation to provide the Air Force with highly proficient
      NCOs technically experienced in their career field and highly educated through AFIT graduate degree programs.
      Enlisted-to-AFIT Program degrees range from 18 to 24 months depending upon a student‘s undergraduate degree and
      prerequisite course work and are limited to master‘s degree programs offered at the resident campus, Wright-Patterson
      AFB OH.
      12.19.2. To be nominated for this program, the member must be an active duty TSgt (or select) or above with a
      minimum of 8 years of total active federal service. The nominee must have completed a 7- skill level upgrade, a CCAF
      degree, and a bachelor‘s degree from a regionally accredited institution. Additionally, he or she must have no adverse
      quality force actions within the previous 36 months, have a minimum of 24 months time on station, and must be able
      to obtain 3 years of retainability from the projected AFIT graduation date. For more information on the program,
      eligibility criteria, and nomination procedures, go to http://www.afit.edu/EN/ADMISSIONS/Default.cfm?l=enl.
12.20. Air Force Educational Leave of Absence (AFELA) Program.
      The AFELA Program is authorized by 10 U.S.C., Armed Forces, Section 708, for career Air Force military personnel
      only. This program is only used when an individual has completed as much as possible of a program through the off-
      duty education program and cannot complete the program during the current assignment or with an education
      deferment, or to accelerate academic requirements so an individual can apply for an AFIT degree or Air Force
      commissioning program. Members cannot use Air Force appropriated funds to pay for tuition, fees, books, or other
      supplies in connection with AFELA. In some cases, therefore, the use of leave is more advantageous for the individual
      than AFELA wherein TA could be made available. However, to defray tuition costs, members may use the in-service
      GI Bill education benefits. AFELA participants have 2 months of additional obligated service for each month of the
      leave of absence. Under AFELA, the new commitment is in addition to any other period of obligated service or active
      duty commitment to which the member is already committed. While participating in AFELA, an Air Force member is
      in educational leave status and entitled to basic pay only and is not paid a basic allowance for housing or a basic
      allowance for subsistence.
12.21. Commissioning Programs.
      Enlisted members can obtain a commission while on active duty through one of the various commissioning programs.
      A few of the most common programs include:
      12.21.1. Airman Education and Commissioning Program (AECP).
            The AECP allows active duty Airmen to earn a bachelor‘s degree to meet Air Force needs. Airmen selected for
            the AECP attend a civilian educational institution full time and remain on active duty. Depending upon the
            academic discipline, the Air Force allows up to 36 months to complete the work in a full-time course of study at
            a civilian educational institution. Upon graduation, members attend Officer Training School (OTS) for
            commissioning.
AFPAM36-2241         1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                     285

      12.21.2. Officer Training School (OTS).
            Eligibility for a commission through OTS requires military members to possess a baccalaureate or higher
            degree from an accredited college or university. AFI 36-2013, Officer Training School (OTS) and Enlisted
            Commissioning Programs (ECPS), contains specific guidance. Additionally, the base education services office
            has information and can provide assistance.
      12.21.3. United States Air Force Academy (USAFA).
            The USAFA offers a world-class education and a guaranteed career right out of college with no financial cost.
            However, upon graduation, individuals will incur an active duty service commitment. To be eligible, an
            individual must be a citizen of the United States, unmarried with no dependents, of good moral character, and at
            least 17, but less than 22 years of age, by July 1 of the year he or she would enter. Applicants who are not
            accepted to USAFA may receive an appointment to the preparatory school where skills in mathematics,
            English, and general sciences are emphasized. Successful completion of the preparatory school improves
            chances for appointments as a USAFA cadet but does not guarantee it.
      12.21.4. Scholarships for Outstanding Airmen to ROTC (SOAR) Program.
            SOAR offers active duty enlisted personnel the opportunity to earn a commission while completing their
            bachelor‘s degree as an Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) cadet. Those selected separate
            from the active duty Air Force join an AFROTC detachment and become full-time college students. The Air
            Force provides them with a tuition and fees scholarship of up to $15,000 per year, an annual textbook
            allowance, and a monthly nontaxable stipend. Award of this scholarship is for 2 to 4 years, depending on how
            many years remain in the student‘s bachelor‘s degree program. Airmen with some or no college credit may
            apply for the program. A limited number of SOAR selects are offered a scholarship with no tuition cap. This
            program is open to students in any major. Upon graduation and completion of the program, students are
            commissioned as second lieutenant and returned to active duty (typically within 60 days of commissioning) for
            at least 4 years.
      12.21.5. AFROTC Airman Scholarship and Commissioning Program (ASCP).
            This program allows military members to receive an AFROTC scholarship to attend a college or university of
            their choice, provided the college or university offers an AFROTC program. If selected for this program, the
            member is discharged from active duty and enlisted into the Air Force Inactive Obligated Reserve. Upon
            completion of the degree and the AFROTC requirements, the member receives an Air Force commission.
12.22. Conclusion.
      Supervisors at every level must ensure Airmen successfully accomplish their training requirements within established
      timelines. This chapter focuses on that responsibility, highlighting key training responsibilities, forms, and
      documentation. Supervisors must ensure their Airmen understand their educational benefits and options, including
      programs identified in this chapter: CCAF, AFVEC, financial assistance, college credit by examination, AFELA, and
      various commissioning programs.

                                               RESOURCE MANAGEMENT


Section 13A—Overview
13.1. Introduction.
      One of the primary roles of the noncommissioned officer (NCO) is that of a manager. With the constant focus on
      efficiency, the Air Force must get the greatest return from every investment. People are one of the most important
      resources NCOs manage. This chapter provides valuable information to consider when managing personnel. Also,
      everyone must safeguard Air Force property and protect it from fraud, waste, and abuse (FWA), and resource
      management requires all members be sensitive to environmental issues. This chapter provides an overview of resource
      management and identifies many of the Air Force environmental programs.

Section 13B—Managing Organizational Change
13.2. Introduction.
      The British created a civil service job in 1803 requiring a man stand on the cliffs of Dover with a spyglass. He was
      supposed to ring a bell if he saw Napoleon coming. Despite Napoleon‘s defeat in 1813, the job existed until 1945.
      13.2.1. What‘s wrong with this picture? The scenario illustrates an improvement, not to mention a significant cost
      saving opportunity that was ignored for over 130 years! We know change is inevitable. We know changes are taking
      place every day, all around us. We know change is easy, right? Wrong! As the scenario above shows, change is not
      automatic. It doesn‘t just happen.
      13.2.2. Change can be a complicated, often painful process. Senior enlisted leaders are in key positions to manage
      change. They have the authority and responsibility to lead and manage organizations, possess many years of
      experience, and have developed technical proficiency. However, as leaders they must also become proficient
      organizational change managers.
      13.2.3. This section explores the change process using the model proposed by renowned social psychologist Kurt
      Lewin, who recommended leaders view change as a three-stage process: unfreezing, changing, and refreezing.
13.3. Stage 1: Unfreezing.
      Leaders begin organizational change by unfreezing, which means going where the hurt is—where people feel the pain
      of poor policies or systems. Organizational change is defined as the adoption of a new idea or behavior by an
      organization; establishing new norms. These norms can be grouped in various categories, including technology, tasks,
      structure, and people norms: (1) technology: computers, test equipment, weapons systems, etc.; (2) tasks: general
      procedures, job steps, checklists, etc.; (3) structure: administrative procedures, evaluation systems, etc.; and (4)
      people: technical or leadership training, new jobs, etc.
      13.3.1. Regardless of what specifically needs to change, the first step is to recognize the need for change, a step that is
      far from easy. Change is appropriate when there is a perceived gap between what the norms are and what they should
      be. This perception starts the momentum to begin unfreezing.
      13.3.2. Unfreezing is a deliberate management activity to prepare people for change. Leaders create an environment
      where people feel the need for change. This is often the most neglected, yet essential part of unfreezing. A key factor
      in unfreezing involves making people knowledgeable about the importance of a change and how it will affect their
      jobs. Leaders must first generate a need in the people who will feel the greatest effect of the change. They do this by
      pointing out the problems or challenges with current operations. In many cases, people will want to stick to the old
      norms.
      13.3.3. The first reaction to change is usually resistance. Just as change is inevitable, so too is resistance to change. An
      essential element for successful change is having a good plan. Planning enables the change agent to anticipate
      problems, develop courses of action, and deal with resistance. Resistance can take many forms. Four of the most
      common are:
            13.3.3.1. Uncertainty. When faced with impending change, people often experience fear of the unknown, or
            see the change as a threat to their security: Can I do the new job? Can I operate the new equipment? Will I still
            have a job?
288                                                                                   1 OCTOBER 2013           AFPAM36-2241
            13.3.3.2. Self-interest. People often consider the power they currently have or their role in the existing
            environment and question the possible loss of power after the change is implemented.
            13.3.3.3. Different Perception/No Felt Need to Change. Even if you think people recognize the need for
            change, they may see the situation differently. Outwardly, they may support the change, but inwardly, they
            resist it.
            13.3.3.4. Over-Determination. Ironically, organization structure may be a barrier to change. For example, a
            mechanistic structure that relies on strict procedure and lines of authority may be so rigid that it inhibits change.
      13.3.4. When making change, success depends on managing and reducing resistance, and a change agent—you—
      becomes vitally important. Leaders must accept the role of change agent in order to manage change. Senior enlisted
      leaders have vast influence on their subordinates, peers, and superiors. Commanders and directors often call upon
      senior noncommissioned officers to change an organization, to ―make it happen.‖ Here are five proven methods
      leaders employ to reduce and manage resistance to change:
            13.3.4.1. Education and Communication. Educating people about the need for, and expected results of, a
            change should reduce their resistance. Open communication is necessary throughout the change process and
            helps reduce uncertainty.
            13.3.4.2. Participation and Involvement. Leaders reduce resistance by actively involving those affected in
            designing and implementing change. Involving people in the process may be time-consuming, but should help
            commit them to the new program.
            13.3.4.3. Facilitation and Support. Introduce the change gradually if possible. Provide additional training if
            needed. Reinforce and encourage people as much as possible. Remember the power of high expectations.
            13.3.4.4. Negotiation and Agreement. Offer incentives to those who continue to resist the change. Negotiated
            agreements can help remind everyone of the changes they agreed upon should resistance return.
            13.3.4.5. Coercion. This technique involves using force to get people to accept change. This is a last resort
            because compulsion negatively affects attitudes, and has long-term negative consequences. Coerced compliance
            requires constant leadership oversight to ensure the change remains in effect.
      13.3.5. There are usually many factors to consider, whether maintaining current norms (the status quo) or changing
      current norms. The change agent must analyze restraining (opposing) forces and devise ways to reduce them to
      overcome resistance (paragraph 13.3.4). At the same time, leaders must recognize and strengthen driving (supporting)
      forces—those forces pushing toward change. After analyzing the forces for and against change and developing a
      strategy to deal with them, leaders can attend to the change itself. Leaders improve the chance of success when they
      break the change into sequential steps. This approach provides visible success early, which may encourage people to
      support the rest of the change program.
      13.3.6. The unfreezing stage should be addressed whenever change is imminent. Careful planning is an essential
      element of unfreezing, improving chances of success and decreasing the likelihood of having to repeat the unfreezing
      stage. Your plan should include a set of evaluation standards to measure the degree of success or failure of the change.
      An evaluation with clear goals and objectives can help assess the success of change and help determine appropriate
      rewards when the change has been completed.
13.4. Stage 2: Changing.
      This stage involves modifying technology, tasks, structure, or distribution of people. This is the movement from the
      old state, or the previous norms, to the new state. During the changing stage, the organization installs new equipment,
      restructures work centers, or implements a new performance appraisal system. In short, changing is anything that
      alters the status quo.
      13.4.1. Your role as change agent in this stage is to monitor the change as it occurs and pay close attention to the
      people most affected by it. If you‘ve implemented the change too early, you‘ll know it by watching the people‘s
      reactions. If some link in the system isn‘t ready to handle the change, production may bog down. A few irate callers
      from other branches or units will let you know in a hurry!
      13.4.2. In this stage, ensure the plan unfolds as intended. Even the best plans go awry for one reason or another. It‘s
      important for you to be involved as the change is implemented and be ready to deal with problems that may arise.
      13.4.3. Provide support at this stage. Some people may be traumatized by the actual implementation, so you should
      provide encouragement and advice as needed. The same techniques used to overcome resistance to change (paragraph
      13.3.4) apply here, too.
AFPAM36-2241          1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                        289

      13.4.4. Go back to the unfreezing stage if the change isn‘t going well. It‘s better to back up and regroup than to press
      on with a change that causes more problems than it fixes. The change agent must decide whether (and when) to move
      forward. You must keep tabs on things or you won‘t be in a position to make this decision. Don‘t just plan to change,
      flip the switch, and let the chips fall where they may.
13.5. Stage 3: Refreezing.
      The final stage in the change process is refreezing. Just because you implemented a change and it appears to be going
      smoothly doesn‘t mean the job is done. You must lock in (or refreeze) the desired outcomes and the new norms so
      they become permanent.
      13.5.1. Without refreezing, people often return to the old ways. Consider an Airman who completes 7-skill level
      upgrade training and learns the proper way to perform key tasks in his or her work center. The proper way may differ
      from the way the work center completes the tasks. The Airman may be inclined to conform to the old way rather than
      make waves: old behaviors take over and nothing changes. Actively encouraging the use of new techniques and
      reinforcing them encourages others to use them, essentially freezing the new behavior. A critical step in refreezing is
      evaluating results. Did the change have the desired effect? If so, press on. If not, the new process may need more
      support, instruction, training, time, etc.
      13.5.2. Having developed strategies to evaluate results in Stage 1 of the change process, it‘s time to implement them.
      Positively reinforcing desired outcomes is crucial. Reward people when they do something right, this strengthens the
      correct behaviors and helps freeze them into place. In many cases, the change agent can call attention to the success of
      the change and show where it works. Highlighting successful change helps remove lingering resistance and prevents
      people from returning to the old way of doing things.
      13.5.3. In some cases, even what appears to be successful change management fails in the end. Years ago, a company
      bought new computer equipment for the typing pool, replacing the old electric typewriters with word processing
      stations. The new technology included color monitors, advanced software, and high-speed printers. Everyone was
      carefully trained. The new equipment was installed for half the typists at first, then the other half got their new
      equipment, and the supervisors (change agents) provided support and encouragement all the way. Soon the section was
      turning out professional correspondence in half the time it previously took. Successful change, you say. Unfortunately,
      it wasn‘t. To cut down on the noise from the printers, portable dividers were installed between workstations. This
      isolated the typists from coworkers, who used to be able to converse back and forth unimpeded. As a result, the
      previous social system, which was one of harmony, turned into one of unhappy isolation. Both the people and the
      work suffered, and the change plan had to be modified.
      13.5.4. Do you think the change agents anticipated this outcome and planned for it? Probably not, but they really
      weren‘t at fault. After all, no one can anticipate everything. The example serves to remind us of the importance of
      refreezing. The change agent must evaluate results, reinforce the desired outcomes, and make constructive
      modifications as needed.
      13.5.5. A change agent has a tough job. Carefully planning change, however, can make it as painless as possible.
      Managing change is one of the most important responsibilities you have. Using this three-stage process can help you
      manage the inevitable changes, rather than letting the changes manage you.

Section 13C—Traits of a Healthy Team
13.6. Introduction.
      As leaders, we must develop effective teams to accomplish the mission. While building effective teams, we must
      cultivate a healthy team spirit. The spirit in which a team operates influences every stage of team development and can
      ultimately determine whether mission goals are met. A healthy team spirit is the engine that runs high performance
      teams. Five critical attributes are present in all healthy teams: trust, ethical behavior, critical judgment, sharing, and
      cooperation. While each is essential in building a healthy team spirit, trust is the core of all healthy team interaction.
13.7. Trust:
      13.7.1. Trust is essential in forming any good relationship; teamwork requires good relationships with a high degree of
      trust. Team members must share mutual confidence in the integrity and ability of teammates. They also need to feel
      comfortable enough to take risks, think outside the box, and share their thoughts and ideas without fear of being shut
      down or discounted. Freedom to communicate openly, honestly, and directly within the group is the hallmark of a
290                                                                                  1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
      trust-based team. In her book "Teams at Work," author, organizational consultant, and Institute for Planning and
      Development founder Dr. Suzanne Zoglio wrote ―Nothing reduces trust in a group faster than members saying one
      thing within the group and something else outside the group. When members are assertive enough to say what they
      need to say directly to the appropriate people and to refrain from talking behind each other‘s backs, trust is enhanced.‖
      13.7.2. Team members may respond to other team members they do not trust by alienating them, ignoring their inputs,
      and withholding vital information. Trust is important in creating a healthy team because information needs to be
      shared and accepted in good faith. Feedback must also be exchanged between members in an open and sincere manner
      without fear of harsh criticism. Without trust, a team‘s efforts can be sabotaged and progress brought to a grinding
      halt. Leaders can promote a trusting atmosphere by being trustworthy and by trusting their workers. Additionally, by
      valuing individual differences and encouraging open and honest communication, leaders empower their teams to solve
      problems innovatively. Remember, trust is earned and can be lost.
13.8. Ethical Behavior.
      We lose trust in people because of behaviors that reduce our respect for them. Such behaviors are usually unethical
      and kill the spirit of the team. Ethical behaviors, on the other hand, conform to accepted principles of right and wrong
      that govern our profession. Team members who exhibit honesty, integrity, and concern for doing what is right behave
      ethically. In his book "Essentials of Management," author and Professor of Management, College of Business at
      Rochester Institute of Technology, Andrew J. DuBrin said ―To a strong team player, getting the group task
      accomplished is more important than receiving individual recognition.‖
13.9. Sharing Information:
      13.9.1. If teams are to succeed, they must openly share information inside and outside the group. This sharing of
      information involves both active listening and talking. According to Professor DuBrin, ―Information sharing helps
      other team members do their job well and also communicates concern for their welfare.‖ Leaders best demonstrate
      concern for the welfare of other team members when they actively listen. ―The active listener strives to grasp both the
      facts and feelings behind what is being said,‖ Professor DuBrin added. Active listening and information sharing
      encourage positive, open, and sincere communication among team members.
      13.9.2. Teams must communicate. Team members need to safely assert themselves and share their ideas. Teams that
      don‘t allow honest, open sharing quickly lose their effectiveness. As a result, some team members may purposely
      withhold vital information or disengage from the team. This may cause confusion, frustration, and the inability to
      complete taskings within teams. While sharing information between team members is essential in producing effective,
      well-thought-out plans, it is also essential for the leader to share information with team members. When leaders hold
      on to information, they can create an inaccurate, incomplete, or totally wrong picture of the expected outcome to team
      members. Information sharing yields better results. Leaders can increase team success by giving members complete
      access to all necessary data, discouraging the discounting of ideas and feelings, and encouraging the practice of active
      listening and valuing individual differences.
13.10. Critical Judgment.
      When we share information, someone is bound to criticize our ideas. For a team to be effective, constructive criticism
      should be accepted and encouraged. Professor DuBrin said, ―A high performance team demands sincere and tactful
      criticism among members. The willingness to accept constructive criticism increases self-awareness and improves
      team effectiveness.‖ Critical judgment enables teams to accept intra-group feedback (criticism) and outside
      evaluations, necessary to examine processes and practices. By using critical feedback, teams can redirect their focus
      and energy, and correct problems quickly rather than letting them intensify. Critical judgment is essential to ensure
      teams consistently focus in the right direction.
13.11. Cooperation:
      13.11.1. Cooperation is critical if teams are to combine diverse backgrounds, skills, and approaches to meet the
      challenges, customer requirements, and mission changes. Cooperation yields synergistic results and reduces the time it
      takes to reach a desired outcome. Dr. Zoglio said, ―At work there are so few solo opportunities; most challenges
      require the cooperation of many people. Team members must rely on each other to follow through on assignments,
      produce quality results, share creative ideas, and contribute to a pleasant work environment.‖ Leaders who encourage
      cooperation show team members that others have very important contributions to the goals of the unit. Team members
      may also come to understand how dependent they are on one another in reaching mission objectives.
AFPAM36-2241        1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                            291

      13.11.2. Dr. Zoglio further states that successful teams manage differences through win/win negotiating and reach
      decisions by consensus, rather than voting. Successful teams have few turf wars, little competitiveness, and an ability
      to forgive and forget. Cooperation breeds shared ownership for performance results, and achieving objectives
      increases team pride and a healthy team spirit. Conversely, competition hinders the cooperative process, as some team
      members attempt to outshine others to gain extra attention. Such ―all-starring‖ leads to in fighting, making the team
      less productive. ―All-starring‖ may also be evidence of a power struggle. To reduce power-play behavior, leaders
      should reemphasize each team member‘s specific roles and responsibilities, which eliminates potential barriers to
      cooperation.
13.12. Healthy Team Spirit Summary.
      Cultivating a healthy team spirit requires trust, ethical behavior, critical judgment, sharing, and cooperation. Trust is at
      the heart of any healthy team interaction. Team members must feel comfortable with, and confident in, one another to
      be able to fully participate and share their ideas and feelings. Positive group member behaviors establish the climate of
      trust needed to develop a healthy team spirit. Ethical behavior requires members do what is legally, morally, and
      professionally right for one another and the organization. Such behavior is essential to the communication a team
      needs to accomplish its goals. Leaders must establish a healthy team spirit to drive performance and develop effective
      teams to accomplish the mission.

Section 13D—Problem Solving
13.13. Overview.
      Air Force Smart Operations for the 21st Century (AFSO21) is a Service-wide initiative to shape the mindset and
      behaviors of all Airmen to one of continuous process improvement to achieve individual, unit, and institutional
      excellence and effectiveness. It is a transformational initiative that empowers Airmen to eliminate waste from every
      end-to-end process. AFSO21 encapsulates our intent to develop and institutionalize a comprehensive, strategic-level
      continuous process improvement (CPI) approach. CPI is a comprehensive philosophy of operations built around the
      concept that there are always ways a process can be improved to better meet the needs of the customer and
      organizations should constantly strive to make those improvements.
13.14. Continuous Process Improvement is Structured Problem Solving.
      At the core of the Air Force‘s process improvement effort is the eight-step problem-solving model. Rigorously
      applying the eight-step problem-solving model will help root out the waste in the day-to-day work of our Airmen and
      close the performance gaps in our processes. Waste and inefficiencies come in many forms and a significant amount of
      waste is a product of the processes and methods used. Many of these methods were never engineered in the first place.
      Instead, they have evolved over time around organizational boundaries and business rules. We can only fail in our
      improvement efforts if we hide problems instead of acknowledging them and tackling them head on. We must insist
      on taking a nonblaming approach in identifying and resolving problems. People are not the blame for inefficiencies in
      our processes; they are, however, in the best position to help identify barriers and inefficiencies in their day-to-day
      jobs.
13.15. Eight-Step Problem-Solving Process.
      The Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act (OODA) loop is an objective description of the decisionmaking process.
      AFSO21 takes the four steps of the OODA loop and further breaks it down into an eight-step problem-solving road
      map flexible enough to be effective at any level—Air Force, major command (MAJCOM), wing, and individual
      Airmen levels.
      13.15.1. Decisionmaking Phases. Table 13.1 illustrates four decisionmaking phases mapped to the AFSO21 eight-
      step problem-solving process.
      13.15.2. Identifying Improvement Opportunities. The success of any organization relies on its ability to identify
      internal opportunities for process improvements and a methodical approach to problem root cause analysis. Today‘s
      high demand of mission requirements with the continuing reality of shrinking resources make it imperative for a
      dynamic organization like the Air Force to not only identify a problem, but to understand why there is a problem.
      Consistently applying the eight-step problem-solving process will provide a concise and common format for
      presenting data, problem-solving facts, and information. This eases benchmarking and sharing of best practices when
      similar problems arise in other areas. The common structure provides a common language that more easily translates
      into a common understanding.
292                                                                                   1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241

                                    8      Standardize successful processes

      13.15.3. Step 1: Clarify the Problem—Observe:
            13.15.3.1. To understand the simplicity of how lean tools are used with the eight-step problem-solving process,
            let‘s apply AFSO21 methodology to a generic but common problem in many organizations. For this example
            we will use the squadron inprocessing process. This process is different at every squadron in the Air Force. In
            one squadron, the process may appear very adequate; however, the customer view can be very different.
            13.15.3.2. The critical first step to effective problem solving is to clearly understand the problem. Any problem-
            solving effort that begins with: ―We all know what the problem is, so what are we going to do about it?‖ is
            doomed for failure before it begins. Identifying and clearly defining a problem is not defeatist or whining, it is
            taking the time to know the enemy. Only after a problem is completely understood is the team in the best
            position to solve that problem. The first step to an effective solution is to establish a good problem statement.
            For this example, the problem statement is ―Current inprocessing time is excessive due to waste of redundant
            and obsolete process steps.‖ The tool used in the example is the suppliers, input, process, output, and customers
            (SIPOC) analysis. To combat waste, you must know who the true customer is. Waste will be defined from the
            eyes of the customer. The SIPOC diagram tool quickly and easily captures the current high-level view or ―as is‖
            state of the process being questioned. The bottom-line expectation for this step is to answer the questions of
            ―what‖ is currently happening, ―where‖ is it happening, ―when‖ is it happening, and ―who or what‖ is being
            impacted, and to exclude all opinions, solutions, or root causes.
            13.15.3.3. The following lean tools can assist the Air Force leader in deciding which problems should be
            tackled:
            13.15.3.3.1. Strategic Alignment and Deployment (SA&D). Provides a framework for ensuring resources and
            activities are linked to the key strategies, directives, and goals of the enterprise. Any individual problem-solving
            effort can have greater impact if it is coordinated with the rest of the organization.
            13.15.3.3.2. Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs, and Customers (SIPOC) Analysis. Provides a visual
            representation of a high-level process map. This analysis tool brings Airmen involved in a process together in a
            nonthreatening way that builds teamwork. The SIPOC analysis enables the team to see the start and end point of
            their process and helps them develop the scope of the process.
            13.15.3.3.3. Voice of the Customer. Only one entity can define value—the customer. Understanding who the
            customer is and what his or her needs are is a prerequisite to understanding whether or not those needs are being
            met.
            13.15.3.3.4. Value Stream Mapping. Overview of the process at any level to determine areas of needed focus.
            13.15.3.3.5. Go and See. Actually walking through the process or problem area provides firsthand data rather
            than secondhand opinions.
AFPAM36-2241    1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                          293

    13.15.4. Step 2: Break Down Problem and Identify Performance Gaps—Observe:
         13.15.4.1. Once the problem is identified and clearly defined, data should be gathered. Often, the more thorough
         the problem evaluation in this second step, the better a leader can judge the impacts of potential solutions
         offered later and evaluate solutions during implementation. For this example, the performance gap will be ―The
         checklist is not customer focused.‖ The tool used in this example is the performance gap analysis. The bottom-
         line expectation for this step is to provide data of a performance gap that makes visible the difference between
         current performance and customer expectations.
         13.15.4.1.1. The first step in assessing a problem area is gathering and reviewing the data on the process.
         Understanding what objective data is needed and what the data means is critical to ―root cause‖ problem solving
         and process improvement.
         13.15.4.1.2. Two lean tools that can assist the Airman in understanding what data is needed and the story it is
         trying to tell are:
         13.15.4.1.2.1. Performance Gap Analysis. This tool helps determine what the difference is between the level
         of performance seen today and the level of performance identified as needed tomorrow.
         13.15.4.1.2.2. Bottleneck Analysis (or Constraint Analysis). This tool helps determine which steps in the
         process are inhibiting the flow of the entire process. Sometimes referred to as the weakest link, or the slowest
         step.
    13.15.5. Step 3: Set Improvement Targets—Orient:
         13.15.5.1. Description. In the third step, process owners and/or project sponsors set improvement targets. For
         this example the improvement targets will be: (1) Single checklist with steps in logic and geographical order;
         and (2) Decrease wasted time by 25 percent and travel by 50 percent. The tool used in this step is the future
         state mapping and specific, measurable, attainable, results focused, and time bound (SMART) targets.
         13.15.5.2. Improvement Targets. Air Force leaders must create a vision of what an organization will strive to
         become. Targets define the performance levels required to make the vision a reality. Targets should be
         challenging but achievable and have balanced, specific, measurable, attainable, results focused, and time bound
         (SMART) characteristics. The bottom-line expectation for this step is to develop a SMART target.
         13.15.5.3. SMART Targets:
         13.15.5.3.1. Specific. Have desirable outputs based on subject matter expert knowledge and experience that are
         applicable to the process improvement activity.
         13.15.5.3.2. Measurable. Includes time frames and data obtainable from specific sources.
         13.15.5.3.3. Attainable. Resources are available; may have some risk, but success is possible.
         13.15.5.3.4. Results Focused. Linked to the mission, vision, and goals and are meaningful to the user.
         13.15.5.3.5. Time Bound. Provide step-by-step views versus giant leaps that are measurable at interim
         milestones.
    13.15.6. Step 4: Determine Root Causes—Orient:
         13.15.6.1. Air Force leaders often find themselves addressing problems that have been ―solved‖ many times
         before. This happens because problem-solving efforts were directed at the symptoms a problem presents rather
         than at the root cause of the problem. If an aircraft is constantly breaking down and cannot perform its mission,
         should the goal be to: reduce aircraft usage, improve repair cycle time, improve the quality of replacement parts,
         improve the aircraft design or improve the aircraft design process? Each step becomes increasingly difficult to
         evaluate, but each step also has a greater impact in preventing the recurrence of the problem. Root cause
         analysis is a tradeoff between digging as deeply as possible and finding the deepest point that is still within the
         team‘s sphere of influence. For this example, the root cause is ―Multiple checklists contained outdated and
         obsolete information.‖ The tool used in the example is the 5 Whys. The bottom-line expectation for this step is
         to use one of the six root cause analysis tools to enable a credible cause-and-effect relationship to the problem.
         13.15.6.2. Six tools can assist Airmen in determining the true root cause to a problem:
         13.15.6.2.1. 5 Whys. When you think you understand the cause of the problem, ask what caused the problem;
         that is, ask ―why‖ five times.
294                                                                                  1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
           13.15.6.2.2. Brainstorming. A cross-functional team that works in a problem area usually knows the root cause
           of the problem, although they do not realize it at the time. An open environment to throw out as many ideas as
           possible can be a useful way of pulling out information from the team members that they may not have realized
           was important.
           13.15.6.2.3. Pareto Analysis. A good rule of thumb is 80 percent of the problem will be caused by 20 percent
           of the inputs. Usually, the only inputs anyone can remember are the ones someone else is responsible for.
           Objectively graphing the data can point to the critical 20 percent.
           13.15.6.2.4. Affinity Diagrams. With thousands of inputs, outputs, and measures, finding a way to group like
           items can simplify a problem enough so it can be easily understood.
           13.15.6.2.5. Cause-and-Effect Diagrams. A quick and simple way to visually depict the relationship between
           specific categories of process inputs and undesirable outputs, the cause-and-effect diagram can help uncover the
           root cause to a problem.
           13.15.6.2.6. Control Charts. These charts objectively graph the output of a process over time. They usually
           include predefined upper and lower performance-level limits.
      13.15.7. Step 5: Develop Countermeasures—Decide:
           13.15.7.1. If the first four steps have been done correctly, this step should be the easiest of all. Even so, Air
           Force leaders should follow some very important guidelines to ensure the greatest possible likelihood of
           success. For this example, the countermeasures will be listed by priority in an implementation plan.
           13.15.7.2. The key principal to remember is that the impact of a solution is a combination of the quality of the
           solution and the acceptance of the solution by the people who must implement it. The relationship is similar to
           the following formula: (Quality of the solution) + (Acceptance) = Impact.
           13.15.7.3. An excellent solution that receives no support has zero impact. On the other hand, an average
           solution that receives some support will have some impact. With the entire first half of the eight-step problem-
           solving process focused on the left half of the equation, the Air Force leader must now present the solution in
           such a way as to gain its acceptance by those who must implement it. Leaders must select the most practical and
           effective countermeasures using the ―keep it simple‖ principle. Most importantly, build consensus with others
           by involving all stakeholders appropriately. By judiciously involving stakeholders in the solution creation step,
           the stakeholders develop a sense of ownership in the solution and, therefore, in the solution‘s success. This also
           prevents the complaint that the stakeholders are victims of the solution process. The bottom-line expectation for
           this step is to ensure the desired countermeasures address the root causes in step 4 while ensuring that the
           countermeasures are prioritized to enable implementation.
      13.15.8. Step 6: See Countermeasures Through—Act:
           13.15.8.1. Action. Action comes at the end of the OODA loop for a reason. The reactive leadership behavior, or
           ―knee-jerk reaction,‖ is part of an archaic problem-solving culture. Air Force leaders acting before they are
           ready for this step are likely to be as successful as the marksman with the motto, ―ready, fire, aim.‖ An action
           plan without action is a waste of resources and time. For an example of this step, we will address the specific
           action items listed by priority in an implementation plan.
           13.15.8.2. Key Questions. Air Force leaders must answer three key questions before taking action:
           13.15.8.2.1. Which CPI method best fits my situation?
           13.15.8.2.2. What is the best setting for implementing my solution?
           13.15.8.2.3. What CPI tools are most appropriate?
           13.15.8.3. CPI Method. AFSO21 incorporates aspects of four major CPI methods. Solutions may
           simultaneously draw from more than one of the CPI methods defined earlier.
           13.15.8.4. Setting. The largest factor in determining the most appropriate setting is the scope of effort required.
           13.15.8.4.1. Just Do It. Also called point improvement, this involves one person (or a small team) and can be
           accomplished in less than a day. Examples: Use torque wrenches instead of adjustable wrenches; route
           paperwork via email instead of through U.S. Postal Service or U.S. Air Force distribution channels.
           13.15.8.4.2. Rapid Improvement Event (RIE). An RIE consists of a small team of individuals, usually subject
           matter experts, and can be accomplished in less than 1 week. Examples: Improve aircraft servicing cycle time;
AFPAM36-2241     1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                          295

          improve first pass yield of brake shoe repairs. RIEs bring together cross-functional teams who actually do the
          work to improve a specific aspect.
          13.15.8.4.3. Improvement Project. This setting requires a large team and will be conducted over a long period
          of time. Examples: Shorten aircraft annual overhaul cycle time; write software to track annual overhauls.
          13.15.8.5. Tools. Dozens of lean process improvement tools from which an experienced practitioner can choose
          are available. Here are five of the most applicable tools. Tools should be selected based on how well they
          address the root causes identified in step 4.
          13.15.8.5.1. 6-S and Visual Management. This tool establishes a place for everything and makes it obvious
          when everything is not in its place.
          13.15.8.5.2. Standard Work. The bedrock foundation of CPI is standard work. Without standard work it is
          impossible to tell if improvements happen by chance or by our efforts.
          13.15.8.5.3. Cell Design. This tool designs how workers are arranged relative to the work and to each other.
          13.15.8.5.4. Error Proofing. Doing something right the first time is good. Making it impossible to do
          something wrong is better.
          13.15.8.5.5. Training. In addition to the method, setting, and tools in this step, there is almost always some
          form of training required to make the solution work. The training can be linked to the implementation plan
          developed in step 5 (paragraph 13.15.7). The training is usually needed at several levels simultaneously.
          Implementers and front line supervisors need the most intensive training with less detailed, but no less
          important training at echelons above. Customers and suppliers of the targeted process may also need training.
          The bottom-line expectation for this step is to develop a detailed implementation plan for each countermeasure
          that includes a point of contact (POC), status, and expected completion date.
    13.15.9. Step 7: Confirm Results and Process—Act:
          13.15.9.1. Step 7 compares the results of countermeasures with performance gaps and improvement targets.
          Also, it is important to confirm the improved process is sustainable and repeatable. Success is measured not
          only by the data, but by an excellent process capable of meeting the mission.
          13.15.9.2. Projects should be monitored for:
          13.15.9.2.1. Performance relative to the baseline developed in steps 1 and 2.
          13.15.9.2.2. Performance relative to SMART targets established in step 3.
          13.15.9.2.3. Performance relative to where you expected to be at this stage of the solution implementation.
          13.15.9.2.4. If you are not meeting targets by deadlines, you may need to return to step 4. Incorrect root cause
          determination is the most common mistake made by CPI efforts. The bottom-line expectation for this step is to
          answer three basic questions: (1) Was the target in step 3 achieved? (2) Was the performance gap in step 2
          closed? and (3) Was the problem in step 1 addressed?
    13.15.10. Step 8: Standardize Successful Processes—Act:
          13.15.10.1. Step 8 is the most commonly skipped and undercompleted of the entire problem-solving process. It
          is very tempting to take newfound knowledge and skills and immediately move on to the next improvement
          initiative, skipping the effort of ensuring the results stick. For the inprocessing example, the step is completed
          by placing the new inprocessing checklist on the squadron shared drive, removing all old versions, and sharing
          the success with other squadrons within the group to standardize the improvements.
          13.15.10.2. This step can be defined by answers to three questions:
          13.15.10.2.1. What is needed to standardize the improvements? Answer: Changes to technical orders, Air
          Force instructions, official instructions, equipment materiel, or using a different vendor or supplier.
          13.15.10.2.2. How should improvements and lessons learned be communicated? Answer: CPI management
          tool, key meetings, Air Force publications, message traffic, chain of command or communities of practice.
          13.15.10.2.3. Were other opportunities or problems identified by the problem-solving process? Answer:
          Restart the OODA loop. This should be the Air Force leader‘s first instinct as the OODA loop is infinite.
296                                                                                 1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
            13.15.10.3. The never-ending cycle of the OODA loop and the CPI closely parallel one another. Effective
            problem solving must follow the OODA process. Attempting to skip, reorder, or shortcut steps invariably leads
            to suboptimal solutions at best and outright failure at worst. Following the eight-step problem-solving process
            will ensure actions lead to the desired results with an absolute minimum of wasted effort. It will also ensure the
            results are aligned with the needs of the organization. All of this leads to a virtuous nesting of organizational
            purpose and activities and increased Air Force combat effectiveness. The bottom-line expectation for this step is
            that standard work is implemented, policy or instruction codifies the improvement, actions are taken to share the
            improvement with other organizations, and a recurring and reportable performance measure is left in place.
      13.15.11. Summary.
            The OODA loop and AFSO21 along with the Air Force eight-step problem-solving process model is a simple,
            yet thorough, method of continuous process improvement. The method is flexible enough to be effective at any
            level from Headquarters Air Force, to the individual Airmen.

Section 13E—Managing Resources Other Than Personnel
13.16. Resource Management System (RMS):
      13.16.1. RMS Defined.
            RMS does not refer to a single system. Instead, the Air Force RMS involves various systems focusing on
            outputs and resources used, managers effectively using resources, measuring actual performance compared to
            planned performance, and using financial plans and accounting to enhance management controls at each
            organizational level. The RMS provides a way to establish priorities, choose policies, and act to get the desired
            results and required resources at an acceptable cost. RMS elements include the execution plan, management and
            accounting systems, participatory and committee management, resource management teams, and resource
            management training.
      13.16.2. RMS Duties.
            Air Force managers oversee activities that cost money. However, in terms of resources, RMS duties refer to the
            stewardship of money, manpower, and equipment. Being an effective steward involves more than legal
            accountability. Headquarters U.S. Air Force and MAJCOMs make decisions about using resources. Although
            base-level resource managers do not control initial allocation of all their resources, they must effectively
            manage these resources.
            13.16.2.1. Commanders. Financial management is inherent to command. Commanders review, validate, and
            balance the execution plan to ensure successful financial management. They must actively review financial
            programs for each work center (responsibility center) that reports to them and improve resource management by
            inquiring about program conditions, reviewing causes, weighing alternatives, and directing action. They must
            also ensure RMS success by allocating sufficient resources to RMS training and resource management team
            efforts.
            13.16.2.2. Comptrollers. Comptrollers support the organization‘s mission and the Air Force by providing
            sound financial management and advice to the commander and staff. They promote responsible and proper
            financial management to ensure economical and efficient use of resources consistent with statutory and
            regulatory requirements. They apply policies and procedures that enable the organization to carry out
            accounting, budget, and cost functions.
            13.16.2.3. Responsibility Center Managers. Responsibility center managers plan, direct, and coordinate
            subordinate organizations‘ activities. They analyze subordinate organizational plans, identify imbalances in
            resource distribution, analyze alternative actions, and balance programs.
            13.16.2.4. Cost Center Managers. The cost center is the basic production flight or work center. The cost center
            manager regulates the consumption of work hours, supplies, equipment, and services to do the tasks within their
            cost center. Cost center managers shift resources to or from various production tasks within the cost center to
            ensure the proper mix or to provide the emphasis required.
            13.16.2.5. Resource Advisors (RA). RAs monitor and help prepare resource estimates. They help develop
            obligations and expense fund targets, monitor the use of resources in daily operations compared to projected
            consumption levels, and serve as the primary POCs on resource management matters pertaining to their
            responsibility center. RAs are appointed in writing by the responsibility center manager.
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                            297

      13.16.3. The Financial Management Board.
            Established by the senior or host commander at each base, the financial management board determines program
            priorities and ensures effective allocation of resources. The financial management board reviews and approves
            or disapproves recommendations made by the financial working group to ensure balanced, valid financial
            programs and to consider all known or anticipated requirements.
      13.16.4. The Financial Working Group.
            Composed of both line and staff RAs and responsibility center managers, the financial working group manages
            commodities and resources integral to the operating activities of the base or unit. The financial working group
            develops requirements and revisions for the base or unit execution plan, reviews all appropriated fund execution
            plans, and makes recommendations to the financial management board for final approval. Additionally, the
            financial working group presents recommendations to the financial management board for unfunded
            requirement prioritization and fund target adjustments between responsibility centers, and base-level budgetary
            guidance. The financial working group provides technical guidance to base activities on using their primary
            responsibility resources.
13.17. Effective Use of Government Property:
      13.17.1. Supply Discipline.
            Air Force members must have a supply discipline to conserve, protect, and maintain available Government
            supplies, equipment, and real property for operational requirements. The Air Force‘s mission makes it
            imperative that all military and civilian personnel operate and maintain Government systems, equipment,
            supplies, and real property in the best possible condition, in constant readiness, and in the absolute minimum
            quantity necessary to accomplish assigned tasks. Commanders and supervisors at all levels are responsible for
            prudent management, control, storage, and cost-effective use of Government property under their control.
      13.17.2. Roles.
            Commanders, subordinates, supervisors, and individuals must:
            13.17.2.1. Accurately maintain property records to reflect a current inventory and condition of property.
            13.17.2.2. Ensure personnel carefully and economically use and safeguard property.
            13.17.2.3. Provide adequate security, protection, and storage for property.
            13.17.2.4. Make recommendations for preventing fraud, waste, and abuse.
      13.17.3. Custodial Management of Public Property.
            A property custodian is any person designated by the organization commander or chief of staff agency
            responsible for Government property in his or her possession. A custodian must plan and forecast requirements
            to meet mission goals, prepare and forward materiel requests to the proper agency, sign custody receipts or
            listings for property charged to his or her organization, report losses or irregularities relating to property to his
            or her immediate commanders or accountable officers, and take action to reconcile and correct property records.
            A custodian may be held liable for the loss, destruction, or damage of any property or resources under his or her
            control.
13.18. Financial Management:
      13.18.1. Use of Resources.
            Air Force commanders and supervisors are responsible for the efficient and economical use of all resources in
            their organizations. Commanders and supervisors directly influence the budgeting, allocation, composition, and
            distribution of these resources. It should be noted that every Air Force member is directly involved in and
            responsible for managing resources.
      13.18.2. Cost-free Resources.
            In the following types of instances, everyone has a principal responsibility to ensure resources are used in the
            most cost-effective manner. Keep in mind, all Air Force resources, at one time or another, had some kind of
            cost charged to get into the DoD inventory. Some resources may appear to be cost-free assets because Airmen:
            13.18.2.1. Did not have to pay out funds to obtain the resources.
298                                                                                  1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
            13.18.2.2. Neither had the authority to control allocation (real property, weapons systems, and manpower) nor
            change the composition of total resources allocated.
      13.18.3. The Operating Budget.
            The operating budget covers costs associated with the operation of all Air Force organizations. The approval by
            higher headquarters gives obligation authority to accomplish the mission. The budget program operates on a
            fiscal year (FY) basis. (FY represents the period beginning the first day of October and ending the last day of
            the following September [1 October through 30 September].)
13.19. Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (FWA):
      13.19.1. FWA Defined.
            The Air Force loses millions of dollars in money and resources every year due to individuals abusing the
            system, wasting precious resources, and committing acts of fraud. FWA is:
            13.19.1.1. Fraud. Any intentional deception designed to unlawfully deprive the Air Force of something of
            value or to secure from the Air Force for an individual a benefit, privilege, allowance, or consideration to which
            he or she is not entitled. Such practices include, but are not limited to:
            13.19.1.1.1. Offering, paying, accepting bribes or gratuities, or evading or corrupting inspectors or other
            officials.
            13.19.1.1.2. Making false statements, submitting false claims, or using false weights or measures.
            13.19.1.1.3. Using deceit, either by suppressing the truth or misrepresenting material facts, or deprive the Air
            Force of something of value.
            13.19.1.1.4. Adulterating or substituting materials and falsifying records and books of accounts.
            13.19.1.1.5. Conspiring to carry out any of the actions in paragraphs 13.19.1.1.1 through 13.19.1.1.4.
            13.19.1.1.6. Engaging in conflict of interest cases, criminal irregularities, and the unauthorized disclosure of
            official information relating to procurement and disposal matters. Note: For purposes of this pamphlet, the
            definition can include any theft or diversion of resources for personal or commercial gain.
            13.19.1.2. Waste. The extravagant, careless, or needless expenditure of Air Force funds or the consumption of
            Air Force property that results from deficient practices, systems controls, or decisions is waste. Waste also
            includes improper practices not involving prosecutable fraud. Note: Consider wartime and emergency
            operations when explaining possible waste. For example, legitimate stockpiles and reserves for wartime needs,
            which may appear redundant and costly, are not considered waste.
            13.19.1.3. Abuse. The intentionally wrongful or improper use of Air Force resources is abuse. Examples
            include misuse of rank, position, or authority that causes the loss or misuse of resources such as tools, vehicles,
            computers, or copy machines.
      13.19.2. Preventing Fraud, Waste, and Abuse.
            Preventing FWA is of primary concern. Detection and prosecution serve to deter fraudulent, wasteful, or
            abusive practices; however, the key element of the program is to prevent the loss of resources. The Secretary of
            the Air Force, Inspector General (SAF/IG), provides policy guidance, develops procedures, and establishes and
            evaluates the Air Force Complaints and FWA programs. In turn, inspectors general (IG) at every level are
            responsible for establishing and directing the Air Force Complaints and FWA programs. Air Force personnel
            have a duty to promptly report FWA to an appropriate supervisor or commander, to an IG or other appropriate
            inspector, or through an established grievance channel. FWA complaints may be reported to the Air Force Audit
            Agency, the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), security forces, or other proper authorities.
            Further, all military and civilian members must promptly advise the AFOSI of suspected criminal misconduct or
            fraud. The AFOSI investigates criminal allegations.
      13.19.3. Fraud, Waste, and Abuse Complaints:
            13.19.3.1. Resolution. As with personal complaints, Air Force members should try resolving FWA issues at the
            lowest possible level using command channels before addressing them to a higher level or the IG. Individuals
            may submit:
            13.19.3.1.1. FWA disclosures by memorandum, in person, or by FWA hotlines.
            13.19.3.1.2. Complaints anonymously.
AFPAM36-2241      1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                        299

           Note: Making a disclosure or complaint requires factual, unbiased, and specific information. Individuals must
           understand they are submitting official statements within Air Force channels. Therefore, they remain subject to
           punitive action (or adverse administrative action) for knowingly making false statements and for submitting
           other unlawful communications. Information in a disclosure or complaint to an IG is protected.
           13.19.3.2. Complainant Privacy. The complainant‘s privacy is safeguarded to the maximum extent practicable
           to encourage voluntary cooperation and promote a climate of openness in identifying issues requiring leadership
           intervention. The IG has the responsibility to safeguard the personal identity and complaints of individuals
           seeking assistance or participating in an IG process such as an investigation. While this does not mean the
           communications made to an IG are privileged or confidential, it does mean that disclosure of those
           communications (and the identity of the communicant) is strictly limited to an official need-to-know basis.
           13.19.3.3. Disclosure. This information is not disclosed unless required by law or regulation, when necessary to
           take adverse action against a subject, with the approval of the SAF/IG.
           13.19.3.4. Summary of the Results. Individuals making a complaint may request a summary of the results
           from the office to which the complaint was made. However, witnesses (including complainants and subjects) do
           not have unrestricted access to reports, complainants, and subjects, or any other case file information by virtue
           of their status as a witness. They have access to IG records as provided for by the Freedom of Information Act
           (FOIA) and Privacy Act (PA).
           13.19.3.5. Whistleblower Rights. Whistleblower witnesses have additional rights. The nature of the allegation
           and findings will determine what information is releasable. All information released is according to FOIA and
           PA. ―Third-party‖ complainants are not entitled to a response regarding alleged wrongs not directly affecting
           them unless authorized to receive via a FOIA or a PA release.
           13.19.3.6. IG Channels. Any complaint or disclosure received by an IG that is more appropriate in another
           channel may be referred to that channel by the receiving IG. When IGs refer complaints to command or other
           more appropriate resolution channels, IGs notify complainants, except anonymous complainants, of the referral.
13.20. Air Force Environmental Commitment:
     Leadership at all levels and across all mission operations and support organizations must use the Air Force
     Environmental Management System‘s (EMS) approach to comply with environmental laws, regulations and policy,
     reduce risks to the mission, and continuously improve environmental management performance. Operationalizing
     environmental management means ensuring that environmental quality is a consideration by Airmen in all activities
     the Air Force undertakes.

     13.20.1. Air Force Policy.
           The U.S. Air Force is a leader and devoted guardian of the environment. As trustee to over 8 million acres of
           natural habitat, the Air Force takes considerable measures to defend and enhance America‘s rich natural
           resources and cultural heritage. Over the last 20 years, the Air Force has followed a compliance-based approach
           to environmental management resulting in an unparalleled record of responsiveness to regulation, community
           interests, and ecological needs. Yet, to meet current and future mission requirements, the Air Force
           Environmental Program must ensure environmental resources, such as air, land, and water, are available to meet
           operational needs. This approach allows the Air Force to sustain, restore, and modernize its environmental
           resources, or "natural infrastructure," in full compliance and support of military readiness challenges.
     13.20.2. DoD and Air Force Programs.
           Per Executive Order (EO) 13423, Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation
           Management, the DoD and Air Force established and maintained an EMS. See Figure 13.1 for the EMS vision,
           programs, and guidance. The EMS sustains and enhances mission capability by:
           13.20.2.1. Maintaining compliance with all applicable environmental laws, regulations, and policy
           requirements.
           13.20.2.2. Reducing compliance burden by implementing pollution prevention (P2) solutions that reduce the
           quantity and impact of pollutants.
           13.20.2.3. Sustaining natural, cultural, built, and human resources.

Section 13F—Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE)
13.21. Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution Philosophy.
      The ultimate objective of the PPBE process is to provide the best mix of forces, equipment, and support attainable
      within fiscal constraints according to DoD Directive 7045.14, The Planning, Programming, and Budgeting System
      (PPBS). The goal of the PPBE process is to achieve the defense objectives established by the President and the
      Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) in the strategic planning and joint planning guidance. The Air Force uses a unique
      process for implementing the PPBE—the Air Force corporate structure. This structure increases management
      effectiveness by applying judgment and experience to programs, resource limitations, and other program adjustments.
      This enables senior leadership to assess alternative ways to achieve the PPBE objective. The Air Force develops its
      program to achieve defense objectives established by the President and the SECDEF as well as internal Air Force
      strategic planning objectives. The formulation of the Air Force budget is a complicated and time-consuming endeavor.
      PPBE is a shared process within the Air Force with significant responsibility delegated to the Director of Programs,
      Deputy Chief of Staff for Plans and Programs (AF/A8P), and the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Budget, Office of the
      Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Financial Management and Comptroller (SAF/FMB).
13.22. Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution Process.
      The PPBE process is the DoD‘s resource allocation system. This process has a framework that decides on future
      capabilities and provides an opportunity to reexamine prior decisions in light of evolving threats, economic conditions,
      and security concerns. Finally, PPBE is an iterative process consisting of four interrelated and overlapping phases:
      planning, programming, budgeting, and execution.
      13.22.1. Planning.
            The Air Force translates top-down guidance into meaningful plans and requirements for which a program for
            the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) can be developed. Planning defines and examines alternative
            strategies and analyzes external conditions and trends. Planning provides the means to anticipate changes and
            understand the long-term implications of near-term choices and decisions. Streamlined planning and assessment
            documents help prioritize objectives, assess strategies, and provide the link between planning and programming.
            Within the concept of PPBE, planning also provides a program objective against which the Air Force can
            measure program execution success.
      13.22.2. Programming.
            Through the programming processes, the Air Force and other military departments link planned requirements
            with the resources needed to provide them. Inevitably, this will involve tradeoffs beyond those agreed to in the
            planning process. By programming, the Air Force matches available resources (fiscal, manpower, and materiel)
            against validated requirements to achieve the strategic plan and submit program proposals. Planning policies
            and guidance are addressed and initial program costs are established. The key objective of programming is to
            develop a balanced, capabilities-based Air Force program in the form of the Air Force program objective
            memorandum (POM). In addition, through the programming processes, the Air Force defends its POM during
            program review and budget review and adjusts the program as a result of the Office of the Secretary of Defense
            (OSD) reviews and changing national and international situations.
      13.22.3. Budgeting.
            The budgeting phase of PPBE occurs concurrently with the programming phase. Each DoD component submits
            its proposed budget estimate simultaneously with its POM. The budgeting phase (formulation and justification)
            provides a platform for a detailed review of a program‘s pricing, phasing, and overall capability to be executed
            on time and within budget. The budgeting process principally addresses the years to be justified in the
            President‘s budget. Three things happen in the preparation of the budget estimate submission (BES). First, Air
            Force budget analysts identify situations where the program has put Air Force resources at risk of OSD or
            Congressional reduction. Second, the comptroller applies the latest inflation figures, flying hour and manpower
            rates, etc. Third, the program is put into the OSD budget format and budget justification documentation is
            prepared. Once these steps are complete, the final position is called the POM/BES or Program Budget Review.
            The budgeting phase continues with the Program Budget Review submission and fact-of-life changes via
            notification document in the off-year. SAF/FMB is the Air Force lead for budget and budget execution.
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                          303

      13.22.4. Budget Execution.
            Budget execution focuses on running the Air Force day to day. Execution is carried out at the Headquarters Air
            Force (HAF), field operating agency (FOA), MAJCOM, wing, and unit level. The Air Force MAJCOMs
            (including the HAF) are allocated their share of obligation authority to execute their missions. Because the
            budget being executed in any given year was actually compiled over a year earlier, it is logical to assume that
            some assumptions on which the budget was based will have changed. Because change is anticipated, Congress
            allows some flexibility within the operating budgets to move resources without requiring their permission. One
            key part of budget execution is the MAJCOM‘s Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Operation Plan. Air Force
            program execution is reviewed during MAJCOM budget execution reviews in February, April (concurrent with
            the internal Air Force midyear review), and July.
13.23. Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution Summary.
      Every SNCO contributes to the PPBE process. Within this system, SNCOs help establish and forecast a budget to
      ensure sufficient funds are available to accomplish the mission. Thoughtful and accurate estimates on the local level
      are extremely important in reflecting the overall Air Force needs. Wise day-to-day resource management is essential to
      having an effective PPBE process.

Section 13G—SNCO Day-to-Day Resource Management
13.24. Financial Management.
      To many, some resources may appear to be cost-free assets because they may not either control the determination or
      allocation of these resources (real property, weapon systems, and manpower) or may not have the authority to change
      the mix of the total resources allocated. In these instances, the SNCO‘s principal responsibility is to ensure these
      resources are used in the most cost-effective manner.
13.25. Resource Management Team.
      The resource management team is a problem-solving team designed to improve base-level resource management by
      providing training and specific assistance. The aim is to train and motivate personnel by observing and crossfeeding
      innovative resource management methods and ideas. Crossfeeding information is very important. Identifying various
      resource management practices and techniques observed throughout the base, recommending improvements, and
      making this information available upgrades financial awareness and skills. The key to a successful resource
      management team is open information exchange and the base‘s application of its own expertise in identifying and
      resolving resource management problems.
13.26. Resource Management Team Composition.
      The base comptroller decides the membership and selects team members for each responsibility center visit. Resource
      management teams only include members who have a direct functional interest in improving the effectiveness and
      efficiency of the visited responsibility center. Normally, the visited responsibility center would be given the chance to
      decide the resource management team makeup for their assistance visit. The team usually consists of consultants from
      the financial analysis, financial service office, supply, transportation, base civil engineer, contracting, logistics,
      communications, management engineering, and personnel offices.

Section 13H—Government Property and Equipment
13.27. General Responsibilities:
      13.27.1. The Air Force mission requires that all military and civilian personnel operate and maintain Government
      systems, equipment, supplies, and real property in the best possible condition, in constant readiness, and in the
      absolute minimum quantity necessary to accomplish assigned tasks.
      13.27.2. Commanders must manage public property under their control, including proper care and use, provide
      instructions to subordinates on their specific responsibilities, and maintain records that may be audited. Commanders
      and supervisors establish controls to eliminate uneconomical equipment management, ensure all personnel are taught
      proper care and safeguard principles, and enforce these principles. Logistics readiness squadrons (LRS) offer training
      on a variety of topics for different management levels. Commanders appoint representatives and ensure the
      representatives attend the proper training. For example, primary and alternate equipment custodians attend mandatory
      Block III computer-based training (CBT) accompanied by a supplemental Block III training provided by the LRS
      equipment accountability element.
304                                                                                    1 OCTOBER 2013           AFPAM36-2241
      13.27.3. The Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS) provides a standard equipment management system
      applicable to all Air Force activities. This system is Web-enabled and requires a password for access. AFEMS
      provides worldwide visibility of all in-use and warehoused equipment assets and is used to report capitalized asset
      depreciation, determine equipment requirements based on Air Force allowance standards, support the budget and buy
      program, and report equipment types and quantities required to accomplish the mission. The allowance standards are
      provided both on line in the AFEMS and off line via compact disk. The allowance standards include specific items and
      authorized quantities required for the wartime and peacetime needs of each unit.
13.28. Property Accounting.
      The organization commander or equivalent designates a property custodian for Government property used by the unit
      and listed on allowance standard documents. Upon assuming responsibility and at least annually, the designated
      property custodian must perform an inventory of all assets. The custodian signs the custodian authorization/custody
      receipt listing (CA/CRL) acknowledging completion of the inventory and signifying all items listed are being used
      properly and maintained in serviceable condition. After the inventory is completed, the custodian signs the
      acknowledgement of responsibility block which allows the custodian to become accountable for the property
      physically in possession, then obtains the commander‘s signature as validation that the inventory took place and
      actions are underway to resolve discrepancies. The property custodian is relieved of responsibility only when the
      account is transferred to another custodian, issues or turns in items and obtains a signed receipt, or provides authorized
      adjustment documents (turn-in receipts, transfer documents, etc.).
13.29. Report of Survey (ROS).
      A report of survey is used to research and investigate the cause of loss, damage, destruction, or theft of Government
      property and to determine if it was attributable to an individual‘s negligence or abuse. The final report is used to assess
      financial liability against the persons responsible or to relieve them from liability if there is no evidence of negligence,
      willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use of the property. The ROS also serves as a source document to adjust
      accountable records and provides a tool for commanders to identify deficiencies that require corrective action to
      prevent recurring incidents. AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force Property, identifies procedures for
      processing a ROS and implementing the ROS program.
      13.29.1. When to Complete a Report of Survey:
             13.29.1.1. With some exceptions, a ROS must be completed for all Government property lost, damaged,
             destroyed, or stolen. The property can be real or personal. Air Force real property includes buildings and items
             attached to them, such as air-conditioners and compressors. Personal property is anything that is not real
             property, such as parkas, tools, desks, equipment, and vehicles.
             13.29.1.2. A report of survey is not necessary when:
             13.29.1.2.1. The individual responsible for the loss or damage makes voluntary payment, and loss, damage,
             destruction, or theft of property is $500 or less. This policy does not prevent the initiation of an ROS if the loss
             is less than $500, if there is evidence of negligence, or if it is a systematic loss of property by the same
             individual over a period of time.
             13.29.1.2.2. Investigation of the loss, damage, or destruction of a vehicle indicates no evidence of gross
             negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use. The commander may still take action against
             individuals in these cases using punitive or administrative options.
             13.29.1.2.3. Assessment of financial liability will not be used instead of or as a form of disciplinary action.
      13.29.2. Initiating a Report of Survey:
             13.29.2.1. Generally, the organization possessing the lost or damaged property is responsible for initiating a
             ROS even if the property is deployed or issued on a hand-receipt outside the organization.
             13.29.2.2. Depending on the organizational structure, the commander normally initiates the proceedings by
             appointing an investigating official. The investigating official will be an officer, SNCO, or civilian employee
             (GS-7, WG-9, WL-5, or WS-1 or above). The investigator must be a disinterested, impartial individual who has
             no interest or involvement in the custodianship, care, accountability, or safekeeping of the property in question.
AFPAM36-2241        1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                         305

      13.29.3. Report of Survey Investigation.
            At a minimum, the investigating official will perform the following steps during an investigation:
            13.29.3.1. Develop the facts in the case which will lead to the findings and recommendations. The investigator
            must interview any persons with knowledge of the case if they are in the immediate area. This includes the
            person who may have lost, damaged, destroyed, or stolen the property.
            13.29.3.2. Obtain written statements from persons interviewed. These statements will be sworn to in accordance
            with the Manual for Courts-Martial, Appendix 2, Section 936. This section authorizes the investigator to swear
            witnesses.
            13.29.3.3. Ensure the findings and the recommendations are supported by the testimony of persons involved and
            that the testimony leads logically to the findings and recommendations.
            13.29.3.4. Determine if financial liability should be assessed based strictly on the facts and circumstances of the
            case. If financial liability is recommended, it will be based on the value of the property involved. It will not be
            tempered by the fact that financial liability generally is limited not to exceed 1 month‘s pay or by statements
            made to the investigating officer by the person involved that the assessment of financial liability will cause
            personal hardship. Note: Reducing the recommended assessment of financial liability is a command prerogative
            and not within the purview of the investigating officer.
      13.29.4. Liability:
            13.29.4.1. All Air Force members and employees can be held liable for the loss, damage, or destruction of
            Government property proximately caused by their negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized
            use.
            13.29.4.2. Persons who have lost, damaged, destroyed, or stolen Government property valued at $500 or less
            may voluntarily pay for the property.
      13.29.5. Processing the Report of Survey:
            13.29.5.1. After the investigation is complete, the investigating official allows the persons involved to review
            the case and provide verbal or written information to refute the findings and recommendations. In the process of
            refuting the findings of a ROS, an Airman may seek advice from the local area defense counsel.
            13.29.5.2. The ROS is then processed to the appointing authority to assign financial responsibility against the
            individual charged or relieve him or her from responsibility. If financial responsibility is to be assessed, refer
            the ROS to the legal office for review.
            13.29.5.3. At the time the ROS is submitted for acknowledgment by the individual charged, he or she is advised
            that the ROS action may be appealed to the next level in the chain of command above the person who assigned
            the financial liability assessment.

Section 13I—Facility Management
13.30. Installation Commander Responsibilities.
      The installation commander has overall responsibility and accountability for the operation of an Air Force installation.
      Per AFPD 32-10, Installations and Facilities, the MAJCOM and installation commander, assisted by the base civil
      engineer:
      13.30.1. Ensure the effective and efficient use of Air Force real property.
      13.30.2. Plan and program all O&M-funded unspecified minor military construction and maintenance and repair for
      real property requirements necessary to properly support assigned missions and people (including tenants) and to care
      for and preserve Air Force real property.
13.31. Responsibilities of the Using Organization:
      13.31.1. Facility management begins with the using organization. The using organization unit commander will ensure
      alterations, additions, or new construction is approved by the base civil engineer or wing commander when required.
306                                                                                    1 OCTOBER 2013           AFPAM36-2241
      13.31.2. The unit commander designates in writing an officer, E-4 and above, or civilian equivalent, as primary and
      alternate facility managers for each facility assigned to the organization. In multipurpose facilities, the major user
      should be assigned as the primary facility managers. Any other organization using a portion of a multipurpose facility
      is allowed to appoint an alternate facility manager for its area. Facility managers submit work requirements either
      verbally or in writing to the base civil engineer customer service unit.
      13.31.3. All facility modification and repair work requires facility managers to submit an AF Form 332, Base Civil
      Engineer Work Request. AF Form 332 helps prevent conflict with other work planned for a facility and ensures the
      work meets fire, safety, health, and environmental standards.
13.32. Base Civil Engineer Squadron Responsibilities:
      13.32.1. The base civil engineer operations flight serves as the single point of contact for all maintenance, repair,
      alterations, and new construction. The facility managers may call in a work request directly to the operations flight job
      control controller, element, function, or identify needed work to the civil engineer facility maintenance manager
      during a periodic facility inspection. Operations flight job controllers and supervisors will screen work requirements to
      decide if the work will be direct scheduled or planned work.
      13.32.2. Direct scheduled work, like fixing a leaky faucet, requires little detailed planning and normally requires less
      than 50 hours to complete. Planned work, like moving a doorway from one wall to another, requires detailed planning
      and may take several weeks or more to schedule craft workers and acquire materials.
      13.32.3. When work exceeds the scope or capability of the operations flight, the operations flight chief passes the
      request to the engineer flight for planning and programming and incorporating into the base civil engineer‘s facility
      project proposal list.
13.33. Planning and Programming Facility Projects:
      13.33.1. Planning refers to the identification of facility work to satisfy current and future mission requirements. The
      base civil engineer uses several methods to identify facility requirements including annual space utilization surveys,
      biennial commander‘s facility assessments, environmental compliance status assessments, asset management plans,
      and user- or occupant-identified requirements.
      13.33.2. During programming, the authority and resources necessary to accomplish the planned work are acquired.
      After the requirements are identified, the base civil engineer develops facility project proposals and presents them to
      the installation commander for validation, prioritization, and approval by the proper authority. A key element of
      programming facility requirements is proper work classification. Work authorization, approval levels, and fund
      sources vary with work classification. Real property maintenance work is classified as maintenance, repair, or
      construction. O&M appropriation-funded unspecified minor military construction projects may not exceed $750,000
      except for active component projects intended solely to correct a deficiency that is life, health, or safety threatening, in
      which case the cost may not exceed $1,500,000. Projects that are solely to correct a life-, health-, or safety-threatening
      deficiency that cost more than $750,000 must first be approved by the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force,
      Installations (SAF/IEI); they also require congressional notification.
13.34. Real Property Records:
      13.34.1. The base civil engineer will review and update real property records to ensure each facility or project is
      properly categorized. This includes updating real property records to reflect the proper category codes, user codes, and
      functional space allocation.
      13.34.2. Real property records form an audit trail that includes when a facility was built and the cost of any alterations
      and improvements accomplished by minor construction, to include self-help or government purchase card work.
      13.34.3. Facility managers must notify the base civil engineer, through the capital asset management section, of any
      changes to their facilities. Base leadership, MAJCOMs, Air Staff, DoD, and Congress use data from these records to
      make critical planning, programming, and budgeting decisions.

Section 13J—Energy Conservation Program
13.35. Air Force Need for Program.
      The Federal government, as the Nation‘s largest energy consumer, must significantly improve its energy management
      in order to save taxpayer dollars and reduce emissions that contribute to air pollution and global climate change. In
      encouraging effective energy management in the Federal government, the Energy Policy Act of 2005, EO 13423, the
      Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, and EO 13514, Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and
      Economic Performance, strive to achieve the following goals:
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                       307

      13.35.1. Energy Efficiency and Greenhouse Gases Reduction Goal.
            Improve energy efficiency through reduction of facility energy intensity (British thermal units [BTU] per year
            per square foot) by 3 percent annually through the end of FY15, or a total of 30 percent by the end of FY15,
            relative to Air Force energy use in FY03. Continue to reduce facility energy intensity by 1.5 percent annually
            from FY15 to FY20, or a total of 37.5 percent relative to Air Force energy use in FY03. Reduce greenhouse gas
            emissions in absolute terms by FY20, relative to a 2008 baseline.
      13.35.2. Sustainable Design and Development.
            13.35.2.1. All new construction and major renovation of facilities must comply with Air Force sustainable
            design and development policy, 2 June 2011, and incorporate sustainable practices. These facilities must
            become net-zero energy facilities (renewable generation offsets all fossil fuel) by 2030. Fifteen percent of
            existing facility inventory must incorporate sustainable practices by the end of FY15.
            13.35.2.2. Agency acquisition of goods and services must incorporate the use of sustainable environmental
            practices, including acquisition of biobased, environmentally preferable, energy efficient, water efficient, and
            recycled content products. This includes the use of paper with at least 30 percent recycled content.
      13.35.3. Vehicles.
            Petroleum consumption is to be reduced by 2 percent annually through the end of FY20 as compared to FY05.
            Alternative (nonpetroleum-based) fuel use is to be increased by 10 percent annually.
      13.35.4. Renewable Energy.
            The Energy Policy Act of 2005 established that in FY07 through FY09, 3 percent of electrical consumption be
            generated by renewable sources; in FY10 through FY12, 5 percent and 7.5 percent thereafter. EO 13423
            promotes, to the extent possible, renewable energy generation projects be on agency property for agency use.
            Title 10, USC, Section 2911, Energy Performance Goals and Master Plan for the Department of Defense, sets a
            goal of 25 percent of electrical energy consumption generated by renewable sources by FY25.
      13.35.5. Petroleum.
            Through life-cycle cost-effective measures, each agency shall reduce the use of petroleum within its facilities.
            Agencies may accomplish this reduction by switching to a less greenhouse gas-intensive, nonpetroleum energy
            source, such as synthetic or renewable energy sources.
      13.35.6. Electronic Products.
            Electronic products procured must be at least 95 percent compliant with electronic product environmental
            assessment tool standards. Energy Star features of computers must be enabled. Use environmentally sound
            practices when disposing of electronic equipment.
      13.35.7. Source Energy.
            The Federal government shall strive to reduce total energy use and associated greenhouse gas and other air
            emissions, as measured at the source.
      13.35.8. Water Conservation.
            Beginning in FY08, reduce potable water consumption intensity (gallons per square foot) relative to FY07,
            through life-cycle cost-effective measures by 2 percent annually through the end of FY20, or 26 percent by the
            end of 2020. Reduce industrial, landscaping, and agricultural water consumption by 2 percent annually or 20
            percent by the end of FY20 relative to a baseline of consumption in FY10.
13.36. Air Force Compliance with Policy.
      Compliance with energy management policy is assessed by taking measurements in two areas: mobility energy and
      facility (utility) energy. (Note: Water usage is included in the definition of energy management.)
      13.36.1. Mobility Energy.
            The policy to reduce mobility energy will be assessed by measuring actual petroleum consumption.
            Consumption will be measured in barrels and include aircraft and vehicle operations.
308                                                                                  1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
      13.36.2. Facility Energy.
            The policy to reduce facility energy will be assessed by measuring utility consumption to include electricity,
            coal, natural gas, petroleum, water, etc. Consumption will be measured in million BTUs per square foot (or
            gallons per square foot) and will include all installation facilities except privatized housing and facilities
            meeting Department of Energy exclusion requirements.
13.37. Conclusion:
      13.37.1. One of the primary roles of the NCO is that of manager. With the constant emphasis on efficiency, the Air
      Force must get the greatest return from every investment. The Air Force invests in people and other resources, all of
      which must be managed wisely. This chapter provided an overview of NCO responsibilities and outlined a few of the
      many Air Force management objectives.
      13.37.2. All supervisors, managers, and commanders are responsible for safeguarding Air Force resources and
      exercising sound resource management practices. Remember, the amount of money spent and the other resources used
      (manpower, facilities) affect the entire mission. SNCOs have a daily role to play in the overall system. They must plan
      for future requirements and ensure allocated resources are used properly. If correctly accomplished, the result will be a
      stronger and more efficient Air Force.

                                    COMMUNICATING IN TODAY’S AIR FORCE

Section 14A—Overview
14.1. Introduction:
      14.1.1. Communication is the process of sharing ideas, information, and messages with others; in the Air Force, most
      communication involves speaking and writing. Any communication can be broken into three parts: the sender, the
      message, and the audience. For communication to be successful, the audience must not only get the message, but the
      audience must interpret the message in the way the sender intended.
      14.1.2. This chapter begins by examining the fundamentals of better communication, both written and spoken. It then
      focuses on written communications in general terms and outlines certain methods that can be used to improve writing
      style. Finally, it provides an overview and samples of the types of correspondence the noncommissioned officer
      (NCO) is likely to deal with in daily activities.

Section 14B—Communication Basics
14.2. Principles of Effective Communication.
      Everyone must understand what makes communication succeed and what makes it fail. Most mistakes are caused by
      forgetting one of the five principles of good communication. This section addresses the five core principles, which
      have been organized to create the acronym FOCUS which stands for focused, organized, clear, understanding, and
      supported (Figure 14.1).
14.3. Focused.                                                                    Figure 14.1. FOCUS Principles.
      The first hallmark of good communication is that the                            Strong Writing and Speaking:
      communication is focused—the sender has a clear idea of the
      purpose and objective, locks on target, and stays on track.                                 Focused
                                                                                    Address the issue, the whole issue,
14.4. Organized.                                                                    and nothing but the issue.
      Good organization means your material is presented in a logical,                          Organized
      systematic manner. When writing or speaking is not well                       Systematically present your
      organized, audiences become easily confused or impatient and                  information and ideas.
      may stop reading or listening. Even if you are providing useful,
      relevant information, your audience may underestimate its value                              Clear
      and your own credibility.                                                     Communicate with clarity and make
                                                                                    each word count.
14.5. Clear.
                                                                                              Understanding
      This principle covers two interrelated ideas. First, to communicate           Understand your audience and its
      clearly, we need to understand the rules of language—how to spell             expectations.
      and pronounce words, and how to assemble and punctuate
      sentences. Second, we should get to the point, not hide our ideas in                      Supported
      a maze of words.                                                              Use logic and support to make your
                                                                                    point.
14.6. Understanding.
      When sharing ideas with others, it helps to understand their current knowledge, views, and level of interest in the
      topic. If you have been asked to write a report, it helps to understand the expected format and length of the response,
      the due date, the level of formality, and any staffing requirements.
14.7. Supported.
      Use logic and support to make your point. Support and logic are the tools used to build credibility and trust with your
      audience. Nothing cripples a clearly written, properly punctuated paper quicker than a fractured fact or a distorted
      argument.

Section 14C—Seven Steps for Effective Communication               Figure 14.2. Seven Steps for Effective Communication.
14.8. Overview.
       Like many things, good communication requires                          1.   Analyze Purpose and Audience
       preparation. There are seven steps that will help every                2.   Research Your Topic
       NCO become a better communicator, both in written                      3.   Support Your Ideas
       correspondence and in speaking abilities (Figure 14.2).                4.   Organize and Outline
       The first four steps lay the groundwork for the drafting               5.   Draft
       process.                                                               6.   Edit
                                                                              7.   Fight for Feedback
14.9. Step 1—Analyze Purpose and Audience.
      Once the need for communication is determined, step 1
      requires you to get clear on your purpose and audience. Those who have mastered the art of communication stay
      focused on their objective and approach audience analysis seriously.
      14.9.1. Choose the Purpose.
             Most Air Force writing or speaking is either to direct, inform, persuade, or inspire. Your task is to think about
             the message you want to send (the what) and make some sort of determination what your purpose is (the why).
             Once you decide the purpose, you will know where to place the emphasis and what the tone of your
             communication should be (Figure 14.3).
Figure 14.3. Determining Purpose.

 To Direct—Use the direct approach when you need to pass on information describing actions you expect to be carried
 out by your audience. The emphasis in directive communication is clear, concise directions and expectations of your
 audience.

 To Inform—Use this approach when you need to pass on information to the audience. The emphasis in informative
 communication is clear, direct communication with accurate and adequate information tailored to the education and skill
 levels of the audience. Audience feedback and interaction may be appropriate in some situations to make sure they ―got
 the message.‖

 To Persuade—This approach is used when you are trying to sell your audience on a new idea, new policy, new product,
 or a change in current operations.

 To Inspire—One final purpose for writing or speaking that doesn‘t get much attention but is frequently used in the
 military is to inspire. The emphasis in inspirational communication is delivery, a thorough knowledge of your topic and
 likewise your audience.


      14.9.2. Draft the Purpose Statement.
             One way to make sure you are clear on your objective is to write a purpose statement. This statement is one
             sentence that captures the essence of what you are trying to do—your ―bottom line.‖ Developing a clear purpose
             statement will:
             14.9.2.1. Help you FOCUS as you develop your communication.
             14.9.2.2. Help your audience FOCUS when you deliver your message.
      14.9.3. Know Yourself.
             Realizing your own strengths and weaknesses will help you meet your communication goals.
      14.9.4. Know Your Organization.
             In the military, we rarely act or speak in a vacuum. Often we represent our organization, unit, or functional area
             and must understand them and accommodate their views, capabilities, or concerns in our communications.
      14.9.5. Know Your Audience.
             The receiving audience falls into one of four subcategories. Depending on the type of communication and
             coordination necessary, you may or may not deal with each one of these:
             14.9.5.1. Primary receiver—the person you directly communicate with, either verbally or in writing.
AFPAM36-2241      1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                       311

           14.9.5.2. Secondary receiver—people you indirectly communicate with through the primary receivers.
           14.9.5.3. Key decisionmakers—the most powerful members of the audience; the ones that really make the
           decisions. Knowing who they are will help focus your attention and potentially your delivery in larger briefings
           and certain written communication.
           14.9.5.4. Gatekeepers—people in the chain who typically review the communication before it reaches the
           intended audience. Knowing who they are and what their expectations are can save you embarrassment and help
           ensure your success in the long run.
     14.9.6. Succeed With Your Audience.
           Some tips are:
           14.9.6.1. Rank. Differences in military rank can be a real barrier to communication in the Air Force. Many of
           us become tongue-tied when communicating with those senior in rank, and cursory or impatient with those who
           are junior in rank. We must constantly remind ourselves we are all communicative equals and should strive to
           be candid, direct, and respectful with everyone.
           14.9.6.2. Jargon. Tailor to your audience. Do not overestimate the knowledge and expertise of your readers, but
           do not talk down to them either. Be careful with excessive use of career-field specific jargon and acronyms.
           14.9.6.3. Be Inclusive. Remember our diverse force. Sometimes we inadvertently exclude members of our
           audience by falling into communication traps involving references to race, religion, ethnicity, or sex. Remember
           this concept when designing your visual support. Knowing your audience and adhering to good taste and
           sensitivity will keep you in check.
           14.9.6.4. Tone. This is not just what you say; it is how you say it. Closely tied to the purpose of your
           communication is the tone you take with your audience. Speakers have gestures, voice, and movements to help
           them communicate. Writers only have words on paper. How many times have you seen colleagues get bent out
           of shape over a misunderstood e-mail? Why? Because the nonverbal signals available during face-to-face
           communication are absent. Recognize this disadvantage in written communication and pay close attention to it.
           14.9.6.5. Courtesy. Be polite, please! The first rule of writing is to be polite. Forego anger, criticism, and
           sarcasm—strive to be reasonable and persuasive. Try not to deliberately embarrass someone if it can be avoided
           with a more tactful choice of words.
           14.9.6.6. Make it Personal. Remember, though, that it is not all about you! When appropriate, use pronouns to
           create instant rapport, show concern, and keep your reader involved. Using pronouns also keeps your writing
           from being monotonous, dry, and abstract. The pronouns you will probably use the most are you, yours, we, us,
           and our. Use I, me, and my sparingly. One rule of business writing is to put your audience first; so, when
           possible, avoid using I as the first word of an opening sentence and avoid starting two sentences in a row with
           we or I unless you are trying to hammer home a point.
           14.9.6.7. Be Positive. To cultivate a positive tone, give praise where praise is due; acknowledge acceptance
           before focusing on additional improvements; and express criticism in the form of helpful questions, suggestions,
           requests, recommendations, or clear directives rather than accusations. Your audience always appreciates
           sincerity and honesty.
14.10. Step 2—Research Your Topic.
     Whether your goal is to persuade or inform, you will need more than fancy words to win the day—you will need
     substance as well as style. Once you are clear on your purpose and audience (Step 1), you will need to research your
     topic to uncover information that will support your communication goals. Before you begin the research, refer to
     Figure 14.4 for the best approaches to researching.
312                                                                                     1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
Figure 14.4. Approaches to Researching.

                                                      Approach 1
 Review purpose and scope of the overall project. Sometimes your purpose and scope will evolve as you learn more
 about the topic, and you may need to do some preliminary research just to get smart enough to scope out the effort.
                                                      Approach 2
 Assign a deadline. It is easy to get lost in the research process. Don‘t do an outstanding job of data retrieval, then a
 marginal job on the presentation because you ran out of time.
                                                      Approach 3
 Ask the boss. Even if you can eventually find the answer on your own, save some time by asking your supervisor
 for suggestions on where to start.
                                                      Approach 4
 Determine what is known. Before you look for answers outside yourself, look in the mirror first. You may have
 valuable knowledge about an assigned research project, but you need to acknowledge and guard against your own
 biases in working a research problem.
                                                      Approach 5
 Determine where to look for information. Coworkers and base personnel are easy because you can meet with them
 face-to-face. Office files and references in paper form and on your computer network may be valuable sources of
 information. Finally, the Internet and library offer an unlimited supply of information.


14.11. Step 3—Support Your Ideas.
      Once you have researched your topic and collected information, you will need to figure out how to use what you have
      found to meet your communication goals. As you see, individual pieces of evidence are used to build your argument.
      When identifying some common types of evidence, include:
      14.11.1. Definition.
             A definition is a precise meaning or significance of a word or phrase.
      14.11.2. Testimony.
             A testimony uses the comments of recognized authorities to support your claim. These comments are sometimes
             direct quotations or paraphrases.
      14.11.3. Statistics.
             The use of statistics provides a summary of data that allows your audience to better interpret quantitative
             information. Statistics are usually very persuasive and provide excellent support if handled competently. Keep
             them simple and easy to read and understand. Also, remember to round off your statistics whenever possible
             and document the exact source of your statistics.
      14.11.4. Fact.
             A fact is the noncontroversial piece of data that is objectively verified. Be careful to distinguish facts from
             inferences, and handle inferences you would like to use in your research as testimony, not fact.
      14.11.5. Explanation:
             14.11.5.1. Analysis. The analysis is the separation of a whole into smaller pieces for further studies; clarifying a
             complex issue by examining one piece at a time.
             14.11.5.2. Comparison and Contrast. Use comparison to dramatize similarities between two objects or
             situations, and contrast to emphasize differences.
             14.11.5.3. Description. A description is to tell about something in detail, to paint a picture with words, typically
             more personal and subjective than a definition.
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                          313

14.12. Step 4—Organize and Outline.
      Select a pattern that enables you and your readers to move systematically and logically through your ideas from
      beginning to conclusion. Some of the most common organizational patterns are listed below. Your purpose, the needs
      of your audience, and the nature of your material will influence your choice of pattern.
      14.12.1. Topical.
            Use the topical format to present groups of ideas, objects, or events by categories.
      14.12.2. Compare or Contrast.
            Use the compare and contrast style when you need to discuss similarities and differences between topics,
            concepts, or ideas.
      14.12.3. Chronological.
            When using the chronological pattern, you discuss events, problems, or processes in the sequence of time in
            which occurrences take place or should take place (past to present or present to future).
      14.12.4. Sequential.
            A step-by-step approach, sequential is similar to the chronological pattern. Use this approach to describe a
            sequence of steps necessary to complete a technical procedure or process.
      14.12.5. Spatial or Geographical.
            When using spatial or geographical pattern, you will start at some point in space and proceed in sequence to
            other points. This pattern is based on a directional strategy—north to south, east to west, clockwise or
            counterclockwise, bottom to top, above and below.
      14.12.6. Problem and Solution.
            Use the problem and solution pattern to identify and describe a problem and one or more possible solutions, or
            an issue and possible techniques for resolving the issue. Discuss all facets of the problem, such as origin,
            characteristics, and impact.
      14.12.7. Reasoning and Logic.
            State an opinion and then make your case by providing support for your position. Use the reasoning and logic
            pattern when your mission is to present research that will lead your audience down the path to your point of
            view.
      14.12.8. Cause and Effect.
            Use the cause and effect pattern to show how one or more ideas, actions, or conditions lead to other ideas,
            actions, or conditions.
14.13. Step 5—Draft.
      A draft is not the finished product, and each sentence does not have to be polished and perfect. The focus is to get your
      ideas down on paper. Do not obsess about grammar, punctuation, spelling, and word choice—this all comes later. You
      do not have to fix every mistake you see. On the other hand, it can be helpful to keep an eye on your outline and
      periodically check the outline to keep from losing focus and writing paragraphs that do not support your purpose.
      Break up your draft into a three-part structure—introduction, body, and conclusion—and don‘t forget to write
      effectively.
      14.13.1. Introduction.
            The introduction captures your audience‘s attention, establishes rapport, and announces your purpose.
            Therefore, it sets the stage and tone for your message and the direction you plan to take the audience. A typical
            introduction has three components: stage-setting remarks, a purpose statement, and an overview.
            14.13.1.1. Stage-setting remarks set the tone, capture the audience‘s attentions, and encourage the audience to
            read further. Stage-setting remarks are also optional and can be omitted in very short messages.
            14.13.1.2. The purpose statement is the one sentence you would keep if you had only one. Moreover, the
            purpose statement specifically states your purpose, thesis, or main point.
314                                                                                  1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
            14.13.1.3. The overview clearly presents your main points, previews your paragraph sequence, and ties your
            main points to your purpose.
      14.13.2. Body.
            This is the heart of your message and includes the main ideas about your subject and supporting details under
            each main idea. The body will typically consist of several paragraphs, depending on the purpose and subject
            and, as a general rule, a separate paragraph for each main idea.
      14.13.3. Conclusion.
            The conclusion is the last and often neglected part of a well-arranged communication. An effective conclusion
            often summarizes the main points discussed in the body, and leaves the reader with a sense of closure. Conclude
            your communication with positive statements based on your preceding discussion and avoid bringing up new
            information. The introduction and conclusion should balance each other without being identical.
      14.13.4. Effective Paragraphs.
            14.13.4.1. Paragraphs are the primary vehicles for developing ideas. They serve to group related ideas into
            single units of thought, separate one unit of thought from another, and alert readers the writer is shifting to
            another phase of the subject.
            14.13.4.2. Each paragraph contains a topic sentence, preferably at the beginning, that prepares the reader for the
            rest of the paragraph and provides a point of focus for support details, facts, figures, and examples. Use
            supporting ideas to prove, clarify, illustrate, and develop your main point. The objective is to help the readers
            see the paragraphs as integrated units rather than a mere collection of sentences.
      14.13.5. Plain Language.
            Prepare all Air Force correspondence using plain language. Plain language means using logical organization;
            common, everyday words (except for necessary technical terms); ―you‖ and other pronouns; the active voice;
            and short sentences.
      14.13.6. Transitions.
            One way to make sure your paragraphs flow together, both internally and externally, is by using transitions in
            the form of words, phrases, or sentences. Internal transitions are used within a sentence to improve the flow,
            while external transitions are used to link separate paragraphs together within the body of the communication.
      14.13.7. Effective Sentences.
            To draft clear and concise sentences, choose clear and concise words and phrases to make up your sentences.
            There are three considerations to make when drafting sentences: active voice, smothered verbs, and parallelism.
            14.13.7.1. Write Actively. The active voice reaches out to the reader and gets to the point quickly with fewer
            words, whereas the passive voice shows the subject as receiver of the action.

                              EXAMPLES:


                              Instead of:        Your support is appreciated…
                                                 The IG team will be appointed…
                                                 It is requested that you submit…

                              Use:               I appreciate your support…
                                                 Colonel Jones will appoint the IG team…
                                                 Please submit…
AFPAM36-2241        1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                               315

            14.13.7.2. Smothered Verbs. Make your verbs do the work for you. Weak writing relies on general verbs that
            take extra words to complete their meaning. Keep verbs active, lively, specific, concise, and out in front, not
            hidden.

                            EXAMPLES:

                            Instead of:             The IG team held a meeting to give consideration to the printing issue.
                                                    Use that format for the preparation of your command history.
                                                    The settlement of travel claims involves the examination of orders.
                            Use:                    The IG team met to consider the printing issue.
                                                    Use that format to prepare your command history.
                                                    Settling travel claims involves examining orders.

            14.13.7.3. Parallel Construction. Use a consistent pattern when making a list. If your sentence contains a
            series of items separated by commas, keep the grammatical construction similar. Violations occur when writers
            mix things and actions, statements and questions, and active and passive instructions. The key is to be
            consistent.
                            EXAMPLES:

                            Needs Work:             The functions of a military staff are to advise the commander, transmit
                                                    instructions, and implementation of decisions.
                            Acceptable:             The functions of a military staff are to advise the commander, transmit
                                                    instructions, and implement decisions.
                            Needs Work:             The security force member told us to observe the speed limit and we
                                                    should dim our lights.
                            Acceptable:             The security force member told us to observe the speed limit and to dim
                                                    our lights.

      14.13.8. Writer’s Block.
            If you occasionally suffer from writer‘s block, you are not alone—many experienced writers have a hard time
            getting started. The five fears that lead to writer‘s block are fear of failure, fear of rejection, fear of success, fear
            of offending, and fear of running out of ideas. Figure 14.5 identifies some ways to overcome writer‘s block.
Figure 14.5. Ways to Overcome Writer’s Block.


      Brainstorm or ―free write‖ to get your creative ideas flowing.

      Write just the topic sentences for each paragraph.

      Avoid procrastination.

      Don‘t worry about page length, word count, or some other constraint on the first draft.

      Bounce ideas off a friend or coworker.

      Use visuals, like pictures or diagrams, to show meaning.

      Develop rituals or routines to get in the mood for writing.


14.14. Step 6—Edit the Draft.
      One way to make sure you edit efficiently is to read your document at least three times to allow yourself to really look
      hard at the problem areas that could mess up your product. In the first pass, look at the big picture; in the second pass,
      look at paragraph construction; and in the third pass, look at sentences, phrases, and words.
316                                                                                 1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
      14.14.1. First Pass: The Big Picture.
            Pay attention to the arrangement and flow of ideas. Here are some ideas to think about:
            14.14.1.1. Ensure the purpose statement answers the original tasker.
            14.14.1.2. Review the introduction to ensure it contains the purpose statement.
            14.14.1.3. Compare the introduction and conclusion to make sure they go together without sounding identical.
            The introduction should declare the purpose, and the conclusion should show the readers the purpose was
            accomplished.
            14.14.1.4. When checking for relevance and completeness, ensure the paragraphs clearly relate to the purpose
            statement, are relevant, contain all main points, and are arranged in a consistent order.
      14.14.2. Second Pass: Paragraph, Structure, and Clarity.
            In the second pass, check whether the main points and supporting ideas are appropriately organized in
            paragraphs. For each paragraph, focus on the following areas:
            14.14.2.1. Unity of Focus. Ensure there is only one main point of the paragraph and all the information in the
            paragraph relates enough to be in the same paragraph.
            14.14.2.2. Topic Sentence. Ensure the paragraph has one sentence that captures the central idea of the
            paragraph.
            14.14.2.3. Supporting Ideas. Ensure sentences expand, clarify, illustrate, and explain points mentioned or
            suggested in each main idea. The paragraph should have enough details to support the central idea without any
            extra sentences that are irrelevant to the main point. Also, ensure all transitional words, phrases, and clauses
            improve the flow and show proper relationships. Finally, the paragraph should contain three to seven sentences.
      14.14.3. Third Pass: Sentences, Phrases, and Words.
              Look at the details and concentrate on the small stuff that can sabotage your communication. These details
              include the passive voice, unclear language, excessive wordiness, grammatical errors, and spelling mistakes.
              Read the paper out loud. This increases the chance of catching errors because it requires the communicator to
              slow down and use two senses—seeing and hearing. What one sense misses, the other will pick up.
14.15. Step 7—Fight for Feedback.
      Fighting for feedback and getting approval are both activities that are part of life in the Air Force. Feedback and
      coordination are closely linked. If the communicator does a good job at fighting for feedback, the coordination process
      becomes much smoother. The biggest benefit to fighting for feedback is getting a second pair of eyes to review the
      communication. Even the best writers and speakers can become so close to the communication, they cannot see where
      it can be made stronger. Coworkers are usually a good choice because of their familiarity with the issue and jargon.
      Also, asking a trusted agent or someone you consider an expert in a specific area of the communication, such as
      grammar, is another choice to obtain feedback.
      14.15.1. Feedback.
            To give effective feedback, refer to the following:
            14.15.1.1. First, effective feedback is consistent, objective, and sensitive to the stated purpose. If asked to
            review a package, make sure you understand what the person wants from your review and stick to it.
            14.15.1.2. Second, distinguish between necessary, desirable, and unnecessary changes. A page full of red marks
            is hard to interpret. Instead, give the author a sense of what really needs to be changed.
            14.15.1.3. Third, avoid using general statements. Instead, pinpoint specific problems such as awkward
            sentences, grammar, etc.
            14.15.1.4. Fourth, concentrate on improving the message‘s content, not the style or personal preferences of the
            author (unless the author has asked you specifically to comment on writing style). Before providing feedback,
            refer to the feedback philosophies in Figure 14.6.
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                       317

Figure 14.6. Feedback Philosophies.

   Feedback:
        Should describe rather than judge.
        Is both positive and negative. A balanced description of other people‘s work considers both strong and
        weak points.
        Strive for being specific rather than general. Highlight or underline specific items you want to bring to the
        author‘s attention.
        Direct at behavior the author can control. A suggestion to improve the briefing room‘s temperature, for
        example, is probably beyond the author‘s control.


      14.15.2. Supervisor-Subordinate Feedback.
            Responsibility as a supervisor requires the need to be tactful and patient, especially when approving and
            disapproving subordinate‘s communications. A supervisor is obligated to help subordinates improve their work.
            This obligation may mean helping them to revise or rewrite their communication, especially if they are
            inexperienced.

Section 14D—Writing
14.16. Common Writing Formats.
      The principles of effective communication apply equally well to written and spoken communications. This section will
      not repeat these principles but will provide the basic formats of written Air Force communication. These formats are
      the most common and familiar ways of preparing all official and personal correspondence and memorandums.
      14.16.1. Official Memorandum.
            Official memorandums are used to communicate with all DoD agencies. In addition, use official memorandums
            to conduct official business outside the government with vendors or contractors when the personal letter is
            inappropriate (Figure 14.7).
            14.16.1.1. Use printed letterhead, computer-generated letterhead, or plain bond paper. Only type or print on one
            side of the paper using black or blue-black ink, and use 10- to 12-point fonts for text.
            14.16.1.2. Neatly and legibly correct minor typographical errors in ink on all correspondence—do not redo
            correspondence to correct a typographical error that does not change intent. Redo correspondence to correct a
            minor error only if the correction is sufficiently important to justify the time, purpose, and expense.
      14.16.2. Personal Letter.
            Use the personal letter when the communication needs a personal touch or when warmth or sincerity is
            essential. Furthermore, use this letter to write an individual on a private matter for praise, condolence,
            sponsorship, etc. Keep it brief, preferably no longer than one page. The personal letter should include a
            salutation element (Dear XXXX), and a complimentary close element (usually Sincerely).
      14.16.3. Memorandum for Record (MR).
            The MR is an informal document with a set format. Use the MR to record information that refers to a certain
            piece of correspondence or to note certain actions. The separate-page MR and the explanatory MR are two
            methods used most often.
            14.16.3.1. Separate-Page MR. The separate-page MR is an in-house document to record information that
            would otherwise not be recorded in writing (for example, a telephone call, results of a meeting, or information
            passed to other staff members on an informal basis). People who work together every day generally pass most
            information to their coworkers verbally, but there are times when information should be recorded and kept on
            file. An MR is the right tool for this purpose. A ―MEMO FOR‖ or a ―TO:‖ line can be added to specifically
            target the addressee. Figure 14.8 illustrates the format for the separate-page MR.
318                                                                                   1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241

        SUBJECT: Preparing a Separate-Page MR

        1. Use a separate-page MR to fulfill the functions discussed on the preceding page.

        2. Type or write the MR on a sheet of paper in this format. Use 1-inch margins all
        around and number the paragraphs if there is more than one. A full signature block
        is not necessary, but the MR should be signed.


                                                            CAROLYN R. BROWN
                                                            ASCS/DE




            14.16.3.2. Explanatory MR. The explanatory MR is usually on the file copy of most correspondence
            (Figures 14.9 and 14.10). This MR gives the reader a quick synopsis of the purpose of the
            correspondence, tells who got involved, and provides additional information not included in the basic
            correspondence. By reading both the basic correspondence and the MR, readers should understand
            enough about the subject to coordinate on or sign the correspondence without having to call or ask for
            more information. If the basic correspondence really does say it all, an explanatory MR may not be
            required. However, some organizations require you to acknowledge that you have not merely forgotten
            the MR by including ―MR: Self-explanatory‖ on the file copy.

    Omit the subject when typing the explanatory MR on the record copy. If space permits, type
    the MR and date two lines below the signature block. When there is not enough space, type ―MR
    ATTACHED‖ or ―MR ON REVERSE‖ and put the MR on a separate sheet or on the back of the
    record copy if it can be read clearly. Number the paragraphs when there are more than one. The
    signature block is not required; merely sign your last name after the last word of the MR.

Figure 14.10. Explanatory MR (Minimum Spacing).




      MR: When you have a very brief MR and not enough space on the bottom of your correspondence,
      use this tighter format. Sign your last name followed by the date.




14.17. Writing Accomplishment—Impact Bullet Statements.
        At some point in your career, you may be required to write bullet statements for an enlisted performance report (EPR);
        AF IMT 1206, Nomination for Award; bullet background paper (BBP); or other Air Force communication. The key to
        writing an effective bullet statement consists of three phases:
        14.17.1. Phase 1: Extract the Facts.
              Getting started can be the hardest part of bullet statement writing. The key is to collect all of the information
              you can find relevant to the actual accomplishment. First, gather as much information as you can, then sort
              through the information collected. When sorting the information:
              14.17.1.1. Isolate one specific action the person performed, but do not generalize.
              14.17.1.2. Try to select the proper power verb that best describes the action (for example, repaired, installed,
              designed, etc.).
              14.17.1.3. Look for as much numerical information as possible related to the action (for example, number of
              items fixed, dollars generated, man-hours saved, people served, etc.).
              14.17.1.4. Track down information to explain how the accomplishment impacted the bigger picture (for
              example, How did it help the work center? How did it support the unit‘s mission? How did it benefit the entire
              Air Force?).
              14.17.1.5. Once captured, review each item and test to see if the item is truly associated with the single
              accomplishment identified earlier.
        14.17.2. Phase 2: Build the Structure.
              Building the structure involves taking information from phase 1 and organizing the information into the proper
              structure of an accomplishment-impact bullet. There are two components: the accomplishment element and the
              impact element.
              14.17.2.1. Accomplishment Element. The accomplishment element should always begin with an action and
              only focus on one single accomplishment. Most of the time this action takes the form of a strong action verb
              such as conducted, established, or led. If you need to give action verbs an added boost, you can use an adverb
              such as actively, energetically, or swiftly to modify the verb. For a more complete list of verbs and adverbs,
              refer to AFH 33-337, The Tongue and Quill.
              14.17.2.2. Impact Element. The impact element part of the bullet statement explains how the person‘s actions
              have had a resultant effect on the organization. The impact element can show varying levels of influence, such
              as the person‘s actions connected to significant improvements to a work center‘s mission, a unit‘s mission, or as
              broad as the entire Air Force.
        14.17.3. Phase 3: Streamline the Final Product.
              Streamlining the final product is refining the bullet statement to make it accurate, brief, and specific.
              14.17.3.1. Accuracy. For anything to be accurate, it must be correct. Avoid exaggerating the facts.
              14.17.3.2. Brevity. When editing for brevity, use the shortest, clearest, yet most descriptive words to the reader
              and reduce unnecessary words.
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                          321

            14.17.3.3. Specificity. Convey the facts in detail; resist the urge to estimate or generalize. Instead, use exact
            numbers or dollar amounts.

Section 14E—Face-to-Face: Speaking and Listening
14.18. Air Force Speaking.
      This section focuses on spoken communication—both speaking and listening.
      14.18.1. Verbal Communication.
            An effective voice drives home ideas or information. The speaker has control over such things as rate, volume,
            pitch, and pause. The techniques used to create interest and help increase communication include:
            14.18.1.1. Rate. There is no correct rate of speed for every speech; however, consider this: people can listen
            four to five times faster than the normal spoken rate of 120 words a minute. Speak too slowly, and the audience
            will lose interest; on the other hand, speak too fast and the speech will become unintelligible. The key is to vary
            the rate of speech to hold the audience‘s attention and to add emphasis.
            14.18.1.2. Volume. Another verbal technique that can give emphasis to a speech is volume. If possible, check
            out the room to know how loudly you must talk, remembering you will need to talk louder with a crowd since
            the sound is absorbed. Remember your voice will carry further when the room is empty versus full. If the
            audience must strain to hear you, they will eventually tune you out from utter exhaustion. Speak louder or softer
            to emphasize a point—a softer level or lower volume is often the more effective way to achieve emphasis.
            14.18.1.3. Pitch. The use of notes, higher or lower, in the voice is called pitch. Speakers use pitch changes in
            vowels, words, or entire sentences. Use a downward (high to low) inflection in a sentence for an air of certainty,
            and an upward (low to high) inflection for an air of uncertainty. Variety in speech pitch helps to avoid
            monotone and to capture the listener‘s attention.
            14.18.1.4. Pause. The pause technique gives the speaker time to catch his or her breath and the audience time to
            collect the speaker‘s ideas. The pause technique serves the same function as punctuation in writing. Short
            pauses usually divide points within a sentence and longer pauses note the ends of sentences. The speaker can
            also use longer pauses for breaks from one main point to another, from the body to the conclusion of the speech,
            or to set off an important point worthy of short reflection.
            14.18.1.5. Articulation and Pronunciation. Articulation is the art of expressing                 words distinctly.
            Pronunciation is the ability to say words correctly. People can articulate their thoughts and   still mispronounce
            words while doing so. Unfortunately (and unfairly), many people consider word                    pronunciation or
            mispronunciation a direct reflection on the speaker‘s intelligence. If you are not sure of      the pronunciation,
            consult a current dictionary.
            14.18.1.6. Length. The length of a presentation is crucial. A key rule in verbal communication is to keep it
            short and sweet. Be prepared, know what you want to say, and then say it with your purpose and audience in
            mind.
      14.18.2. Nonverbal Communication.
            For many people, the hardest part of a talk is actually presenting it. How can body movement, voice, and
            sincerity enhance a presentation? Communications experts tell us that over half of our meaning may be
            communicated nonverbally. Although nonverbal meaning is communicated through vocal cues, much meaning
            is carried by the physical behaviors of eye contact, bodily movement, and gestures.
            14.18.2.1. Eye Contact. This is one of the most important factors in nonverbal communication. Nothing will
            enhance the delivery more than effective eye contact with the audience. Eye contact is important for three
            reasons. First, it lets the listeners know the speaker is interested in them. Second, effective eye contact allows
            you to receive nonverbal feedback from the audience. Third, effective eye contact enhances the credibility of
            the speaker.
            14.18.2.2. Body Movement. Good body movement is important because it catches the eye of the listener.
            Effective body movement can be described as free and purposeful. While not essential, the speaker should feel
            free to move around in front of the audience. When looking at note cards, speakers should drop their eyes, not
            their head.
322                                                                                   1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
             14.18.2.3. Gestures. Gestures are the purposeful use of the hands, arms, shoulders, and head to reinforce what
             is being said. Effective gestures are both natural and purposeful. Fidgeting with a paperclip, rearranging or
             shuffling papers, and constantly clicking a pen are distracting to the audience.
      14.18.3. Delivery Formats.
             Your approach to delivery of the spoken message is usually affected by several factors, including the time you
             have to prepare and the nature of the message. Three common delivery formats are:
             14.18.3.1. Impromptu. A delivery format where people respond during a meeting or take the floor at a
             conference is impromptu speaking. Speakers may do this when they have to speak publicly without warning or
             with only a few moments‘ notice. To do it well requires a great amount of self-confidence, mastery of the
             subject, and the ability to think on your feet. A superb impromptu speaker has achieved the highest level in
             verbal communications.
             14.18.3.2. Prepared (Formally Extemporaneous). Prepared speaking or briefing refers to those times when
             people have ample opportunity to prepare. This does not mean the person writes a script and memorizes it, but
             prepared delivery does require a thorough outline with careful planning and practicing. The specific words and
             phrases used at the time of delivery, however, are spontaneous and sound very natural.
             14.18.3.3. Manuscript. A manuscript briefing is the delivery format that requires every word spoken to be
             absolutely perfect. The disadvantage of a manuscript briefing is that people demonstrate a tendency to lack
             spontaneity, lack eye contact, and they stand behind the lectern with their script.
      14.18.4. Types of Speaking.
             Types of speaking used in the Air Force include briefing, teaching lecture, and formal speech.
             14.18.4.1. Briefing. The best military briefings are concise and factual. Their major purpose is to inform
             listeners about a mission, operation, or concept. Some briefings direct or enable listeners to perform a procedure
             or carry out instructions. Other briefings advocate, persuade, or support a certain solution and lead the audience
             to accept it. Every good briefing has the qualities of accuracy, brevity, and clarity. Accuracy and clarity
             characterize all good speaking, but brevity distinguishes the briefing from other types of speaking. A briefer
             must be brief and to the point and, at the same time, should anticipate some of the questions that may arise. If a
             briefer cannot answer a question, he or she should not attempt an off-the-top-of-the-head answer. Instead, he or
             she should admit to not knowing the answer and offer to provide it later.
             14.18.4.2. Teaching Lecture. The teaching lecture is the method of instruction most often used in the Air
             Force. As the name implies, the primary purpose of a teaching lecture is to teach students about a given subject.
             Teaching lectures are either formal or informal. Formal lectures are generally one-way with no verbal
             participation by the students. Informal lectures are usually presented to smaller audiences and allow for verbal
             interaction between the instructor and students.
             14.18.4.3. Formal Speech. A formal speech generally has one of three basic purposes: to inform, persuade, or
             entertain. The informative speech is a narration concerning a specific topic but does not involve a sustained
             effort to teach. Orientation talks and presentations at commander‘s call are examples of informative speeches.
             The persuasive speech is designed to move an audience to believe in or take action on the topic presented.
             Recruiting speeches to high school graduating classes and court-martial summations are speeches primarily
             developed to persuade. The entertaining speech gives enjoyment to the audience. The speaker often relies on
             humor and vivid language to entertain listeners. A speech to entertain is appropriate at a Dining-Out.
14.19. Effective Listening:
      14.19.1. Understanding the Listening Process.
             To better understand the listening process, let us begin by distinguishing between hearing and listening. Hearing
             occurs when your ears pick up sound waves being transmitted by a speaker or some other source. Hearing
             requires a source of sound and an ear capable of perceiving sound. Hearing does not require the conscious
             decoding of information.
      14.19.2. Listening To Make Sense.
             Listening, on the other hand, involves making sense out of what is being transmitted. Listening involves not
             only hearing, it involves attending to and considering what is heard. Effective listening is an active process, and
             active listening involves exerting energy and responding appropriately in order to hear, comprehend, evaluate,
             and remember the message.
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                              323

      14.19.3. The Importance of Listening.
            Listening is especially important in the Air Force, and actually in any military unit. Success is literally a matter
            of life and death, and we routinely maintain and operate equipment worth millions of dollars. Receiving,
            comprehending, and remembering spoken information is critical, and any miscommunication is potentially
            catastrophic. Effective listening helps to build the trust and mutual respect needed to do our jobs. Military
            personnel must understand their team members and the situation. Leaders with good listening skills often make
            better decisions and have a stronger bond with their Airmen.
      14.19.4. Pick the Right Tool for the Job: Informative, Critical, or Empathic Listening.
            There are different situations where listening is important and different reasons to listen. Everyone must
            understand the importance for acknowledging and identifying these differences because appropriate listening
            behaviors in one situation are sometimes inappropriate in another situation.
            14.19.4.1. Informative Listening. In informative listening, the listener‘s primary concern is to understand
            information exactly as transmitted. A successful listening outcome occurs when the listener understands the
            message exactly as the sender intended. Suggestions for improving informative listening are to:
            14.19.4.1.1. Keep an Open Mind. If the primary goal is to understand the message, set aside your
            preconceptions about the topic and just listen.
            14.19.4.1.2. Listen as if You Had to Teach It. Typically, we expend more effort to understand a subject when
            we know that we have to teach it to someone else. By taking this approach, we have the mental fortitude to
            focus longer, ask questions when we do not understand, and think more deeply on a topic.
            14.19.4.1.3. Take Notes. Focus on main points, and do not attempt to capture everything.
            14.19.4.1.4. Respond and Ask Appropriate Questions. Good informative listening questions help you clarify
            and confirm your understanding of the message.
            14.19.4.1.5. Exploit the Time Gap Between Thinking and Speaking Speeds. The average speaking rate is
            180 words per minute; the average processing rate is 500 words per minute. Use this extra time to mentally
            repeat, forecast, summarize, and paraphrase the speaker‘s remarks.
            14.19.4.2. Critical Listening. Critical listening is usually thought of as the sum of informative listening and
            critical thinking. The listener is actively analyzing and evaluating the message the speaker is sending. Critical
            listening is appropriate when seeking input to a decision, evaluating the quality of staff work or a subordinate‘s
            capabilities, or conducting research. Suggestions for improving critical listening are to:
            14.19.4.2.1. Take Notes. As with informative listening, focus on main points, and do not attempt to capture
            everything.
            14.19.4.2.2. Listen as if You Had to Grade It. One of the few things more difficult than teaching is grading
            another‘s work. By taking this approach, we have the mental fortitude to focus longer, ask questions when we
            do not understand, and think more deeply on a topic.
            14.19.4.2.3. Exploit the Time Gap Between Thinking and Speaking Speeds. Critical listening is different
            from informational listening in that you need to try to understand first and evaluate second. Even when you are
            listening critically, do not mentally argue with the speaker until the message is complete.
            14.19.4.2.4. Ask Appropriate Questions. Good critical listening questions will probe in nature to thoroughly
            evaluate the intellectual content of the speaker‘s message.
            14.19.4.3. Empathic Listening. Empathic listening is often useful when communication is emotional or when
            the relationship between speaker and listener is just as important as the message. Use this type of listening as a
            first step in the listening process, a prerequisite to informational or critical listening. Empathic listening is often
            appropriate during mentoring and nonpunitive counseling sessions and is very helpful when communicating
            with family members.

Section 14F—Electronic Communications and the Internet
14.20. E-mail.
      E-mail is defined as the electronic transmission of information over computer-based messaging systems. Recent
      technological advancements have increased opportunities for more timely, efficient, and effective text-based
324                                                                                  1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
      communications. These advancements facilitated the explosive growth of e-mail use throughout the Air Force at all
      levels. To uphold a commitment to secure messaging, the Air Force has established guidelines to ensure standardized
      and responsible use by all Air Force members.
14.21. Identity Management.
      A vital element for messaging security is the implementation of public key infrastructure (PKI) and common access
      cards (CAC) for identity management. PKI allows for the authentication of the sender identity using a digital signature
      and the encryption and decryption of the message. Users of DoD electronic messaging are directed to follow current
      Air Force guidance for the use of PKI to sign and encrypt e-mail.
14.22. Defense Message System (DMS).
      The DMS is the core messaging system of record for the DoD and the Air Force. DMS is a flexible, commercial-off-
      the-shelf based application that provides messaging services to all DoD users (including deployed tactical users) and
      interfaces to other U.S. government agencies, allied forces, and defense contractors.
14.23. Air Force Electronic Messaging Classes.
      Air Force messaging is divided into two classes: organizational DMS high grade service (HGS) and simple mail
      transfer protocol (SMTP) electronic mail (E-mail).
      14.23.1. Organizational E-mail.
             This class includes organizational messages that require a message release authority, are directive in nature,
             commit resources (that is, forces to military action), make formal requests, or provide a command position.
      14.23.2. SMTP E-mail.
             This class includes messages by an individual or organizational group/role that do not promise or direct an
             organization. Official SMTP messages will be digitally signed and encrypted. Unofficial SMTP messages
             require no digital signature or encryption.
14.24. Transmitting Official Taskings.
      Official taskings are sent to organizational addresses using HGS. Do not send official taskings to individual addresses.
      The sender must ensure the intended receiver receives the tasking. The receiver must ensure the tasking is accurate.
14.25. Individual Responsibilities.
      All government communications systems are subject to monitoring. Members of the Air Force or civilian employees
      may use a government-provided messaging system for official or authorized use only. Any other use is prohibited.
      Individuals must:
      14.25.1. Comply with the Air Force and major command e-mail policies.
      14.25.2. Maintain responsibility for the content of their e-mail messages and ensure that messages they send meet Air
      Force directives regarding acceptable use of e-mail.
      14.25.3. Maintain sent and received information according to Air Force records management directives.
      14.25.4. Include any special message handling instructions in the message body after the classification (first line) and
      before the actual text. Handling instructions for HGS are within the ―handling instructions‖ field in the automatic
      digital network (AUTODIN) tab of the HGS message.
      14.25.5. Obtain written approval from the commander before subscribing to, or participating in, electronic message
      newsgroups except official Air Force internal information products.
      14.25.6. Report any suspected violations of electronic messaging policy to their supervisor or the information
      protection office.
      14.25.7. Take appropriate action on nondelivery notices or message rejects to ensure messages reach the intended
      recipient.
      14.25.8. Protect sensitive and classified Air Force information.
      14.25.9. Not auto-forward e-mail from the ―.mil‖ domain to a local internet service provider.
      14.25.10. Not add slogans, quotes, special backgrounds, special stationeries, digital images, unusual fonts, etc.,
      routinely to their official or individual electronic messaging. They will not send harassing, intimidating, abusive, or
AFPAM36-2241        1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                           325

      offensive material to, or about, others. Individuals must consider the professional image and conservation of Air Force
      network resources (bandwidth).
      14.25.11. Follow the chain of command when e-mailing superiors. Do not send an e-mail directly to the ―Top‖ just
      because access to e-mail addresses is available. When sending e-mails through the chain of command, courtesy copy
      the individuals previously contacted.
14.26. Privacy Act Information.
      The Privacy Act of 1974 requires agencies to provide safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of records
      and to protect individuals against an invasion of personal privacy. Exercise caution before transmitting personal
      information over e-mail to ensure the message is adequately safeguarded. When information is so sensitive and
      personal, e-mail is not the proper way to transmit it. When sending personal information over e-mail within DoD,
      ensure:
      14.26.1. There is an official need.
      14.26.2. All addressees (including ―cc‖ addressees) are authorized to receive it under the Privacy Act.
      14.26.3. ―For Official Use Only (FOUO)‖ is added to the beginning of the subject line, followed by the subject, and
      apply the following statement at the beginning of the e-mail: ―This e-mail contains For Official Use Only (FOUO)
      information which must be protected under The Privacy Act and AFI 33-332.‖ Do not indiscriminately apply this
      statement to e-mails. Use it only in situations when you are actually transmitting personal information.
14.27. E-mail Protocol.
      E-mail protocol or ―netiquette‖ provides guidelines for proper behavior while on-line. There are many ways to make
      social blunders and offend people when you are posting. Respect the social culture, and remember that the net is
      multicultural. Nuances get lost in transmission.
      14.27.1. Rule 1—Be Clear and Concise:
            14.27.1.1. Make sure the subject line communicates your purpose. Be specific and avoid ambiguous titles.
            14.27.1.2. Lead with the most important information. If the goal is to answer a question, then paste the question
            at the top of the page for clearer understanding.
            14.27.1.3. Use topic sentences if the e-mail has multiple paragraphs.
            14.27.1.4. Be brief and stick to the point. Address the issue, the whole issue, and nothing but the issue.
            14.27.1.5. Use bold, italic, or color to emphasize key points.
            14.27.1.6. Choose readable fonts. Use 12 point or larger when possible.
      14.27.2. Rule 2—Watch Your Tone:
            14.27.2.1. Be polite. Treat others as you want to be treated. Think of the message as a personal conversation.
            14.27.2.2. Be careful with humor, irony, and sarcasm. Electronic postings are perceived much more harshly
            than they are intended, mainly because the receiver cannot see the sender‘s body language or hear the tone of
            voice, or any other nonverbals that make up 90 percent of interpersonal communications.
            14.27.2.3. DON‘T SHOUT. Do not write using all CAPITAL LETTERS—this is the e-mail equivalent of
            shouting and is considered rude.
            14.27.2.4. Keep it clean and professional. E-mail is easily forwarded. Harassing, intimidating, abusive, or
            offensive material is unacceptable.
      14.27.3. Rule 3—Be Selective About What Message You Send.
            Do not:
            14.27.3.1. Discuss controversial, sensitive, FOUO, classified, personal, Privacy Act, or unclassified information
            requiring special handling of documents.
            14.27.3.2. Forget operations security (OPSEC). Remember OPSEC, even unclassified information, when
            brought together with other information, can create problems in the wrong hands.
            14.27.3.3. Create junk mail, forward it, or put it on a bulletin board.
326                                                                                   1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
            14.27.3.4. Create or send chain letters. They waste time and tie up the system.
            14.27.3.5. Use e-mail for personal ads.
      14.27.4. Rule 4—Be Selective About Who Gets Your Message:
            14.27.4.1. Reply to specific addressees to give those not interested a break.
            14.27.4.2. Use ―reply all‖ sparingly.
            14.27.4.3. Get permission before using large mail groups.
            14.27.4.4. Double-check the address before mailing, especially when selecting from a global list where many
            people have similar last names.
      14.27.5. Rule 5—Check Your Attachments and Support Material:
            14.27.5.1. Ensure all information is provided the first time to keep from repeating e-mail just to add another
            fact.
            14.27.5.2. Before sending ensure that you have attached the attachments; this is the most common mistake.
            14.27.5.3. Cite all quotes, references, and sources. Respect copyright and license agreements.
      14.27.6. Rule 6—Keep Your E-mail Under Control:
            14.27.6.1. Sign off the computer when you leave your workstation.
            14.27.6.2. Create mailing lists to save time.
            14.27.6.3. Read and delete files daily. Create an organized directory on your hard drive to keep mailbox files at
            a minimum. Ensure record copies are properly identified and stored in an approved filing system.
            14.27.6.4. Acknowledge important or sensitive messages with a reply to sender; for example, Thanks, done, I
            will start working it immediately, etc.
            14.27.6.5. When away from your e-mail for an extended period, consider setting up an ―Auto Reply‖ message
            to let people know how long you will be unavailable via e-mail, as well as providing alternate points of contact
            for questions that require immediate answers or response.
14.28. The Internet.
      Use of the Web or Web technologies continues to increase as a technique for obtaining and disseminating information
      worldwide. The Web or Internet provides the capability to quickly and efficiently disseminate information to and
      access information from a variety of governmental and nongovernmental sources. The Air Force maintains and
      supports two types of Web pages or sites. The first is Air Force public Web pages or sites that are intended for viewing
      by the general public via the Internet; the information on these pages must be of interest to the general public. The
      second is Air Force private Web pages or sites intended for a limited audience, specifically .mil and .gov users. Users
      must consider the access and security controls required for information on private Web pages or sites.
      14.28.1. Use of Internet Resources by Government Employees.
            The Internet provides an indispensable source for information from a variety of governmental and
            nongovernmental sources. The Air Force goal, within acceptable risk levels, is to provide maximum
            accessibility to Internet resources for personnel requiring access for official business.
      14.28.2. Appropriate Use.
            Government-provided hardware and software are for official use and authorized purposes only. Appropriate
            officials may authorize personal uses; however, such policies should be explicit, as unofficial uses that exceed
            the authorized purposes may result in adverse administrative or disciplinary action.
      14.28.3. Inappropriate Use.
            Using the Internet for other than official or authorized purposes may result in adverse administrative or
            disciplinary action. The following are strictly prohibited:
            14.28.3.1. Using Federal government communications systems for unauthorized personal use.
            14.28.3.2. Sending chain letters and unofficial soliciting or selling that would adversely reflect on the DoD or
            the Air Force. Exception: Using authorized bulletin boards established for such use is allowed.
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                              327

            14.28.3.3. Unauthorized storing, processing, displaying, sending, or otherwise transmitting offensive or obscene
            language or material. Offensive material includes, but is not limited to, ―hate literature,‖ such as racist literature,
            materials, or symbols; sexually harassing materials, pornography, and other sexually explicit materials.
            14.28.3.4. Storing or processing classified information on any system not approved for classified processing.
            14.28.3.5. Using copyrighted material in violation of the rights of the owner of the copyrights. Consult with the
            servicing staff judge advocate for ―fair use‖ advice.
            14.28.3.6. Using the account or identity of another person or organization.
            14.28.3.7. Viewing, changing, damaging, deleting, or blocking access to another user‘s files or communications
            without appropriate authorization or permission.
            14.28.3.8. Attempting to circumvent or defeat security or auditing systems without prior authorization or
            permission (such as for legitimate system testing or security research).
            14.28.3.9. Obtaining, installing, copying, storing, or using software in violation of the appropriate vendor‘s
            license agreement.
            14.28.3.10. Permitting any unauthorized individual access to a government-owned or government-operated
            system.
            14.28.3.11. Modifying or altering the network operating system or system configuration without first obtaining
            written permission from the system administrator of that system.
            14.28.3.12. Copying and posting official FOUO, controlled unclassified information, critical information,
            and/or personally identifiable information on DoD-owned, -operated, or –controlled accessible sites or on
            commercial Internet-based capabilities.
            14.28.3.13. Downloading and installing freeware and shareware or any other software product without
            designated approval authority approval.
      14.28.4. Downloading Files from the Internet.
            To protect against computer viruses, all Air Force members must virus-check all downloaded files. This applies
            to sound and video files, as well as files attached to e-mail messages. If possible, download files to a CD/DVD
            and virus-check them before placing them on the computer‘s hard drive. If files are compressed, perform a
            second check of the decompressed files. To prevent the possibility of rapidly spreading a virus, do not
            download files to a network or shared drive. The Air Force allows the use of public domain or shareware
            software only after it is certified by a software testing facility.
      14.28.5. OPSEC and the Internet.
            The Internet access available to personnel at home and at work is an additional security factor. OPSEC training
            and education applies to computer use just as it does in conversations between personnel, transmitting
            correspondence, and telephone conversations. Policies restricting communication with unauthorized personnel
            also apply to Internet communications. Facebook and Twitter, as well as blogs and on-line discussion forums
            give personnel the opportunity to converse electronically to a worldwide audience. Military members and
            government employees will not discuss work-related issues in such open forums. Such discussions could result
            in unauthorized disclosure of military information to foreign individuals, governments, or intelligence agencies,
            or the disclosure of potential acquisition-sensitive information. For example, news media monitoring the
            Internet may construe an individual‘s ―chat‖ as an official statement or news release.

Section 14G—Conducting an Effective Interview
14.29. Introduction.
      Many Air Force positions for senior noncommissioned officers (SNCO) require a job interview. Knowing how to
      prepare for and conduct yourself during this process can go a long way toward helping you get that special duty or
      some other much-coveted job in the Air Force. This section is designed to help you prepare for and succeed in
      conducting an effective Air Force interview:
      14.29.1. Purpose of Interviews.
            So, you‘ve found a new job in the Air Force—one that requires special talents and experience; one that requires
            you to gather letters of recommendation, submit a resume, and provide copies of your last five enlisted
328                                                                                 1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
            performance reports (EPR); and one that requires you to sit through a job interview. If you‘ve ever completed a
            special duty assignment or worked at certain headquarters assignments, chances are you‘ve already sat through
            a job interview. However, for many SNCOs out there, the Air Force job interview is a new experience—one
            requiring preparation, practice, and perseverance.
            14.29.1.1. Before you set off for that interview, there are a few things you will need to understand about the
            interview process. First, you need to understand the purpose of the job interview. All job interviews are
            designed with one goal in mind: to find the right person for a particular job. As SNCOs, many of you will sit
            through job interviews to get that special job or position you‘ve been looking for. Understanding that employers
            may have to interview several SNCOs should give you some respect for the process and help you understand
            that your goal in an interview is to convince the interviewer that you are the right SNCO for the job.
            14.29.1.2. The second thing you should know about interviews is that they are a two-way process. You are not
            only interviewing for a job; you are interviewing the prospective employer to see if you actually want the job.
            Are you willing to spend the next 2-3 years of your career in this organization? Are you willing to work under
            the conditions laid out in the job description? Are you willing to make a permanent change of station (PCS) for
            the position? There are a host of other concerns you should have in mind when preparing for the interview,
            many of which should center on your desire for the job and working in the new organization.
            14.29.1.3. Third, you need to understand that interviews are information-sharing events between you and the
            interviewer. Your job is to convince the interviewer that your unique knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSA) are
            a perfect match for the position you‘re seeking. Conversely, the interviewer‘s job is to sift through reams of
            information gathered from numerous interviews and eventually match the right SNCO to the position. The
            interviewer is basically asking each interviewee the same question: ―Why should I hire you?‖ while all
            interviewees are also highlighting their particular skills for the job.
      14.29.2. Types of Interviews.
            As you‘ve just read, the purpose of the interview is to find the best SNCO for the job. However, interviews can
            be conducted in several different ways.
            14.29.2.1. Appearance Interviews:
            14.29.2.1.1. Appearance interviews usually take place in one of two formats: the individual interview or the
            panel interview. The individual interview may be the person who will supervise you or someone higher in the
            chain of command. Hiring decisions are often made based on this type of interview. Count on discussing your
            skills, experience, and training, and how they all relate to the job.
            14.29.2.1.2. A selection panel interview or board is frequently used when organizations are filling a managerial
            position. Usually, three or more people sit on the board, and all candidates are asked the same questions. A
            selection board interview usually involves more structured questions than an individual interview. The purpose
            of this interview can be stressful because you have to answer questions from several people. Be sure to make
            eye contact with everyone on the panel. When answering a question, it is especially important to make eye
            contact with the person asking the question.
            14.29.2.2. Phone Interviews:
            14.29.2.2.1. The phone interview is another strategy organizations use to select highly qualified SNCOs. In this
            situation, the hiring organization interviews applicants over the phone. These interviews are sometimes used to
            make first-round cuts to the applicant pool.
            14.29.2.2.2. If you apply for a special assignment, chances are it is to a location away from your current
            assignment. In this case, the hiring organization usually conducts the entire interview over the phone. In these
            situations, there is no second chance to make a good impression, and decisions are based strictly on the phone
            interview.
      14.29.3. Interviewing: A 3-Step Process:
            14.29.3.1. Pre-interview Preparations:
            14.29.3.1.1. One of the first things you need to do to prepare for any Air Force job interview is to carefully
            study the job advertisement or position description. This provides you with information on the particular KSAs
            for which the hiring organization is looking. What experience or skills are required for the job? Do you have the
            required experience or skills? Note the key responsibilities of the job and try to match your KSAs to those
            requirements. It is crucial you make the connections now because you will be asked to do the very same thing
AFPAM36-2241    1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                          329

         during the interview. This first step helps you understand how your talents measure up to the requirements for
         the position you‘re seeking.
         14.29.3.1.2. The next step is to gather all required information and documentation for the application process. In
         many cases, you will need to submit past EPRs, a personnel report on individual personnel (RIP), a resume,
         letters of recommendation, and a cover letter. A targeted resume and letters of recommendation should highlight
         your particular KSAs and relate them to the position for which you‘re applying. A cover letter should target one
         or two strengths not mentioned in your EPRs, resume, or letters of recommendation.
         14.29.3.1.3. It is important to conduct research on the mission and history of the hiring organization before the
         interview. Who are the commander and senior enlisted members of the organization? How large is the
         organization? What are the mission and vision statements? If you know someone who works in the
         organization, it is wise to call him or her and ask some particular questions about the organization. Are there
         any mission changes in the foreseeable future? How many enlisted personnel are assigned there? Has the
         organization done anything noteworthy in the past 2 or 3 years? The more you know about the organization, the
         better job you will do of convincing potential employers that you care about the organization, as well as the job
         you‘re seeking.
         14.29.3.1.4. When preparing for any interview, think about and write down your strengths and weaknesses.
         Identify two or three strengths that target the KSAs in the job advertisement. Next, identify one or two
         weaknesses that can be turned into strengths (for example, I‘m detail oriented but not a micromanager). Putting
         your strengths and weakness on paper allows you to study and become intimately familiar with them. It will
         also build your confidence as you prepare for the interview. As you write down your strengths and weaknesses,
         develop specific examples that highlight your skills. You will be asked to provide examples of your experience
         during the interview. Developing examples before the interview can only help make it flow more smoothly.
         14.29.3.1.5. Use job descriptions and bullets from past EPRs to develop possible questions employers might ask
         during the interview. Remember, employers know exactly what they are looking for, and they are using the
         interview process to find the right SNCO to fill the position. Put yourself in the interviewer‘s shoes and develop
         a set of questions you would ask if you were them. Then, develop answers to the questions you just came up
         with. If your EPRs were sent as part of the application package, you can bet some of the questions will be
         targeted toward specific achievements highlighted. Include specific, concrete examples that not only highlight
         your skills but also tie directly to the specific requirements of the job. Some examples of areas to concentrate on
         are: (1) problem-solving skills; (2) thoughts on Air Force transformation; (3) team-building skills; (4) how you
         support the Chief of Staff of the Air Force priorities; (5) leadership philosophy; (6) ability to adapt and work in
         fast-paced environments; (7) handling criticism; and (8) decisionmaking ability.
         14.29.3.1.6. Also, be able to answer the following questions: Why should I hire you? How soon can you report?
         If applicable, how does your family feel about the move? Where do you see yourself in 2 to 3 years? Are there
         any personal issues that may prevent you from accepting or performing in this position?
         14.29.3.1.7. Develop a list of questions to ask potential employers. Interviewers expect candidates to ask
         intelligent, thoughtful questions concerning the organization and the nature of the work. The nature and quality
         of your questions reveals your interest in the organization and the position you‘re seeking. Ensure your
         questions are employer-centered; avoid self-centered questions that might indicate you are primarily interested
         in knowing about the benefits of the position. Potential questions should center on (1) duties and responsibilities
         of the job; (2) possible mission changes in the organization; (3) chain of command or lines of responsibility; (4)
         unique requirements of the organization; and (5) a typical day in the organization.
         14.29.3.1.8. Finally, you need to practice, practice, practice. Practice how you will get out of your car. Practice
         how you will walk into the room. Practice how you will answer questions. Practice how you will ask questions.
         Practice your nonverbals. Practice anything you think you will do before, during, or after the interview. This
         will make you more comfortable and confident and will help you perform better during the interview. If
         possible, have friends and family conduct mock interviews. Practice in front of a mirror if mock interviews are
         impossible or impractical. The bottom line here is to practice, practice, practice!
         14.29.3.2. Listening Skills. Listening during the interview is as essential to your success as talking openly and
         honestly about KSAs. Concentrate on what is being said and how it is said, rather than how you are doing. By
         listening to the interviewer‘s statements, comments, and questions, you gain a better understanding of the
         organization and what it would be like to work there. If you pay close attention, you can probably hear the
         ―questions behind the questions‖ your interviewer asks. In other words, pay close attention and read between
         the lines for what is not being said in the interview, and you can probably pick up useful nuggets of information
330                                                                                  1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
            that can benefit you during the interview. For instance, if the interviewer continually asks about your ability to
            develop and motivate teams or seems to refer to getting teams to work better, you may pick up a possible team-
            development issue within the organization. With this information, you can sell your ability to lead and motivate
            teams and possibly land yourself the job.
      14.29.4. The Actual Interview.
            As mentioned earlier, most SNCOs will be interviewed in one of two ways: by phone or in person. If conducted
            by phone, the interview begins the moment you pick up the phone and ends once you hang up. On the other
            hand, personal interviews begin the moment you get out of your car and end when you drive out of the parking
            lot. Either way, the interview is the one best chance you have of ―selling yourself‖ to any potential employer.
            Whether you interview by phone or in person, there are certain rules you should keep in mind: (1) keep your
            answers concise, limited to about 2-3 minutes; (2) provide specific examples of your skills and achievements;
            (3) tie your strengths to the requirements of the job; (4) ask questions; (5) maintain a conversational tone
            throughout the interview; and (6) keep important documents nearby (such as EPRs, resumes, letters of
            reference, etc.).
            14.29.4.1. The Phone Interview. To some SNCOs, the phone interview may seem less important than a
            personal interview because the interview is conducted from different locations and removed from direct
            observation of the interviewer. However, in many aspects, the phone interview is more difficult than a personal
            interview. For instance, in a personal interview you can usually gauge how the interview is going by paying
            attention to the interviewer‘s nonverbals. On the other hand, with a phone interview there are no visual cues to
            tell you how you are doing. Therefore, there are some areas you will have to pay close attention to if you want
            to successfully navigate through a phone interview. Here are a few tips to help you succeed:
            14.29.4.1.1. Smile during the interview, just as you would in a personal interview. While hiding behind a phone
            allows you to disguise your body language, there is no way you can disguise your vocal nonverbals. Smiling
            during a phone interview keeps you energetic and helps project enthusiasm.
            14.29.4.1.2. Keep a mirror in front of you during the interview. This allows you to see your own expressions
            and will help to ensure you are smiling. It also helps you pay attention to your body language. Just because the
            interviewer can‘t see you doesn‘t mean he or she is not listening for details of your nonverbal responses during
            the interview. A mirror also ensures you conduct yourself in much the same way you would in a personal
            interview. You would not put your feet on a desk during a personal interview, would you? Of course not! So
            keep your feet off your desk during a phone interview. Believe it or not, your body posture naturally reflects in
            your voice. If your posture is slacking while you are on the phone, you can bet your vocal tone will convey that.
            Keeping a mirror in front of you will help you focus on your body language and nonverbal responses.
            14.29.4.1.3. Know when to speak, and then when to stop. In a personal interview, you can usually tell from the
            interviewer‘s nonverbals when you need to wrap up an answer or move on. Phone interviews are often filled
            with long, silent pauses. Do not feel that you need to fill that dead space with conversation. Pay close attention
            to the tone of the interviewer‘s voice and know when to shut up and move on.
            14.29.4.1.4. Develop notes for telephone interviews. These notes should include a list of your strengths and
            weaknesses and how your skills match organizational needs. Develop a list of potential questions employers
            might ask, along with possible responses. Practice delivering responses so that you will be ready to give
            polished answers in a clear confident tone. Do not memorize canned answers since they are likely to sound
            canned over the phone. Instead, use the script to trigger appropriate responses that sound both spontaneous and
            energetic. Do not forget to ask questions. Questions for potential employers should be part of your script and
            should be kept readily available during the interview. Keep in mind, the real key to success in any interview is
            practice.
            14.29.4.2. The Personal Interview:
            14.29.4.2.1. In many cases, personal interviews begin the moment you get out of your car and do not end until
            you drive away. Many prospective employers will observe you as you walk from your car to the front door of
            the building or office. Others will purposely let you sit in a waiting area for 10 to 20 minutes. All of this is
            designed to create tension and provide the employer an opportunity to observe your bearing before the actual
            interview begins. It cannot be overstated that you are on the interviewing clock even though you are not sitting
            in an interviewing room.
            14.29.4.2.2. In job interviews, potential employers judge you on how you look and act, not just on what you
            say. Your actions, mannerisms, and appearance are reflected in your body language. They give nonverbal
            information about your work-related skills, attitudes, and values. Research shows that 65 percent of meaning in
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                         331

            any interaction is conveyed nonverbally. In many interviews, nonverbal cues are just as important as verbal
            information in determining who is hired. After all, each SNCO the organization interviews is probably qualified
            for the job. Therefore, you want to appear more qualified than anyone else—do not let your nonverbals cost you
            a job.
            14.29.4.2.3. The first thing required for the interview is to ensure you are wearing the proper uniform. You
            should get this information before the interview, but check before the interview to make sure. Your dress and
            appearance is the first nonverbal message you send to any employer, so ensure you are squared away and
            nothing is out of place.
            14.29.4.2.4. Offer a firm (but not too firm), warm, whole-hand handshake. Shake hands with both men and
            women the same way. You would not give men and women different salutes, so do not offer them different
            handshakes. Practice your handshake before the interview.
            14.29.4.2.5. Make eye contact with the interviewers. Your eyes are your most powerful communication tools,
            and many interviewers use eye contact to determine enthusiasm, sincerity, and possible inconsistencies in your
            responses. If you use natural eye contact, the interview will become more like a conversation between
            acquaintances and you will get over some of your nervousness.
            14.29.4.2.6. Sit up straight, but not stiff, and lean slightly forward toward the interviewer. As the interview
            progresses, you may want to mirror the body language of the interviewer. If the interviewer takes a more
            relaxed posture, then you should relax too—but not too much. If the interviewer is more formal, then you need
            to mirror that formal behavior.
            14.29.4.2.7. Use natural gestures. If you normally use your hands to gesture as you talk, do so during the
            interview. Gestures help you relax, convey enthusiasm, and release nervous energy. Be careful, though, to avoid
            nervous gestures such as drumming your fingers, playing with a pencil, jingling the change in your pocket,
            tapping your feet, etc.
            14.29.4.2.8. Speak clearly and evenly—not too fast, but not too slow. Expression is a powerful way to show
            enthusiasm. Do not speak in a monotone voice. Allow your volume to rise and fall, and pronounce words
            clearly. Use good grammar and diction, and always think before you speak. The interviewer will assess your
            communication skills based on how clearly you express yourself.
            14.29.4.2.9. Notice the nonverbal cues of the interviewer. His or her facial expressions will let you know how
            well he or she is listening and may give you clues as to how you are doing. For instance, if the interviewer
            seems distracted or inattentive, you will need to shorten your answers, use examples, or ask questions.
            14.29.4.2.10. As the interview ends, take 2 to 3 minutes to summarize. This gives you a chance to end the
            interview on a positive note, convey your interest in the position, and sell yourself one more time. During the
            summary, recap one or two of the key points of the interview and restate how your experience and skills match
            those required for the position.
14.30. Post-interview Actions:
      14.30.1. Once the interview is complete, two things will increase your chances of success and help you learn from
      your experience. First, send a short (two or three paragraphs) thank-you note to the organization with which you
      interviewed. The letter should be typed or handwritten and should express your gratitude for the interview opportunity.
      Restate your interest in the position and highlight any particularly noteworthy points made in your conversation or
      anything you wish to further clarify. This is also an opportunity to add anything you forgot or wish you had said in the
      interview. Close the letter by mentioning that you will call in a few days to inquire about the employer‘s decision.
      Always mail the letter within a day or two of the interview.
      14.30.2. The second thing is to make a few notes about the interview. Record some of the questions asked and how
      you answered them. Write down your strong and weak points from the interview. Make a list of what made the
      interview successful, what you would change, and what you need to improve. These notes can be invaluable
      information for you to review and work on for future interviews.
14.31. Interview Conclusion.
      The job interview is the most important step in any job-search process. Many SNCOs will undergo the rigors of an
      interview for special positions during the course of their careers. Understanding the purpose of the job interview and
      your role in successfully planning for and conducting a proper interview can greatly increase your chances of landing a
      coveted job in the Air Force.

Section 14H—Staff-Level Communication
14.32. Spoken Communication Via the Meeting.
     Meetings are used to share information, solve problems, plan, brainstorm, or motivate. Whatever their purpose, it is
     good to know some basics about conducting an effective meeting.
     14.32.1. Planning the Meeting.
           Success or failure in a meeting can usually be traced to the planning phase. The key issues associated with
           planning a meeting are listed below. As you step through these items, remember to check on what are standard
           operating procedures in your organization. Meetings come in all flavors—from totally spontaneous to highly
           structured and ceremonial. Most are in the middle. If a group has been meeting regularly for a while, try to find
           out how they have done business in the past.
           14.32.1.1. Decide if the Meeting is Appropriate. If you can achieve the goal by speaking face-to-face with one
           or two people, scheduling a formal meeting might not be necessary. If the goal is to just pass on information,
           consider if sending an e-mail is a viable and appropriate substitute for the meeting.
           14.32.1.2. Define the Purpose. Every meeting should have a purpose. If it does not, you should not meet. When
           thinking about the purpose, define it in terms of the product wanted at the end of the meeting and what it will be
           used for.
           14.32.1.3. Decide Who Should Be Invited. Invite only those directly involved in the issues being discussed. If
           you are trying to solve a problem or make a decision on a controversial issue, make sure you have adequate
           representation from all groups who have a voice in the decision. If you only invite people with one point of
           view, your meeting will run smoothly, but your decision may not stand up later.
           14.32.1.4. Decide Where and When the Meeting Should Occur. Ensure the time is convenient for the people
           who are required to be there, keep it under an hour, or plan for breaks; finally, reserve the room.
           14.32.1.5. Plan for Capturing Meeting Information. If this is not a routine meeting with an appointed
           recorder, take a moment to think about how you will capture the meeting information, both in the meeting itself
           and afterwards.
           14.32.1.5.1. Capturing Information During the Meeting. Can this be done using standard note-taking
           procedures? (If so, make sure your conference room has a dry erase board, butcher paper, or other note-taking
           capabilities.)
           14.32.1.5.2. Capturing Information After the Meeting. Meeting minutes capture the process and outcome of
           the meeting. Minutes ―close the loop‖ on the meeting and let the attendees know what was decided.
           14.32.1.6. Send Out an Agenda. Create an agenda and send it to attendees no later than 1 or 2 days before the
           meeting. The agenda should include the date, time, location, and purpose of the meeting. This advance notice
           gives everyone an opportunity to prepare their thoughts and know where the meeting is going before they get
           there.
     14.32.2. Running the Meeting.
           Avoid dragging out a meeting unnecessarily.
           14.32.2.1. Start on Time. Meetings should start on time with an upbeat note, so do not wait for tardy attendees.
           State your desired outcome.
           14.32.2.2. Follow the Agenda. People hate nothing worse than a meeting that deviates from the agenda.
           Review the agenda in the opening minutes of the meeting to remind everyone of the goals and plan for the
           meeting.
           14.32.2.3. Understand Group Dynamics. If you are in charge of a group that will meet over a period of time, it
           pays to learn the basics about group dynamics. In all meetings, teams or groups move through predictable
           stages. To avoid frustration, becoming familiar with these stages is important.
           14.32.2.3.1. Forming Stage. When a team is forming, members cautiously explore the boundaries of acceptable
           group behavior. The forming stage is a stage of transition from individual to member status, and of testing the
           leader‘s guidance, both formally and informally. Because so much is going on to distract the members‘ attention
           in the beginning, the team accomplishes little, if anything, that concerns its project goals. Do not be overly
           concerned; this is perfectly normal!
334                                                                                1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
           14.32.2.3.2. Storming Stage. Probably the most difficult stage for the team is the storming stage. The team
           members begin to realize the task is different and more difficult than imagined and they become testy,
           accusatory, or overzealous. Impatient about the lack of progress, but still too inexperienced to know much about
           decisionmaking or the scientific approach, members argue about what actions the team should take. They try to
           rely solely on their personal and professional experience, resisting any need for collaborating with other team
           members. Their behavior means team members have little energy to spend on progressing toward the team‘s
           goal, but they are beginning to understand one another.
           14.32.2.3.3. Norming Stage. During the norming stage, members reconcile competing loyalties and
           responsibilities. They accept the team, team ground rules (or ―norms‖), their roles in the team, and the
           individuality of fellow members. Emotional conflict is reduced as previously competitive relationships become
           more cooperative. As team members begin to work out their differences, they now have more time and energy
           to spend on the project. Thus, they are able to at last start making significant strides.
           14.32.2.3.4. Performing Stage. By the time of the performing stage, the team has settled its relationships and
           expectations. At last, team members have discovered and accepted each other‘s strengths and weaknesses and
           learned what their roles are. The team is now an effective, cohesive unit. They can begin performing—
           diagnosing and solving problems, and choosing and implementing changes. You can tell when your team has
           reached the performing stage because you start getting a lot of work done—finally!
      14.32.3. Followup: Preparing Meeting Minutes.
           Followup involves sending out meeting minutes and starting the whole cycle over again. Prepare meeting
           minutes in the official memorandum format. Minutes are a clear summary of the participants‘ comments; they
           document planned or completed actions.
           14.32.3.1. Date the minutes the day they are distributed. The names of members present may be listed in two
           columns to save space.
           14.32.3.2. Place information regarding a future meeting in the last paragraph.
           14.32.3.3. When a person signs a paper as a member of a board or committee, the signature element indicates
           that person‘s status on that board or committee, not any other position the person may hold. To approve the
           minutes, type ―Approved as written‖ two lines below the recorder‘s signature block, followed by the approving
           authority‘s signature block.
           14.32.3.4. Minutes are typed either single- or double-spaced, with additional space between items of business
           and paragraphs.
           14.32.3.5. The format should be neat and orderly, paying particular attention to uniformity of margins and text.
           14.32.3.6. Spell names correctly, use acceptable grammar, and construct and punctuate sentences well. All
           verbs should be in past tense.
           14.32.3.7. The order of the minutes usually coincides with the order of the agenda and generally includes items
           such as:
           14.32.3.7.1. Kind of meeting (regular, special, etc.).
           14.32.3.7.2. Day, date, time, and place of meeting.
           14.32.3.7.3. The word ―Minutes‖ in the heading.
           14.32.3.7.4. Name of the meeting body.
           14.32.3.7.5. Opening paragraph; that is, The Executive Committee met for_____ meeting on day, date, and
           time.
           14.32.3.7.6. Members present and absent.
           14.32.3.7.7. Action taken on last meeting‘s minutes.
           14.32.3.7.8. Reports.
           14.32.3.7.9. Current business, with complete discussions and conclusions.
           14.32.3.7.10. Old business, with discussions, and follow up, as recommended.
           14.32.3.7.11. New business, with discussions and recommendations.
           14.32.3.7.12. Adjournment.

                                        THE BULLET BACKGROUND PAPER


         An increasingly popular version of the background paper is the ―bullet‖ background paper. The bullet
         format provides a concise, chronological evolution of a problem, a complete summary of an attached
         staff package, or main thrust of a paper.

         Main ideas follow the introductory paragraph and may be as long as several sentences or as short as one
         word (such as ―Advantages‖).

         -    Secondary items follow with a single dash and tertiary items follow with multiple indented dashes.
              Secondary and tertiary items can be as short as a word or as long as several sentences.

         -    Format varies.

              --   Center title (all capital letters); use 1-inch margins all around; single-space the text; double-
                   space between items—except double-space title and triple-space to text; and use appropriate
                   punctuation in paragraphs and complete thoughts.

              --   Headings such as SUBJECT, PROBLEM, BACKGROUND, DISCUSSION, CONCLUSION,
                   or RECOMMENDATION are optional.

         Keys to developing a good background:

         -    Write the paper according to the knowledge level of the user; that is, a person who is very
              knowledgeable on the subject won‘t require as much detail as one who knows very little.

         -    Emphasize main points.

         -    Attach additional support data; refer to it in the background.

         -    Require minimum length to achieve brevity with short transitions.

         -    End with concluding remarks or recommendations.

         Include an identification line (author‘s grade and name, organization, office symbol, telephone number,
         typist‘s initials, and date) on the first page 1 inch from the bottom of the page or at least 2 lines below
         the last line of text.

14.34. AF IMT 1768, Staff Summary Sheet (SSS).
      Use the SSS to summarize staff work, request action, or forward information. SSSs often contain several handwritten
      notes before reaching the approval authority; therefore, they do not require the same level of perfection (error-free
      typing, etc.) as the correspondence they may cover. Refer to AFH 33-337 for information on filling out the SSS.
14.35. Electronic Staff Summary (ESS).
      ESSs requiring your group or wing commander‘s signature should be sent through your internal channels via e-mail.
      The office of primary responsibility (OPR) transmits the package via e-mail to the first reviewer to coordinate and
      comment. The first reviewer should forward (never reply) the package with comments (if any) to the next reviewer.
      This procedure is repeated until the last reviewer has coordinated on the package. The last reviewer forwards the entire
      package back to the OPR.
14.36. Trip Report.
      A trip report describes a temporary duty trip to another location and includes the purpose, travelers, itinerary,
      discussions, and conclusions or recommendations. Note: Most organizations have a standard trip report template.
14.37. Staff Study Report.
      Use the staff study report to analyze a clearly defined problem, identify conclusions, and make recommendations. Not
      all organizations routinely use a staff study report, but it is an accepted format for a problem-solution report in both
      Air Force and Joint Staffs. The staff study report should represent completed staff work. This means the staff member
      has solved a problem and presented a complete solution to the boss. The solution should be complete enough that the
      decisionmaker has only to approve or disapprove.
14.38. Conclusion.
      Clear, concise, well-thought-out, and well-composed communication is essential for meeting the needs of today‘s Air
      Force. We are all involved in speaking and writing to some extent. Therefore, we must become proficient at the
      methods we use. The meeting is an important forum for providing information, solving problems, and answering
      questions. Written communication is also another area crucial to meeting the Air Force mission. Fortunately, we have
      several instruments at our disposal to help us with the process. The SSS, BBP, trip report, and staff study report all
      serve a useful purpose and are tools that help facilitate staff-level communication.

                                               PERSONNEL PROGRAMS
Section 15A—Overview
15.1. Introduction.
      The Air Force mission requires military members to be prepared for service at all times. Mission support organizations
      ensure Airmen's families are cared for; pay and entitlements are properly addressed; and individual rights are secured.
      This chapter includes information on manpower management, enlisted assignments, family care, reenlistment and
      retraining opportunities, benefits and services, personnel records, individual rights, the awards and decorations
      program, and the enlisted promotion system.

Section 15B—Manpower Management
15.2. Manpower Resources.
      All budgeted and programmed manpower resources for the total Air Force (Regular Air Force, Air Force Reserve
      [AFR], and Air National Guard [ANG]) derive from two sources: the Department of Defense (DoD) Future Years
      Defense Program and the Air Force‘s Force and Financial Plan. DoD uses elements of the future years defense
      program to budget for and control its resources. The Air Force uses the force and financial plan to budget for and
      control its portion of the DoD overall resources.
15.3. Chain of Responsibilities.
      From the future years defense program and force and financial plan, the Headquarters United States Air Force
      Directorate of Manpower and Organization (HQ USAF/A1M) allocates programmed manpower resources to the major
      commands (MAJCOM) directing implementation of approved programs. MAJCOMs translate manpower resources
      into manpower authorizations by updating the Manpower Programming Execution System by organization, Air Force
      specialty code (AFSC), grade, etc. The installation Manpower and Organization Section is the manpower and
      organization issue liaison between installation agencies and the MAJCOM A1M staff.
15.4. Manpower Resource Levels:
      15.4.1. Changing Manpower Allocations.
             Command-specific military and civilian manpower requirements must be certified by the MAJCOM A1M and
             approved by HQ USAF/A1M before they can be used in the programming and resourcing process. Before
             manpower allocations can be changed, the requesting organization must give reasons for the requested change.
             The MAJCOM must propose specific tradeoffs if the initiative requires an increase in military or civilian
             manpower.
      15.4.2. Accommodating Temporary Manpower Requirements.
             Air Force manpower is not changed to accommodate cyclical or temporary requirements. Instead, the Air Force
             authorizes civilian overtime, temporary full- and part-time civilian positions, temporary duty (TDY) of military
             or civilian personnel, and the use of contract services to perform this workload.
      15.4.3. Determining Manpower Requirements.
             The Air Force manpower requirements determination process systematically identifies minimum-essential
             manpower required for the most effective and economical accomplishment of approved missions and functions
             within organizational and resource constraints. To accomplish this, HQ USAF functional managers work with
             HQ USAF/A1M to determine the appropriate manpower management tool consistent with resources needed to
             develop the manpower standard; the required mix of military, civilian, or contract services; and the required
             military category (officer or enlisted) and grade. The servicing civilian personnel flight works with the Air
             Force Personnel Center (AFPC), Directorate of Civilian Personnel Operations (HQ AFPC/DPC), to determine
             civilian grades based on job content in position descriptions.
15.5. Requirements Determination:
      15.5.1. General Concept.
             Manpower and organization section personnel assist Air Force commanders and functional managers at all
             levels in mission accomplishment by objectively quantifying manpower requirements for the distribution of Air
             Force manpower resources. Key services of this competency include peacetime manpower standards
             development, wartime manpower requirements, and commercial services management actions (for example,
338                                                                                1 OCTOBER 2013        AFPAM36-2241
            public-private competition, in-sourcing, and business process reengineering). Integral in any manpower
            requirements, determination effort is a review of a function‘s processes with the goal of making process
            improvements.
      15.5.2. Most Efficient Organization.
            15.5.2.1. Manpower standards are established to ensure work center operations are efficient and standardized;
            i.e., to create the most efficient organization. The ultimate goal of organizational performance is mission
            accomplishment. Resource requirements reflected in a manpower standard should be based on an organization
            and process design, which most effectively and efficiently accomplishes the mission. Improving mission
            effectiveness while maintaining or improving efficiency should be the goal of any modification to a function‘s
            current organizational or process design. Efficiency does not necessarily mean decreasing resources but rather
            improving the return on the resources used.
            15.5.2.2. A most efficient organization is also a term used to describe the work center developed by functional
            experts as part of a public-private competition under Office of Management and Budget‘s Circular (OMBC) A-
            76, Performance of Commercial Activities. The process emphasizes innovation in meeting the requirements laid
            out in the solicitation for the work being competed. The most efficient organization is allowed latitude in its
            organization and processes outside of the standard Air Force structure to enable greater efficiency and
            effectiveness. The most efficient organization is submitted as part of the agency tender, which is the
            government‘s proposal for how it will perform the work. Ultimately this organization competes with the private
            sector bid in a cost comparison under A-76 rules.
      15.5.3. Performance Improvement.
            Improving performance requires both planning and execution. For organizational change efforts to be effective,
            they generally must include some redesign and/or coordination on five fronts. These fronts are related
            organizational areas that should be considered. A change on one front may require actions or changes on
            another. For example, changing a process may also require some training or retraining (people front); the
            process improvement may affect how technology is used (technology front); or the process design may require
            updates to regulations (policy, legislation, regulation front). The five fronts are:
            15.5.3.1. Organization and People. Human resources are the key to future viability and organizational growth
            in a continuously learning environment. Although processes and other front factors may change, focus should
            remain on providing workers with appropriate knowledge, skills, experiences, and tools. This will empower
            them to learn and act, which will tie their rewards to the organization‘s values and measures.
            15.5.3.2. Technology. Technology is a crucial enabling factor that allows compression of cycles, lead time,
            distance, and broader access to information and knowledge assets. Technology also eliminates barriers between
            customers and suppliers.
            15.5.3.3. Policies, Legislation, and Regulations. Changing existing policies, regulations, and legislation may
            be required for new processes.
            15.5.3.4. Physical Infrastructure. The physical facilities, equipment, and tools should be designed to support
            and maximize changes in workflow, information technology, and human resources.
            15.5.3.5. Process. The flow of work and information into, through, and out of the organization must be
            redesigned, overcoming the constraints of traditional functions or boundaries.
15.6. Unit Manpower Document (UMD).
      The UMD, used to help manage manpower resources, is a computer product that lists unit funded and unfunded
      manpower requirements. It contains many data elements that identify the unique position attributes. These attributes
      include position number, AFSC, functional account code, work center, grade, number of authorizations, personnel
      accounting symbol data, and reason code to reflect the workforce mix decision for an activity. The UMD is the
      primary document that reflects the manpower required to accomplish the unit mission. The installation manpower and
      organization office will periodically, or upon request, supply a unit with an updated UMD. Supervisors should
      routinely check the UMD for accuracy and use it to track their authorized manpower strength. AF/A1M and the Air
      Force Manpower Agency (AFMA) often produce reports based on UMD data; continuous review of coding is critical
      for proper position management.
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                        339

Section 15C—Enlisted Assignments
15.7. General Information.
      Qualified Airmen must be in the right jobs at the right time to accomplish the Air Force mission. At the same time, the
      Air Force must remain attuned to the demands placed on Airmen resulting from personnel tempo (PERSTEMPO).
      PERSTEMPO is a quality-of-life measurement that measures how much time during a 12-month period an Airman
      spends away from his or her home station for operational and training purposes. Consequently, the Air Force classifies
      and assigns Airmen worldwide as equitably as possible to ensure a high state of readiness. The Air Force also
      recognizes a need for special assignment considerations to take care of Air Force Airmen with exceptional needs. The
      Air Force uses a coherent and logical classification system to identify valid manpower requirements, to identify and
      describe each Air Force occupational specialty, to ensure minimum prerequisite standards are set for each specialty,
      and to ensure qualified Airmen are placed into each specialty. While the primary consideration in selecting Airmen for
      reassignment is the Airmen‘s qualifications to accomplish the mission, the Air Force also considers additional factors:
      15.7.1. To the maximum extent possible, the Air Force assigns Airmen on a voluntary basis and in the most equitable
      manner feasible.
      15.7.2. The Air Force equitably distributes involuntary assignments among similarly qualified Airmen to minimize
      family separation and to avoid creating a severe personal hardship on Airmen.
      15.7.3. Limitations may be established on involuntary selection for permanent changes of station (PCS) following
      some TDYs to allow Airmen to attend essential military and personal pre-PCS requirements, as well as to reduce
      Airmen and family turbulence.
15.8. Assignment Authority.
      The DoD allocates funds, delegates authority, and directs policies for the PCS assignment of Airmen to satisfy
      national security requirements. PCS assignments may also be directed to ensure equitable treatment of Airmen, such as
      PCS from overseas (OS) to the continental United States (CONUS) upon completion of the prescribed OS tour. Air
      Force Instruction (AFI) 36-2110, Assignments, is the governing instruction for operational (including rotational)
      training (including formal education and professional military education [PME]) and force structure assignments.
      15.8.1. Assignment Requests.
            The director of assignments (or equivalent) in coordination with MAJCOMs, field operating agencies (FOA),
            and direct reporting units (DRU) is authorized to initiate assignments for Airmen currently assigned to
            MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU to fill valid vacant manpower authorizations. AFPC is the final approval authority for
            Airman assignments. The Airman Assignment Division (AFPC/DPAA) is the final approval authority for
            Airman assignments in the grades of senior master sergeant (SMSgt) and below. The Chiefs Group (AF/DPE) is
            the final approval authority for chief master sergeant (CMSgt) and CMSgt-select assignments.
      15.8.2. Distribution of Personnel.
            Airmen are distributed to meet the overall needs of the Air Force according to law and DoD and Air Force
            directives and instructions; as equitably as possible between MAJCOMs, within a specialty and grade;
            according to guidance from the Air Staff functional area office of primary responsibility (OPR); and as directed
            by the designated assignment authority outlined in AFI 36-2110.
15.9. Assignment Policy and Procedures:
      15.9.1. Equal Opportunity.
            The Air Force assigns Airmen without regard to color, race, religious preference (except chaplains), national
            origin, ethnic background, age, marital status (except military couples), spouse‘s employment, education or
            volunteer service activities of spouse, or gender (except as provided for by statute or other policies). This
            applies to both PCS and TDY assignments. The primary factor in selecting Airmen for PCS is the Airmen‘s
            qualifications to fill a valid manpower requirement and perform productively in the position for which being
            considered. When Airmen with the required qualifications are identified, then PCS eligibility criteria and other
            factors are considered.
      15.9.2. Special Experience Identifier (SEI).
            The SEI system complements the assignment process and is used in conjunction with grade, AFSC, AFSC
            prefixes and suffixes, etc., to match uniquely qualified Airmen to jobs with special requirements. SEIs may be
            used when specific experience or training is critical to the job, and no other means is appropriate or available.
340                                                                                  1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
            The SEI system is also used to rapidly identify Airmen to meet unique circumstances, contingency
            requirements, or other critical needs. Manpower positions are coded with an SEI to identify positions that
            require or provide unique experiences or qualifications. The personnel records for the Airmen who earn an SEI
            are similarly coded.
      15.9.3. Security Access Requirement.
            Manpower positions often require Airmen assigned to have access to a specified level of classified information.
            However, sometimes the urgency to fill a position does not allow selection of Airmen using PCS eligibility
            criteria and subsequent processing (and/or investigation) for access at the specified level. Under these
            circumstances, selection may be necessary from among Airmen who currently have access or can be granted
            access immediately.
      15.9.4. Grade, AFSC, and Skill-Level Relationship for Assignment.
            CMSgts and CMSgt-selects may be assigned in any AFSC or chief enlisted manager (CEM) code they possess
            or are qualified to be awarded. Normally, Airmen in the grade of SMSgt and below are selected for assignment
            in their control Air Force specialty code (CAFSC). Airmen with an incompatible grade and CAFSC skill level
            because of retraining or reclassification are selected for assignment and allocated against requirements
            commensurate with their grade, regardless of their CAFSC skill level. Normally, Airmen are selected based on
            their grade and skill level. CMSgts fill CEM code positions; SMSgts fill 9-skill level positions; master sergeants
            (MSgt) and technical sergeants (TSgt) fill 7-skill level positions; staff sergeants (SSgt) and Senior Airmen
            (SrA) fill 5-skill level positions; and Airmen first class (A1C), Airmen (Amn), and Airmen basic (AB) fill 3-
            skill level positions.
      15.9.5. Volunteer Status and PCS Eligibility.
            Within a group of qualified Airmen who meet the minimum eligibility criteria for PCS selection, volunteers are
            selected ahead of nonvolunteers. Furthermore, nonvolunteers qualified to fill a requirement who meet the
            minimum PCS eligibility criteria are selected ahead of qualified volunteers who do not meet PCS eligibility
            criteria. For example, time on station (TOS) is a PCS eligibility requirement. A qualified volunteer who meets
            the minimum TOS requirement is considered first in order of longest on station. Next, the qualified
            nonvolunteer who meets the TOS requirement in the order of longest on station, and finally the qualified
            volunteer who does not meet the TOS requirement may be considered; however, it will require a TOS waiver.
      15.9.6. CMSgt Development.
            AF/DPE uses the CMSgt assignment policies to support the continued development of CMSgts. Because
            CMSgts are Air Force senior leaders, these policies are comparable with other senior leader assignment and
            development methods. Policies include:
            15.9.6.1. Three-year Limits for Headquarters Staff and Special Duty Tours. CMSgts serving in MAJCOM,
            HQ Air Force, and Joint staff positions, as well as special duty positions will be limited to serving 3-year tours.
            This increases the opportunities for CMSgts to serve in these positions, enhancing their development.
            Additionally, this improves the flow of field experience into headquarters staff positions and staff experience
            into base-level units.
            15.9.6.2. Date Eligible for Return from Overseas (DEROS) Management. DEROS adjustment requests, like
            DEROS extensions, indefinite DEROSs, and in-place consecutive OS tours, are closely scrutinized for CMSgts
            and only considered if in the best interest of the Air Force and supportive of CMSgt development.
            Subsequently, DEROS adjustments are not routinely approved for CMSgts.
            15.9.6.3. Home-Basing Requests. In addition to closely scrutinizing DEROS adjustment requests, the Chiefs
            Group also uses the same criteria to review home-basing requests, which are also not routinely approved. The
            same rationale used in paragraph 15.9.6.2 applies.
            15.9.6.4. Nominative Selection for Strategic-Level Assignments. Specific strategic-level assignments such as
            Air Force career field managers (AFCFM) and Command Chief Master Sergeants (CCM) are filled using a
            nominative selection process. The hiring authority for these positions requests nominations from appropriate
            organizations, frequently each MAJCOM. Each organization then identifies their most qualified CMSgts for the
            advertised position and nominates them to the hiring authority. The hiring authority then selects the best Airman
            for the job. This highly competitive process ensures a significant level of visibility and senior leader
            involvement in selecting CMSgts to serve in these top positions.
AFPAM36-2241     1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                             341

          15.9.6.5. CCM Assignments. CCM assignments are 2-year minimum/3-year maximum tours. This ensures an
          appropriate balance between fresh enlisted leadership and leadership stability within organizations.
    15.9.7. First-Term Airmen (FTA).
          FTA serving an initial enlistment of 4 or more years may not be given more than two assignments in different
          locations following initial basic and skill training during their first 4 years of service, regardless of tour length.
          FTA who make two PCS moves are permitted an additional PCS in conjunction with an approved humanitarian
          reassignment or a join-spouse assignment, as a volunteer, or when the PCS is a mandatory move. Low-cost
          moves are excluded from the two-move count.
    15.9.8. Availability and Deferment.
          Airmen are considered available for reassignment on the first day of the ―availability‖ month. Deferments may
          be authorized, when possible in most grades and AFSCs, to maintain an equitable assignment system and also
          support the need for stability in certain organizations or functions. The reasons for deferments vary. Deferments
          are normally approved to preclude an Airman‘s PCS while suitability to remain on active duty is evaluated or
          during a period of observation or rehabilitation. Deferments also exist for such things as completion of an
          educational program or degree, witness for a court-martial, accused in a court-martial, control roster, Article 15
          punishment, base of preference (BOP) program, retraining, humanitarian reasons, etc. AFI 36-2110 contains a
          complete list of deferments.
          15.9.8.1. Humanitarian and Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) Reassignment or Deferment.
          Policies and procedures concerning humanitarian and EFMP reassignment or deferment are outlined in AFI 36-
          2110. These policies and procedures include but are not limited to:
          15.9.8.1.1. The humanitarian policy provides reassignment or deferment for Airmen to help them resolve severe
          short-term problems involving a family member. The problem must be resolvable within a reasonable period of
          time (normally 12 months); the Airman‘s presence must be considered absolutely essential to resolve the
          problem; and the Airman must be effectively utilized in his or her CAFSC at the new assignment. Family
          members under the humanitarian program are limited to spouse, children, parents, parents-in-law, and those
          people who have served ―in loco parentis.‖ A person ―in loco parentis‖ refers to one who has exercised parental
          rights and responsibilities in place of a natural parent for at least 5 years before the Airman‘s or spouse‘s 21st
          birthday, or before the Airman‘s entry to the Regular Air Force, whichever is earlier. While brothers and sisters
          are not included in the definition of family member for humanitarian consideration, a request involving a
          brother‘s or sister‘s terminal illness will be considered as an exception to policy.
          15.9.8.1.2. The Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) is a separate and distinct program from
          humanitarian policy. The EFMP is based on an Airman‘s need for special medical or educational care for a
          spouse or child that is required long term, possibly permanently. Therefore, this program is not a base-of-choice
          program as assignment decisions are based on manning needs of the Air Force at locations where the special
          medical or educational needs for a spouse or child can be met. The Air Force‘s commitment and responsibilities
          under the EFMP require mandatory enrollment and identification of exceptional family members. Under the
          EFMP, an Airman may receive a reassignment if a need arises for specialized care that cannot be met where
          currently assigned. A deferment from an assignment may be provided for a newly identified condition if the
          Airman‘s presence is considered essential. The purpose of such a deferment is to allow the Airman time to
          establish a special medical treatment program or educational program for the exceptional family member. When
          granted, the initial period of deferment is usually 12 months, after which an Airman may be reconsidered for
          PCS if otherwise eligible.
          15.9.8.2. BOP (Enlisted Only). The FTA BOP program is a reenlistment incentive; the career Airman BOP
          program is an incentive for other Airmen to continue an Air Force career. FTA in conjunction with reenlistment
          or retraining may request a PCS from CONUS-to-CONUS or PCS from OS-to-CONUS. FTA in the CONUS
          (only) may request a BOP to remain in place. A PCS BOP is not authorized from CONUS-to-OS or OS-to-OS.
          An in-place BOP is not authorized for Airmen assigned OS. Career Airmen may request a BOP to remain in
          place at a CONUS location or a PCS BOP for CONUS-to-CONUS assignment.
          15.9.8.3. Assignment of Military Couples (Join Spouse). Each Airman of a military couple serves in his or
          her own right. This means military couples must fulfill the obligations inherent to all Airmen. They are
          considered for assignments to fill valid manning requirements and must perform duties that require the skills in
          which they are trained. Provided these criteria are met, military couples may be considered for assignments
          where they can maintain a joint residence. Military couples share the responsibility for reducing family
342                                                                                 1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
            separation. They should not make decisions on future service, career development, or family planning based on
            the assumption they will always be assigned to the same location or that join-spouse assignment is guaranteed.
            15.9.8.4. Voluntary Stabilized Base Assignment Program (Enlisted Only). The Voluntary Stabilized Base
            Assignment Program provides Airmen a stabilized tour in exchange for volunteering for an assignment to a
            historically hard-to-fill location. Application procedures are listed in AFI 36-2110.
            15.9.8.5. Extended Long OS Tour Length. The extended long OS tour volunteer program applies to Airmen
            who volunteer for PCS OS to a long-tour location (one where the accompanied tour length is 24 months or
            more, and the unaccompanied tour length is more than 15 months). Airmen who volunteer for an extended long
            OS tour agree to serve the standard tour length plus an additional 12 months. Tour lengths for various OS
            locations are listed in the Joint Federal Travel Regulation, Volume 1, Appendix Q. Extended long OS tour
            volunteers are considered ahead of standard OS tour volunteers according to the priorities shown in AFI 36-
            2110. The 12-month extended tour period is in addition to the normal (accompanied or unaccompanied) long
            tour length the Airman must serve. A change in status affects the service retainability that must be obtained and
            the tour length the Airman will be required to serve. The requirement for additional service retainability may
            require an Airman to extend or reenlist and could affect selective reenlistment bonus (SRB) calculation.
            15.9.8.6. Educational Deferment. Airmen who have not yet been selected for a PCS may request deferment
            from assignment selection when they have nearly completed a vocational program or college degree
            requirements.
            15.9.8.7. High School Senior Assignment Deferment Program. The High School Senior Assignment
            Deferment Program allows SMSgts and below and officers through Lt Col to apply for a 1-year assignment
            deferment. Back-to-back deferments may be possible and military-married-to-military spouses may also apply.
            As in all situations, however, the needs of the Air Force will come first and will be the determining factor in
            granting deferments. Requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis, and deferments will be approved
            where possible.
            15.9.8.8. TDY. AFI 36-2110 provides instructions regarding TDY procedures. The maximum TDY period at
            any one location in a 12-month period is 180 days unless the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) grants a
            waiver. To the degree possible, Airmen are not selected for involuntary OS PCS while performing certain kinds
            of TDY. Additionally, if selected for involuntary PCS after one of these TDYs, the report not later than date
            (RNLTD) will not be within 120 days of the TDY completion date.
            15.9.8.9. Dependent Care and Adoption. All Airmen ensure dependent care arrangements are made when they
            are separated because of TDY or PCS. Military couples with dependents and single Airmen sponsors are
            expected to fulfill their military obligations on the same basis as other Airmen. They are eligible for worldwide
            duty and all assignments for which they qualify. To ensure all Airmen remain available for worldwide duty,
            they must have workable plans to provide parent-like care for their dependents as outlined in AFI 36-2908,
            Family Care Plans. Airmen who cannot or will not meet military commitments due to family needs will be
            considered for discharge. Airmen adopting children are given a limited time to complete the official adoption
            process and facilitate bonding. Airmen may be authorized deferment during the 6-month period following the
            date a child is officially placed in the Airmen‘s home. Airmen may also be authorized up to 21 days of
            permissive TDY that can be used in conjunction with ordinary leave.
      15.9.9. Time on Station (TOS) and Service Retainability.
            Minimum TOS requirements exist to provide continuity to an Airman‘s member‘s unit and, to the degree
            possible, reasonable periods of stable family life for Airmen. Further, upon selection for PCS, an Airman must
            have or be able to obtain certain minimum periods of obligated service depending on the type of PCS move.
            This committed service retainability ensures an Airman has a period of active duty remaining long enough to
            offset the costs associated with a PCS. Minimum TOS provides continuity to the gaining unit and stability to
            Airmen and their families following PCS. Some types of PCSs require TOS periods or obligated service periods
            more or less than the normal limits. Refer to AFI 36-2110 for the TOS and retainability requirements for
            specific types of PCS.
            15.9.9.1. CONUS-to-CONUS PCS. For most PCS moves within the CONUS, FTA and career Airmen must
            have at least 48 months of TOS, with the exception of FTA applying eligible for the FTA BOP Program.
            Special circumstances, such as completion of a training course in PCS status, have different TOS minimums.
            The service retainability requirement for a CONUS-to-CONUS PCS is 24 months regardless of career status.
            15.9.9.2. CONUS-to-OS PCS. FTA must have at least 12 months of TOS to go from CONUS to OS. Career
            Airmen require 24 months of TOS before an OS PCS. When notified of PCS selection, Airmen must have or be
AFPAM36-2241     1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                            343

          eligible to obtain sufficient service retainability to complete the full prescribed OS tour length elected. Airmen
          who do not have retainability may decline to obtain it or, if eligible, may retire instead of accepting a PCS.
          Declining to obtain retainability for PCS will affect a career Airman by making him or her ineligible for
          promotion and reenlistment. FTA become ineligible for most voluntary assignments. Airmen who are eligible
          and desire that their dependents accompany them at government expense during their OS tours must serve the
          ―accompanied by dependents‖ OS tour length. This tour is normally longer than the unaccompanied tour.
          Electing to serve the longer accompanied tour requires the Airman to obtain the obligated service retainability
          for the longer tour. Airmen who are either ineligible or decline to obtain the service retainability for the
          accompanied tour length will not receive approval for dependent travel at the government‘s expense or
          command sponsorship.
          15.9.9.3. OS-to-OS PCS. If an Airman is serving OS and is a volunteer for a PCS consecutive OS tour or in-
          place consecutive OS tour, the Airman must complete the full-prescribed tour at the current location and the
          full-prescribed OS tour at the new location or another full tour in place.
          15.9.9.4. OS-to-CONUS Reassignment. Reassignment from OS to CONUS requires the Airman, in most
          cases, to have or obtain at least 12 months of obligated service retainability. The exceptions are those Airmen
          serving at a dependent restricted short tour location of 12 months. Airmen who do not have retainability will be
          retained in the OS area involuntarily until their date of separation (DOS).
    15.9.10. Enlisted Quarterly Assignments Listing (EQUAL) and EQUAL-Plus.
          EQUAL provides Airmen a listing of the assignment requirements available for upcoming assignment cycles
          and allows them the opportunity to align personal preferences to actual Air Force needs. The listing identifies
          what assignments, by AFSC and grade, are available at particular locations. The EQUAL-Plus supplements the
          EQUAL and is used to advertise requirements for special duty assignments, joint and departmental assignments,
          short-notice OS assignments, and all CMSgt assignments. EQUAL-Plus shows upcoming requirements, any
          special qualifications an Airman needs to be eligible for selection, the available locations, reporting instructions,
          and points of contact for additional information. Both lists can be viewed on the Air Force Personnel Services
          Web page at https://gum-crm.csd.disa.mil/app/landing.
    15.9.11. Assignment Preferences (Enlisted Only).
          CMSgts and CMSgt-selects volunteer for assignments on EQUAL-Plus by notifying their assignment
          noncommissioned officer (NCO) at Headquarters Air Force Senior Leadership Management Office (AFSLMO).
          Notification can be made via telephone, e-mail, datafax, or electronic message. SMSgts and below will use the
          view/change assignment preference update feature in the virtual military personnel flight (vMPF) to record
          CONUS or OS assignment preferences. To enhance the chance for selection to a desired location, Airmen
          should consult the EQUAL and EQUAL-Plus listings. Upon completion of the update, a notice is produced and
          available for print. (Note: Each Airman is individually responsible for the currency and accuracy of assignment
          preferences.) When a change in status occurs such as marriage, the Airman should update preferences
          accordingly. Outdated preferences or no preferences on file will not be the basis for release of an Airman from
          an assignment for which selected.
          15.9.11.1. Home-Basing and Follow-On Assignment Programs. The purpose of these programs is to reduce
          PCS costs, reduce PCS turbulence, and increase stability for Airmen and their families by providing advance
          assignment consideration. The servicing military personnel section (MPS) must brief all eligible Airmen
          selected for or electing to serve an unaccompanied OS tour of 15 months or less on these programs. Airmen
          must either apply or decline to apply for these programs in writing. AFI 36-2110, Attachment 5, contains more
          information on these programs.
          15.9.11.2. Assignment of Family Members. Assignment of family members to the same duty location or unit
          is not prohibited, however, family members will not be assigned where one family member will or may hold a
          command or supervisory position over another family member. Such assignments result in, or may create a
          perception of, preferential treatment or loss of impartiality, thereby compromising the integrity of command and
          supervisory functions.
    15.9.12. PCS Cancellation by the Air Force:
          15.9.12.1. Once an Airman is selected for PCS and orders are published, cancellation of the assignment could
          impose a hardship on the Airman. Normally, a PCS is not cancelled within 60 days of the projected departure
          date unless the Airman cannot be effectively used at the projected location. The assignment OPR may authorize
          the cancellation.
344                                                                                   1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
             15.9.12.2. If the Airman indicates a hardship will exist as a result of the cancellation, then the MPS will direct
             the Airman to prepare a written statement containing the details of the hardship. The statement should be
             coordinated through the unit commander to the MPS. Upon receipt, the MPS advises the assignment OPR, who
             considers reinstatement of the original assignment, to provide an alternate assignment or confirms cancellation
             and provides the reasons why the Airman is required to remain at the present base.
             15.9.12.3. AFI 36-2110 contains additional information and also contains guidance in the case where an Airman
             has departed from his or her previous duty station and is en route to the new location.

Section 15D—Family Care
15.10. Policy.
      DoD policy is that the member is responsible for the care of family members during deployments and TDY, as at all
      other times. Failure to produce a family care plan within 60 days of the discussion with the commander, supervisor, or
      commander‘s designated representative may result in disciplinary action and/or administrative separation. In addition
      to a required family care plan, military members are strongly encouraged to have a will.
15.11. Members Who Must Have a Family Care Plan.
      Single-member parents with custody of children and military couples with dependents must have a family care plan.
      Members who are solely responsible for the care of a spouse, elderly family member, or adult family member with
      disabilities who is dependent on the member for financial, medical, or logistical support (housing, food, clothing,
      transportation, etc.) must also have a family care plan. This includes family members who have limited command of
      the English language, are unable to drive, or gain access to basic life-sustaining facilities. Members whose family
      circumstances or personal status change must notify their commander as soon as possible but no later than 30 days
      after any change in circumstance or personal status requires them to establish a family care plan.
15.12. Family Care Plans.
      These plans must include provisions for short-term absences (such as TDY for schooling or training) and long-term
      absences (such as operational deployments) and designate a caregiver for the affected family members. Financial
      arrangements may include powers of attorney, allotments, and other documents necessary for logistical movement of
      the family or caregiver should it become necessary. A statement signed by the caretaker and the member indicating
      that the caretaker has been thoroughly briefed on financial arrangements, logistical arrangements, military facilities,
      services, and benefits and entitlements of the family members must also be included. Additional items may be required
      to fit individual situations.
      15.12.1. Required Counseling:
             15.12.1.1. New Duty Station. Commanders or first sergeants counsel all Airmen with family members on AFI
             36-2908 during inprocessing. During this counseling, commanders and first sergeants must stress the
             importance of, and confirm the need for, family care certification by completing AF IMT 357, Family Care
             Certification. Commanders or first sergeants may not delegate counseling requirements. Note: For members
             who are geographically separated from the commander‘s location, commanders may delegate, in writing, the
             authority to counsel members and certify the AF IMT 357 to detachment or operating location chiefs.
             15.12.1.2. Annual Briefing. The commander or first sergeant is required to annually brief, individually, all
             military members who require an AF IMT 357 about their family care responsibilities. During this briefing, the
             commander or first sergeant signs the AF IMT 357 each time the plan is reviewed and certified, determining the
             actual workability of the family care plan. The member signs and dates the AF IMT 357 to document the
             briefing was completed.
      15.12.2. Remedial Action.
             Members who fail to make adequate and acceptable family care arrangements will have disciplinary or other
             actions taken against them.

Section 15E—Reenlistment and Retraining Opportunities
15.13. Selective Reenlistment Program (SRP).
      The SRP applies to all enlisted personnel. Its objective is to ensure the Air Force retains only Airmen who consistently
      demonstrate the capability and willingness to maintain high professional standards.
AFPAM36-2241     1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                      345

    15.13.1. Selective Reenlistment by Category.
          In the Air Force, reenlistment is a privilege, not a right. The SRP provides a process by which commanders and
          supervisors evaluate all first term, second term, and career Airmen. FTA receive SRP consideration when they
          are within 15 months of their expiration of term of service (ETS). Second term and career Airmen with less than
          19 years of total active federal military service (TAFMS) are considered within 13 months of the original ETS.
          Career Airmen also receive SRP consideration when within 13 months of completing 20 years of TAFMS.
          Once career Airmen have served beyond 20 years of TAFMS, they receive SRP consideration each time they
          are within 13 months of their original ETS.
    15.13.2. Responsibilities:
          15.13.2.1. Unit Commander. The unit commander has total SRP selection and nonselection authority for all
          Airmen. Reenlistment intent or retirement eligibility has no bearing on the SRP consideration process. Unit
          commanders approve or deny reenlistment and ensure selection or nonselection decisions are consistent with
          other qualitative decisions (such as promotion) and are based on substantial evidence. Commanders consider
          enlisted performance report (EPR) ratings, unfavorable information from any substantiated source, the Airman‘s
          willingness to comply with Air Force standards, and the Airman‘s ability (or lack thereof) to meet required
          training and duty performance levels when determining if a member may reenlist. Commanders may reverse
          their decisions at any time. Commanders do not use the SRP when involuntary separation is more appropriate.
          15.13.2.2. Immediate Supervisor. Supervisors provide unit commanders with recommendations concerning
          the Airman‘s career potential. Endorsing officials may perform the duties required by the immediate supervisor
          if the immediate supervisor is on leave or TDY. To ensure Airmen meet quality standards, immediate
          supervisors review the report on individual personnel (RIP) and the AF Form 1137, Unfavorable Information
          File Summary (if applicable). They then evaluate duty performance and leadership abilities.
    15.13.3. Procedures:
          15.13.3.1. Selection. The MPS sends each unit an SRP consideration roster that identifies assigned Airmen who
          require SRP consideration. The MPS also sends a RIP for each Airman being considered. The unit forwards the
          RIP to supervisors so that each supervisor‘s reenlistment recommendation can be documented. The supervisor
          should carefully evaluate the Airman‘s duty performance and review the Airman‘s personnel records before
          making a recommendation to the commander. A supervisor who decides to recommend the Airman for
          reenlistment places an ―X‖ in the appropriate block, signs the RIP, and returns it to the unit commander. The
          commander reviews the recommendation and evaluates the Airman‘s duty performance, future potential, and
          other pertinent information. The commander selects the Airman for reenlistment by annotating and signing the
          SRP roster. The commander‘s signature on the roster constitutes formal selection. The commander sends the
          SRP roster to the MPS for processing.
          15.13.3.2. Nonselection. If the supervisor decides not to recommend an Airman for reenlistment, he or she
          initiates an AF Form 418, Selective Reenlistment Program Consideration for Airmen in the Regular Air
          Force/Air Force Reserve, and completes Section I and Section II and forwards to the commander. The
          commander reviews the recommendation and other pertinent data and decides whether to select the Airman. If
          the commander does not select the Airman for reenlistment, the commander completes AF Form 418 and
          informs the Airman of the decision. During the interview, the commander must make sure the Airman
          understands the right to appeal the decision. The Airman must make known his or her intention within three
          workdays of the date the Airman acknowledges the nonselection decision. The Airman must submit the appeal
          to the MPS within 10 calendar days of the date he or she renders the appeal intent on the AF Form 418, Section
          V. The commander sends the AF Form 418 to the MPS after the Airman signs and initials the appropriate
          blocks.
    15.13.4. Appeals.
          Airmen have the right to appeal SRP nonselection decisions. The specific appeal authority is based on an
          Airman‘s TAFMS. FTA and career Airmen who will complete at least 20 years of TAFMS on their current ETS
          appeal SRP nonselection to their respective group commanders. The Airman‘s respective wing commander is
          the SRP appeal authority for second term and career Airmen who will complete fewer than 16 years of TAFMS
          on their current ETS. The SECAF is the SRP appeal authority for second term and career Airmen who will
          complete at least 16 years of TAFMS but fewer than 20 years of TAFMS on their current ETS. The decision of
          the appeal authority is final. The appeal authority‘s decision is documented on the AF Form 418, and the
          Airman is advised of the outcome.

15.14. Enlistment Extensions.
      Any Airman serving on a Regular Air Force enlistment may request an extension if he or she has a service-directed
      change reason and if it is in the best interest of the Air Force. Extensions are granted in whole-month increments. For
      example, if the individual needs 15 1/2 months of retainability for an assignment, the individual must request a 16-
      month extension. Voluntary extensions for all Airmen are limited to a maximum of 48 months per enlistment. In the
      event AFSCs are constrained, Air Staff may limit FTA extensions to a specified period. Certain situations (such as
      citizenship pending) may warrant exceptions to policy. Once approved, an extension has the legal effect of changing
      the enlistment agreement by extending the period of obligated service. Extensions can only be canceled if the reason
      for the extension no longer exists. For example, if a member was approved for an extension due to an assignment and
      that assignment was cancelled, the member could then cancel the extension.
15.15. High Year of Tenure (HYT).
      HYT provides the Air Force with another method of stabilizing the career structure of the enlisted force. HYT
      essentially represents the maximum number of years Airmen may serve in the grades of SrA through CMSgt. AFI 36-
      3208, Administrative Separation of Airmen, contains waiver provisions for Airmen who believe they have sufficient
      justification to warrant retention beyond their HYT, but the majority of Airmen are not permitted to reenlist or extend
      their enlistments if their new DOS exceeds their HYT. Airmen may be eligible to request an extension of enlistment to
      establish a DOS at HYT to separate or retire. Normally, Airmen must be within 2 years of their HYT before they can
      extend.
15.16. Selective Reenlistment Bonus (SRB).
      The SRB is a monetary incentive paid to enlisted members to attract reenlistments in, and retraining into, critical
      military skills with insufficient reenlistments to sustain the career force in those skills. HQ USAF adds and deletes
      skills from the SRB list as requirements change. The MPS is the best source of information on SRB skills.
      15.16.1. Zones.
            The SRB is paid in four zones:
            15.16.1.1. Zone A applies to Airmen reenlisting between 21 months and 6 years of TAFMS.
            15.16.1.2. Zone B applies to Airmen reenlisting between 6 and 10 years of TAFMS.
            15.16.1.3. Zone C applies to Airmen reenlisting between 10 and 14 years of TAFMS.
            15.16.1.4. Zone E applies to Airmen reenlisting between 18 and 20 years of TAFMS.
      15.16.2. Computing SRB Awards.
            The Air Force calculates the SRB on the basis of monthly base pay (the rate in effect on the date of discharge
            [day before reenlistment date] or the day before an extension begins) multiplied by the number of years and
            fractions of a year (months) of obligated service incurred on reenlistment, multiplied by the SRB multiple for
            the skill. The SRB is only payable for obligated service not exceeding 24 years of active service. The maximum
            SRB payable to eligible Airmen is $90,000 per zone. Eligible Airmen may receive an SRB in each zone but
            only one SRB per zone (for example, they can receive the last zone A payment and the first zone B payment
            during the same year). After taxes, the Air Force pays 50 percent of the bonus amount (less tax) at the time of
            reenlistment and the remaining 50 percent in equal installments on the anniversary of the reenlistment date.
15.17. Career Job Reservation (CJR) Program.
      Because of various career force size and composition restrictions, there is a limit to the number of FTA who can
      reenlist. The CJR Program exists to manage all FTA reenlistments by skill in order to prevent surpluses and shortages.
      15.17.1. When to Apply for a CJR.
            HQ USAF meets management requirements by establishing and maintaining a career job requirements file for
            each AFSC. An AFSC‘s career job requirements are distributed over a 12-month period. All eligible FTA must
            have an approved CJR in order to reenlist. Airmen are automatically placed on the CJR waiting list on the 1st
            duty day of the month during which they complete 35 months on their current enlistment (59 months for 6-year
            enlistees), but no later than the last duty day of the month during which they complete 43 months on their
            current enlistment (67 months for 6-year enlistees or 38 months for national call to service enlistees). To keep
            their approved CJR, Airmen must reenlist on or before the CJR expiration date.
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                       347

      15.17.2. CJR Waiting List.
            When the number of CJR applicants exceeds the number of available quotas, AFPC must use a rank-order
            process to determine which Airmen will receive an approved CJR. Applicants are ranked using the following
            factors: unfavorable information file (UIF) (automatic disqualifier), top three EPRs, current grade, projected
            grade, date of rank (DOR), TAFMS date (TAFMSD). Applicants are placed on the Air Force-wide career job
            applicant waiting list when there are no CJRs available. An Airman‘s position on the waiting list is subject to
            change as his or her rank order information changes or as new Airmen apply. Airmen may remain on the CJR
            waiting list until within 5 months of their DOS. Supervisors should encourage Airmen to pursue retraining into
            a shortage skill if a CJR is not immediately available.
      15.17.3. CJR in an Additionally Awarded AFSC.
            When Airmen are placed on the CJR waiting list in their AFSC, they may request a CJR in an additionally
            awarded AFSC if quotas are readily available, the AFSC is different from their CAFSC, and they possess at
            least a 3-skill level in the AFSC. Note: Receipt of an approved CJR in an additionally awarded AFSC does not
            in itself mean the Airmen will perform duty in the AFSC when they reenlist.
15.18. Air Force Retraining Program.
      The primary purpose of the Air Force Retraining Program is to give Airmen a choice and voice in their career path and
      maintain balance in the career force to meet mission requirements. Airmen in surplus career fields must be encouraged
      to retrain into shortage AFSCs. The Air Force Retraining Program provides guidance for two broad categories of
      Airmen: FTA retraining, and second term and career Airmen retraining.
      15.18.1. Career Airman Reenlistment Reservation System (CAREERS) Retraining.
            With few exceptions, the Air Force does not permit FTA to retrain until they complete a minimum of 35 months
            of their enlistment (4-year enlistees), or 59 months of their enlistment (6-year enlistees). Airmen must request
            consideration for retraining into a specialty that has retraining in requirements according to the Online
            Retraining Advisory. Each month, AFPC conducts the Quality Retraining Program board to place in rank-order
            all CAREERS retraining applications. Applicants are ranked for each retraining AFSC choice using these
            factors: most recent EPR, current grade, projected grade, next three EPRs, date of rank, TAFMSD, and the
            Airman‘s qualification examination score in the applicable area. If not approved after 3 consecutive months of
            consideration, the entire retraining application is disapproved.
      15.18.2. NCO Retraining Program.
            The purpose of the annual NCO Retraining Program is to move NCOs from AFSCs with significant overages
            into AFSCs with NCO shortages. This program consists of two phases: voluntary and involuntary. Air Staff
            determines retraining objectives.
      15.18.3. Online Retraining Advisory.
            AFPC maintains the Online Retraining Advisory, an up-to-date list of all AFSCs showing retraining
            requirements. The advisory is readily available and a key tool to advise members of retraining opportunities.
            AFI 36-2626, Airman Retraining Program, establishes retraining eligibility and application procedures.

Section 15F—Benefits and Services
15.19. Veterans Affairs (VA) Benefits.
      The VA offers a wide range of benefits to the Nation‘s veterans, service members, and their families. VA benefits and
      services fall into these major categories: disability benefits, education benefits, vocational rehabilitation and
      employment, home loans, burial benefits, dependents‘ and survivors‘ benefits, life insurance, and health care. Airmen
      requiring specific information on their VA benefits can retrieve information at www.va.gov. Contact the closest VA
      department for eligibility requirements.
      15.19.1. Disability Benefits.
            Retirees with a compensable service-connected disability may, on application, be paid by the VA for that
            disability. Disability compensation varies with the degree of disability and the number of a veteran‘s
            dependents, and is paid monthly. The benefits are not subject to federal or state income tax. The Defense
            Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS)-Cleveland Center and VA pay experts should explain this complex
            subject with varying standards on an individual basis.
348                                                                                  1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
      15.19.2. Educational Benefits.
            Department of Defense directive 1322.08E, Voluntary Education Programs for Military Personnel, states these
            programs shall be established and maintained within the DoD that provide service members with educational
            opportunities in which they may participate voluntarily during their off-duty time or at such other times as
            authorized by Military Services policies. Additionally, voluntary education programs shall provide educational
            opportunities comparable to those available to citizens outside the military; be available to all Regular Air Force
            personnel regardless of their duty location; and include courses and services provided by accredited
            postsecondary vocational and technical schools, colleges, and universities.
      15.19.3. Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment.
            The VA helps veterans with service-connected disabilities prepare for, find, and keep suitable employment. For
            veterans with serious service-connected disabilities, VA also offers services to improve their ability to live as
            independently as possible.
      15.19.4. Home Loans.
            The main purpose of the VA home loan program is to help veterans finance the purchase of homes with
            favorable loan terms at a rate of interest competitive with the rate charged on other types of mortgage loans. For
            VA housing loan purposes, the term ―veteran‖ includes certain members of the Selected Reserve, Regular Air
            Force personnel, and certain categories of spouses.
      15.19.5. Burial Benefits.
            Service members and veterans (who were discharged under conditions other than dishonorable) who die may be
            eligible for VA burial benefits including burial in a VA national cemetery, government-furnished headstone or
            marker, presidential memorial certificate, burial flag, and, in some cases, reimbursement of burial expenses.
      15.19.6. Dependents’ and Survivors’ Benefits.
            Dependency and indemnity compensation is a benefits program that pays a monthly payment to a surviving
            spouse, child, or parent of a veteran because of a service-connected death of the veteran. Military services
            provide payment, called a death gratuity, in the amount of $100,000 to the next of kin of service members who
            die while on active duty (including those who die within 120 days of separation) as a result of service-connected
            injury or illness.
      15.19.7. Life Insurance.
            VA insurance programs were developed to provide insurance benefits for veterans and service members who
            may not be able to get insurance from private companies because of the extra risks involved in military service
            or a service-connected disability. At the time of separation from service, Servicemembers‘ Group Life
            Insurance (SGLI) can be converted to either Veterans‘ Group Life Insurance (VGLI) or a commercial plan
            through participating companies. SGLI coverage continues for 120 days after separation at no charge. Coverage
            of $10,000 is also automatically provided for dependent children of members insured under SGLI with no
            premium required.
      15.19.8. Health Care.
            In October 1996, Congress passed Public Law 104-262, Veterans‘ Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996.
            This legislation paved the way for creation of a standardized, enhanced health benefits plan available to all
            enrolled veterans. The law also simplified the process for veterans to receive services. Like other standard
            health care plans, the medical benefits package emphasizes preventive and primary care, offering a full range of
            outpatient and inpatient services, including preventive services (including immunizations, screening tests, and
            health education and training classes); primary health care; diagnosis and treatment; surgery (including
            outpatient surgery; mental health and substance abuse treatment; home health care; respite (inpatient), hospice,
            and palliative care; urgent and limited emergency care; and drugs and pharmaceuticals.
15.20. Retirement Benefits.
      Enlisted members are eligible to retire if they have 20 years of TAFMS and there are no restrictions per AFI 36-3203.
      Enlisted members must apply for retirement. Otherwise, they will separate on their DOS or ETS. Officers must have
      20 years of TAFMS and 10 years of total active federal commissioned service to be eligible to retire. A retirement
      application may be submitted through vMPF up to 12 months, but no less than 120 days, before the minimum required
      service. Every individual who hopes to retire one day should be familiar with this information. It is not all-inclusive,
AFPAM36-2241           1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                             349

      and there are exceptions. Every military member should seek personal counseling from the Total Force Contact Center
      before making firm plans. AFPC/DPSOR provides periodic webinars to explain the retirement process.
      15.20.1. Place of Retirement.
              In general, a member may retire in the CONUS. Members assigned to a duty station in the CONUS retire at the
              duty station. If the member is OS, the member and family can proceed to the final CONUS home of selection. If
              the member elects to retire OS and live permanently in that country, he or she must comply with command and
              host government residency rules before the date of retirement.
      15.20.2. Retired Pay.
              The date initially entered military service (DIEMS) normally determines which of the three existing retirement
              pay plans applies to a member. DIEMS is the date an individual was initially enlisted, inducted, or appointed in
              a regular or reserve component of a uniformed service as a commissioned officer, warrant officer, or enlisted
              member. The DIEMS is a fixed date that is not subject to adjustment because of a break in service. Current
              active military personnel will fall under one of the three retirement plans described in Table 15.1.
Table 15.1. Retirement Pay Plans.

Notes:
1. COLA is applied annually to retired pay.
2. High-3 is a reference to the average of the high 3 years or, more specifically, the high 36 months of basic pay as used in the
formula.
3. If a member is demoted or an officer is retired in a lower grade as a result of an Officer Grade Determination, the retired pay
plan is Final Basic Pay of the lower, retired grade (10 United States Code, Section 1407(f)).
15.21. Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP):
       15.21.1. Military pay stops when a member dies. The SBP was established by Congress, effective 21 September 1972,
       to provide a monthly income to survivors of retired military personnel upon the member‘s death when retired pay
       stops. The SBP is a government program for retiring members to ensure after their death that their eligible survivors
       receive a portion of their military retired pay in the form of a monthly annuity. The plan was structured so a surviving
       spouse cannot outlive the annuity, and it has cost-of-living adjustments (COLA) incorporated so the annuity increases
       with inflation. Regular Air Force members with a spouse or dependent children are automatically covered by the SBP
       at no cost while they remain on active duty. The member‘s death must be classified in line of duty in order for an
       annuity to be payable if the member is not yet retirement eligible (has not accrued 20 years of active duty) on the date
       of death. The annuity payable is 55 percent of the retired pay the member would have been entitled to receive if retired
       with a total disability rating on the date of death. An annuity may also be payable if the member‘s death is classified
       not in line of duty, as long as the member was retirement eligible on the date of death. In this case, annuity payable is
       55 percent of the retired pay the member would have been entitled to receive if retired for years of service on the date
       of death. The surviving spouse of a member who dies in the line of duty while on active duty may request the SBP be
       paid only to the member‘s children, avoiding the reduction caused by a spouse‘s receipt of dependency and indemnity
       compensation, the survivor benefits paid by the Department of Veteran Affairs when a member‘s death is determined
       to have resulted from a service-connected cause.
       15.21.2. Prior to retiring, each member must decide whether to continue SBP coverage into retirement. The retired pay
       of those members who elect to participate is reduced by monthly premiums. The SBP is a unique plan: government-
       subsidized premiums are deducted from a participating member‘s retired pay before taxes. SBP is the only program
       that enables a portion of military retired pay to be paid to a member‘s survivors.
       15.21.3. SBP premiums and the annuity payments to the beneficiary depend on what is called the ―base amount‖ that
       is elected as the basis of coverage. A service member‘s base amount can be the full monthly retired pay or just a
       portion, down to as little as $300. Full coverage means full-retired pay is elected as the base amount. The base amount
       is tied to a member‘s retired pay. When retired pay gets a COLA, so does the base amount, and as a result, so do
       premiums and the annuity payments.
       15.21.4. Generally SBP is an irrevocable decision. However, under limited circumstances, you may withdraw from
       SBP (Figure 15.1) or change your coverage. As an SBP participant, you have a 1-year window to terminate SBP
       coverage between the second and third anniversary following the date you begin to receive retired pay. None of the
       premiums you paid will be refunded, and no annuity will be payable upon your death. Your covered spouse or former
       spouse must consent to the withdrawal. Termination is permanent, and participation may not be resumed under any
       circumstance barring future enrollment. The SBP also has a ―paid-up‖ feature that permits members who have attained
       age 70 and who have paid SBP premiums for 360 months to stop paying premiums but remain active participants in
       the plan. Additional information can be attained through the local military personnel section office or the airman and
       family readiness centers.
Figure 15.1. Stop Coverage.

                    Premiums stop when there is no longer an eligible beneficiary in a premium category, such
                    as:
                    - Children are all too old for benefits and have no incapacity, or
                    - A spouse is lost through death or divorce, or
                    - An insurable interest person dies, or coverage is terminated.

15.22. Airman and Family Readiness Center (A&FRC):
       15.22.1. A&FRC Services.
       A&FRC services are designed to assist commanders in assessing and supporting the welfare of the military community
       and building a strong sense of community and support within the Air Force. The A&FRC supports mission readiness
AFPAM36-2241     1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                       351

    by helping Airmen and their families adapt to the emerging changes and demands of a mobile military lifestyle. Core
    support is based around a community readiness consultant model that provides leadership consultation at the unit level
    to help define the needs of their people and design programs and services that target those needs. A&FRC offers core
    services that include the following:
          15.22.1.1. Members are required to attend mandatory predeployment briefings that educate Airmen and families
          on (1) preparing for the deployment; (2) sustainment support for family members, including extended family
          and ―nearest and dearest‖; and (3) mandatory reintegration briefings that help Airmen prepare for reuniting with
          their families and friends, and for handling combat stressors that they may encounter.
          15.22.1.2. Discovery resource centers provide access to computers to gain information, referral, and follow-up
          assistance. Staff members are available to assist with clarifying needs, conducting research, and locating

          Airmen and families with information and referrals regarding local school districts and other educational
          options including home schooling, private schools, charter schools, and cyber schools.
          15.22.1.6. Personal and work life skills education includes prevention and enrichment services/classes/
          information.
          15.22.1.7. Relocation information, education, and assistance on how to access web tools to help Airmen and
          their families plan their next move. A&FRCs work with the base agencies and unit monitors to coordinate
          sponsor training.
          15.22.1.8. The Transition Assistance Program (TAP) provides support and education for career planning and
          information on veterans‘ benefits to Airmen and their families transitioning out of the military.
          15.22.1.9. The A&FRC assists the installation commander and collaborates with other base volunteer agencies
          to recruit, train, place, and recognize volunteer service. The Air Force Volunteer Excellence Award is a
          commander‘s program to recognize volunteer contributions across the installation.
          15.22.1.10. Crisis assistance that provides immediate, short-term assistance to individuals and families with
          challenging life situations.
          15.22.1.11. Military family life consultants deliver short-term, solution-focused, nonmedical counseling and
          support services such as seminars, classes, etc. Any issues requiring intervention and/or treatment must be
          referred to the appropriate helping agency. In addition, ―out of scope‖ work defined by DoD (such as long-term
          mental health issues, PTSD or other severe trauma disorders, personality disorders, repeated use of
          dysfunctional coping mechanisms, treatment for mental health or substance abuse, etc.) will be referred to
          appropriate providers at mental health or TRICARE.
          15.22.1.12. Loans and grants from the Air Force Aid Society (AFAS) are administered by the A&FRC staff.
          Note: AFAS also provides numerous community enhancement programs that support deployment resources,
          child care needs, spouse education, and more.
          15.22.1.13. Casualty assistance representatives and survivor benefit plan counselors administer casualty
          reporting, notification and assistance programs and provide counseling on benefits offered by a wide variety of
          programs including Veterans Affairs and the Social Security Administration.
          15.22.1.14. Military OneSource, a virtual service that supports the needs of Airmen and their family members in
          any life situations, accessible at 1-800-342-9647, or http://militaryonesource.com.
          15.22.1.15. A&FRC staff works with the Air Force Wounded Warrior Program (AFW2) program to ensure that
          members who are injured and ill due to combat are provided one-on-one assistance.
352                                                                                    1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
              15.22.1.16. The Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) is a partnership between the medical,
              assignments, and A&FRC communities to support families with special needs by identifying medical issues,
              ensuring families are assigned to the appropriate location for support/service and providing information and
              referrals to assist the family.
       15.22.2. Emergency Family Assistance Center (EFAC).
                At the direction of the installation commander, the A&FRC stands up an EFAC to provide disaster response
                in the event of a natural, mass casualty, or manmade disaster. Via the EFAC, individuals affected by the
                disaster can receive support and leadership information in a one-stop environment.
15.23. American Red Cross.
       American Red Cross services to the Armed Forces program provide support to service members and their families in
       times of crisis. While serving 1.4 million active duty personnel and their immediate family members, the American
       Red Cross also reaches out to the 1.2 million members of the National Guard and Reserves and their immediate family
       members who reside in nearly every community in the United States and its territories. The core service is emergency
       communication messages. All American Red Cross services to military members and their families are provided free
       of charge 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. The American Red Cross assists active duty personnel, National Guard
       members, Reservists, Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Coast Guard,
       U.S. Public Health Service, and veterans. See Figure 15.2 for services available to inactive and active service
       members.
       15.23.1. Use the following guidance to contact the American Red Cross for assistance.
              15.23.1.1. Regular Air Force members stationed in the United States and family members residing with them
              call 877-272-7337 (toll free).
              15.23.1.2. Family members who do not reside in the service member‘s household, members of the National
              Guard and Reserves, retirees and civilians call their local American Red Cross chapter, which is listed in local
              telephone books and online at http://www.redcross.org/where/where.html.
              15.23.1.3. Regular Air Force members and DoD civilians stationed OS and family members residing with them
              call base or installation operators or the American Red Cross office at the OS location.
              15.23.1.4. The caseworker will need the following information concerning the service member:
              15.23.1.4.1. Full name.
              15.23.1.4.2. Rank/rating.
              15.23.1.4.3. Branch of service (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard).
              15.23.1.4.4. Social security number or date of birth.
              15.23.1.4.5. Military address.
              15.23.1.4.6. Information about the deployed unit and home base unit (for deployed service members only).
Figure 15.2. Red Cross Services.

      Emergency Communication Services
      When a military family experiences a crisis, the American Red Cross is there to assist by providing emergency
      communications twenty-four hours a day, 365 days a year. The American Red Cross relays urgent messages
      containing accurate, factual, complete and verified descriptions of the emergency to service members stationed
      anywhere in the world, including ships at sea, embassies and remote locations. American Red Cross emergency
      communications services keep military personnel in touch with their families following the death or serious illness
      of an immediate family member, the birth of a service member‘s child or grandchild or when a family experiences
      other emergencies.
      No matter where a military member and their family are stationed, they can rest assured the American Red Cross
      will deliver their notifications in times of crisis. Even if the service member receives notification of an emergency
      through an e-mail or a phone call, American Red Cross-verified information assists commanding officers in
      making a decision regarding emergency leave. Without this verification, the service member may not be able to
      come home during a family emergency.
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                           353

    Financial Assistance
    The American Red Cross works under partnership agreements with the Air Force Aid Society, Army Emergency
    Relief, Coast Guard Mutual Assistance, and Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society to provide quality, reliable
    financial assistance to eligible applicants 24/7/365. Types of assistance include financial assistance for emergency
    travel, burial of a loved one, assistance to avoid privation, etc.
    Casualty Travel Assistance Program
    The Casualty Travel Assistance Program provides travel assistance for two immediate family members to attend a
    memorial or funeral service for a service member killed on active duty in the combat zone and to travel to the
    bedside of a service member wounded in the combat zone. The assistance includes funding for roundtrip airfare,
    lodging costs, food, and incidentals.
    Coping with Deployments
    Psychological First Aid for Military Families was developed out of the American Red Cross‘s continuing
    commitment to serve military families. This course was designed specifically for the spouses, parents, siblings, and
    significant others of service members. It provides useful information on how to strengthen your ability to
    successfully respond to the challenges that military family members may encounter throughout the deployment
    cycle. It also explains how to provide psychological first aid to others experiencing stressful feelings or events.
    Veterans Affairs Volunteer Services
    Volunteers from American Red Cross chapters and offices on military installations serve in 153 VA hospitals
    around the Nation. It is their way of saying thank you to that special group of men and women who answered their
    country‘s call and who are now cared for each day in VA medical centers. The opportunities for volunteers to meet
    the great needs in these centers include: transporting patients to and from treatment sessions; working in libraries;
    bringing magazines, books, and comfort items to patients; providing companionship and personal services to
    patients; and working in hospital offices, laboratories, and at information desks.
    Veterans Claims for Benefits
    The American Red Cross provides assistance and information in preparing, developing, and obtaining sufficient
    evidence to support applicants‘ claims for veterans‘ benefits and also assists claimants who seek to appeal to the
    Board of Veterans‘ Appeals.
    Information and Referral Services
    The American Red Cross offers confidential services to all military personnel- active duty, National Guard and
    Reserves-and their families. Counseling, guidance, information, referrals and other social services are available
    through our worldwide network of chapters and offices on military installations. American Red Cross chapters are
    listed in local telephone books and at your local American Red Cross. As more and more National Guard and
    Reserve units are called to full-time duty status, counseling has become increasingly important to prepare the
    civilian-based military members and their families for the period of activation. Because members of the National
    Guard and Reserve typically live in civilian neighborhoods, they and their families frequently have difficulty
    accessing much-needed, military-related social services.
    Volunteer Opportunities
    The American Red Cross depends on volunteers which constitute about 95 percent of the American Red Cross
    workforce. Volunteers make it possible to provide services, such as responding to nearly 70,000 disasters every
    year; teaching millions of people first aid; cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR); swimming and other lifesaving
    skills; helping the American Red Cross collect approximately 6.3 million units of blood from roughly 3.7 million
    volunteer donors; and, as part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Network, reconnecting hundreds of
    families separated by war and disaster around the world.


Section 15G—Personnel Records and Individual Rights
15.24. Personal Information File (PIF):
      15.24.1. Commanders and supervisors perform many personnel management functions requiring them to keep files on
      assigned personnel. AFI 36-2608, Military Personnel Records System, authorizes the use and maintenance of the
      commander‘s or supervisor‘s PIFs. Unit commanders or equivalents maintain discretion to create PIFs on all assigned
354                                                                                    1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
      personnel, but PIFs are mandatory for officer personnel who receive a letter of admonishment or a letter of counseling.
      If a PIF is established, use of AF Form 10A, Personnel Information File, Record of Performance, Officer Command
      Selection Record Group, is required. Contents are governed by AFI 36-2608. Custodians must keep the PIFs current
      and secured in a locked area or container to protect against misuse or unauthorized access.
      15.24.2. According to the Privacy Act of 1974, a person who is the subject of the record may request access to this
      record at any time. Individuals have the right to review their PIF at any time and challenge or question the need for
      documents in the file. The contents are available to commanders, raters, first sergeants, senior raters, Air Force Office
      of Special Investigations (AFOSI), and staff judge advocate personnel as warranted. The release and review of the PIF
      contents in these instances are for ―official business‖ or ―routine use‖ according to AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy
      Program.
      15.24.3.   Guidance     provided     according     to   the     Air    Force     Records      Disposition        Schedule
      (https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm) for retaining and disposing of the PIF.
15.25. The Privacy Act (PA):
      15.25.1. The Privacy Act of 1974 as amended (http://www.justice.gov/opcl/1974privacyact-overview.htm) establishes
      a code of fair information practices that govern the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of personally
      identifiable information (PII) about individuals that is maintained in systems of records by federal agencies. Privacy
      Act System of Records is defined in the Act as ―a group of any records under the control of any agency from which
      information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying
      particular assigned to the individual‖ (PII, most often the social security number). Individual is defined in the Act as ―a
      citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.‖ Privacy Act rights are personal to
      the individual who is the subject of the record and cannot be asserted derivatively by others. Note, however, that the
      parent of any minor, or the legal guardian of an incompetent, may act on behalf of that individual. The Privacy Act
      prohibits the disclosure of information from a system of records absent the written consent of the subject individual,
      unless the disclosure is pursuant to 1 of 12 statutory exceptions.
      15.25.2. The Privacy Act limits the collection of PII to what the law or Executive Orders authorize. System of Records
      Notices (SORN) must be published in the Federal Register allowing the public a 30-day comment period. Such
      collection must not conflict with the rights guaranteed by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. A Privacy Act
      statement must be given when individuals are asked to provide PII about themselves for collection in a system of
      records. If a social security number is being requested, the individual must be told the law or authority for requesting
      it, how it will be used, and whether providing it is voluntary or mandatory.
      15.25.3. In addition to specifying disclosure procedures, the Privacy Act governs the maintenance of systems of
      records. The Act provides individuals with a means by which to seek access to and amend their records and sets forth
      agency record-keeping requirements. Individuals have the right to request access or amendment to their records in a
      system; however, the SECAF can exempt certain systems of records from this provision of the law. PII in a system of
      records must be safeguarded to ensure ―need to know‖ access of the records and to avoid actions that could result in
      harm, embarrassment, or unfairness to the individual. The law limits the uses of records to the purposes that are stated
      in the SORN, as published in the Federal Register. SORNs for Air Force records systems can be found at
      http://dpclo.defense.gov/privacy/SORNs/component/airforce/index.html. DoD personnel may disclose records to other
      offices in the DoD when there is an official ―need to know‖ and to other federal government agencies or individuals
      when it is a ―routine use‖ published in the SORN or as authorized by a Privacy Act exception. In addition, information
      may be released for a disclosed specified purpose with the subject‘s consent. Records managers should keep an
      accounting of all releases unless they are for DoD official business or the information is required to be released
      pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.
      15.25.4. For further information, definitions, exemptions, exceptions, or responsibilities and procedures for
      safeguarding and reporting of PII breaches, consult AFI 33-332. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
      defines a PII breach as, ―A loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition,
      unauthorized access, or any similar term referring to situations where persons other than authorized users and for an
      other than authorized purpose have access or potential access to personally identifiable information, whether physical
      or electronic.‖
15.26. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).
      The FOIA provides access to federal agency records (or parts of these records) except those protected from release by
      nine specific exemptions. FOIA requests are written requests that cite or imply the FOIA. The law establishes rigid
      time limits for replying to requesters and permits assessing fees in certain instances. The FOIA imposes mandatory
      time limits of 20 workdays to either deny the request or release the requested records. The law permits an additional
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                         355

      10-workday extension in unusual circumstances specifically outlined in the FOIA. (Note: Denials require notification
      of appeal rights. Requester can file an appeal or litigate.) Refer to DoD 5400.7-R Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-302,
      Freedom of Information Act Program, for specific policy and procedures on the FOIA and for guidance on disclosing
      records to the public.
15.27. Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records (AFBCMR):
      15.27.1. The AFBCMR is the highest level of administrative review. It is a powerful, yet simple system for correcting
      military records. Unless procured by fraud, its decision is final and binding on all Air Force officials and government
      agencies. The AFBCMR‘s authority, jurisdiction, and policy are explained in AFI 36-2603, Air Force Board for
      Correction of Military Records. AFPAM 36-2607, Applicants‘ Guide to the Air Force Board for Correction of
      Military Records, contains additional information.
      15.27.2. With few exceptions, most records generated by the Air Force may be corrected by the AFBCMR. For
      instance, EPRs may be voided, upgraded, or rewritten; discharges and reenlistment eligibility codes may be upgraded;
      survivor benefit elections may be changed; leave may be credited; Article 15 actions may be voided; reinstatement
      into the Air Force may be achieved, etc. Records may be changed, voided, or created as necessary to correct an error
      or to remove an injustice, and applicable monetary benefits are recomputed based on the records changed. The
      AFBCMR cannot, however, change the verdict of a courts-martial imposed after 5 May 1950 but may, on the basis of
      clemency, change the punishment imposed by the final reviewing authority.
      15.27.3. Other administrative remedies must be exhausted before applying to the AFBCMR. Applications (DD Form
      149, Application for Correction of Military Record Under the Provisions of Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 1552) will be
      returned if applicants have not sought relief through the appropriate administrative process. For example, EPR appeals
      must first be submitted through Evaluation Reports Appeal Board (ERAB), under the provisions of AFI 36-2401,
      Correcting Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Reports.
      15.27.4. Application to the AFBCMR is a simple process. However, favorable consideration of the application by the
      AFBCMR depends on all the facts and circumstances of the case and how well the request is supported by
      documentary evidence. The AFBCMR is not an investigative body and except in those rare cases where a personal
      appearance is granted and testimony is taken, the AFBCMR bases its decision on the evidence contained in the case
      file. This normally consists of the military record, an advisory opinion from the Air Force office of primary
      responsibility, statements, arguments, and records the applicant provides. Sufficient evidence must be provided to
      support a contention that the applicant suffered an error or injustice. The type and extent of evidence necessary to
      support the case depends on the nature of the request.
      15.27.5. Cases are reviewed in executive session by a panel of three members, randomly selected from the AFBCMR
      membership. These members, GS-15s and above, are appointed from the executive part of the department and serve at
      the discretion of the Secretary. However, service on the board is a collateral volunteer duty. Applicants may request a
      personal appearance before the AFBCMR; however, a personal appearance is not a statutory right and is granted solely
      at the discretion of the board. Few personal appearances are granted. Board members decide whether an error or
      injustice exists in each case, and they vote to grant, partially grant, or deny on this basis. If the board recommends
      favorable relief, the case is forwarded to the SECAF‘s designee for final decision. Requests for reconsideration of a
      decision apply only if the applicant can provide newly discovered relevant evidence that was not reasonably available
      when the original application was submitted. The AFBCMR decides whether a case will be reconsidered.
      15.27.6. Applications involving an administrative correction without a referral to the AFBCMR could be resolved
      within 90 days. Applications formally considered by the AFBCMR are processed within 10 to 18 months. 10 U.S.
      Code, Section 1557, Timeliness Standards for Disposition of Applications Before Corrections Boards, provides
      oversight and clearance deadlines for the correction of military records review and decision. After fiscal year 2010, 90
      percent of the cases must be completed within 10 months.
15.28. Air Force Discharge Review Board (AFDRB):
      15.28.1. The AFDRB affords former Air Force members the opportunity to request review of their discharge (except
      for a discharge or dismissal by general court-martial). The objective of a discharge review is to examine an applicant‘s
      administrative discharge and to change the characterization of service, the reason for discharge, or both, based on
      standards of propriety or equity. Bad conduct discharges, given as a result of a special court-martial, may be upgraded
      on clemency factors.
      15.28.2. Before November 1975, the AFDRB conducted reviews only in Washington DC. Since then, a traveling
      board concept was added to conduct regional hearings throughout the United States for applicants who wish to
      personally present their cases to the AFDRB (approximately a third of the total cases). In contrast with the AFBCMR,
356                                                                                 1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
      a personal appearance before the board is a statutory right. The applicant or the applicant‘s counsel may appear before
      the board in Washington DC (Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland) or at a regional location. The application can also
      be considered on a record review basis. The board reviews the case based on documentation in the military record and
      any additional evidence provided by the applicant. The AFDRB procedures allow the applicant latitude in presenting
      evidence, witnesses, and testimony in support of his or her case.
      15.28.3. Airmen separated under circumstances (except retirement) that make them ineligible for reenlistment and
      officers discharged under adverse conditions are briefed by the MPS at the time of their discharge about the AFDRB
      process. They are provided with a discharge review fact sheet and an application (DD Form 293, Application for the
      Review of Discharge from the Armed Forces of the United States) to apply through the SECAF, Review Boards
      Office, to the AFDRB.
      15.28.4. No minimum waiting period is required to submit an application, but the AFDRB may not review requests
      submitted beyond 15 years of the DOS. In spite of the briefings and information contained in the fact sheet, some
      common misperceptions and myths remain. The facts are:
            15.28.4.1. No provisions exist to automatically upgrade a discharge.
            15.28.4.2. The military will not pay travel expenses to AFDRB hearing sites.
            15.28.4.3. The military will not bear the cost of private counsel.
            15.28.4.3.1. Members may engage counsel at their own expense; however, a number of organizations provide
            counsel at no cost or a representative to assist applicants. These include national service organizations such as
            the American Legion, Disabled American Veterans, and Veterans of Foreign Wars.
15.29. The Virtual Military Personnel Flight (vMPF).
      The vMPF is a suite of applications that provides the ability to conduct some of the Airmen‘s personnel business on
      line. Examples of applications available now include application for humanitarian reassignment, duty history inquiry,
      OS returnee counseling, and reenlistment eligibility inquiry.

Section 15H—Awards and Decorations
15.30. Introduction.
      Air Force personnel make many personal and professional sacrifices to ensure the Air Force accomplishes its mission
      and is a respected part of society. Acts of valor, heroism, exceptional service, and outstanding achievement deserve
      special recognition. The Air Force Awards and Decorations Program establishes guidance for recognizing individuals
      and groups. This program is designed to foster morale, incentive, and esprit de corps. People or units who receive
      awards and decorations must clearly demonstrate sustained and superior performance. Questions about the Air Force
      Awards and Decorations Program may be directed to the local force support squadron (FSS).
15.31. Awards:
      15.31.1. Service and Campaign Awards.
            These awards recognize members for honorable active military service during periods of war or national
            emergency. They also recognize individuals who participate in specific or significant military operations and
            who participate in specific types of service while serving on active duty or as a member of the Reserve forces.
            Individuals should keep copies of their TDY and PCS orders and travel vouchers to help prove entitlement to
            service and campaign awards. Additional service and campaign awards can be found in AFI 36-2803, The Air
            Force Awards and Decorations Program.
            15.31.1.1. Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal (GWOTEM) and the Global War on
            Terrorism Service Medal (GWOTSM). Two of the most common service awards worn by Air Force members
            today are the GWOTEM and the GWOTSM. They were established in March 2003. The GWOTEM is awarded
            to members who deployed on or after 11 September 2001 for service in Operations Enduring Freedom or Iraqi
            Freedom. The GWOTSM is awarded to members who participated in or served in support of the global war on
            terror-specified operations on or after 11 September 2001 and a date to be determined.
            15.31.1.2. Afghanistan Campaign Medal (ACM) and the Iraq Campaign Medal (ICM). Two other service
            medals being issued are the ACM and ICM. The ACM and ICM were established on 29 November 2004 and
            recognize service members who serve or have served in the respective countries in support of Operations
            Enduring Freedom or Iraqi Freedom. Effective 1 May 2005, members deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq receive
AFPAM36-2241     1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                         357

          the respective campaign medal in lieu of the GWOTEM. Campaign stars are worn on the ribbons to designate
          official campaign periods as established by the DoD.
          15.31.1.3. Korea Defense Service Medal (KDSM). In February 2004, DoD approved the Korea Defense
          Service Medal for Regular Air Force, AFR, and ANG personnel as recognition for military service in the
          Republic of Korea and the surrounding waters after 28 July 1954 and a future date to be determined.
          15.31.1.4. Humanitarian Service Medal (HSM). The Humanitarian Service Medal is awarded to members of
          the U.S. Armed Forces and their Reserve components who, after 1 April 1975, distinguished themselves as
          individuals or members of U.S. military units or ships by meritorious direct participation in a significant
          military act or operation of humanitarian nature. ―Direct participation‖ is any member assigned directly to the
          humanitarian operation providing hands-on participation. A bronze service star denotes subsequent awards. A
          listing of approved operations for the HSM are identified in DoDM 1348.33, Manual of Military Decorations
          and Awards.
    15.31.2. Unit Awards.
          These awards are presented to U.S. military units that distinguish themselves during peacetime or in action
          against hostile forces or an armed enemy of the United States. To maintain the integrity of unit awards, the acts
          or services must be clearly and distinctly above that of similar units. Only grant one award for the same act,
          achievement, or service. Only 10 percent of similar units assigned to a command are recommended annually.
          The unit‘s entire service must have been honorable during the distinguished act. An organization may display
          the award elements of a unit award. Designated subordinate units of the organization may also share in the
          award; however, higher organizations may not. All assigned or attached people who served with a unit during a
          period for which a unit award was awarded are authorized the appropriate ribbon if they directly contributed to
          the mission and accomplishments of the unit. Questions concerning eligibility to wear a specific unit award may
          be directed to the local FSS. The five most common unit awards worn by Air Force members today are Gallant
          Unit Citation (GUC), the Meritorious Unit Award (MUA), the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award (AFOUA),
          the Air Force Organizational Excellence Award (AFOEA), and the Joint Meritorious Unit Award (JMUA).
          15.31.2.1. Gallant Unit Citation (GUC). The GUC was approved by the SECAF in March 2004 and is
          awarded to Air Force units for extraordinary heroism in action against an armed enemy of the United States
          while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force on or after 11 September
          2001. The unit must have performed with marked distinction under difficult and hazardous conditions in
          accomplishing its mission so as to set it apart from and above other units participating in the same conflict. The
          GUC will normally be earned by units that have participated in single or successive actions covering relatively
          brief time spans.
          15.31.2.2. Meritorious Unit Award (MUA). The MUA was also approved by the SECAF in March 2004 and
          is awarded to Air Force units for exceptionally meritorious conduct in performance of outstanding achievement
          or service in direct support of combat operations for at least 90 continuous days during the period of military
          operations against an armed enemy of the United States on or after 11 September 2001. Superior performance
          of normal mission alone will not justify award of the MUA. Service in a combat zone is not required, but
          service must be directly related to the combat effort. The MUA is not awarded to any unit or unit component
          previously awarded the AFOUA, AFOEA, or unit awards from other Service components for the same act,
          achievement, or service.
          15.31.2.3. Air Force Outstanding Unit Award (AFOUA). The AFOUA is awarded only to numbered units or
          numbered Air Forces, air divisions, wings, groups, and squadrons. To be awarded the AFOUA, an organization
          must have performed meritorious service or outstanding achievements that clearly set the unit above and apart
          from similar units. Commanders must annually review the accomplishments of their eligible subordinate units
          and recommend only those units that are truly exceptional. Commanders send AFOUA recommendations to
          their MAJCOMs for consideration. Certain recommendations for the AFOUA are exempt from annual
          submission. These are recommendations for specific achievements, combat operations, or conflict with hostile
          forces.
          15.31.2.4. Air Force Organizational Excellence Award (AFOEA). The AFOEA has the same guidelines and
          approval authority as the AFOUA. It is awarded, however, to unnumbered organizations such as a MAJCOM
          headquarters, an FOA, a DRU, the Office of the Chief of Staff, and other Air Staff and deputy assistant chief of
          staff agencies.
358                                                                                 1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
            15.31.2.5. Joint Meritorious Unit Award (JMUA). The JMUA is awarded in the name of the Secretary of
            Defense to recognize joint units and activities such as a joint task force for meritorious achievement or service
            superior to that normally expected. Air Force members assigned or attached to the joint unit or joint task force
            awarded a JMUA may be eligible to wear the JMUA ribbon.
      15.31.3. Achievement Awards.
            These awards recognize specific types of achievements or milestones while serving in the Regular Air Force or
            as members of the Air Reserve Forces. Air Force members must meet specific eligibility requirements and
            criteria. The career enhancement element determines and verifies eligibility for the various types of
            achievement awards and makes the appropriate entry into personnel records. The career enhancement element
            also procures and provides the initial issue of all achievement medals and ribbons. Additional achievement
            awards can be found in AFI 36-2803.
            15.31.3.1. Air Force Longevity Service Award (AFLSA). The Air Force presents the AFLSA every 4 years to
            members who complete honorable active Federal military service.
            15.31.3.2. Air Force Overseas Ribbon. The Air Force awards these ribbons to individuals who have completed
            an OS (long or short) tour.
            15.31.3.3. Air Force Training Ribbon. The Air Force awards this ribbon to members who have completed an
            Air Force accession training program (since 14 August 1974), such as basic military training (BMT), officer
            training school, ROTC, U.S. Air Force Academy, or medical service.
      15.31.4. Special Trophies and Awards.
            The Air Force also sponsors various special trophies and awards programs. Special trophies and awards are
            unique in that the commanders of MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs must nominate individuals to compete for
            these awards. In most cases, commanders submit nominations annually. The competition among the nominees
            is keen. The commander‘s nomination alone serves as a meaningful recognition because it places the individual
            in competition with the best in the Air Force or the Nation. Some examples of special trophies and awards are
            the 12 Outstanding Airmen of the Year Award and the Lance P. Sijan Award. AFI 36-2805, Special Trophies
            and Awards, lists various special trophies and awards programs.
      15.31.5. Foreign Decorations.
            The policy of the DoD is that awards from foreign governments may be accepted only in recognition of active
            combat service or for outstanding or unusually meritorious performance only upon receiving the approval of
            Department of the Air Force.
15.32. Decorations:
      15.32.1. What Is a Decoration?
            Formal recognition for personal excellence that requires individual nomination and Air Force or DoD approval.
            Decorations are awarded in recognition of acts of exceptional bravery, outstanding achievement, or meritorious
            service. The act or service must place an individual‘s performance high above that of his or her peers and be of
            such importance that the person cannot receive proper recognition in any other way. When an individual is
            being considered for a decoration, the determining factors are duty performance, level of responsibility and
            authority, and the impact of the accomplishment. Each decoration has its own performance requirements for
            award, and an individual may receive only one decoration for any act, achievement, or period of service.
            Specific criteria for each decoration are in AFI 36-2803.
      15.32.2. Recommending an Individual for a Decoration.
            Any person, other than the individual being recommended, having firsthand knowledge of the act, achievement,
            or service may recommend an individual for a decoration. However, this obligation primarily falls on the
            immediate supervisor. The three most common decorations are the Air Force Achievement Medal, the Air
            Force Commendation Medal, and the Meritorious Service Medal. Every unit, wing, and MAJCOM has specific
            submission criteria and procedures for these three decorations. For specific guidance, contact your commander
            support staff or the force management section at the local FSS or military personnel element.
AFPAM36-2241            1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                        359

Section 15I—Airman Promotion System
15.33. Objective.
      The enlisted promotion system supports Department of Defense directive 1304.20, Enlisted Personnel Management
      System (EPMS), by helping to provide a visible, relatively stable career progression opportunity over the long term;
      attracting, retaining, and motivating to career service, the kinds and numbers of people the military services need; and
      ensuring a reasonably uniform application of the principle of equal pay for equal work among the military services.
      This section addresses the program elements of the Regular Air Force Airman.
15.34. Promotion Quotas.
      Promotion quotas for the top five grades (SSgt through CMSgt) are tied to fiscal-end strength and are affected by
      funding limits, regulatory limits, and the number of projected vacancies in specific grades. The DoD limits the number
      of Airmen the Air Force may have in the top five grades. Public law limits the number of Airmen who may serve in
      the Regular Air Force in the grades of SMSgt and CMSgt to 3.5 percent of the enlisted force.
15.35. Promotion Cycles and General Eligibility Requirements.
      The Air Force establishes promotion cycles to ensure timely periodic promotions and to permit more accurate
      forecasting of vacancies. Promotion cycles also balance the promotion administrative workload and provide cutoff
      dates for eligibility. The basis for promotion eligibility is proper skill level, sufficient time in grade (TIG), sufficient
      time in service (TIS), and a recommendation by the immediate commander. Table 15.2 lists TIG, TIS, and significant
      dates of promotion. Table 15.3 lists minimum eligibility requirements for each grade.
15.36. Promotion Ineligibility.
      There are many reasons why an Airman may be considered ineligible for promotion, such as approved retirement,
      declination for extension or reenlistment, court-martial conviction, control roster action, not recommended by the
      commander, failure to appear for scheduled testing without a valid reason, absent without leave, etc. When individuals
      are ineligible for promotion, they cannot test; cannot be considered if already tested; and the projected promotion, if
      already selected, will be cancelled.

15.37. Promotion Sequence Numbers (PSN).
      AFPC assigns PSNs to Airmen selected for promotion to SSgt through CMSgt based on DOR, TAFMSD, and date of
      birth. Supplemental selectees are assigned PSNs of .9 (increment previously announced) or .5 (unannounced future
      increment).
15.38. Accepting Promotion.
      Airmen who accept a promotion are eligible for reassignment and selective retraining in the projected grade. Selectees
      to the grade of MSgt and SMSgt with more than 18 years of TAFMS sign an active duty service commitment (ADSC)
      or statement of understanding within 10 workdays after selections are confirmed acknowledging they must obtain 2
      years of service retainability from the effective date of promotion and incur a 2-year ADSC from the effective date of
      promotion to qualify for nondisability retirement. Selectees to the grade of CMSgt with more than 18 years of TAFMS
      also sign a ADSC or statement of understanding within 10 workdays after selections are confirmed acknowledging
360                                                                                1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
      they must obtain 3 years of service retainability from the effective date of promotion to qualify for nondisability
      retirement.
15.39. Declining Promotion.
      Airmen may decline a promotion in writing any time prior to the effective date. The declination letter must include
      name, social security number, promotion cycle, PSN (if already selected), and a statement of understanding that
      reinstatement will not be authorized.
15.40. Professional Military Education (PME) Completion.
      Airmen selected for promotion to SSgt, MSgt, or SMSgt must complete in-resident PME before assuming these grades
      unless the member is granted an enlisted PME waiver. The Personnel Data System (PDS) automatically withholds
      promotion for those who do not complete appropriate PME prior to the promotion effective date.
15.41. Promotion by Grade:
      15.41.1. Amn and A1C.
              The Air Force normally promotes eligible Airmen recommended by their commander on a noncompetitive
              basis. An AB must have 6 months of TIG to be eligible for promotion to Amn. The TIG requirement for an
              Amn to be eligible for promotion to A1C is 10 months. There are different phase points for individuals
              graduating from BMT as Amn or A1C that correspond with their earlier promotions. Individuals initially
              enlisting for a period of 6 years are promoted from AB or Amn to A1C upon completion of either technical
              training, or 20 weeks of technical training (start date of the 20-week period is the date of BMT completion),
              whichever occurs first.
      15.41.2. SrA.
              The Air Force promotes A1Cs to SrA with either 36 months of TIS and 20 months of TIG or 28 months of TIG,
              whichever occurs first. They must possess a 3-skill level and be recommended by their unit commander. A1Cs
              may compete for early advancement to SrA if they meet the minimum eligibility criteria in Table 15.3. If
              promoted to SrA below the zone (BTZ), their promotion effective date would be 6 months before their fully
              qualified date. Individuals are considered in the month (December, March, June, or September) before the
              quarter (January through March, April through June, July through September, or October through December)
              they are eligible for BTZ promotion.

 Notes:
 1. Use this table to determine standard minimum eligibility requirements for promotion consideration. HQ USAF may
 announce additional eligibility requirements. The individual must serve in the Regular Air Force and have continuous
 active duty as of PECD.
 2. The HYT policy applicable as of PECD may affect promotion eligibility in grades SrA and above.
 3. Use years of satisfactory service for retirement in place of the TAFMSD to determine promotion eligibility for ANG and
 AFR Airmen ordered to Regular Air Force. (Exception: Active Guard Reserve (AGR) or statutory tours.) AFR or ANG
 Airmen are eligible for promotion if extended active duty is on or after PECD.
 4. Airmen First Class must meet skill-level requirements by the effective date of promotion for SrA and by the PECD for
 SSgt. SSgts test and compete for promotion to TSgt if they have a 5-skill level as of PECD; however, they must have a 7-
 skill level before promotion. MSgts and SMSgts must meet minimum skill-level requirements listed above. In some cases,
 commanders may waive this to allow them to compete for promotion. Airmen demoted to SrA and who are past their HYT
 for that grade will have their HYT adjusted based on TIG requirements only. The HYT is adjusted regardless of whether or
 not they are eligible to compete for promotion. The HYT date will be the fourth month after selections are made for the
 first SSgt promotion cycle the Airman is TIG eligible. It is not mandatory that an Airman be considered for promotion if
 ineligible according to AFI 36-2502, Table 1.1.
 5. Service in a commissioned, warrant, or flight officer status is creditable for pay. Such service does not count for this
 requirement (38 Comptroller General 598). You may consider a promotion for Airmen who meet this requirement on the
 first day of the last month promotions are normally made in the cycle. Actual promotion does not occur earlier than the
 first day of the month following the month the Airman completes the required enlisted service. This applies if the selectee
 had a sequence number in an earlier promotion increment; however, if the Airman meets the required enlisted service on
 the first day of the month, the DOR and effective date is that date.
 6. If a TDY student meets the requirements of this table but does not maintain satisfactory proficiency, the MPS that
 services the Airman‘s TDY unit notifies the MPS servicing the Airman‘s unit of assignment.
      15.41.3. SSgt, TSgt, and MSgt.
            Promotion to the grades of SSgt through MSgt occurs under one of two programs: the Weighted Airman
            Promotion System (WAPS) or Stripes for Exceptional Performers (STEP).
            15.41.3.1. WAPS. Airmen compete and test under WAPS in their CAFSC held on the PECD. WAPS consists
            of up to six weighted factors: specialty knowledge test (SKT), promotion fitness examination (PFE), TIS, TIG,
            decorations, and EPRs. Each of these factors is ―weighted‖ or assigned points based on its importance relative
            to promotion. The total number of points possible under WAPS is 460. The PFE and SKT account for 200
            points. The PFE contains a wide range of Air Force knowledge, while the SKT covers AFSC broad technical
            knowledge. Table 15.4 shows how to calculate points. The Air Force makes promotions under WAPS within
            each AFSC, not across them. This means those eligible compete for promotion only with those individuals
            currently working in their AFSC. Selectees are individuals with the highest scores in each AFSC, within the
            quota limitations. If more than one individual has the same total score at the cutoff point, the Air Force
            promotes everyone with that score.

              15.41.3.2. STEP Program. The STEP Program, established in 1980, is designed to meet those unique
              circumstances that, in the commander‘s judgment, clearly warrant promotion. Under STEP, commanders of
              MAJCOMs and FOAs and senior officers in organizations with large enlisted populations may promote a
              limited number of Airmen with exceptional potential to the grades of SSgt through MSgt (each MAJCOM
              determines its own procedures and STEP selection levels). The commander must ensure personnel who are
              promoted meet eligibility requirements including completion of the appropriate PME. An individual may not
              receive more than one promotion under any combination of promotion programs within a 12-month period.
              (Exception: A SrA must serve 6 months of TIG before being promoted to SSgt.) Isolated acts or specific
              achievements should not be the sole basis for promotion under this program. Commanders should guard against
              using STEP as an enlisted BTZ promotion program. Commanders should give WAPS the opportunity to
              promote top performers and incline toward promoting deserving hard-chargers who are behind their peers when
              comparing years of service to the number of stripes they wear. DOR and effective date is the date the selection
              authority announces the promotion.

                         point; drop periods less than 15 days). Example: The last day of the last month of the cycle (31 Jul
                         03 minus TAFMS date (18 Jul 96) equals 7 years 14 days (inclusive dates considered equals 7 x 2 =

                         month of the promotion cycle (count 15 days or more as 1/2 point; drop periods less than 15 days).

 6    EPRs           135 points. Multiply each EPR rating that closed out within 5 years immediately preceding the
                     PECD, not to exceed 10 reports, by the time-weighted factor for that specific report. The time-
                     weighted factor begins with 50 for the most recent report and decreases in increments of five (50-
                     45-40-35-30-25-20-15-10-5) for each report on file. Multiply that product by the EPR conversion
                     factor of 27. Repeat this step for each report. After calculating each report, add the total value of
                     each report for a sum. Divide that sum by the sum of the time-weighted factors added together for
                     the promotion performance factor (126.60). (notes 1 and 3)

 1. Cutoff scores after the second decimal place. Do not use the third decimal place to round up or down.
 2. The decoration closeout date must be on or before the PECD. The ―prepared‖ date of the DECOR 6 recommendation for
 decoration printout must be before the date HQ AFPC made the selections for promotion. Fully document resubmitted
 decorations (downgraded, lost, etc.) and verify they were placed into official channels before the selection date.
 3. Do not count nonevaluated periods of performance, such as break in service, report removed through appeal process,
 etc., in the computation. For example, compute an EPR string of 4B, XB, 5B, 4B the same as 4B, 5B, 4B EPR string.
      15.41.4. SMSgt and CMSgt.
             Consideration for promotion to the grades of SMSgt and CMSgt is a two-phase process. Airmen compete and
             are selected for promotion in the superintendent level (for SMSgt) or the CEM code (for CMSgt) of the CAFSC
             they held as of the PECD. Individuals with a reporting identifier or special duty identifier, designated as their
             CAFSC on the PECD, will compete within that reporting identifier or special duty identifier. Phase I is similar
             to the WAPS evaluation, although some promotion factors differ. Phase II consists of a central evaluation board
             at AFPC using the whole-person concept. These two phases are worth up to 795 points. The Air Force selects
             senior noncommissioned officers (SNCO) with the highest scores in each AFSC for promotion, within the quota
             limitations. If more than one SNCO has the same total score at the cutoff point, the Air Force promotes
             everyone with that score.
15.42. Weighted Airmen Promotion System (WAPS) Testing:
      15.42.1. General Responsibilities and Score Notices.
             Preparing for promotion testing is solely an individual responsibility. WAPS score notices are a means to give
             Airmen a report of their relative standing in the promotion consideration process and should never be provided
             to or used by anyone other than the individual and his or her commander. An Airman‘s scores cannot be
             disclosed without the Airman‘s written consent. Commanders support staff, first sergeants, supervisors, etc., are
             not authorized access to an Airman‘s WAPS scores. The commander has the specific duty to notify Airmen of
             promotion selection or nonselection results and may need to review their score notices to determine status.
             Commanders must restrict their use of the scores to notification and advisory counseling on behalf of the
             Airman and must not allow further dissemination of scores. Individuals may retrieve a copy of their score notice
             on the vMPF after the initial promotion selection for the current cycle.
      15.42.2. Individual Responsibilities.
             Personal involvement is critical. As a minimum, all Airmen testing must:
             15.42.2.1. Know their promotion eligibility status.
             15.42.2.2. Maintain their specialty and military qualifications to retain their eligibility.
             15.42.2.3. Use a self-initiated program of individual study and effort to advance their career under WAPS.
             15.42.2.4. Obtain all current study references for a particular promotion cycle.
             15.42.2.5. Review the annual Enlisted Promotions References and Requirements Catalog (available at
             https://www.omsq.af.mil/) to check availability and receipt of correct study references.
             15.42.2.6. Be prepared to test the first day of the testing window and throughout the testing cycle. Members
             who will be unavailable during the entire testing cycle due to a scheduled TDY must be prepared to test prior to
             TDY departure even if the TDY departure is before the first day of the testing cycle. Airman may opt to test
             early provided the correct test booklets are available.
             15.42.2.7. Ensure they receive at least 60 days of access to study materials prior to testing.
             15.42.2.8. (For SMSgt and CMSgt eligibles) Ensure their selection folder at AFPC is accurate and complete.
364                                                                                   1 OCTOBER 2013           AFPAM36-2241
      15.42.3. Data Verification Record (DVR).
            The MPS will instruct eligible Airmen to obtain and review his or her DVR on vMPF to verify the data used in
            the promotion selection process. Each eligible Airman must review the DVR and the master personnel records
            in the Automated Records Management System (ARMS)/Personnel Records Display Application (PRDA) and
            report any errors to the MPS. If an error is noted, the Airman must immediately contact his or her MPS for
            assistance. The MPS will update Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) with the correct data. Except for
            updating EPR data, each change will produce an updated promotion brief at AFPC and update the DVR on
            vMPF. The Airman‘s receipt of the updated DVR ensures changes were made. Airmen should verify the
            updated information. Supplemental promotion consideration may not be granted if an error or omission
            appeared on the DVR and the individual took no corrective or followup action before the promotion selection
            date for SSgt through MSgt, and before the original evaluation board for SMSgt and CMSgt. Individuals may
            retrieve a copy of their DVR on vMPF before the initial promotion selection for the current cycle.
15.43. Study Materials:
      15.43.1. Enlisted Promotions References and Requirements Catalog (EPRRC).
            Published in August of each year, the EPRRC lists all enlisted promotion tests authorized for administration and
            the study references associated with these tests. There are three types of tests discussed in the catalog;
            promotion fitness examinations (PFE), United States Air Force supervisory examinations (USAFSE), and
            SKTs. The study reference for the PFEs and USAFSEs is AFPAM 36-2241, Professional Development Guide
            (PDG), and the study references for SKTs are career development courses (CDC) and/or technical references.
            For CDCs, the catalog identifies the volume number and publication date only for volumes used to develop the
            SKT. CDCs used as study references may be different from those issued for upgrade training so it is especially
            important to check the EPRRC. For technical references, the catalog primarily lists the short title. The EPRRC
            also contains administrative and special instructions for test control officers. The test cycle number in the
            subject block on the WAPS test notification is the same cycle number that appears in the SKT Study References
            section. The EPRRC is available at https://www.omsq.af.mil/.
      15.43.2. Distribution of WAPS CDCs and Non-CDC Study References.
            The Air Force Career Development Academy (AFCDA) provides each member eligible for promotion a
            personal set of WAPS CDCs. CDCs are automatically processed through the PDS in July and August each year.
            A WAPS CDC order notification printout is sent to each individual when CDCs are processed. Eligible
            members receive an initial set of CDCs during their first year of eligibility and only new or updated material
            each year thereafter. They must promptly contact their unit WAPS monitor if the WAPS CDCs have been made
            available within the time indicated on the WAPS CDC order notification. Electronic copies of CDCs for
            promotion testing purposes are available at https://cdc.aetc.af.mil/. Non-CDC study reference materials, such as
            Air Force instructions or technical orders, should be available on line at http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/.
            Commercial publications, such as medical references, should be available at unit or base level at a ratio of one
            publication for every five eligibles. Individuals may ask the unit WAPS monitor to order any study reference
            listed in the catalog that is not available locally. According to AFI 36-2605, Air Force Military Personnel
            Testing System, members are granted 60 days access to all reference material or they may request a delay in
            testing.
15.44. Promotion Test Development:
      15.44.1. Test Writers.
            The Airman Advancement Division (AAD), Randolph AFB TX, produces all Air Force promotion tests, which
            are literally written by Airmen for Airmen. Although the tests are developed at AAD, SNCOs from field units
            go TDY to Randolph AFB to write the test questions. These SNCO subject-matter experts are selected based on
            their extensive knowledge of, and experience in, their career fields. They provide the technical expertise to
            write their career field‘s SKT, while resident psychologists provide the psychometric expertise required to
            ensure the tests are not only valid, but also as fair as possible to all examinees. All tests are revised annually.
      15.44.2. Test-writing Process.
            AAD personnel work closely with Air Force career field managers to stay abreast of changes affecting career
            fields which may impact test development. At the beginning of a test development project, the tests under
            revision are administered to the subject-matter experts. This gives test writers the point of view of the test takers
            and helps them focus on evaluating how well the test content relates to performance in their specialties. They
            carefully check the references of each question. Only after this is accomplished do they begin writing new test
AFPAM36-2241        1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                           365

            questions. Every question on a test comes from one of the publications appearing on the study reference list
            published in the EPRRC. The answer to every single question on a particular PFE, USAFSE, or SKT can be
            found in one of the publications on the study reference list for that test. If a document does not appear on the
            study reference list, it is not used as a test reference.
      15.44.3. SKTs.
            SKTs measure knowledge important to job performance of SSgts, TSgts, and MSgts in a particular specialty.
            SNCOs from each career field write tests for their AFS using the specific career field education and training
            plan, occupational analysis data, and their experiences to tie test content to important tasks performed in the
            specialty.
      15.44.4. PFE and USAFSE.
            The PFE measures the military and supervisory knowledge required of SSgts, TSgts, and MSgts. The USAFSE
            evaluates practical military, supervisory, and managerial knowledge required in the top two NCO grades.
            CMSgts from across the Air Force write these tests using their experience and MKTS survey data to develop
            relevant tests.
15.45. Promotion Test Administration and Scoring.
      Promotion tests are administered to all Airmen competing for promotion to the grades of SSgt through CMSgt. To the
      greatest extent possible, test administration procedures are standardized to ensure fairness for all members competing
      for promotion. Strict procedures are used for handling, storing, and transmitting test booklets and answer sheets to
      preclude the possibility of loss or compromise. All promotion tests are electronically scored at AFPC following
      thorough quality control steps to ensure accurate test results for each member. The test scanning and scoring process
      contains many safeguards to verify accuracy, including hand-scoring a percentage of answer sheets (pulled randomly),
      and physically reviewing answer sheets. Because of the difficulty of the tests, some individuals may receive scores
      they believe do not reflect their study efforts. Likewise, some members may receive the same score as the previous
      year. Information concerning verification of test scores is contained in AFI 36-2605.
15.46. Air Force Enlisted Promotion Test Compromise.
      Group study (two or more people) is strictly prohibited. This prohibition protects the integrity of the promotion testing
      program by ensuring promotion test scores are a reflection of each member‘s individual knowledge. Enlisted personnel
      who violate these prohibitions are subject to prosecution under Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice
      (UCMJ) for violating a lawful general regulation. Conviction can result in a dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all
      pay and allowances, and confinement for up to 2 years. Information concerning enlisted promotion test compromise is
      contained in AFI 36-2605. In addition to group study, specific test compromise situations include, but are not limited
      to:
      15.46.1. Discussing the contents of an SKT, PFE, or USAFSE with anyone other than the test control officer or test
      examiner. Written inquiries or complaints about a test are processed through the test control officer.
      15.46.2. Sharing pretests or lists of test questions recalled from a current or previous SKT, PFE, or USAFSE; personal
      study materials; underlined or highlighted study reference material; and commercial study guides with other
      individuals.
      15.46.3. Although the Air Force does not recommend or support commercial study guides, they may be used to
      prepare for promotion testing. Placing commercial study guide software on government computers is prohibited
      because doing so implies Air Force sanctioning of the guides. Additionally, there are prohibitions against developing
      commercial study guides. However, Airmen are encouraged to use the Air Force sanctioned exercises available at
      http://pdg.af.edu to complement their self-study for promotion testing.
      15.46.4. Creating, storing, or transferring personal study notes on government computers. Government computers may
      be used to view electronic versions of official study references such as this pamphlet, Air Force instructions, Air Force
      policy directives, technical orders, etc.
      Note: Training designed to improve general military knowledge, such as NCO of the quarter or SrA BTZ boards, does
      not constitute group study as long as the intent of the training is not to study for promotion tests. Likewise, training to
      improve general study habits or test-taking skills is permissible if the training does not focus on preparing for
      promotion tests. However, individuals may not collaborate in any way or at any time to prepare for promotion testing.

15.47. Supplemental Promotion Actions.
      AFPC conducts in-system promotion consideration as needed after the initial promotion selection and announces
      supplemental selection board dates for eligible Airmen. Remember, supplemental promotion consideration may not be
      granted if the error or omission appeared on the DVR, in ARMS/PRDA, or in the senior NCO selection record and the
      individual did not take the necessary steps to correct it prior to promotion selection or prior to the evaluation board.
      Fully documented supplemental consideration requests are submitted to the MPS in writing with the recommendation
      of the individual‘s unit commander. The MPS forwards the request to AFPC for final approval.
15.48. Occupational Analysis (OA) Program.
      15.48.1. According to AFI 36-2623, Occupational Analysis, the AETC/A2/3/10 Occupational Analysis Division
      surveys incumbents of military and civilian occupational specialties to provide personnel and training decisionmakers
      with factual and objective job information which enables them to justify and/or change personnel policies and
      programs, refine and maintain occupational structures, and establish, validate, and adjust testing and training
      programs. The Occupational analysis process identifies the work performed in the field by surveying 100 percent of
      eligible career field members. Most enlisted specialties have an occupational analysis conducted on them every 2 to 3
      years.
      15.48.2. Occupational analysis results directly impact your career because of their use in developing the questions in
      SKTs and in determining what goes into CFETPs.
      15.48.3. When you receive a tasking from the Occupational analysis Division to complete a Web-based survey on the
      tasks you perform in your job, realize that your dutiful and timely input to the survey is critical to ensuring promotion
      test content and technical training are directly linked to the duties and tasks your career field performs. Your
      investment of 1 to 2 hours in the completion of these occupational surveys can reap huge benefits to ensuring the
      accuracy and timely development of the enlisted workforce.
      15.48.4. You can actually view the tasks that your career field is performing. Simply go to http://oa.aetc.af.mil/, select
      ―Enlisted Products‖, and find your specialty‘s occupational analysis report to gain valuable insights into the duties and
      responsibilities of your career field.

Chapter 15 ends here for those testing to
SSgt, TSgt, or MSgt.
If testing to SMSgt or CMSgt, continue
studying this chapter (Section 15J).
368                                                                                  1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
Section 15J—SNCO Promotion Program
15.49. Individual Responsibility:
      15.49.1. The importance of individual responsibility cannot be overemphasized. Each individual is responsible for
      ensuring he or she is properly identified as eligible for promotion consideration. (See AFI 36-2502, Table 2.1, for
      minimum eligibility requirements for promotion.) Those eligible should have the current study reference materials,
      know when the testing cycle starts, ensure the information in their selection folder at AFPC is accurate and complete,
      study as needed, and test when scheduled.
      15.49.2. Those eligible for promotion to SMSgt and CMSgt should obtain their DVR (Figure 15.3) through vMPF.
      The DVR displays current career information as of the PECD, some of which is included in the Senior NCO
      Evaluation Brief (Figure 15.4) reviewed by the evaluation board.
      15.49.3. Along with reviewing the DVR, eligibles should review their documents filed in ARMS and PRDA and the
      SNCO selection folder to ensure data is accurate and appropriate documents are filed. Eligibles should notify their
      MPS of any errors. A copy of the SNCO selection folder may be obtained from AFPC by email request.
15.50. Promotion Criteria:
      15.50.1. Table 15.5 shows how to calculate weighted factors for SMSgt and CMSgt promotions. Table 15.3 shows the
      minimum eligibility requirements for promotion to SMSgt and CMSgt.
      15.50.2. SMSgts being considered for promotion to CMSgt will compete for promotion in the CEM code of the
      CAFSC they held as of the PECD. MSgts being considered for promotion to SMSgt will compete for promotion in the
      superintendent level of the CAFSC they held as of the PECD.
      15.50.3. The board considers academic education completed on or before the PECD. Up to three academic education
      levels can be reflected on the SNCO evaluation brief. When the academic education level is updated in the PDS, the
      promotion file is updated and a new DVR and evaluation brief is produced to reflect the change. If the Community
      College of the Air Force or any other accredited college requirements were completed before the PECD but the
      evaluation brief was completed within 10 days of the board convening date, the education services office will update
      the PDS and notify AFPC by message with an information copy to the individual‘s MPS. This information is then used
      to post the senior NCO evaluation brief filed in the SNCO selection folder. Eligible Airmen are responsible for
      ensuring this data is posted on their DVR and evaluation brief.
      15.50.4. The PECD is used to determine content of the selection folder and information on promotion evaluation
      briefs. The number of EPRs included is limited to those reports closed out 10 years before the PECD (maximum of 15
      EPRs). However, only the last 5 years (maximum of 10 EPRs) are used to compute the EPR weighted factor score.
      Approved decorations, resubmissions, or decorations being upgraded must be submitted and placed into official
      channels before the selection date. The data shown on the senior NCO evaluation brief includes the member‘s name,
      social security number, grade, DOR, Air Force specialty information, service dates (to include projected retirement
      date), academic education level, decorations, duty information, duty history, and PME/CCAF completion.
15.51. Evaluation Board.
      The evaluation board is very important because it accounts for over half the total score. Understanding how board
      members are selected, the evaluation board process, and those areas considered by board members can provide
      valuable insight into what it takes to get promoted.
      15.51.1. Selection of Board Members.
            The number of eligible personnel identified by MAJCOM and AFSCs determines the number and career field
            backgrounds of the board members. Board members are divided into panels, each consisting of one colonel and
            two CMSgts. The board president is always a general officer. Before evaluating records, board members are
            briefed on the task objective, eligible population profile, and selection folder content. Board members are then
            sworn to complete the board‘s task without prejudice or partiality. They also participate in an extensive trial-run
            process to ensure scoring consistency before evaluating any ―live‖ records.
      15.51.2. Areas the Board Considers.
            The board looks at performance, education, breadth of experience, job responsibility, professional competence,
            specific achievements, and leadership. In each area, the individual has control over the information the board
            reviews. Individuals therefore—not board members—are responsible for their own promotions by ensuring the
            board receives the most current updates.
AFPAM36-2241             1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                                               369

The following data is reflected in your Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS) Record. The data reflected is as of the Promotion Eligibility Cutoff
Date (PECD) and may not be the same as what is in the Military Personnel Data System (MILPDS).
The information reflected on this DVR will be used in the promotion process for the cycle indicated. Review this data in detail, especially your CAFSC,
decorations, PME and education data and retain for your personal records. Information reflected is as of Promotion Eligibility Cutoff Date (PECD), except a
projected retirement date will continue to be updated until the actual promotion brief is produced (about 30-45 days prior to the board). For the weighted
portion of your score, only performance reports for 5 years (max of 10) that closeout on or before the PECD are used. The evaluation board reviews all
reports closing out up to 10 years prior to PECD. Any additional reports are listed for your information only. If you have recently retrained or entered a
Special Duty Identifier, your CAFSC effective date is the date you departed for training. If you detect any errors or have any questions, contact your
customer service center or personnel representative immediately. Your personal involvement is a must—it‘s your promotion
This is considered an official document and it is your responsibility to verify your promotion information.

            15.51.2.1. Performance. The evaluation board reviews all EPRs for the 10 years preceding the PECD. The
            board members consider all aspects of the EPR—job description (key duties, tasks, and responsibilities),
            individual rating factors, periods of supervision, overall evaluations, levels of endorsements, and each narrative
            word picture. If the person is a strong performer, the EPRs should convey to the board that he or she has
            demonstrated the highest qualities required of a leader and manager.
            15.51.2.2. Education. Although the Air Force does not require enlisted members to have any education beyond
            high school, many enlisted members are pursuing postsecondary education. When considering educational
            opportunities, enlisted members should focus on a degree program that complements their career field and
            enhances their ability to do their job. When the board evaluates academic education as part of the whole-person
            assessment, the most important consideration should be the degree to which the education enhances the NCO‘s
            potential to serve in the next higher grade.
            15.51.2.3. Breadth of Experience. This factor refers to the individual‘s overall professional background,
            experience, and knowledge gained during his or her career to the present. Board members consider knowledge
            and practical experience in areas other than the current AFSC. If the eligible individual remained in one career
            field, board members consider whether he or she had wide exposure across the career field. Board members also
            consider potential to fill other types of jobs, as well as supervisory and managerial experience.
            15.51.2.4. Job Responsibility. This factor does not refer entirely to the career field‘s command-level positions,
            although experience at this level is a consideration. Many base-level jobs demand just as much of an individual
            as jobs at higher command levels. Consideration is primarily given to what was asked of the individual and how
            well the individual accomplished the task. Did the job require significant decisions, or was it a job in which the
            individual routinely carried out the decisions of others? Is the individual a proven, effective manager,
            responsible for directing the work of others, or is the person responsible only for his or her own performance?
            15.51.2.5. Professional Competence. What do rating and endorsing officials say about the individual‘s
            expertise? Is it truly outstanding? How much does the individual know about the job, and how well does he or
            she accomplish it? The Air Force Chief of Staff has emphasized the need for careful selection of individuals for
            promotion to the top two NCO grades. Therefore, those selected must be the best qualified. They must have
            sufficient leadership and managerial experience to prepare them for the challenges they, and the Air Force, face.
            15.51.2.6. Specific Achievements. These are often recognized in the form of awards and decorations. However,
            many other significant accomplishments are often addressed in the EPR‘s narrative comments. Such
            recognition, either in the form of decorations or narrative comments, can help board members identify the truly
            outstanding performer.
            15.51.2.7. Leadership. Board members use their judgment, expertise, and maturity when reviewing records to
            assess a SNCO‘s potential to serve in a higher grade. In particular, board members evaluate leadership potential.
            How well does he or she manage, lead, and interact with peers and subordinates? What have rating officials said
            about the person‘s leadership qualities and potential? What haven‘t they said?
15.52. Evaluation Process:
      15.52.1. Trial Run.
            As previously mentioned, board members are given two selected sets of records to score as a practice exercise
            before the actual scoring process. Using the whole-person concept, they score the records using secret ballots.
            This process helps establish a scoring standard they can apply consistently throughout the board process.
      15.52.2. Scoring:
            15.52.2.1. After the trial run is completed and discussed, panels begin the actual scoring of live records. The
            same panel evaluates all eligibles competing in a CEM code or AFSC. Each panel member scores each record,
            using a 6- to 10-point scale and half-point increments. An individual‘s record may receive a panel composite
            score (3 members) from a minimum of 18 (6-6-6) to a maximum of 30 (10-10-10) points. The composite score
            (18 to 30 points) is later multiplied by a factor of 15, resulting in a total board score (270 to 450). Using a secret
            ballot, panel members score the record individually with no discussion. Records are given to each panel
            member, and after they are scored, the ballots are given directly to a recorder. This ensures each panel member
            has scored each record independently.
            15.52.2.2. A record scored with a difference of more than 1 point between any of the panel members (for
            example, 8.5, 8.0, and 7.0) is termed a split vote and is returned to the panel for resolution. At this point, all
            panel members may discuss the record openly among themselves. This allows them to state why they scored the
372                                                                                   1 OCTOBER 2013           AFPAM36-2241
            record as they did. Only those panel members directly involved in the split may change their scores. If panel
            members cannot come to an agreement on the split vote, they give the record to the board president for
            resolution. This ensures consistency of scoring and eliminates the possibility that one panel member will have a
            major impact (positive or negative) on an individual‘s board score.
            15.52.2.3. Actual scores will vary between panels; the specific reason why certain panels scored the way they
            did cannot be determined because this is a subjective decision. However, because a single panel reviews each
            CEM code or AFSC, all records within a CEM code or AFSC are evaluated under the same standard. Some
            panels may award high scores, while others may award low ones. Therefore, whether a panel scores ―easy‖ or
            ―hard‖ is not significant. The important part of the final board score is how one eligible compares to his or her
            peers in the final order of merit. This allows each eligible to see how competitive he or she was.
            15.52.2.4. Because each board is completely independent, board members do not know how an individual
            scored or ranked during the previous cycle. Each board arrives at its own scoring standard. However, as long as
            everyone competing in a CEM code or AFSC is looked at under the same standard, fair and equitable
            consideration is ensured. A number of factors affect board scores from year to year—new panel members with
            different thought processes, previous eligible with changed or improved records, and a large pool of new
            eligibles. As a result, board scores do vary (often significantly) from one board to the next.
            15.52.2.5. Board members do not have access to the weighted scores of individuals competing for promotion.
            Their primary concern is to align all eligible in a relative order of merit, based on their panel score, within their
            CEM code or AFSC. When board members leave, they do not know who was selected. They only know they
            have reviewed and scored each record within the standard that evolved from the trial run.
      15.52.3. Not Fully Qualified (NFQ) Process:
            15.52.3.1. A process associated with enlisted promotion boards often misunderstood is the NFQ process. As
            previously stated, SNCO Evaluation Board members use the whole-person concept to align eligible SNCOs in a
            relative order of merit within their CEM code or AFSC based on the quality of each eligible‘s SNCO evaluation
            record. Also, board members are formally charged to ensure individuals are not only best qualified, but also
            fully qualified to assume the responsibility of the next higher grade.
            15.52.3.2. If the board determines an individual is NFQ based on an evaluation of the record, the individual is
            rendered NFQ for promotion. In this case, AFPC removes the individual from promotion consideration and
            deactivates his or her promotion record, rendering the individual ineligible for promotion. The parent MAJCOM
            and MPS are then notified of the board‘s decision in writing. The parent MAJCOM must immediately notify the
            individual through the unit commander. The board is not allowed to disclose the exact rationale for its findings.
            However, factors contributing to the decision can be as general as an overall noncompetitive record when
            compared to peers or as specific as a demonstrated substandard performance and disciplinary problems.
            Additionally, the CEM may have a very small number of eligibles and the board has exercised the authority to
            prevent promotion by default. In any event, the member is ineligible for that cycle.
      15.52.4. Post-Board Processing.
            After the board is finished, the weighted factor scores are combined with the board scores. This completely
            electronic operation builds an order of merit listing by total score within each CEM code or AFSC, and the
            overall promotion quota is then applied to each list. After the selection results are approved, the data is
            transmitted to the MPS. Questions regarding the SMSgt and CMSgt promotion selection process should be
            directed to the MPS career development element.
      15.52.5. Score Notice.
            All eligible personnel receive a score notice that reports how they compare to their peers in their CEM code or
            AFSC in the specific promotion cycle. To determine weak areas, individuals can also compare their scores with
            the promotion statistics available in the MPS and/or posted on the Internet via the vMPF. Personnel can access
            the vMPF through the AFPC Web site at http://w11.afpc.randolph.af.mil/vs/.

                        (not to exceed 10 reports) by the time-weighted factor for that specific report. The time- weighted
                        factor begins with 50 for the most recent report and decreases in increments of 5 (50-45-40-35-30-25-
                        20-15-10-5) for each report on file. Multiply that product by the EPR conversion factor of 27. Repeat
                        this step for each report. After calculating each report, add the total value of each report for a sum.
                        Divide that sum by the sum of the time-weighted factors added together for the promotion
                        performance factor; for example, 126.60 (notes 1 and 3).

                        Example: EPR string (most recent to oldest): 5B-4B-5B-5B-5B-4B
                        5 x 50 = 250 x 27 = 6,750
                        4 x 45 = 180 x 27 = 4,860
                        5 x 40 = 200 x 27 = 5,400         28,485 ÷ 225 = 126.60
                        5 x 35 = 175 x 27 = 4,725
                        5 x 30 = 150 x 27 = 4,050
                        4 x 25 = 100 x 27 = 2,700

 Notes:
 1. Cut off scores after the second decimal place. Do not use the third decimal place to round up or down.
 2. The decoration closeout date must be on or before the PECD. The ―prepared‖ date of the DECOR 6, Recommendation for
 Decoration Printout, must be before the date AFPC made the selections for promotion. Fully document resubmitted
 decorations (downgraded, lost, etc.) and verify they were placed into official channels before the selection date.
 3. Do not count nonevaluated periods of performance (break in service, report removed through appeal process, etc.) in the
 computation. For example, compute an EPR string of 4B, XB, 5B, 4B the same as an EPR string of 4B, 5B, 4B.

15.53. Supplemental Promotion Actions:
       15.53.1. Reviewing the DVR and SNCO selection folder and taking prompt action to correct any errors provides the
       evaluation board the most accurate career assessment. However, if data errors or omissions occur, supplemental
       promotion consideration may be granted. Supplemental consideration is not granted if the error or omission appeared
       on the DVR or in the ARMS/PRDA and appropriate corrective and follow-up action was not taken before the board
       met.
       15.53.2. Table 15.6 provides specific information concerning supplemental consideration. Requests for supplemental
       consideration are submitted in writing containing the unit commander‘s recommendation and processed through the
       MPS. In addition, the MPS can answer questions about the DVR, which may eliminate the need for supplemental
       consideration.

 Notes:
 1. Do not allow supplemental consideration for Airmen needing more than the maximum board score (450 points) for
 selection.
 2. Give credit if the Airman takes the end-of-course (EOC) examination on or before the PECD and successfully
 completes the course, even if this EOC examination is not scored until after the PECD. The MilPDS will not change; only
 the individual‘s promotion record. Note: Effective cycles 95E9 to 98E9/97E8 to 98E8, PME was masked on the Senior
 NCO Evaluation Brief and WAPS points were not awarded.
 3. Prior to rescoring the record, panel members consider the type of error, degree of impact on the promotion score, and
 the points needed for selection. Records the panel considers, but chooses not to rescore, are nonselectees.

Section 15K—Manpower Management
15.54. Keeping Unit Manpower Documents Current.
     Work center supervisors should periodically review their Unit Manpower Document (UMD) to ensure it accurately
     reflects unit requirements. The UMD displays current and projected requirements and can be configured to display
     desired fields in various formats. Unit commanders and supervisors may request a UMD from the installation
     manpower and organization section on an as-needed basis. Typically, the unit manpower point of contact serves as the
     liaison between the unit and manpower and organization section; thus, work center supervisors should coordinate any
     UMD changes, etc., with their unit manpower POC.
15.55. Funded and Unfunded Requirements and the Enlisted Grades Allocation Program:
     15.55.1. The terms ―manpower requirement‖ and ―manpower authorization‖ are often misunderstood. A manpower
     requirement is a statement of manpower needed to accomplish a job, workload, mission, or program. The two types of
     manpower requirements are: funded and unfunded. Funded manpower requirements are those that have been validated
     and allocated. Funded manpower requirements are also known as authorizations. Unfunded requirements are validated
     manpower needs that are deferred because of budgetary constraints.
     15.55.2. Some actions not only affect authorization levels but can also impact funded grades. The Enlisted Grades
     Allocation Program is designed to ensure enlisted grades are equitably allocated to HQ USAF, MAJCOMs, FOAs, and
     DRUs, and at the same time to ensure constraints are met. A grade imbalance between what is required and what is
     funded (authorized) can occur as a result of legislative and budgetary constraints on the allocated grades. For example,
     CMSgts are congressionally constrained to 1 percent of the total enlisted force.
     15.55.3. HQ USAF implements congressional and DoD grade constraints by creating grade factors. Two types of
     factors created and distributed are: (1) overall command grade factors for each enlisted grade, and (2) career
     progression group factors for each AFSC to the first three digits. Command grade factors ensure authorized grades do
     not exceed command-ceiling constraints. The career progression group factors ensure equitable allocation of the
     grades within each AFSC in each command. Both types of factors are applied to the budgeted end-strength. Air Force
     career field managers can recommend adjustments to AF/A1M. When making adjustments, they must maintain a zero
     balance of total grades allocated for each command.
15.56. Initiating and Tracking Manpower Changes:
     15.56.1. Periodically, a unit may need to change an existing requirement on the UMD. An authorization change
     request (ACR) is used to request this change. The unit point of contact identifies the requested change and provides
     detailed justification to the servicing manpower and organization section. The manpower and organization section
     evaluates the request, enters it into the MPES, and makes a recommendation for approval or disapproval to the
     MAJCOM.
     15.56.2. Many actions necessitate an ACR. Some of the most frequent are AFSC changes, position realignments,
     redistribution of funding from a funded requirement to an unfunded requirement, and grade conversions. Many factors
     must be considered when a unit proposes a change. Common considerations include: (1) determining how the change
     affects the organizational structure, (2) ensuring the manpower realignment does not exceed the requirements allowed
     by Air Force manpower standards, (3) ensuring the requested change does not cross program elements, and (4)
     ensuring the requested change does not adversely impact the unit‘s ability to deploy or perform its wartime mission.
     15.56.3. Changes to the UMD must be processed within resource constraints minus no net increase in resources,
     grades, etc. For example, if a unit wants to fund a position that is currently unfunded, a funded position must be
     identified for conversion to unfunded and detailed rationale for the change provided. The servicing Manpower and
     Organization Section will work closely with the unit POC when developing an ACR. Unit commander approval of
     ACR actions is required prior to submission of the ACR to the MAJCOM POCs with the exception of actions resulting
     from a public-private competition or in-sourcing initiative.
     15.56.4. Approved changes to the UMD are reflected by an authorization change notice (ACN) generated by the
     MPES. The ACN provides details of the approved change and the rationale for the change. The manpower and
     organization section will, in turn, provide a copy of the ACN to the affected unit‘s point of contact. If the request is
     disapproved, the MAJCOM provides rationale to the submitting unit through the servicing manpower and organization
     section.

15.57. Manpower and Organization Section.
      The installation manpower and organization section performs a variety of functions to help effectively manage
      manpower resources. The core competencies of the manpower and organization section encompass organization
      structure, requirement determination, program allocation and control, and performance management. Personnel within
      the manpower and organization section provide day-to-day manpower resource management services to include UMD
      management, assisting with ACRs, ACNs, and organizational structure changes. Manpower and organization section
      personnel also provide other management services, such as performance management, commercial activity services,
      Performance Enhancement Capital Investment Program services, Innovative Development through Employee
      Awareness (IDEA) Program management, and consulting services.

Section 15L—Commercial Services Management (CSM)
15.58. Purpose.
      CSM is a program designed to improve functions using a variety of management tools including competitive sourcing
      (CS), in-sourcing (IS), business process reengineering (BPR), and post-competition accountability. The three principal
      goals of CSM are to sustain readiness, improve performance and quality by doing business more efficiently and cost
      effectively, and focus available personnel and resources on core Air Force missions. CSM will not affect military-
      essential skills or those functions that are inherently governmental.
      15.58.1. Military Essential Skills. Military Essential skills are defined as skills that:
            15.58.1.1. Directly contribute to the prosecution of war (combat or direct combat support).
            15.58.1.2. Exercise UCMJ authority.
            15.58.1.3. By law must be filled with military personnel.
            15.58.1.4. Are military by custom or tradition (for example, bands and honor guards).
            15.58.1.5. Are needed to support overseas rotations and to sustain certain career fields.
            15.58.1.6. Are not available in the private sector.
      15.58.2. Inherently Governmental Function.
            The Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act of 1998 defines an inherently governmental function as one that is
            so intimately related to the public interest as to require performance by federal government employees.
            Functions may include the determination of budget policy, guidance, and strategy; the determination of the
            content and application of policies and regulations; the selection of individuals for federal government
            employment; and obligating money on behalf of the government. For example, warranted contracting officers
            are inherently governmental because they are responsible for making decisions on behalf of the government.
            They are the signature authority for committing government funds. The entire contracting staff, however, does
            not necessarily satisfy the same criteria. Contracting personnel who research and provide information, advice,
            etc., to the warranted contracting officers do not necessarily have to be government personnel.
15.59. Competitive Sourcing Process.
      The Office of Management and Budget‘s Circular (OMBC) A-76, Performance of Commercial Activities, and AFI 38-
      203, Commercial Activities Program, define a structured process for determining whether to perform work in-house or
      through contract.
      15.59.1. Competitive Sourcing Study:
            15.59.1.1. A competitive sourcing study is a public-private competition that compares the total cost of the in-
            house government operation of an activity to the total cost of a private sector to perform the same activity. The
            study results determine whether a commercial activity can be done more economically and efficiently by
            contract or by an in-house workforce.
            15.59.1.2. During the competitive sourcing study, the in-house government operation is reengineered into a
            most efficient organization and submitted in the competition as the ―agency‘s tender‖ which is the
            government‘s proposal for how it will perform the work. The process of developing a most efficient
            organization emphasizes innovation in meeting the requirements laid out in the solicitation for the work being
            completed. The most efficient organization is allowed latitude in its organization and processes outside of the
            standard Air Force structure to enable greater efficiency and effectiveness.
AFPAM36-2241          1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                       377

      15.59.2. Competitive Sourcing Impact:
            15.59.2.1. Air Force policy is to minimize both the adverse effects on personnel and the disruption to the
            affected organizations. Adversely affected personnel are provided the ―right of first refusal‖ for contractor jobs,
            for which they are qualified, in the event the government is unable to place them in other federal positions.
            15.59.2.2. Competitive sourcing generates savings by finding more efficient ways to accomplish a particular
            function. A competitive sourcing study also frees up military personnel to perform other core military essential
            activities. In a competitive sourcing study, the mission remains essentially unchanged; it is the composition of
            the workforce that changes. Where ―blue suiters‖ were initially performing the mission, the resulting service
            provider will be made up of either civil servants or private sector contract employees.
15.60. In-sourcing:
      15.60.1. Origin and Authorization.
            15.60.1.1. In-sourcing is the conversion of a contracted function to DoD civilian or military performance, or any
            combination thereof. Although OMBC A-76 provides a structured process for converting contracts to in-house
            performance through public-private competition, 10 U.S.C. Section 2463, Guidelines and Procedures for Use of
            Civilian Employees to Perform Department of Defense Functions, permits DoD components to convert
            contracts without applying the Circular‘s requirements. 10 U.S.C. Section 2463 provides for special
            consideration to using DoD civilian employees to perform any function that is currently performed by a
            contractor and meets any of the following criteria:
            15.60.1.1.1. Has been performed by Department of Defense civilian employees at any time during the previous
            10 years.
            15.60.1.1.2. Is closely associated with the performance of an inherently governmental function.
            15.60.1.1.3. Has been performed pursuant to a contract awarded on a noncompetitive basis.
            15.60.1.1.4. Has been determined by a contracting officer to have been performed poorly during the 5 years
            preceding the date of such determination, because of excessive costs or inferior quality.
            15.60.1.2. Furthermore, in accordance with the Deputy Secretary of Defense memorandum, In-sourcing
            Contracted Services-Implementation Guidance, contracted functions found to be inherently governmental,
            exempt from contract performance, unauthorized personal services, or experiencing problems associated with
            contract administration shall be in-sourced regardless of cost.

            15.60.2.1. An IS BCA compares the cost of a contracted function to the cost of DoD civilian employees to
            perform the same activity. The BCA justifies the decision to in-source when based on cost. Included in the BCA
            are certifications validating contract cost, in-house manning and grades, and available labor pool. Installations
            and MAJCOMs develop BCAs, and AFMA validates BCAs as part of the AF IS approval process. Cost models
            are built using DTM-COMPARE, an AFMA-provided tool that incorporates guidance and factors described
            under the current National Defense Authorization Act and OSD‘s directive-type memorandum (DTM) 09-007,
            ―Estimating and Comparing the Full Costs of Civilian and Military Manpower and Contract Support.‖
            15.60.2.2. If new or expanded requirements or functions performed under contract are determined to be
            inherently governmental or exempt from private sector performance for reasons stated in DoDI 1100.22, Policy
            and Procedures for Determining Workforce Mix, the functions shall be converted to government performance
            without an economic analysis. In all other cases a cost comparison is required and serves as the key component
            of the BCA.
15.61. Business Process Reengineering (BPR):
      15.61.1. BPR Blended Approach.
            Business Process Reengineering (BPR) applies a blended approach of management engineering methods and
            Air Force Smart Operations for the 21st Century (AFSO21) process improvement techniques to work centers to
            determine the most efficient allocation of resources to satisfy the workload requirement. BPR affects
            organizations at all levels from the unit commander to the Air Force functional manager. More broadly, the Air
            Force as a whole benefits from freeing resources from inefficient or unnecessary processes. Such resources can
            be reallocated to address under-sourced critical missions.
378                                                                                1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
      15.61.2. BPR Rapid Improvement Event (RIE).
             The RIE is a short-term, high intensity effort to address a specific work center problem. The duration is
             typically a week though the preparation normally begins several weeks beforehand with follow-up continuing
             thereafter. An RIE is also called by other names, including rapid improvement workshop, Kaizen event, Kaizen
             blitz, and accelerated improvement workshop. Some tools facilitators use during an RIE include root cause
             analysis, flowcharts, affinity diagrams, brainstorming, nominal group technique, and Gantt charts. The RIE is
             one of many management engineering methods and AFSO21 process improvement techniques used to support
             BPR. BPRs are effective in improving operations for functions that are not candidates for competitive sourcing
             studies.
15.62. Post Competition Accountability.
      Post competition accountability uses a three-piece blended approach to ensure government organizations provide
      proper oversight and management of in-house most efficient organizations: onsite management controls through a
      quality assurance surveillance program; tracking execution of public-private competitions and high performing
      organizations through the DoD Commercial Activities Management Information System (DCAMIS), which monitors
      cost and performance of resulting service provider through final performance period; and through higher headquarters
      staff assistance visits.
15.63. Responsibilities.
      AF/A1M is responsible for implementing the Air Force CSM program. Air Force Manpower Agency (AFMA)
      develops and maintains tools, templates, and guidebooks to enable the field to execute the program, administers the
      inherently governmental/commercial activities inventory, monitors post competition accountability, and provides field
      support on CSM initiatives. MAJCOM A1M is the manpower function responsible for providing CSM oversight at
      command levels and providing guidance to manpower and organization sections for implementation of the CSM
      program at the respective wings.

Section 15M—Civilian Personnel Management and Programs
15.64. Civilian Personnel Services.
      The Air Force provides most civilian personnel services from two sources: installation civilian personnel sections
      (CPS), usually located in the FSS, and AFPC. Interim civilian personnel centers in Air Force Materiel Command, U.S.
      Air Forces in Europe, and the 11th Wing will transition to the CPS-AFPC model in the next few years.
15.65. Civilian Resource Management:
      15.65.1. While military pay is centrally managed by HQ USAF, civilian pay is a budget line item at MAJCOM, FOA,
      and installation level, as well as at HQ USAF. The availability of performance payout and numbers of authorized
      civilian positions comprise the base line for civilian employment levels. Funds are also needed for civilian overtime;
      performance awards; retention, recruitment, and relocation bonuses; seasonal and longer-term overhires; and voluntary
      separation incentive payments to minimize involuntary reduction-in-force (RIF) separations.
      15.65.2. Civilian resource management is a team effort. Commanders and senior leaders depend on human resource
      officers, financial managers, and manpower officers to recommend effective use of employees, funds, and manpower
      authorizations to meet mission requirements. AFPC has a subsystem on its Web site called Personnel Management
      Information Support System (PERMISS), designed specifically for supervisors. MAJCOMs and installations use a
      board structure, meeting at least quarterly, to manage annual appropriations, revolving funds, or reimbursements used
      for civilian employment costs.
      15.65.3. When funds are available, civilian overhire positions can be established to handle peak workloads, military
      manning shortfalls, and contractor defaults or other short-notice requirements that cannot be met through normal
      manpower requirements or personnel assignment processes. Most overhire positions are filled using temporary
      appointments (not to exceed 1 year). If the workload continues beyond a year, term appointments of up to 6 years may
      be used. Permanent appointments to overhire positions are unusual, although a permanent employee may be placed in
      an overhire position in a RIF.
15.66. Job Descriptions:
      15.66.1. Civilian employees, except those above grade General Schedule (GS)-15 do not have a rank. Instead, they
      take the grade of the position they occupy. Since the position is graded, not the employee, detailed written job
      descriptions are the basis for determining pay, qualification requirements, performance expectations, and appraisal
      ratings.
AFPAM36-2241           1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                        379

      15.66.2. Position descriptions historically have covered duties, responsibilities, and supervisory controls. The Air
      Force has expanded the scope of core personnel documents (CPD) to include performance standards, qualifications
      required for recruitment, and training requirements for a new employee in the position.
      15.66.3. Supervisors are responsible for CPD accuracy, and for implementing standard core personnel documents
      (SCPD) from a growing library of these documents. AFPC/DPIC (formally AFMA/MAH) coordinates SCPD content
      with appropriate HQ USAF functional representatives before issuing new SCPDs. Supervisors who select SCPDs save
      the time required to write a new document and the time a position classification specialist would need to determine the
      correct pay plan or schedule, occupation series or code, and grade. SCPDs can also be used as templates for a unique
      CPD that requires a new classification analysis.
      15.66.4. Air Force CPSs with relatively large numbers of serviced civilian personnel retain position classification
      authority and responsibilities until they transition to AFPC/DPIC. AFPC/DPCI performs classification support for
      installations with smaller civilian employee populations. From either source, supervisors can seek assistance in
      developing CPDs or selecting or modifying SCPDs.
15.67. Filling Jobs:
      15.67.1. Vacant civilian positions are filled using a variety of recruitment sources consistent with the priorities
      established and subject to the requirements of other pertinent Office of Personnel Management (OPM), DoD, and Air
      Force procedures. Employees with mandatory selection or priority referral rights normally include those adversely
      affected by RIF through downgrade or separation. These priorities may also include transfer of function declinations,
      overseas returnees, RIF reclassification, civilian spouses, or spouses of Regular Air Force military following a change
      in duty location. As a result, supervisors are not always able to select from a list of applicants. Supervisors may
      consult with a staffing specialist in the CPS or AFPC to determine appropriate recruitment sources. A vacancy for
      competitive fill actions is announced, candidates are screened by AFPC, and one or more lists of candidates are
      referred to the supervisor.
      15.67.2. Civilians with qualifying experience and/or education can enter civil service at different pay grade levels. The
      competitive staffing process used by the Air Force and other Federal agencies attempts to determine the relative
      qualifications of the candidates and refers only the best qualified for selection. Directly related experience and college
      education are the primary indicators of qualifications in most GS or equivalent pay schedules (white collar)
      occupations. Technical schools and craft certifications add to work experience for ranking the quality of employees or
      applicants in Federal Wage System (FWS) crafts and trades.
      15.67.3. Competitive placements require collaboration between supervisors and staffing specialists at the CPS or
      AFPC. Staffing specialists advise supervisors regarding recruitment sources. Supervisors have the option of choosing
      internal, external, or both recruitment sources. Internal recruitment includes current permanent DoD employees.
      External recruitment may include such options as all U.S. citizens, transfers from other non-DOD agencies,
      reinstatement of former career and/or career-conditional employees, and various veterans‘ preference applicants.
      15.67.4. Once established priority requirements are cleared, the vacancy is announced for competitive actions. The
      supervisor is issued a candidate referral list of qualified candidate names. Once the supervisor receives the candidate
      referral list, he or she may confer with the CPS for interview procedures. If an interview is used as part of the selection
      process, the supervisor arranges the interview. Should the selecting official choose to interview, questions must be
      approved by the CPS prior to use. All candidates should be asked the same questions, and the interview periods should
      be of relatively equal length. Some interview requirements may be defined by a locally negotiated agreement with the
      representative union.
      15.67.5. Centrally managed career programs cover most vacancies in grades GS-12 through GS-15. Senior functional
      managers set career development and placement policies for employees in career program covered positions. These
      positions are subject to the same recruitment processes as noncentrally managed positions.
15.68. Training and Development.
      Air Force policy provides for necessary training to improve skills needed in employee performance. Supervisors are
      responsible for determining training requirements and working with the CPS or education and training function to
      identify appropriate training sources. Organizational funds must often be used to support training needs; however,
      civilian training funds are often also available.
380                                                                                  1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
      15.68.1. Identifying Training Requirements:
            15.68.1.1. A training-needs survey is conducted annually and provides an opportunity for the supervisor to
            project training requirements for the upcoming fiscal year. Due to unforecasted mission requirements, however,
            supervisors may request an out-of-cycle training need at any time during the year.
            15.68.1.2. Although first-line supervisors are the key individuals in determining development needs, they may
            need additional guidance from higher-level management, other supervisors, or the employees themselves. The
            servicing employee development specialist is available to assist in training needs analysis and identification of
            methods and training sources.
            15.68.1.3. Not all training and developmental needs can or should be met through Air Force sponsorship.
            Employees are responsible for independently pursuing training and education that will prepare them for
            promotion or develop them for career transitions. Such self-development activity is employee initiated and
            accomplished during off-duty hours. Supervisors should encourage civilian employees to participate in self-
            development activities, when appropriate. Civilian tuition assistance is available in some MAJCOMs and FOAs.
      15.68.2. Training Sources:
            15.68.2.1. Primary Training Sources. Once training needs are identified, the next step is to determine training
            sources. The three primary sources of training are agency (Air Force), interagency, and nongovernment.
            Training away from the work site is requested, approved, and documented using SF 182, Authorization,
            Agreement and Certification of Training.
            15.68.2.2. Agency Training. Agency training is conducted by the employer (Air Force) and may include on-
            the-job training (OJT), in-house training, and Air Force formal schools. OJT and in-house training are often the
            most effective because the supervisor tailors the training to meet the specific job requirements. OJT usually is as
            casual as giving a few pointers to a new worker or as formal as a fully structured training program with
            timetables and specified subjects. Therefore, OJT can include directing employees to appropriate publications
            for self-study. Some functional activities also use in-house training. This type of training is very effective when
            a large number of employees need instruction on common aspects of occupational skill requirements.
            15.68.2.3. Air Force Formal Schools. More formalized agency classroom training is available through Air
            Force formal schools listed in the Web-based Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA) located
            at https://etca.randolph.af.mil/. Career field management programs plan for and sponsor developmental
            assignments, tuition assistance, formal training, and education to develop current and future managers.
            Leadership and management developmental opportunities, including intermediate service school and senior
            service school, are available to eligible high-potential civilian employees. Information is available at
            http://www.afciviliancareers.com/apply/howtoapply/.
            15.68.2.4. Interagency Training. This training may be needed if agency sources are not adequate to meet
            identified training needs. Interagency training includes all training sponsored by other U.S. government
            agencies. OPM, the U.S. Departments of Army and Navy, and the U.S. Departments of Labor and Agriculture
            are just a few sources from which to obtain training.
            15.68.2.5. Nongovernmental Training. Federal regulations require agencies to consider and select government
            training sources before turning to nongovernment alternatives. However, nongovernment sources may be
            considered when agency or interagency courses cannot satisfy the training need or when nongovernment
            training is more advantageous. Nongovernment sources incorporate a wide range of seminars, conferences,
            courses, and workshops, as well as curricula offered by private educational institutions.
15.69. Performance, Conduct, and Discipline:
      15.69.1. Performance Planning, Appraisals, and Awards for Employees.
            The employee is advised of the duties and responsibilities of the job and the supervisor‘s performance
            expectations in their CPD. Employees receive annual appraisals on how well they perform their duties.
            Supervisors may reward employees for performing their duties well. A performance award is a management
            option to recognize high performance.
            15.69.1.1. Supervisors set the performance elements (duties and tasks) for the civilian employees they
            supervise. In developing an employee‘s performance elements, supervisors determine the major and important
            requirements of the employee‘s job based on the employee‘s direct contribution to organization or work unit
            objectives.
AFPAM36-2241     1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                           381

          15.69.1.2. Performance standards prescribe how a particular element or duty must be accomplished. Set by
          supervisors, the standards must reflect levels necessary for acceptable performance. When possible, supervisors
          should identify observable behaviors that lead to success on the job. Note: Elements and standards are
          documented in writing on AF Form 860, Civilian Performance Plan, if a CPD is not used.
          15.69.1.3. The performance appraisal is the basis for personnel actions to identify and correct work performance
          problems, recognize and reward quality performance, improve productivity, and grant periodic pay increases.
          Supervisors review the employee‘s performance of each element and rate the performance against each
          element‘s standards and then render an overall summary rating. AFI 36-1001, Managing the Civilian
          Performance Program, provides guidance for evaluating civilian employee performance for GS and FWS
          employees.
          15.69.1.4. Performance awards (performance cash award, time-off award, and quality step increase) can be used
          as tools to motivate GS and FWS employees to perform above an acceptable level as well as compensate them
          for performing beyond expectations. Effective management of the performance awards program can help
          improve productivity and morale in the organization. Employees cannot grieve management decisions regarding
          performance awards.
          15.69.1.5. Poor performance must be corrected. Employees who fail one or more performance elements are
          administered an unacceptable appraisal and will have an opportunity to improve. Causes for poor performance
          are identified (medical conditions, training deficiencies, etc.). However, if performance does not improve to a
          satisfactory level, the employee may be removed from the position. Placement in another position at the same or
          lower grade is possible. Separation from civilian employment is also possible.
    15.69.2. Personal Conduct:
          15.69.2.1. Standards of Conduct. AFI 36-703, Civilian Conduct and Responsibility, and the DoD 5500.7-R,
          Joint Ethics Regulation, cover activities that are mandatory for civilian employees and activities that are
          prohibited. Employees are required to comply with standards of conduct in all official matters. Employees are
          expected to maintain high standards of honesty, responsibility, and accountability and to adhere to the Air Force
          core values of Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence In All We Do.
          15.69.2.2. Required Activities. Among required activities are: furnishing testimony in official investigations
          and hearings consistent with protections against self-incrimination; paying lawful debts and taxes; being present
          for work unless authorized to be absent; complying with health, safety, and all other proper instructions
          regarding work; presenting a positive public image and complying with reasonable dress and grooming
          standards; and maintaining professional relationships with fellow workers, subordinates, and supervisors.
          15.69.2.3. Prohibited Actions. Prohibited actions follow the guidance in federal laws and government-wide
          regulations, as well as DoD and Air Force instructions. Discrimination and sexual harassment, drug and alcohol
          abuse, misuse of government purchase cards, misuse of government computers, vehicles and other equipment,
          taking bribes, conducting personal business at work, and criminal behavior off-duty that reflect adversely on Air
          Force employment are among the prohibited activities. The Air Force does not attempt to list all possible forms
          of improper conduct but warns employees that misconduct will not be tolerated.
    15.69.3. Discipline:
          15.69.3.1. Disciplinary action is taken to correct employee misconduct or performance when the employee can
          control the essentials of the performance problems and has the skills, knowledge, and capacity to perform well
          but is unwilling to do so. Guidance is in AFI 36-704, Discipline and Adverse Actions.
          15.69.3.2. The Air Force goal in the area of civilian discipline is to maintain a constructive work environment.
          If a disciplinary or adverse action must be taken against a civilian employee, it must be done without regard to
          race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or other factors (such as marital status or politics).
          Actions based on an employee‘s inability to perform because of a physical or mental disability should only be
          taken when the employee‘s disability cannot be reasonably accommodated.
          15.69.3.3. The employee must receive advance notice of impending actions. Disciplinary or adverse actions
          must be prompt and equitable and comply with the intent and letter of all governing requirements, and respect
          must be given to the private nature of the actions.
          15.69.3.4. Proper administration of discipline is a chief concern of labor organizations representing Air Force
          employees. Procedures governing disciplinary and adverse actions are common features of most Air Force
          labor-management agreements. Moreover, a basic tenet of federal labor relations law states that an employee
382                                                                                   1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
            who is a member of a bargaining unit has a right to union representation, upon the employee‘s request, during
            an investigatory interview where the employee reasonably believes disciplinary action may result from the
            interview.
            15.69.3.5. Oral admonishment, the least severe disciplinary action, is often adequate to improve work habits or
            correct behavior. For significant misconduct or repeated infractions, a written reprimand may be an appropriate
            penalty. Written reprimands are recorded in the employee personnel record for a specified period, as directed by
            AFI 36-704, or an applicable negotiated labor-management contract.
            15.69.3.6. Suspension is a disciplinary action that may be imposed for more serious infractions when the
            situation indicates that a lesser penalty is not adequate. A suspension is a particularly severe disciplinary action
            that places the employee in a nonpay and nonduty status, usually for a specific length of time. Employees
            accused of serious crime may be suspended indefinitely until criminal justice is complete.
            15.69.3.7. For employees who have received oral admonishments, written reprimands, or suspensions and
            whose behavior continues to be inappropriate, or for such a onetime egregious event of misconduct, removal
            may occur. Like all other disciplinary actions, the supervisor must ensure it is warranted and well documented.
            Reprimands, suspensions, and removals must be coordinated with the CPS and the staff judge advocate (SJA)
            so a procedural violation or an administrative oversight does not jeopardize a valid disciplinary action.
15.70. Working Conditions:
      15.70.1. Pay:
            15.70.1.1. Civilian employees are paid every 2 weeks. GS employee pay is expressed as an annual salary. High
            cost areas have higher GS pay rates. All GS pay rates in the United States include locality pay. GS pay rates
            overseas do not include locality pay and are approximately 10 percent lower than U.S. rates. GS pay scales
            normally increase in January through the legislative process.
            15.70.1.2. The FWS consists of wage grade (WG), wage leader (WL), and wage supervisor (WS). The FWS pay
            is expressed as hourly wage rates. FWS rates vary more between local areas than GS. FWS rates may also be
            increased annually but on an area-by-area basis throughout the year.
            15.70.1.3. Both GS and FWS have steps in each grade. Employees progress through the steps via longevity. The
            GS grades have 10 steps. Within grade or step increases start at 1-year intervals, but slow to 3-year intervals in
            the higher steps. FWS grades have five steps. FWS within grade increases start at 6-month intervals and slow to
            2-year intervals.
            15.70.1.4. Pay for overtime is at time-and-a-half or 1.5 times base pay. Overtime pay for GS employees is
            capped at 1.5 times the GS-10, step 1, pay rate; for employees with rates of basic pay greater than the basic pay
            for GS-10, step 1, the overtime hourly rate is the greater of either the hourly rate of basic pay for GS-10, step 1,
            multiplied by 1.5, or the employee‘s hourly rate of basic pay. Instead of overtime pay, an employee may receive
            compensatory time off for each hour of overtime worked. Work at night, on Sunday, and on a federal holiday
            earns extra pay.
      15.70.2. Work Hours:
            15.70.2.1. Civilian work hours are more precisely defined and less flexible than those of Regular Air Force
            military personnel. Civilian work schedules are defined in such terms as administrative workweek, basic
            workweek, regular tour of duty, uncommon tour of duty, and part-time tour of duty. Most civilians work a
            regular tour of duty. Normally, this is five 8-hour days, Monday through Friday. Uncommon tours of duty (a
            40-hour basic workweek that includes Saturday and/or Sunday or fewer than 5 days, but not more than 6 days of
            a 7-day administrative workweek) are authorized when necessary for mission accomplishment.
            15.70.2.2. Special circumstances permit part-time, intermittent, or special tours of duty. Installation and tenant
            commanders establish, by written order, daily work hours to include designated rest and lunch periods. Two
            types of alternate work schedules can be implemented by organization commanders. Flexible work schedules
            allow employees to start and end work at different times. Compressed work schedules cover 80 hours in a pay
            period in fewer than 10 workdays. The most common schedule has four 9-hour days each week, an 8-hour day
            in 1 week, and a regular day off in the other week. AFI 36-807, Weekly and Daily Scheduling of Work and
            Holiday Observances, covers work scheduling.
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                           383

      15.70.3. Absence and Leave:
            15.70.3.1. Civilian employees earn 13 days of sick leave each year and 13, 20, or 26 days of annual leave,
            depending on their length of service. Annual leave accumulation is capped at 30 days for most GS and FWS
            employees. Employees working overseas can accumulate 45 days. There is no cap on sick leave accumulation.
            15.70.3.2. Annual leave is used for vacations and/or personal reasons and should be approved in advance of
            being taken, unless emergency conditions exist. Leave is charged and taken in 15-minute increments. Sick leave
            for medical appointments or care for a family member should be scheduled and approved in advance except in
            cases of emergency. Illness or injury that keeps an employee away from work should be reported to a supervisor
            during the first two hours of the duty day.
            15.70.3.3. Absence for jury duty, dismissals for extreme weather conditions, or absences excused by the
            installation commander are not charged to annual leave. Employees who have earned compensatory time for
            overtime or time-off awards should schedule absences to use that time like they schedule annual leave. Absence
            and leave are covered in AFI 36-815, Absence and Leave.
15.71. Unions in the Air Force:
      15.71.1. Approximately 70 percent of Air Force civilian employees are covered by labor agreements between unions
      and installations or MAJCOMs. As such, they are members of the bargaining unit, even if they are not dues-paying
      union members. Unions have legal status under federal law. Guidance is included in AFI 36-701, Labor Management
      Relations.
      15.71.2. A labor relations officer or specialist in the CPS is the usual liaison between supervisors and other
      management officials and union officials. The job can be full-time or part of a larger assignment. The labor relations
      officer speaks for management in routine communications with the union and with parties outside the Air Force who
      have roles in labor contract negotiations and dispute resolution.
      15.71.3. A variety of union officials may act for, and make commitments for, unions. These include elected officers
      such as the president, vice president, and treasurer; and appointed officials such as stewards and union delegates to
      special meetings or projects. As part of a democratic organization, the union official may be required to present issues
      to a committee, such as a bargaining committee for approval. At other times, the official may have been delegated
      authority to make commitments. One of the duties of union officials is to raise employee concerns in the early stages
      of policy formulation and to resolve employee complaints. Managers should strive to work with union officials,
      particularly where grievances have been filed, in a professional, nondefensive manner.
      15.71.4. Management and union representatives negotiate collective bargaining agreements (contracts) covering
      grievance procedures, use of official time for union matters, use of Air Force resources by unions such as office space,
      telephone, and computers, and other local or MAJCOM-wide items of interest impacting the working conditions of
      bargaining unit employees. These contracts bind both sides with agreements subject to interpretation by third parties
      outside DoD and Air Force; for example, the Federal Labor Relations Authority and/or arbitrators. Contracts do not
      cover pay, benefits, or other matters governed by Federal laws and government-wide regulations. However, revised
      Air Force instructions that differ from provisions in a contract may need to be negotiated. In recent years, civilian
      performance appraisal changes were not implemented at some installations until conclusion of lengthy negotiations
      between management and unions.
15.72. Dispute Resolution:
      15.72.1. Civilian employees have a variety of avenues to resolve disputes. Labor-management contracts must include a
      negotiated grievance procedure that must be used by members of the bargaining unit. Most start with an option to seek
      resolution using outside neutral facilitators or mediators (alternative dispute resolution). Formal grievances follow two
      or more steps before one side decides to refer the dispute to a paid, outside arbitrator. Costs are usually shared equally
      by the union and management, so union decisions to pursue arbitration are not routine. Subject to challenge on points
      of law or contract terms, arbitrators‘ decisions are final.
      15.72.2. Supervisors, managers, and employees who are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, or who are
      not members of the bargaining unit follow different grievance procedures. AFI 36-1203, Administrative Grievance
      System, covers the administrative grievance process. Administrative grievances are decided by Air Force officials,
      usually the installation commander or designee, although outside fact finders may be used at management‘s option.
      15.72.3. A number of personnel decisions, for example, nonselection for promotion and performance recognition, are
      excluded from administrative grievances and most negotiated grievance procedures. Appeals of adverse actions
      covered by legal appeal rights are also excluded from the administrative grievance system. The Merit System
384                                                                                 1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
      Protection Board (MSPB) hears appeals of suspensions without pay of more than 14 days, demotions (change to lower
      grade), and removals. Disputes pursued as grievances cannot be duplicated as EEO complaints and vice versa. Appeals
      of adverse actions that include allegations of discrimination may be reviewed by both MSPB and the Equal
      Employment Opportunity Commission.
      15.72.4. A different route is taken to resolve union/management disputes concerning the statutory rights of either
      party. The Federal Labor Relations Authority investigates charges of unfair labor practice brought by either union or
      management. The union files most unfair labor practice charges when managers or supervisors are accused of
      changing working conditions or calling formal meetings without proper notice to the union. If found guilty,
      management may be required to revert back to the previous working condition, and the organization commander,
      including a wing commander, can be required to post an admission of managements wrong doing on official base
      bulletin boards.
15.73. Conclusion:
      15.73.1. The Air Force mission requires military members to be prepared for service at all times. Force support
      organizations ensure Airmen‘s families are cared for, pay and entitlements are properly addressed, and their individual
      rights are secure. This chapter included information on manpower management, enlisted assignments, family care,
      reenlistment and retraining opportunities, benefits and services, personnel records and individual rights, the awards
      and decorations program, and the Airman Promotion system.
      15.73.2. This chapter continued with the SNCO promotion program, manpower management, identifying how
      manpower requirements are quantified and how supervisors initiate changes, and using competitive sourcing to
      maximize cost-effectiveness, efficiency and enhance mission capability by taking advantage of services available
      through the private commercial sector. This chapter also introduced civilian personnel management, covering such
      areas as job descriptions, filling positions, training, performance, conduct, and discipline; and working conditions,
      EEO working conditions, and unions. SNCOs require a basic understanding of the subject areas to effectively lead.

                                                    WING SUPPORT
Section 16A—Overview
16.1. Introduction.
      Wing support is comprised of ever-growing self-service technology, as well as men and women who ensure Airmen
      are ready for mission accomplishment. Programs include, but are not limited to, the Air Force Portal, military pay and
      allowances, leave management, LeaveWeb, military equal opportunity (EO), legal services, ground safety, risk
      management (RM), and procedures for prevention of and response to sexual assault. These available services help
      enable Airmen to focus on the mission versus personal issues.

Section 16B—Air Force Portal
16.2. Air Force Portal Simplifies Access:
      16.2.1. In 2000, the U.S. Air Force launched the Air Force Portal to simplify access to information. The mission of the
      Air Force Portal is to provide ready access to the latest Air Force information, services, and combat support
      applications. Since it was first introduced, the Air Force Portal has changed the way we do business. Everyday this
      technology helps us connect, collaborate, and perform our duties in service to our nation. Access is available anytime,
      anywhere, from any Internet-connected computer whether at home, at the office, or deployed with a valid Department
      of Defense (DoD) public key infrastructure (PKI) certificate, such as a common access card (CAC).
      16.2.2. The Air Force Portal provides a single point of entry to Web-based information, self-service applications,
      collaboration tools, and combat support systems, many without requiring a separate user identification and password.
      Users have access to key applications like total force awareness training, myPay, Air Force virtual education center,
      Air Force fitness management system, virtual military personnel flight (vMPF), LeaveWeb, Training Business Area,
      Enterprise-Solution-Supply and many more. On the library page, you can access online periodicals, do research, and
      find valuable education and training materials. The Portal is the entry point to the Global Combat Support System Air
      Force (GCSS-AF). The goal of GCSS-AF is to provide timely, accurate, and trusted combat support information to
      joint and Air Force commanders at all echelons.
      16.2.3. Tremendous growth continues, with the number of registered Air Force and DoD users now over 825,000, with
      over 400,000 average logins per week, and serving millions of web pages per day. It‘s all there—information,
      collaboration, and applications—so you can do your job, manage your career, and live your life in the Air Force.

Section 16C—Military Pay, Allowances, and Entitlements
16.3. Military Pay and Allowances.
      DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, Military Pay Policy and Procedures—Active Duty and Reserve Pay, The Joint Federal
      Travel Regulation (JFTR), and Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 65-116, Volume 1, Defense Joint Military Pay System
      Active Component (DJMS-AC) FSO Procedures, contain guidance on pay and allowances and related entitlements.
      16.3.1. Military (Basic) Pay:
            16.3.1.1. Basic pay is the fundamental component of military pay. Typically, it is the largest component of a
            member‘s pay. Every member is entitled to basic pay while on active duty, with some exceptions such as:
            during periods of unauthorized absence, excess leave, or after an enlistment expires. Annual military pay raises
            are linked to increases in private sector wages, as measured by the employment cost index. The annual military
            pay raise was capped at one-half percent below private-sector growth unless specifically granted a larger
            increase by Congress. Pay raises beginning in 2007 are to be equal to the increase in the employment cost
            index. Pay raises may exceed these automatic levels if authorized and funded by Congress.
            16.3.1.2. Grade and length of military service determine the actual rate of basic pay. Military pay date is
            important because it determines the length of service for pay purposes. In general, the pay date should be the
            same date the individual entered on active duty if he or she had no prior service before entering the Air Force.
            However, if the individual previously served in certain governmental agencies or enlisted under the Delayed
            Enlistment Program before 1 January 1985, the Air Force adjusts the pay date to reflect credit for these periods.
            Periods of absence without leave (AWOL), desertion, and sickness or injury due to personal misconduct will
            result in negative pay date adjustments.
386                                                                                1 OCTOBER 2013        AFPAM36-2241
      16.3.2. Leave and Earnings Statement (LES).
            Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Form 702, Defense Finance and Accounting Service Leave
            and Earnings Statement, is a comprehensive statement of a member‘s entitlements, deductions, allotments,
            leave information, tax-withholding information, and Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) information. Verify and keep
            your leave and earnings statement (LES) each month. If your pay varies significantly and you don‘t understand
            why or if you have any questions, consult your finance office. The LES is available electronically, and members
            can use the myPay system to view the LES as well as to initiate changes to selected items affecting their pay.
16.4. Military Allowances and Entitlements.
      Allowances are monies provided for specific needs such as food or housing. Monetary allowances are provided when
      the government does not provide for that specific need. For example, the quantity of government housing is not
      sufficient to house all military members and their families. Those who live in government housing do not receive full
      housing allowances. Those who do not live in government housing receive allowances to assist with the cost of
      obtaining commercial housing. The most common allowances are basic allowance for subsistence (BAS) and basic
      allowance for housing (BAH). Most members receive both of these allowances, and in many cases, these allowances
      comprise a significant portion of the member‘s total pay. Other than continental United States (CONUS) cost-of-living
      allowance (COLA), allowances are not taxable, which is an additional embedded benefit of military pay.
      16.4.1. Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS).
            BAS is a nontaxable allowance used to offset the cost of the service member‘s meals. Most junior grade enlisted
            members assigned to single-type government quarters at their permanent duty station (PDS) are required to eat
            in the government dining facilities, receive BAS, and are charged the discounted meal rate which is deducted
            from their pay. When certified by the commanding officer or designee, members are allowed to claim
            reimbursement for missed meals.
      16.4.2. Housing Allowances.
            Housing allowances are based on member‘s grade, dependency status, and location. The location determines
            whether the allowance is BAH or overseas housing allowance (OHA). In some cases, members who are not able
            to take their families to the PDS are eligible for payment of family separation housing (FSH) allowance in
            addition to BAH or OHA.
            16.4.2.1. Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH). The intent of BAH is to provide uniformed service members
            accurate and equitable housing compensation based on housing costs in local civilian housing markets. It is
            payable when government quarters are not provided. Many Air Force installations have privatized their
            quarters, meaning that private contractors have taken over much of the previously Air Force-owned-and-
            operated family housing. Members in these privatized quarters are entitled to BAH, and the rental agreement
            requires a rent amount equal to the BAH entitlement paid via allotment. However, some privatized housing
            contractors are now accepting less than full BAH as rent in order to eliminate vacant housing. Members without
            dependents residing in government single-type quarters are entitled to partial BAH unless the quarters
            (including government-leased quarters) exceed the minimum standards of single quarters for their grade.
            Members living in single-type government quarters who pay court-ordered child support may qualify for basic
            allowance for housing differential (BAH-DIFF). The LES displays the BAH rate below the heading
            ENTITLEMENTS, listed as BAH. The PAY DATA portion of the LES shows the BAH type and BAH
            dependents, as well as other housing-related data.
            16.4.2.2. Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA). OHA is a cost reimbursement-based allowance to help defray
            housing costs incident to assignments to a PDS outside the United States. Members are reimbursed actual rental
            costs not to exceed the maximum OHA rate for each locality, grade, and dependency status. There are two types
            of allowances paid under OHA: Move-in housing allowance (MIHA) and monthly OHA including a
            utility/recurring maintenance allowance. The location MIHA (for those who qualify) is based on the average
            ―move-in‖ costs for members. The monthly OHA is the rent, up to the rental allowance at a PDS, plus the
            utility/recurring maintenance allowance.
            16.4.2.3. Family Separation Housing (FSH). The purpose of FSH is to pay a member for added housing
            expenses resulting from enforced separation from dependents. There are two types of FSH: FSH-BAH (FSH-B)
            and FSH-OHA (FSH-O). FSH-B is payable in a monthly amount equal to the without-dependent BAH rate
            applicable to the member‘s grade and PDS. FSH-O is payable in a monthly amount up to the without-dependent
            OHA rate applicable to the member‘s grade and PDS. For additional guidance, consult the Joint Federal Travel
            Regulation (JFTR) at http://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/site/travelreg.cfm.
AFPAM36-2241        1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                      387

      16.4.3. Clothing Replacement Allowance (CRA).
            Enlisted military members receive an annual allowance to help maintain, repair, and replace initial issue
            uniform items as it becomes necessary. There are two types of CRA: CRA Basic, a preliminary replacement
            allowance paid annually between the 6th and 36th month of active duty; and CRA Standard, an allowance that
            automatically replaces CRA Basic after 36 months of active duty. Entitlement to either allowance depends on
            the individual‘s ―entered on active duty date‖ in his or her master military pay account. This allowance is paid
            on or near the anniversary date of active duty and appears on the LES opposite CLOTHING under the
            ENTITLEMENTS heading.
      16.4.4. Family Separation Allowance (FSA).
            FSA is a type of allowance payable to members in addition to any other allowance or per diem to which a
            member may be entitled. FSA has three different categories: FSA-R, FSA-S, and FSA-T. A member may not
            receive more than one payment of FSA for the same period, even though qualified for FSA-R (restricted) and
            FSA-S (serving on ships) or FSA-T (temporary). The purpose of FSA is to compensate qualified members for
            added expenses incurred because of an enforced family separation. Members are eligible for FSA-R if
            transportation of dependents, including dependents acquired after effective date of orders, is not authorized at
            government expense, and the dependents do not live in the vicinity of the member‘s PDS. FSA-S applies to
            members serving on ships away from the homeport continuously for more than 30 days. A member is eligible
            for FSA-T if the member is on temporary duty (TDY) away from the permanent station continuously for more
            than 30 days, and the member‘s dependents are not residing at or near the TDY station. This includes members
            required to perform a period of the TDY before reporting to their initial station of assignment.
      16.4.5. Station Allowances outside the United States.
            The aim of overseas station allowances is to help defray the higher than normal cost of living or cost in
            procuring housing in overseas areas. Allowances the DoD authorizes only at certain overseas locations include
            temporary lodging allowance and cost-of-living allowance. Members receive information regarding their
            specific entitlements during in-processing at the new location. Members may also receive information from
            their local finance office upon notification of a pending overseas assignment.
      16.4.6. CONUS Cost-of-Living Allowance.
            CONUS COLA is payable to members assigned to designated ―high cost‖ areas within the CONUS. For
            additional information, see JFTR, chapter 8.
16.5. Special and Incentive Pay.
      A number of special and incentive pays recognize certain aspects of duty, including, but not limited to hazardous duty
      incentive pay, imminent danger pay, special duty assignment pay, enlisted flying duty incentive pay, and hardship duty
      pay location. Also included are enlistment and reenlistment bonuses.
16.6. Deductions.
      The two general categories of payroll deductions are involuntary and voluntary deductions.
      16.6.1. Involuntary Deductions:
            16.6.1.1. Withholding Income Tax:
            16.6.1.1.1. DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, Chapter 44, outlines specific taxable and nontaxable items. All ―pay‖
            is considered income for federal and state income tax purposes (for example, basic pay, incentive pay, special
            pay, lump-sum payment of accrued leave, and separation pay). Allowances considered nontaxable on 9
            September 1986 remain nontaxable. For example, BAS remains nontaxable and CONUS COLA is taxable.
            16.6.1.1.2. The LES reflects the current month and year-to-date income for social security, federal income tax,
            and state income tax purposes under the headings ―FICA TAXES,‖ ―FED TAXES,‖ and ―STATE TAXES‖ in
            the middle of the form. Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) is responsible for ensuring the LES
            provides the necessary pay and entitlement information.
            16.6.1.2. Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) Taxes. The FICA requires federal agencies to
            withhold FICA (Social Security and Medicare) taxes from the basic pay of military members covered by the
            Social Security Act and to pay matching FICA taxes to the Social Security Administration.
388                                                                                  1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
            16.6.1.3. Federal Income Tax Withholding (FITW). FITW is used to provide for national programs such as
            defense, community development, and law enforcement. The FITW complies with the Treasury Department
            Circular E as implemented in military service directives. A member may authorize an additional monthly
            amount of FITW.
            16.6.1.4. State Income Tax Withholding (SITW). The tax laws of the state where the member is a legal
            resident determine whether the member must pay state taxes. The amount withheld depends upon the state tax
            rate. One-time payments may also be subject to state tax. The state for tax purposes is reflected in the first
            column on the LES under STATE TAXES.
            16.6.1.5. Armed Forces Retirement Home (AFRH). Monthly deductions from the pay of regular enlisted
            members, up to a maximum of $1, are set by the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) after consulting with the
            AFRH Board. The money helps support the United States Soldiers‘ and Airmen‘s Home and the Naval Home.
      16.6.2. Voluntary Deductions:
            16.6.2.1. Military members may establish voluntary deductions such as allotments to help administer their
            personal finances. Each member may have up to six purely discretionary allotments covering a variety of
            financial obligations, such as repayment of home loans, automobile loans, and loans from debt consolidation
            companies. Members may also have an allotment for a personal savings program, support of family members,
            and payment of insurance premiums. Members may control certain discretionary allotments through myPay
            however, there can be no more than one discretionary allotment to the same allottee. Nondiscretionary
            allotments have limited uses, such as charitable contributions, child or spousal support, garnishment for
            commercial debts, and delinquent travel charge card debt.
            16.6.2.2. To allow for sufficient processing time, allotments should be requested about 30 days before the
            desired month. Occasionally, an allotment transaction may occur after the cutoff date for the midmonth payday.
            This will result in the entire amount of the allotment being deducted from the end-of-month pay. Normally, if
            the member is paid twice a month, the allotment is deducted in equal amounts from the midmonth and end-of-
            month pay. If the individual receives pay once a month, the entire amount is deducted from the monthly
            paycheck. There are certain cutoff dates that affect when allotments can be processed. Contact your local
            finance office for assistance.
            16.6.2.3. The maximum amount of Servicemembers Group Life Insurance (SGLI) coverage is $400,000 and
            members are covered, by law, at the maximum rate unless they decline or reduce coverage. SGLI automatically
            insures an eligible member against death when the member is performing active duty or active duty for training
            for an ordered period of more than 30 days. However, an individual may choose less coverage in amounts
            divisible by $50,000 or elect no coverage, but he or she must do so in writing. Additionally, family SGLI
            (FSGLI) covers spouses and dependent children when the eligible member also participates in SGLI coverage,
            including military spouses. There is a monthly deduction for spousal coverage: the amount of the deduction
            depends on the amount of coverage. Each child is covered in the amount of $10,000 at no cost to the member.
            The member may not elect to insure any child for less than $10,000. SGLI and FSGLI premiums are deducted
            from members‘ military pay each month. The military personnel section (MPS) is the office of primary
            responsibility for administering the program.
16.7. Military Pay Schedules:
      16.7.1. Regular Payments.
            Military members are paid on a monthly basis with the option to receive payments once or twice per month.
            Members receive a statement (net pay advice – NPA) of the net amount pay and the financial organization to
            which it was sent at midmonth (if receiving a payment) and a comprehensive statement of pay, the LES, at the
            end of the month via myPay. These statements are created centrally by DFAS. Military members must
            understand the pay system has processing cutoff dates that affect updates to their pay. The cutoff date is the day
            when DFAS stops processing transactions against pay accounts for the current period so the regular payroll
            process can begin. The cutoff is necessary to compute, prepare, and transfer funds. While the cutoff dates
            fluctuate from month to month, they are generally around the 6th for the midmonth payday and the 20th for the
            end-of-month payday.
      16.7.2. Local, Partial, and Emergency Partial Payments.
            Local cash payments are normally only authorized for overseas areas where on base military banking facilities
            are not readily available. Exceptions may be granted for members assigned to classified or contingency
            operations where the exigencies of their assignments may require local cash or partial payments. Under
AFPAM36-2241      1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                        389

            extenuating circumstances, a stateside member may receive an emergency partial payment if the payment is
            deemed time sensitive and required within 24 hours due to an unforeseen set of circumstances. The member‘s
            commander may authorize immediate cash payments up to the amount of accrued entitlement to date when
            deemed appropriate to the mission. Non-cash partial payments may be made, via electronic funds transfer (EFT)
            and deposited into the member‘s financial institution, normally in 2 to 3 business days. Partial payments are
            limited to the amount of pay and allowances the member has accrued to the date of the payment.
      16.7.3. Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Advance Payments.
            Advance payments provide members with funds to meet extraordinary expenses incident to a government-
            ordered relocation that are directly related to the PCS and not covered by other entitlements. A PCS advance
            payment is an advance of up to 3 months of basic pay, less the mandatory deductions of FICA, FITW, SITW,
            Air Force Retirement Home, and all known debts currently being deducted. A1Cs and below must have the
            approval of their immediate commander for advance pay. If the desired repayment period is greater than 12
            months or the amount requested is greater than 1 month‘s basic pay, then all members must have the approval
            of their immediate commander. Note: Repayment periods greater than 12 months are only approved in cases of
            financial hardship.
16.8. Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Allowances:
      16.8.1. Transportation Allowance.
            When military members go PCS, they may receive a variety of travel allowances. Some of these allowances
            include:
            16.8.1.1. Government-Procured Transportation. Available U.S.-certificated air carriers must be used for all
            commercial air transportation of persons/property when government funds the air travel. When the
            authorizing/order-issuing official determines U.S.-certificated air carriers are unavailable, commercial air
            transportation on a non-U.S.-certificated air carrier may be authorized/approved. Documentation explaining
            why U.S.-certificated air carrier service is not available must be provided to the traveler. Endorsements on the
            travel orders or government travel procurement document made in accordance with Service regulations are
            acceptable. Travel time for travel by government conveyance (except government automobile) or common
            carriers obtained by government-procured transportation is allowed for the actual time needed to travel over the
            direct route including necessary delays for the transportation mode used.
            16.8.1.2. Use of Privately Owned Conveyance. Uniformed service policy is to authorize/approve (as
            distinguished from permit) privately owned conveyance travel if acceptable to the member and advantageous to
            the government based on the facts in each case. Other allowable travel and transportation options include
            government conveyance or commercial carrier. Reimbursement of parking fees, ferry fares, road, bridge and
            tunnel tolls is authorized for privately owned conveyance over the most direct route between the stations
            involved. The member is also authorized a flat per diem at the standard continental United States (CONUS) rate
            for each PCS travel day between authorized points, up to the allowable travel time.
            16.8.1.3. Personally Procured Transportation. DoD policy mandates the use of the commercial travel office
            (CTO) for all official transportation requirements. A member who, despite the DoD policy, procures common
            carrier transportation at personal expense for official travel is authorized reimbursement up to the amount
            authorized. However, reimbursement must not exceed the cost for the authorized transportation and
            accommodations over a usually traveled direct route according to a schedule necessary to meet the requirements
            of the order. Commands/units are expected to take appropriate disciplinary action when a member and (or) an
            authorizing/order-issuing official fail to follow the regulations concerning CTO use. Consult the JFTR for
            additional information.
            16.8.1.4. Mixed Modes. When both government-procured and personally procured modes of transportation are
            used, the Air Force uses a combination of rules governed by the JFTR. The local finance office can provide
            specific guidance.
      16.8.2. Dependent Travel.
            A military member receives monetary allowance in lieu of transportation and flat rate per diem for the official
            distance dependents travel with him or her by privately owned vehicle (POV). If dependents purchase
            commercial common carrier transportation, the member may be reimbursed for the actual cost of the
            transportation, not to exceed the cost the government would have incurred for ordered travel, and the member
            receives a per diem allowance for dependents. When the Air Force restricts travel of dependents to a location
390                                                                                  1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
            overseas, dependents may move at government expense to any place within the CONUS the member
            designates. With special approval, dependents may move outside the CONUS.
      16.8.3. Dislocation Allowance.
            This allowance is paid at a rate determined by the SECDEF. It is payable to all members with dependents when
            dependents relocate their household goods in conjunction with a PCS. It is also payable to members without
            dependents if they are not assigned permanent government quarters upon arrival at the new permanent duty
            station (PDS).
      16.8.4. Temporary Lodging Expense (TLE) and Temporary Lodging Allowance (TLA).
            A member arriving or departing PCS at a location within the CONUS may receive temporary lodging expense
            to help defray the added living expenses incurred while occupying temporary lodging. A member arriving or
            departing PCS at a location outside the CONUS may receive temporary lodging allowance to help defray the
            added living expenses incurred while occupying temporary lodging.
      16.8.5. Shipment of Household Goods (HHG).
            A member experiencing a PCS move may ship household goods within certain weight limitations at
            government expense. Authorized weight allowances normally depend on the grade of the member and whether
            he or she has dependents. A member may be reimbursed for personally arranging for the shipment of HHG.
            Claims should be prepared and submitted according to Service regulations. The government‘s cost limit is based
            on the member‘s maximum HHG weight allowance (that is, if the member transports HHG in excess of the
            authorized weight allowance, all payments are based on the authorized weight allowance).
      16.8.6. Shipment of Unaccompanied Baggage.
            This provision refers to the portion of the PCS weight allowance ordinarily transported separately from the
            major or bulk of HHG and usually is transported by an expedited mode. When the expedited transportation
            mode is commercial air, a maximum of 1,000 pounds (net), may be transported.
      16.8.7. Shipment of POV.
            When authorized, members may ship one POV at government expense when ordered to go on a PCS to, from,
            or between locations overseas. POV storage may be provided when shipment is prohibited or restricted.
      16.8.8. Mobile Home Shipment.
            Members who own a mobile home should contact the traffic management office to arrange for its
            transportation. In certain circumstances, members may arrange or contract personally for the movement of the
            mobile home. Shipment of a mobile home is in lieu of HHG transportation.
16.9. Temporary Duty (TDY) Entitlements:
      16.9.1. Per Diem.
            This allowance helps defray the cost of quarters, meals, and certain incidentals, Per diem rates depend on the
            TDY location. Travelers are paid a prescribed amount for meals and incidental expenses plus the actual amount
            for lodging, not to exceed the maximum lodging rate for the specific location. The rates depend on the
            availability of government facilities, such as quarters and dining facilities.
      16.9.2. Transportation.
            Policy mandates that uniformed service members use available CTOs to arrange official travel. The mode of
            transportation used between the points designated in the travel order will determine the transportation
            entitlement. On the other hand, if the member receives authorization to travel at personal expense, he or she will
            receive a reimbursement. The member may drive a POV and be reimbursed mileage if authorized by the orders
            issuing authority.
      16.9.3. Miscellaneous Reimbursable Expenses.
            Reimbursable expenses include lodging taxes (United States and possessions only); tips for baggage handling at
            airports; official telephone calls; travel from home or place of lodging to the servicing transportation terminal
            by either taxi, limousine, bus, or POV; fees for traveler‘s checks, passports, and visas; and rental vehicles when
            authorized on travel orders.
AFPAM36-2241      1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                          391

     16.9.4. TDY Expenses:
           16.9.4.1. When the TDY is completed, the traveler is responsible for electronically filing a voucher (Defense
           Travel System) or preparing his or her DD Form 1351-2, Travel Voucher or Subvoucher, to claim
           reimbursement for official travel. The traveler is responsible for the truth and accuracy of the information.
           When the traveler signs the form (and this signature authority must never be delegated), he or she attests that the
           statements are true and complete and that he or she is aware of the liability for filing a false claim. All claims
           and attached statements shall be completed using ink, typewriter, or computer-generated forms. The member is
           expected to pay the amount billed from the travel card company upon receipt of the monthly statement.
           16.9.4.2. EFT is the mandatory means by which a travel claim is settled. Supervisors may authorize alternate
           methods of payment in limited situations where the traveler does not have access to an account at a financial
           institution that can receive EFT transmissions. Split disbursement, which permits direct payment via EFT to the
           travel card contractor for charges incurred on the travel card and to the cardholder for any residual amount, shall
           be made available to travelers as a payment option. This payment option enables travelers to elect a split
           disbursement for the amount of money to be forwarded to the card contractor. In cases where the traveler is
           TDY for 45 days or more, he or she shall file an interim voucher every 30 days and use split disbursement to
           pay the bill. An extended TDY trip is no excuse for late payment of the bill.
16.10. The Government Travel Card Program:
     16.10.1. Purpose.
           The travel card program is intended to facilitate and standardize the use by DoD travelers of a safe, effective,
           convenient, commercially available method to pay for expenses incident to official travel, including local travel.
           The travel card is used to improve DoD cash management, reduce DoD and traveler administrative workloads,
           and facilitate better service to DoD travelers. In addition, because of the refund feature of the travel card
           program, the program results in cost savings for the Department.
     16.10.2. Agency Program Coordinators (APC).
           Agency Program Coordinators are appointed in writing, act on behalf of the unit commander, and are
           responsible for program execution and management of the day-to-day operations for their component‘s DoD
           travel card program. Each APC, in conjunction with the card contractor, maintains an up-to-date list of all
           current cardholders and accounts to include information such as account names, account numbers, addresses,
           and telephone numbers.
     16.10.3. Card Use.
           Unless otherwise exempted, all DoD personnel are required to use the government-sponsored, contractor-issued
           travel charge card for all expenses arising from official government travel. These expenses include lodging,
           transportation expenses, local ground transportation, and rental car expenses authorized on travel orders. The
           cardholder, while in a travel status, may use the card for nonreimbursable incidental travel expenses such as
           rental movies, personal telephone calls, exercise fees, and beverages when these charges are not part of a
           separate room billing or meal and are reasonable.
           16.10.3.1. Government travel charge cardholders obtain cash, as authorized, through automated teller machines
           (ATM), rather than obtaining cash advances from a DoD disbursing officer.
           16.10.3.2. Travelers may use the travel card at a specified network of automated teller machines (ATM) to
           obtain cash needed to pay for ―out-of-pocket‖ travel-related expenses. The card contractor assigns a personal
           identification number (PIN) to each cardholder, together with card issuance to permit ATM access. Note: The
           personal identification number (PIN) is unique to the specific card and must be safeguarded. ATM advances
           will not be obtained earlier than 3 working days before scheduled travel and are limited to authorized expenses
           exempt from mandatory card usage (meals, incidentals, miscellaneous expenses, etc.). The card contractor will
           charge the cardholder a transaction fee for ATM use. This includes international transaction fees made as a
           result of any foreign currency conversion. These charges, which appear on the cardholder‘s billing statement,
           are reimbursable expenses. In addition, some banks charge a service fee for ATM access. This fee is also
           reimbursable.
     16.10.4. Card Abuse.
           Commanders or supervisors will not tolerate the misuse of the DoD travel card. Cardholders who misuse their
           DoD travel cards are subject to appropriate administrative or disciplinary action. The cardholder will only use
           the travel card while in official travel status.
392                                                                                 1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
      16.10.5. How to Pay the Card Company.
            The travel card contractor provides detailed monthly bills. Cardholders are responsible for payment in full of
            outstanding balances due in the monthly billing statement from the card contractor. Payments should be made
            promptly (within the current billing cycle). Military service members who travel TDY and use government
            credit cards must use the split disbursement feature which automatically pays the credit card vendor for credit
            card charges while on official travel. Cardholders must designate the total outstanding balance incurred while
            traveling as split-disbursement when filing their vouchers. A late fee per billing cycle may be assessed for
            individually billed accounts that are 75 days past the closing date of the account statement on which the charges
            first appeared.
      16.10.6. Travel Card Considerations During a PCS.
            Individuals are required to use the travel card during a PCS. Credit limit increases and deferred payment options
            are available to accommodate the extended travel times of a PCS move. The individual is still responsible for
            keeping the bill current while in a PCS status. The cardholder must notify the losing APC before departing the
            old duty station and gaining APC upon reporting to the new duty station. The losing APC will set a future date
            in the card company‘s Electronic Access System (EAS) to deactivate the cardholder‘s account based on PCS
            travel order report no later than date. The APC will also submit a transfer request to the card company so the
            individual is removed from that unit‘s reporting hierarchy level. The gaining APC will ensure the transfer
            request is processed by the card company when the member arrives so the account information can be updated.
            The gaining APC will also clear the deactivation date within the card company‘s EAS.
      16.10.7. Delinquencies:
            16.10.7.1. Cardholders are responsible for payment in full of the amount stated on the monthly billing
            statement. The card contractor may also initiate pay garnishment proceedings through the judicial system
            against cardholder accounts over 126 days delinquent. Upon written request of the card contractor, DoD may
            act on their behalf and collect by payroll deduction from the amount of pay owed to the cardholder any funds
            the cardholder owes to the charge card contractor as a result of delinquencies not disputed by the cardholder on
            the government travel charge card.
            16.10.7.2. If the card contractor cannot initiate pay garnishment proceedings and the cardholder account is over
            210 days delinquent, the card contractor will charge off the account and report the delinquency to the credit
            bureau. The debt will then be collected through a third party collection agency assigned by the card contractor.
      16.10.8. Collection of Debts:
            16.10.8.1. Debts to the Federal Government. An Air Force member who owes debts to the federal
            government or instrumentalities of the government does not have to give his or her consent for the Air Force to
            collect. Generally, for debts that exceed $100, the individual must be given due process (that is, the individual
            must receive notification of the pending collection of a debt and be given a chance to repay the debt before any
            withholding action occurs). However, due process need not be completed before the start of a collection action
            if an individual‘s estimated date of separation is not sufficient to complete collection and the Air Force would
            be unlikely to collect the debt. Due process may not apply when the collection action can be completed within
            two monthly pay periods. The Air Force may also collect debts involving any federal agency, portions of a
            reenlistment bonus not served, delinquent hospital bills for family members, excess shipment of HHG, loss or
            damage to government property, and erroneous payments made to or on behalf of the member by the Air Force.
            16.10.8.2. Waiver and Remission Provisions. Military members may request relief from valid debts by
            applying for waiver or remission of the debt. The local financial services office (FSO) has specific guidance and
            can provide assistance regarding these programs.
            16.10.8.3. Waiver of Claims for Erroneous Payments of Pay and Allowances. When a member receives
            erroneous pay or allowances, he or she may apply for a waiver of claims by the United States. A waiver may be
            granted when there is no indication of fraud, misrepresentation, fault, or lack of good faith on the part of the
            member or any other person having an interest in obtaining a waiver of the claim. DFAS will rule on all
            waivers. When filing for a waiver, the collection of the indebtedness must be started.
            16.10.8.4. Remission. A Regular Air Force or separated member, or his or her commander, may apply for
            remission of a member‘s indebtedness to the United States. The Air Force may not remit or cancel any debt due
            to noncollection of court-martial forfeiture. In addition to the circumstances creating the debt and the issue of
            good faith on the part of the member, financial hardship may be is a factor for consideration.
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                          393

16.11. The U.S. Air Force Uniformed Thrift Savings Plan:
      16.11.1. Purpose.
             TSP is a retirement savings and investment plan established for federal employees as part of the Federal
             Employees‘ Retirement Act of 1986. Participation in the plan for uniformed service members is authorized by
             law. The plan offers tax-deferred advantages similar to those in an individual retirement account (IRA) or
             401(k) plan. TSP contributions are taken out of pay before taxes are computed; as a result, individual tax
             obligations are reduced.
      16.11.2. Participating in the TSP.
             The maximum amount a member may contribute from basic pay is 100 percent, less statutory deductions; this
             amounts to approximately 92 to 94 percent. Members may also choose to contribute up to 100 percent of special
             and incentive pays and bonuses as long as they are also contributing from basic pay. In 2012, the annual limit
             became $17,000. The amounts contributed within each authorized category must be stated as a whole percent.
             Members may control their TSP via myPay; those requiring customer assistance for TSP pay-related questions,
             LES interpretations, and financial issues may contact their FSO.
      16.11.3. Education and Awareness.
             The Personal Financial Readiness is a core service of the airman and family readiness center. It offers
             information, education, and personal financial counseling to help individuals and families maintain financial
             stability and reach their financial goals.

Section 16D—Leave Management
16.12. Policy.
      As stated in AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program, lengthy respites from the work environment tend to have a
      beneficial effect on an individual‘s psychological and physical status. Therefore, an aggressive leave program is an
      essential military requirement. According to DoDI 1327.6, Leave and Liberty Policy and Procedures, all officers in
      command, major headquarters, and the military departments shall ensure that secondary and nonessential efforts are
      not imposed which may prevent an aggressive leave program.
16.13. Accruing Leave:
      16.13.1. Leave accrues at the rate of 2 1/2 calendar days per month of active duty. Military requirements may prevent
      members from using their planned leave. Annual leave accrual is temporarily increased from 60 to 75 days until 30
      September 2013. Service members may now carry over up to 75 days of accrued leave from one fiscal year to the next.
      The expression ―use or lose‖ means that leave in excess of 75 days is lost if not used by the end of the fiscal year (FY)
      (30 September). In the event service members are unable to use the accrued leave in excess of 75 days prior to 30
      September, due to mission requirements, approval may be requested to carry over the excess leave days (refer to
      paragraph 16.14).
      16.13.2. The Air Force can pay members for unused leave at certain points in their careers, such as reenlistment,
      retirement, separation under honorable conditions, or death. By law, members may receive accrued leave payment up
      to a maximum of 60 days during their military careers. However, the DoD policy expresses Congressional concern
      that members use leave to relax from the pressures of duties and not as a method of compensation. Note: Members do
      not earn leave when they are AWOL, in an unauthorized leave status, in confinement as a result of a court-martial
      sentence, in an excess leave status, or on appellate leave under Title 10, United States Code Section 876a, Leave
      Required to Be Taken Pending Review of Certain Court-Martial Convictions.
16.14. Special Leave Accrual (SLA).
      SLA retention limits are increased. Under the new limits, SLA earned in combat zones may now be kept for 4 fiscal
      years; SLA earned in support of operations may now be kept for 2 fiscal years. An additional one-time SLA sell-back
      is authorized for enlisted service members. Under this provision, an enlisted service member may sell back up to 30
      days of SLA. Such a sell back counts toward the service member‘s cap of 60 days over a career. This provision has no
      termination date. Members lose any leave in excess of 75 days at the end of the FY unless they are eligible for SLA.
      Eligible members who lose leave on 1 October may have only that portion of leave restored that could not possibly
      have been used before the end of the FY. Major command (MAJCOM) or field operating agency directors of
      personnel or equivalents (Colonel or above) will approve SLA for their organizations. Any commander in the chain of
      command may deny a member‘s request for SLA without referring it to a higher-level authority. Members are eligible
      for SLA if any of the following circumstances prohibit them from taking leave:
394                                                                                   1 OCTOBER 2013           AFPAM36-2241
      16.14.1. Deployment to an operational mission at the national level for at least 60 consecutive days.
      16.14.2. Assignment or deployment for at least 60 consecutive days to unit, headquarters, and supporting staffs when
      their involvement supporting a designated operational mission prohibited them from taking leave.
      16.14.3. Deployment to a hostile-fire or imminent danger pay area for 120 or more consecutive days and entitled to
      hostile fire and (or) imminent danger pay for 4 or more consecutive months. In this situation, the active duty pay
      system automatically carries over up to 75 days of leave. Note: In some instances, the deployment may overlap two
      FYs, for example, a deployment from 15 September until 14 November.
16.15. Beginning and Ending Leave.
      Leave must begin and end in the local area. The term ―local area‖ means the place of residence from which the
      member commutes to the duty station on a daily basis. This also applies to leave en route to a PCS or TDY
      assignment. In this case, the local area, as defined at the old and new PDS, applies. The old PDS is for beginning
      leave; the new PDS is for ending leave. Making a false statement of leave taken may result in punitive action under the
      Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Regardless of the amount of leave authorized, finance calculates leave
      based on the actual date of departure and date of return. General rules on charging leave are as follows:
      16.15.1. Use AF Form 988, Leave Request/Authorization, for all types of leave and permissive temporary duty
      (PTDY) when LeaveWeb cannot be used. (See AFMAN 65-116, Volume 2, Defense Joint Military Pay System
      (DJMS) Unit Procedures Excluding FSO, Chapter 7, for information concerning LeaveWeb.) (Exception: When
      members take leave en route with PCS or TDY travel, the FSO uses the travel voucher to determine authorized travel
      and chargeable leave.) Nonduty days and holidays are chargeable leave days if they occur during an authorized period
      of leave. If leave includes a weekend, a member cannot end leave on a Friday and begin it again on Monday. Further,
      unit commanders will not approve successive Monday through Friday leaves (or periods of leave surrounding other
      nonduty days) except under emergency or unusual circumstances as determined by the unit commander.
      16.15.2. A member who is unable to report to duty upon expiration of leave because of illness or injury must advise
      the leave approving authority. The next of kin, attending physician, representative at the nearest medical treatment
      facility, or American Red Cross representative may act on the member‘s behalf when the member is incapacitated and
      unable to provide notification. Upon returning from leave, the member must present a statement from the nearest
      medical treatment facility or attending physician regarding the member‘s medical condition. (Note: The unit
      commander evaluates the statement before authenticating the leave document.) If a member on leave requires
      hospitalization or quarters status, leave is not charged while hospitalized or on quarters. Chargeable leave ends the day
      before and starts again the day following hospitalization or quarters status, regardless of the hour of admission or
      discharge or release from quarters. The unit commander issues an amended leave authorization, if required.
      16.15.3. The MPS and AFPC/DPWCS (Casualty Services Branch) change the member‘s leave status to AWOL when
      the member fails to return to duty at the end of his or her leave period.
16.16. Extension of Leave.
      The member must ask, orally or in writing, for an extension of leave. The extension must be requested sufficiently in
      advance of expiration of leave authorized to permit the member to return to duty at the proper time if the approval
      authority disapproves the extension.
16.17. Recall from Leave.
      Unit commanders may recall members from leave for military necessity or in the best interest of the Air Force. Refer
      to the JFTR to determine if travel and transportation allowances apply. If the unit commander authorizes the member
      to resume leave after the member completes the duty that resulted in recall, a new AF Form 988 or orders must be
      prepared.
16.18. Types of Leave.
      AFI 36-3003 outlines many types of leave, such as:
      16.18.1. Annual Leave.
            Another name for ―ordinary‖ leave is annual leave. Normally, members request leave, as accruing (earning),
            within mission requirements. Members use annual leave to take vacations, attend to parental family needs such
            as illnesses, celebrate traditional national holiday periods, attend spiritual events or other religious observances,
            or as terminal leave with retirement or separation from active duty.
AFPAM36-2241    1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                        395

    16.18.2. Advance Leave.
          Advance leave is leave granted based on a reasonable expectation that a member will accrue at least that much
          leave during the remaining period of active military service. The purpose of advance leave is to enable members
          to resolve emergencies or urgent personal situations when they have limited or no accrued leave. When a
          member has taken all the advance leave that represents what he or she will be accruing during the remaining
          period of active service, unit commanders change member‘s leave status from advance to excess leave. The
          FSO stops or collects, if applicable, all pay and allowances paid after the member‘s leave status changes from
          advance to excess leave.
    16.18.3. Convalescent Leave.
          Convalescent leave is an authorized absence normally for the minimal time needed to meet the medical needs
          for recuperation. Convalescent leave is not chargeable leave. Unit commanders normally approve convalescent
          leave based on recommendations by either the medical treatment facility authority or physician most familiar
          with the member‘s medical condition. When a member elects civilian medical care at personal expense and an
          Air Force physician determines the medical procedure as elective by military medical treatment facility
          authorities, such as cosmetic surgery, the member must use ordinary leave for all absences from duty, including
          convalescence. When medical authorities determine a medical procedure is necessary, such as childbirth, and
          the member elects civilian medical care, the commander, upon the recommendation by either the medical
          treatment facility authority or the attending physician most familiar with the member‘s medical condition may
          grant convalescent leave.
    16.18.4. Emergency Leave.
          Emergency leave is chargeable leave granted for personal or family emergencies involving the immediate
          family. Unit commanders approve emergency leave; however, commanders can delegate leave approval to no
          lower than the first sergeant for enlisted personnel. Normally, verification by the America Red Cross is not
          necessary. However, when the official granting leave has reason to doubt the validity of an emergency situation,
          he or she may request assistance from the military service activity nearest the location of the emergency or,
          when necessary, from the American Red Cross. The initial period of emergency leave is usually for no more
          than 30 days with possible extensions of an additional 30 days. If the individual needs an extension while on
          emergency leave, he or she must contact the unit commander or first sergeant for approval. Unit commanders
          should advise members to apply for a humanitarian or exceptional family member reassignment or hardship
          discharge if the leave period is more than 60 days. HQ AFPC approves emergency leave if leave requested
          results in a member having a cumulative negative leave balance of over 30 days. The member may not request
          emergency leave for reasons such as attending court hearings or the resolution of marital or financial problems;
          the member may, however, request ordinary leave for these situations. Situations when emergency leave is
          normally authorized include:
          16.18.4.1. To visit a terminally ill person in the immediate family of either the member or the member‘s spouse.
          16.18.4.2. When there has been a verified death in the member‘s immediate family or the spouse‘s immediate
          family.
          16.18.4.3. Because the member or someone in the member‘s or spouse‘s immediate family has a life-
          threatening condition due to an accident, illness, or major surgery.
          16.18.4.4. Because the member is affected by a natural disaster, such as a hurricane, tornado, flood, or
          earthquake, and a severe or unusual hardship would result if the member failed to return home.
    16.18.5. En Route Leave.
          En route leave is ordinary leave members use in connection with PCS, including their first PCS upon
          completion of technical training. Members may request advance leave when they do not have enough accrued
          leave to use as en route leave. Normally, the losing unit commander approves up to 30 days en route leave with
          any PCS move if the leave does not interfere with the reporting date to either a port or new assignment.
          Members who complete basic or technical training may request 10 days of leave en route if their first duty
          station is in the CONUS. They may request 14 days if going to an overseas assignment.
    16.18.6. Terminal Leave.
          Terminal leave is chargeable leave taken in conjunction with retirement or separation from active duty. The
          member‘s last day of leave coincides with the last day of active duty. Normally, a member does not return to
396                                                                                  1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
            duty after terminal leave begins. The amount of leave taken cannot exceed the leave balance at the date of
            separation. See AFI 36-3003 for guidance.
      16.18.7. Excess Leave.
            Excess leave is leave members normally use for personal or family emergency situations when members cannot
            request advance leave. Excess leave is a no-pay status; therefore, entitlement to pay and allowances and leave
            accrual stops on the member‘s first day of excess leave. A member will not receive disability pay, if injured, for
            time spent on excess leave. The period of excess leave will not count toward the fulfillment of any active duty
            service commitment.
      16.18.8. Environmental and Morale Leave (EML).
            EML is leave authorized at overseas installations where adverse environmental conditions require special
            arrangements for leave in desirable places at periodic intervals. The EML taken is ordinary leave. Funded EML
            is charged as ordinary leave, but members are authorized to use DoD-owned or -controlled aircraft; plus, travel
            time to and from the EML destination is not charged as leave. Unfunded EML is also charged as ordinary leave,
            but members are authorized space-available air transportation from the duty locations, and travel time to and
            from the leave destination is charged as leave.
16.19. Regular and Special Passes.
      A pass period is an authorized absence from duty for a relatively short time. It starts from the end of normal work
      hours on a duty day and ends at the beginning of normal work hours the next duty day. There are no mileage
      restrictions. However, approval authorities may require members to be able to return to duty within a reasonable time
      in the event of an operational mission requirement such as a recall, unit alert, or unit emergency.
      16.19.1. Regular Pass.
            A regular pass starts after normal work hours on a given day and stops at the beginning of normal work hours
            the next duty day. This includes nonduty days Saturday, Sunday, and a holiday for up to 3 days total if a
            member normally works Monday through Friday or up to 4 days for a member who works a nontraditional work
            schedule, such as a compressed workweek. The combination of nonduty days and a public holiday may not
            exceed 4 days. DoD or higher management levels may determine that a Monday or Friday is compensatory
            (comp) time off when a holiday is observed on a Tuesday or Thursday, in which case a regular pass may consist
            of a weekend, a comp day off, and a public holiday.
      16.19.2. Special Pass.
            Unit commanders may award 3- or 4-day special passes for special occasions or circumstances, such as
            reenlistment or for some type of special recognition or compensatory time off. They may delegate approval to a
            level no lower than squadron section commander, deputies, or equivalents. Special passes start after normal
            work hours on a given day. They stop at the beginning of normal work hours on either the 4th day for a 3-day
            special pass or the 5th day for a 4-day special pass. A 3-day special pass can be Friday through Sunday,
            Saturday through Monday, or Tuesday through Thursday. A 4-day special pass can be Thursday through
            Sunday or Saturday through Tuesday or Friday through Monday. This applies to a normal Monday through
            Friday workweek. Passes may be taken in conjunction with leave without a duty day between the pass and leave
            period. The pass can be taken before or after leave, but not both. When it is essential to control authorized
            absences for security or operational reasons and other special circumstances, commanders can use DD Form
            345, Liberty Pass, Armed Forces.
16.20. Permissive Temporary Duty (PTDY).
      PTDY is a period of authorized absence limited to attend or participate in a designated official or semi-official
      program for which funded TDY is not appropriate. Commanders may not authorize PTDY in place of leave or a
      special pass or in conjunction with special passes. Normally, AF Form 988 is used for all types of PTDYs. See AFI
      36- 3003 for complete information.
      16.20.1. Authorized PTDYs.
            Types of authorized PTDYs include, but are not limited to:
            16.20.1.1. Traveling to or in the vicinity of a new PDS to secure off-base housing before the member
            outprocesses the old PDS. (Generally, members request PTDY after signing in at the new PDS.)
            16.20.1.2. Accompanying a dependent patient or military member patient to a designated medical treatment
            facility not in the local area when the medical authority deems it essential.
AFPAM36-2241      1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                           397

           16.20.1.3. Traveling to a MAJCOM or AFPC Career Development Division, either as an individual or part of a
           group to discuss career management or to review records.
           16.20.1.4. Attending national conventions or meetings hosted by service-connected organizations such as the
           Air Force Sergeants Association and the Noncommissioned Officers Association.
     16.20.2. PTDY Not Authorized.
           Members are not authorized PTDYs:
           16.20.2.1. To search for a house in a close proximity PCS move.
           16.20.2.2. In conjunction with a permissive reassignment.
           16.20.2.3. To attend a professional military education (PME) graduation when the graduate is a coworker,
           friend, or military spouse.
           16.20.2.4. To attend a change of command or retirement ceremony. Note: The revision of Air Force policy has
           upgraded the status of a retirement ceremony from personal in nature to that of an official function. This official
           recognition of retirement ceremonies offers commanders the opportunity to fund travel for the presiding
           official; however, it does not fund travel for attendees who are not officiating in the ceremonies.
16.21. Post-Deployment/Mobilization Respite Absence (PDMRA):
     16.21.1. PDMRA is in support of the SECDEF utilization of the total force policy. The program applies to creditable
     deployments and mobilizations underway on, or commencing after, 19 January 2007.
     16.21.2. The SECDEF has directed establishment of programs to recognize members who are required to mobilize or
     deploy with a frequency beyond established rotation goals and PDMRA as a new category of administrative absence.
     16.21.3. The concept of operations is to establish a yearly rotation goal of a deployment-to-dwell ratio of 1:2. That is,
     for every 1 year a service member of the active component is deployed he or she must have 2 years at his or her home
     station. The yearly mobilization-to-dwell ratio goal for the Reserve Component is 1:5 years. PDMRA earned under
     these conditions is considered administrative absence.
     16.21.4. For the purpose of accruing PDMRA under this program, the Department of the Air Force defines criteria as
     creditable deployments/TDYs to the land areas of Afghanistan or Iraq. Aircrew participating in missions into, out of,
     within or over the area of eligibility in support of military operations, count each day of operation as 1 day of
     eligibility. Deployment is defined as a member TDY under contingency, exercise, and deployment orders to these
     locations.
     16.21.5. Creditable time continues to accrue during periods of rest and relaxation (R&R), leave, and for TDYs outside
     of Afghanistan or Iraq of 30 consecutive days or less.
16.22. Program Administration:
     16.22.1. Commanders can only delegate ordinary leave approval to the lowest supervisory level to meet the needs of
     the unit. Supervisors should train personnel on the requirements of the leave program and ensure they know how to
     use, LeaveWeb and the AF Form 988 to request leave and PTDY.
     16.22.2. Before approving leave, supervisors should ensure members requesting leave have a sufficient leave balance.
     Also, they must ensure members provide a valid address and emergency telephone number where they can be reached.
     Before signing the AF Form 988, follow the unit‘s procedures to obtain a leave authorization number. Leave numbers
     normally will not be given earlier than 14 days prior to the leave effective date. Members on leave should use risk
     management (RM) principles to assess all hazards and control risks before excessive or hazardous travel, especially
     when traveling by automobiles. Also, supervisors should make sure the member has sufficient funds to return to duty
     on time. If the documentation is not processed digitally, the supervisor sends Part I with authorization number to the
     servicing finance office and gives Part II to the member after obtaining a leave authorization number. The supervisor
     retains Part III for completion after the member returns from leave.
     16.22.3. When the member returns from leave, the supervisor determines how the member‘s actual leave dates
     compared to the first and last days of chargeable leave reported on AF Form 988, Part I. The member signs Part III,
     and the supervisor certifies the dates of leave and sends Part III to the commander support staff for processing. If there
     is a change in the actual number of days the member took, supervisors will follow the instructions listed in Part III.
     Note: The Air Force adopted the current method of recording leave to prevent fraud in the leave reporting system.
398                                                                                    1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
      16.22.4. LeaveWeb is an Air Force system that automates the method of requesting and processing leave (in lieu of
      using the hard copy AF Form 988). Under LeaveWeb, the member requests ordinary leave which generates an e-mail
      to his or her supervisor. The supervisor approves or disapproves the leave and, if approved, sends the leave
      information to the unit leave monitor to validate. Once validated, the leave is sent electronically to finance. The
      member prints a copy of the approved leave form to hand-carry during leave. Upon returning from leave, the member
      completes the necessary updates in LeaveWeb and forwards the e-mail to his or her supervisor for endorsement. This
      electronic process reduces waste in materials as well as man-hours.

Section 16E—Equal Opportunity (EO)
16.23. Equal Opportunity Policy:
      16.23.1. The Air Force is a richly diverse community consisting of Airmen, military and civilian, with widely varied
      backgrounds, beliefs, multicultural influences, and many unique life experiences. Airmen are most effective when they
      are working in an environment that promotes teamwork, inclusion, and mutual respect. Therefore, we must train and
      prepare our Airmen to view human relation issues and circumstances more broadly. This will allow them to effectively
      understand, engage, and defeat any potential adversary or personal situation with intelligence and integrity.
      16.23.2. The EO Program proactively engages all Airmen in the pursuit of equal opportunity. The Air Force EO
      Program has been developed to foster and support equal opportunity, the Air Force Core Values and Airman‘s Creed,
      and must be carried out in the day-to-day actions of all personnel. The Air Force will not tolerate unlawful
      discrimination and unlawful harassment or reprisal against individuals who engage in protected activity. Airmen must
      actively make workplace professionalism a top priority and take proactive steps to prevent, correct and eliminate
      unlawful discriminatory behavior. Air Force EO policy compliance is a function of leadership.
16.24. Equal Opportunity Program Objectives:
      16.24.1. The primary objective of the program is to eradicate unlawful discrimination. The EO office will assist
      commanders at all levels in conducting a continuing campaign to eradicate every form of unlawful discrimination or
      harassment from the workplace. In order to promote a workplace free of unlawful discrimination, to include sexual
      harassment, the EO office will take proactive steps to ensure all available efforts are in place (for example, human
      relations education, commander‘s calls, unit climate assessments).
      16.24.2. The program also seeks to foster a positive human relations environment. The EO office will use the Human
      Relations Climate Assessment Subcommittee (HRCAS) tool to evaluate positive and negative factors in the local
      environment. Human relations education (HRE) is also provided through proactive measures to ensure all employees
      and management personnel understand the need for a positive human relations climate.
16.25. Unlawful Discrimination:
      16.25.1. Unlawful discrimination against military members includes any unlawful action that denies EO to persons or
      groups based on their race, color, religion, national origin, or sex. This type of discrimination can occur in a variety of
      forms to include: in writing, verbal, or in a combination. Unlawful discrimination can occur on or off base.
      16.25.2. Unlawful discrimination against DoD civilian employees includes any unlawful employment practice that
      occurs when an employer fails or refuses to hire or promote, discharges, or otherwise discriminates against any
      individual with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment; or limits, segregates, or
      classifies employees or applicants for employment in any way that deprives or tends to deprive any individual of
      employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affects his/her status as an employee because of race, color, religion,
      national origin, sex, age (40 or older), genetic information, physical or mental disability, or reprisal.
      16.25.3. Unlawful discrimination can also include the use of disparaging terms regarding an individual‘s birthplace,
      ancestry, culture, or the linguistic characteristics common to a specific ethnic group. The use of terms that degrade or
      connote negative statement pertaining to race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, genetic information, and mental
      or physical disability can constitute unlawful discrimination. These terms include insults, printed material, visual
      material, signs, symbols, posters, or insignia.
      16.25.4. The operational language of the Air Force is English. Air Force personnel must maintain sufficient
      proficiency in English to perform their military duties. All official communications must be understood by everyone
      who has a need to know their content. Commanders may require Air Force personnel to use English only when such
      use is clearly necessary and proper for the performance of military duties. Accordingly, commanders, supervisors, and
      managers at all levels must not require the use of English for personal communications unrelated to official duties.
      16.25.5. Although not within the purview of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Air Force‘s goal of
      maintaining a harassment-free environment for its military members and civilian employees also includes harassment
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                           399

      based on sexual orientation. Leaders have a responsibility to take appropriate action to prevent and address harassment
      based on sexual orientation. Additional guidance can be found in Executive Order 11478, Equal Employment
      Opportunity in the Federal Government, and Executive Order 13160, Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Race, Sex,
      Color, National Origin, Disability, Religion, Age, Sexual Orientation, and Status as a Parent in Federally Conducted
      Education and Training Programs, and the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) (http://www.osc.gov) for civilian
      employees. Sexual orientation harassment by military personnel may be punishable under UCMJ, Article 92, and
      should be addressed through command channels.
16.26. Sexual Harassment:
      16.26.1. Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that involves unwelcome sexual advances, requests for
      sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:
            16.26.1.1. Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of a person‘s
            job, pay, or career.
            16.26.1.2. Submission to or rejection of such conduct by a person is used as a basis for career or employment
            decisions affecting this person.
            16.26.1.3. Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual‘s work
            performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.
      16.26.2. This definition emphasizes that workplace conduct, to be actionable as an ―abusive work environment,‖
      harassment need not result in concrete psychological harm to the victim, but rather need only be so severe or pervasive
      that a reasonable person would perceive, and the victim does perceive, the work environment as hostile or offensive.
      Workplace is an expansive term for military members and may include conduct on or off duty, 24 hours a day.
      16.26.3. Any person in a supervisory or command position who uses or condones any form of sexual behavior to
      control, influence, or affect the career, pay, or job of a military member or civilian employee is engaging in sexual
      harassment. Similarly, any military member or civilian employee who makes deliberate or repeated unwelcome verbal
      comments, gestures, or physical contact of a sexual nature in the workplace is also engaging in sexual harassment.
16.27. Military Equal Opportunity Complaint Process:
      16.27.1. Authorization.
            Only military personnel, their family members, and retirees may file military EO complaints. To file a
            complaint, the individual must be the subject of the alleged unlawful discrimination or sexual harassment. Third
            parties, to include commanders, supervisors or co-workers, may not file a complaint on behalf of another
            individual. The EO office will refer all third party individuals who are aware of specific allegations of military
            EO policy violations to their respective chain of command. The EO office will not accept military complaints
            from military members, family members or retirees if their concern is related to their off-base or DoD civilian
            employment.
      16.27.2. Military Informal Complaint Procedures.
            The purpose of the military informal complaint process is to attempt resolution at the lowest possible level.
            16.27.2.1. To informally resolve unlawful discrimination and sexual harassment complaints, individuals may
            orally address or prepare written correspondence to the alleged offender, request intervention by a coworker,
            opt to use the alternate dispute resolution process, or use the chain of command (for example, request assistance
            from the supervisor, first sergeant, or commander).
            16.27.2.2. There is no time limit for filing informal complaints and no requirement for commander approval
            before accepting informal complaints.
      16.27.3. Military Formal Complaint Procedures:
            16.27.3.1. The purpose of the military formal complaint process is to enable military members, retirees and their
            family members to formally present allegations of unlawful discrimination and sexual harassment to the EO
            office with the goal of attempting resolution through a complaint clarification process.
            16.27.3.1.1. Complaint clarification is the process of gathering information regarding a formal military
            complaint or hotline complaint to determine whether a "preponderance of evidence" exists to demonstrate that
            unlawful discrimination or sexual harassment occurred. The complaint clarification includes interviewing or
            taking statements from complainants, potential witnesses, alleged offenders and anyone else who may have
400                                                                                    1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
            information relevant to the case. The EO office may use information gathered from other investigations in
            conjunction with (but not in lieu of) their own clarification process to establish a preponderance of credible
            evidence.
            16.27.3.1.2. The clarification results are forwarded to the Staff Judge Advocate for a legal sufficiency review.
            Once the review is complete, the alleged offender‘s commander receives the complaint for final action, if
            appropriate.
            16.27.3.1.3. The entire complaint clarification process for unlawful discrimination complaints must be
            completed within 20 duty days. This includes 9 duty days for the EO office to conduct a clarification, 6 duty
            days for legal review, and 5 duty days for commander action, if required.
            16.27.3.1.4. Formal sexual harassment complaints must be processed in accordance with 10 U.S.C. Section
            1561, Complaints of Sexual Harassment: Investigation by Commanding Officers. The complaint clarification
            process for sexual harassment complaints must be complete within 14 duty days. This includes 6 duty days for
            the EO office to conduct a clarification, 4 duty days for legal review, and 4 duty days for commander action, if
            required.
            16.27.3.2. Military formal complaints must be filed within 60 calendar days of the alleged offense. The
            installation commander may waive the time limits for good cause based on a memorandum with sufficient
            justification provided by the complainant and submitted through the EO office.
16.28. Civilian Complaint Process.
      Only Air Force employees, former employees, and applicants for employment may file civilian EO complaints. An
      aggrieved person can file a complaint if discriminated against on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin,
      age (40 and older), or disability, or if subjected to sexual harassment or retaliated against for opposing discrimination
      or for participating in the complaint process. Additionally, an employee can file a complaint under Title II of the
      Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) of 2008, which prohibits genetic information discrimination when
      it comes to any aspect of employment, including hiring, firing, pay, job assignments, promotion, layoff, training,
      fringe benefits, or any other term or condition of employment. Under GINA, it is also illegal to harass or retaliate
      against a person because of his or her genetic information.
      16.28.1. Civilian Informal Complaint Procedures:
            16.28.1.1. The purpose of the civilian informal complaint process is to provide for the prompt, fair and impartial
            processing and resolution of complaints, consistent with its legal obligations under Title 29, Code of Federal
            Regulations, Part 1614, Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity. The objective is to seek opportunities
            to resolve issues at the lowest organizational level at the earliest possible time.
            16.28.1.2. The EO office will work with management and the staff judge advocate (SJA) in an attempt to
            resolve the complainant‘s concerns. The EO office must complete the informal complaint process within 30
            calendar days of the complaint being filed unless the complainant grants an extension not to exceed 60
            additional calendar days.
            16.28.1.3. If the matter is not resolved to the complainant‘s satisfaction before the end of the authorized period,
            including extensions, the complainant is issued a notice of right to file a formal complaint.
      16.28.2. Civilian Formal Complaint Procedures:
            16.28.2.1. A formal complaint must be filed at the installation where the alleged discrimination occurred. In
            order for the complaint to be processed at the formal stage, the initial contact must be within 45 calendar days
            of the date of the matter alleged to be discriminatory or, in the case of a personnel action, within 45 calendar
            days of the effective date or when he or she becomes aware of the personnel action. The complaint must
            describe the actions or practices that form the basis of the complaint that was discussed with the EO office
            during the informal complaint process.
            16.28.2.2. The complaint must be filed with the EO director or designee within 15 calendar days of the
            complainant receiving the notice of right to file a formal complaint.
            16.28.2.3. The Air Force is required to process civilian formal EO complaints in accordance with 29 Code of
            Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 1614 and Equal Employment Opportunity Management Directive (EEO MD)
            110. The EEOC requires federal agencies to discharge certain responsibilities once a civilian formal EO
            complaint has been filed.
AFPAM36-2241        1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                         401

             16.28.2.4. The EO office must process all formal complaints expeditiously and make a determination whether to
             accept, dismiss, or partially dismiss a complaint or portion of a complaint to allow for an investigation to be
             completed within 180 calendar days from the date of filing.
16.29. Equal Opportunity and Treatment Incident (EOTI).
      16.29.1. An EOTI is an overt, adverse act, occurring on or off base, directed toward an individual, group, or institution
      which is motivated by or has overtones based on race, color, national origin, religion, or sex which has the potential to
      have a negative impact on the installation human relations climate. An EOTI may include subjects other than military
      members such as retirees and family members.
      16.29.2. The Air Force classifies these incidents as minor, serious, or major based on: the number of participants,
      property damage, physical injury, assault, arson, and/or an act resulting in death. Vandalism (degrading graffiti), hate
      group activity, discriminatory epithets, signs, symbols, or the use of slurs based on race, color, national origin,
      religion, or sex may be classified as an EOTI.

Section 16F—Legal Services
16.30. Legal Office.
      Legal offices ensure Air Force legal readiness through a variety of services. Legal readiness is the state of legal
      preparation in which Air Force members are ready to deploy, both in their personal and mission capacities.
16.31. Personal Legal Readiness.
      On a personal level, legal readiness involves the member‘s awareness of the personal legal issues that may arise in
      preparation for or during a deployment and the remedies available to avoid or lessen any adverse effects of those
      issues. This is usually provided through legal assistance available to Regular Air Force members, reservists, and
      guardsmen on federal active duty, their dependents, and civilian employees stationed overseas and their families.
      Legal assistance for personal civil legal matters includes wills, powers of attorney, notary services, dependent care
      issues, casualty affairs, and landlord-tenant and lease issues.
16.32. Mission Legal Readiness.
      Regarding the mission, legal readiness involves the ability of individuals and their organizations to deal with the
      military-legal aspects of the operational environment. Legal readiness preparation extends from the legal assistance
      provided to Air Force members and their families to the individual knowledge members have of various legal issues
      (for example, the Law of Armed Conflict) and to the operational legal advice provided to military decision makers at
      all levels.
16.33. Complaints of Wrongs Under Article 138, Uniform Code of Military Justice.
      The UCMJ, Article 138, is another provision for protecting individuals‘ rights. Members of the Armed Forces who
      believe they have been wronged by their commanding officers may request redress under the provisions of Article
      138.
      16.33.1. A member may use Article 138 when a discretionary act or omission by his or her commander adversely
      affects the member personally. Examples include acts that violate law or regulation; those that exceed the legitimate
      authority of the commander; ones that are arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion; or those that clearly apply
      administrative standards unfairly. However, the Article 138 complaint system will not provide redress for:
             16.33.1.1. Acts or omissions not initiated or ratified by the member‘s commander (against whom the complaint
             is lodged).
             16.33.1.2. Complaints relating to military discipline under the UCMJ, including Article 15 (other appeal
             systems are provided).
             16.33.1.3. Complaints relating to an action initiated against any Air Force member where the governing
             directive for such action requires that the office of the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) take final action.
             16.33.1.4. Complaints against an officer exercising general court-martial (GCM) jurisdiction for failing to
             resolve Article 138 complaints properly. However, a complaint may be filed for failing to forward a complaint
             to SECAF.
             16.33.1.5. Complaints filed to seek disciplinary action against another.
402                                                                                  1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
      16.33.2. A member who believes himself or herself wronged by the action of his or her commander, before submitting
      a complaint under Article 138, must apply in writing through channels to that commander for redress of the grievance.
      A complaint (in writing) to that commander, or his or her designated representative, is sufficient. Absent unusual
      circumstances, the member must apply for redress within 180 days of the member‘s discovery of the wrong for which
      complained. The complaint should contain all available supporting evidence.
      16.33.3. The commander must send a written response to the member. If the commander refuses a properly submitted
      request for redress, the member may then submit the complaint directly, or through any superior commissioned
      officer, to the officer exercising general court-martial authority (GCMA) over the officer against whom the complaint
      is made. Unless there are unusual circumstances, the member must submit this complaint within 90 days of receiving
      the commander‘s refusal of redress. An intermediate commander or any other superior commissioned officer receiving
      such a complaint will immediately forward the file to the GCMA over the officer against whom the complaint is made.
      The GCMA will conduct or direct further investigation as deemed appropriate and will act based on the facts and
      circumstances of the complaint and any investigation. In all cases, the GCMA must inform the member, in writing, of
      both the action taken on the complaint and the reasons for the action. If the complaint concerns an area that cannot be
      resolved through the Article 138 process, the officer exercising GCM jurisdiction may refer the member to other more
      appropriate complaint channels for possible resolution. Consult AFI 51-904, Complaints of Wrongs Under Article 138,
      Uniform Code of Military Justice, for filing procedures.

Section 16G—Ground Safety
16.34. Mishap Prevention Program:
      16.34.1. Purpose.
            Minimize loss of Air Force resources and protect Air Force people from death, injuries or occupational illnesses
            by managing risk on and off duty. This program applies to all operations except where otherwise prescribed or
            specified in status-of-forces agreements. Continuing to meet this goal is critical to our mission effectiveness.
            The challenge of deployments, technologically advanced combat systems, and changing duty requirements
            demands strong on-duty mishap prevention programs. Off-duty mishap prevention must also adapt to meet the
            challenges posed by motor vehicles, sports and recreation, and other off-duty activities. Every Air Force
            individual has responsibilities in the Mishap Prevention Program.
      16.34.2. Mishap Defined.
            An Air Force mishap is an unplanned event or series of events that results in damage to property; occupational
            illness to Air Force personnel; death or injury to on- or off-duty Air Force military personnel; death or injury to
            on-duty DoD civilian personnel; or damage to public or private property or death, injury, or illness to non-DoD
            personnel caused by DoD activities.
            16.34.2.1. Class A Mishap. The resulting total cost of damages to Government and other property is $2 million
            or more, a DoD aircraft is destroyed (excluding Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Groups 1, 2, or 3), or an
            injury or occupational illness results in a fatality or permanent total disability.
            16.34.2.2. Class B Mishap. The resulting total cost of damages to Government and other property is $500,000
            or more, but less than $2 million. An injury or occupational illness results in permanent partial disability, or
            when three or more personnel are hospitalized for inpatient care (which, for mishap reporting purposes only,
            does not include just observation or diagnostic care) as a result of a single mishap.
            16.34.2.3. Class C Mishap. The resulting total cost of property damages to Government and other property is
            $50,000 or more, but less than $500,000; or a nonfatal injury or illness that results in 1 or more days away from
            work, not including the day of the injury.
            16.34.2.4. Class D Mishap. The resulting total cost of property damage is $20,000 or more, but less than
            $50,000; or a recordable injury or illness not otherwise classified as a Class A, B, or C mishap.
      16.34.3. Mishap Prevention Responsibilities.
            Commanders, functional managers, supervisors, and individuals identify rules, criteria, procedures, and safety
            standards that help eliminate unsafe acts or conditions that cause mishaps. An effective program depends on
            individuals integrating mishap prevention at every functional level and being responsible for complying with
            applicable safety standards.
            16.34.3.1. Safety Office. At the installation level, the host safety staff implements the program for all Air Force
            units on base unless otherwise outlined in a host-tenant support agreement. The ground safety staff consists of
AFPAM36-2241      1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                          403

           career safety professionals who are first term and career Airmen who have retrained into the enlisted safety
           career field (Air Force specialty code (AFSC) 1S0X1), as well as Department of Air Force civilians. With the
           assistance of the commanders, supervisors, and individuals, the staff provides guidance that helps eliminate
           unsafe acts or conditions. Nevertheless, when mishaps occur, the safety staff ensures all mishaps are properly
           investigated and reported. Note: Mishap investigation is for mishap prevention purposes only—not for punitive
           actions.
           16.34.3.2. Commanders. Commanders at all levels are responsible for developing and implementing a mishap
           prevention program.
           16.34.3.2.1. Installation Commanders. Installation commanders provide safe and healthful workplaces for all
           installation employees; ensure leadership at all levels is held accountable for enforcing safety and occupational
           health standards, and chair the installation safety council and/or environmental, safety, and occupational health
           council (ESOHC).
           16.34.3.2.2. Commanders below Installation Level. Commanders below installation level implement a safety
           and health program in their unit or area of responsibility. Where commanders are not authorized full-time safety
           personnel, they will appoint a primary and alternate unit safety representative (USR) to assist them in
           implementing their safety program. They also ensure a proactive mishap prevention program is implemented to
           include procurement and proper use of PPE, and facility compliance with applicable standards.
           16.34.3.3. Supervisors. Supervisors understand and enforce the safety and health standards that apply to their
           areas, operations, and operations involving their subordinates. They use RM techniques to analyze work
           environment and job tasks for hazards; the job safety analysis (JSA) will be used as part of this process. They
           review work processes annually, when new tasks or equipment are added, or when existing tasks change. They
           develop a work center specific job safety training (JST) guide on safety, fire prevention/protection, and health
           requirements. Supervisors will document and maintain completed training in the work area and will conduct and
           document monthly spot inspections of the work areas. They report all mishaps that occur in work areas, off-duty
           mishaps involving assigned personnel, and related subsequent employee absences to the supporting safety office
           and inform the civilian personnel office if a mishap involves a civilian employee.
           16.34.3.4. Individuals. The individual holds a vital role in preventing mishaps. A failure to intervene when a
           potential unsafe act is identified is a failure to protect. Every Air Force member is accountable for considering
           their personal safety and the safety of when participating in off-duty activities as well as during assigned tasks.
           Individuals are responsible to comply with all safety instructions, technical orders, job guides and operating
           procedures. They identify and report hazardous conditions that place Air Force personnel or property at risk;
           use the AF IMT 457, USAF Hazard Report, when necessary. Individuals will report personal injury, property
           damage and any suspected exposure to biological, chemical or nuclear hazardous materials to your supervisor as
           soon as practical, but not to exceed 24 hours. They immediately report to their supervisor if they believe they
           have a physical or mental condition that may impact safe job performance. They will use and maintain
           recommended and appropriate PPE for job tasks.
16.35. Human Factors:
     16.35.1. Overview.
           Human factors (HFAC) is about people in their living and working environments and how interpersonal
           interactions within those environments affect human performance. HFACs have contributed to mishaps
           throughout the history of the Air Force. It is with a systematic analysis of root causes, the application of
           mitigation strategies, and the development of organizational cultures that processes can be identified to interrupt
           a chain of events from becoming a mishap. In order to use HFACs effectively, we must understand the different
           hazards that exist and how to properly mitigate risks along potential pathways to mishaps.

     16.35.2. Root Cause Analysis:
           16.35.2.1. The Air Force uses four levels to determine the root cause of a mishap when dealing with HFACs.
           16.35.2.1.1. Organizational Influences can play the biggest role due to the organizational climate,
           organizational processes, and resource/acquisition management. When a unit has an increased ops tempo during
           a time of limited manning, Air Force members are motivated both internally and from higher headquarters to
           get the mission done. Depending on the culture of the organization, this could be a setup for personnel to
           disregard approved procedures and safety. This can be seen off duty as well in the established culture of a
           family or group of friends. Bending or breaking the rules may be common-place and foster an environment in
404                                                                                 1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
            which it is acceptable to disregard PPE requirements or posted speed limits and encourage actions which would
            distract from safely operating a vehicle.
            16.35.2.1.2. Adverse Supervisory Influences can stem from failure to correct known problems, inappropriately
            planned operations, inadequate supervision, or supervisory violations. If supervision fails to enforce standards
            in the workplace, unsafe acts will occur. Likewise, this level is causal if you allow someone to drink and drive
            or borrow your car knowing that the tires do not have the proper tread depth. Organizational and supervisory
            breakdowns can lead to human error, unsafe conditions, and system failure.
            16.35.2.1.3. Preconditions for unsafe acts consist of the cumulative culture of the organization combined with
            specific events and physical condition of workers. Latent factors include meteorological conditions, the physical
            condition of individuals, and other external and internal emotional personnel factors. For example, a worker
            could be required to work outside without the proper equipment or clothing for the weather conditions leading
            them to rush through a procedure. Another example would be starting leave at the end of the duty day and
            deciding to drive to a distant leave location without getting the proper 8 hours of rest.
            16.35.2.1.4. Lastly, are the Unsafe Acts themselves, which are the active errors or violations, made by the
            individual which complete the mishap event sequence. This may happen when a worker knowingly or
            unknowingly violates published guidance causing an unsafe act to occur. For instance, disregarding proper
            procedures and sticking your hand into a running lawnmower to unclog the discharge shoot. Determining how
            these four levels may influence a chain of events can determine root causes and, more importantly, can aid in
            hazard identification, risk mitigation and proactive safety prevention efforts. The deeper we look at HFACs in
            our work area and personal lives, the more we see the causes and contributing factors as a complex web of
            failures/errors and contributing failures/errors of multiple individuals as well as failures in the ―system.‖
        16.35.2.2. Figure 16.1 is a diagram describing the complex factors that can lead to a mishap. Every mishap has
        strong correlations to previous mishaps. If we know what the failures or ―holes‖ are we can develop controls to
        minimize the risk of similar mishaps happening in the future.

16.36. Accountability.
      We cannot tolerate reckless behavior or unwise decisions. All Airmen must take personal responsibility and be held
      accountable for their actions. Supervisors will ensure military and civilian personnel understand the implications of
      poor decisions and the importance of compliance. Commanders will ensure personnel are aware of Air Force
      instruction requirements and enforce compliance. Violations by military personnel are punishable under the UCMJ
      and may also be considered misconduct during line of duty (LOD) determinations.
      Note: Safety Investigations are for mishap prevention purposes only. However, commanders may direct an additional
      investigation and use factual information (time, speed, weather, etc.) and information obtained elsewhere (witness
      statements, police reports, etc.) for disciplinary purposes (Letter of Reprimand, Line of Duty Determination, Article
      15, etc.).
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                          405

      16.36.1. Potential Impact of LOD Determination.
            A member who is injured due to his or her own misconduct stands to lose substantial benefits. If a member dies
            due to his or her own misconduct, the family stands to lose benefits. Regular pay, disability retirement pay,
            disability severance pay, veterans‘ benefits, and survivor benefit plan payments may be reduced or lost. The
            service member who is permanently disabled due to injury or illness while not in the LOD faces discharge
            without benefits or further medical care.
      16.36.2. How to Protect Yourself and Your Family.
            Think before you act. Driving while under the influence is obvious misconduct. You do not have to be
            intoxicated to be found not in the LOD. Speeding, recklessness, and failure to use PPE can result in injury and
            may lead to disciplinary action. Your career, your family‘s well-being, and most importantly your life depend
            on you making wise decisions.
16.37. Occupational Safety Program:
      16.37.1. Supervisors are responsible for training, establishing work methods and job instructions, assigning jobs, and
      supervising personnel. They are in the best position to identify hazards, assess risks associated with those hazards, and
      correct unsafe work practices or safety deficiencies that would impede mission success.
      16.37.2. One of the greatest influences on successful mission accomplishment is a highly trained workforce that
      recognizes the importance of safety precautions and procedures and adheres to standards incorporating the basic
      elements of risk management.
      16.37.3. Safety training may be integrated into task performance training or conducted separately. Before any
      operation begins and any safety training can take place, the supervisor must determine where people may be injured or
      equipment damaged. A job safety analysis is used to evaluate each work task not governed by a technical order or
      other definitive guidance and when a new work task or process is introduced into the workplace. If unsafe and
      unhealthful working conditions exist, eliminate or control them through engineering, administrative controls, or PPE.
      Commanders must provide PPE for Air Force military members and civilian employees. The use of PPE is appropriate
      only if other controls are not possible or practical for nonroutine use.
      16.37.4. AF Form 55, Employee Safety and Health Record, may be used to document safety, fire protection, and health
      on-the-job training (job safety training). Supervisors must maintain a training outline and document the completion
      dates of initial and refresher (as required) training. All personnel must have job safety training.
16.38. Hazard Identification and Reporting.
      16.38.1. Mishap prevention begins with hazard identification. The top 10 OSHA violations are common in the Air
      Force as well. It is important to realize each Airman can use this list as a tool to improve safety at their worksite:
            16.38.1.1. Fall protection
            16.38.1.2. Scaffolding
            16.38.1.3. Hazard communication
            16.38.1.4. Respiratory Protection
            16.38.1.5. Lockout/Tagout
            16.38.1.6. Electrical-Wiring Methods
            16.38.1.7. Powered Industrial Trucks
            16.38.1.8. Ladders
            16.38.1.9. Electrical-General Requirements
            16.38.1.10. Machine Guarding
      16.38.2. Hazard identification includes understanding and enforcing safety standards. To ensure their safety, the safety
      of their fellow Airmen and the resources entrusted to their care Airmen will:
            16.38.2.1. Stack materials so they may be easily reached but do not protrude into aisles or passageways.
            16.38.2.2. Keep areas around exit doors and passageways free of obstructions. Ensure the exit route leads to a
            public way.
406                                                                                     1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
             16.38.2.3. Remove from service ladders with broken or missing steps, rungs or cleats, broken side rails, or other
             defects.
             16.38.2.4. Ensure attachment plugs of tool and equipment cords are of ―dead front‖ construction: ―Without live
             parts exposed to a person on the operating side of the equipment.‖
             16.38.2.5. When in use, fully insert plugs so no part of the prongs is exposed.
             16.38.2.6. Frequently check the third and/or grounding prong to ensure it is secure, especially on items
             unplugged frequently. Do not cut off the prong, nor use an adapter to allow a three-prong plug to fit a two-
             prong receptacle, since this negates third wire grounding protection.
             16.38.2.7. Ensure circuit breakers, disconnect switches and fuses are readily accessible to workers and building
             management personnel. Keep work space in front clear and unimpeded.
             16.38.2.8. Not tape circuit breakers in the –on position. Breakers that trip frequently indicate electrical problems
             and shall be promptly reported and corrected.
             16.38.2.9. Not run cords through holes in walls, ceilings, floors, doorways, windows, etc.
             16.38.2.10. Only use multi-receptacle surge protectors to power computers and related equipment such as lights
             and or fans.
             16.38.2.11. Not use surge protectors nor extension cords with high current items such as coffee makers,
             refrigerators, microwave ovens, heaters, food preparation equipment, etc.
             16.38.2.12. Keep in good condition electrical outlets, switches, junction boxes, etc. and securely install cover
             plates. Keep outlets, switches, cover plates, etc. free of cracks or defects that could cause them to be ineffective.
             16.38.2.13. Ensure electrical receptacles located within six (6) feet of any water source, e.g., sinks, water
             coolers, water fountains, etc. are GFCI-protected.
             16.38.2.14. Ensure one or more methods of machine guarding is provided to protect the operator and others in
             the machine area from hazards such as those created by point of operation, in-running nip points, rotation parts,
             flying chips, power transmission apparatus and sparks.
      16.38.3. Report hazards to the responsible supervisor or local agency. If the hazard is eliminated on the spot, no further
      action is required; sharing information with other units or agencies may prevent duplicating hazards and deficiencies
      elsewhere and is recommended. If the hazard presents imminent danger, the supervisor or individual responsible for
      that area must take immediate action to correct the situation or apply interim control measures. Report hazards to the
      safety office that cannot be eliminated immediately using AF IMT 457, USAF Hazard Report, by telephone or in
      person. Reports can be submitted anonymously. The safety staff investigates the HR. The investigator discusses the
      HR with the member who submitted the report (if known), the responsible supervisor or manager, and other parties
      involved to validate the hazard and determine the best interim controls and corrective action.
      16.38.4. AF IMT 457 must be readily available to all unit personnel in the work center. The safety office must respond
      within 10 workdays to the reporting member on its findings, status of the AF IMT 457, and any recommendations.
16.39. Traffic Safety:
      16.39.1. Traffic mishaps cause the highest number of Air Force injury-related deaths each year. For this reason, each
      Air Force installation must have an effective traffic safety program as part of its mishap prevention program. The goal
      of the traffic safety program is to prevent or reduce the frequency and severity of vehicular mishaps involving Air
      Force personnel and equipment.
      16.39.2. In order to prevent mishaps, we must first understand the root causes, and then act on that understanding by
      making wise choices. The Air Force Safety Center has analyzed data and identified the top causes of fatal USAF
      mishaps. Reckless behaviors by the operator have accounted for over 70 percent of Personal Motor Vehicle (PMV)
      fatalities in the last 10 years. Reckless behaviors include: speeding or driving too fast for conditions, failure to comply
      with traffic laws (other than speeding), drinking and driving under the influence, and driving without appropriate
      protective equipment (helmets for PMV and nonuse of seatbelts for PMV). Being distracted by nondriving tasks
      (talking on a cell phone, texting, using a navigation device) has become more of an issue in recent years and is
      becoming a focus of PMV mishap prevention efforts.

Section 16H—Risk Management (RM)
16.40. Definition.
      Risk Management (RM) is a decision-making process to systematically evaluate possible courses of action, identify
      risks and benefits, and determine the best course of action (COA) for any given situation. RM enables commanders,
      functional managers, supervisors, and individuals to maximize capabilities while limiting risks through application of
      a simple, systematic process appropriate for all personnel and functions in both on- and off-duty situations.
      Appropriate use of RM increases an organization‘s and individual‘s ability to safely and effectively accomplish their
      mission/activity while preserving lives and precious resources.
      16.40.1. RM Principles.
             Four principles govern all actions associated with the management of risk. These principles, continuously
             employed, are applicable before, during, and after all tasks and operations.
             16.40.1.1. Accept No Unnecessary Risk. All Air Force missions and daily routines inherently involve risk. The
             most logical choices for accomplishing a mission are those that meet all mission requirements while exposing
             personnel and resources to the lowest acceptable risk.
             16.40.1.2. Make Risk Decisions at the Appropriate Level. Making risk decisions at the appropriate level
             establishes clear accountability. Those accountable for the success or failure of the mission must be included in
             the risk decision process.
             16.40.1.3. Integrate RM into Operations and Planning at All Levels. To effectively apply RM, commanders
             must dedicate time and resources to integrate RM principles into planning and operational processes. Risk
             assessments of operations are most supportive when they are performed as a normal way of conducting a
             mission.
             16.40.1.4. Apply the process cyclically and continuously. RM is a continuous process applied across the full
             spectrum of military training and operations, base operations functions, and day-to-day activities and events
             both on and off duty. It is a cyclic process used to continuously identify and assess hazards, develop and
             implement controls, evaluate outcomes, and provide feedback to our Airmen to save lives and preserve combat
             resources.
      16.40.2. RM Levels.
             The principles, goals and fundamental concepts of RM highlight the universal application of RM concepts both
             on- and off-duty. There are two primary levels of RM (deliberate and real-time) that dictate the level of effort
             and scope that should normally be undertaken when evaluating risks. Figure 16.2 depicts the basic relationship
             of these levels and how they relate across the strategic to tactical spectrums. The controls/resources and issues
             shown below the RM levels are examples of resources and impacts that might apply across the planning and
             execution timelines. As the diagram shows, deliberate and real-time RM are interrelated when making RM
             decisions; they are separated only at the point where the planning phase transitions to the execution phase of the
             mission/activity. A strong, effective RM process involves careful and deliberative planning coupled with
             effective, real-time RM. This full spectrum approach ensures comprehensive risk mitigation and the likelihood
             of mission/activity success.
             16.40.2.1. Deliberate RM. Deliberate RM refers to pre-mission/activity planning and involves the full formal
             application of the complete 5-Step RM Process. This process can range from an in-depth planning process
             involving thorough hazard identification, detailed data research, diagram and analysis tools, formal testing, and
             long-term tracking of the risks associated with an operation, activity or system, down to normal day-to-day
             operations/activity planning that use the same 5-Step RM Process, but require less time and resources to
             complete. Generally associated with strategic-level planning, ―in-depth‖ RM planning is reserved for complex
             operations/systems, high priority/high visibility situations or circumstances in which hazards are not well
             understood. In-depth RM is normally implemented well in advance of the planned system, mission, event, or
             activity and is normally reserved for more complex and risky efforts (such as large troop/unit movements,
             airshow planning, system development, tactics and training curricula development, scheduled vacations,
             organized camping/hiking activities, scheduled home repairs, etc.). As the situation, operation, or activity
             becomes less complex, familiar and/or closer to execution, deliberate RM planning becomes simplified and the
             focus shifts to ensuring near-term hazards and mitigation strategies are considered. Across the spectrum of
             deliberate RM, we must always include the experience, expertise, and knowledge of unit personnel to identify
             known hazards/risks and strategies to effectively mitigate risks for the specific mission, activity, or task in both
408                                                                                            1 OCTOBER 2013      AFPAM36-2241
                on- and off-duty situations. Although preplanning is always desired for any situation, we must also consider
                how we deal with RM once we begin the execution phase of an activity.

                            Controls become resources during execution


                16.40.2.2. Real-Time. This level of RM is always associated with RM decisions made in ―real-time‖ during the
                ―execution‖ or tactical phase of training, operations, emergency/crisis response situations, or off-duty activities
                where there is normally little or no time to conduct formal RM planning. It is usually an informal, mental risk
                assessment that is done ―on the fly‖ (for example, short-notice taskings, weather/natural phenomena driven
                activities, emergency responses, spontaneous off-duty activities, etc.) using basic RM process steps to identify
                and mitigate hazards in the new or changing situation. As time is normally constrained or limited in these
                situations, deliberate application of the 5-Step RM Process is impractical. In real-time situations, individuals
                must be able to efficiently and effectively apply RM concepts to mitigate risks. To enhance recall of critical RM
                steps, the Air Force has adopted an easy to remember mnemonic (ABCD discussed in paragraph 16.40.4.) to
                assist personnel in making sound RM decisions during ―real-time.‖ It provides a description of the Air Force
                real-time risk management (RTRM) process that is appropriate during the ―execution‖ of a mission or activity
                and/or time-constrained situations.
          16.40.3. 5-Step RM Process.
                RM is a continuous, systematic decision-informing process consisting of five primary steps (Figure 16.3) that
                define the formal RM process primarily associated with deliberative RM planning and forms the basis for
                RTRM considerations. The following is a brief description of the 5-Step RM Process:
                16.40.3.1. (Step 1) Identify the Hazards. Step one of the process involves application of appropriate hazard
                identification techniques in order to identify hazards associated with the operation or activity. Hazards can be
                defined as any real or potential condition that can cause mission degradation, injury, illness, death, or damage to
                or loss of equipment or property. In the deliberative or strategic/in-depth risk analysis, unit RM experts help
                facilitate the formal risk assessment in collaboration with subject matter experts (SME) for the mission or
                activity being evaluated. This collaboration is essential in identifying all potential hazards as the SMEs
                normally have the greatest insight into the activity and their past experiences and lessons learned are invaluable
                in identifying hazards.

                                                    16.40.3.2. (Step 2) Assess the Hazards. The assessment step involves
                                                   the application of quantitative and/or qualitative measures to determine
                                                   the probability and severity of negative effects that may result from
                                                   exposure to risks/hazards and directly affect mission or activity success.
                                                   Assessing hazards can be a formalized or intuitive process, but it is
                                                   essential to have mission/activity SMEs vetted within this process, to
                                                   provide insight on potential strategies and controls to mitigate the risks
                                                   associated with a particular event. Use of a risk assessment matrix,
                                                   (Figure 16.4) is recommended but not required; Risk Assessment matrix
                                                   tables can take different forms and must be designed to fit the
                                                   organization or situation as warranted. A matrix provides a consistent
                                                   framework for evaluation and shows the relative perceived risk between
                                                   hazards and prioritizes which hazards to control first. Any matrix that
                                                   supports the specific application may be used.
                                                   16.40.3.2.1. Hazard Severity:
                                                   16.40.3.2.1.1. Catastrophic. Complete mission failure, death, or loss of
                                                   system.
            16.40.3.2.1.2. Critical. Significantly degraded mission capability or unit readiness; severe injury or damage.
            16.40.3.2.1.3. Moderate. Minor mission degradation, injury, minor occupational illness, or minor system
            damage.
            16.40.3.2.1.4. Negligible. Less than minor mission degradation, injury, occupational illness, or minor system
            damage
            16.40.3.2.2. Mishap Probability:
            16.40.3.2.2.1. Frequent (A). Highly likely to occur. Expected to occur often to an individual, item or person, or
            continuously to a group.
            16.40.3.2.2.2. Likely (B). Likely to occur immediately or in a short period of time. Expected to occur several
            times to an individual, item or person, or regularly to a group.
            16.40.3.2.2.3. Occasionally (C). Will occasionally occur in time. Reasonably expected to occur sometime to an
            individual, item, or person, or sporadically to a group.
            16.40.3.2.2.4. Seldom (D). May occur in time. May occur sometime to an individual, item, or person, or seldom
            to a group.
            16.40.3.2.2.5. Unlikely (E). Unlikely to occur. Assumed it will not occur in a career, or occurs very rarely to a
            group.
            16.40.3.3. (Step 3) Develop Controls and Make Decisions. Step three involves the development and selection
            of specific strategies and controls that reduce or eliminate risk. Effective mitigation measures reduce one of the
            three components (probability, severity or exposure) of risk. Risk mitigation decisions must be made at the
            appropriate level for the identified risk. The higher the risk, the higher the decision-level needs to be to ensure
            that an appropriate analysis of overall costs to benefits has been carefully weighed. Keep in mind there is no
            ―cookie-cutter‖ approach or specific standard for establishing levels of RM decision authority across the Air
            Force. However, leadership/decisionmakers must ensure that the levels of decision authority are aligned
            appropriately for mission requirements and experience levels of the personnel conducting operations/activities
            under their responsibility. It is possible for decision-levels to vary within a command for differing
            operations/activities if training requirements, mission sets or activities are divergent enough to warrant separate
            standards (for example, AETC, Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), etc.). Decisionmakers must
            ultimately choose the most mission supportive risk controls, consistent with RM principles that provide the best
            solution for the given hazards. Risk decisions must never be delegated to a lower level for convenience or when
            the situation dictates senior-level involvement; exceptions may be considered in time critical situations where
            delays might endanger lives, resources or equipment.

              16.40.3.4. (Step 4) Implement Controls. Once control measures have been selected, an implementation
              strategy must be developed and carried out. The strategy must identify the: who, what, when, where and costs
              associated with the control measure. RM is not about eliminating all of the hazards/risks. It is about carefully
              weighing appropriate options and managing the acceptable risk for a given mission, activity or situation.
              Although it possible for hazards/risks to remain consistent for a given mission or activity, it is more likely for
              circumstances to change over time. This change can drastically affect the overall risk factors associated with a
              mission or activity, causing leaders or other individuals to select alternate risk mitigation strategies than were
              selected in the past. This is why it is essential for leaders to remain in the loop on changes, and provide
              guidance on acceptable levels of risk and who can approve or deny specific actions based upon current
              circumstances/limitations. For mission-related controls, accountability must be emphasized across all levels of
              leadership and personnel associated with the action so that there is clear understanding of the risks and
              responsibilities of commanders and subordinates alike. There must always be accountability for acceptance of
              risk regardless of circumstances. Incorporate selected controls into standard operating procedures, instruction
              letters, orders, briefs, training, and rehearsals. Communicate selected controls to the lowest level.
              16.40.3.5. (Step 5) Supervise and Evaluate. RM is a process that continues throughout the life cycle of a
              system, mission, or activity. Leaders and supervisors at every level must fulfill their respective roles to ensure
              controls are sustained over time. Once controls are in place, the process must be periodically reevaluated to
              ensure controls remain effective and mission supportive over time. A review by itself is not enough; a feedback
              system must be established to ensure that the corrective or preventative action taken was effective and that any
              newly discovered hazards identified during the mission/activity are analyzed and corrective action taken.
              Feedback informs all involved as to how the implementation process is working and whether or not the controls
              were effective. Feedback can be in the form of briefings, lessons learned, cross-tell reports, benchmarking,
              database reports, etc. Without this feedback loop, we lack the benefit of knowing if the previous forecasts were
              accurate, contained errors, or were completely incorrect. Commanders, supervisors, and individuals must work
              with appropriate RM process managers, instructors, advisors, and facilitators to ensure effective RM feedback
              and cross tell is collected and distributed to enhance future operations and activities.

      16.40.4. Real-Time RM (RTRM) Process or ABCD Model.
            The 5-Step RM Process is the cornerstone of all RM decisions and lays the framework for conducting
            formalized risk assessments normally associated with the deliberative level of RM. Although RTRM is also
            founded on the 5-Step RM Process, streamlining the steps is essential in situations where risk decisions need to
            be made quickly and in real-time. The RTRM process or ABCD model provides individuals with an easy to
            remember mnemonic that walks them through the essential steps of the RM wheel to: ―Assess the situation,
            Balance controls, Communicate, and Decide and Debrief the RM decision: ABCD.‖ This simple and easy to
            remember memory jogger provides individuals with a means to evaluate risks and formulate mitigation
            strategies in a short time and can be easily applied in both on- and off-duty situations. Figure 16.5 provides a
            graphic example of the relationship between the 5-Step RM Process and RTRM using the ABCD model.
Figure 16.5. The 5-Step RM Process as related to the RTRM/ 16.40.4.1. Assess the Situation. Assessing risk in a
ABCD Model.                                                     time-critical environment typically occurs when a
                                                        planned activity is already underway or when the complexity or
                                                        perception of overall risk is low. Effective assessment requires
                                                        the key elements of hazard/risk identification and understanding
                                                        the negative effects associated with those hazards/risks.
                                                        Individuals must seriously consider the activity or action in
                                                        which they are about to engage and choose appropriate
                                                        mitigation strategies to meet the hazards they identify. In
                                                        RTRM, a complete assessment of the situation requires three
                                                        stages of situational awareness (SA) in a relatively short time:
                                                        (a) perception of what is happening; (b) integration of
                                                        information and goals; and (c) projection into the future. Unlike
                                                        strategic or deliberate RM, where there is ample time to assess
                                                        potential situations, an individual‘s ability to discern the
                                                        situation and apply available resources quickly and effectively
                                                        can mean the difference between success or failure. This first
                                                        step of the RTRM/ABCD model effectively combines the first
                                                        two steps of the 5-Step RM Process.
                                                              16.40.4.2. Balance Controls. The second step of the
                                                              RTRM/ABCD model is specifically tied to making risk control
                                                              decisions (step three of the 5-Step RM Process) to mitigate or
                                                              eliminate the risks identified in assessing the hazards of the
            activity. After assessing the situation, personnel must consider all available controls (resources) to facilitate
            mission or activity success and how to manage them effectively. Controls/resources can vary in scope and
            availability from situation to situation. The better prepared individuals are prior to an activity, the more likely
            they will have more controls/resources available to create multiple redundancies or ―blocks‖ to effectively
            eliminate or mitigate potential risks in real-time. As an example, this equates to having a good understanding of
            the situation, being properly trained, wearing correct PPE, knowing personal limitations, and having a
            ―Wingman‖ to support their efforts. Each of these controls/resources serves as a layer of protection and
            enhances a decisionmaker‘s ability to effectively balance risk versus reward through proper preparation and
            understanding of the situation and options. When making these considerations, Airmen must communicate with
            their team and leadership to ensure all options and resources are effectively used in making a sound, yet timely
            risk decision.
            16.40.4.3. Communicate. The third step of the RTRM/ABCD model is to communicate. This communication
            can take various forms such as real-time communication with leadership to discuss problems and/or intentions,
            internal team/crew communication to discuss real-time hazards and mitigation options, or an individual
            internalizing their current situation and taking time to evaluate if they are heading down the right path. This step
            assumes individuals and/or teams carefully consider options and controls available to them in real-time
            situations, and that they are aware of how perception and communication skills change in unanticipated and
            changing environments. Perception and communication skills are adversely affected as individuals become
            increasingly stressed and lose situational awareness (SA). Feeling undo pressure to succeed or to continue with
            a plan when anticipated conditions require ―mid-stream‖ changes can have similar effects on individuals and/or
            team members as they try to compensate. In these high stress situations, communication skills diminish as
            individuals channelize attention and lose awareness of the overall situation; they can experience tunnel vision
            and be unable to multitask effectively to deal with the changing circumstances. Understanding this, individuals
412                                                                                     1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
            and teams who are thrust into these situations can better prepare, anticipate, and identify if they or others are
            losing SA and make corrections. This awareness enables individuals to more effectively communicate with
            teammates and leadership in real-time situations, and allows them to take a step back and reevaluate options.
            Asking questions such as: ―Who needs to know about the situation?‖ ―Who can help or assist?‖ ―Who can
            provide backup?‖ or ―Can this be done differently?‖ are just a few examples of the considerations that must be
            made prior to implementing a mitigation strategy in real-time.
            16.40.4.4. Decide and Debrief:
            16.40.4.4.1. The final step of the RTRM/ABCD model is to make the decision to continue, modify or abandon
            the mission/activity based upon real-time circumstances and conditions. Unlike step 4 of the 5-Step RM Process
            where an implementation strategy is carefully developed and carried out through identification of the who,
            what, when, where and cost associated with the control prior to an activity, RTRM relies on the individual or
            small group taking immediate or near immediate action to mitigate risks in real-time. This aspect alone can
            make RTRM decisions riskier than deliberate RM decisions. Individuals must realize this and make every effort
            to deliberately weigh risk decisions before taking action to ensure they are selecting the best course of action
            (COA). Sometimes the original plan must be modified or changed to account for unforeseen issues in order to
            assure success. Although minor changes or modifications to a plan or strategy may be easily implemented,
            others may require higher authority (if available) to properly weigh the risk and determine the best COA.
            Accountability under these circumstances rests solely with the individuals involved in the activity and it is their
            responsibility to fully understand the scope and limits of their go/no-go decision and act accordingly. As such,
            the acceptance of risk and associated consequences needs to be taken seriously with the understanding that any
            adverse outcome from a selected COA may not only affect the individual, but greatly impact loved ones, co-
            workers, and ultimately their valuable contribution to the Air Force mission. Although the goal for any mission
            or activity is to operate safely and achieve success, all Airmen must consider the possibility of abandoning the
            mission or activity if the situation appears too risky or too costly to continue and there are no reasonable options
            or strategies to change/alter the circumstances in the time remaining to conduct the mission/activity.
            16.40.4.4.2. As with the formal 5-Step RM Process, both leadership and personnel involved in a
            mission/activity must ensure that the feedback loop or ―debrief‖ aspect of the ―D‖ is performed. This vital
            process step ensures individuals follow through and complete the ABCD mnemonic loop by identifying what
            worked, what did not work, and ensures documented lessons learned are disseminated. Debriefs will improve
            performance, mitigate risks in future activities, and are essential in completing the ABCD loop. Asking
            questions such as: ―Was our assessment accurate?‖ ―Were we lucky?‖ ―How well did we use the
            controls/resources?‖ ―Was the communication effective?‖ and ―What can we do to improve the events in the
            future?‖ are a few examples of questions that leaders, crews/teams, and individuals can ask in debriefs to ensure
            future activities are improved and risks are reduced.

Section 16I—Sexual Assault
16.41. Air Force Policies and Procedures for Prevention of and Response to Sexual Assault:
      16.41.1. Sexual Assault Is a Crime.
            Sexual assault is criminal conduct and it violates the Air Force core values. Inherent in our core values of
            integrity first, service before self, and excellence in all we do is respect: self-respect, mutual respect, and respect
            for our Air Force as an institution. Sexual assault corrodes the very fabric of our Wingman culture. Therefore,
            we must strive for an environment where this type of behavior is not tolerated, and all Airmen are respected.
      16.41.2. Sexual Assault.
            The following definition of sexual assault has been defined by DoD and is for education and training purposes
            only. This definition does not affect in any way the definition of any offense under the UCMJ. Commanders are
            encouraged to consult with their SJA for complete understanding of this definition in relation to the UCMJ.
            Sexual assault is defined as intentional sexual contact, characterized by use of force, threats, intimidation,
            abuse of authority, or when the victim does not or cannot consent. Sexual assault includes rape, forcible
            sodomy (oral or anal sex), and other unwanted sexual contact that is aggravated, abusive, or wrongful (to
            include unwanted and inappropriate sexual contact), or attempts to commit these acts.
            ―Consent‖ means words or overt acts indicating a freely given agreement to the sexual conduct at issue by a
            competent person. An expression of lack of consent through words or conduct means there is no consent. Lack
            of verbal or physical resistance or submission resulting from the accused‘s use of force, threat of force, or
            placing another person in fear does not constitute consent. A current or previous dating relationship by itself or
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                          413

            the manner of dress of the person involved with the accused in the sexual conduct at issue shall not constitute
            consent.
16.42. Installation Sexual Assault Response Coordinator (SARC).
      The SARC implements and manages the installation-level sexual assault prevention and response programs. The
      SARC reports directly to the installation vice commander.
      16.42.1. The SARC is the installation‘s single point of contact for integrating and coordinating sexual assault victim
      care from an initial report of sexual assault through disposition and resolution of issues related to the victim‘s health
      and well-being.
      16.42.2. The SARC is also responsible for assisting commanders in meeting annual sexual assault prevention and
      response training requirements, including newcomer and orientation briefings, and will provide community education
      regarding available sexual assault prevention and response services. The SARC maintains, compiles, and submits
      reports required by Air Force and/or DoD directives. The SARC ensures available avenues of reporting sexual assault
      receive the widest possible publicity. These avenues include restricted and unrestricted reports, explained below in
      detail.
16.43. Victim Advocate (VA).
      Air Force VAs provide essential support, liaison services, and care to the victim. Responsibilities include providing
      crisis intervention, referral, and ongoing nonclinical support, including information on available options and resources
      to assist the victim in making informed decisions about the case. VA services will continue until the victim states
      support is no longer needed, or the SARC determines that services are no longer required.
      16.43.1. VAs are volunteers who must possess the maturity and experience to assist in a very sensitive situation. Only
      Regular Air Force military personnel, Reserve, or National Guard personnel in active status, and DoD civilian
      employees selected by the SARC may serve as VAs.
      16.43.2. VAs may accompany the victim, at the victim‘s request, during investigative interviews and medical
      examinations. However, the VA and the victims whom they accompany must be made aware that the VA‘s presence at
      an interview could later result in the VA being called as a witness in court-martial or administrative proceedings.
16.44. Response to a Sexual Assault Incident.
      Upon notification, the SARC will immediately assign a VA to the victim. The assigned VA will immediately contact
      the victim. Unless VA assistance is declined, the VA will provide the victim accurate information on the sexual assault
      response process, including the option of unrestricted or restricted reporting, as applicable. The VA will inform the
      victim of the availability of healthcare, including the option of a forensic medical examination and the collection of
      evidence.
16.45. Confidentiality and Restricted Reporting:
      16.45.1. Sexual assault is the most underreported violent crime in the military and American society. Although the
      victim‘s decision to report is a crucial step following a sexual assault, reporting is often precluded by the victim‘s
      desire that no one know what happened.
      16.45.2. The DoD has directed the implementation of confidentiality in the form of a restricted reporting option that
      enables military members to report allegations of sexual assault to specified personnel, without triggering an
      investigation. This reporting option gives the individual access to medical care, counseling, and a VA, but does not
      initiate the investigative process.
      16.45.3. DoD and the Air Force are committed to ensuring that victims of sexual assault are protected, treated with
      dignity and respect, and provided support, advocacy, and care. Our policy strongly supports effective command
      awareness and prevention programs, as well as law enforcement and criminal justice activities that maximize
      accountability and prosecution of anyone guilty of sexual assault. To achieve these objectives, we recommend prompt,
      complete, unrestricted reporting of sexual assault allegations to activate victim services and accountability responses.
      Victims should be appropriately encouraged to make unrestricted reports. However, the DoD recognizes significant
      barriers exist that deter some victims from reporting sexual assaults.
      16.45.4. Restricted reporting is intended to give a victim additional time and increased control over the release and
      management of the victim‘s personal information and to empower the victim to seek relevant information and support
      to make an informed decision about participating in the criminal process. A victim who receives appropriate care and
      treatment and is provided an opportunity to make an informed decision about filing an unrestricted report with law
414                                                                                  1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
      enforcement or command authorities is more likely to develop increased trust that the victim‘s needs are a primary
      concern.
16.46. Making a Restricted Report.
      Restricted reporting is available only to military personnel of the armed forces. Military personnel include Regular Air
      Force members and members of the Air Force Reserve or the Air National Guard performing active or inactive duty
      training in federal [Title 10] status. Members of the Reserve Component not performing federal duty are not eligible.
      Retired members of any component are not eligible. Dependents and Air Force civilian employees are not eligible.
16.47. Receiving a Restricted Report.
      Only SARCs, VAs, and healthcare providers may receive restricted reports of sexual assault. A VA who is contacted
      by a victim wishing to make a restricted report but who has not been assigned by the SARC to serve as the VA for that
      individual will not enter into a discussion of the circumstances but will immediately refer the victim to the SARC.
      Healthcare providers will provide appropriate emergency medical care and immediately notify the SARC to initiate the
      restricted reporting process. The AFI 44-102, Medical Care Management, requirement to report incidents of sexual
      assault to the AFOSI or other authorities, as appropriate, is expressly waived for restricted reports.
16.48. Notification to Command of a Restricted Report:
      16.48.1. Within 24 hours of receipt of a restricted report of an alleged sexual assault, the SARC will notify the wing
      vice commander that a restricted report has been made. The SARC will provide only the following information while
      ensuring that the information is not sufficient to identify the victim or incident: (1) when the assault occurred, using
      one of the following three categories: while the victim was in military service and within the last 30 days; while the
      victim was in military service and more than 30 days ago; or prior to military service; (2) whether the assault occurred
      during the night (1800–0559) or day (0600–1759); (3) general information as to location (on or off installation); (4)
      number of alleged assailants; (5) number of alleged victims; and (6) nature of assault (rape, forcible sodomy, indecent
      assault, etc.).
      16.48.2. Because non-identifying information under the restricted reporting option is intended to provide commanders
      with general environmental information, neither commanders nor law enforcement officials may initiate investigations
      based on information about restricted reports provided by SARCs. Commanders, however, may use the information to
      enhance preventive measures, to enhance the education and training of their personnel, and to more closely scrutinize
      their organization‘s climate and culture for contributing factors.
16.49. Unrestricted Report:
      16.49.1. Any report of a sexual assault made through normal reporting channels, including the victim‘s chain of
      command, law enforcement, and the AFOSI or other criminal investigative service is considered an unrestricted report.
      Any report of sexual assault made through the SARC, VA, or healthcare personnel by individuals not eligible for
      restricted reporting will be treated as an unrestricted report and forwarded to the AFOSI.
      16.49.2. The SARC will be notified of any unrestricted report and will assign a VA to the individual. Details of the
      allegation will be provided only to those personnel who have a legitimate need to know.
16.50. Use of Information:
      16.50.1. In cases of an unrestricted report of a sexual assault or information concerning a sexual assault is otherwise
      known, information concerning the victim and the offense will only be provided to governmental entities or persons
      with an established official need to know. Those who are deemed to have an official need to know in the Air Force
      routinely include: law enforcement; the commanders and first sergeants of the victim and the alleged assailant; legal
      personnel; the SARC and VA; and healthcare providers as required to perform their respective duties. The intent of
      this restriction is to protect the privacy of the victim.
      16.50.2. Commanders notified of a sexual assault through unrestricted reporting must take immediate steps to ensure
      the victim‘s physical safety, emotional security, and medical treatment needs are met and that the AFOSI or
      appropriate criminal investigative agency and SARC are notified. The appropriate commanders should determine
      whether temporary reassignment or relocation of the victim or alleged assailant is appropriate.
16.51. Addressing Victim Collateral Misconduct in Sexual Assault Cases.
      An investigation into the facts and circumstances surrounding an alleged sexual assault may produce evidence that the
      victim engaged in misconduct like underage drinking or other related alcohol offenses, adultery, drug abuse,
      fraternization, or other violations of instructions, regulations, or orders. According to the UCMJ, the Manual for
AFPAM36-2241         1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                    415

      Courts-Martial, and Air Force instructions, commanders are responsible for ensuring victim misconduct is addressed
      in a manner that is consistent and appropriate to the circumstances.
16.52. Prevention and Response for the Deployed Environment:
      16.52.1. According to DoD policy, deploying members will receive training on sexual assault issues before departing
      for deployment.
      16.52.2. The Air Force will identify trained military SARCs (and/or trained civilian SARCs who volunteer) for air and
      space expeditionary force (AEF) rotational support for global contingency operations consistent with requirements
      established by a commander of Air Force forces. Normally, each air expeditionary wing will warrant at least one
      SARC requirement. For deployments smaller than an AEF, deployed commanders must provide a sexual assault
      response capability consistent with DoD and Air Force requirements.
16.53. Conclusion.
      This chapter discussed some of the aspects of wing support including the Air Force Portal, military pay and
      allowances, leave management, LeaveWeb, military equal opportunity, legal services, ground safety, risk
      management, and policies and procedures for prevention of and response to sexual assault. Supervisors need to ensure
      their Airmen understand the value of applying the knowledge outlined in this chapter.

                                              DRESS AND APPEARANCE
Section 17A—Overview
17.1. Introduction.
      The Air Force uniform developed slowly into what is worn today. During this evolution, the uniform design changed
      from one with many devices and accouterments to one with very few embellishments. The present Air Force uniform
      with its authorized badges, insignia, and devices is plain yet distinctive, presenting the appearance of a military
      professional. Wearing the Air Force uniform means carrying on a tradition—one that identifies the person as a
      member of a historical profession, a close-knit society, quietly assured of his or her competence and professionalism.
      This chapter identifies the most common uniform items and combinations for enlisted members. Note: Consult AFI
      36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel, for official guidance. For promotion testing, this
      chapter is applicable only to personnel testing for promotion to SSgt or TSgt.

Section 17B—Dress and Appearance
17.2. Individual Responsibilities.
      All Air Force members in uniform will adhere to standards of neatness, cleanliness, safety, uniformity, military image,
      and present the appearance of a disciplined service member. Air Force members will procure and maintain all
      mandatory clothing items, follow local supplements and procedures, and keep uniforms neat, clean, pressed, buttoned,
      and properly maintained. Members will not stand or walk with hands in pockets of any uniform combination (other
      than to insert or remove items). While walking in uniform use of personal electronic media devices, including ear
      pieces, speaker phones or text messaging is limited to emergencies or when official notifications are necessary.
      Military customs and courtesies take precedence. (Exception: Ear pieces are authorized during individual physical
      training (PT) when wearing the PT uniform.) Air Force members will not smoke or use smokeless tobacco products,
      drink, or eat while walking in uniform. This also applies when Airmen are required to wear civilian clothes to perform
      assigned duties.
17.3. When to Wear the Uniform:
      17.3.1. Military Duties.
             Air Force members must wear a uniform while performing military duties. Installation commanders will
             provide (at no cost) to enlisted members required organizational and functional items directed for wear. When
             members perform duty on other services‘ installations, they must comply with order of dress for that service,
             provided their standards are not less restrictive than the Air Force.
      17.3.2. Traveling.
             Wearing a uniform is optional when a member is departing from a military airfield on Department of Defense
             aircraft or U.S. government commercial contracted flights. Those who choose to wear civilian clothing will
             ensure items are neat, clean, and appropriate for inflight operations, the mode of travel, and the destination.
             Examples of inappropriate clothing include: ripped, torn, frayed, or patched clothing; tank tops, shorts, short
             skirts, undergarments worn as outer garment, bathing suits, and any garments which are revealing or display
             obscene, profane, or lewd words or drawings. The Airman battle uniform (ABU) is acceptable when traveling
             between military installations.
17.4. Uniform Wear Restrictions.
      Airmen will not wear uniform items that do not meet Air Force specifications. Additionally, Air Force members may
      not wear uniform items to further political activities; for private employment or commercial interests; while
      participating in public speeches, interviews, picket lines, marches or rallies; or at any public demonstration when the
      perception may exist that the Air Force sanctions the cause.
17.5. Personal Grooming Standards:
      17.5.1. Hair.
             Hair will be clean, well-groomed, and neat. If dyed, hair will look natural. Hair will not contain an excessive
             amount of grooming aids, touch the eyebrows, or protrude below the front band of properly worn headgear.
             Exception: Hair may be visible in front of the women‘s flight cap.
418                                                                                  1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
            17.5.1.1. Men. Men‘s hair must have a tapered appearance on the sides and back, both with and without
            headgear. Hair will not exceed 1 1/4 inches in bulk, regardless of length, and will not exceed 1/4 inch at the
            natural termination point. Hairstyles that are extreme, faddish, or violate safety requirements are not permitted.
            Men‘s hair will not touch the ears; only closely cut or shaved hair on the back of the neck may touch the collar.
            The block cut is permitted with tapered appearance. Men are also authorized cleanly shaven heads, military
            high-and-tight, or flat-top haircuts. Men will not have any visible items in, or attached to, their hair.
            17.5.1.2. Women. Women must style their hair to present a professional appearance. Hair will not be worn in
            an extreme or faddish style, or violate safety requirements. Hair cannot extend below an invisible line drawn
            parallel to the ground at the bottom edge of the shirt collar, regardless of length. Hairstyles may include wear of
            conservative hairpins, combs, headbands, elastic bands, and barrettes. However, wear of a ―scrunchy‖ is
            prohibited. Women may not have shaved heads, military high-and-tight, or flat-top haircuts. Minimum length is
            1 inch, and hair will not exceed 3 inches in bulk. Hairpins and bands must match hair color. Long hair worn in a
            bun will be secured with no loose ends. When hair is in a pony tail, it must be pulled all the way through the
            elastic band, hang naturally downward, and not extend below the collar. Bangs, if worn, will not touch the
            eyebrows.
            17.5.1.3. Wigs and Hairpieces. Wigs and hairpieces must meet the same standards required for natural hair.
            They must be of good quality, fit properly, and not exceed limits stated for natural hair. Personnel engaged in
            aircraft flightline or inflight operations are not authorized to wear wigs or hairpieces.
      17.5.2. Beards, Mustaches, and Sideburns (Men):
            17.5.2.1. Beards are not worn except when authorized by a commander, on the advice of a medical official, for
            health reasons. If authorized by the commander, members must keep facial hair trimmed not to exceed 1/4 inch
            in length. If granted a shaving waiver, members will not shave any facial hair. Commanders and supervisors
            will monitor treatment progress to control shaving waivers.
            17.5.2.2. Mustaches, if worn, will not extend downward beyond the lip line of the upper lip or extend sideways
            beyond a vertical line drawn upward from both corners of the mouth.
            17.5.2.3. Sideburns, if worn, will be neatly trimmed and tapered in the same manner as the haircut. They will be
            straight and of even width (not flared) and end in a clean-shaven horizontal line. They will not extend below the
            lowest part of the exterior ear opening.
      17.5.3. Cosmetics (Women).
            Cosmetics must be conservative and in good taste and will not be worn in field conditions.
      17.5.4. Fingernails.
            Fingernails must be clean, well-groomed, not exceed 1/4 inch in length past tip of finger, and not interfere with
            duty performance or hinder proper fit of prescribed safety equipment or uniform items.
      17.5.5. Nail Polish (Women).
            When worn, nail polish will be a single color that complements skin tone. Bright red, orange, purple, black, and
            other extreme colors are not authorized. Decorations are prohibited, but French manicures are authorized.
17.6. Tattoos and Brands:
      17.6.1. Unauthorized Types.
            Tattoos and brands, anywhere on the body, that are obscene or advocate sexual, racial, ethnic, or religious
            discrimination are prohibited in and out of uniform. Tattoos and brands that are prejudicial to good order and
            discipline or of a nature that tends to bring discredit upon the Air Force are prohibited in and out of uniform.
      17.6.2. Inappropriate Types.
            Excessive tattoos and brands must not be exposed or visible (includes being visible through the uniform) while
            in uniform. Excessive is defined as any tattoo or brand that exceeds 1/4 coverage of the exposed body part and
            those above the collarbone and readily visible when wearing an open-collar uniform.

            17.6.3.1. Unauthorized. Any member who obtains unauthorized tattoos will be required to remove them at his

            involuntary separation.
            17.6.3.2. Inappropriate. Members are not allowed to display excessive tattoos that would detract from an
            appropriate professional image while in uniform. Commanders will use AFI 36-2903 to assist in determining
            appropriate military image and acceptability of tattoos displayed by members in uniform. Air Force members
            with existing tattoos that do not meet standards must keep them completely covered using current uniform items
            (for example, long-sleeved shirt or blouse, pants or slacks, dark hosiery, etc.) or volunteer to remove tattoos.
            Depending on the circumstances, commanders may seek Air Force medical support for voluntary tattoo
            removal. Members who do not comply with these requirements are subject to disciplinary action.

            sensitivities (e.g., overseas). Additionally, MAJCOM/CCs may impose more restrictive standards on those

Section 18A—Overview
18.1. Introduction.
      Air Force members must be physically fit to support the Air Force mission. Health benefits from an active lifestyle
      will increase productivity, optimize health, and decrease absenteeism while maintaining a higher level of readiness.
      The goal of the fitness program is to motivate all members to participate in a year-round physical conditioning
      program that emphasizes total fitness, to include cardiorespiratory fitness, strength and endurance, and flexibility
      conditioning and body composition, as well as healthy eating habits. Commanders and supervisors must incorporate
      fitness into the AF culture to establish an environment for members to maintain physical fitness and health to meet
      expeditionary mission requirements and deliver a fit-and-ready force. The annual fitness assessment provides
      commanders with a tool to assist in the determination of overall fitness of their military personnel. This chapter covers
      the fitness program, proper nutrition, substance abuse, tobacco use, suicide prevention, posttraumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD), reintegration from deployment, medical care, and the Wingman concept.

Section 18B—Physical Fitness and Fitness Components
18.2. Physical Fitness, Optimal Performance and Mission Readiness
      Being physically fit is more than just passing the AF Fitness Assessment. Adequate physical fitness levels ensure that
      every Airman can properly support the Air Force mission while performing at optimal capacity. The goal of the fitness
      program is to motivate all members to participate in a year-round physical conditioning program that emphasizes total
      fitness to include proper aerobic conditioning, muscular fitness training and healthy eating. An active lifestyle will
      increase productivity, optimize health, and decrease absenteeism while maintaining a higher level of readiness.
18.3. Physical Fitness.
      The five major components of fitness are cardiorespiratory endurance, body composition, muscular strength, muscular
      endurance, and flexibility. Warm-up and cool down are also essential components of a complete physical fitness
      program.
      18.3.1. Aerobic fitness, synonymous with cardiorespiratory endurance, is the ability to perform large muscle, dynamic,
      moderate-to-high intensity exercise for prolonged periods.
      18.3.2. Body composition is the relative portion of the body comprised of fat and fat-free tissue.
      18.3.3. Muscular strength is the maximum force generated by a specific muscle or muscle group.
      18.3.4. Muscular endurance is the ability of a muscle group to execute repeated contractions over a period of sufficient
      time duration to cause muscular fatigue.
      18.3.5. Flexibility is the maximum ability to move a joint freely, without pain, through a range of motion.
18.4. Aerobic Fitness.
      A successful cardiovascular exercise program should include the principles of frequency, intensity, duration, and
      mode. The design of a cardiovascular exercise program, based on these principles, should be incorporated with the
      desired end goal in mind.
      18.4.1. Frequency.
             Frequency refers to how often one exercises. Conditioning the cardiorespiratory system can be accomplished by
             three adequately intense workouts per week. Airmen should do these on alternate days. By building up
             gradually, Airmen can get even greater benefits from working out five times a week. However, leaders should
             recognize the need for recovery between hard exercise periods and should adjust the training intensity
             accordingly. They must also be aware of the danger of overtraining and recognize that the risk of injury
             increases as the intensity and duration of training increases.
      18.4.2. Intensity.
             Intensity refers to how hard one exercises. Improvements in cardiovascular fitness are directly related to how
             hard the exercise is performed. The minimum training intensity required in an exercise session is 50 percent of
             volume of oxygen (VO2) max, sometimes referred to as the ―training threshold.‖ The heart rate, which
             corresponds to the intensity sufficient for cardiorespiratory improvement, is known as the target heart rate
426                                                                                        1 OCTOBER 2013   AFPAM36-2241
             (THR). A THR of 70 to 90 percent of one‘s theoretical maximum heart rate (MHR) is equivalent to 50 to 85
             percent of one‘s VO2 max. One way to determine THR is to calculate 70 to 90 percent of one‘s theoretical
             MHR using the formula in Figure 18.1.
      18.4.3. Duration.
             Duration is the time spent exercising with the most benefit occurring in the THR zone. Low intensity exercise
             requires longer duration for cardiovascular improvements. The more intense the activity, the shorter the time
             needed to produce or maintain the training effect.
      18.4.4. Mode.
             Only sustained activities that require a large volume of exercise and use large muscle groups will improve
             cardiovascular fitness. Examples are running, rowing, jogging, vigorous walking, jump rope, stationary cycling,
             swimming, and stair climbing.
Figure 18.1. Heart Rate Formula.
 220 - age = maximum heart rate (MHR)
 MHR x .70 = percent of MHR (bottom threshold of target heart rate [THR])
 MHR x .90 = percent of MHR (top threshold of THR)
 As an example, a 30-year old‘s THR would be:
 1. 220 - 30 = 190
 2. 190 x .70 = 133 beats per minute (or 70 percent of MHR)
 3. 190 x .90 = 171 beats per minute (or 90 percent of MHR)
 This individual‘s THR is 133-171 beats per minute. A beginner should target the lower
 end of the heart rate range and increase as improvements occur. To determine heart rate
 for 1 minute, count the pulse for 10 seconds and multiply by 6.

18.5. Muscular Strength and Endurance Training.
      A successful strength and endurance training program should include the principles of specificity, regularity, recovery,
      balance, and variety.
      18.5.1. Principle of Specificity.
             A strength training program should provide resistance to specific muscle groups that need to be strengthened.
             These groups can be identified by doing a simple assessment of functional movement. The Airman slowly does
             work-related or functional movements he or she wants to improve upon. An example would be the Airman
             whose job requires them to bend over, pick up an object and place it in an overhead position. This work-related
             task has the functional movement of a squat and an overhead press with a weight. By incorporating these moves
             into a strength training program the Airman can improve strength and therefore, improve work-related tasks
             while reducing injuries by being conditioned in those muscles needed to perform the work. If the Airman‘s
             performance of a task is not adequate or if he or she wishes to improve, strength training for the identified
             muscles will be beneficial. In this way, he or she ensures maximum carryover value to his or her warrior tasks.
      18.5.2. Principle of Regularity.
             Exercise must be done regularly to produce a training effect. Sporadic exercise may do more harm than good.
             Airmen can maintain a moderate level of strength by doing proper strength workouts only once a week for a
             short period of time if they have already established a strong baseline level of muscular fitness. However, but
             three workouts per week are best for optimal gains. The principle of regularity also applies to the exercises for
             individual muscle groups. An Airman can work out three times a week, but when different muscle groups are
             exercised at each workout, the principle of regularity is violated and gains in strength are minimal. Airmen
             should strive for exercising the same muscle group a minimum of two times each week.
      18.5.3. Principle of Recovery.
             Consecutive days of hard resistance training for the same muscle group can be detrimental. The muscles must
             be allowed sufficient recovery time to adapt. Strength training can be done every day only if the exercised
             muscle groups are rotated, so that the same muscle or muscle group is not exercised on consecutive days. There
             should be at least a 48-hour recovery period between workouts for the same muscle groups. For example, the
AFPAM36-2241        1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                          427

             legs can be trained with weights on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and the upper body muscles on Tuesday,
             Thursday, and Saturday. Recovery is also important within a workout. The recovery time between different
             exercises and sets depends, in part, on the intensity of the workout. Normally, the recovery time between sets
             should be 30 to 180 seconds.
      18.5.4. Principle of Balance.
             When developing a strength-training program, it is important to include exercises that work all the major
             muscle groups in both the upper and lower body. One should not work just the muscle groups in the upper body,
             thinking that running will strengthen the legs. Most muscles are organized into opposing pairs. Activating one
             muscle results in a pulling motion while activating the opposing muscle results in the opposite or pushing
             movement. When planning a training session, one training technique is to follow a pushing exercise with a
             pulling exercise that results in movement at the same joints. For example, follow an overhead press with a
             lateral pull-down exercise. This technique helps ensure good strength balance between opposing muscle groups
             which may, in turn, reduce the risk of injury. Sequence the program to exercise the larger muscle groups first,
             then the smaller muscles. For example, the pull-down stresses both the larger latissimus dorsi muscle of the
             back and the smaller biceps muscles of the arm. If curls are done first, the smaller muscle group will be
             exhausted and too weak to handle the resistance needed for the lat pull-down. As a result, the Airman cannot do
             as many repetitions with as much weight as he or she normally could in the pull-down. The latissimus dorsi
             muscles will not be overloaded and, as a result, they may not benefit very much from the workout.
      18.5.5. Principle of Variety.
             A major challenge for all fitness training programs is maintaining enthusiasm and interest. A poorly designed
             strength-training program can be very boring. Using different equipment, changing the exercises, and altering
             the volume and intensity are good ways to add variety, and they may also produce better results. The Airmen
             should periodically substitute different exercises for given muscle groups. For example, Airmen can do squats
             with a barbell instead of leg presses on a weight machine. Also, for variety or due to necessity (for example,
             when in the field), they can switch to partner-resisted exercises or another form of resistance training. However,
             frequent wholesale changes should be avoided as Airmen may become frustrated if they do not have enough
             time to adapt or to see improvements in strength.
18.6. Flexibility Training:
      18.6.1. Flexibility is an important component of any fitness program. Many activity-related injuries have their root in
      lack of flexibility. Think of your muscles as rubber bands. When they are cold, they are rigid and brittle. When warm,
      they stretch and retract more easily. Conducting a good warm-up before exercising and a good cool down upon
      completion will help prevent injury and reduce muscle soreness.
      18.6.2. No matter what your current fitness level, you should always begin your exercise sessions with a warm-up. A
      good warm-up sequence is as follows: jog in place or a specified location for 1 to 2 minutes. This causes a gradual
      increase in the heart rate, blood pressure, circulation, and increases the temperature of the active muscles. Next,
      perform slow joint rotation exercises (for example, arm circles, knee and ankle rotations) to gradually increase the
      joint‘s range of motion. Work each major joint for 5 to 10 seconds. Excessive stretching prior to the exercise session is
      not necessary and in some instances can compromise joint integrity. The joints and muscles provide a support system
      for the body, over stretching prior to the exercise session may loosen that support system. Stretching after the session
      is the preferred time period.
      18.6.3. Immediately following your exercise session, stretch as part of your cool down. After exercising, when your
      muscles are their warmest is the best time to improve your flexibility. Do not limit flexibility exercises to cool down
      only. Take the time to dedicate sessions to flexibility. Stretching throughout the day is also a great idea. Stretching is
      one form of exercise that takes very little time relative to the benefits gained. Assume all stretching positions slowly
      until you feel tension or slight discomfort. Hold each position for 10 to 15 seconds during the cool down, relax the
      stretch, and then repeat for maximum benefit.
18.7. Body Composition.
      The two largest factors that contribute to maintaining a positive body composition are exercise and diet.
      18.7.1. A combination of exercise and diet is the best way to lose excessive body fat. Losing 1 to 2 pounds a week is a
      realistic goal that is best accomplished by reducing caloric intake and increasing energy expenditure. In other words,
      one should eat less and exercise more. Dieting alone can cause the body to believe it is being starved. In response, it
      tries to conserve its fat reserves by slowing down its metabolic rate and, as a result, it loses at a slower rate.
428                                                                                  1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
      18.7.2. Airmen must consume a minimum number of calories from all the major food groups, with the calories
      distributed over all the daily meals including snacks. This ensures an adequate consumption of necessary vitamins and
      minerals. A male Airman who is not under medical supervision when dieting requires a caloric intake of at least 1,500;
      women require at least 1,200 calories. Airmen should avoid diets that fail to meet these criteria.
      18.7.3. Trying to lose weight with fad diets and devices or by skipping meals does not work for long-term fat loss.
      Weight lost through these practices is mostly water and lean muscle tissue, not fat. Losing fat safely takes time and
      patience. There is no quick and easy way to improve body composition.
      18.7.4. The Airman who diets and does not exercise loses not only fat, but muscle tissue as well. This can negatively
      affect his or her physical readiness. Not only does exercise burn calories, it helps the body maintain its useful muscle
      mass, and it may also help keep the body‘s metabolic rate high during dieting. Fat is best utilized during aerobic
      exercise. Aerobic exercise, which uses lots of oxygen, is the best type of activity for burning fat. Aerobic exercise
      includes jogging, walking, swimming, bicycling, cross-country skiing, rowing, stair climbing, and jumping rope.
      Anaerobic activities, such as sprinting or lifting heavy weights, burn little, if any, fat.
      18.7.5. Exercise alone is not the best way to lose body fat, especially in large amounts. For an average-sized person,
      running or walking 1 mile burns about 100 calories. Because there are 3,500 calories in 1 pound of fat, an Airman
      needs to run or walk 35 miles if pure fat were being burned. In reality, fat is seldom the only source of energy used
      during aerobic exercise. Instead, a mixture of both fats and carbohydrates is used. As a result, most people would need
      to run or walk over 50 miles to burn 1 pound of fat. A combination of proper diet and aerobic exercise is the proven
      way to lose excessive body fat. Local dietitians and nutritionists can help Airmen who want to lose weight by
      suggesting safe and sensible diet programs.
18.8. Warm-up and Cool Down:
      18.8.1. The Warm-up.
            Before beginning any vigorous physical activity, one should prepare the body for exercise. The dynamic warm-
            up increases the flow of blood to the muscles and tendons, thus helping reduce the risk of injury and increases
            the joint‘s range of motion and positively affects the speed of muscular contraction. Airmen should do the
            following recommended sequence of dynamic warm-up activities for 5 to 7 minutes before vigorous exercise:
            18.8.1.1. Slowly jog in place or walk for 1 to 2 minutes. This causes a gradual increase in the heart rate, blood
            pressure, and circulation, and increases the temperature of the active muscles.
            18.8.1.2. Slowly rotate joints (for example, arm circles, knee and ankle rotations) to gradually increase their
            range of motion. Work each major joint for 5 to 10 seconds.
            18.8.1.3. Slowly mimic the activities to be performed. For example, lift a lighter weight to warm up before
            lifting a heavier one. This helps prepare the neuromuscular pathways. The dynamic warm-up increases the flow
            of blood to the muscles and tendons, helping reduce the risk of injury, increasing the joint‘s range of motion,
            and positively affecting the speed of muscular contraction.
      18.8.2. Cool Down.
            The following information explains the importance of cooling down and how to do it correctly.
            18.8.2.1. Do not stop suddenly after vigorous exercise. Gradually bring the body back to its resting state by
            slowly decreasing the intensity of the activity. After running, for example, one should walk for 1 to 2 minutes.
            Stopping exercise suddenly can cause blood to pool in the muscles, thereby reducing blood flow to the heart and
            brain. This may cause fainting or abnormal heart rhythm which could lead to serious complications.
            18.8.2.2. Repeat the stretches done in the warm-up to help ease muscle tension and any immediate feeling of
            muscle soreness. Be careful not to overstretch. The muscles are warm from activity and can possibly be
            overstretched to the point of injury.
            18.8.2.3. Hold stretches 15 - 30 seconds or more during the cool down to improve flexibility.
            18.8.2.4. Do not limit flexibility training to the cool down periods. Stretching is one form of exercise that takes
            very little time relative to the benefits gained, and may be done easily at home or work. Repetitive movements
            at work or having a more sedentary job can increase tension in specific muscle groups which would benefit
            from mild stretching during the course of the day.

18.9. Unit Physical Fitness Training Program:
      18.9.1. Commander-driven physical fitness training is the backbone of the Air Force physical fitness program. The
      program promotes aerobic and muscular fitness, flexibility, and optimal body composition of each member in the unit.
      Safety must be an overarching concern throughout physical training (PT) and testing.
      18.9.2. The program will meet the current ability level of the members while encouraging and challenging members to
      progress to a higher fitness level. The 1.5-mile timed run, 1-mile walk, abdominal circumference (AC), push-up, and
      sit-up tests are designed to measure the effectiveness of the PT program. However, training should not be limited to
      these test activities.
      18.9.3. The unit fitness program should incorporate the guidelines established in AFI 36-2905, Fitness Program, to
      develop general fitness, prevent boredom, and decrease repetitive strain injuries. Finally, the program should ensure a
      safe environment for training by assessing traffic patterns, use of headphones or other personal equipment,
      temperature, availability of water and first aid, and awareness of emergency procedures. Individual safety issues, such
      as medical limitations and level of ability, should also be considered.
18.10. Physical Fitness Standard:
      18.10.1. The Air Force uses a composite fitness score based on aerobic fitness, muscular strength/endurance, and body
      composition using AC measurements to determine overall fitness. Overall fitness is directly related to health risk,
      including risk of disease (morbidity) and death (mortality). A composite score of 75 or greater, in addition to meeting
      the minimum component scores, represents the minimum accepted for health, fitness, and readiness levels. Health and
      readiness benefits continue to increase as body composition improves and physical activity and fitness levels increase.
      Members are encouraged to optimize their readiness status and posture by improving their overall fitness. Age- and
      gender-specific fitness score charts are provided in AFI 36-2905. Note: Meeting just the minimum component scores
      does not constitute the minimum points required to earn a composite passing score. Scoring the minimum component
      values in all components will not generate enough points to earn a composite score of 75 or greater. The minimum
      components are established to ensure members test adequately in all components and avoid ―asymmetrical fitness‖
      which is excelling in some and disregarding others.
      18.10.2. Members will receive a composite score on a 0 to 100 scale based on the following maximum component
      scores: 60 points for aerobic fitness assessment (FA), 20 points for body composition, 10 points for push-ups, and 10
      points for sit-ups. The following formula is used to determine the score: composite score = total component points
      achieved multiplied by 100 and divided by total possible points.
      18.10.3. Members with a medical profile prohibiting them from performing one or more components of the FA will
      have a composite score calculated on the tested components.
            18.10.3.1. Exemptions. Biannually, members must complete a composite FA. Exemptions are designed to
            categorize members as unable or unavailable to train or test, for reasons beyond the control of the member or
            commander, for a limited time period as outlined in AFI 36-2905.
            18.10.3.2. Component Exemptions. The commander, in consultation with the exercise physiologist
            (EP)/fitness program managers (FPM), may grant members exemption from aerobic and muscle fitness
            components based on medical recommendation according to AFI 36-2905 for a time-limited period. Other FA
            components will still be assessed.
      18.10.4. Composite scores represent a health-based fitness level. As the fitness level increases, Airmen are able to
      tolerate extremes in temperature, fatigue, and stress while optimizing performance in the deployed environment. Refer
      to Table 18.1 for fitness levels.
      18.10.5. Members must have a current fitness score on file prior to deployment. Member will not be considered
      ―exempt‖ in the deployed location until their current FA expires. If a member fails before deploying and their
      OPR/EPR closes out after the deployment starts, member will be marked ―DOES NOT MEET STANDARDS‖ on the
      OPR/EPR. If they pass, they will be marked ―MEETS STANDARDS‖ on the OPR/EPR. The only time ―exempt‖
      should be marked is if their current FA ―expires‖ and they are in a deployed location where they CANNOT test or
      choose not to volunteer to test at locations where FA testing is available.
      18.10.6. Any failures will be annotated in AFFMS and will be considered against the individual. However, if an
      Airman reaches the 91-day mark after the Unsatisfactory FA, but before the evaluation closes out, the Unsatisfactory
      score is no longer current and the evaluation will be marked "exempt." If an Airman has a current/passing score before
      deploying and his/her evaluation closes out after the deployment starts, the Airman will be marked ―MEETS
430                                                                                  1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
      STANDARDS.‖ For Satisfactory and Excellent scores, deployed Airmen become ―exempt‖ only when they reach the
      first day of the month, seven/thirteen calendar months following the previous official FA rating.

18.11. Physical Fitness Assessment (FA):
      18.11.1. Installations will develop a local plan, signed by the installation commander, for unit commanders to appoint
      physical training leaders (PTL) to augment the Fitness Assessment Cell (FAC) for the purpose of administering FAs.
      FAC augmentees will conduct FAs and designated FAC personnel will provide oversight. FAC augmentees will not
      test members from their own unit. The FAC will conduct the FA for all Airmen (Regular Air Force, Reserve, and
      Guard). Note: Where no FAC exists, FAs should be conducted by a certified PTL from another unit. Arrangements of
      this sort will be determined by local leadership.
      18.11.2. The fitness screening questionnaire (FSQ) should be completed no earlier than 30 calendar days (90 days for
      Air Reserve Component [ARC]), but no later than 7 days prior to the assessment, to provide time for medical
      evaluation, when indicated. Note: Failure to complete the FSQ does not invalidate the FA.
      18.11.3. Medical providers may recommend temporary medical exemptions for medical conditions that prevent a
      member from safely participating in specific physical conditioning programs or in a component of the FA. An exercise
      physiologist issues a temporary exemption from testing if necessary based on the recommendation of the medical
      provider. Assessment for participation in fitness activities should be made at each visit to prevent the member from
      having to return for clearance or exemption at a later date.
      18.11.4. Pregnant service members will engage in physical activity to maintain cardiovascular and muscular fitness
      throughout the pregnancy and postpartum period according to medical provider recommendations. Exercise regimens
      will consist of routines that include PT and nutrition counseling. Members are exempted from fitness testing during
      pregnancy and for 180 days after the delivery date.
18.12. Assessment Procedures.
      All components of the FA must be completed within a 3-hour window on the same day. If extenuating circumstances
      occur (for example, rapidly changing or severe weather conditions, natural disasters, emergencies, safety issues, etc.),
      then all components must be completed within 5 duty days. Reserve members must be in a duty status for assessments.
      The body composition component for the fitness assessment is fulfilled by measuring height, weight, and AC which
      must be the first component assessed in the FA. The muscular fitness components (push-ups and sit-ups) may be
      accomplished before or after the 1.5-mile run but must be completed after the 1-mile walk. There is a minimum 3-
      minute rest period between components. The assessment components should be scheduled to allow adequate rest for
      members on irregular or shift work hours.
      18.12.1. Body Composition Assessment:
             18.12.1.1. Height and Weight. Height and weight are obtained by FAC members.
             18.12.1.2. AC. The AC measurement is used to obtain the body composition component score. FAC members
             or trained augmentees will take the AC measurement in a private room or a partitioned area. See AFI 36-2905
             for the abdominal measurement procedures.
      18.12.2. Aerobic Assessment.
             The run and walk will be performed on an approved distance course. Aerobic fitness is measured with a 1.5-
             mile run, according to procedures outlined in AFI 36-2905. All members will complete the 1.5-mile timed run
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                         431

            unless medically exempted. Members medically exempted from the run and cleared for an alternate assessment
            will, upon recommendation by the EP/FPM, complete the 1-mile walk, according to procedures in AFI 36-2905.
            Members who perform the 1-mile walk will not be allowed to run (that is, at least one foot must be in contact
            with the ground at all times) or the assessment will be terminated. The 1-mile walk is the only authorized
            alternate assessment for Regular Air Force and ARC members. Note: The member does not select the
            assessment method. The EP/FPM determines which assessment to use based on the member‘s assessment
            history and medical recommendation.
      18.12.3. Muscular Fitness Assessment.
            Upper body muscular strength and endurance are measured with a 1-minute timed push-up test; abdominal
            muscular strength and endurance is measured with a 1-minute timed sit-up test.
18.13. Ongoing Education and a Supportive Environment.
      Physical fitness education will be incorporated into training programs and unit PT. Ongoing commander emphasis and
      a supportive environment are essential to maintain force health and fitness.
      18.13.1. Intervention and Support.
            The Health and Wellness Center (HAWC) manages the Balanced Eating, Work out Effectively, Living Longer
            (BE WELL) Program, which targets nutritional and exercise behavior changes necessary to improve one‘s
            health and fitness. Participation is mandatory for all Air Force members with an unsatisfactory score, and is
            available to all members who want to improve their fitness.
      18.13.2. Environment.
            The installation environment will be conducive for all members to maintain a healthy lifestyle, and a
            community-based education and awareness program that addresses optimal nutrition, body composition, and
            fitness evident to all members. In addition, education and intervention programs will be available to ARC
            personnel.
18.14. Unit Key Players.
      The unit PT program success depends on many people, including the unit commander, unit fitness program manager
      (UFPM), PTL, immediate supervisor, and the individual.
      18.14.1. Unit Commander.
            The unit commander promotes, supports, and ensures unit fitness program integrity and provides an
            environment that is conducive to healthy lifestyle choices; provides an overall work environment for a
            community that is supportive of optimal nutrition and fitness by providing access to facilities that provide
            healthy foods and encourages Airmen to participate in physical fitness during the duty day; and implements and
            maintains a unit PT program according to guidelines in AFI 36-2905.
      18.14.2. Unit Fitness Program Manager (UFPM).
            The UFPM oversees the administration of the fitness program for the unit, notifies the unit commander if
            members fail to attend scheduled fitness appointments, and provides fitness metrics and unit status reports to the
            unit commander monthly.
      18.14.3. Physical Training Leaders (PTL):
            18.14.3.1. The PTL completes the initial PTL course provided by the EP/FPM before overseeing and
            conducting the unit fitness program and maintains currency by receiving annual refresher course or upon
            change of duty station, whichever comes first. ARC PTLs at co-located bases will receive initial and refresher
            training from Regular Air Force EP/FPMs. Where it is not feasible for ARC PTLs to receive in person training,
            they will complete distance learning training as coordinated through the Air Force Medical Operations Agency
            and the supporting base EP/FPM.
            18.13.3.2. PTLs must complete basic life support and automated external defibrillator training before attending
            the PTL certification course. They must maintain currency while serving as PTLs.
432                                                                                    1 OCTOBER 2013           AFPAM36-2241
      18.14.4. Individual.
             Individuals must maintain individual year-round physical fitness through self-directed and unit-based fitness
             programs and proper nutrition standards according to AFI 36-2905. Individuals must also meet Air Force fitness
             minimum standards and attend all required fitness program appointments.

Section 18C—Nutrition
18.15. Nutrition.
      Airmen are responsible to be mission ready at all times and must recognize that food is the fuel that supports our
      performance and endurance. To understand how nutrients affect the body, Airmen must understand the following basic
      concepts:
      18.15.1. Macronutrients.
             These are essential calorie-containing nutrients (your body needs them to operate properly) that are needed in
             relatively large amounts. The three main types of macronutrients are carbohydrates, fats, and protein.
             18.15.1.1. Carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are known as the ―energy powerhouse,‖ because they are what our
             bodies (especially our brains and muscles) need for fuel. The foods that provide carbohydrates are dairy
             (low/nonfat milk and yogurt), fruits, grains, starchy vegetables, and sweets. Carbohydrate-rich foods such as
             grain and cereal products, fruits, starchy vegetables, and legumes are excellent sources of fiber. Vitamins and
             minerals are abundant in many of these foods. We can store carbohydrates in the body (as glycogen in muscles
             and liver); we also need to maintain a certain amount in our bloodstream to give us energy. There are two types
             of carbohydrates: simple (refined sugars, fruit juice), and complex (whole grains, fruits and starchy vegetables).
             Complex carbohydrates take longer to convert to glucose, keeping blood sugar levels consistent and preventing
             an energy crash in the middle of a workout. Most sports nutritionists recommend that carbohydrates make up
             one-half to two-thirds of the calories in a diet. Too little carbohydrates (less than 40 percent), can cause a person
             to feel faint, dizzy, and weak, and cause trouble concentrating or experience low blood sugar (hypoglycemia).
             18.15.1.2. Protein. Amino acids are the building blocks of protein, which are necessary to build and repair
             muscle tissue, grow hair and fingernails, produce hormones, boost your immune system and replace red blood
             cells. Animal products are not the only source of protein; plenty of vegetable-based options exist, including
             beans, nuts, lentils, and tofu. Low fat and nonfat dairy products are another good source of protein. Grains and
             vegetables also contain small amounts of protein. It is true that protein is needed for the development of muscle,
             but it is not true that ―more‖ protein will build bigger muscles. Excess protein is burned for energy or, as a last
             resort, stored as glycogen or fat. Human bodies do not store protein, so adequate portions need to be consumed
             daily. Excess protein can lead to a host of problems, including dehydration (from frequent urination), an
             unbalanced diet and possibly increased calorie and fat intake. General guidelines for healthy individuals are
             between 0.5 and 0.8 grams of protein per pound of body weight depending on activity level. Because protein
             requirements differ by age, activity level, and gender, Airmen should consult with the installation‘s registered
             dietitian or diet technician.
             18.15.1.3. Fats. Excessive fat can lead to weight gain, heart disease, and cancer, however, some fat is actually
             necessary and beneficial. Fat provides a ready source of energy, builds cell walls, transports and stores fat
             soluble vitamins, insulates, protects vital organs, and makes food taste better. However, there is a need to pay
             attention to the types of fats consumed. Less healthy fats such as trans fats and saturated fats, are usually found
             in commercially baked foods and animal products. Healthier fats are mono- and poly-unsaturated fats, found
             mostly in plant foods such as olive oil, canola oil, peanut oil, avocados, and most nuts. Fatty fish such as tuna
             and salmon are a good source of these healthy fats, too. Body fat storage varies from person to person, based on
             many factors including gender (women typically store more fat than men for biological reasons). Even in a
             fairly lean individual, there will be a good energy source from stored fat. For example, a 150-pound person who
             has 10 percent body fat has about 62,000 calories stored as fat (this is why you can live much longer without
             food than without water). Since the body's fat storage is more than adequate to provide reserve energy, only a
             small amount of dietary fat is needed. In fact, a moderately low in fat diet (no more than 30 percent of total
             calories from fat) will not hinder performance and will promote an eating style that will be beneficial
             throughout life for physical performance and overall health. Fat is digested slowly and may cause digestive
             distress, and therefore not recommended as part of a pre-exercise snack.
             18.15.1.4. Fluids. Water is essential for life; the human body is made up of over 50 percent water. (The exact
             percentage is different for males and females and also from one person to another.) Water has no calories and is
             needed to transport nutrients throughout your body, while also hosting many of your body‘s other functions,
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                          433

            including waste elimination. Exercise places great demands on fluid replacement so that proper hydration
            before, during, and after intense workouts is critical. Individuals who fail to keep up with their water
            requirements not only jeopardize their performance, but also put themselves at risk for heat cramps, heat
            exhaustion and stroke. There is a simple calculation to determine water intake: divide your body weight in half,
            that‘s how many ounces, minimum, you should be drinking every day. For example, a 150-pound person should
            be drinking at least 75 ounces (about 10 cups) of fluid per day. The simplest way to tell if you are adequately
            hydrated is the urine test. Drink enough water so that your urine is consistently pale yellow or clear, and weakly
            scented. In general for activities less than 60 minutes, water is the best beverage for hydration. If you are doing
            more than 60 minutes of continuous exercise, then you may benefit from a sports drink to replace electrolytes
            and carbohydrates. Other fluid sources include fresh fruit, broth-based soups, juices, milk, and fresh vegetables.
      18.15.2. MyPlate.
            The United States Department of Agriculture‘s MyPlate food guidance system (Figure 18.2) provides many
            options to help you make healthy food choices and to be active every day. It is important to remember that this
            is based on a standard 9-inch plate. Go to www.choosemyplate.gov for more tools and recommendations.
            Dietary guidelines for Americans provide science-based advice on food and physical activity choices for better
            health. More recommendations can be found on www.choosemyplate.gov or by consulting with your
            installation‘s registered dietitian or diet technician.

MyPlate Food Guidance System.
                                                                 Maintaining a healthy weight is one of the keys to a long,
                                                                 successful career. The Air Force recognizes AC as one of the
                                                                 most specific indicators of disease risk in adults. Excessive
                                                                 body weight is an issue, harming physical performance and
                                                                 increasing the risk of consequences due to military
                                                                 appearance standards. Being overweight or obese increases
                                                                 risk of high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, heart
                                                                 disease, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, breathing problems, and
                                                                 certain types of cancer. Weight loss should be a gradual
                                                                 process, 1 to 2 pounds per week is considered to be a healthy
                                                                 and safe weight loss goal. Start by making small and gradual
                                                                 changes in eating behaviors and physical activity. To do this,
                                                                 build a healthy base and make sensible choices while
                                                                 avoiding fad diets and supplements which are short-term
                                                                 solutions and are sometimes dangerous. Maintaining a
                                                                 healthy energy balance is important. Calories in need to be
                                                                 less than calories out to lose weight. Active individuals
                                                                 should never go below 1,200 calories per day (women) or
                                                                 1,500 calories per day (men). Long-term weight management
      is not about being in control, it‘s about being in charge! To understand why this distinction is important, consider the
      differences between people who don‘t struggle with their weight, people who are overweight, and people who are
      always on a diet. Small changes do add up, start by making incremental changes and commit to them for the long-
      term, such as eating 100 fewer calories each day (less than a can of soda).

      18.15.4. Nutritional fitness.
            18.15.4.1. DoD is now viewing war-fighters as athletes and this requires a different nutritional approach.
            Performance nutrition doesn‘t just apply to sports nutrition; it is in the context of fueling for optimum
            performance across all levels of activity. What nutrition is put into your body impacts what physical abilities
            can come out of your body, this is the essence of nutritional fitness.
            18.15.4.2. Nutritional fitness is defined as having safe and the appropriate quantity, quality, choice, and timing
            of fuels, nutrients and fluids to sustain and optimize physical and cognitive performance, wellness and health,
            support environmental adaptations, accelerate healing, and protect against disease. An eating environment that
            makes healthy choices the easy choice, along with performance-based nutrition education, will help promote
            nutritional fitness and a resilient and fit force. When necessary, dietary supplements may be recommended to
            supplement the diet.

      18.15.5. Performance Nutrition Basics.
            The purpose of a pre-exercise meal or snack is to provide enough fluid to maintain hydration and enough
            carbohydrates to maintain proper blood sugar levels during activity. A pre-exercise meal (includes some carbs,
            protein and fat) should be consumed 3 to 4 hours before starting the activity. This allows time for the body to
            digest the food. A small amount of protein before exercise may reduce muscle soreness later. Pre-exercise
            snacks: 30 to 60 minutes before an activity, it is a good idea to have a snack. Food and drinks should contain
            mainly carbohydrates since they are digested quickly and turned to energy-giving glucose. Examples are
            bananas or other fruits (grapes, applesauce, and peaches), graham crackers, pretzels, or dry cereal. Avoid foods
            with fat and fiber in a pre-exercise snack, this will minimize possibility of an upset stomach. Recovery snacks:
            What is eaten after exercising depends on the time and intensity of the workout. If exercising lightly for less
            than a half hour no snacks or meals need to be eaten. However, if the exercise routine is rigorous and lasts for
            more than 45 minutes, a snack or light meal will help in recovery. This ―recovery‖ meal helps replenish the
            carbohydrates burned during exercise and puts them into storage form for later use. Adding protein to the meal
            or snack helps rebuild muscle tears that happen during exercise. Timing and what is eaten are also important
            factors to consider. A rule of thumb is to eat within 15 to 60 minutes of finishing your exercise. Examples of
            simple post-workout snacks include low fat chocolate milk, low fat yogurt, trail mix (cereal, nuts and dried
            fruit) and water, or string cheese and a fruit bar with water. Hydration should be a top priority. Recovery fluids
            include: juices, which supply water, carbohydrates, vitamins and potassium; watery foods such as watermelon,
            grapes and soups; high carbohydrate sports drinks; commercial fluid replacers and water. Determine how much
            water is lost by taking a weight measurement before and after a hard training workout. A good goal should be to
            lose no more than 2 percent of total body weight (for example, 3 pounds for a 150-pound person). Additionally,
            avoid drastic changes in diet before a fitness test; try out new foods during training times.
      18.15.6. Use of Supplements.
            The use of dietary supplements has become increasingly popular among members of the military. Supplements
            are intended to supplement a diet, not substitute for it. They may contain vitamins, minerals, herbs, botanicals,
            amino acids, or other substances and are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. This lack of
            oversight means there is no guarantee that what you purchase is what you get. Supplements can often do more
            harm than good, and individuals should consult a qualified healthcare professional before taking any
            supplements. Climate and stress may cause different reactions to the dietary supplements, especially in a
            deployed environment. When considering taking a supplement, it is best to proceed with caution. The DoD has
            created a site called the Human Performance Resource Center that has updates on supplements and other
            performance nutrition information. Reliable, science-based information can be found at
            www.humanperformanceresourcecenter.com. Visit the Human Performance Resource Center and review/use
            the materials provided to include free access to the Natural Medicine comprehensive database. After reviewing
            the information, Airmen must still consult their primary care physician or flight surgeon to get clearance on
            what to take and what not to take.

Section 18D—Substance Abuse
18.16. Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT) and Demand Reduction (DR) Programs:
      18.16.1. ADAPT and DR programs include substance abuse (SA) prevention, education, treatment, and urinalysis
      testing. SA prevention and treatment policies and programs are thoroughly integrated into every facet of Air Force
      core values, quality of life, and force management. These policies have been in place for over two decades and have
      evolved to meet changing conditions within the Air Force. Our members are held to the highest standards of discipline
      and behavior, both on and off duty. Individuals who experience problems related to SA will receive counseling and
      treatment as needed; however, all Air Force members are held accountable for unacceptable behavior.
      18.16.2. The ADAPT Program objectives are to promote readiness, health, and wellness through the prevention and
      treatment of SA; minimize the negative consequences of SA to the individual, family, and organization; provide
      comprehensive education and treatment to individuals who experience problems attributed to SA; and return identified
      substance abusers to unrestricted duty status or assist them in their transition to civilian life.
18.17. Policy on Drug Abuse:
      18.17.1. DoD policy is to prevent and eliminate drug and alcohol abuse and dependence from the DoD. Such abuse
      and dependence are incompatible with readiness, the maintenance of high standards of performance, and military
      discipline. Drug abuse is defined as the illegal, wrongful, or improper use, possession, sale, transfer, or introduction
      onto a military installation of any drug defined in AFI 44-121, Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment
      (ADAPT) Program. ―Wrongful‖ means without legal justification or excuse.
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                          435

      18.17.2. Studies have shown that products made with hemp seed and hemp seed oil may contain varying levels of
      tetrahydrocannabinol, an active ingredient of marijuana which is detectable under the Air Force Drug Testing
      Program. To ensure military readiness, the ingestion of products containing or products derived from hemp seed or
      hemp seed oil is prohibited. Failure by military personnel to comply with the prohibition on the ingestion of products
      containing or products derived from hemp seed or hemp seed oil is a violation of Article 92, Uniform Code of Military
      Justice (UCMJ).
      18.17.3. To ensure military readiness, safeguard the health and wellness of the force, and to maintain good order and
      discipline in the Service, the knowing use of any intoxicating substance, other than the lawful use of alcohol or
      tobacco products, that is inhaled, injected, consumed, or introduced into the body in any manner to alter mood or
      function, is prohibited. These substances include, but are not limited to, controlled substance analogues (for example,
      designer drugs such as ―spice‖ that are not otherwise controlled substances); inhalants, propellants, solvents,
      household chemicals, and other substances used for ―huffing;‖ prescription or over-the-counter medications when used
      in a manner contrary to their intended medical purpose or in excess of the prescribed dosage; and naturally occurring
      intoxicating substances (for example, Salvia divinorum). The possession of any intoxicating substance described in
      this paragraph, if done with the intent to use in a manner that would alter mood or function, is also prohibited. Failure
      by military personnel to comply with the prohibitions contained in this paragraph is a violation of Article 92, UCMJ.
      18.17.4. All patients diagnosed with SA or dependence and entered into the ADAPT Program will be recommended
      for limited duty, indicating the patient is not worldwide qualified.
18.18. Policy on Alcohol Abuse.
      Air Force policy recognizes that alcohol abuse negatively affects public behavior, duty performance, and/or physical
      and mental health. The Air Force provides comprehensive clinical assistance to eligible beneficiaries seeking help for
      an alcohol problem.
      18.18.1. ADAPT Program.
            AFI 44-121 provides guidance for the identification, treatment, and management of personnel with SA
            problems and describes Air Force policy regarding alcohol and drug abuse.
      18.18.2. Drunk Driving.
            AFMAN 31-116, Air Force Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision, applies to everyone with military installation
            driving privileges. AFMAN 31-116 establishes guidance on court hearing procedures, convictions, non-judicial
            punishment, civilian administrative action, or appropriate punishment for violation of impaired and intoxicated
            driving policies. If a member has a blood alcohol percentage of 0.05 but less than 0.10, the person is presumed
            to be impaired. Intoxicated driving is operating a motor vehicle under intoxication caused by alcohol or drugs.
            There is a 1-year driving privilege suspension for driving or being in physical control of a motor vehicle while
            under the influence of intoxicating liquor 0.10 percent or greater. Note: In the United States, if a state uses a
            more stringent standard (for example, 0.08 instead of 0.10), Air Force units will use the lower standard.
            Overseas, the limit is 0.10 unless the Secretary of Defense sets a lower limit.
18.19. Identification and Referral:
      18.19.1. Recognizing and Referring Personnel for Substance Use and Abuse:
            18.19.1.1. Each person is responsible for exercising good judgment in the use of alcohol when not otherwise
            restricted by public law or military directive. The Air Force reviews members‘ drinking habits that affect public
            behavior, duty performance, or physical and mental health. The Air Force provides non-punitive assistance to
            members seeking help for an alcohol problem. In assessing potential drug- and alcohol-related problems, the
            supervisory role is to identify subordinates with problems early and to motivate them to seek and accept help.
            18.19.1.2. As depicted in Figure 18.3, many signs and symptoms of SA exist. However, the presence of these
            signs, though common indicators of SA, does not always substantiate an SA problem. To note all the behavioral
            symptoms that may suggest SA or precisely define their sequence and severity is impossible. They are exactly
            as stated—signs and symptoms. Do not use these signs to make a conclusive diagnosis of SA. This
            responsibility lies with the ADAPT Program personnel. If any of these signs are present, it may suggest a
            potential problem exists for the member. Talk with the member and explain why you are concerned. Fear of
            discussing concerns is normal, but it is important to address the concern early before the problem gets out of
            control. Document and discuss specific instances of unusual behavior with the supervisor, first sergeant, or unit
            commander. This will help expedite the care a subordinate may need. When additional professional assistance is
            needed, do not hesitate to document and then refer troubled subordinates to the ADAPT Program. Note: Help
436                                                                                      1 OCTOBER 2013        AFPAM36-2241
             must be offered to every individual. Any time a person acknowledges an SA problem, notify the supervisor,
             first sergeant, or unit commander.

      18.19.2. Identifying Substance Abusers.
             For the Air Force to have an effective SA prevention and treatment program, there must be a means of
             identifying service members experiencing problems with substance use. Although commanders play a major
             role in identifying substance abusers, members should be aware of how commanders must proceed in various
             circumstances. Due to the nature of the position noncommissioned officers hold within the unit, they also play
             an important part in the identification process. There are basically five identification methods:
             18.19.2.1. Medical Care Referrals. Medical personnel must notify the unit commander and the ADAPT
             program manager (ADAPTPM) when a member:
             18.19.2.1.1. Is observed, identified, or suspected to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol while seeking
             medical care.
             18.19.2.1.2. Receives treatment for an injury or illness that may be the result of SA.
             18.19.2.1.3. Is suspected of abusing substances.
             18.19.2.1.4. Is admitted as a patient for alcohol or drug detoxification.
             18.19.2.2. Commander’s Identification. Unit commanders will refer all service members for assessment when
             substance use is suspected to be a contributing factor in any incident; for example, driving under the influence,
             public intoxication, drunk and disorderly, spouse or child abuse and maltreatment, underage drinking, positive
             drug test, or when notified by medical personnel. When commanders or supervisors fail to refer a member with
             suspected or identified SA problems, it places the member at increased risk for developing more severe SA
             problems and may jeopardize the safety of others and ultimately mission accomplishment.
             18.19.2.3. Drug Testing. The Air Force conducts drug testing of personnel according to AFI 44-120, Military
             Drug Demand Reduction Program. Drug testing is most effective as a deterrent if it reaches each Air Force
             member; therefore, all military personnel are subject to testing regardless of grade, status, or position.
             Inspection testing is the best deterrent presently available against drug abuse. Military members may receive an
             order or voluntarily consent to provide urine samples at any time. Military members who fail to comply with an
             order to provide a urine sample are subject to punitive action under the UCMJ. Commander-directed testing
             should only be used as a last resort because the results cannot be used in actions under the UCMJ, or to
             characterize a member‘s service either as general or under other-than-honorable conditions if the member is
             separated.
             18.19.2.3.1. Inspection Under Military Rule of Evidence 313. Inspection testing is the most common method
             of testing in the Air Force. Drug testing is random and unpredictable. In general, an inspection is an
             examination conducted as an incident of command, the primary purpose of which is to determine and ensure the
             security, military fitness, or good order and discipline of the unit, organization, or installation. Individuals are
             selected at random using a nonbiased selection process. Commanders may also select work sections, units, or
             segments of the military population to provide urine samples. Commanders may use the positive result of a
             urine sample to refer a member for an SA evaluation, as evidence to support disciplinary action under the
             UCMJ or administrative discharge action, and as a consideration on the issue of characterization of discharge in
             administrative discharges.
             18.19.2.3.2. Probable Cause. Probable cause requires a search and seizure authorization from the appropriate
             commander to seize a urine specimen. Probable cause exists when there is a reasonable belief that drugs will be
             found in the system of the member to be tested. Consult with the staff judge advocate regarding procedures for
             determining whether probable cause exists. Results may be used for UCMJ or to characterize administrative
             discharges.
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                          437

            18.19.2.4. Medical Purposes. Results of any examination conducted for a valid medical purpose including
            emergency medical treatment, periodic physical examination, and other such examinations necessary for
            diagnostic or treatment purposes may be used to identify drug abusers. Results may be used as evidence to
            support disciplinary action under the UCMJ, or administrative discharge action according to AFI 44-120, Table
            1. These results may also be considered on the issue of characterization of discharge in separation proceedings.
            18.19.2.5. Self-identification. Air Force members with SA problems are encouraged to seek assistance from the
            unit commander, first sergeant, SA counselor, or a military medical professional. Self-identification is reserved
            for members who are not currently under investigation or pending action as a result of an alcohol-related
            incident. Following the assessment, the ADAPTPM will consult with the treatment team and determine an
            appropriate clinical course of action.
            18.19.2.5.1. Drugs. An Air Force member may voluntarily disclose evidence of personal drug use or possession
            to the unit commander, first sergeant, SA counselor, or a military medical professional. Commanders will grant
            limited protection for Air Force members who reveal this information with the intention of entering treatment.
            Commanders may not use voluntary disclosure against a member in an action under the UCMJ or when
            weighing characterization of service in a separation. Disclosure is not voluntary if the Air Force member has
            previously been:
            18.19.2.5.1.1. Apprehended for drug involvement.
            18.19.2.5.1.2. Placed under investigation for drug abuse. The day and time when a member is considered placed
            under investigation is determined by the circumstances of each individual case. A member is under
            investigation, for example, when an entry is made in the security forces blotter, when the security forces
            investigator‘s log shows an initial case entry, or when the Air Force Office of Special Investigations opens a
            case file. A member is also considered under investigation when he or she has been questioned about drug use
            by investigative authorities or the member‘s commander, or when an allegation of drug use has been made
            against the member.
            18.19.2.5.1.3. Ordered to give a urine sample as part of the drug-testing program in which the results are still
            pending or have been returned as positive.
            18.19.2.5.1.4. Advised of a recommendation for administrative separation for drug abuse.
            18.19.2.5.1.5. Entered into treatment for drug abuse.
            18.19.2.5.2. Alcohol. Commanders must provide sufficient incentive to encourage members to seek help for
            problems with alcohol without fear of negative consequences. Self-identified members will enter the ADAPT
            assessment process and will be held to the same standards as others entering SA education, counseling, and
            treatment programs.
18.20. Leadership Responsibilities.
      The supervisor‘s role in the treatment process does not end with identifying and referring members. Though the
      supervisor is not charged with providing treatment, daily interaction with his or her personnel and the treatment team
      (TT) can have a significant impact on the success of the treatment efforts. Identifying individuals who need treatment
      is a critical first step in helping them break free of the tremendously potent cycle of denial, negativity, and increased
      SA. However, entering treatment is only a first step. A member‘s SA problem did not develop overnight. It took time,
      as will treatment and recovery. The supervisor must remain focused on the member‘s duty performance, attendance in
      the program, and maintenance of standards. One of the most critical components to a member‘s treatment is the
      treatment team meeting (TTM). Commander and/or first sergeant and supervisor involvement in the TTM at key
      points in the patient‘s treatment and recovery are important. The commander or first sergeant and the supervisor must
      be involved at program entry, termination, and anytime there are significant treatment difficulties with the patient. The
      primary objective of the TT is to guide the clinical course of the patient‘s treatment after examining all the facts. The
      TT consists of the commander, supervisor, member‘s counselor, medical consultants, other appropriate helping
      agencies, and the member.
18.21. Substance Abuse Assessment.
      The central purpose of the SA assessment is to determine the patient‘s need for treatment and level of care required.
      ADAPT staff members conduct the SA assessment within seven calendar days of notification. ADAPTPMs conduct
      required reviews of the patient‘s medical records and all documentation provided by the SA staff on a priority basis.
      Information gathered during the assessment will form the basis for patient diagnosis, treatment planning, and delivery
      of SA services.

18.22. Substance Abuse Treatment.
      SA treatment is divided into two services: nonclinical and clinical.
      18.22.1. Nonclinical Services.
            All active duty members involved in alcohol-related misconduct will be referred for an SA assessment.
            Members who do not meet diagnostic criteria for alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence will receive alcohol
            counseling targeted (secondary) prevention and education. All decisions about length and number of visits of
            targeted prevention and education will be based on thorough assessment and determination of risk and is
            tailored for the individual. There will be at least one follow-up appointment of a minimum of 30 minutes
            duration to reassess risk, assess progress, and as appropriate, conduct a follow-up review of the educational
            components. If the client is assessed to be at moderate or greater risk, there should be at least two 30-minute
            follow-ups with progress updates. The focus of these appointments is not treatment. They are designed to be
            targeted (individual) prevention, education, and reassessment. In addition to the initial assessment, a required
            alcohol education module will be completed within 2 weeks following the assessment. The alcohol education
            module includes information on Air Force policy, understanding the relationship between consumption,
            metabolism and intoxication, and physiological effects of alcohol on brain and body.
            18.22.1.1. Additional counseling addressing bio-psychosocial issues identified in the assessment may be
            prescribed. Length of involvement will be determined based on the patient‘s presenting problems and agreed-
            upon treatment or behavioral contract.
            18.22.1.2. Individuals being processed for separation are provided appropriate medical care (detoxification)
            before separation. Separation action is not postponed because of a member‘s participation in the ADAPT
            Program.
      18.22.2. Clinical Services:
            18.22.2.1. Patients meeting the Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM) IV diagnostic criteria for alcohol abuse or
            alcohol dependence will be entered into SA treatment with the level and intensity of care determined by the
            ADAPTPM using current American Society of Addiction Medicine criteria. The philosophy is to place
            personnel with SA problems in the least intensive or restrictive treatment environment possible appropriate to
            their therapeutic needs.
            18.22.2.2. Depending on the member‘s needs, variable lengths of stay or duration of treatment are provided
            within an array of treatment settings. The treatment program will reflect a multidisciplinary approach to assist
            the patient to achieve full recovery, free of the negative effect of the SA. Treatment plans are individually
            tailored to meet patient‘s needs. Family involvement is strongly encouraged.
            18.22.2.3. Individuals diagnosed with alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence will refrain from the use of alcohol
            during the initial phase of treatment and are strongly encouraged to continue to abstain during aftercare. Total
            abstinence is a critical treatment goal; however, because of the nature of alcoholism, relapses into drinking
            behavior are not uncommon and should be anticipated. A relapse by itself is not sufficient reason for program
            failure; however, relapses must be considered a significant threat to the patient‘s treatment and dealt with
            appropriately.
            18.22.2.4. Involvement in self-help recovery groups (such as 12-step, rational recovery) is encouraged as an
            adjunct to treatment. The frequency of attendance is determined by the TT with the patient.
18.23. Detoxification Prior to Treatment.
      Patients being referred for inpatient treatment will be assessed to determine the level of detoxification services
      required. To the greatest extent possible, patient detoxification will be managed on an outpatient basis prior to
      inpatient treatment. Patients assessed as requiring medically managed detoxification (inpatient) will be entered into an
      appropriate medical facility.
18.24. Completing the Program:
      18.24.1. Successful Completion.
            Patients will not be considered to have successfully completed treatment until they meet the DSM criteria for
            early full remission. Based on DSM criteria, the TT determines patient progress toward agreed-upon goals and
            issues as stated in the treatment plan and determines when the patient is effectively in recovery and no longer
            requires program resources.
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                           439

      18.24.2. Failing the Program:
            18.24.2.1. The TT determines a patient to have failed the program based on a demonstrated pattern of
            unacceptable behavior, inability, or unwillingness to comply with their treatment plan, or involvement in
            alcohol or drug-related incidents after receiving initial treatment. The determination a patient has failed
            treatment is based on the patient‘s repeated failure to meet and maintain Air Force standards (behavior), rather
            than solely on the use of alcohol. An individual who has failed the ADAPT Program will be considered for
            administrative separation by his or her commander.
            18.24.2.2. Decisions regarding aftercare services will be based on a current assessment of status and will
            include establishment of an aftercare treatment plan identifying specific goals, interventions, and means to
            assess interventions.
18.25. Management of Substance Abusers.
      The commander is responsible for all personnel and administrative actions pertaining to patients involved in the
      ADAPT Program, to include assignment availability, promotion eligibility, reenlistment eligibility, Personnel
      Reliability Program, security clearance, etc. Application of administrative restrictions should be based on the
      establishment of an unfavorable information file or control roster resulting from the member‘s unacceptable behavior
      and not solely based on their involvement in the ADAPT Program.
18.26. The Line of Duty (LOD) Determination.
      A member‘s SA misconduct can lead to an LOD determination. An LOD determination is a finding made after an
      investigation into the circumstances of a member‘s illness, injury, disease, or death. The finding concludes (1) whether
      or not the illness, injury, or disease existed prior to service (EPTS) and if an EPTS condition was aggravated by
      military service; (2) whether or not the illness, injury, disease, or death occurred while the member was absent from
      duty; and (3) whether or not the illness, injury, disease, or death was due to the member‘s own misconduct. The LOD
      determination protects the interests of both the member and the United States Government. An LOD determination
      may impact disability retirement and severance pay, forfeiture of pay, period of enlistment, as well as veteran benefits.
      Additional guidance may be found in AFI 36-2910, Line of Duty (Misconduct) Determination.

Section 18E—Tobacco Use
18.27. Air Force Goal for Tobacco Use.
      The Air Force‘s goal is a tobacco-free force. Tobacco use is the single most preventable cause of disease and death in
      the United States. Every year, in the United States, tobacco use is responsible for about 1 in 5 deaths (about 443,000
      deaths per year; an estimated 49,000 of these deaths are from secondhand smoke exposure).
18.28. Effects of Tobacco Use:
      18.28.1. Optimal health and total fitness are force multipliers and critical to the military mission. Tobacco use,
      including but not limited to cigarettes, cigars, spit tobacco (also known as smokeless tobacco or ―chew‖), and
      electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), is inconsistent with the Air Force‘s goal of a mission-ready, healthy and fit force.
      Tobacco use affects all bodily systems, not just the mouth and lungs. Some types of cancer, cardiovascular diseases
      and many types of other diseases, have been linked to tobacco use. For the military member, tobacco use decreases
      endurance, night vision and fine motor coordination (for example, the coordination needed to hold a weapon steady),
      increases the risk of injuries (such as fractures) and post-operative respiratory complications, and impairs (or slows)
      wound healing. Additionally, the Environmental Protection Agency classifies tobacco smoke as a class ―A‖
      carcinogen. This means smoking causes cancer. Smoking is an obvious cancer threat to the smoker; but, more
      importantly, it poses a cancer threat to the individual who chooses not to smoke. Tobacco not only harms the user but
      can also cause cancer or contribute to cardiovascular disease in those who breathe the exhaled smoke called
      environmental tobacco smoke.
      18.28.2. While studies by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health have
      shown a decline in cigarette smoking, the use of other forms of tobacco has significantly increased. The increased use
      of smokeless tobacco is based on the faulty assumption it is less hazardous. Smokeless tobacco actually contains 28
      different cancer-causing agents (carcinogens). Oral cancers affect 30,000 people annually, and one person dies every
      hour as a result of this disease. The 5-year survival rate is very low: only 50 percent of persons are alive at 5 years
      after diagnosis.
      18.28.3. Nicotine found in tobacco products is addictive. Nearly one-half of all smokers in the United States have tried
      to quit in the past year. Because of the powerful physical and psychological addiction, quitting can be a challenge. The
440                                                                                  1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
      longer one uses tobacco, the more difficult cessation can be. Therefore, never using products containing nicotine is the
      best prevention. The U.S. Surgeon General has found that nearly 100 percent of adults who smoke every day started
      smoking when they were 26 years of age or younger, reinforcing prevention in our younger Airmen is critical to
      reducing tobacco prevalence in the Air Force.
18.29. Cost of Tobacco Use to the Air Force.
      The significant costs associated with tobacco use are both physical and financial. TRICARE has estimated that
      tobacco use costs the DoD $1.6 billion annually because of increased healthcare utilization and decreased work
      productivity (due to smoking breaks and illness). No less significant is the fact that the cost of smoking a pack a day
      for a year is 1-month‘s base pay for an airman basic.
18.30. Air Force Standards.
      AFI 40-102, Tobacco Use in the Air Force, expands tobacco-free environments. Tobacco use on a military installation
      is restricted to designated tobacco areas (DTA). Tobacco use is prohibited on military treatment facility (MTF)
      campuses; within 50 feet of a building entry, sidewalk, or parking lot; within 100 feet of a playground; on all
      recreational facilities, including athletic complexes, golf courses, and beaches, unless the installation commander
      designates a DTA; in all lodging rooms, lodging and unaccompanied housing (UH) common areas, and temporary
      lodging facility units; and family housing if serviced by a common air-handling unit. Installation commanders are
      authorized to designate all UH housing as nonsmoking. The Air Force prohibits all students of formal training courses
      from using tobacco products while in duty uniform. Not using tobacco should be the Air Force norm to promote
      mission readiness, health, and productivity. Commanders are expected to support Airmen trying to quit tobacco
      products. Installation health promotion programs offered through the HAWC provide strategies for education,
      motivation, and intervention to discourage tobacco use. Formal, structured tobacco cessation programs designed to
      assist members in breaking the addiction to tobacco products are available at the HAWC.

Section 18F—Medical Care
18.31. The Military Health System (MHS):
      18.31.1. The MHS is a unique partnership of medical educators, medical researchers, and healthcare providers and

            18.31.4.4. Building a bridge to peace through humanitarian support.
            18.31.4.5. Becoming a nationally recognized leader in prevention and health promotion.
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                        441

18.32. TRICARE:
        18.32.1. Program.
            TRICARE is the health care program serving active duty service members and retirees of the uniformed
            services, their family members, survivors and certain former spouses worldwide who are registered in the
            Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS). TRICARE is also available to ARC members and
            their families (benefits will vary depending on sponsor‘s military status). As a major component of the MHS,
            TRICARE brings together the worldwide health resources of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, and
            commissioned corps of the public health service (referred to as direct care), and supplements this capability
            with networks of civilian health professionals, institutions, pharmacies, and suppliers (referred to as purchased
            care) to provide access to high-quality health care services while maintaining the capability to support military
            operations.
      18.32.2. TRICARE Mission.
            To enhance DoD and national security by providing health support for the full range of military operations and
            sustaining the health of all those entrusted to our care.
      18.32.3. TRICARE Vision.
            To be a world-class health care system that supports the military mission by fostering, protecting, sustaining,
            and restoring health.
18.33. Medical Readiness.
      TRICARE enhances medical readiness by:
      18.33.1. Promoting the health and well-being of our forces.
      18.33.2. Providing preventive care and excellent medical care.
      18.33.3. Enabling medics to maintain skills during peacetime for ultimate medical readiness during wartime.
      18.33.4. Ensuring the ARC has access to quality medical care to promote their medical readiness.
      18.33.5. Providing access to medical care for members and their families stationed away from military treatment
      facilities.
      18.32.6. Taking care of family members at home so uniformed service members can take care of the mission.
18.34. TRICARE Regions.
      TRICARE is available worldwide and is managed in four separate regions: three in the United States and one overseas
      (that is divided into three main areas). The three U.S. regions include North, South, and West. The overseas regions
      include TRICARE Eurasia-Africa, TRICARE Latin America and Canada, and TRICARE Pacific.
18.35. TRICARE Plans.
      Several health plan options are available to TRICARE beneficiaries. Availability for each depends on the beneficiary‘s
      status and residence. The three primary healthcare options offered to eligible beneficiaries are: TRICARE Prime,
      TRICARE Standard, and TRICARE Extra. Local TRICARE service centers and beneficiary counseling and assistance
      coordinators in the medical treatment facility are available to help beneficiaries decide which option is best. Go to
      http://www.tricare.mil for additional information.
      18.35.1. TRICARE Prime.
            TRICARE Prime is a managed care option offering the most affordable and comprehensive coverage. When the
            beneficiary enrolls in TRICARE Prime, he/she is assigned a primary care manager (PCM), either from a MTF
            or from the TRICARE network, who manages and provides most of his/her care. This PCM will refer the
            enrollee to a specialist for care he or she cannot provide, coordinate with the regional contractor for
            authorization, find a specialist in the network, and file claims on the enrollee‘s behalf. There are time and
            distance standards for care including wait times for urgent, routine and specialty care. Other benefits include
            enhanced vision and preventive services and travel reimbursement for some specialty care. Active duty
            members and their families do not pay enrollment fees, annual deductibles, or copayments for care in the
            TRICARE network. TRICARE Prime is the only option available to active duty service members (ADSM) and
            enrollment is not automatic.

            18.35.1.1. TRICARE Prime Remote (TPR). TPR is a TRICARE Prime option for those ADSMs and active
            duty family members (ADFM) who live and work 50 miles or an hour‘s drive from an MTF (in TPR-designated
            ZIP codes).
            18.35.1.1.1. ADSMs. ADSMs under full-time orders with a permanent duty assignment who meet TPR
            qualifications are required to enroll in TPR. In some cases, where geographic boundaries create undue hardship
            for travel, ADSMs living closer than 50 miles may be eligible for TPR.
            18.35.1.1.2. ADFMs. ADFMs residing with their TPR-enrolled sponsors are eligible for TRICARE Prime
            Remote for active duty family members (TPRADFM) and must enroll to enjoy the benefit. Family members
            enrolled in TPRADFM may remain enrolled even if the sponsor receives unaccompanied permanent change of
            station orders as long as they continue to reside in the same TPR location.
      18.35.2. TRICARE Standard and Extra.
            TRICARE Standard and Extra is a fee-for-service plan available to all nonactive duty beneficiaries throughout
            the United States. Enrollment is not required and coverage is automatic as long as the beneficiary‘s information
            is current in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System. When using TRICARE Standard and Extra,
            the beneficiary may visit any TRICARE-authorized provider, network, or non-network. Care at MTFs is on a
            space-available basis only. Referrals for any type of care are not needed but some services may require prior
            authorization. The type of provider seen determines which option is being used and how much the beneficiary
            will pay out of pocket. If visiting a non-network provider, the Standard option is being used. If visiting a
            network provider, the Extra option is being used. If using the Extra option, the beneficiary will pay less out of
            pocket and the provider will file claims for the beneficiary. See Figure 18.4 for more information.

       out-of-pocket expenses for TRICARE covered services is $1,000 per active duty family per fiscal year
       (deductibles, cost shares, copayments, etc.).

      18.35.3. TRICARE Young Adult.
            The TRICARE Young Adult (TYA) program is a premium-based health care plan available for purchase by
            qualified dependents. TYA offers TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Standard coverage worldwide. TYA
            includes medical and pharmacy benefits, but excludes dental coverage.
            18.35.3.1. Who is eligible? If you are an adult-age dependent, your sponsor‘s status determines whether you are
            eligible for TYA Prime and/or TYA Standard. You may generally purchase TYA coverage if you are all of the
            following:
AFPAM36-2241        1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                           443

             18.35.3.1.1. A dependent of a TRICARE-eligible uniformed service sponsor.
             18.35.3.1.2. Unmarried.

      TDP is a voluntary premium-based insurance plan managed by United Concordia Companies, Inc. (UCCI). UCCI
      offers dental coverage for a wide range of services to ADFMs, selected Reserve, individual ready Reserve members,
      and their eligible family members. ADSMs (and Reservists called to active duty for more than 30 days) are not eligible
      for the TDP. Civilian dentists provide the care under the TDP. Either the dentists or the patient may file claims.
      Sponsors pay a monthly premium through payroll deduction or direct billing in certain circumstances and pay a cost-
      share for some services provided.

Section 18G—Suicide Prevention
18.37. Suicide Defined.
      Suicide is defined as the act of deliberately killing oneself, based on the victim‘s intent and an understanding of the
      probable consequences of his or her actions.
18.38. Suicide Demographics.
      In any given year, roughly 30,000 Americans commit suicide, almost twice as many as are killed by homicide. The
      military is not exempt from the problem of suicide. Suicide is the third leading cause of death among Regular Air
      Force personnel, following death by accidents. During 2011, 42 Regular Air Force Airmen died by suicide. This
      equals a rate of 12.8 suicides for every 100,000 Airmen. Additionally, 27 Reserve component Airmen and 17 civilian
      employees died by suicide. Within the Air Force the most common stressors seen in the lives of those who die by
      suicide are relationship problems, legal problems, mental health problems, financial hardship and work problems.
      Recent Air Force data shows that all age groups at risk for suicide, with those over 35 at equal risk to those under 24.
      Some of Airmen who died by suicide were barely into their careers, while others were well beyond retirement
      eligibility. Although all ethnic, racial, age, and rank groups were represented among Air Force suicides, men die by
      suicide at a rate four times greater than that of women. Each suicide represents an unacceptable loss to the family and
      friends of these Airmen as well as to the Air Force.
18.39. Effect on the Military.
      When suicides occur in the Air Force, they may generate a number of serious problems, which include:
      18.39.1. First and foremost, an unnecessary loss of human life.
      18.39.2. Second, distress to the victim‘s family and military community.
      18.39.3. Third, a direct impact on mission sustainability through loss of the victim‘s skills, experience, and
      productivity.
      18.39.4. Finally, the loss to the Air Force includes the economic value invested in the victim: the loss of anticipated
      services, training costs, and the cost associated with replacing the victim.
18.40. Dynamics of Suicide.
      Researchers studying suicide have developed a model to help us understand why someone may choose to end their
      lives. There are two personal perceptions that place someone at risk for suicide. The first is a perception of a lack of
      belongingness with or connectedness to others. This could be related to a lack of close friends or a failed marriage or
      dating relationship or even of a strong connection to the Air Force. The feeling that one does not belong or fit in
444                                                                                   1 OCTOBER 2013            AFPAM36-2241
      anywhere can be extremely painful and difficult to live with. In our culture we must do all in our power to help
      members of the Air Force team feel that they do belong and are important parts of our team. The second perception
      that puts one at risk for suicide is the sense that they are a burden to those around them. This can often be the case
      when someone feels that they are depressed and weighing down those around them, or can no longer be as productive
      or as efficient as they would like to be. This can also occur when individuals are experiencing military or civilian legal
      problems that threaten their careers. In addition to these perceptions of not belonging and of being a burden to others, a
      final factor that leads to suicide is the development of the ability to take your own life. Committing suicide is a
      frightening step to take and requires some preparation. Acquiring this capability is the third important piece in the
      dynamics of suicide. This step can take several forms. The most common in the Air Force is the acquisition of a
      firearm. For others it may be purchasing rope or acquiring medications for an overdose. Making such purchases can be
      warning signs that should be questioned by peers, friends, or supervisors. Those who already possess the means or
      have training in the use of lethal means may be at more risk for suicide. It is important to recognize that anyone, no
      matter how well they have dealt with military or personal stress in the past, could become suicidal if confronted with
      stressors or problems that overwhelm their ability to cope and leave them feeling alone and a burden to others.
18.41. Suicides Are Preventable.
      While not every suicide can be avoided, definite steps can be taken by Air Force personnel to reduce the number of
      suicides. Even though individual suicides can be difficult to predict, enough is known about the context of military
      suicides and the risk factors associated with them that realistic and effective preventive efforts are possible and should
      be publicized with all the force and effectiveness of other command initiatives. Suicide is a frightening step to take;
      most people who consider suicide do so only after other efforts to cope with or manage their problems have failed and
      they feel that they have no other options. It is in this stage that individuals considering suicide may be most open to
      assistance and support from a wingman, friend, or professionals.
18.42. Risk Factors and Stress Indicators of Suicide.
      Common risk factors include severe, prolonged, or unmanageable stress; difficulty coping or functioning; lack of
      social support or social isolation; escalating alcohol or drug use; difficulty sleeping and feelings of hopelessness or
      depression.
18.43. Mental Health Problems.
      From calendar year (CY) 2009 through CY 2011 more than 50 percent of Airmen who died by suicide were receiving
      treatment for mental health concerns. Depression, along with other mental illnesses, is a significant risk factor
      associated with suicide. While depression may have a biochemical basis for some people, for others it may arise from
      conditions such as marital problems, financial difficulties, work-related problems, or substance abuse. Although
      identifying depression as a risk factor is important, it may be even more important to identify the basis and nature of
      the individual‘s depression. Figure 18.5 identifies some signs of distress that can help determine if someone is
      suffering from depression.

 Depression                       Hopelessness                  Poor personal hygiene            Weight loss

18.44. Legal Problems.
      Since CY09, 34 percent of Airmen who died by suicide were involved in legal difficulties of one kind or another at the
      time of their deaths. Being under investigation for a suspected criminal offense, especially if the crime is highly
      embarrassing, is extremely stressful. Compounding the stress is the uncertainty of what the legal outcome will be;
      many Airmen under investigation expect the worst. Legal problems almost always entail career problems and are often
      cause for administrative action by the Air Force. Thus, military members facing serious legal problems often worry
      about public disgrace and a very real threat to their careers, or their ability to find work after separation from the Air
AFPAM36-2241        1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                         445

      Force. Depending on the crimes they are accused of, military members may be removed from their unit, or be rejected
      by their family and friends. This can create a sense of not belonging or being a burden to others. For some, this is
      simply more than they can bear.
18.45. Financial Problems.
      Many Air Force suicide victims were experiencing significant financial problems at the time of their deaths. Financial
      problems can be a sign of distress. Air Force commanders are frequently contacted concerning the financial
      indebtedness of their subordinates or their failure to honor financial obligations. Alert commanders often recognize
      this as being symptomatic of a broader pattern of ineffective coping behavior, or poor decision-making. Financial
      problems can also be a symptom of other problems such as gambling or substance abuse. As such, it has the potential
      to be another point of intervention that might collectively reduce the overall suicide rate within the Air Force.
18.46. Relationship and Work Problems.
      Since CY09, 54 percent of Airmen who died by suicide experienced a failed relationship in the months prior to their
      death; 25 percent experienced work-related problems. Many experienced both work and relationship problems. In
      some cases, the victims brought their personal problems to work and, as a result, added them to their jobs. In other
      cases, the victims took work-related problems home and added them to their personal problems. This is a particularly
      dangerous combination because it leaves the victim with virtually no safe haven. A healthy, happy relationship can
      serve an important protective function against many other kinds of stress, but when relationships fail their loss can
      make other stressors much more difficult to manage. Every Airman should engage with those who are experiencing
      relationship problems to ensure they manage the problems in a productive manner.
18.47. Signs of Distress.
      The risk factors noted above are factors that are internal to the person experiencing them and may not always be easily
      recognized by those around them. However when people are experiencing significant stress, or even thoughts of
      suicide, they may demonstrate signs that they are in distress. When these are observed in a fellow Airmen, friend, or
      family member, they should prompt you to ask about what may be troubling the person.
18.48. Suicide—The Event:
      18.48.1. The Process.
             Although some suicides are impulsive, most are not. Typically, the idea of suicide begins as a hypothetical
             solution to his or her problems and gradually suicide comes to be perceived as the only solution. As this process
             evolves, life is seen in increasingly narrower terms until problems are seen as hopeless, and suicide is viewed as
             the only way out. During this process, the individual may drop hints of suicidal ideation, both verbal and
             behavioral. These hints may include such things as acquiring the means to commit suicide, making suicidal
             remarks, giving away cherished possessions, writing a will, and being preoccupied with death.
      18.48.2. Communications before the Event.
             Many Airmen who die by suicide communicate their intention to kill themselves verbally and/or behaviorally.
             In some cases, these communications were clear. For example, one 19-year-old male Airman who died by
             suicide had been having serious marital problems. He told his coworkers he was so unhappy about his marriage
             problems that he was going to kill himself. Coworkers thought he was just ―blowing off steam‖ and took no
             action. In another case, a 19-year-old Airman who was abusing alcohol and depressed over relationship and
             financial problems. He told a friend he was going to kill himself and that is exactly what he did the following
             day. In other cases, the victim communicated suicidal intentions indirectly, often in the form of goodbye
             statements, making preparations such as writing a will or increasing life insurance, or by making comments that
             everyone would be better off if he were dead. Vague allusions to suicide are easy to dismiss because of their
             passive nature and because many people mistakenly believe that people who talk about suicide are not likely to
             actually do it. Every suicidal remark should be taken very seriously; someone‘s life may depend on it. The
             increase in the use of electronic communications presents another avenue for people to communicate suicidal
             thoughts or intentions, and new opportunities for alert wingmen to intervene. Facebook postings, Twitter, and
             text messages have become common ways in which those at risk for suicide have communicated their distress.
      18.48.3. Self Injury.
             Any self-injury intended to end one‘s life should be treated as a suicide attempt, regardless of how severe the
             actual injury was. The severity of the injury is not an accurate indicator of the lethality of the intent. Actual
             suicides often involve a combination of high lethality in the method selected and a low probability of rescue.
             Suicide attempts should be interpreted as a sign of serious distress warranting immediate medical attention.
446                                                                                   1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
            Even when the behavior appears to be manipulative, it is still sign of serious problem that needs to be
            addressed. Any level of self-injury should be taken seriously and addressed by mental health professionals.
      18.48.4. Time of Year.
            Statistics do not reflect a significant difference between the months in terms of number of suicides. Although
            widespread belief is that suicides increase during the holidays, no such relationship has been noted in the Air
            Force.
18.49. The Final Stage.
      For many Airmen who died by suicide, the final stage is the calm before the storm. After making up their minds to
      commit suicide, and having acquired the capability, they often become tranquil. Those around the victim are likely to
      correctly interpret this as the victim having solved his or her problems, but incorrectly assume that the solution is a
      positive one. Such a change in behavior or attitude should be questioned to ensure the individual is safe.
18.50. Why Suicide?
      To examine statistics on suicides is one thing, but to understand why an individual decides to take his or her life is
      another matter. The heart of the problem lies in the fact that suicide is a choice. Clearly, many victims give the matter
      considerable thought before they opt for self-destruction. Extreme stress can limit a person‘s ability to problem solve
      effectively and lead them to focus on suicide without being able to clearly see alternatives. Perhaps they believe the
      decision to die is their best choice. Perhaps they see it as their only choice. In most cases, individuals do not want to
      die, but want to end their current pain and distress, and they see suicide as the only option. Unfortunately, suicide is a
      permanent solution to an often temporary problem, and the Air Force has many resources to help people resolve
      problems in more constructive ways.
18.51. Military Leadership Role in Preventing Suicide:
      18.51.1. Suicide is not stopped in the emergency department of a hospital. It is stopped by addressing quality of life
      issues on a daily basis in the unit. Many would like to hand mental health specialists the responsibility for the suicide
      problem, but the nature of suicide does not lend itself to this kind of approach. Instead, effectively addressing suicide
      requires a carefully integrated and systematic community approach that prevents the factors that contribute to suicide,
      and identifies, diagnoses, and treats those at risk. This community approach relies on active leadership involvement in
      the full range of Air Force suicide prevention activities and on the engagement of concerned wingmen when they see
      other Airmen at risk.
      18.51.2. The military is a unique community governed by procedures and customs unlike those found in most civilian
      communities. An important element of leadership includes responsibility to and for subordinates along with a
      commitment to the mission. The military is one of the few communities to have the authority to compel behavior by
      the force of law. However, just as military commanders have the authority to compel behavior, they also have a
      corresponding responsibility for the health, well-being, and morale of their subordinates. This requirement applies all
      the way from the four-star generals to the front-line supervisor. Military leaders have a major moral and legal
      obligation for managing the welfare of their people.
      18.51.3. More importantly, the obligations of leadership cannot be transferred up the chain or across organizational
      lines to such specialists as psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, or chaplains. These specialists provide their
      services in support of command responsibility. Since CY09, 30 percent of the Airmen who died by suicide were seen
      by an Air Force mental health provider in the month prior to their deaths, but 100 percent were seen by their
      supervisors and peers the month prior to their deaths. This means that successful risk identification rests with the
      potential victim‘s most immediate associates and his or her first-line supervisor. The supervisor is a central player in
      suicide prevention. He or she not only supervises the individual‘s work, but is also in a position to see any changes in
      behavior or performance that may signal a problem. In fact, a large part of supervision is the successful management
      of human resources. Open communication between Airmen and their supervisors, especially in an environment where
      there is genuine concern for everyone‘s well-being, is vitally important.
      18.51.4. When front-line supervisors fail, it is usually for a specific reason. For example, supervisors who are
      exclusively mission-oriented may not pay enough attention to the personal needs of their subordinates. On the other
      hand, many supervisors do care about their subordinates‘ personal lives, but do not know how to recognize warning
      signs. Finally, there are supervisors who care about their subordinates‘ problems but try to protect them from the Air
      Force and fail to take the proper action when needed. For example, some supervisors tell subordinates to avoid seeking
      mental health assistance because it will hurt their career. There have been numerous cases when supervisors helped
      subordinates hide alcohol and drug abuse problems, helped them avoid installation helping services, and failed to
      follow human reliability standards in an effort to protect the person at risk, only to see the person take his or her own
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                          447

      life, or have the problems come to light through accidents or misconduct that had a lasting negative impact on his or
      her career. Seeking help appropriately does not have a negative career impact. In fact, it can improve performance and
      enable people to avoid problems. Supervisors should engage in problems early to ensure subordinates get the help they
      need to maintain peak performance.
      18.51.5. When risk is identified, appropriate professional resources can be obtained and applied to the problem. The
      Air Force has excellent helping resources whose purpose is to provide such services. Appropriate treatment will vary
      depending on the nature of the problem and degree of risk. Sometimes multiple approaches are needed (for example,
      involve psychologists, social workers, chaplains, marriage counselors, and others). Doing so requires commitment and
      assumption of responsibility at the command level, and dedicated competence at the support level. The Airman‘s
      Guide for Assisting Personnel in Distress provides resources to help supervisors and wingmen guide personnel to
      appropriate      helping      agencies.      It     is     available     at     the      following      Web      site:
      http://airforcemedicine.afms.mil/idc/groups/public/documents/webcontent/knowledgejunction.hcst?functionalarea=Le
      adersGuideDistress&doctype=subpage&docname=CTB_205851.
18.52. Psychological Services.
      The Air Force Suicide Prevention Program (AFSPP) is the Chief of Staff of the Air Force‘s (CSAF) program. The Air
      Force Surgeon General (AF/SG) serves as the office of primary responsibility (OPR) for the AFSPP.
      18.52.1. At the installation level, the mental health clinics typically assess individuals for whom suicide is a concern.
      Assessment and treatment by helping agencies such as mental health clinic are important, but the healthcare system
      can only act if it is aware of the problem. This means individuals at risk must either seek help themselves or be
      brought into the healthcare system by others. Although the healthcare system has an important role to play in suicide
      prevention, it does not own the problem. Suicide prevention is the responsibility of the entire Air Force community.
      18.52.2. A common fear is that seeking care at the mental health clinic will have a negative impact on the person‘s
      career. A 2006 study reviewing more than 1,000 self-referred mental health cases found that in 89 percent of cases
      there was no contact at all between the mental health clinic and the patients unit. In only 3 percent of the cases was
      there any type of negative impact. Confidentiality is governed by AFI 44-109, Mental Health, Confidentiality, and
      Military Law.
      18.52.3. Mental health providers must disclose safety (for example, suicidal or violent thoughts) and fitness for duty
      issues to commanders, but all other information is private. Thus, if an Airman‘s visit to a mental health provider is
      unrelated to safety and there is no mission impairment, the commander will not be contacted. Willingness to seek help
      when it is needed from mental health clinics, chaplains, or airmen and family readiness centers is a sign of good
      judgment and strength. It keeps people functioning at their best and can help them avoid problems that may occur if
      emotional, behavioral, or relationship problems are left unaddressed.
      18.52.4. In an effort to promote help-seeking by Airmen who are experiencing legal or administrative problems, the
      Air Force instituted the Limited Privilege Suicide Prevention Program according to AFI 44-109. This program allows
      suicidal Airmen who are under investigation to receive mental health care without risk of further incriminating
      themselves.
18.53. Every Airman’s Responsibilities.
      Based on a careful review of Air Force suicides, the following recommendations are offered:
      18.53.1. Be aware of the risk factors for suicide. The people most likely to spot a potential suicide victim are friends,
      coworkers, and the immediate supervisor. They are the ones most likely to notice signs of depression or hear suicidal
      comments. Communicate concerns with the chain of command. Post-suicide event reviews often find that no one had
      ―the whole picture.‖
      18.53.2. Encourage counseling for personal problems. Almost everyone goes through difficult times in life. Instead of
      ignoring the problem and forcing someone to suffer alone, encourage the individual to use the professional support
      services available on base. Encouraging early help-seeking behavior is an important part of supervision, leadership,
      and friendship.
18.54. Air Force Suicide Prevention Program:
      18.54.1. Suicide Prevention Program’s History.
            In May 1996, General Thomas S. Moorman, AF/CV, commissioned an integrated product team (IPT) composed
            of all functional areas of the Air Force. He requested General Charles H. Roadman (AF/SG) chair the 75-
            member committee and develop suicide prevention strategies. The suicide prevention IPT quickly realized
448                                                                                1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
           suicide was not a medical problem, but instead was a community problem. To establish an effective program,
           they designed a line program owned by the AF/CC with the USAF/SG as the OPR. The program was founded
           upon the concept that decreasing suicides required a community approach in which prevention and assistance
           were offered long before someone became suicidal.
      18.54.2. AFSPP Elements.
           In order to combat suicide, the suicide prevention IPT developed and implemented 11 far-reaching initiatives,
           as published in AFPAM 44-160, The Air Force Suicide Prevention Program.
           18.54.2.1. Leadership Involvement. Leaders build an environment that promotes healthy/adaptive behaviors,
           fosters the wingman culture, and encourages responsible help-seeking. Frequent messaging from senior Air
           Force leaders encourages unit commander and supervisor involvement, which is critical to program success.
           Commanders ensure adequate resources, policy development, implementation, and efficacy.
           18.54.2.2. Addressing Suicide Prevention through Professional Military Education (PME). PME provides
           periodic and targeted suicide prevention training for Airmen, specifically oriented to the individual‘s rank and
           level of responsibility. Leaders will understand what policies and practices promote or discourage help-seeking,
           and develop skills to detect at-risk individuals and intervene with Airmen under stress.
           18.54.2.3. Guidelines for Commanders: Use of Mental Health Services. Commanders are encouraged to
           partner and consult with the mental health staff about the health of their Airmen to improve their duty
           performance. Early self-referral yields the best outcome for the individual and the unit; however, there are
           circumstances when commanders must order a member to the MTF for a mental health evaluation (according to
           AFI 44-109), substance abuse assessment (according to AFI 44-121), or family advocacy issues (according to
           AFI 40-301, Family Advocacy). Commanders should be aware of the legal implications of different types of
           referrals and consult with the legal office as needed. ARC commanders will be familiar with available mental
           health options.
           18.54.2.4. Unit-based Preventive Services. Helping-agency professionals partner with unit leaders to provide
           services at the worksite to increase access; encourage help-seeking; and promote familiarity, rapport, and trust
           with Airmen and families. These services also improve unit cohesion and effectiveness.
           18.54.2.5. Wingman Culture. Wingmen practice healthy behaviors and make responsible choices and
           encourage others to do the same. Wingmen foster a culture of early help-seeking. Wingmen recognize the signs
           and symptoms of distress in themselves and others and take protective action.
           18.54.2.6. Investigative Interview Policy (Hand-off Policy):
           18.54.2.6.1. Airmen facing criminal or administrative action are at increased risk for suicide. They can easily
           feel isolated from family, friends, and other social supports when needing them most. Following an
           investigative interview, the Air Force investigators (for example, AFOSI, IG, SF, and MEO) are required to
           hand off the accused directly to the member‘s commander or first sergeant through person-to-person
           documented contact. The investigator will notify the unit representative that the individual was interviewed and
           is under investigation.
           18.54.2.6.2. When an investigating agent believes the member may present a risk of suicide, he or she must
           communicate that concern to the member‘s commander or first sergeant, who will then consider making a
           referral for a mental health evaluation and possible placement in the Limited Privilege Suicide Prevention
           (LPSP) Program. The commander or first sergeant is responsible for determining the member‘s emotional state
           and contacting a mental health provider if they suspect a risk of suicide.
           18.54.2.7. Post-Suicide Response (Postvention). Suicide impacts coworkers, families, and friends. Offering
           support early is associated with increased help-seeking behavior. Post-suicide responses are managed by unit
           leaders. Unit leaders support affected personnel through the grieving process, consulting with chaplains and
           mental health as needed. Care should be taken to avoid sensationalizing, glamorizing, romanticizing, or giving
           undue prominence to suicide. These practices are associated with suicide clusters, copycat suicides, and
           increased suicide rates. Following a suicide, unit leaders and helping professionals should reference Air Force
           post-suicide guidance.
           18.54.2.8. Community Action Information Board (CAIB) and Integrated Delivery System (IDS). CAIB
           and IDS provide a forum for the cross-organizational review and resolution of individual, family, installation,
           and community issues that impact the readiness of the force and the quality of life for Airmen and their families.
           The CAIB and IDS help coordinate the activities of the various base helping agencies to achieve a synergistic
           impact on community problems and reduce suicide risk according to AFI 90-501, Community Action
AFPAM36-2241    1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                         449

         Information Board and Integrated Delivery System. Emphasizing suicide prevention at the CAIB makes IDS
         initiatives at the wing, MAJCOM, and Air Force levels more targeted and effective.
         18.54.2.9. Limited Privilege Suicide Prevention (LPSP) Program. Members under criminal or administrative
         investigation are at increased risk for suicide. To encourage this high-risk group to seek help, LPSP Program
         affords increased legal protections and confidentiality. Members in this program are granted limited protection
         with respect to the information revealed during or generated by their clinical relationship with the mental health
         professional. It is important that providers, patients, and commanders understand the limited nature of LPSP
         protection. Information in the LPSP mental health file can be disclosed to other medical personnel for purposes
         of medical treatment, a member‘s confinement military commander, for legal proceeding against third parties
         and to other authorized personnel with an official need to know (for example, commanders) (according to AFI
         44-109).
         18.54.2.10. Commander Consultation Tools. Use of validated unit climate assessment tools is an excellent
         way for commanders to tap into the strengths and challenges within their organizations. Results from these
         instruments can assist commanders in choosing strategies to enhance the well-being and resilience of their
         Airmen. A number of assessment tools are currently available to all commanders at no cost to the unit. Some of
         these include the equal opportunity‘s unit climate assessment, the Airman and Family Readiness Center‘s
         (A&FRC) support and resilience inventory, and the Air Force culture assessment safety tool. Local IDS team
         members can help commanders select the best instrument for their unit. Additionally, IDS agencies can help
         interpret the results of the chosen tool and assist in developing a plan to leverage the strengths of our Airmen
         and address unmet needs within our units.
         18.54.2.11. Suicide Event Tracking and Analysis:
         18.54.2.11.1. Information on all Air Force suicides and suicide attempts are entered into a central database,
         currently the DoD Suicide Event Report (DoDSER), to identify suicide risk factors and trends. Collective
         analyses of useful findings are disseminated Air Force-wide for local application. This publication requires the
         collection and or maintenance of information protected by the Privacy Act (PA) of 1974. The authorities to
         collect and or maintain the records prescribed in this publication are Title 10, U.S.C., Section 136, Under
         Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, and Title 10, U.S.C., Section 8013, Secretary of the Air
         Force.
         18.54.2.11.2. In addition to those disclosures generally permitted under Title 5, U.S.C., Section 552a(b),
         Records Maintained on Individuals, of the Privacy Act of 1974, these records, or information
         contained therein, may specifically be disclosed outside the DoD as a routine use pursuant to 5 U.S.C.
         Section 552a(b)(3) as follows:
         18.54.2.11.3. Statistical summary data with no personally identifiable information may be provided to
         federal, state, and local governments for health surveillance and research.
         18.54.2.11.4. The DoD Blanket Routine Uses published at the beginning of the Office of the Secretary
         of Defense compilation of record system notices apply to this system, except when stipulated.
         18.54.2.11.5. A DoDSER will be submitted on the following populations:
         18.54.2.11.5.1. For suspected suicides of active duty or equivalent ARC members, data collection and post-
         suicide assessments will be completed at the decedent‘s installation. This review process will collect and report
         information to comply with the DoDSER requirements, established in 2008 by the Undersecretary of Defense
         for Personnel and Readiness.
         18.54.2.11.5.2. All active duty Air Force personnel who attempt suicide.
         18.54.2.11.5.3. All federalized status (Title 10 U.S.C., Armed Forces) ARC personnel who attempt suicide.
         18.54.2.11.5.4. Active full time ANG personnel (Title 32 U.S.C., National Guard) suspected of dying by
         suicide.
         18.54.2.11.5.5. Basic demographic data (DoDSER data fields 1-9) will be tracked on the following populations:
         18.54.2.11.5.6. All Department of Air Force civilian employee personnel suspected of dying by suicide.
         18.54.2.11.5.7. All Selected Reserve (SELRES) and traditional ARC members suspected of dying by suicide
         while in civilian status or during a unit training assembly.
450                                                                                   1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
             18.54.2.11.5.8. MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs, and the ANG have the authority to conduct additional reviews on
             suicides by civilians and reserve members not in Title 10 status within their commands.
             18.54.2.11.5.9. A DoDSER will be completed within 30 days of the date of hospitalization or evacuation, or
             within 60 days of the date the event was determined to be a suicide for active duty service members and 90 days
             for activated guardsmen and reservists
             18.54.2.11.5.10. For reportable events that occur in a deployed setting the DoDSER will be completed at the
             service member‘s home station.
18.55. Effective Suicide Prevention.
      Suicide prevention is everyone‘s responsibility. For effective suicide prevention, we need to create a culture that
      encourages early help-seeking behavior and develop a community that provides assistance long before someone
      becomes suicidal.
      18.55.1. The Ask, Care, and Escort (ACE) Model.
             To facilitate personal engagement in suicide prevention, the Air Force has developed this very simple acronym,
             ACE, to help people remember the key steps.
             18.55.1.1. Ask. When you see or hear any of the warning signs discussed in this section, or are aware of risk
             factors in someone‘s life, ask questions to learn more about the person‘s problems or concerns. If you have any
             concerns about someone‘s safety, calmly but directly ask the question ―Are you thinking of killing yourself?‖
             Some people worry that such a question might put the idea of suicide in a person‘s head, but this is not the case.
             Asking about suicide gives people permission to talk about a subject that may otherwise be difficult to bring up.
             Do not promise to keep thoughts of suicide a secret. It is important to share these concerns with professionals
             who can help the person.
             18.55.1.2. Care. It is important to show caring and concern for those at risk. Simply taking the time to ask about
             problems, and asking specifically about suicide shows caring and concern. If someone acknowledges thoughts
             of suicide, listen to them and allow them to share what is troubling them. Avoid judgmental statements, such as
             ―you couldn‘t do something so stupid‖ or immediately trying to solve their problem or talk them out of suicide.
             If they have shared thoughts of suicide with you, accept that they are in distress, listen to their concerns, and
             begin the process of getting them help. Another way of showing concern is to attempt to remove any means of
             self-harm, such as weapons or medications. If a weapon is present, arrange to have it put away, preferably out
             of sight, or encourage the person to leave the room or house where the weapon is located. If the person will not
             let go of the weapon, contact emergency services for support.
             18.55.1.3. Escort. After asking about suicide and beginning to show concern, the final step is to escort the
             person to the person or agency that can provide appropriate assistance. Do not leave him or her alone, or send
             the person alone to a chaplain or mental health clinic as he or she may change his or her mind on the way. At
             most bases, chaplains and mental health professionals are on call through the command post, and evaluations
             can be conducted in local emergency rooms if on-base services are not accessible. If an individual at risk will
             not agree to go with you, you should contact your chain of command or emergency services for help to ensure
             the person‘s safety.
             Note: By understanding the risk factors and warning signs of suicide, as well as how to intervene with someone
             at risk, you can play your part in reducing suicides across the Air Force.

Section 18H—Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
18.56. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Components.
Most individuals who experience a traumatic event do not develop PTSD. While it is common after an event to experience
posttraumatic stress symptoms, the symptoms are usually transient and resolve themselves within a short period of time. For
a small subset of individuals, these symptoms do not resolve and they develop into PTSD. PTSD involves six components:
exposure to a traumatic event, re-experiencing the event (nightmares, flashbacks), avoidance or emotional numbing,
persistent arousal symptoms (hypervigilance), symptom duration of greater than 1 month, and significant distress or
impairment.
18.57. PTSD Prevalence.
      PTSD rates have been relatively low among total force Airmen. PTSD symptoms are four to five times more frequent
      with combat exposure. Certain occupations are more likely to be exposed to trauma (Security Forces, Explosive
      Ordnance Disposal, medics) and have higher incidences of PTSD.
AFPAM36-2241         1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                           451

18.58. Prevention.
      Prevention of PTSD is achieved through screening and training:
      18.58.1. The Air Force screens Airmen before and after each deployment to assess whether followup for mental health
      concerns is necessary.
      18.58.2. Deploying Airmen receive training on recognizing PTSD and how to intervene or seek treatment when
      necessary.
      18.58.3. The installation traumatic stress response team can provide ‗pre exposure preparation‘ training for mission
      sets that have higher probability of exposure.
      18.58.4. Deploying Airmen receive Airman resilience training before and after deployment which focuses on
      adaptation to the deployed mission, dealing with adversity, and reintegrating with family/work after the deployment.
      18.58.5. ―At risk‖ career fields are identified for targeted interventions, including the deployment transition center,
      which is a 2-day reintegration program en route from the deployed location to home station for high exposure mission
      sets.
      18.58.6. Units that have a moderate or high chance of being exposed to a traumatic event as part of their duties can
      enhance their psychological resilience with the following preparation principles:
             18.58.6.1. Engage in Realistic Training. Train using simulated or actual exposure to realistic events, such as
             body handling, survival training, and mock captivity training.
             18.58.6.2. Strengthen Perceived Ability to Cope. Discuss reasons for realistic training. Enhance personal self-
             efficacy by reinforcing training to competence. Teach coping mechanisms during training in order to strengthen
             coping skills in anticipation of actual trauma.
18.59. Treatment.
      Today, there are effective treatments available for PTSD. Cognitive behavioral therapy appears to be the most
      effective type of counseling for PTSD. The Air Force provides two forms of cognitive behavioral therapy to Airmen
      with PTSD: cognitive processing therapy and prolonged exposure therapy. There is also a similar kind of therapy
      called eye movement desensitization and reprocessing that is used for PTSD. Medications have also been shown to be
      effective. A type of drug known as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, which is also used for depression, can be
      an effective adjunct treatment for PTSD. The majority (75 percent) of PTSD patients never require a medical board.

Section 18I—Stress Management
18.60. Stress Defined.
      At some point in your life, you have probably experienced stress. Long work days, increased deployments, and
      financial issues are just a few of the things that can make you feel stressed. The frequency of stress and the significant
      negative effect it can have on people and organizations make it a major concern of enlisted leaders at all levels. At the
      organizational level, it is important because it can negatively affect performance, organizational effectiveness, and
      mission accomplishment. However, on a personal level, experiencing stress over an extended period of time can lead
      to health problems and affect your overall quality of life. Therefore, it is important, personally and professionally, to
      recognize stress and learn how to manage it effectively.
      18.60.1. Stress is a dynamic concept that dates back to earlier this century. According to Jerrold S. Greenberg in his
      book Comprehensive Stress Management, the concept of stress is based on the research of two individuals named
      Walter Cannon and Hans Selye. Cannon, a physiologist at Harvard Medical School, was the first person to describe
      the body‘s reaction to stress. He identified this reaction as a response to a perceived threat that prepared the body for
      flight or fight. Later research conducted by Selye, an endocrinologist widely regarded as the father of stress research,
      concluded that the body‘s reaction to stress was the same regardless of whether the source was good or bad, positive or
      negative. He also provided us with a useful definition of stress. According to Selye, stress can be defined as ―the
      nonspecific response of the body to any demand made upon it.‖ The demand in Selye‘s definition is commonly called
      a stressor.
      18.60.2. A stressor can be more accurately defined as any factor (demand) that has the potential to cause stress. This
      factor can be positive, such as getting promoted, or negative, such as getting fired. Whether the factor is positive or
      negative, it still causes stress. Selye labeled the stress experienced from positive factors eustress. Eustress results from
      exhilarating experiences and is the stress of winning and achieving. He labeled the stress experienced from negative
452                                                                                    1 OCTOBER 2013           AFPAM36-2241
      factors distress. Distress is the stress of losing, failing, overworking, and not coping effectively. When you start to feel
      ‗stressed out,‘ distress is usually the type of stress you are feeling.
      18.60.3. We are in daily contact with many types of stressors. For the most part, we can categorize them into two
      major areas: organizational stressors and extra-organizational stressors.
             18.60.3.1. Organizational stressors are the type of factors experienced in the work environment. For Airmen
             today, that could range from short-notice deployments to hazardous working conditions. Imagine how you
             would feel if your commander informed you that you would deploy in a week, or how you might feel if your
             work environment was bombarded with loud noises all day. If these types of situations regularly happen to you
             and you have not developed effective ways to cope with them, you could experience stress.
             18.60.3.2. Extra-organizational stressors are the type of factors experienced outside the work environment.
             Three major extra-organizational stressors are family issues, marital issues, and financial issues. Family issues
             can run the gamut from minor illness and conflicting roles in the family to a death in the family. Similarly,
             financial problems can run from the minor to the catastrophic. These types of stressors are important because
             while they usually occur outside of the duty section, if not properly managed, they can affect performance at
             work.
      18.60.4. How do you know if you are stressed? Stress reactions appear in three different categories: emotional,
      behavioral, and physical. The key to recognizing stress is to understand what is normal for you so that you can
      recognize when something has changed. The combined presence of symptoms determines the degree of the problem.
      Indicators (Figure 18.6) may be isolated reactions or combinations among the three categories. Finally, the duration,
      frequency, and intensity of the symptoms could indicate difficulty in dealing with stress.
Figure 18.6. Common Symptoms of Stress.
 Emotional                               Behavioral                               Physical
 Apathy                                  Appetite changes                         Frequent illness
 Anxiety                                 Increased arguments                      Headaches
 Depression                              Increased smoking                        High blood pressure
 Irritability                            Neglecting self-care                     Increased heart rate
 Job dissatisfaction                     Social withdrawal                        Physical exhaustion
 Memory problems                         Substance abuse                          Sleep disturbances
 Mental fatigue                          Violence                                 Weight gain/loss
      18.60.5. Being able to recognize the symptoms of stress is important, not only for yourself, but for your Airmen as
      well. The earlier you identify what stress does to your body and state of mind, the earlier you can employ stress
      reduction techniques.
      18.60.6. Stress management programs and methods vary, but they all tend to have common goals. Individual stress
      management methods aim at strengthening your ability to manage stressors and the stress response. Organizational
      stress management methods aim more at altering potential stressors themselves. Because organizational and extra-
      organizational stressors are interrelated and influence each other, attention to both stress management methods is
      vitally important.
18.61. Individual Stress Management Methods:
      18.61.1. Planning.
             You can reduce stress by identifying potential stressors before they cause problems. Once you identify stressors,
             you can develop strategies to achieve your goals while avoiding their effects. For example, if you are stressed
             by crowds and long lines, don‘t plan to visit the commissary on or just after payday. If you get extremely upset
             when you are recalled in the middle of the night, having the latest recall roster and procedures readily available
             at all times may help reduce the amount of stress you feel. While planning can‘t prevent stress that occurs as an
             event is happening, it is extremely valuable in preventing stress before a stressor occurs.
      18.61.2. Time Management.
             Not having enough time to complete a task can be a significant stressor for some people. If time management is
             an issue for you, you can reduce stress by using effective time management skills and tools, like developing a
             task list and prioritizing tasks.
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                               453

      18.61.3. Overload Avoidance.
            It is relatively simple for most people to eliminate, or at least reduce, the effects of overload-related stressors.
            For a start, identify and avoid busy work, delegate or empower others when possible, learn to say no, and
            attempt to negotiate unreasonable deadlines.
      18.61.4. Relaxation.
            Relaxation can help you manage stress and stay alert, energetic, and productive. When you relax, you reduce
            mind and body tension. By incorporating relaxation skills into your daily routines, you can train your body to
            respond differently to stress. Relaxation techniques, such as meditation, reading, and listening to music, can
            improve your heart rate, regulate your blood pressure, and decrease your respiratory rate. If you are
            experiencing stress in your life, taking the time to relax can reduce the negative effects of stress on your health.
      18.61.5. Exercise and Good Nutrition.
            Regular exercise combined with a healthy diet is an effective stress management technique. Exercise can
            provide an outlet for excess energy and tension caused by stress. Eating nutritious foods ensures your body has
            the nutrients it needs to manage stress, and helps prevent overeating. Exercising and balanced diet help your
            body become more resistant to the negative results of stress, such as high blood pressure, heart attacks, and
            frequent illness.
18.62. Organizational Stress Management Methods.
      As a supervisor, your management approach can help reduce your subordinates‘ stress levels. You can begin by
      identifying potential stressors in the work environment and developing strategies to remove or reduce them. Here are a
      few examples of organizational stress management methods you can use:
      18.62.1. Job Design.
            If you identify potential sources of stress associated with the job itself, ask yourself if there is a need for the task
            and if the task is feasible. If the task is not needed, work to eliminate it from the task load. If motivation is a
            problem, you can consider using elements of job enrichment in order to restructure the job to better
            accommodate the individual needs and abilities of your Airmen.
      18.62.2. Improving the Work Environment.
            Numerous physical factors within a work environment can be potential stressors. Some of these stressors cannot
            be eliminated, but you may be able to reduce them. Examine such environmental factors as temperature, noise,
            and light levels, and make necessary improvements.
      18.62.3. Improving Organizational Communication.
            A lack of information can be a significant stressor. Therefore, any attempt to improve communication can help
            lower individual stress levels. As a supervisor, you should do your best to keep your subordinates informed
            about anything that could impact their lives.
      18.62.4. Personnel Selection and Job Placement.
            Having the wrong person in a job can create a great deal of stress for the individual and others. When possible,
            you should carefully match individuals to the positions. In the military, this might not be the easiest thing to do,
            but you should keep in mind the potential stress-related benefits of having content people in the workplace.
      18.62.5. Substance Abuse Programs.
            Closely related to stress, substance abuse can have a dramatically negative effect on mission, morale, and
            readiness, to say nothing of people‘s health and well-being. All supervisors are responsible and accountable for
            managing substance abusers in accordance with applicable directives.

Section 18J—Redeployment Support Process
18.63. Purpose.
      The positive and sustained care, control, and discipline of each Airman is the purpose of the redeployment support
      process. The goal is to ensure personnel readiness throughout the air and space expeditionary force (AEF) cycle by
      providing timely support for our military members and their families. Redeployment support is an ongoing process,
454                                                                                    1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
      not a homecoming event. The intent is to provide continuous, integrated support from the area of responsibility (AOR)
      to home station and to assist in the transition from the deployed environment to family life and work site.
18.64. Recovery.
      After periods of arduous duty and protracted periods of deployment, a lengthy respite from the deployment
      environment has a beneficial effect on an individual‘s psychological and physical status. An immediate recovery
      period also provides time for the returning Airman to tend to personal needs neglected during lengthy periods away
      from home. Each MAJCOM is responsible for establishing and publishing personnel recovery (leave, passes,
      attribution, and retention) policies for returning combat forces. See AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program, for
      guidance.
18.65. Reconstitution.
      Although it is important to support returning forces as they transition back to their normal environment, they also must
      be reconstituted for further deployment possibilities, including surge requirements. This process entails planning that
      will return units back to full combat capability in a short time. While there is no one correct rule set for reconstitution
      planning, consideration must be given to prioritizing and restoring levels of consumables expended during the crisis,
      and recovering lost training. Every base/unit must assess its own situation based on such variables as the magnitude,
      duration, and intensity of a crisis, consumption rates, and the type of deployment location (fixed versus austere base).
      See AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations Planning and Execution, for further guidance on reconstitution.
18.66. Scope.
      The Air Force redeployment support process applies to deployed AOR and home stations. All personnel deployed to
      an AOR, to continental United States locations in support of contingencies, and to remote assignments are included.
      Key determinants for participation are lengthy family separation and significant family-related stressors prior to
      redeployment. CAIB- and IDS-helping agencies complete specified activities to support redeployed Regular Air
      Force, Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve, civilian personnel, their family members, and units during the AEF
      cycle. Readjustment from duty in the AOR requires structured recovery time and activities for members and families
      prior to leave or temporary duty.
18.67. Redeployment Support Process Timeline.
      Figure 18.7 provides a template for commander responses and actions, and CAIB and IDS members‘ activities at the
      critical redeployment, recovery, reconstitution, and spin-up/deployment junctures. Subsequent sections provide
      detailed information on roles and responsibilities.
18.68. Home Station CAIB and IDS Agency Responsibilities.
      Figure 18.7 outlines the AEF cycle, and specifies commander and CAIB or IDS agency critical juncture activities. The
      AEF on line (https://aef.afpc.randolph.af.mil) is a critical source of deployment information, education, and training.

AFPAM36-2241         1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                        455

      18.68.1. Personnel Readiness.
            Personnel readiness begins reintegration, and develops the reception station. Personnel readiness will ensure
            procedures are established to account for members returning from deployments. These procedures will be
            incorporated into installation reconstitution planning and the installation deployment plan. Returning units and
            individuals will inprocess with the personnel readiness function within 2 duty days of redeployment day. The
            personnel readiness function will update the date of return to home station for all individuals in deliberate and
            crisis action planning and execution segments on the date of notification of return according to AFI 36-3802,
            Personnel Readiness Operations.
      18.68.2. Chaplain Service.
            Chaplain service members support personnel, families, and base populations during contingencies according to
            AFI 52-104, Chaplain Service Readiness. At home station following deployment, chaplain service members
            provide followup support, reintegration and reunion ministries, and other programs to strengthen families and
            enhance individual spiritual health. Post-deployment services at Air Force Reserve Command wings will be
            coordinated with the reserve wing deployment support program point of contact.
      18.68.3. Airman and Family Readiness Center (A&FRC).
            The A&FRC provides mobility and deployment assistance to help single and married DoD personnel and
            families meet predeployment, deployment, and post deployment challenges, according to AFI 36-3009, Airman
            and Family Readiness Centers. Services help reduce stress and deal with separation and reintegration, increase
            individual and family morale and unit cohesion, and support operational readiness.
            18.68.3.1. A&FRCs use electronic media and hard copies to help develop reintegration educational material and
            provide materials support to the chaplain and mental health services in the AOR.
            18.68.3.2. During deployments, A&FRC staffs tailor support to commanders, units, and families; work with
            local school authorities and teachers to help them understand stressors unique to children of deployed military;
            provide myriad deployment support programs; and distribute commercial, printed materials addressing
            deployment. Upon request, one-on-one counseling is available. The A&FRC staff provides support to the
            parents and siblings of single Airmen.
            18.68.3.3. Post deployment assistance is linked to pre-deployment activities, particularly early intervention to
            educate families, single members, and units on concerns related to reintegration and reunion. The A&FRC staff
            monitors family coping skills, assists potential at-risk families, and collaborates with CAIB or IDS agencies to
            ensure smooth family reunions.
      18.68.4. Force Support Squadron and Family Member Program Protocols.
            These protocols help bases respond to increased childcare needs during contingencies and during the Air and
            Space Expeditionary Force cycle, according to AFI 34-248, Child Development Centers. Childcare providers
            receive training on caring for children who are experiencing family separation and reintegration, or whose
            parents are working extended hours.
18.69. Conclusion.

      This chapter began with the Air Force Fitness Program. Next, it included information on exercising and proper
      nutrition to create a healthy lifestyle. This chapter included information on substance abuse, tobacco use, medical care,
      suicide prevention, PTSD, stress management, redeployment and A&FRC programs. Air Force policy is to ensure Air
      Force members and their families are physically fit and of sound mind and body to enhance mission accomplishment.

                                                        Chapter 19
                                                        SECURITY
Section 19A—Overview
19.1. Introduction.
      Security applies to all members of the Air Force at all times. In certain positions, noncommissioned officers (NCO) are
      required to handle classified information; at other times, NCOs may be required to serve in a foreign country. Such is
      the diversity of security. This chapter covers information assurance, installation security, and antiterrorism (AT).
      These topics are essential to the Air Force mission and the security of all its resources. Along with information
      presented in Chapters 5, Emergency Management Program, and 6, Standards of Conduct, this information helps ensure
      Air Force forces are prepared to face any adversary.

Section 19B—Information Assurance (IA)
19.2. Information Assurance:
            19.2.1. Information assurance is everyone‘s responsibility. Personnel at all levels must ensure all Air Force
            information resources under their purview are protected in a manner consistent with threats and missions.
            Similarly, it is the duty of all personnel to accept and carry out their responsibilities to protect information and
            information systems by adhering to all applicable information assurance and related security policies and
            procedures.
            19.2.2. Information assurance refers to the measures that protect and defend information and information
            systems by ensuring their availability, integrity, confidentiality, authentication, and non-repudiation. These
            measures include providing for restoration of information and information systems by incorporating protection,
            detection, and reaction capabilities. Information assurance policy is based on fact-based operational risk
            assessments; total risk avoidance is not practical in many cases and, therefore, risk assessment and management
            is required.
            19.2.3. The Air Force implements and maintains the information assurance program to secure its information
            and information technology (IT) assets. The Air Force achieves these objectives through the effective
            employment of its core information assurance disciplines of communications security (COMSEC), computer
            security (COMPUSEC), and emissions security (EMSEC).
19.3. Computer Security (COMPUSEC):
      19.3.1. Definition.
            COMPUSEC consists of measures and controls that ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
            information systems assets including hardware, software, firmware, and information being processed, stored,
            and communicated. Compliance ensures measures are taken to protect all Air Force information system
            resources and information effectively and efficiently. Appropriate levels of protection against threats and
            vulnerabilities for information systems prevent denial of service, corruption, compromise, fraud, waste, and
            abuse.
      19.3.2. Information Systems.
            An information system is any telecommunications or computer-related equipment or interconnected system or
            subsystems of equipment used in the acquisition, storage, manipulation, management, movement, control,
            display, switching interchange, transmission, or reception of voice or data and includes software, firmware, and
            hardware.
      19.3.3. Countermeasures.
            Every Air Force information system has vulnerabilities (system security weaknesses) and is susceptible to
            exploitation (to gain access to information or disrupt critical processing). A countermeasure is an action, device,
            procedure, technique, or other measure that reduces the vulnerability to an acceptable and manageable level
            (mitigating the overall threat).
      19.3.4. Threats.
            Not all threats to our national security are conventional in nature. Potential adversaries increasingly rely on
            unconventional tactics to offset our superiority in conventional forces and technology. Information operations
458                                                                            1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
      (IO) and information warfare (IW) activities pose the greatest threats to communications and information
      systems. IO and IW attacks, including introduction of malicious codes, trapdoors, or viruses, could result in the
      loss of information and information system confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The loss of these key
      capabilities could disclose classified or sensitive information (including personally identifiable information
      [PII]), alter and delete mission-essential data, and destroy our communications and information systems.
      19.3.4.1. Malicious Logic Protection. The Air Force must protect information systems (server to workstation)
      from malicious logic (for example, virus, worm, Botnets, and Trojan horse) attacks. To achieve this, the Air
      Force applies an appropriate mix of preventive measures to include user awareness training, local policies,
      configuration management, and antivirus software. At a minimum, personnel must follow these preventive
      measures:
      19.3.4.1.1. Use antivirus software on all information systems.
      19.3.4.1.2. Scan all incoming or downloaded electronic traffic and files for viruses.
      19.3.4.1.3. Scan removable and fixed media prior to use.
      19.3.4.1.4. Report all virus attacks.
      19.3.4.1.5. Preserve any evidence in malicious logic incidents for ongoing investigations.
      19.3.4.1.6. Use government-owned computer systems for official use only.
      19.3.4.1.7. Do not surf unapproved Web sites on government-owned computer systems.
      19.3.4.2. Desktop and Workstation Security. This paragraph applies to all information systems used by only
      one individual at a time. The desktop or workstation may be operated as a standalone system or connected in a
      network environment. At a minimum, personnel must comply with these security requirements:
      19.3.4.2.1. Ensure user access to information system resources and information is based upon their security
      clearance and need to know. For access to systems and networks, use strong, two-factor authentication by
      combining the common access card (CAC) (possession-based) with a personal identification number (PIN)
      (knowledge-based). The CAC is the DoD identification card which contains an integrated circuit chip upon
      which public key infrastructure (PKI) certificates and keys reside. All individuals authorized a CAC will use the
      CAC and PIN, or an authorized alternate smart card token, to access nonsecure internet protocol router network
      resources. Passwords should only be used when support for CAC or other strong, two-factor authentication is
      not available.
      19.3.4.2.2. Protect against casual viewing of information. Place devices that display (or output) classified and
      sensitive information in a location that deters unauthorized individuals from reading the information. Use a
      secure screen saver and screen-lock any workstation left unattended. Once activated, access to the workstation
      requires strong, two-factor authentication. If a CAC is used for workstation access, remove it from the reader
      when workstations are unattended. If a secure screen saver or screen-lock is not available on the workstation,
      completely log off before leaving the workstation unattended.
      19.3.4.2.3. Protect the information system and data against tampering, theft, and loss. Provide protection from
      outsider threats by controlling physical access to the facilities, information systems, and data itself. Provide
      protection from insider and outsider threats by using installed security mechanisms (CAC removal lock feature,
      keyboard locks, secure screen savers, add-on security software, etc.) or by establishing controls for removal and
      secure storage of information from unattended information systems.
      19.3.4.3. Removable Media Control. This paragraph applies to all forms of storage media including, but not
      limited to, compact discs, external storage drives, and universal serial bus drives (memory sticks, jump drives,
      pen drives, etc.). These devices have memory storage capability and are categorized as removable media.
      Because of the capacity of their memory storage and their portable nature, these devices pose an increased risk
      of data tampering, theft, or loss. At a minimum, personnel must use these preventive measures:
      19.3.4.3.1. Safeguard, mark, and label removable media according to the requirements for the highest level of
      information ever contained on the media using applicable information security guidance.
      19.3.4.3.2. Restrict use of removable media containing sensitive information (to include PII) to locations that
      meet information protection and security policies. Contact your local security manager for additional security
      measures when removing these devices from secure locations. Do not store large amounts of PII (500 or more
      records) on these devices without proper approval as stated in current Air Force policy. The loss or theft of this
      much information may lead to identity theft and adversely impact our personnel.
AFPAM36-2241    1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                        459

         19.3.4.3.3. Report loss or suspected loss of removable media containing sensitive information according to
         applicable information security guidance from your local security manager or information assurance officer
         (IAO).
         19.3.4.3.4. Clear, sanitize, or destroy removable media used to store sensitive information before releasing to
         unauthorized personnel or outside DoD or Air Force control. Contact your local IAO for guidance and
         procedures.
         19.3.4.3.5. Use your local security guidance before attaching any removable media or storage device to an
         information system.
         19.3.4.3.6. Do not use disguised removable media or storage devices. Air Force policy defines disguised as a
         device designed to look like anything other than removable media or a storage device (for example, watch, pen,
         flashlight, etc.).
         19.3.4.4. Portable Electronic Devices (PED). PED is a generic term used to describe small electronic items
         with the capability of recording, storing, transmitting or processing information. It is becoming difficult to
         differentiate between these electronic devices since such examples include, but are not limited to, personal
         digital assistants, hand-held and laptop computers, cellular phones, email devices and audio or video recording
         devices. Most of these devices combine capabilities and functions together with wireless telecommunications,
         offering tremendous advantages for Air Force users. These capabilities and functions bring with them additional
         risks. Most of the preventive measures applicable to desktops, workstations, and even removable media also
         apply to PEDs. These additional measures help protect these devices and the information they store.
         19.3.4.4.1. Wireless-enabled PEDs must comply with requirements outlined in current Air Force wireless and
         wireless security policies before use.
         19.3.4.4.2. Do not use wireless-enabled PEDs for storing, processing, or transmitting classified information
         without proper approval, security mechanisms (encryption, etc.), and additional security measures. If you
         discover classified information was processed or maintained on an unclassified PED, notify your supervisor,
         security manager, or IAO to initiate security incident procedures. Personnel in the information assurance chain
         of command will determine the disposition of the contaminated PED (secure storage, destruction, etc.).
         19.3.4.4.3. Do not use wireless-enabled PEDs in areas where classified information is discussed or processed
         without coordination from the local security manager based upon the requirements established by information
         assurance personnel, the appropriate EMSEC authority, and cognizant security authority.
         19.3.4.4.4. When using wireless-enabled PEDs, operations security (OPSEC) and force protection should be
         considered before the adoption or implementation of any policy or procedure. OPSEC training and guidance
         may be obtained from your unit OPSEC manager.
         19.3.4.4.5. The Air Force prohibits connection of personally owned PEDs to the Air Force network. These
         devices may provide many benefits such as portability, flexibility, and increased productivity; however, since
         the Air Force has no control over their security features they introduce an entirely new set of risks. If an
         individual has a requirement to use a PED on the Air Force network, they must request issuance of a
         government-owned PED. See paragraphs 19.3.4.5 through 19.3.4.5.4 for additional information on any
         personally owned IT.
         19.3.4.5. Personally Owned IT (All Forms of Hardware and Software). Every Air Force member,
         government employee, and contractor must meet all security requirements to maintain the confidentiality,
         integrity, and availability of our data, systems, and networks. Personally owned hardware and software present
         risks which may degrade the required security posture.
         19.3.4.5.1. Do not use personally owned IT to process classified information. Personally owned IT with
         classified information will be confiscated and sanitized or destroyed according to current Air Force policy.
         19.3.4.5.2. Using personally owned IT for government work is strongly discouraged. However, it may be used
         for processing unclassified and sensitive information with justification and approval. Justification must include
         mission requirement, government availability, and rationale as to why personally owned information systems
         must be used. This includes systems maintained at a residence, services accessed, and information
         transportation methods (modem, Web mail, and or physical media used). Approval must follow current Air
         Force policy requirements.
460                                                                                     1 OCTOBER 2013     AFPAM36-2241
            19.3.4.5.3. Government-owned sensitive information must remain on government removable media or devices
            and be marked and protected according to the sensitive category as outlined in information security guidance.
            19.3.4.5.4. Do not use personally owned IT to store or process controlled unclassified information (CUI) and
            PII. Personally owned IT with CUI or PII will be confiscated and sanitized or destroyed according to current
            Air Force policy.
            19.3.4.6. Public Computing Facilities or Services. Do not use public computing facilities or services (Internet
            cafés and kiosks, hotel business centers, etc.) to process government-owned unclassified, sensitive or classified
            information. Public computing facilities or services include any IT resources not under your private or U.S.
            government control. Use of these resources to access Web-based government services (Outlook Web Access e-
            mail, Web applications, etc.) constitutes a compromise of login credentials and must be reported as a security
            incident according to current Air Force guidance on COMPUSEC.
            19.3.4.7. Phishing. Air Force personnel must be ever vigilant when viewing and reading email. More and more
            threats are coming via emails that have embedded scripts and false links that provide access for a hacker to
            control the user‘s computer or install malicious logic programs. This is a form of social engineering that our
            adversaries use to solicit information from Air Force members that can compromise the mission effectiveness of
            your organization. Emails that come from financial institutions asking for personal information should be
            deleted and reported to the appropriate financial institution‘s spam or phishing points of contact. Remember, at
            the minimum, users should:
            19.3.4.7.1. Never click on a hyperlink inside an email from an unknown source.
            19.3.4.7.2. Never download files attached to an email from an unknown source.
            19.3.4.7.3. Contact the sender of the email to verify if it is authentic.
19.4. Communications Security (COMSEC).
      COMSEC refers to measures and controls taken to deny unauthorized persons information derived from information
      systems of the U.S. government related to national security and to ensure the authenticity of such information systems.
      COMSEC protection results from applying security measures (i.e., crypto security, transmission security, and emission
      security) to communications and information systems generating, handling, storing, processing, or using classified or
      sensitive information, the loss of which could adversely affect the national security interest. COMSEC also entails
      applying physical security measures to COMSEC information or materials.
      19.4.1. Cryptosecurity.
            Cryptosecurity is a component of COMSEC resulting from the provision and proper use of technically sound
            cryptosystems.
      19.4.2. Transmission Security.
            Transmission security is a component of COMSEC resulting from the application of measures designed to
            protect transmissions from interception and exploitation by means other than cryptoanalysis. Examples of
            transmission security measures include using secured communications systems, registered mail, secure
            telephone and facsimile equipment, manual cryptosystems, call signs, or authentication to transmit classified
            information.
      19.4.3. Physical Security.
            Physical security is the part of COMSEC resulting from the use of all physical measures necessary to safeguard
            COMSEC material from access by unauthorized persons. Physical security measures include the application of
            control procedures and physical barriers. Physical security also ensures continued integrity, prevents access by
            unauthorized persons, and controls the spread of COMSEC techniques and technology when not in the best
            interest of the United States and its allies. Common physical security measures include verifying the need to
            know and clearance of personnel granted access, following proper storage and handling procedures, accurately
            accounting for all materials, transporting materials using authorized means, and immediately reporting the loss
            or possible compromise of materials.
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                        461

19.5. Emissions Security (EMSEC).
      EMSEC is protection resulting from all measures taken to deny unauthorized persons information of value that may be
      derived from the interception and analysis of compromising emanations from crypto equipment, information systems,
      and telecommunications systems. The objective of EMSEC is to deny access to classified and, in some instances,
      unclassified information that contain compromising emanations within an inspectable space.

Section 19C—Installation Security
19.6. Operations Security (OPSEC):
      19.6.1. OPSEC Defined.
            OPSEC is a process of identifying, analyzing, and controlling critical information indicating friendly actions
            associated with military operations and other activities to:
            19.6.1.1. Identify those actions that can be observed by adversary intelligence systems.
            19.6.1.2. Determine what specific indications could be collected, analyzed, and interpreted to derive critical
            information in time to be useful to adversaries.
            19.6.1.3. Select and execute measures that eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level the vulnerabilities of
            friendly actions to adversary exploitation.
            19.6.1.4. Closely integrate and synchronize with other influence operations capabilities and all aspects of the
            protected operations because OPSEC is a process and not a collection of specific rules and instructions that can
            be applied to every operation.
      19.6.2. Purpose.
            The purpose of OPSEC is to reduce the vulnerability of Air Force missions by eliminating or reducing
            successful adversary collection and exploitation of critical information. OPSEC applies to all activities that
            prepare, sustain, or employ forces during all phases of operations.
      19.6.3. Operational Context.
            Operational effectiveness is enhanced when commanders and other decision-makers apply OPSEC from the
            earliest stages of planning. OPSEC involves a series of analyses to examine the planning, preparation,
            execution, and post execution phases of any operation or activity across the entire spectrum of military action
            and in any operational environment. OPSEC analysis provides decision makers with a means of weighing how
            much risk they are willing to accept in particular operational circumstances in the same way as operations risk
            management allows commanders to assess risk in mission planning.
      19.6.4. Implementing OPSEC.
            Air Force forces can be under observation at their peacetime bases and locations, in training or exercises, while
            moving, or when deployed to the field conducting actual operations. OPSEC methodology provides systematic
            and comprehensive analysis designed to identify observable friendly actions that could betray intentions or
            capabilities. Therefore, OPSEC principles must be integrated into operational, support, exercise, and acquisition
            planning. OPSEC is incorporated into day-to-day activities to ensure a seamless transition to contingency
            operations. The OPSEC process consists of five distinct steps:
            19.6.4.1. Identify critical information.
            19.6.4.2. Analyze threats.
            19.6.4.3. Analyze vulnerabilities.
            19.6.4.4. Assess risk.
            19.6.4.5. Apply appropriate OPSEC measures.
      19.6.5. Sources of OPSEC Indicators.
            Sources of OPSEC indicators are friendly, detectable actions, and open-source information that can be
            interpreted or pieced together by an adversary to derive critical information. The five basic characteristics of
            OPSEC indicators that make them potentially valuable to an adversary include:
462                                                                                    1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
            19.6.5.1. Signatures—the characteristic of an indicator that makes it identifiable or causes it to stand out.
            19.6.5.2. Associations—the relationship of an indicator to other information or activities.
            19.6.5.3. Profiles—each functional activity generates its own set of more-or-less unique signatures and
            associations. The sum of these signatures and associations is the activity‘s profile.
            19.6.5.4. Contrasts—any differences observed between an activity‘s standard profile and its most recent or
            current actions.
            19.6.5.5. Exposure—refers to when and for how long an indicator is observed.
19.7. Information Security (INFOSEC).
      Air Force policy is to identify, classify, downgrade, declassify, mark, protect, and destroy its classified information
      consistent with national policy. Controlled unclassified information (CUI) will also be protected per national policy.
      DoDM 5200.01, Volumes 1 through 4, DoD Information Security Program, and AFI 31-401, Information Security
      Program Management, provide the guidance for managing classified information and CUI.
      19.7.1. Classification.
            19.7.1.1. Original Classification. Original classification is the initial decision by an original classification
            authority (OCA) that an item of information meets the requirements for classification as specified in Executive
            Order 13526, Classified National Security Information, and that unauthorized disclosure of the information
            reasonably could be expected to result in damage to the national security. Information will be classified at the
            Top Secret, Secret, or Confidential level depending upon the severity of damage that could occur. Only the
            Secretary of Defense, the secretaries of the military departments, and other officials who are specifically
            delegated this authority in writing may originally classify information. Within the Air Force, OCAs are
            appointed at the Top Secret-and-below levels by the Secretary of the Air Force and at the Secret-and-below
            levels by the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary. OCAs receive training in the exercise of this authority
            and have program responsibility or cognizance over the information.
            19.7.1.1.1. Security Classification Guide (SCG). An SCG documents the details of an original classification
            decision. It specifies items or categories of information for each system, program, plan, or project that must be
            classified. The SCG identifies for each item or category of information the applicable classification level, such
            as Secret; the reason for classification; any special-handling caveats; the downgrading and declassification
            instructions, declassification instructions and exemptions, the OCA, and a point of contact.
            19.7.1.2. Derivative Classification. Information is derivatively classified when it is extracted, paraphrased,
            restated, or generated in a new form. Source documents and/or SCGs provide classification guidance. Simply
            photocopying or otherwise mechanically reproducing classified material is not derivative classification. Within
            DoD, all cleared personnel who create and derivatively classify material are personally responsible for ensuring
            the derivative classification markings are completed according to DoDM 5200.01 and AFI 31-401.
            19.7.1.3. Markings. All classified information, whether hard copy or electronic, must be properly marked.
            Classification markings must be conspicuous as they are the principle means of informing holders of about
            specific protection requirements for the material. Markings are used to:
            19.7.1.3.1. Alert holders to the presence of classified information.
            19.7.1.3.2. Identify, as specifically as possible, the exact information needing protection.
            19.7.1.3.3. Indicate the level of classification assigned to the information.
            19.7.1.3.4. Provide guidance on downgrading (if any) and declassification.
            19.7.1.3.5. Give information on the sources of and reasons for classification.
            19.7.1.3.6. Warn holders of special access, control, or safeguarding requirements.
            19.7.1.4. Specific Markings on Documents. Every classified document must be marked to show the highest
            classification of information it contains. The marking must be conspicuous enough to alert anyone handling the
            document that it is classified. The overall classification will be identified on the front cover, if there is one; the
            title page, if there is one; the first page; and the outside of the back cover, if there is one. Additionally:
            19.7.1.4.1. Every classified document must show the agency, office of origin, and date of origin on the first
            page, title page, or front cover.
AFPAM36-2241     1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                         463

          19.7.1.4.2. Every originally classified document must have a ―Classified by‖ line placed on the first page, title
          page, or front cover that identifies the original classification authority responsible for classifying the
          information it contains. Derivatively classified documents are marked ―Derived from‖ and the document and
          date the information was derived from or the words ―Multiple Sources‖ if the information was derived from
          more than one source. If there are multiple sources, they must all be identified on a list and attached to the
          document.
          19.7.1.5. Declassification. Information must be declassified as soon as it no longer meets the standards for
          classification. In some exceptional cases, the need to protect information still meeting the standard may be
          outweighed by the public interest in disclosure of the information. In these cases, the information should be
          declassified. Four separate and parallel systems can bring about the declassification of information. These are
          systems that:
          19.7.1.5.1. Require the original classifier to decide at the time information is classified when it can be
          declassified.
          19.7.1.5.2. Cause information of permanent historical value to be automatically declassified on the 25th
          anniversary of its classification unless specific action is taken to keep it classified.
          19.7.1.5.3. Cause information to be reviewed for possible declassification upon request.
          19.7.1.5.4. Involve a process for systematic review of information for possible declassification.
          19.7.1.6. Challenges. If substantial reason exists to indicate the document has been classified improperly or
          unnecessarily, personnel should submit challenges of classification to the security manager or the classifier of
          the information.
    19.7.2. Safeguarding:
          19.7.2.1. General Policy. Everyone granted access to classified information is responsible for protecting the
          information and material in their possession or control. Classified information must be protected at all times
          either by storing it in an approved security container or facility or having it under the personal observation and
          control of an authorized individual. Everyone who works with classified information is personally responsible
          for taking proper precautions to ensure unauthorized persons do not gain access to it.
          19.7.2.2. Care During Working Hours. Classified material removed from storage must be kept under constant
          surveillance of authorized persons. Classified document cover sheets are placed on classified documents when
          not in secure storage. Items containing classified information must either be destroyed immediately after they
          have served their purpose or protected as required for the level of classified information they contain.
          19.7.2.3. End-of-Day Security Checks. Heads of activities that process or store classified information must
          establish a system of security checks at the close of each working day to ensure the area is secure. Use Standard
          Form (SF) 701, Activity Security Checklist, to record the checks. An integral part of the security check system is
          to secure all vaults, rooms, and security containers used to store classified material. SF 702, Security Container
          Check Sheet, is used to record such actions. In addition, SF 701 and SF 702 are annotated to reflect after-hours,
          weekend, and holiday activity.
          19.7.2.4. Control Access. A person may not have access to classified information unless determined to have the
          proper security clearance, need to know, and a signed nondisclosure agreement. The final responsibility for
          determining if a person‘s official duties require access to any element or item of classified information and if
          the person is granted the appropriate security clearance rests with the individual authorized possession,
          knowledge, or control of the information, not the prospective recipient. These rules also apply when
          safeguarding classified information:
          19.7.2.4.1. Top secret information is controlled and accounted for through Top Secret control account systems.
          Unit commanders and staff agency chiefs who routinely originate, store, receive, or dispatch top secret material
          establish these accounts and designate a Top Secret control officer (TSCO) to maintain them. All transactions
          for top secret material must be conducted through the TSCO.
          19.7.2.4.2. Secret information is controlled internally according to Air Force policy and as determined by unit
          commanders or staff agency chiefs. Receipts are necessary when transmitting the material through the United
          States Postal Service, or approved package delivery services, and also when an employee has been designated
          as a courier for hand-carrying information.
464                                                                                    1 OCTOBER 2013           AFPAM36-2241
             19.7.2.4.3. Confidential information is controlled through routine administrative procedures. Individuals need
             not use a receipt for confidential material unless asked to do so by the sending activity.
             19.7.2.5. Security Incidents. Anyone finding classified material out of proper control must take custody of and
             safeguard the material, if possible, and immediately notify the appropriate security authorities. Any person who
             becomes aware of the possible compromise of classified information must immediately report it to the head of
             his or her local activity or to the activity security manager. If classified information appears in the public media,
             DoD personnel must be careful not to make any statement or comment that would confirm the accuracy or
             verify the classified status of the information. Personnel must report the matter but must not discuss it with
             anyone without an appropriate security clearance and need to know.
      19.7.3. Sanctions.
             DoD military and civilian personnel are subject to sanctions if they knowingly, willfully, or negligently disclose
             classified information to unauthorized persons. Sanctions include, but are not limited to, warning, reprimand,
             suspension without pay, forfeiture of pay, removal, discharge, loss or denial of access to classified information,
             and removal of classification authority. Action may also be taken under the Uniform Code of Military Justice
             for violations of the code and under applicable criminal law.
19.8. Personnel Security:
      19.8.1. The Personnel Security Program involves determining the reliability, trustworthiness, good conduct and
      character of individuals before they are assigned sensitive duties or have access to classified information. Personnel
      must continue to be trustworthy by complying with Personnel Security Program requirements throughout their careers.
      Commanders and supervisors must continually observe and evaluate their subordinates with respect to these criteria
      and immediately report any unfavorable conduct or conditions that come to their attention that might bear on the
      subordinates‘ trustworthiness and eligibility to occupy a sensitive position or have eligibility to classified information.
      19.8.2. The Commander will report all unfavorable information to the Air Force Central Adjudication Facility
      (AFCAF). The AFCAF grants, denies, and revokes security clearance eligibility. If the security clearance eligibility is
      denied or revoked, individuals are granted due process and may appeal the decision.
      19.8.3. Personnel security clearances are recorded in the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS). Unit security
      managers have access to JPAS to determine if an individual in the organization has been granted a security clearance
      according to AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management.
19.9. Industrial Security:
      19.9.1. Policy.
             Air Force policy is to identify in its classified contracts specific government information and sensitive resources
             that must be protected against compromise or loss while entrusted to industry. AFI 31-601, Industrial Security
             Program Management, assigns functional responsibilities and establishes a system of review that identifies
             outdated, inappropriate, and unnecessary contractual security requirements. Policy also outlines and provides
             guidance for establishing on-base integrated contractor visitor groups.
      19.9.2. Scope.
             The security policies, requirements, and procedures identified in AFI 31-601 are applicable to Air Force
             personnel and on-base DoD contractors performing services under the terms of a properly executed contract and
             associated security agreement or similar document, as determined appropriate by the installation commander.
19.10. Integrated Defense (ID) Program:
      19.10.1. The Air Force Integrated Defense (ID) Program is the integration of multidisciplinary active and passive,
      offensive and defensive capabilities, employed to mitigate potential risks and defeat adversary threats to Air Force
      operations within the base boundary (BB) and the base security zone (BSZ). These threats include, but are not limited
      to, terrorist, insiders, criminals, and foreign intelligence and security services (FISS). It is critical to integrate ID
      efforts with other Air Force capabilities to achieve synergistic effects using an all-hazards approach. Potential hazards
      to an installation include, but are not limited to, chemical biological radiological nuclear-high yield explosive
      (CBRNE) attacks, natural and man-made disasters, major accidents, and accidental or deliberate release of hazardous
      materials, toxic industrial materials or chemicals (see AFPD 31-1, Integrated Defense). Integrated Defense is a
      fundamental battle competency for all Airmen, whether garrison or deployed. The teaming of ID forces creates a
      united, seamless defense stronger than the defensive efforts of individuals/or individual units. This effort ensures all
      Airmen are trained to defend themselves and integrate into defense operations while in garrison or deployed.
      Installation commanders determine the effects required of ID operations at Air Force installations based on a four-step
AFPAM36-2241      1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                           465

    process that involves:
          19.10.1.1. Determining and prioritizing the criticality of installation assets.
          19.10.1.2. Analyzing the threats and operating environment.
          19.10.1.3. Assessing the installation‘s vulnerabilities to the threats.
          19.10.1.4. Making prudent integrated defense decisions based on the risk estimate. The integrated defense risk
          management process (IDRMP) is critical in order for the installation commander to make the best use of limited
          resources and personnel available to execute the ID mission.
    19.10.2. Integrated defense is an ―all-Airmen‖ program. However, Air Force Security Forces have enterprise lead in
    ID operations. The defense force commander (DFC) synchronizes integrated defense operations with emergency and
    consequence management activities articulated in applicable Air Force and DoD publications.
    19.10.3. The goal of ID is to neutralize security threats throughout the BB in order to ensure unhindered Air Force
    operations. Through ID, commanders must: minimize mission degradation from threat activity within the BB and
    coordinate necessary security operations support within the BSZ when the BSZ is not congruent with the BB;
    minimize loss of life and injury from threat activity; and protect government property and personnel from hostile and
    criminal acts.
    19.10.4. ID does not stand alone to protect personnel and resources; planners create an effective security program by
    coordinating with other DoD and Air Force programs. Furthermore, the protection and defense of air bases requires
    the coordinated effort of emergency management (EM), antiterrorism (AT), and other mission support function forces
    under the force protection (FP) umbrella. This coordinated planning provides a seamless progression of protection
    programs and completes the installation‘s defense in depth picture.
    19.10.5. Joint Publications define the BB as a line that delineates the surface area of a base for the purpose of
    facilitating coordination and deconfliction of operations between adjacent units, formations, or areas. See Figure 19.1
    for an example of a BB configuration. Therefore, the BB is not necessarily the base perimeter. Rather, it should be
    established based upon the factors of mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops and support available, time
    available, civil considerations (METT-TC), specifically balancing the need of the base defense forces to control key
    terrain with their ability to accomplish the mission. These measures decrease the likelihood of fratricide, prevent non-
    combatant casualties, and minimize damage to the property of friendly civilians. Boundaries may not necessarily
    coincide with the fenced perimeter, property lines or legal boundaries. Nevertheless, while tactical considerations will
    ideally determine ID boundaries, the DFC will strictly adhere to legal, jurisdictional, host nation constraints,
    commander‘s intent, and higher echelon orders and directives when conducting operations within the BB.
    19.10.6. The base security zone is an Air Force unique concept and term to be used intraservice only. The Air Force
    uses the planning term base security zone to describe the area of concern around an air base and to support the
    establishment and adjustment of the BB. The BSZ is the area outside the base perimeter from which the base may be
    vulnerable from standoff threats (for example, mortars, rockets, man portable aerial defense systems [MANPADS]).
    The installation commander should identify the BSZ and coordinate via the operational chain of command with local,
    state, federal agencies (within the continental United States [CONUS]) or host nation or area commander (outside the
    continental United States [OCONUS]) for the BSZ to be identified as the BB. If the BB does not include all of the
    BSZ terrain, the installation commander is still responsible for either mitigating (through coordination with local, state,
    federal agencies (CONUS) or the area commander or host nation (OCONUS) or accepting the risks of enemy attack
    from the terrain outside the BB. The BSZ, in its simplest terms, is the area from which a threat can launch an attack
    against base personnel and resources or aircraft approaching/departing the base. Air-minded forces must consider the
    BSZ for planning constructs CONUS, OCONUS, and at contingency locations. Threats vary in the ID continuum from
    peacetime to wartime, regardless of the location of our installations.
          19.10.6.1. Optimally, the BSZ and the BB are the same, but that is not always the case. The BSZ may, for
          planning purposes, incorporate more geographical area than the BB. For example, there may be key terrain
          outside the BB from which adversaries can impact air operations.
466                                                                                1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
       Figure 19.1. Base Boundary Configuration Example.




            19.10.6.2. For terrain outside the BB, but within the BSZ, the DFC should coordinate with local, state, federal
            agencies (CONUS) or host nation or area commander (OCONUS) to conduct base defense tasks within the area.
            If these forces/agencies are not available due to competing requirements, then the DFC should coordinate via
            their operational chain of command with the appropriate area commander to conduct the base defense task.
            When defense forces operate outside the BB, the appropriate area of operations (AO) commander should
            exercise tactical control (TACON) over those forces for base defense purposes only. Joint and coalition forces
            entering the BB should inform the base defense operations center (BDOC) before they enter, and monitor the
            BDOC‘s communication net while operating in the area.
            19.10.6.3. The BDOC is the command and control center for ID operations during routine and emergency
            operations. The DFC will establish a BDOC to coordinate and direct, via their operational chain of command,
            the TACON of ID forces and supporting capabilities. All functions performed by central security control, the
            law enforcement desk, or other security forces control centers will be performed by the BDOC at all locations,
            home station and deployed.
19.11. Integrated Defense Effects:
      19.11.1. Commanders execute ID with the objective of achieving nine desired effects based on the risk management
      process described in paragraph 19.12. Those effects are:
            19.11.1.1. Anticipate—achieved through intelligence analysis.
            19.11.1.2. Deter—achieved through the professional and persistent execution of security tactics, techniques,
            and procedures (TTP).
            19.11.1.3. Detect—achieved through a variety of screening processes and observation technologies.
            19.11.1.4. Assess—achieved through cognizance, readiness, and awareness of all Air Force personnel and an
            understanding of threat TTPs.
            19.11.1.5. Warn—achieved through standardized and reliable communications among and between units and
            personnel.
            19.11.1.6. Defeat—achieved through a multitude of force applications relevant to the threat.
            19.11.1.7. Delay—achieved through deliberate layers of defensive applications designed to progressively
            weaken or hinder the enemy‘s efforts.
            19.11.1.8. Defend—achieved through the coordinated and synchronized force application of all Airmen in a
            unified effort against the enemy.
            19.11.1.9. Recover—achieved through prudent logistics and consequence management planning.
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                           467

     19.11.2. These effects are not randomly applied to any installation; instead they are deliberately achieved through
     innovative and reliable TTPs based on the ID risk management process and analysis.
     19.11.3. The intelligence fusion cell (IFC) is an action group whereby the security forces staff S-2 (intelligence)
     function coordinates with subject matter experts (SME) from the Intelligence and AFOSI communities to collaborate
     and conduct intelligence preparation of the operational environment (IPOE); the goal being to leverage information
     and intelligence to support the timely identification of indicators and warnings of emerging localized threats. The IFC
     and its products are the primary information sources that directly support the DFC in making immediate, proactive
     decisions for ID planning.
     19.11.4. Ideally, defense forces receive such good intelligence they are able to anticipate any and all threats. As this is
     unlikely, attaining subsequent ID desired effects is necessary. For instance, it would be preferred to deter a threat; but
     if that does not succeed, the next ideal effect would be to detect the threat. Once the threat is detected, assessment by
     forces occurs. Friendly forces are then warned of the threat and attempts are made to defeat, or eliminate, the threat. If
     the threat cannot be defeated, it must be delayed. If not possible, defensive measures must be taken to mitigate the
     effects of the threat. Recovery actions are then implemented to consolidate and reorganize friendly forces and restore
     operations.
     19.11.5. IPOE is an analytical methodology that provides predictive intelligence to warfighters for use in planning and
     executing operations. A systematic, four-step process, IPOE‘s bottom line intent is to support operational decisions by
     providing analyzed information regarding the threat and environment in a given set of circumstances. IPOE is the
     primary mechanism used to achieve the ID desired effect of ―anticipate.‖ It is a continuous process, enabling the
     commander to visualize: the spectrum of friendly and adversarial capabilities and weakness; how they are affected by
     a variety of environmental factors (for example, weather, light, terrain, political and social conditions); and the logical
     predictions of the most likely and most dangerous enemy course of action (ECOA).
     19.11.6. IPOE is a continuous, four-part process that: (1) defines the operating environment; (2) describes the
     operating environment‘s effects; (3) evaluates the enemy; and (4) determines ECOA. The examples below should be
     collected, analyzed, and applied to the tactical situation, as a minimum.
           19.11.6.1. Part 1. This part is comprised of comprehensive lists, dispositions, and capabilities (offensive and
           defensive) of tasked friendly forces and other forces (for example, host nation military and police forces, local,
           state, national agencies [CONUS] and host nation [OCONUS]) that contribute to the security of the installation
           and are available to contribute during enemy surges (for example, increased force protection conditions
           [FPCON]); terrain and weather (including light data); and background data on the operating environment to
           include history, demographics, socioeconomic data, religious groups, etc. Incident and emergency response
           plans should also be identified in Part 1 for later consideration during war-gaming conducted during IPOE Part
           4.
           19.11.6.2. Part 2. Analyze the data collected in Part 1 and describe how the factors affect operations,
           equipment, and personnel. Whenever possible, use color-coded stoplight charts that use green, yellow, and red
           coding to describe aspects of operations or effects on personnel and equipment. For example, use mission
           capable (green), partially mission capable (yellow), or non-mission capable (red).
           19.11.6.3. Part 3. Collect historical data and existing intelligence analyses (for example, Defense Intelligence
           Agency country reports or AFOSI defense threat assessments (DTA) of the operating environment, or other
           reports about adversaries capable of operating in the geographic area of concern. Consider the capabilities and
           weaknesses of each specific group without assuming that all enemy forces collaborate. Consider and analyze the
           effects of the operating environment (gathered in Part 1 and analyzed in Part 2) on each individual adversary.
           19.11.6.4. Part 4. Consider all data collected in the previous three parts and make logical predictions of
           ECOAs. For each adversary assessed to be present and capable, establish a prediction of the most likely and
           most dangerous ECOAs. Then, through a process of war-gaming, establish friendly courses of action (COA)
           that would effectively meet the commander‘s intent in defeating the predicted ECOAs.
19.12. Integrated Defense Risk Management Process (IDRMP).
     The IDRMP provides installation commanders, integrated defense working groups (IDWG), DFCs and defense
     planners the ability to produce effects-based, integrated defense plans (IDP) by using a standardized model to identify
     risks and develop risk management strategies. These strategies leverage finite resources against adaptive threats to
     protect Air Force resources and personnel. The IDRMP identifies at risk assets and aids the IDWG in generating the
     criticality assessment and the risk assessment products. A risk reduction decision based on a clear understanding of
     what is important, the estimated threat, and how the asset might be damaged/destroyed, is then developed through a
468                                                                                    1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
      logical process involving asset criticality assessment, threat assessment, and vulnerability assessment. The IDRMP
      analyzes an installation‘s defense capabilities and provides options to mitigate security risks, such as additional TTPs,
      facility hardening, technology insertion, etc.
      19.12.1. The IDRMP has four main components: the risk assessment (as described above); the risk tolerance decision;
      COA determination; and decision and implementation. All four components are directly influenced by the evolving
      situation monitored through the IPOE cycle. As such, new information, assessments, or decisions can be assimilated
      into the IDRMP at any point, which may alter the execution of ID. These four components are performed in the
      following seven steps:
            19.12.1.1. Step 1: Develop the Criticality Assessment (CA). The CA identifies assets worthy of protection
            whose loss or damage would have a negative impact on the mission. Fundamental to this evaluation is the
            criteria used to measure asset value or consequence of loss. Typical criteria include mission criticality, impact
            on national defense, replaceability, monetary value, and relative (or intrinsic) value.
            19.12.1.2. Step 2 and Step 3: Develop the Threat Assessment (TA) and Vulnerability Assessment (VA).
            Threat multiplied by vulnerability determines the probability of loss (or damage) of the asset. Threats are
            generally considered in terms of adversaries and their tactics (for example, hackers, terrorists, criminals,
            protestors). To know if adversaries pose a threat requires information about their operational capability,
            intentions, activity, operating environment, and history. Vulnerabilities are weaknesses that can be exploited by
            an adversary because of inadequate security, lax or complacent personnel trends, vulnerable software or
            hardware, and insufficient security policies or procedures. Note: Identification and evaluation of existing threats
            and vulnerabilities are identified during Parts 1 through 3 of the IPOE process and may be supplemented with
            other documents, such as antiterrorism (AT) vulnerability assessments.
            19.12.1.3. Step 4: Develop the Risk Assessment (RA). Once all previous assessments (criticality, threat, and
            vulnerability) are completed and studied together to provide a complete picture of the risks to an asset, the RA
            can be developed. A quantitative measurement of risk can be determined using the following equation: risk =
            asset criticality multiplied by (threat multiplied by vulnerability).
            19.12.1.4. Step 5: Risk Tolerance Decision. At this point in the IDRMP, the commander may have enough
            data to enable an informed risk tolerance decision. But if information required to assess risks is deficient, a
            command critical intelligence requirement should be developed or modified to guide the intelligence
            community‘s collection efforts. In today‘s resource-constrained environment, some risks must be accepted.
            However, some risks cannot be tolerated due to their frequency or severity of consequence. The installation
            commander‘s intent for ID will define the level of tolerance. For risks exceeding the commander‘s tolerance
            level, countermeasures will be developed in the next step to render these risks more acceptable.
            19.12.1.5. Step 6: Present Countermeasure COAs. This step presents and evaluates options for reducing
            risks. While risks can be alleviated by reducing the asset‘s criticality or mitigating the threat, eliminating
            vulnerabilities is the area that can have the most impact on the installation commander‘s risk tolerance decision.
            At this time, the IDWG can develop various countermeasure COAs to remove or mitigate vulnerabilities and
            reduce unacceptable risks. An estimate of risk reduction (i.e., benefit of risk reduction) can be prepared, along
            with showing the costs associated with COA implementation.
            19.12.1.6. Step 7: Decision and Implementation. This is the most important step in the IDRMP. During this
            step, the installation commander selects the COAs that will bring the risks within his/her tolerance level, and
            directs resources to implement the decision. Closely tied with step 7 is continuous assessment. This feedback
            loop posits that risk management is not an event or tangible product, but rather a continuous cycle. The
            implementation of countermeasure COAs will sometimes change the installation‘s risk posture in unexpected or
            unintended ways. By immediately identifying changes to the installation‘s critical assets, threats and
            vulnerabilities, decision makers can continually refine the installation‘s risk posture.
      19.12.2. ID provides flexible planning and execution opportunities that allow owners/users of protection level 1 (PL1)
      non-nuclear, protection level 2 (PL2), protection level 3 (PL3), and protection level 4 (PL4) assets to become actively
      involved in the defense of their areas.
      19.12.3. The IDRMP provides a more precise understanding of how the three risk factors of threat, vulnerability and
      asset criticality relate to each other at each installation. Understanding the relationships between these factors, as well
      as continually analyzing the operating environment, assists commanders in mitigating, accepting, and reducing risks to
      appropriate levels.
AFPAM36-2241       1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                             469

      19.12.4. Operationalize force protection intelligence (FPI) in order to maintain optimal situational awareness
      throughout the BB and BSZ. This can be accomplished for DFC through the development of a robust
      intelligence/information collaboration, analysis, and fusion capability.
19.13. Security Protection Levels:
      19.13.1. Protection Level 1 (PL1).
            PL1 is assigned to those resources for which the loss, theft, destruction, misuse, or compromise would result in
            great harm to the strategic capability of the United States. Examples of PL1 resources are nuclear weapons in
            storage, mated to a delivery system, or in transit; designated command, control, and communications (C3)
            facilities; and aircraft designated to transport the President of the United States. PL1 security must result in the
            greatest possible deterrence against hostile acts. This level of security will provide maximum means to achieve
            detection, interception, and defeat of a hostile force before it is able to seize, damage, or destroy resources.
      19.13.2. Protection Level 2 (PL2).
            PL2 is assigned to resources for which the loss, theft, destruction, misuse, or compromise would cause
            significant harm to the war-fighting capability of the United States. Examples of PL2 resources are nonnuclear
            alert forces; designated space and launch systems; expensive, few in number, or one-of-a-kind systems or
            facilities; and intelligence-gathering systems. PL2 security must result in significant deterrence against hostile
            acts. This level of security will ensure a significant probability of detecting, intercepting, and defeating a hostile
            force before it is able to seize, damage, or destroy resources.
      19.13.3. Protection Level 3 (PL3).
            PL3 is assigned to resources for which the loss, theft, destruction, misuse, or compromise would damage United
            States war-fighting capability. Examples of PL3 resources are non-alert resources that can be generated to alert
            status, such as F-16 fighters; selected C3 facilities, systems, and equipment; and non-launch-critical or non-
            unique space launch systems. PL3 security must result in a reasonable degree of deterrence against hostile acts.
            This level of security ensures the capability to impede a hostile force and limit damage to resources.
      19.13.4. Protection Level 4 (PL4).
            PL4 is assigned to resources that do not meet the definitions of PL1, PL2, or PL3 resources, but for which the
            loss, theft, destruction, misuse, or compromise would adversely affect the operational capability of the Air
            Force. Examples of PL4 resources are facilities storing Category I, II, or III sensitive conventional arms,
            ammunition, and explosives; fuels and liquid oxygen storage areas; and Air Force accounting and finance vault
            areas. PL4 resources are secured by containing them in controlled areas. Unit commanders are responsible to
            provide physical protection for PL4 resources. Security forces conduct preventive patrols in areas and provide
            armed response.

Section 19D—Antiterrorism (AT) Program
19.14. Air Force Antiterrorism Program Defined.
      The program seeks to deter or limit the effects of terrorist acts against the Air Force by giving guidance on collecting
      and disseminating timely threat information, providing training to all Air Force members, developing comprehensive
      plans to deter and counter terrorist incidents, allocating funds and personnel, and implementing AT measures.
19.15. Antiterrorism Training and Exercises.
      At least annually, commanders conduct comprehensive field and staff training to exercise AT plans, to include AT
      physical security measures and emergency management plans. AT training and exercises shall be afforded the same
      emphasis as combat task training and executed with the intent to identify shortfalls affecting the protection of
      personnel, assets and information against terrorist attack and subsequent AT consequence management efforts. AT an
      area of responsibility specific training, particularly pre-deployment training, must be supported by measurable
      standards and include credible deterrence and response, TTPs, and lessons learned. Additionally, the current baseline
      through FPCON Charlie measures shall be exercised annually at installations and self-supported separate facilities.
19.16. Threat Information Collection and Analysis:
      19.16.1. Commanders shall task the appropriate organizations under their command to gather, analyze, and
      disseminate terrorism threat information, as appropriate. To support the commander, the Services should continuously
      ensure forces are trained to maximize the use of information derived from law enforcement liaison, intelligence, and
      counterintelligence (CI) processes and procedures. This includes intelligence procedures for handling priority
470                                                                                    1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
      intelligence requests for in-transit units as well as implementation of procedures to conduct intelligence preparation of
      the battlefield and mission analysis.
      19.16.2. Identifying the potential terrorism threat to DoD personnel and assets is the first step in developing an
      effective AT program. Commanders at all levels who understand the threat can assess their ability to prevent, survive,
      and prepare to respond to an attack. A terrorism threat assessment requires the identification of a full range of known
      or estimated terrorist threat capabilities (including the use or threat of use of chemical, biological, radiological,
      nuclear, or high-yield explosives and weapons of mass destruction [WMD]). In addition to tasking appropriate
      agencies to collect information, commanders at all levels can and should encourage personnel under their command to
      report information on individuals, events, or situations that could pose a threat to the security of DoD personnel,
      families, facilities, and resources.
      19.16.3. At the strategic level, the Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (HQ
      USAF/A2) is responsible for ensuring the timely collection processing, analysis, production, and dissemination of
      foreign intelligence, current intelligence, and national-level intelligence information concerning terrorist activities,
      terrorist organizations, and force protection issues. These efforts will focus on, but not be limited to, transnational and
      state-sponsored entities and organizations. The Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) is the lead Air
      Force agency for collection, investigation, analysis, and response for threats arising from terrorists, criminal activity
      and foreign intelligence and security services. AFOSI is primarily focused on countering adversary intelligence
      collection activities against U.S. forces and will act as the Air Force single point of contact with federal, state, local
      and foreign nation law enforcement, counterintelligence, and security agencies.
19.17. Department of Defense Random Antiterrorism Measures (RAM) Program.
      Installation commanders shall develop and implement a RAM Program that will include all units on the installation.
      The intent of the RAM Program is to provide random, multiple security measures that consistently change the look of
      an installation‘s AT program. RAMs introduce uncertainty to an installation‘s overall force protection program to
      defeat surveillance attempts and make it difficult for a terrorist to accurately predict our actions. The RAM program
      shall be included in AT plans and tie directly with all FPCONs (including FPCON Normal) to ensure continuity and
      standardization should threats require Air Force-wide implementation. RAM times for implementation, location, and
      duration shall be regularly changed to avoid predictability. RAM execution shall be broad based and involve all units
      and personnel. Antiterrorism officers (ATO) are required to monitor, track, and analyze RAM implementation efforts.
      Installation commanders will develop procedures to ensure RAMs are being conducted and reported to the ATO.
19.18. General Antiterrorism Personal Protection.
      Always keep a low profile and avoid publicity. Avoid going out in large groups; be unpredictable. Vary daily routines
      to and from home and work. Be alert for anything suspicious or out of place. Avoid giving unnecessary personal
      details to anyone unless their identity can be verified. Be alert to strangers who are on government property for no
      apparent reason. Refuse to meet with strangers outside your workplace. Always advise associates or family members
      of your destination and anticipated time of arrival when leaving the office or home. Report unsolicited contacts to
      authorities and do not open doors to strangers. Memorize key telephone numbers. Be cautious about giving out
      information regarding family travel places or security measures. When overseas, learn and practice a few key phrases
      in the local language.
19.19. Home and Family Security.
      Your spouses and children should always practice basic precautions for their personal security. Familiarize your
      family with the local terrorist threat, and regularly review protective measures and techniques. Ensure everyone in the
      family knows what to do in any type of emergency. Restrict the possession of house keys. Lock all entrances at night,
      including the garage. Keep the house locked, even if you are at home. Destroy all envelopes or other items that show
      your name, rank, or other personal information. Remove names and rank from mailboxes. Watch for unfamiliar
      vehicles cruising or parked frequently in the area, particularly if one or more occupants remain in the vehicle for
      extended periods.
19.20. Telephone Security.
      Post emergency telephone numbers on the telephone and preprogram telephone numbers for security forces, local
      police, fire department, hospitals, and ambulances. Do not answer your telephone with your name and grade. Report
      all threatening phone calls to security officials and the telephone company. Attempt to ascertain any pertinent
      information about the caller. For example, background noise, accent, nationality, or location.
19.21. Travel Overseas.
      When traveling overseas, travel in small groups and try to be inconspicuous when using public transportation and
      facilities. Dress, conduct, and mannerisms should not attract attention and be generally similar to that worn by the
AFPAM36-2241        1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                             471

      people in the area. Avoid spontaneous gatherings or demonstrations; stay away from known trouble. Know emergency
      telephone numbers, local dialing instructions, and ensure family members carry a list of telephone numbers with them
      at all times.
19.22. Suspicious Packages or Mail.
      Look for an unusual or unknown place of origin; no return address; excessive amount of postage; abnormal size or
      shape; protruding strings; aluminum foil; wires; misspelled words; differing return address and postmark; handwritten
      labels; unusual odor; unusual or unbalanced weight; springiness in the top or bottom; inflexibility; crease marks;
      discoloration or oily stains; incorrect titles or title with no name; excessive security material; ticking, beeping, or other
      sounds; or special instruction markings, such as ―personal, rush, do not delay, or confidential‖ on any packages or mail
      received. Additionally, be vigilant for evidence of powder or other contaminants. Never cut tape, strings, or other
      wrappings on a suspect package. If the package has been moved, place it in a plastic bag to prevent any leakage of
      contents. If handling mail suspected of containing chemical or biological contaminants, wash hands thoroughly with
      soap and water. Report suspicious mail immediately and make a list of personnel who were in the room when the
      suspicious envelope or package was identified.
19.23. Transportation Security.
      Criminal and terrorist acts against individuals usually occur outside the home and after the victim‘s habits have been
      established. Your most predictable habit is the route you travel from home to your place of duty or to commonly
      frequented local facilities. Always check for tampering of the interior and exterior of your vehicle before entering it.
      Also check the tires and trunk for fingerprints or smudges. If you detect something out of the ordinary, do not touch it.
      Immediately contact the local authorities. When overseas, select a plain car. Avoid using government vehicles when
      possible. Do not display decals with military affiliations and do not openly display military equipment. Keep your
      doors locked at all times. Do not let someone you do not know direct you to a specific taxi. Ensure taxi is licensed and
      has safety equipment (seat belts at a minimum). Ensure face of driver and picture on license are the same. Travel with
      a companion.
19.24. Commercial Air Transportation Security Overseas.
      Before traveling overseas, consult the DoD Foreign Clearance Guide (DoD 4500.54-G, available at
      https://www.fcg.pentagon.mil) to ensure you know and can meet all requirements for travel to a particular country. Get
      an area of responsibility specific threat briefing from your security officer, ATO, or the appropriate counterintelligence
      or security organization prior to traveling overseas. This briefing is required prior to travel overseas and must occur
      within 3 months of travel. Use office symbols on orders or leave authorization if the word description denotes a
      sensitive position. Use military contractor U.S. flag carriers. Avoid traveling through high-risk areas. Do not use rank
      or military address on tickets. Try to sit in the center of the aircraft as a means of having the safest seat. Do not discuss
      military affiliation. Have proper identification to show airline and immigration officials. Do not carry classified
      documents unless absolutely mission essential. Dress conservatively; do not wear distinct military items (wear long-
      sleeved shirts if you have U.S.-affiliated tattoos). Carry plain civilian luggage; avoid military-looking bags, or bags
      with logos or decals.
19.25. Human Intelligence (HUMINT) and Counterintelligence (CI).
      HUMINT is a category of intelligence derived from information collected and provided by human sources. Human
      resources intelligence is also called HUMINT and is the intelligence derived from the intelligence collection discipline
      that uses human beings as both source and collectors, and where the human being is the primary collection instrument.
      Counterintelligence is information gathered and activities conducted to protect against espionage, other intelligence
      activities, sabotage, or assassinations conducted by or on behalf of foreign governments or elements thereof, foreign
      organizations or foreign persons, or international terrorist activities.
      19.25.1. Threat Areas:
            19.25.1.1. Espionage—the act of obtaining, delivering, transmitting, communicating, or receiving information
            about national defense with intent or reason to believe the information may be used to the injury of the United
            States or to the advantage of any foreign nation.
            19.25.1.2. Subversion–any action designed to undermine the military, economic, psychological, or political
            strength or morale of a regime.
            19.25.1.3. Sabotage—an act or acts with intent to injure, interfere with, or obstruct the national defense of a
            country by willfully injuring or destroying, or attempting to injure or destroy, any national defense or war
            material, premises, or utilities, to include human and natural resources.
472                                                                                 1 OCTOBER 2013         AFPAM36-2241
            19.25.1.4. Terrorism—the calculated use of unlawful violence or threat of unlawful violence to inculcate fear;
            intended to coerce or intimidate governments or societies in the pursuit of goals that are generally political,
            religious, or ideological.
      19.25.2. The HUMINT Effort:
            19.25.2.1. Interrogation. Interrogation is the systematic effort to procure information to answer specific
            collection requirements by direct and indirect questioning techniques of a person who is in the custody of the
            forces conducting the questioning. Proper questioning of enemy combatants, enemy prisoners of war, or other
            detainees by trained and certified DoD interrogators may result in information provided either willingly or
            unwittingly.
            19.25.2.2. Source Operations. Designated and fully trained military HUMINT collection personnel may
            develop information through the elicitation of sources, to include: ―walk-in‖ sources, who without solicitation
            make the first contact with HUMINT personnel; developed sources that are met over a period of time and
            provide information, based on operational requirements; unwitting persons, with access to sensitive
            information.
            19.25.2.3. Debriefing. Debriefing is the process of questioning cooperating human sources to satisfy
            intelligence requirements, consistent with applicable law. The source usually is not in custody and usually is
            willing to cooperate. Debriefing may be conducted at all echelons and in all operational environments. Through
            debriefing, face-to-face meetings, conversations, and elicitation, information may be obtained from a variety of
            human sources.
            19.25.2.4. Document and Media Exploitation. Captured documents and media, when properly processed and
            exploited, may provide valuable information such as adversary plans and intentions, force locations, equipment
            capabilities, and logistical status. The category of ―captured documents and media‖ includes all media capable
            of storing fixed information to include computer storage material. This operation is not a primary HUMINT
            function but may be conducted by any intelligence personnel with appropriate language support.
      19.25.3. Incident Reporting.
            AFI 71-101, Volume 4, Counterintelligence, requires individuals who have reportable contacts or acquire
            reportable information to immediately (within 30 days of the contact) report the contact or information, either
            verbally or in writing, to AFOSI. ―Contact‖ means any exchange of information directed to an individual,
            including solicited or unsolicited telephone calls, email, radio contact, and face-to-face meetings. Examples
            include:
            19.25.3.1. Contact for any reason other than for official duties with a foreign diplomatic establishment, whether
            in the United States or abroad.
            19.25.3.2. A request by anyone (regardless of nationality) for illegal or unauthorized access to classified or
            unclassified controlled information.
            19.25.3.3. Personal contact with an individual (regardless of nationality) who suggests that a foreign
            intelligence or any terrorist organization may have targeted him or her or others for possible intelligence
            exploitation.
            19.25.3.4. Information indicating military members, civilian employees, or DoD contractors have contemplated,
            attempted, or effected the deliberate compromise or unauthorized release of classified or unclassified controlled
            information.
      19.25.4. AFOSI Responsibility.
            The AFOSI initiates and conducts all CI investigations, operations, collections, and other related activities for
            the Air Force. In the United States, the AFOSI coordinates these activities when appropriate with the Federal
            Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Outside the United States, AFOSI coordinates these activities with the Central
            Intelligence Agency and the FBI, as appropriate. The AFOSI is also the installation-level training agency for CI
            awareness briefings and is the sole Air Force repository for the collection and retention of reportable
            information.
AFPAM36-2241         1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                           473

19.26. Protection of the President and Others:
      19.26.1. As a result of a formal agreement between the DoD and United States Secret Service, individuals affiliated
      with the Armed Services have a special obligation to report information to the Secret Service pertaining to the
      protection of the President of the United States. This obligation is specified in AFI 71-101, Volume 2, Protective
      Service Matters.
      19.26.2. Air Force members and civilian employees must notify their commanders, supervisors, or the AFOSI of
      information concerning the safety of anyone under the protection of the United States Secret Service. This includes the
      President and Vice President, the President- and Vice President-elect, all former Presidents and their wives or widows,
      or any foreign head of state visiting the United States. The type of information to report includes:
            19.26.2.1. Threats, incidents, or demonstrations against foreign diplomatic missions (embassies, chanceries,
            consulates) in the United States or its territories and the use or attempted use of bodily harm, assassination, or
            kidnapping as a political weapon.
            19.26.2.2. Civil disturbances which may require the use of federalized National Guard or U.S. military
            personnel to maintain or restore public order.
            19.26.2.3. U.S. citizens or residents who have renounced or indicated a desire to renounce the U.S. government
            and who are characterized by emotional instability, violent anti-U.S. sentiment, or a propensity toward violence.
            Others who should be reported are military members or civilian employees of the Armed Forces being separated
            or discharged or retired who are deemed a threat by a competent authority (installation or hospital commander).
      19.26.3. The AFOSI is the point of contact between the Air Force and the United States Secret Service. Any
      information of interest to the United States Secret Service that comes to the attention of Air Force commanders and
      supervisors must be reported to the nearest AFOSI unit as soon as possible.
19.27. Conclusion.
      Security responsibility applies to all members of the Air Force at all times. This chapter covered information
      assurance, installation security, and force protection. These topics are essential to the Air Force mission and to the
      security of all its resources. All Air Force members must be versed in security principles, apply it to all aspects of their
      work, and be conscious of how it affects their personal lives. Proper security measures directly contribute to Air Force
      readiness.

                                              STUDYING EFFECTIVELY
Section 20A—Overview
20.1. Introduction.
      Getting the most out of promotion studies is very much an individual affair. No method will produce the best results
      for every Airman. Lack of success may have more to do with poorly developed study skills than intellectual ability.
      This chapter suggests methods for effective studying, but each Airman must determine what methods and strategies
      work best for him or her. This chapter covers effective study habits, study strategies, the military knowledge and
      testing system, and a learning style self-assessment instrument to help Airmen prepare for promotion exams. This
      information is not testable for promotion.

Section 20B—Effective Study Habits in Eight Easy Steps
20.2. General Information.
      Airmen grapple with many issues that may make it difficult to concentrate on studying. To get promoted, you must
      study for your Promotion Fitness Exam (PFE) or USAF Supervisory Exam (USAFSE). The key to effective studying
      is to study smartly. You can begin with these effective study habits.
      20.2.1. Approach Studying with the Right Mindset:
            20.2.1.1. Many people consider studying a necessary task, rather than an enjoyable opportunity to learn, but
            research indicates that how you approach a task is almost as important as the task itself. Having the right
            mindset may help you study more effectively.
            20.2.1.2. Sometimes you can‘t force yourself to have the right mindset. During such times, you should take a
            study break. If you are distracted by other issues, studying will be an exercise in futility. Come back to it when
            you‘re not focused on something else.
            20.2.1.3. How to improve your study mindset:
            20.2.1.3.1. Decide to think positively while you study; remind yourself of your skills and abilities.
            20.2.1.3.2. Avoid catastrophic thinking. Instead of thinking, ―I‘ll never have enough time to study for this
            exam,‖ think ―It may be a little late to start studying, but if I do it now, I can still get most of it done.‖
            20.2.1.3.3. Avoid absolute thinking. Instead of thinking ―I always mess up,‖ the more objective view is, ―I
            didn‘t do very well last time. What can I do to improve?‖
            20.2.1.3.4. Avoid comparing yourself negatively with others.
      20.2.2. Bring Everything You Need; Nothing You Don’t:
            20.2.2.1. When you find an ideal place to study, you may bring things you don‘t need. For example, it may
            seem ideal to type notes into a computer to refer to later, but computers are a powerful distraction for many
            people. So ask yourself if you really need a computer to take notes, or can you make do with the old-fashioned
            paper and pencil.
            20.2.2.2. Don‘t forget the things you need to study for promotion (see the Enlisted Promotion Reference and
            Requirements catalog, https://www.omsq.af.mil/TE/EPRRC.pdf) to ensure you are studying the correct
            information. Don‘t waste time running back and forth to get an important book, paper, or other resource.
      20.2.3. Outline and Rewrite Your Notes.
            Many people find a standard outline format helps them boil information down to its most basic components, and
            connecting similar concepts makes information easier to remember during an exam. An outline is most effective
            as a learning tool when you use your own words and structure because everyone connects similar information
            differently. Failing to outline in your own style and words may result in failure to remember important items.
      20.2.4. Use Memory Games (Mnemonic Devices):
            20.2.4.1. Memory games, such as mnemonic devices, use simple word association to help remember pieces of
            information. Some people string together words to form an easy-to-remember nonsense sentence. The first letter
            of each word stands for a piece of the information you‘re trying to remember. A common military mnemonic
476                                                                                  1 OCTOBER 2013          AFPAM36-2241
            device example is ―Be My Little General of the Air Force.‖ The first letters of the words help you remember the
            general officer ranks: Brigadier, Major, Lieutenant, and General.
            20.2.4.2. The key to such memory devices is the new phrase or sentence you come up with has to be more
            memorable and easier to remember than the terms or information you‘re trying to learn. These don‘t work for
            everyone, so if mnemonics don‘t work for you, don‘t use them.
      20.2.5. Practice, Practice, Practice.
            The age-old adage ―practice makes perfect‖ is true. You can practice by yourself using practice exams or flash
            cards (depending on what‘s available). If a practice exam isn‘t available, you can make one yourself. However,
            interactive exercises available at http://pdg.af.edu/ may help you retain information from the PDG. Whatever
            tools you use, practice can enhance your retention of general military knowledge in the PDG.
      20.2.6. Make and Stick to a Schedule:
            20.2.6.1. Many people plan to study when they get around to it or have some spare time. If you schedule study
            time the same way your duty hours are scheduled, you‘ll find studying is less hassle in the long run. Instead of
            last-minute cramming sessions, scheduling the same amount of study time every day for 3 to 6 months before
            your promotion test will be easier and enable you to learn more of the material.
            20.2.6.2. Some people study every day, others once or twice a week. Frequency isn‘t as important as actually
            studying routinely. Even if you study one day a week for 6 to 8 months, that is better than a massive cram
            session a few days before the exam.
      20.2.7. Build in Breaks and Rewards:
            20.2.7.1. If you view studying as a chore, it will be natural to avoid it. If, however, you use rewards to help
            reinforce what you‘re doing, you may be pleasantly surprised by an attitude change.
            20.2.7.2. Start by breaking study time into manageable components. Studying for 4 hours at a time without a
            break is unrealistic for most people. Studying for an hour followed by a 5-minute break and a snack may be
            more sustainable and enjoyable for you. Divide study time into segments that make sense and work for you.
            20.2.7.3. When establishing your goals, establish rewards as well. Tell yourself specifically what your reward
            will be if you reach your goal: Maybe ―I will have a special dessert tonight if...,‖ or ―I will buy a new song
            online if...,‖ or ―I will spend an extra 30 minutes gaming if...‖ for reaching the established goal. The point is,
            find a reward that is small but real, and to stick to it. Setting limits on your behavior is a method to teach
            yourself discipline.
      20.2.8. Stay Healthy and Balanced:
            20.2.8.1. It may seem hard to live a balanced life, but the more balanced your life, the easier every component
            becomes. If you spend all of your time focused on one thing, your life may become unbalanced. When that
            happens, everything becomes more difficult.
            20.2.8.2. Maintaining a balanced life comes more easily over time, but you can work to improve health and
            balance by doing what you already know: exercise regularly, eat nutritious food, and get enough sleep. There
            are no shortcuts to good health.

Section 20C—Study Strategies
20.3. General Information.
      Whether you are studying for a promotion test, career development course (CDC) exam, or college test, the following
      study strategies may help you attain your goals:
      20.3.1. Stay Motivated.
               Studying and learning can take you far in life, yet it can seem so hard to get around to it, and life‘s constant
               distractions don‘t help.
               20.3.1.1. Attention. Distractions can affect your motivation to study. If you were totally isolated on a desert
               island, where there was absolutely nothing to do but study, you‘d study every word of your subject until you
               were completely versed in it because there would be nothing to distract you. Having so many choices
               means—now more than ever—we need to exert willpower.
AFPAM36-2241    1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                             477

            20.3.1.2. What Do You Want Out of Life? To stay motivated, you should think about why you are studying.
            Presumably, studying is connected to what you want out of life, so ask yourself what you will ultimately get
            out of those things you do to avoid studying. Your life will be what you make of it.
            20.3.1.3. Feed and Develop Your Mind. We live in a world surrounded by entertainment options. However,
            your mind needs the nutrition of study as well as the relaxation of entertainment. When you study well, you
            find it has its own subtle pleasures and satisfactions apart from the positive results it can bring into your life.
    20.3.2. Use Time Wisely.
            You might have all the time in the world, but if you don‘t use it wisely, it won‘t help you to meet your goals.
            Procrastination is a problem for many students. The following tips may help you deal with this issue:
            20.3.2.1. Clear Your Schedule. Recognize that your obligations are as important as other people‘s needs. Set
            limits to prevent or minimize interruptions. Give full concentration to your studies without feeling guilty for
            whatever you‘re not doing.
            20.3.2.2. Get Motivated. Create a distraction-free work area, and commit to staying there for until you meet
            the day‘s study goal. If you get sidetracked, remind yourself how studying will help you achieve your goals.
            20.3.2.3. Prioritize. Answers to these questions may help you establish a priority list: What must be done
            first? When is it due? What is worth more in terms of the score? What is worth more in terms of personal,
            educational or career goals?
            20.3.2.4. Use a Daily ―To Do‖ List. A ―to do‖ list can help you reach your goals by helping you prioritize
            your daily tasks. As you complete tasks, check them off your list.
            20.3.2.5. Break Your Study into Chunks. Estimate how much time you‘ll need to complete a task, and
            don‘t try to do it all at one time. Break it down so that it‘s achievable without being overwhelming.
            20.3.2.6. It Doesn’t Have to Be Perfect. Some people are so afraid they won‘t perform perfectly that they
            don‘t do anything at all. Make sure you understand your goals. Then evaluate how important your study is
            and what level of performance is acceptable to you. Then, just do it.
            20.3.2.7. When You Really Hate It, Do It First. Work on a task you really hate first, while you have more
            energy. Reward yourself when you complete those items on your daily list.
    20.3.3. Study Environment.
            Once you know when and for how long you will study, commit to a time and place that meets your needs.
            Make that decision based on whether the environment matches your learning style. See Section 20E of this
            chapter for information to help you understand your dominant learning style. When establishing a study
            environment, consider:
            20.3.3.1. Time of Day. If possible, schedule your most challenging courses and most intense study sessions
            when you are most alert. Determine if you feel more alert and productive during the morning, midday, or
            evening, and schedule accordingly.
            20.3.3.2. Posture and Mobility. Some people prefer to sit at a table or desk (formal posture); others learn
            more easily sitting comfortably on a sofa or lying on the floor (informal); others need to move around when
            they study. Some people can sit and study for long periods of time (high persistence), while others need
            frequent breaks (low persistence). Recognize your posture and mobility needs when you to plan.
            20.3.3.3. Sound. Not everyone needs to study in a perfectly quiet environment; if you like sound when you
            study, try to make it an environment where the kinds of sounds won‘t actually be distracters.
            20.3.3.4. Lighting. Reading ability can be affected by the amount and type of lighting in your study area, and
            contrast between text and paper color. Be aware that light does make a difference, and choose a study
            environment that best matches your learning preferences.
            20.3.3.5. Temperature. You may not be able to control the room temperature, but you should be aware of
            your temperature preferences and dress accordingly.

      20.3.4. Set Goals:
               20.3.4.1. Be a Lifelong Learner. Technological advances have occurred in exponential leaps over the past
               century, and the only certainty in life is change. Education is the key to preparing you for change. Your most
               valuable asset and skill is your ability to learn and apply knowledge gained through education.
               20.3.4.2. Setting Goals. Setting goals is a good way to accomplish a particularly difficult task, such as
               developing study skills. Setting SMART goals will have you studying like a pro in no time. SMART goals
               are:
               20.3.4.2.1. Specific. Once you identify what you want to work on, narrow that down to a single, specific
               thing. Working out one problem at a time may make it easier to reach your goal without spreading yourself
               too thin. ―I want to be a better reader‖ is broad, so a more specific goal would be ―I want to improve my
               reading speed.‖ Write your specific goal on a piece of paper.
               20.3.4.2.2. Measurable. You won‘t know if you met your goal if you cannot measure it in some way. For
               instance, instead of ―I want to improve my reading speed,‖ a measurable goal would be ―I want to improve
               my reading speed by 10 words per minute.‖
               20.3.4.2.3. Action. This is where you decide how to achieve your goal. Write this part as an explanatory
               activity. For example, your goal might now be ―I want to improve my reading speed by 10 words a minute. I
               will do this by skimming over words like ‗the‘ and ‗an‘.‖
               20.3.4.2.4. Realistic. Make sure your goals are achievable. ―I will improve my reading speed by memorizing
               every word in the dictionary‖ is unrealistic for most people. Everyone has limits (time, resources, ability,
               etc.). Do not ignore limits or you may set unrealistic goals.
               20.3.4.2.5. Timeline. Set a suspense date, and make sure it is both specific and realistic for you. ―I will meet
               this goal sometime over the summer‖ is vague. ―I will meet this goal by the first day of school next fall,‖ is
               specific and realistic. Your timeline may be days, months or years, but must be realistic for you and your
               lifestyle.

Section 20D—Military Knowledge and Testing System (MKTS)
20.4. General Information.
      The MKTS Survey is critical to the Air Force promotion system. The results of this survey are used to revise and
      update the professional development guide (PDG) and to help guide the development of enlisted promotion tests.
      Enlisted members should use the survey results as part of a study strategy.
      20.4.1. Every 2 years, staff sergeant (SSgt) through chief master sergeant (CMSgt) volunteers complete the survey
      electronically. Individuals are asked to rate each topic on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (extremely low need) to 5 (an
      extremely high need). The results affect PDG content, and identify areas important for each enlisted grade. Results are
      provided to the PDG managers and subject-matter experts tasked to write the next promotion test editions.
      20.4.2. Survey results are available at http://pdg.af.edu/MKTS.htm. The survey format identifies the needs emphasis
      of each subject area, from those that ranked with a higher needs emphasis to those with the lowest needs emphasis.
      Some line items may not match the PDG exactly, as the initial MKTS survey sent to the field was based on a draft
      proposal to revise the PDG.

Section 20E—Know Your Learning Style
20.5. Adult Learning Style Profile.
      Adapted from Learning Style Reference Form, developed by Dr. Ray Barsch; University of Northwestern Ohio Virtual
      College, Learning Styles Evaluation.
      20.5.1. The statements in Figure 20.1 are designed to help an individual determine his or her learning style (visual,
      auditory, or tactile/kinesthetic). No learning style is better than any other. However, each makes its own demands on
      the environment of the learner. Figure 20.2 provides scoring procedures for the statements.
      20.5.2. A score that reads Visual = 33, Auditory = 24, Tactile = 19, indicates that you are a visual learner, with an
      auditory learning backup, and some tactile learning. Such people learn best by seeing something. If vision is obscured,
      visual learners can still learn through listening and tactile modes, but the major and best mode of learning unavailable.

Figure 20.1. Learning Style Profile.
 Directions: Read each statement, and place a check mark in the appropriate box that best matches your feeling about that
 statement. Work quickly. Do not sit and ponder. There are no right or wrong answers. When finished, use paragraph 20.5.2
 through paragraph 20.5.4 for scoring instructions.

        20.5.3. A score that reads Auditory = 30, Visual = 27, Tactile = 20 indicates that you are an auditory learner with a
        visual backup and some tactile learning. Such people learn best by hearing or saying what needs to be learned.
        Auditory learners can learn by seeing the information, but their best retention occurs when they see the information
        and repeat it to themselves, or when they hear the material being read aloud. They may also learn very well using
        audio cassettes or compact disks (CD), with retention and depth of learning enhanced by visual and tactile input.
        20.5.4. A score that reads Tactile = 34, Visual = 27, Auditory = 27 indicates that you are a tactile learner, with
        auditory and visual backup learning modes. Such people learn best by doing. They may write material they see or hear,
        take notes during lectures but rarely need to look at them afterwards, or find it easier to recall information if they move
        around or have something in their hands.

20.6. Auditory Learners.
        Auditory learners use hearing to process information. When given a choice, strong auditory learners will sit where they
        can easily hear the speaker and where outside sounds will not interfere. Some auditory learners will sit to one side, on
        the side of their strongest ear. Many auditory learners find it easy to understand the words from songs on the radio and
        announcements on public address systems.
        20.6.1. Characteristics:
                   20.6.1.1. Prefer to hear information.
                   20.6.1.2. Have difficulty following written directions.
                   20.6.1.3. Have difficulty with reading and writing.
                   20.6.1.4. May not look a speaker in the eye; may turn their eyes away so they can focus on listening.
        20.6.2. Learning Tips:
                   20.6.2.1. Use audio cassettes or CDs for reading and lectures (when available).
                   20.6.2.2. Participate in discussions, ask questions, and repeat given information.
                   20.6.2.3. Summarize or paraphrase written material, and record the information.
                   20.6.2.4. Discuss the material with someone else.
AFPAM36-2241        1 OCTOBER 2013                                                                                          481

20.7. Visual Learners.
      Visual learners need to see the big picture. They may choose a seat where they can see the whole stage or the whole
      screen. They may choose the back seat in a room so everything is out in front, and they can see it all.

      20.7.1. Characteristics:
               20.7.1.1. Need to see it to learn it; must have a mental picture.
               20.7.1.2. Have artistic ability.
               20.7.1.3. Have difficulty with spoken directions.
               20.7.1.4. Overreact to sounds.
               20.7.1.5. Have trouble following lectures.
               20.7.1.6. May misinterpret words.
      20.7.2. Learning Tips:
               20.7.2.1. Use visuals (graphics, films, slides, illustrations, doodles, charts, notes, flashcards) to reinforce
               learning.
               20.7.2.2. Use multicolored highlighters to organize notes.
               20.7.2.3. Write directions down.
               20.7.2.4. Visualize words, phrases, sentences to be memorized.
               20.7.2.5. Write everything down; review often.
20.8. Tactile Learners.
      Tactile/kinesthetic learners need to touch and feel things. They want to feel or experience the lesson themselves.
      Given a choice, strong kinesthetic learners will be right in the middle of the action. They may take things apart to
      see how they work and put them back together, without directions.
      20.8.1. Characteristics:
               20.8.1.1. Prefer hands-on learning/training.
               20.8.1.2. Can put things together without directions.
               20.8.1.3. Have difficulty sitting still.
               20.8.1.4. Learn better when they can get involved.
               20.8.1.5. May be coordinated and have athletic ability.
      20.8.2. Learning Tips:
               20.8.2.1. Make a model, do lab work, role-play.
               20.8.2.2. Take frequent breaks.
               20.8.2.3. Copy letters and words to learn how to spell and remember facts.
               20.8.2.4. Use a computer.
               20.8.2.5. Write facts and figures repeatedly.
               20.8.2.6. Read and walk, talk and walk, repeat and walk.

20.9. Conclusion.
      Effective studying does not happen overnight. It requires time and patience. Effective studying habits are learned
      through trial and error, and people must develop strategies that work for them. Developing effective study habits and
      strategies, and knowing your learning style should improve your ability to achieve your goals.
