This instruction implements AFPD 25-2, Support Agreements, dated 01 November 2001, by detailing
support agreements procedures within the Air Force. DoDI 4000.19 governs Interservice and Intragovern-
mental Support. The financial management aspects of Air Force Support are covered in AFI 65-601. Sup-
port to civilian authorities is covered in AFI 10-802. Air Force and DoD Policy directs that support
agreements be developed between suppliers and receivers within the affected organizations to document
recurring day-to-day peacetime support in order to provide unit commanders with the capability to ensure
resources are expended wisely and to help eliminate unnecessary resource duplication. This instruction
does not cover international agreements or the administration of contracts. Ensure that all records created
as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 37-123,
Management of Records and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule
(RDS) located at https://webrims.amc.af.mil/.
Request you review the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://
webrims.amc.af.mil to ensure all records collected as a result of compliance with this publication are
correctly scheduled, the information as stated in the AF RDS is still current and valid to include form
numbers, office symbols, retention periods, etc. If discrepancies exist in the RDS, follow instructions in
AFI 37-138 and AFMAN 37-123 to update the schedule.

(ACC) AFI 25-201, 1 May 2005, is supplemented as follows. This supplement provides guidance and
procedures for Support Agreement Managers (SAM) at all levels of the command to negotiate, coordinate
and document recurring day-to-day peacetime support. It applies to all active Air Combat Command
(ACC) units. It does not apply to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and Air National Guard (ANG)
units and members. Send comments and suggested improvements on AF Form 847, Recommendation for
Changes of Publication, through channels to HQ ACC/A4X, 130 Douglas Street, Suite 210, Langley
AFB, VA 23665-2791. Ensure all official records (files, logs, tracking tools, coordination tracking sheets,
database input/output, completed forms, appointment letters, memoranda of agreement/understanding
(MOA/MOU), memos for record, e-mails, annual reviews, rosters, lists, catalogs [user-developed], docu-
mented changes to agreements and other documents) created as a result of processes prescribed herein are
maintained in accordance with (IAW) AFMAN 37-123 (to be AFMAN 33-363), Management of Records.
These records will be disposed of IAW the AF Records Disposition Schedule (RDS), located at https://
afrims.amc.af.mil. Contact supporting records managers as required for approval and/or expertise. If a
record is maintained outside the official files, its location will be indicated on the file plan and a disposi-
tion control label will be affixed to the record media, e.g. continuity binder, etc. (See Attachment 10
(Added) for records management support provided by ACC hosts and requested by ACC tenants.)

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This revision updates AFI 25-201 dated 1 December 1996, following the guidance of DoDI 4000.19,
dated 9 August 1995. It provides detailed guidance to the field to include clarification for support to DoD
contractors; maintaining continuity folders by Installation Support Agreement Managers (SAMs); rede-
fining requirements of triennial review, addition of Attachment 9, Support Agreement Reimbursement
Matrix; aligning reviews for agreements where support is 100 percent Base Operating Support (BOS)
contractor provided; removal of reference to the Support Agreement Management System (SAMS) data-
base program; and the deletion of chapters 6 and 7.
(ACC) This revision incorporates and/or supersedes all HQ interim guidance provided to ACC units for
Support Agreements; standardizes the ACC program by mandating: the use of Support Agreement Man-
agement System (SAMS) and a quarterly SAMS export; standard format of agreement folders, establish-
ment of an installation standard level of support catalog, annual reporting to the Approving Authority,
annual appointment letters, required entries in SAMS, and required statements on DD Forms 1144, Sup-
port Agreement. New requirements identified in this supplement should be complied with within 90 days
after the publication date of this supplement.

                                               Chapter 1

                     AGREEMENTS—PURPOSE, TYPE, AND AUTHORITY

1.1. Support Agreements Covered by DD Form 1144.
   1.1.1. Support agreements administered by the Air Force are normally documented on DD Form
   1144 fall into the following principal categories:
    Air Force to Air Force, known as Intraservice Agreements (to include Air Force Reserve Command
   (AFRC) and Air National Guard (ANG)).
   Air Force to other Service or DoD components, known as Interservice Agreements.
   Air Force to other non-DoD Federal activities, known as Intragovernmental Agreements.
   Air Force to other non-Federal activities, excluding private or commercial enterprises.
   1.1.2. To ensure the maintenance of a comprehensive logistics record, all significant recurring sup-
   port provided by the Air Force shall be recorded on DD Form 1144, whether reimbursable or
   non-reimbursable. Also, record all such support on DD Form 1144 when the Air Force is the receiver.
   1.1.3. Policy and procedures for Interservice, Intragovernmental and Air Force to non-Federal activi-
   ties are governed by the DoDI 4000.19. In addition, the DoDI 4000.19 provides general guidance for
   the administration of support agreements within the DoD community.
   1.1.4. Conflict with Other Guidance. Information in agreements will not supersede any other DoD or
   Air Force directive or instruction that has instructional details of functional area support. The agree-
   ment itself should not prescribe detailed procedures for performing any particular support function.
   Such guidance is usually in other DoD or Air Force directives, instructions, manuals, etc., which
   apply to the particular type of support being performed. See Attachment 6 for examples. If such
   information is not in the DoD or Air Force directive in enough detail for local use, a local-level oper-
   ational procedure/directive should be prepared and referenced in the agreement.

1.2. Memorandums of Agreement/Understanding (MOA/MOUs).
   1.2.1. Most MOAs and MOUs are used to define areas of broad agreement between two or more par-
   ties. MOAs are memorandums that define general areas of conditional agreement between two or
   more parties – the actions of the other party depend on what the other party does (e.g., one party
   agrees to provide support if the other party provides the materials). MOUs are memorandums that
   define general areas of understanding between two or more parties – explains what each party plans to
   do; however, what each party does is not dependent on the actions of the other party (e.g., does not
   require reimbursement or other support from receiver).
   1.2.2. MAJCOM/Numbered Air Force (NAF) Level MOA/MOUs. Most internal Air Force MOA/
   MOUs are broad agreements between or among MAJCOMs or NAFs to identify parameters for devel-
   oping support agreements between subordinate units. At the installation level, these MOA/MOUs are
   then used as a source document in addressing the provision of services, funding and reimbursement
   arrangements. However, the actual transfer of funds or other resources is effected by the relevant
   established functional procedure and not by MOA/MOUs alone.

    1.2.2. (ACC) Command to Command MOA/MOUs will be coordinated by ACC/A4XP to ensure
    proper format, procedures, and coordination.
    1.2.3. Functional Area MOA/MOUs. MOA/MOUs can be used between functional areas to
    docu-ment mutually agreed areas of responsibility, such as:
               • Statement of facts.
               • Intentions.
               • Procedures.
               • Policies for future actions.
    The functional Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) (e.g. Civil Engineers, Security Forces) will
    usually draft, sign and maintain these documents, which are procedural or technical in nature and will
    not initiate the obligation of funds or manpower for recurring support.
       1.2.3.1. (Added-ACC) The SAM is not responsible for developing, coordinating or maintaining
       functional area MOA/MOUs. They may provide general format guidance, if requested.
    1.2.4. (Added-ACC) Wing-Level MOA/MOUs. The Installation SAM maintains Wing-level MOA/
    MOUs since they often generate related Support Agreements. All Wing-level MOA/MOUs will
    include a review date of no more than 3 years in the administrative remarks of the MOA/MOU.

1.3. Major Range and Test Facility Bases.
    1.3.1. DoDD 3200.11, Major Range and Test Facility Base, covers certain specialized range docu-
    mentation. However, base support provided to range users should still be covered by a standard sup-
    port agreement.

1.4. Support That Does Not Fall Under DoDI 4000.19 or This Instruction.
    1.4.1. Support to DoD contractors. If base support is required beyond what is identified in a Request
    for Proposal (RFP) or contract, the offerer or contractor formally requests the specified base support
    be incorporated into the RFP or contract. The request is submitted to the Contracting Officer who
    issued the contract or RFP. If the Contracting Officer agrees to the request, then it is documented in a
    contract not a support agreement. MOAs, MOUs or Support Agreements will not be used to amend or
    change contracts.
    1.4.1. (ACC) Support to DoD Contractors. When the host command furnishes on-base contractor
    logistical support under a tenant-funded contract, the command that must accomplish the contract will
    reimburse or refund the host base using the same funds cited in the basic contract. Do not allow the
    funding command to make the reimbursement through the contractor. See AFI 65-601, Vol I, Budget
    Guidance and Procedures, para 7.8.9, for additional guidance.
       1.4.1.1. (Added-ACC) Where a particular function is contracted out (i.e., Materiel Management,
       Transportation), the SAM forwards requirements to the local contracting office, then the local
       contracting officer or Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE) sends requirements to the contractor for
       coordination.

  1.4.2. Agreements In Lieu of War or Contingency Plans. Support agreements are not a suitable means
  to document support for war, Operations Other Than War (OOTW) or exercise requirements, which
  should be documented in the appropriate plan (e.g. support/operational/ deployment plans).
  1.4.3. Does not apply to agreements covering grants, international agreements, commercial activities,
  or acquisitions under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).

                                              Chapter 3

                              SEEKING SUPPORT AND WAIVERS

3.1. Seeking Support.
   3.1.1. Circumstances which may cause commanders to seek support include:
      3.1.1.1. Additions to existing role or mission.
      3.1.1.2. Unplanned loss of an existing source of support (e.g. natural disaster).
      3.1.1.3. Similar or identical functions being duplicated by nearby DoD components or other fed-
      eral agencies.
      3.1.1.4. Improved economy or efficiency of operation.
      3.1.1.5. The closest Air Force installation to an Air Force GSU should provide base support,
      regardless of parent MAJCOM.
      3.1.1.6. Consolidation of functions.
      3.1.1.7. Base Realignment and Closure.
      3.1.1.8. AFELMs, which need Air Force-unique support, that non-Air Force suppliers cannot pro-
      vide (e.g. Military Personnel Flight Services, USAF unique uniform)

3.2. Development of Support Agreements.
   3.2.1. Air Force organizations will develop support agreements with receivers of that support. The
   following general rules apply:
   3.2.1. (ACC) Agreements between ACC units, including ACC Headquarters and GSUs, are not
   required unless requested by the Supplying and/or Receiving Commander.
      3.2.1.1. An agreement should normally cover only one receiver, but more than one receiver can
      be included if they are funded from the same source as long as the funding source, as identified in
      Block 11c, is the same.
      3.2.1.2. Separate agreements are required for each different supplier.
      3.2.1.3. If two organizations both supply and receive support to and from each other, then sepa-
      rate agreements should be developed.
      3.2.1.4. Air Force organizations should provide support to other Air Force or DoD organizations
      when requested, subject to the commander’s determination that the organization has the capability
      to do so without jeopardizing assigned missions.
      3.2.1.5. The support provided to receivers should be equivalent to the standard level of support
      defined and furnished by the supplier to its own mission, unless otherwise requested or agreed to
      by the receiver.
      3.2.1.6. The provision of small-scale recurring support may not always justify the administrative
      effort and expense of preparing a full support agreement. In such cases, the agreement approving
      authority may waive the need to prepare a formal agreement but SAMs should still retain a written
      record of details to ensure continuity for the arrangement.
16                                                           AFI25-201_ACCSUP_I 20 AUGUST 2007


        3.2.1.6. (ACC) Documentation should include the receiver’s organizational information (name,
        location, and command), POC, description of support being provided, and costs associated with
        the support. Both receiver and supplier approving authorities should sign document.
     3.2.2. MAJCOMs need to ensure the AFRC and the ANG receive the same level of support as other
     Air Force tenant organizations on their installations. This includes but is not limited to:
        3.2.2.1. Base level support services
        3.2.2.2. Annual tours
        3.2.2.3. Unit training assemblies
        3.2.2.4. Peacetime training in all areas
        3.2.2.5. Weekend operations

3.3. Waivers to Support.
     3.3.1. Requests for a waiver to permit duplication of support functions are appropriate if:
        3.3.1.1. It is more economical
        3.3.1.2. Provision of support is physically impractical
        3.3.1.3. Wartime requirements dictate duplication of facilities or functions
     3.3.2. ANG and AFRC receivers do not require a duplication waiver if their requirement is based on
     a wartime mission of their gaining MAJCOM.
     3.3.3. To obtain a waiver, the receiving MAJCOM should send a waiver request to the supplying
     MAJCOM, including confirmation of whether or not the receiving MAJCOM accepts responsibility
     for the financial and manpower costs of supporting the waiver. The receiving MAJCOM then requests
     the waiver from HQ USAF/ILGC. If approved, the waiver will normally be valid for three years and a
     copy of it should be attached to the relevant support agreement.
     3.3.3. (ACC) When there appears to be a duplication of effort, the ACC supplier discusses the
     requirement for a waiver with the receiver and documents discussion and results, and notifies the
     installation SAM, HQ ACC functional OPR, and A4XP. The Receiver follows procedures in AFI
     25-201, para 3.3.3. to obtain a waiver and provides the Supplying SAM a copy of the request to attach
     to the agreement. If approved by HQ USAF Plans and Integration Division (USAF/A4RX), the
     request is replaced with the approved waiver and a copy of the waiver is provided to HQ ACC/A4XP.

                 SUPPORT AGREEMENT DOCUMENTATION PROCEDURES

4.1. Identifying the Requirement.
   4.1.1. The potential receiver identifies support requirements to the proposed supplier by official cor-
   respondence and if possible, sets up a face-to-face meeting to clarify respective requirements and
   capabilities, including mission, equipment types, and personnel. Typical questions to be resolved
   include:
       4.1.1.1. How will the potential receiver request support from the supplier?
       4.1.1.2. Who will receive the support?
       4.1.1.3. What type and level of support will be required?
       4.1.1.4. Are there non-standard conditions related to the request for support?
       4.1.1.5. What is the objective or mission supported?
       4.1.1.6. When will the support be provided?
       4.1.1.7. Have all support categories been considered?
       4.1.1.8. Where will the support be provided?
       4.1.1.9. Does the receiver have any contracts with contractors where the government has agreed
       to provide base support?
       4.1.1.10. Does the receiver have an existing Requirements Contract that precludes supplier from
       providing requested support or duplicate services already provided in the contract?
   4.1.2. Any doubts as to exactly what support is needed must be clarified before the support agreement
   is approved.

4.2. Drafting - Support Responsibilities.
   4.2.1. The SAM ensures population, equipment, and aircraft requiring support are identified and
   defined.
   4.2.2. The supplier SAM prepares a draft agreement to identify support, using the support category
   listings found in Enclosure 6 to DoDI 4000.19 and Attachment 5 to this AFI. Categories not included
   in previously cited references must be approved by MAJCOM.
   4.2.3. All affected parties, including the receiver and supplier’s functional areas should review and
   coordinate the draft agreement. SAMs should ensure that their FAACs fully understand the implica-
   tions of the agreement in their respective areas and note that questions on the capability to support the
   receivers are best coordinated directly between FAACs and receivers.
   4.2.4. SAMs should ensure that all attachments to support agreements are listed in Block 11 of the
   DD Form 1144.
   4.2.5. The SAM ensures specific provisions in all support agreements are identified and defined.

4.3. Drafting - Financial Responsibilities.
18                                                           AFI25-201_ACCSUP_I 20 AUGUST 2007


     4.3.1. The local FM assists support providers in identifying what the receiver pays for, including its
     basis and estimated reimbursements, on the DD Form 1144 and its funding annex (See Attchment 9 –
     Support Agreement Reimbursement Matrix).
     4.3.2. FM and DFAS organizations will detail all costs billed to the receiver to include the following:
        4.3.2.1. Relevant support categories.
        4.3.2.2. Computation details of the reimbursables.
        4.3.2.3. Frequency of billing (e.g. monthly, quarterly, or annually).
     4.3.3. Interservice and Intragovernmental receivers will normally be charged for direct incremental
     costs only, as per DoDI 4000.19, paragraph 4.6. Reimbursement policy for intraservice agreements is
     covered by AFI 65-601, Volume I.
     4.3.4. Local FM personnel will record all reimbursement computations in sufficient detail to provide
     an audit trail by clearly documenting computation methods, factor sources, and results. In addition,
     the Funding Annex should include sufficient documentation to satisfy the financial concerns of the
     receiver. The Funding Annex must include program element code, any statutory limitations applicable
     to the program element code, funds expiration date for obligated purpose, method of reimbursement,
     method of recording obligations, and name and phone number of the originator of the document.
     4.3.5. Reimbursement should be understood to mean the transfer of funds from one agency to
     another, not the exchange of services.
     4.3.6. Note that non-standard rules apply to certain ’Providers of Public Goods or Services’, ’Mutual
     Benefits’ and other specific exceptions, as detailed at Attachment 6.
     4.3.7. If current Air Force standard base level accounting systems do not directly correlate identifica-
     tion of incurred expenses with the support categories outlined in DoDI 4000.19, then estimation of
     anticipated reimbursements should be based on:
        4.3.7.1. General and specific provisions of the agreement.
        4.3.7.2. Reasonable projections of required levels and amounts of support.
        4.3.7.3. Generally accepted cost analysis techniques and principles.

4.4. Drafting - Manpower and Organization Responsibilities.
     4.4.1. The installation Manpower and Organization Flight identifies required manpower in the man-
     power annex to support the additional workload. (Suggested format in Attachment 8)
     4.4.2. The manpower annex will detail the following:
        4.4.2.1. Computation method.
        4.4.2.2. Man-hour or manpower impact by functional area/support category.
        4.4.2.3. Total manpower impact in whole numbers.
     4.4.3. Current Air Force Functional Account Codes and Air Force Manpower Standards do not corre-
     late to support categories in DoDI 4000.19. Manpower impacts will be based on:
        4.4.3.1. Specific provision of the agreement.
AFI25-201_ACCSUP_I 20 AUGUST 2007                                                                     19


      4.4.3.2. Air Force Manpower Standards.
      4.4.3.3. Management engineering methods (technical estimates, good operator timing, position
      manning, operational audits, etc).
   4.4.4. The man-hours required to support the additional workload will be totaled and the manpower
   will be computed using the Man-hour Availability Factor. The Manpower and Organization Flight
   will document and maintain on file all computations in sufficient detail to provide an audit trail of
   required manpower.
   4.4.5. Interservice Support Agreements causing a manpower impact need to be worked between the
   Manpower staffs of Headquarters Air Force and the affected service.
   4.4.5. (ACC) Approval of the support agreement will not be delayed awaiting actual transfer of man-
   power authorizations. However, it is recommended to advise the Receiver that services may be
   delayed until manpower is actually obtained and available to the Supplier, if applicable.

4.5. Contract Provided Support.
   4.5.1. When a receiving unit requests support that is provided to the supplier via a base support con-
   tract, a formal support agreement is necessary. Base contract support costs are reimbursable IAW
   DoDI 4000.19, paragraph 4.6 and AFI 65-601, Vol. 1, as applicable.
   4.5.2. Each functional category provided by a base contractor will be documented in broad, general
   terms IAW enclosure 6 to DoDI 4000.19, or Attachment 5 to this AFI, or the supplier’s support capa-
   bility catalog.
   4.5.3. Neither specific reference to the supporting contract number nor detailed wording contained in
   the contract will be included.
   4.5.4. Receiving activity requests for changes in support must be routed through the SAM and for-
   warded to the appropriate Point of Contact (POC) for contract impact review. Contract modification
   costs resulting from receiving activity requests are the responsibility of the receiving activity.
   4.5.5. To prevent the appearance of impropriety, the contractor will not serve as the FAAC for the
   contractor provided support.

             SUPPORT AGREEMENT PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES

5.1. Preparing and Revising Agreements.
     5.1.1. When a new agreement, revision, review, waiver, or termination is required, SAMs should
     ensure all relevant functional offices are notified and to this end they must retain POC details for all
     offices involved. An agreements processing flow chart for the process is at Figure 5.1.
     5.1.2. When there is a procedural conflict among MAJCOMs, the supplier MAJCOM procedures will
     take precedence, as long as the supplier MAJCOM procedures do not significantly impact the
     receiver’s mission.
     5.1.3. (Added-ACC) The SAMS is mandatory within ACC. Waivers for use of SAMS must be
     obtained from ACC/A4XP.
        5.1.3.1. (Added-ACC) Support for using SAMS will be provided by ACC/A4XP when there is
        no functional support office identified by HQ USAF.
        5.1.3.2. (Added-ACC) Within SAMS, enter the third series of numbers in the Local ID block.
        5.1.3.3. (Added-ACC) The Status field in SAMS must be updated and the reimbursable/
        non-reimbursable costs should be current before exporting to HQ ACC/A4XP.
        5.1.3.4. (Added-ACC) Enter “//SIGNED//” in block 8(4) for all agreements “in effect”.

5.2. Coordination.
     5.2.1. Coordination guidelines are as follows:
        5.2.1.1. SAMs produce the initial or revised draft of an agreement and then ensure it is coordi-
        nated in writing by all parties concerned (See Attachment 7).
        5.2.1.1. (ACC) Coordination through FAACS (other than those listed in AFI 25-201, para
        5.2.1.2.) is not necessary if standard support from a current ISSC is requested in the support agree-
        ment and there are no reimbursements to validate.
        5.2.1.2. SAMs staff the agreement to Manpower, Financial Management, the Staff Judge Advo-
        cate (SJA), the Environmental Planning Function, and Security Forces for coordination and DD
        Form 1144 continuation statements, and signatures, as appropriate. However, the JA review will
        occur after all other coordination comments have been made and appropriate changes incorpo-
        rated. Figure 5.2. shows the manpower review process.
            5.2.1.2.1. (Added-ACC) When facilities are involved, the SAM should also coordinate the
            agreement with the civil engineer office to ensure all civil engineering and real estate concerns
            are addressed in the support agreement.
            5.2.1.2.2. (Added-ACC) When RM support is required, ensure coordination between host
            and tenant RM offices is accomplished.
        5.2.1.3. SAMs should check the completed coordination sheets for errors or changes that may
        create an impasse and transfer any amendments into the master draft agreement.
AFI25-201_ACCSUP_I 20 AUGUST 2007                                                                         21


       5.2.1.4. (Added-ACC) The SAM should set timelines for agreements in the coordination pro-
       cess. The initial/re-accomplished agreement is forwarded to the FAACs normally with a two-week
       suspense for reply. Follow-up should be initiated at the end of the two weeks. If required, a second
       follow-up is submitted. No response after one month from the 2nd follow-up, the SAM should
       consider documenting the coordination efforts and attach to Part 3 of the agreement folder. A sam-
       ple coordination tracking sheet is provided at Attachment 11 (Added).

5.3. Approval and Signature.
   5.3.1. The SAM:
       5.3.1.1. Prepares a letter to transmit a copy of the final draft support agreement to the supplier
       Comptroller for approval signature.
       5.3.1.2. Prepares a letter transmitting the original agreement to receiver. This letter should explain
       any apparent anomalies and their rationale. If receiver requests further changes, then renegotiate
       the disputed issues and, after legal review of any substantive changes, have the approving official
       sign and return the original agreement.
       5.3.1.3. Obtains final approval signature. Insert the date of Supplier Approving Official’s signa-
       ture in Block 3 (effective date) of the DD Form 1144 unless otherwise stated in Block 11.
       5.3.1.4. Determines the number of copies required and forwards them to the parties concerned.
       5.3.1.4. (ACC) Provide one electronic copy to HQ ACC/A4XP via the quarterly SAMS export.
       5.3.1.5. Consolidates correspondence and coordination that documents significant changes, and
       retains it for the next review cycle.

5.4. Review and Revision of Support Agreements.
   5.4.1. Annual FM Budget Review.
       5.4.1.1. Ensures continued accuracy of estimated reimbursement charges and coincides with bud-
       get lead-time requirements and Financial Plan preparation.
       5.4.1.2. Does not involve a renegotiation unless there are significant changes in support require-
       ments.
       5.4.1.3. Reviews estimated support requirements prior to the annual budget submission. A
       revised Funding Annex (if required), signed by both supplier and receiver FMs, will then be for-
       warded to the SAM to be included as an attachment to the agreement.
NOTE: There is no need to route the agreement through the final approval authorities. Figure 5.3. shows
an Annual Budget Review flow chart of the process.
       5.4.1.3. (ACC) The Installation SAM updates the SAM system with changes resulting from any
       budget reviews. Work directly with the FAAC when there is a question of reimbursements or lack
       of reimbursements as identified in the FAAC specific provisions on file, per para 2.2.1.4.
   5.4.2. Triennial Review.
       5.4.2.1. A triennial review consists of the agreement being reviewed in its entirety, by all applica-
       ble FAACs. If the agreement requires significant changes, it is updated with new or revised stan-
       dard terms, and approved as per the original (requires new signatures). If, after complete FAAC
22                                                           AFI25-201_ACCSUP_I 20 AUGUST 2007


        review, the agreement does not require significant changes, a letter is sent to the supplier or
        receiver to identify that a review was completed with no significant changes required. At that time
        a triennial (or major) review is considered complete and only the effective date in Block 3 of the
        DD Form 1144 is updated (no new signatures required).
        5.4.2.1. (ACC) Triennial reviews are not required for AF to Non-AF agreements, as these agree-
        ments are governed by DoDI 4000.19. However, annual financial reviews are still required to
        ensure Air Force resources are captured and reimbursed.
        5.4.2.2. A triennial review is initiated by the supplier SAM at least 120 days from the 3 year anni-
        versary of the agreement’s effective date. However, MAJCOMs are authorized to defer triennial
        reviews if a major review has been completed in the interim, in which case the three-year period
        will begin from the date of the last major review. The agreement should be completed by the
        review date.
        5.4.2.2. (ACC) When ACC is the receiver and the supplier has not initiated review within 90 days
        from the 3 year anniversary of the effective date, it will then become the responsibility of the ACC
        Receiver to initiate a request to the Supplier for a triennial review. Document the contact that was
        initiated and attach to Part 3 of the agreement folder. If necessary, request assistance from ACC/
        A4XP.
        5.4.2.3. SAMs ensure that all FAACs review standard levels of support, basis for reimbursement,
        and estimated reimbursements to determine whether they are still current and that the triennial
        review is documented.
        5.4.2.4. When an agreement is re-accomplished by a triennial review with significant changes and
        new signatures, Blocks 1, 2, and 3 of DD Form 1144 will be changed accordingly. The supplying
        activity address code and sequential number will normally remain the same as long as the agree-
        ment is in existence.
        5.4.2.5. MAJCOMs are authorized to waive triennial reviews for their installations which are
        within two years of closure.
        5.4.2.6. MAJCOMs are authorized to waive triennial reviews for support agreements serviced
        100 percent by BOS contractors. Review dates will be established that precede development of the
        new contract’s Statement of Work (SOW), normally 9 months prior to contract expiration. At a
        minimum, frequency between reviews shall be limited to a maximum of 5 years.
     5.4.3. Minor Revisions. Minor pen and ink changes, including non-substantive modifications, may be
     made by mutual agreement provided they do not significantly affect manpower or funds.
     5.4.3. (ACC) Minor Revisions. Minor pen and ink changes agreed to between the Supplier and/or
     Receiver SAM must be documented and maintained in Part 4 of the agreement folder. All pen and ink
     changes must be incorporated in the next review/revision.

5.5. Resolving Impasses.
     5.5.1. As a general rule, impasses should be resolved at the lowest possible level and only elevated to
     higher authority when the local negotiation process is exhausted. The following rules apply:
AFI25-201_ACCSUP_I 20 AUGUST 2007                                                                        23


      5.5.1.1. If an impasse concerning an overall agreement cannot be resolved between the supplier
      and receiver within a reasonable amount of time, then both SAMs pass details to their MAJCOM
      counterparts for resolution.
      5.5.1.1. (ACC) SAMs should notify ACC/A4XP when an impasse cannot be resolved within 120
      days. Signature of an agreement should not be withheld due to an impasse. Follow AFI 25-201,
      para 5.5.1.2. for impasse procedures.
      5.5.1.2. If an impasse relating to a specific support category cannot be resolved at installation
      level then both FAACs pass details to their MAJCOM counterparts for resolution with copies to
      their installation SAMs and MAJCOM support agreement program managers. Omit the impasse
      category of support from the support agreement and include the following statement in DD Form
      1144, Block 11, and General Provisions that “Due to an impasse in negotiating support for cate-
      gory XXXX, this agreement is being processed with an impasse.”
      5.5.1.3. MAJCOMs should advise HQ USAF/ILGC of any formal impasse outstanding for more
      than 180 days.
      5.5.1.4. Upon resolution of an impasse, correspondence documenting the resolution process will
      become part of the agreement file.

5.6. Reduction, Modification or Termination of Support.
   5.6.1. If an agreement is unilaterally terminated, suspended or significantly modified with less than
   180 days notice to other parties of the agreement, the unilateral party may be billed by affected parties
   for reimbursement of unavoidable termination or re-procurement expenses incurred up to 180 days
   following the written notification.
   5.6.2. The supplier FAAC will ensure that final charges for support are submitted NLT 90 days after
   receipt of notification of termination of support.
   5.6.3. Installation SAMs are to notify HQ USAF/ILGC, through their MAJCOM SAMs, prior to the
   issue of any unilateral termination notice.

                                  SPECIAL SUPPORT CONDITIONS

A6.1. Providers of Public Goods or Services.
The following categories are providers of public goods or services as per current Air Force Directives:
Community Service Organizations such as the American Red Cross, the Boy/Girl Scouts, Civil Air Patrol,
and United Seamen’s Service are not charged for base support services. If an installation can identify
funds used to support these organizations, the installation commander can choose to fund these costs
within the existing budget.
Regulated Service Organizations such as a bank or credit union are charged for base support services on
the basis of existing directives or contract. Support agreements are not used. Refer to DoD FMR 7000.14,
Vol 5, Chapter 34 for further information on banks and credit unions.

A6.2. Mutual Benefit.
In some instances it is not appropriate to charge for certain services provided to local government when
such services are of mutual reciprocal benefit (e.g., agreements with fire departments to provide mutual
aid in the event of local disasters). Additional information regarding support to civilian authorities is cov-
ered in AFI 10-802.

A6.3. Army Veterinary Service.
Status of the US Army Veterinary Service on USAF installations is governed by an MOU of 20 Aug 2003
between the Surgeons General of the two Services. It specifies that “US Army Veterinary Service is con-
sidered an integral part of the local Air Force medical staff and as such is not considered a tenant on the
Air Force base”.
A6.3. (ACC) The Army Veterinary Service is not considered a tenant; therefore, a Support Agreement
(DD Form 1144) is not required for common services, which are the same services provided to non-tenant
units. A wing-level MOA should be established specifying the services/support provided to the host and
the veterinary unit. The MOA should follow the format in AFI 25-201, Attachment 4.

A6.4. United States Postal Service (USPS).
Status of USPS offices on military installations is governed by the US Postal Service Handbook PO-630,
Post Offices Serving DoD Installations, April 2000. In effect, this commits DoD to provide “adequate
facilities for civilian post offices located at military installations solely in support of the unit’s mission.
Utilities and local telephone service shall be furnished on a reimbursable basis”.

A6.5. Aviation Engine Oil Samples.
AFI 21-124 provides for non-depot Oil Analysis Program laboratories to provide Nondestructive Inspec-
tions lab analysis of aero engine oil samples in accordance with DoD policy.
44                                                       AFI25-201_ACCSUP_I 20 AUGUST 2007


A6.6. Service Level Agreements.
Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are initiated as required by communications directives and are techni-
cal arrangements that fall outside of the normal support agreement program as governed by this instruc-
tion. Information about SLAs are located in AFI 33-115.
A6.7. (Added-ACC) Document Automation and Production Services (DAPS). The current Support
Agreement between HQ Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and HQ USAF (ILC) is that, “DAPS will be a

        incurred.
     4. Reimbursable except for common and joint-use communication facilities
     5. Reimbursable if additional facilities are required to handle the increase in patronage

     9. Tenant funds for off-base facilities whether work is done by the host work force or by contract,
        and on-base minor construction projects with funded cost over $2,000. The tenant also typically
        funds anything beyond this amount, to include actual MILCON. This is because the tenant is
        ostensibly reconfiguring the facility for their unique needs and such efforts are above and beyond
        the standard baseline service everyone else on base receives. The critical question to ask is if the
        building work is to maintain the basic, original integrity of the facility or is it unique to the user in
        that it changes the original form, fit, or function of the facility.
     10. Reimbursable for non-active duty – non-reimbursable for active duty
     11. Unusual, unique, or inordinate security requirements are reimbursable

*NOTE: Most interservice or interagency support is reimbursable provided the basis of reimbursement
calculation meets the criteria found in DoDI 4000.19, paragraph 4.6, Reimbursement.


**NOTE: Policy and methodology for determining reimbursement costs are found in DoD 7000.14-R,
Vol. 11A. chap 1.

as stated in AFI 65-601, Vol I, chap 7, Para 7.5.4.
