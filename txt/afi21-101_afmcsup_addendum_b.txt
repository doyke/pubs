The CPSD applicability to AFI 21-101 and AFMC Supplement 1 is minimal; therefore, logistics
maintenance requirements will be published in this AFI 21-101, AFMC Supplement 1,
Addendum B. It addresses the applicable responsibilities based on the CPSD missions and
requires written procedures that meet the intent of AFI 21-101.

1. Overview. This instruction prescribes the basic programs to be used in CPSD and provides
senior management, middle management, maintenance supervisors, and technicians’ direction
for accomplishment of maintenance management. The affected CPSD branches are three distinct
mission areas requiring development of separate guidance. The branches are expected to
effectively use the resources assigned to ensure mission accomplishment. Program managers are
required to establish guidance and may use additional management procedures not specifically
prohibited by this instruction, any technical order, or other applicable instruction. Supervisors at
all levels are responsible to ensure this directive is fully implemented. In the event of a conflict
between this instruction and Technical Orders (TO), TOs will take precedence.
2. Compliance Terminology. For the purposes of this instruction, the following definitions
apply:
     2.1. Shall, Must, Will - Indicate mandatory requirements. (Will is also used to express a
     declaration of purpose for a future event.)
     2.2. Should - Indicates a preferred method of accomplishment.
     2.3. May - Indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
3. Waivers. Any waivers to this or higher headquarters directives shall be processed in
accordance with the specific policy directive. If no specific form or format is specified, submit
waiver requests through the branch chief to Division QA, for staffing to the Division Chief,
using the template at Attachment 2 of this addendum, with further staffing through the
functional chain to higher headquarters as applicable.
4. Policy Development. At a minimum, the affected CPSD branches will publish specific
policy guidance (Operating Instructions (OI)) in the appropriate publication series as required for
the programs outlined in this instruction.
5. Maintenance Support Programs. The following programs will be implemented in the Intel
and Force Protection Products and Space COMSEC Branches.
     5.1. Maintenance Program Responsibilities. Branches will establish written policy indicating
     the responsibilities for key leaders involved in their maintenance activities. Due to diversity

       5.7.18. Procedures to manage locally manufactured, developed, or modified tools and
       equipment.
    5.8. Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Prevention Program. FOD is damage caused by foreign
    object debris (i.e. a substance, debris or article alien to a vehicle, system or support
    equipment that has potential to cause damage). Though TAP, CSSA, and Space COMSEC
    maintenance operations are not on or near airfield operations, the intent of the FOD program
    will be captured in this section. Maintenance areas will need to adopt and practice within
    their area of responsibility the tenets of the AF FOD Prevention Program.
       5.8.1. As a tenant unit on Lackland AFB, branch personnel will comply with host
       directives governing FOD if they travel or perform maintenance on the base airfield,
       taxiways and aircraft parking ramps.
       5.8.2. Responsibilities:
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_ADDENDUM_B 17 AUGUST 2012                                                    5


        5.8.2.1. The branch chiefs will ensure personnel comply with the intent of this FOD
        Prevention Program.
        5.8.2.2. Branches will appoint a FOD Monitor who will:
            5.8.2.2.1. Keep FOD in the forefront through awareness.
            5.8.2.2.2. Address FOD concerns, noted during inspections and evaluations, in
            MSEP reports.
        5.8.2.3. Supervisors will stress the importance of the FOD prevention program to
        eliminate foreign object (FO) hazards while personnel perform assigned duties. FOD
        awareness will be included in the technician’s initial briefing to the work center.
     5.8.3. Preventing FOD.
        5.8.3.1. There are many causes of FOD. Two major contributors are poor
        housekeeping and poor work habits such as not accounting for hardware, safety wire,
        tools, etc., during maintenance. All loose objects, regardless of their origin, can cause
        catastrophic and costly damage to vehicles, systems, or support equipment.
        5.8.3.2. FOD awareness and prevention is everyone’s responsibility. Some FOD
        prevention practices are listed below.
            5.8.3.2.1. Keep areas free of FO by maintaining cleanliness in maintenance and
            manufacturing areas at all times.
            5.8.3.2.2. Accomplish a thorough cleanup by performing FO inspection and
            account for tools used during tasks, at the beginning and completion of each task
            and by performing required toolbox inventories.
            5.8.3.2.3. During clean-up routines, thoroughly inspect work areas for FO.
            5.8.3.2.4. Ensure trash receptacles are present in each work area to allow proper
            disposal of trash.
     5.8.4. FOD Investigation.
        5.8.4.1. Each case of FOD will be investigated by the FOD Monitor to determine the
        cause.
        5.8.4.2. As a result of suspected FOD damage, the vehicle, system or support
        equipment will be considered for impoundment in accordance with paragraph 5.9.
        5.8.4.3. The investigations will use the expertise in maintenance, safety, and other
        unit agencies as needed.
        5.8.4.4. If it is determined the FOD is attributable to personnel error, the supervisor
        will take action to eliminate the opportunities for that error to reoccur.
  5.9. Impoundment Procedures
     5.9.1. Impoundment Authority:      Branch chiefs will appoint Impoundment Authority
     personnel on the branch SCR.

        6.8.2. A major deficiency results in a “Fail” rating.
        6.8.3. The AQL is derived/revised from QA performance-based data. AQLs will be
        determined based on trends associated with the evaluation/inspection process.
        Adjustments to the AQL are reviewed with the appropriate section chief before being
        adjusted accordingly.
        6.8.4. AQLs for work center tasks will be published in the E&I Plan.
     6.9. QA and QA Augmentee will evaluate branch maintenance management procedures,
     including locally developed forms, publications, OIs, and checklists for accuracy, intent, and
     necessity every 2 years.
7. Technical Data. The affected branches will ensure program specific technical data i.e.
Technical Instructions and Air Force Cryptographic Operation and Maintenance Manuals
(AFKAM) that are created or used are managed as required by TO 00-5-1, AF Technical Order
System, AFKAG-1, Air Force COMSEC Publication, Air Force Communications Security
(COMSEC) Operations, and branch guidance.
8. Maintenance Information System (MIS).
