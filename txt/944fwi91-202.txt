SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major
changes include revisions to program responsibilities and safety requirements and updates forms
and references. Specific guidelines are added for marking magazines and use of designated
disinterested officials to certify only blanks are loaded during exercises. A Field Exercise

been added to guide individuals through the process, Attachments 2-4. Step-by-step procedures
are included to request/issue blank ammunition, actions taken in the event of a misfire or during
emergencies, steps to turn in expended/unexpended brass, and guidance for conducting safety
briefings prior to exercises.

       Weapons Handling Manual, Para 4.
       3.1.8. Personnel will re-check all issued exercise magazines at the completion of the
       Weapons Safety Briefing. Note: At no time will any magazines or blank ammunition be
       entered into the exercise other than those issued. Introduction of such magazines and/or
       blank ammunition into an exercise will be considered a clear violation of this operating
