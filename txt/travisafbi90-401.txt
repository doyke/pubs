This instruction implements and references Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 90-4, Relations
with Congress, and Air Force Instruction (AFI) 90-401, Air Force Relations with Congress. The
objective of this instruction is to assist 60th Air Mobility Wing (60 AMW) leadership in properly
coordinating and responding to Presidential, Congressional and other High-Level inquiries. This
instruction establishes procedures and outlines responsibilities within the 60 AMW when contact
is received either directly from an elected official, through official Air Force channels normally
tasked to respond to High-Level inquiries or through MAJCOM functional offices. This
instruction applies to all 60 AMW units.

constitutes a High-Level inquiry. 60 AMW/Public Affairs (60 AMW/PA) will handle all routine
communications from White House staff or Members of Congress. 60 AMW/Judge Advocate
(60 AMW/JA) will follow AFI 51-201, Administration of Military Justice, when responding to
Air Force Legal Operations Agency, Military Justice Division (AFLOA/JAJM). 60th Force
Support Squadron Commander (60 FSS/CC) and 60th Medical Group Commander (60
MDG/CC) should inform the 60 AMW/IG when they receive inquiries directly from the Air
Force Personnel Center IG Investigations and Inquiries Group (AFPC/DSI) or Air Force Surgeon
General (AF/SG) respectively. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
release is required to obtain personal medical information.
1. 60th Air Mobility Wing Policy Regarding High Level Inquiries.
     1.1. Members of the 60 AMW will respond promptly, accurately and fully to all High-Level
     Inquiries. For the purpose of this instruction, High-Level inquiries are defined as requests for
     information originating from the White House and Members of Congress or their staffs that
     go beyond the level of routine communication. High-Level inquiries normally flow via the
     Secretary of the Air Force, Office of Legislative Liaison (SAF/LL), but may come to Travis
     AFB directly from the source.
        1.1.1. High-Level inquiries also include formal requests for information from Air Force
        or MAJCOM functional staffs that are tasked to reply to the offices listed above.
        1.1.2. “Routine communication” is that which is clearly in the public domain, does not
        compromise OPSEC, is not protected under the privacy act, and does not stem from a
        complaint registered by a constituent of an elected official. Examples of routine
        communication include information about planned social activities at Travis AFB;
        information about specific Air Force policies that can be retrieved from published Air
        Force Instructions, policy guides, or other unclassified guidance; information pertaining
        to correspondence with Travis AFB officials; or other general information that facilitates
        healthy professional relationships between Travis AFB and our local elected officials.
     1.2. The 60 AMW Commander is the approval authority for all responses to High-Level
     inquiries. Exception: 60 AMW/JA will follow procedures described in AFI 51-201 when
     responding to requests for information from AFLOA/JAJM.
        1.2.1. The 60 AMW Commander will sign all responses sent to elected officials or their
        staff, General Officers or Air Force and MAJCOM Staff Directors. The 60 AMW
        Commander can delegate this to a Group Commander on a case-by-case basis.
        1.2.2. The appropriate Group Commander will reply to all High-Level inquiries relayed
        by Air Force or MAJCOM functional staff following approval of the response by the 60
        AMW Commander.
     1.3. 60 AMW/PA will manage all routine communications from the White House and
     Members of Congress and their staffs via the 60 AMW/PA Congressional Liaison.
2. Managing High-Level Inquiries.
     2.1. AFI 90-401 provides guidance on Congressional Inquiries. SAF/LL is the agency
     tasked to respond on behalf of the Air Force to all member, staff, and constituent queries
     received from the White House and Members of Congress. Ordinarily, congressional
     members contact the Air Force through the Congressional Inquiry Division (SAF/LLI) who
TRAVISAFBI90-401 13 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                              3


  in turn tasks the appropriate Air Force agency. Queries normally flow from Air Staff to
  MAJCOM functional offices to the unit, via the Inspector General (IG), as necessary to
  obtain the appropriate reply.
     2.1.1. Inquiries regarding personnel are channeled from SAF/LLI through AFPC/DSI.
     AFPC/DSI may forward inquiries directly to the 60 FSS/CC on personnel issues. The IG
     should be notified of the inquiry immediately. Normally, the 60 FSS/CC will coordinate
     the answer with the units in question via e-mail. To answer the inquiry, the 60 FSS/CC
     will task the appropriate organization(s) with questions from the text of the AFPC
     tasking. Each question should be answered thoroughly, yet succinctly, to expedite the
     Wing’s response. The 60 FSS/CC will draft the final response based on the inputs
     received and forward the proposed response through the 60th Mission Support Group
     Commander to the IG for final coordination. The 60 AMW/IG will review and
     coordinate the response through the 60 AMW Judge Advocate’s (JA) office for legal
     review. After JA concurrence, the 60 AMW/IG will forward the proposed response to
     the 60 AMW/CC for approval and release.
     2.1.2. Similarly, inquiries regarding medical issues are channeled from SAF/LLI through
     AF/SG. AF/SG may forward inquiries directly to the 60 MDG/CC or a squadron within
     the 60 MDG. The process should be handled as in paragraph 2.1.1 via the 60 MDG/CC.
     2.1.3. All 60 AMW personnel must evaluate the information requested in terms of its
     classification and local sensitivity. Refer requests for classified information, For Official
     Use Only (FOUO), and locally sensitive information to the Office of the Secretary of the
     Air Force through SAF/LL.
     2.1.4. Unless specifically identified otherwise, information must be protected IAW AFI
     33-332, Air Force Privacy Act Program and DoD Regulation 5400.11, DoD Privacy
     Program. Before release of personal Privacy Act information, the individual tasked with
     answering the query must obtain a Privacy Act Release statement (Attachment 2) from
     the individual in question. For personal medical information, a HIPPA release statement
     is required. Contact the 60 MDG for assistance with HIPPA information.
  2.2. If a High-Level inquiry is received directly by a 60 AMW unit without SAF/LLI
  coordination, contact the 60 AMW/IG for directions on answering the query. The 60
  AMW/IG will contact SAF/LLI to determine response actions to inquiries received outside
  SAF/LL channels. The 60 AMW/IG is responsible for ensuring the 60 AMW/CC is aware of
  all High-Level Inquiries. To expedite a response, the office that received the inquiry should
  begin preparing the response while the 60 AMW/IG determines the appropriate response
  channel. Exception: 60 AMW/JA will follow procedures described in AFI 51-201 when
  responding to requests for information from AFLOA/JAJM.
  2.3. Due to the short suspense normally associated with a High-Level tasking, the preferred
  method to coordinate and answer the inquiry is through e-mail. The office tasked with
  answering the inquiry must ensure that all questions contained in the query are answered. If
  external inputs are necessary, forward excerpts from the inquiry to the appropriate offices
  with your request for inputs. Attempt to protect the identity of the complainant and subjects,
  if practical.

        2.3.1. When information from outside your assigned squadron or group is required,
        initiate contact with the Squadron Commander and courtesy copy the Group Commander
        in your e-mail request. The Squadron Commander will provide the requested
        information to the POC, obtaining Group Commander concurrence if the information is
        being sent to a member outside the Group.
        2.3.2. The POC will draft the response and forward it through their Squadron
        Commander to the Group Commander for review. The Group Commander will review
        the response and forward to the 60 AMW/IG for final coordination. After 60 AMW/JA
        review, 60 AMW/IG will review and forward the completed response to the 60
        AMW/CC for signature.
            2.3.2.1. The 60 AMW/JA and 60 AMW/IG may coordinate twice on the response:
            once upon initial input and a second time if extensive changes are required prior to 60
            AMW/CC approval. If extensive changes occur to the proposed response during
            coordination and any doubt exists regarding the need for additional coordination,
            contact the office in question and determine the requirement.
     2.4. The 60 AMW/CC will respond to all queries received directly from SAF/LL or a
     MAJCOM Director or higher office. While most responses are drafted for 60 AMW/CC
     signature, a statement indicating the 60 AMW/CC approves release of the reply (i.e., an
     electronic AF Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet or endorsement) meets the intent of this
     instruction.
        2.4.1. When replying to a MAJCOM functional office that is preparing a HQ response,
        the 60 AMW/CC will approve the reply and return it to the Group Commander for
        release.
     2.5. If the query does not lend itself to e-mail coordination due to method of receipt, size or
     number of attachments, complete coordination using a hard copy AF Form 1768. To reduce
     delay, provide each office tasked to answer the query a copy of the AF Form 1768 and
     indicate the form has been “shot gunned” to the offices listed. Clearly identify the
     information requested from each office either on the AF Form 1768 or as a Tab to the AF
     Form 1768.
        2.5.1. Offices tasked to provide information should provide both hardcopy signed by the
        appropriate commander and a disk containing the same information. The info on the disk
        will be used by the POC to draft the final response.
     2.6. The POC will provide the 60 AMW/IG a copy of the response after 60 AMW/CC
     approval. The 60 AMW/IG will post a copy of the response in the Automated Case Tracking
     System (ACTS) case file database maintained by SAF/IGQ.
3. Forms Adopted. AF Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet, AF Form 847, Recommendation for
Change of Publication.

                    SAMPLE PRIVACY ACT RELEASE STATEMENT

Figure A2.1. Sample Privacy Act Release Statement.
1. Formal requests from SAF/LLI and AFPC/DSI may include notification that a Privacy Act
Release statement is required and provide an example of the verbiage to use. Direct contact from
Congressional staff members and requests for information from MAJCOM functionals often do
not provide the same guidance.

2. When personally identifiable Information in a record is requested by the subject of the record
or the subject's attorney, notarization of the request or a statement certifying under the penalty of
perjury that their identity is true and correct may be required. Additionally, written consent of
the subject of the records is required for disclosure from a Privacy Act system of records, even to
the subject's attorney.

3. In the absence of a recommended Privacy Act release statement, if personal information is
required to answer the inquiry, the following statement, on official letterhead, may be used:


I, (print name) __________________________________, authorize/decline (circle one) release
of Privacy Act information obtained from this inquiry to (name of individual initiating request)
____________________________.

I declare under penalty of perjury (if outside the United States, add "under the laws of the United
States of America") that the foregoing is true and correct.
