                                           Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Air Traffic Control (ATC) Flying issues. The 81 OSF/CC is the primary individual
responsible for interaction with civilian Air Traffic Control (ATC) agencies concerning ATC
issues outside Keesler’s class Delta airspace, or as designated by the 81 TRW/CV. All units
operating from Keesler experiencing Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) related ATC issues
will inform the 81 OSF/CC and 81 OSF/OSAT Chief Controller (CCTLR).
1.2. Airfield Operations. The Keesler airfield operational hours are: 0800L – 2300L Monday
through Friday, 1100L – 1700L Saturday and Sunday and 1300L – 2300L on Unit Training
Assemblies (UTA) Sundays to accommodate the 403d Wing shuttles. Keesler’s airfield hours of
operation are published in the Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) Supplement. The airfield may be
opened for use between published closed hours and on federal holidays to support mission
essential flight operations (i.e., MEDEVAC, storm missions and higher headquarters-directed
missions). The airfield is normally closed on federal holidays.
   1.2.1. Mission Essential Operations.            Coordinate all mission essential aircraft
   arrivals/departures scheduled for after-hours operations with 81 OSF Airfield Management
   Operations (AMOPS) or Keesler Command Post (81 TRW/CP) when AMOPS is closed.
   Note: 81 TRW/CP will notify CCTLR, on-call AMOPS and Weather personnel whenever
   there is any change in after-hours aircraft operations such as a change in aircraft arrival time.
   1.2.2. After Hours Opening. The 81 OSF/CC obtains 81 TRW/CV approval for unscheduled
   airfield openings through coordination with 81 TRW/CP. 81 TRW/CP notifies AMOPS,
   Tower, and Weather standby personnel immediately upon receipt of a no-notice mission
   essential tasking requiring airfield support. AMOPS will open a minimum of two hours prior
   to the first scheduled storm tasking departure and one hour prior to arrival. AMOPS will
   open one hour prior to all other mission essential departures. Both the Tower and AMOPS
   will remain open for one hour after an aircraft has departed or unless it has been pre-
   coordinated with & approved by 403rd/53rd Squadron Operations leadership to close prior to
   the one hour timeframe. Upon arrival, once the aircraft is in the chocks and the engines are
   off, the Tower and AMOPS will close.
   1.2.3. AMOPS will submit a NOTAM when the airfield is opened/closed outside published
   hours. The Tower will not approve any aircraft to taxi or land until AMOPS gives the Tower
   a valid flight plan for the aircraft and control of the Controlled Movement Area (CMA). The
   Tower will withhold the aircraft’s clearance and/or engine start until they have control of the
   CMA and the flight plan from AMOPS. An aircraft that declares an in-flight emergency may
   be allowed to land. For unscheduled arrivals/departures, the response time for airfield
   operations and weather personnel is one hour. Note: The airfield will be open with the
   appropriate NOTAM 30 minutes prior to scheduled after-hours storm taskings or other
   mission essential sorties, IAW AFI 13-204v3 IC 1 Chapter 3 procedures.
   1.2.4. 81 TRW/CP will be notified by agencies of all operations that utilize the taxiways/
   runway, grounds maintenance operations on the airfield and engine runs/aircraft tows during
   times when the Tower is closed/unmanned.

     1.3.4. Landing Zone (LZ) markings are established for both runways in accordance with
     Engineering Technical Letter (ETL) 09-6 Change 1: C-130 and C-17 Landing Zone
     Dimensional, Marking and Lighting Criteria. The LZ markings consist of four non-reflective
     white markings, 10 feet by 5.5 feet, applied in the same pattern as Visual Landing Zone
     Marking Panels (VLZMP) for the AMP-3 configuration. The 500 feet touchdown zone for
     both runways is established by the four markings. The markings are placed 30 feet from the
     runway centerline representing a 60 feet wide LZ.
     1.3.5. The Runway 03 LZ touchdown zone starts just past Taxiway Charlie and ends just
     past Taxiway Delta. The Runway 21 LZ touchdown zone starts just prior to the runway
     aiming point/Fixed Distance Markings and ends just prior to the Touchdown Markings.
     1.3.6. Displaced Threshold (Keyhole) Dimensions and Surface. Runway 21: First 200 x
     150 feet is concrete. The next 800 x 75 feet is concrete with 37.5 feet of non-weight bearing
     asphalt edge on each side. Runway 03: First 200 x 150 feet is concrete. The next 800 x 75
     feet is concrete with 37.5 feet of non-weight bearing asphalt edge on each side. The
     remaining 599 x 150 feet to the displaced threshold is concrete. The overall runway length is
     7,630 feet x 150 feet.
     1.3.7. Aircrews will not land prior to the displaced runway thresholds. However, the
     opposite end displaced threshold is authorized for use during landing roll out. Aircrews
     can/may use portions of the runway prior to the displaced thresholds to begin takeoff roll.
     The area past the opposite threshold will not be used for takeoff computations.
     1.3.8. Distance remaining markers indicate distance remaining on landing roll out only, and
     include the lengths of respective displaced thresholds. The effective runway length for
     touch-and-go operations is 5,031 feet (distance between thresholds).
     1.3.9. Large-frame and heavy aircraft aircrews will make 180-degree turns only on the fully
     stressed concrete portions of the North/South keyholes to prevent possible damage to the
     surrounding asphalt.
KEESLEAFBI13-201 16 April 2013                                                                   9


   1.3.10. Taxiways Alpha, Charlie, Delta are 75-feet wide. Taxiway Echo is 50-feet wide and
   is limited to small-frame aircraft (no C-130 ops unless the aircrews are assault trained C-130
   crews). Taxiways Bravo and Foxtrot are 205-feet wide.
   1.3.11. Heavy aircraft (i.e., C-17s) will utilize Taxiways Bravo and Foxtrot to taxi to and
   from the runway via Taxiway Alpha.
   1.3.12. Aircraft with wingspans larger than C-130s will not be allowed to taxi on taxiway
   Alpha behind Ramp 1 when C-130s are parked in Spots 1 - 14 due to a lack of required
   wingtip clearance.
1.4. Runway Selection Procedures. AMOPS must conduct an airfield check before opening
the airfield IAW AFI 13-204v3 IC 1. Runway 21 is designated as the calm wind runway. The
Tower watch supervisor or senior controller (WS/SC) is the designated authority for selecting the
active runway. The runway most nearly aligned with the wind will be used when the wind is
five knots or greater.
   1.4.1. The Tower will notify Gulfport Approach, AMOPS, Weather, Fire Department and 81
   TRW/CP when changing the runway in use.
1.5. Controlled Movement Area (CMA). Approval is required from the Tower (Ground
Control) prior to entry into the CMA. Vehicles and persons on foot must have two-way radio
communications with the Tower to gain access to the CMA. All agencies utilizing the taxiways
and runway and grounds maintenance operations on the airfield when the Tower is
closed/unmanned must contact 81 TRW/CP when entering and exiting the CMA.
   1.5.1. The CMA includes the runway, Taxiway’s Alpha (dashed yellow lines at Alpha and
   the Back Line denotes CMA) through Foxtrot, the grass infield and any portion of the airfield
   perimeter existing within 100 feet of the runway edge or end and the Localizer Critical Area
   (refer to Keesler AFB Instruction 13-213, Airfield Driving Instruction).
   1.5.2. Taxiway Alpha does not provide sufficient room for vehicles to operate on the paved
   surface behind aircraft with engines running on spots 1-14. Aircraft engine runs on other
   spots listed below may create a conflict for vehicles on the CMA.
   1.5.3. Time permitting, the Tower Ground Controller will provide an advisory to vehicles in
   the CMA regarding aircraft with engines running on Spots 1 - 16, 24 - 25, 29 - 30.
   1.5.4. Once the advisory has been given by the controller, it is the vehicle driver’s
   responsibility to access their destination on the airfield without driving behind an aircraft
   with running engines.
   1.5.5. Vehicles must remain alert for light gun signals from the Tower in the event of radio
   failure. If it appears the vehicle and/or personnel are not responding to the light gun signals,
   the Tower will turn the runway or taxiway lights on and off (flash) to indicate that personnel
   and vehicles must immediately exit the runway or area. The Tower will notify AMOPS to
   contact or recall all personnel from the CMA who do not immediately comply with the
   Tower’s instructions. Note: Flashing the runway lights entails stepping the runway lights up
   to step 5, then down to step 1, then back to step 5 in a continuous fashion.
1.6. Airfield Lighting. The airfield lighting system is activated by controllers in the Tower
IAW Federal Aviation Administration Order (FAAO) Joint Order 7110.65 and AFI 13-204v3 IC
1. See IFR Supplement for instrument approach lighting systems. The Tower will notify
 10                                                          KEESLEAFBI13-201 16 April 2013


AMOPS of all outages/unsatisfactory reports on the airfield lighting systems. Only AMOPS,
Airfield Lighting personnel are authorized to contact Energy Management and Control System
(EMCS) at 228-377-4179 to operate airfield lighting systems when the Tower is
closed/unmanned. Maintenance of the airfield lighting touch screen in the Tower will be
coordinated with Airfield Lighting.
      1.6.1. The rotating beacon is located 4/10 of a mile East of the Control Tower on top of a
      water tower.
   1.6.2. Runway 21 has: High Intensity Runway Lights (HIRLs), ALSF-1 Approach Lights
   with Sequencing Flashing Lights (SFLs), Precision Approach Path Indicator lights (PAPI)
   and threshold lights. The Runway 21 LZ has IR (Infrared) lighting established in the AMP-3
   configuration. Note: Keesler has a non-standard ALSF-1 that is 2,400 feet long as opposed
   to the requirement of 3,000 feet long due to the Back Bay waterway.
   1.6.3. Runway 03 has: PAPIs, Runway End Identifier Lights (REILs), HIRLs and threshold
   lights. The Runway 03 LZ has IR lighting established in the AMP-3 configuration.
   1.6.4. The Tower activates the Ploesti Drive traffic lights to protect vehicular and air traffic
   during the following scenarios:
         1.6.4.1. When aircraft utilize the Runway 21 Keyhole for takeoff, activate the traffic
         light. Additionally, when aircraft are landing Runway 03, Tower will activate the traffic
         light at pilot request or when deemed necessary at the Tower Watch Supervisor’s
         discretion. The light shall be activated before the aircraft enters the runway for back taxi
         to account for jet blast affecting pedestrians on the I-81 track and cars on Ploesti Drive.
         Notify 81 SFS of cars that run the light.
Note: The light shall not be turned off by the Control Tower due to departure delays if aircraft
are holding position in the Runway 21 Keyhole.
         1.6.4.2. To protect the Glide Slope Critical Area for Runway 21 (ceiling below 800 feet
         and/or visibility less than two miles) when aircraft are on an Instrument Landing System
         (ILS) approach to Runway 21 (see para 1.22).
         1.6.4.3. To protect the approach light-plane after sunset or during inclement weather
         IAW UFC 3-535-01, Visual Air Navigation Facilities. Activate the lights when aircraft
         are within five flying miles of the airfield on an ILS or Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN)
         approach to Runway 21 at night.

   1.14.4. Hot Pit Refueling Areas. The designated hot pit refueling area is on Spot 24 at
   Taxiway Bravo. These procedures will only be utilized during contingency operations.
KEESLEAFBI13-201 16 April 2013                                                                  13


   1.14.5. Combat Offload/On load Area. The designated combat offload/on load area is
   Taxiway Alpha near the Backline (refer to Keesler AFB Instruction 13-201, Page 47, Para
   6.41).
1.15. Aircraft Towing Procedures. Aircraft tows shall yield to taxiing aircraft. For safety and
anti-theft/hijack procedures, maintenance members involved with aircraft tows must establish
and maintain radio contact with the Tower (Ground Control) before the tow begins. All tows
will be coordinated and follow established procedures. Aircraft tows are authorized only under
one of the following conditions: That the aircraft tow has been pre-coordinated with Tower
(when the airfield is open) or Command Post (when the airfield is closed). Note: Crews will not
use the word “clear” or “clearance” when requesting aircraft tows. The recommended
phraseology will be “REQUEST TOW APPROVAL FROM (location) TO (location).”
   1.15.1. 403d MOC and maintenance personnel shall notify the Control Tower via an
   appropriate direct dial line of a required tow of an aircraft in a specific spot, or requirement
   to move a specific aircraft from one location to another. If the notification is made through
   AMOPS, AMOPS will pass all information to the Tower and 81 SFS Base Defense
   Operations Center (BDOC).
   1.15.2. Final authority to postpone or discontinue towing operations rests with the Tower
   based on aircraft ground movements, coordination, anti-hijack procedures or safety.
   1.15.3. During times when the Tower is closed/unmanned, the MOC shall notify the 81
   TRW/CP of all aircraft tows with termination time.
1.16. Aircraft Taxiing Requirements/Routes. Taxiway Echo is 50-feet wide. Only small-
frame aircraft may utilize Echo IAW UFC 3-260-01.
   1.16.1. Aircraft with wingspans of 132’ and larger will not taxi behind C-130s parked on
   Spots 1 – 14. Aircraft with a wing span of 130’ or less may taxi behind Spots 1-14 during
   day to day ops, pending there are no large/heavy (i.e. C-17 or larger) aircraft parked on these
   spots (i.e. for contingency operations). If aircraft 124’ or larger are parked on Spot 16 or 30,
   a wing walker will be required. For special events (i.e. contingencies, air show/open houses),
   aircraft taxi routes will be closely coordinated between Airfield Management, Tower, to
   ensure appropriate wingtip clearances.
   1.16.2. Large/heavy-frame aircraft (i.e., C-17, C-5) will not taxi behind aircraft parked on
   Spots 1 - 14 without a wing walker. If a C-130 is parked on Spot 30, the large/heavy-frame
   aircraft (i.e., C-17, C-5) will require a wing walker to taxi past Spot 30 on Taxiway Alpha.
   1.16.3. Aircraft with wingspans less than 110 feet may taxi in and out of the Backline
   pending there are no wingtip clearance issues with other parked aircraft (i.e. aircraft parked
   on Spot 29). Aircraft with wingspans greater than 110 feet require a wing walker on the
   Backline.
1.17. Airfield Maintenance Operations. In order to maintain Keesler’s airfield free of Foreign
Object Damage (FOD) certain procedures are to be observed.
   1.17.1. AMOPS will:
       1.17.1.1. Determine what areas on the airfield require sweeping and relay detailed
       information to the sweeper driver.
 14                                                        KEESLEAFBI13-201 16 April 2013


         1.17.1.2. Track those areas that have been or need to be swept. If outside normal duty
         hours, contact EMCS at 228-377-4179 for sweeper requirements.
         1.17.1.3. Ensure areas swept are annotated in the sweeper log book. Areas that need to
         be swept should be annotated on the Keesler Airfield Inspection Checklist
   1.17.2. CSC will:
         1.17.2.1. Send a sweeper to AM Ops every day at approximately 0700L to sweep the
         entire airfield unless otherwise directed by AMOPS.
         1.17.2.2. Expedite travel to AM Ops whenever a sweeper is requested. The sweeper
         should respond no later than 20 minutes. For after hour operations, the sweeper must
         report to the airfield as expeditiously as possible, but no longer than 1 hour after
         notification.
         1.17.2.3. The sweeper will not be equipped with a metal-bristled brush to prevent
         possible FOD from the bristles.
   1.17.3. Airfield Sweeping schedule:
         1.17.3.1. Monday through Friday 0700L to 1100L.
         1.17.3.2. On-call during weekends and compressed work schedule (CWS) Fridays.
         1.17.3.3. Not normally operational on federal holidays.
   1.17.4. Airfield mowers will cut the grass from 7” to 14” to conform with grass height
   standards in AFI 13-204v3 IC 1. Mowers usually operate from 0600L to 1600L on the
   airfield. The direction of mowing will be from the runway outward.
      1.17.5. AMOPS will work with CSC to remove trees and conduct tree surveys annually IAW
      AFI 13-204v3 IC 1. AMOPS will also coordinate with CSC to ensure trees/vegetation do not
      conflict with imaginary surfaces, primary surfaces and the frangibility zone or pose a
      potential hazard to air traffic. CSC will plan and budget to conduct these tree surveys and
      removal/control of trees and vegetation.
   1.17.6. CSC will plan and budget to remove rubber build-up on the runway annually. CSC
   will also plan to re-paint the airfield IAW AFI 32-1042, Standards for Marking Airfields,
   ETL 04-2 Change 1, Standard Airfield Pavement Marking Schemes, and the following table
   or as needed:

TABLE 1.5. STANDARDS FOR MARKING AIRFIELDS
              Airfield Area to be Re-painted          Time Schedule
              Runway                                  Annually
              Restricted area markings                Annually
              Taxiways                                Every 2 years
              Parking aprons/taxi lanes               Every 2 years
              Vehicle driving lane                    Every 2 years
              FOD check point & stop signs            Every 2 years
1.18. Runway Surface Condition Determination. The Airfield Manager (AFM) or designated
representative is responsible for runway inspections during inclement weather or rapidly
KEESLEAFBI13-201 16 April 2013                                                                15


deteriorating weather (rain showers in the vicinity of the airfield or thunderstorms within 10
NM). Surface conditions will be identified as “wet” or “dry”. Runway Condition Reading
(RCR) values are not available at Keesler. If standing water is present on the runway, it will be
reported to within 1/10 of an inch. A scattered water reading should be expected due to the
grooving of the runway. Runway Surface Condition will not be reported when the airfield is
closed.
   1.18.1. AMOPS will notify the Tower, 81 TRW/CP, 815 AS, 53 WRS, 345 AS of RSC
   changes. The Tower will notify Gulfport Approach via landline and place the RSC of wet
   runway on the ATIS. AMOPS will transmit a NOTAM.
1.19. Procedures/Requirements for Conducting Runway Inspections/Checks. An airfield
inspection is required by AMOPS before the first aircraft landing/departure take-off each day
IAW AFI 13-204v3 IC 1. Airfield checks are required for Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard
(BASH), in-flight/ground emergencies, FOD, inspection of pavement conditions, runway
intrusions/CMA violations, construction areas, arrival/departure of heavy-frame aircraft, spot
inspections of airfield drivers, night time lighting checks and evaluation of runway surface
condition. AMOPS will conduct checks after the Steinhawk Drop Zone (DZ) has been utilized.
AMOPS will request permission from the Tower before accessing the CMA.
1.20. Engine Test/Run-up Procedures. 403d MOC will contact the Tower prior to aircraft
asking permission for an engine run/test or tow clearance. Following this coordination, aircraft
will contact Ground Control [Very High Frequency (VHF) 121.8 or Ultra High Frequency
(UHF) 275.8] prior to engine start. Crews will monitor Ground Control frequencies
continuously during maintenance engine runs. Crews will reduce power and shut down engines
when directed by the Tower. Use of the Ramp Net is permissible only as a last resort if
mechanical difficulties preclude the use of aircraft radios and after prior coordination with
AMOPS and the Tower. Note: Crews will not use the word “clear” or “clearance” when
requesting aircraft engine runs. The recommended phraseology will be “REQUEST ENGINE
RUN ON SPOT (location).”
   1.20.1. During published airfield closure hours, maintenance engine runs are normally not
   permitted unless mission-essential. 403d MOC will notify 81 TRW/CP of all after-hours
   engine runs to include termination time.
   1.20.2. Terminate all ground engine run operations immediately when lightning is within
   five nautical miles of the airfield. Do not resume operations until the warning is terminated.
   1.20.3. Wind conditions permitting, position C-130 and larger aircraft for pre-takeoff engine
   run-up so prop blast is deflected by blast fences to prevent damage to property or injury to
   personnel. Do not position aircraft where prop blast will cross the runway without prior
   approval from the Tower.
   1.20.4. The Tower will consider any engine start or taxi that has not been pre-coordinated as
   a potential hi-jacking situation and implement stop alert procedures IAW 81 TRW Plan 502,
   Anti-hijacking and Prevention of Unauthorized Aircraft Movement.
   1.20.5. The primary locations for maintenance engine runs (above ground idle) are Spots 1 -
   4, 17 – 19, 24 - 25, and 29.
   1.20.6. Spots 5 - 16, 20 - 23 and 30 may be used for ground idle runs only.
 16                                                         KEESLEAFBI13-201 16 April 2013


   1.20.7. 403d C-130s “motor’ aircraft engines while the aircraft is parked at the wash rack.
   “Motoring” the engines entails that the aircraft’s auxiliary power unit is started and the
   engine blades are allowed to gently turn without actually starting the engines. All “motor”
   operations shall be coordinated by the 403d MOC with the Tower before commencing and
   when the operation is complete. Additionally, MOC may require an engine run on Spot 30
   after an aircraft has utilized the wash rack. MOC will coordinate with Tower via two
   requests: (1) tow from the wash rack to Spot 30 and (2) engine run on Spot 30.
1.21. Noise Abatement. Pilots will avoid over-flying the USAF Medical Center (located on the
Back Bay approximately 1 mile East of the runway) and the VA Hospital (located 1 mile West of
the runway) also on the Back Bay. All complaints of aircraft noise or activity will be referred to
81 TRW/PA at 228-377-2783.
1.22. Protecting Precision Approach Critical Areas. Instrument hold lines are established to
protect the ILS Critical Area glide slope signal during inclement weather. When the reported
ceiling is less than 800 feet and/or visibility is less than 2 miles, all aircraft and vehicles must
hold at the instrument hold line on Foxtrot for Runway 21 when instructed by the Tower. When
weather dictates, the Tower will broadcast on the ATIS, “INSTRUMENT HOLD
PROCEDURES IN EFFECT.” The Tower will activate the Ploesti Drive traffic lights when
aircraft are 5 miles to fly to protect the Glide Slope Critical Area. The Tower will also comply
with procedures in JO 7110.65, Para 3-7-6. regarding protection of the Precision Obstacle Free
Zone (POFZ). Reference para 1.6.4.2. above for activation of the Ploesti Dr. Traffic Light.
   1.22.1. The Tower will not permit aircraft and vehicles past the instrument hold line area or
   in the Localizer Critical Area when an aircraft is 5-miles to fly on an ILS approach to
   Runway 21 whenever conditions are less than reported ceiling 800 feet and/or visibility less
   than 2 miles. See Keesler Instruction 13-213, Airfield Driving Instruction for vehicle traffic
   procedures, markings and signage on the airfield.
   1.22.2. Glide Slope Critical Area. The ILS (glide slope) Critical Area may not be protected
   due to vehicles near the marina. Figure 1.22.1 is a diagram of the Glide Slope Critical Area,
   Figure 1.22.2 is a depiction of the Localizer Critical Area and Figure 1.22.3 is a depiction of
   the POFZ. The Tower will restrict all vehicles and aircraft on the ground outside of the Glide
   Slope Critical Area and POFZ IAW Para 1.22.1. Tower will also reference A7.2.2.8 below
   in attachment 7.

1.23. Restricted/Classified Areas on the Airfield. When there is a Protection Level 3 aircraft
parked on Spots 1 - 14, 17 - 23, 28 – 29, Fuel-Cell Hangar, Wash Rack or anywhere on the
airfield, personnel must have a restricted area badge or be escorted by an individual with a
 18                                                     KEESLEAFBI13-201 16 April 2013


restricted area badge to enter restricted areas. There is no classified safe inside Airfield
Management Operations. 81 TRW/CP can store classified materials. Contact for 81 TRW/CP is
228-377-4330.
   1.23.1. Protection Level 3 or higher level aircraft parked in other than marked restricted
   areas shall have a cordon established around the aircraft (coordinate with BDOC). Aircraft
   that are not capable of flying within 72 hours do not require a cordon. Personnel
   entering/exiting the restricted areas must use the designated Entry Control Points (ECP).
1.24. Procedures for Suspending Runway Operations. The AFM or designated
representative is the lead authority to suspend runway operations. The Tower WS/SC may also
suspend runway operations for safety reasons (i.e. FOD on the runway).
   1.24.1. Runway operations are suspended when a heavy type aircraft (C-17) departs or lands
   at Keesler or after the arrival of an aircraft with an in flight emergency (IFE). AMOPS must
   conduct a FOD check of the runway after the aircraft has landed or departed. Runway
   operations may also be suspended for other aircraft frames such as a Boeing 757. Runway
   operations can only be resumed by the AFM or designated AMOPS representative.
1.25. Procedures for Opening and Closing the Runway. AMOPS will conduct an airfield
check before opening/closing the runway IAW AFI 13-204v3 IC 1 for airfield inspections and
checks.
   1.25.1. Opening: AMOPS will inform 81 TRW/CP and 81 SFS of opening, review
   NOTAMs with the Tower, perform opening airfield inspection checklist, obtain firefighting
   capability from the Fire Department, declare Bird Watch Condition with the Tower and
   notify the Tower and Weather of Runway Surface Condition. AMOPS will also call 81
   TRW/CP to obtain control of the CMA and vehicle/engine run information. AMOPS will
   give control of the CMA to the Tower when the Tower opens after AMOPS has completed
   their airfield inspection and will state on the Ramp Net that the Tower has control of the
   CMA. Note: For after-hours operations, see para 1.2. The Tower will withhold the
   aircraft’s clearance and engine start until they have control of the CMA and the flight plan
   from AMOPS.
       1.25.1.1. The Tower will obtain control of the CMA and information regarding vehicle
       operations and engine runs from AMOPS. The Tower will make a broadcast on all Local
       and Ground frequencies and the Ramp Net that the Tower is open and vehicles must
       contact the Tower for CMA access. The Tower will utilize checklists as posted in Flight
       Operating Instruction 13-1, Control Tower Management.
   1.25.2. Closing: AMOPS will inform 81 TRW/CP, Weather, 81 SFS and the Tower of
   airfield/runway closure. For runway closures due to conditions outside of normal closing,
   AMOPS will execute the appropriate QRC and coordinate/publish the appropriate NOTAM.
       1.25.2.1. The Tower will give control of the CMA to 81 TRW/CP and make a broadcast
       over all Local and Ground frequencies and Ramp Net that the Control Tower is closed
       IAW FOI 13-1.
   1.25.3. The 81 TRW/CC is the approval authority for airfield closures not exceeding 96
   hours. Airfield closures longer than 96 hours shall be forwarded to HQ AETC/A3OF NLT 30
   days prior to the requested closure date for HQ AETC/A3 approval.
KEESLEAFBI13-201 16 April 2013                                                                 19


1.26. Local Flying Area/Designation of Airspace. Keesler’s Airspace:                 The airspace
extending upwards from the surface to and including 2,500 MSL within a 4.2 mile radius of
Keesler AFB, excluding the portion west of longitude 89 degrees 00’00”W (see Attachment 3).
This Class D airspace may be effective during the specific dates and times established in advance
by a NOTAM IAW JO 7400.9, Airspace Designations and Reporting Points. The effective date
and time will thereafter be continuously published in the Airport/Facility Directory IAW JO
7400.9. When the Tower is closed, the airspace reverts to Class Echo. Keesler Tower delegates
2,000 feet MSL and above and airspace on and south of Gulfport 115 radial within Keesler’s
airspace to Gulfport Approach. Gulfport Tower has Class Delta airspace. Gulfport’s Airspace is
adjacent to Keesler’s, it has a 4.5 mile radius and extends from surface up to and including 2,500
feet MSL.
1.27. Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Local Training Areas. All local VFR training areas should
be coordinated with ATC. Functional check flights are referenced in the 403d Wing Instruction
21-101, Functional Check Flights/Local Procedures.

                                      VFR PROCEDURES

2.1. VFR Weather Minimums. The ceiling and visibility must be at or above 1,000 above
ground level (AGL) and 3 miles IAW JO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control.
2.2. VFR Traffic Patterns. Traffic Patterns. The conventional rectangular traffic pattern is
500 feet MSL for helicopters/light aircraft, 1,000 feet MSL for normal aircraft. (see Attachment
3). Right turns for Runway 21 and left turns for Runway 03. Tower controllers may adjust the
traffic pattern to accommodate different aircraft traffic scenarios (i.e., left turns/left break for
Runway 21 and right turns/right break for Runway 03). Note 1: Safety of flight takes
precedence over noise abatement procedures. Note 2: Helicopters may request a pattern altitude
of 1,000 feet MSL at night.
   2.2.1. Overhead Pattern. The overhead pattern is 1,500 feet MSL. The weather minimums
   are: ceiling must be 500 feet above the requested initial altitude and 3 miles visibility.
   2.2.2. Protection of the 360 Degree Overhead Pattern. If the overhead pattern is active,
   Tower will issue the phraseology “MAINTAIN AT OR BELOW 1,000 FEET UNTIL
   DEPARTURE END” in order to maintain at least 500 feet separation from overhead traffic
   patterns.
2.3. Special Procedures. Unmanned Aircraft Systems Operations are not utilized at Keesler.
Refer to AFI 13-204v3 IC 1, para 3.10 for the development of procedures should the requirement
arise.
   2.3.1. Helicopters. Helicopter traffic patterns will be as coordinated with the Tower.
   Requests to arrive/depart to/from other surfaces on the airfield will be handled on an
   individual basis IAW FAA Joint Order (JO) 7110.65. The established traffic pattern for
   helicopters is 500 feet MSL.
       2.3.1.1. Traffic permitting, Tower controllers may allow helicopters to take off and land
       on the CMA (i.e. Taxiway Alpha).
       2.3.1.2. Helicopter landings on Taxiway Alpha are more convenient for the aircrew in
       many scenarios. The Tower shall ensure helicopter operations on the CMA are de-
       conflicted with vehicular traffic.
       2.3.1.3. When possible all helicopters with wheeled landing gear will ground taxi
       to/from parking. Helicopter hover operations are not normally authorized at Keesler due
       to FOD concerns. If necessary, hover operations will be conducted over paved surfaces.
       The preferred method is air taxi.
   2.3.2. Flight Check. Observed or reported traffic considered in conflict with the flight check
   aircraft will be instructed by the Tower to hold or instructed to circle as appropriate until no
   conflict is assured. An advisory that a Flight Inspection is in progress shall be broadcast on
   the ATIS. Example: “FAA FLIGHT CHECK IN PROGRESS, EXPECT DELAYS.
   2.3.3. Paradrop Operations. The Steinhawk DZ is used for personnel drop training.
   AMOPS will ensure an appropriate NOTAM and airfield advisory is sent for DZ and
KEESLEAFBI13-201 16 April 2013                                                                    21


   parachute activities affecting the Keesler runway. Personnel drops are scheduled through
   AMOPS.
      2.3.3.1. The requesting agency will provide AMOPS with the following information no
      later than five working days prior to the proposed operations: date of jump/drop, type
      aircraft, call sign, aircraft organization, operational block time, altitude utilized for drop,
      number of passes/jumpers and USAF/FAA agencies contacted by user.
      2.3.3.2. AMOPS will notify 81 TRW/CP, Tower, 81 SFS, 403 OG Current Ops, Flight
      Service Station (FSS), Golf Course club house and 81 AMDS/CC (for ambulance
      support).
      2.3.3.3. The Tower will activate the Ploesti Drive traffic lights to stop vehicular traffic.
      2.3.3.4. Runway ops will be suspended during all drops.
      2.3.3.5. Only standard airdrop training bundles will be used. The drop altitude is 400
      feet -1,100 feet AGL and proposed airspeed is 130-140 Knots Indicated Air Speed
      (KIAS).
      2.3.3.6. The Tower will not allow vehicles/aircraft/personnel into the CMA.
2.4. Reduced Same Runway Separation Procedures (RSRS). Due to the short length of the
runway RSRS cannot be utilized at Keesler.
2.5. Intersection Departures. Intersection departures are authorized as indicated below.
Distances depict usable runway lengths from the intersection to the end of the runway.
Controllers will issue feet available to departing military aircraft (see Attachment 2).
   2.5.1. When a small plus/large/heavy aircraft utilizes the keyhole for departure, intersection
   wake turbulence separation of 3 minutes will be applied IAW JO 7110.65 if an aircraft of a
   lower weight class departs from Taxiway Foxtrot/Bravo after the aircraft of a larger weight
   class.
2.6. VFR Reporting/Holding Points. The VFR reporting points are: Ocean Springs Bridge to
the East and the Popps Ferry Bridge to the West. Other common VFR points are listed in the
chart below in relation to Keesler’s Runway 03/21.

TABLE 2.6. VFR Points

 VFR REPORTING POINTS             LOCATION                 VFR HOLDING POINTS
 City of Biloxi                   4 miles ESE              Beau Rivage (TIKI)
 Ocean Springs Bridge             5 miles E                Popps (POPPS) Ferry Bridge
 Edgewater Mall                   5 miles WSW
 Power Plant                      6 miles NW
   2.6.1. The Tower may utilize alternate holding/reporting points as deemed necessary (i.e.
   Imperial Palace) or distances from the field (2 miles West or East).
2.7. Tactical Arrivals (Random Steeps/Shallows). (See Attachments 4, 5 and 6 for diagrams
depicting Random Steeps/Shallows). Tactical departures not utilized at Keesler.
   2.7.1. Random Steep/Shallow Approaches: These maneuvers are considered non-standard
   and as such, are at the sole approval/disapproval of the Tower WS/SC. These maneuvers are
 22                                                          KEESLEAFBI13-201 16 April 2013


   only approved for base-assigned 403Wg C-130 aircraft unless approved by the 81 TRW/CV
   and may be flown from any cardinal direction (i.e., conducting random shallows from West
   to East) in VFR conditions. Note: Training of base-assigned aircraft takes priority over
   transient aircraft training.
   2.7.2. Practice Random Shallow Approaches: This low altitude approach is used primarily
   to avoid early warning radar or radar guided surface-to-air missiles near an airfield. The
   approach is random and therefore can be flown from any direction. The most common
   approaches are straight-in, teardrop, abeam and downwind. These approaches are flown no
   lower than 500 feet AGL.
   2.7.3. Practice Random Steep Approaches: This approach is used primarily to avoid small
   arms threat. The initial altitude, airspeed and heading are based on the threat range and
   location. The typical profile flown at Keesler will start at 4,500 feet MSL. The aircraft will
   lose half its altitude on the first turn to 2,500 feet MSL. At base turn, the aircraft altitude will
   be between 1,000 – 1,500 feet MSL. The aircraft will roll out on final no less 150 feet AGL.
   The entry for the random steep approach should be commenced from 4,500 feet MSL and
   140 KIAS. Note: Pilots will notify the Tower once they begin their descent from 4,500 feet
   MSL.
2.8. Keesler AFB Tactical/Formation Recoveries.
   2.8.1. Overhead Recovery: Aircrews will report a five-mile initial with the Tower for the
   overhead. Direction of the break will be as directed by the Tower. The entry for the
   overhead should be commenced from 1,500 feet MSL and 200 KIAS.
   2.8.2. Downwind Recovery: Establish radio contact with the Tower prior to entering the
   Class Delta airspace. Maneuver as approved by the Tower for the downwind. The entry for
   the downwind should be commenced from 1,000 feet MSL and 200 KIAS.
   2.8.3. Random Steep/Shallow Approaches: Coordinate with the Tower on the specific type
   of approach desired.
         2.8.3.1. Normally, random steep approaches are flown from 4,500 feet MSL and must be
         coordinated several minutes in advance by the Tower with Gulfport Approach.
         2.8.3.2. For day operations, initiate the random shallow approaches at 500 feet AGL.
         For night operations, aircrews will not initiate the approach at lower altitudes than the
         highest category circling minimums for the airfield in the FLIPs. Avoid over flight of the
         VA hospital and Keesler AFB hospital. Note: Aircrews shall comply with Federal
         Aviation Regulation (FAR) obstacle criteria during tactical approaches.
      2.8.4. Tiki Approach, Runway 03/21 (Random Shallow Abeam). Runway 03 takeoff, use an
      East turnout remaining over the bay and gulf with a continuous right turn until initiating the
      run-in, normally just South of the Beau Rivage. Remain within 5 nautical miles (NM) of
      Keesler to the East and 3 NM South unless previously coordinated with the Tower. Remain
      at or below 1,500 feet AGL.
      2.8.5. Runway 21 takeoff: Use an East turn out and then a left turn to reverse direction.
      Remain within 5 NM of Keesler to the East and 3 NM South unless previously coordinated
      with the Tower. Remain at or below 1,500 feet AGL.
         2.8.5.1. The flight crew will not delay the run-in without notifying the Tower.
KEESLEAFBI13-201 16 April 2013                                                                23


     2.8.5.2. The run-in will include an over-flight of the runway before the break. If the
     controller states “APPROVED AS REQUESTED” the aircrew can alter the flight path in
     any manner to include a break before the runway as long as the landing runway remains
     the same.
     2.8.5.3. If the Tower needs to issue a breakout, the controller will expect the aircraft to
     exit the pattern to the South unless otherwise instructed.
  2.8.6. Popps Approach, Runway 03/21 (Random Shallow Abeam):
     2.8.6.1. Approach from the West beginning around the Popps Ferry Bridge and
     remaining within 4 NM of Keesler.
     2.8.6.2. Runway 03 takeoff: Use a West turnout and then a left turn to reverse direction.
     2.8.6.3. Runway 21 takeoff, use a West turn out and then a right turn to reverse direction.
     The run-in will include an over-flight of the runway before the break. If the Tower states
     “APPROVED AS REQUESTED” the aircrew can alter the flight path in any manner to
     include a break before the runway as long as the landing runway remains the same.
     2.8.6.4. The flight crew will not delay the run-in without notifying the Tower. If the
     Tower needs to issue a breakout, the controller will expect the aircraft to exit the pattern
     to the South unless otherwise instructed.
  2.8.7. High-Speed Left/Right Downwind, Runway 03/21:
     2.8.7.1. Random Shallow approach from the North to land Runway 03 or South to land
     Runway 21. The run-in will establish the aircraft at the appropriate base turn point. The
     flight crew will not delay the run-in without notifying the Tower.
     2.8.7.2. If the Tower needs to issue a breakout, the controller will expect the aircraft to
     exit the pattern to the South unless otherwise instructed.
  2.8.8. High-Speed Straight-In, Runway 03/21:
     2.8.8.1. Remain within 5 NM of Keesler to the East and 3 NM South unless previously
     coordinated with the Tower. Remain at or below 1,500 feet AGL.
     2.8.8.2. The run-in will establish the aircraft on a 4 - 6 NM final before initiating the
     slowdown. Aircrews shall be advised that the setup for this approach may place the
     aircraft in airspace outside the jurisdiction of the Tower. The Tower shall coordinate
     with Gulfport Approach.
  2.8.9. Random Steep Approach, Runway 03/21 (usually 4,500 feet MSL):
     2.8.9.1. Remain within 4 NM of Keesler. If already under the Tower’s control, remain at
     or below 1,500 feet MSL until cleared for the approach while awaiting coordination
     between the Tower and Gulfport Approach.
     2.8.9.2. The run-in will establish the aircraft over or near the runway at approximately
     140 knots. The flight crew will not delay the run-in without notifying the Tower.
     2.8.9.3. The descent from altitude will be a spiral at approximately 140 knots. The
     descent will require one 360 degree turn per 4,000 feet of altitude to lose.
     2.8.9.4. Turn reversals are authorized as long as the landing runway remains the same.

  2.8.10. Tactical Approach Cut-off Points. Tactical approaches are not authorized when
  arrivals on an instrument approach are within 5 NM from the airfield. No more than 2
  sequenced tactical approaches will be permitted at one time. Note: IFR aircraft take priority
  over aircraft conducting practice VFR/tactical approaches.
KEESLEAFBI13-201 16 April 2013                                                                   25

                                      IFR PROCEDURES

3.1. Radar Traffic Patterns. No radar traffic patterns are published for Keesler AFB. Expect
radar vectors from Gulfport Approach. Successive instrument approaches to Keesler AFB may
be limited due to airspace conflicts with Gulfport airport. Aircraft requesting multiple
instrument approaches to Keesler AFB should make their request with Gulfport Approach.
3.2. Availability for Surveillance and Precision Approach                         Radar     (PAR)
Approaches. Surveillance and PAR approaches are not available at Keesler.
3.3. Multiple Approach/Local Departure Procedures. For Runway 03/21, after completing a
low approach, missed approach or touch-and-go, all aircraft will fly runway heading maintain at
or below 1,000 feet until departure end of runway, then climb and maintain 2,000 feet to protect
the 360-degree overhead pattern.
   3.3.1. The standard climb-out is addressed in Keesler AFB Instruction 13-201, Page 38, Para
   6.13. IAW AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules, Chapter 8, an aircraft on an IFR flight plan
   may cancel IFR and remain VFR as long as the aircraft remains under control of Keesler
   Tower. If the aircraft then wants to depart Keesler Tower’s jurisdiction after this time (i.e. to
   depart Keesler for Stennis or be vectored for an instrument approach by Gulfport), the pilot
   will contact AMOPS via any means necessary to amend the flight plan (i.e. telephone, Pilot-
   to-Dispatch) before departing Keesler Tower’s airspace.
3.4. Radar Vectors to Initial Procedures. Gulfport Approach will vector aircraft requesting
radar vectors to initial no closer than 5 NM from the runway and will transfer radio
communications before the aircraft enters Keesler’s Class Delta.

                                            Chapter 4

                                EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

4.1. Operation of the Primary and Secondary Crash Net. The Tower activates the Primary
Crash Alarm System (PCAS) for initial notification of emergencies, incidents, mishaps and/or
exercises pertaining to aircraft or the airfield environment. Additionally, any pertinent follow-up
information received by the Tower should be relayed via the PCAS. AMOPS will then activate
the Secondary Crash Net (SCN) after each activation of the PCAS.
   4.1.1. PCAS Activation. Agencies listed on the PCAS will respond immediately upon
   activation of the crash phone. Normally, the Tower will not transmit emergency information
   until the phone’s monitor indicates all agencies are on the line. AMOPS is required to keep a
   copy of AETC Form 745, Emergency/Accident and Hazardous Cargo Log, for each
   emergency.
   4.1.2. PCAS Agencies. The following agencies are included on the PCAS:                  Tower,
   AMOPS, Base Fire/Crash Station, Emergency Room and Flight Surgeon.
   4.1.3. Operational Checks. The Tower will make an operational check of the PCAS before
   the airfield is open (between 0800L -- 0815L Mon - Fri and between 1100L -- 1115L Sat –
   Sun and UTA). During the check, each individual responding for an agency will respond
   with clarity, their initials and remain on the line until released by the Tower. AMOPS will
   make a similar check of the SCN after the PCAS daily operational check. All agencies will
   report crash net problems to the Telephone Trouble Section at 377-2130. No additions,
   deletions or changes are made to the PCAS/SCN without prior coordination or approval by
   the 81 OSF/CC.
       4.1.3.1. The Keesler Alert Net (KAN) will be used as a backup to the SCN or emergency
       contact numbers listed on AETC Form 745 located inside AMOPS. In the event the SCN
       is unusable or unavailable, pass all pertinent data to 81 TRW/CP. 81 TRW/CP will, in
       turn, notify the affected agencies using the KAN. AMOPS will test the SCN backup
       procedures at least quarterly IAW AFI 13-204v3 IC 1. Notify SCN agencies by
       telephone. Annotate the SCN backup check on AF IMT 3616.
   4.1.4. Crash Net Discipline. All agencies listening on both the PCAS/SCN will remain
   silent until all information has been passed. Hold questions until the initial message has been
   transmitted and a roll call of all agencies is complete. Telephone discipline is imperative on
   these nets. All agencies having talk capability on the PCAS/SCN will use push-to-talk
   handsets and should locate them at the agency control center. All parties must remain on the
   line until the Tower or AMOPS advises “SECURE THE NET.”
   4.1.5. Activation of PCAS. The Tower will activate the PCAS:
       4.1.5.1. When there is an IFE inbound to Keesler.
       4.1.5.2. An aircraft incident/accident occurs on the airfield or near the airfield as
       observed by the Tower.
       4.1.5.3. An emergency is declared by a pilot or maintenance personnel in an aircraft on
       the ramp/parking area (i.e., hot brakes).
KEESLEAFBI13-201 16 April 2013                                                                  27


       4.1.5.4. Unauthorized movement of aircraft is observed or suspected.
       4.1.5.5. During a suspected hijack of an aircraft arriving or departing Keesler (refer to
       81 TRW Plan 502, Anti-hijacking and Prevention of Unauthorized Aircraft Movement).
       4.1.5.6. A bomb threat is received or when information is received that a bomb may have
       been placed on aircraft or surrounding areas.
       4.1.5.7. As requested by an aircraft pilot or personnel responsible for the aircraft, Duty
       Officer, AMOPS, 81 TRW/CP, Fire Department or the Tower WS/SC.
       4.1.5.8. As required to support base exercises pertaining to the airfield and aircraft
       emergencies.
   4.1.6. SCN Activation. The SCN is activated by AMOPS to immediately relay information
   received from the PCAS. In addition, the SCN will be activated when a ground
   incident/accident occurs on or near the airfield. The SCN shall be used to relay all pertinent
   information such as accident location, safe route, entry control point etc. Additionally, the
   SCN will be activated as needed during base exercises involving aircraft or the airfield
   environment.
   4.1.7. SCN Agencies. The following agencies are included on the SCN: Base Fire
   Department, Emergency Room, CSC Readiness/Disaster Preparedness, CSC CE, 81
   TRW/CP, Weather, 81 MSG/CC, 81 SFS, 81 TRW/PA, 403d MOC, 81 TRW/SEF, 53 WRS
   Duty Officer and Flight Medicine.
   4.1.8. SCN Activation. In the event AMOPS receives ground emergency information by
   landline or telephone, AMOPS will activate the SCN. All primary agencies are on the SCN
   with the exception of the Tower. AMOPS will subsequently notify the Tower of the
   emergency situation.
4.2. Emergency Response Procedures. Aircrews are primarily responsible for declaring
ground or IFEs. An IFE may also be declared by ATC or officials responsible for the operation
of the aircraft. Aircraft shall point the nose into the wind. The Incident Commander (IC) will
establish a cordon as situation/size up requires. Cordon normally 75 feet upwind, 200 feet
downwind for aircraft with engines running. IAW NFPA Standard 1500; section 8.5.18 during
aircraft incident; the initial IDLH (Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health) zone will be set at
75 feet from skin of aircraft. After size up; IDLH will be adjusted by IC as situation dictates.
Note: For hydrazine incidents, the Tower will activate the PCAS and direct the aircraft to
Taxiway Foxtrot.
   4.2.1. Any individual who becomes aware of aircraft emergency situations (on or off base)
   will use any means available to relay the necessary information to any agency capable of
   initiating emergency procedures (the Tower, Duty Officer, Fire Department, 81 TRW/CP,
   AMOPS, etc.).
   4.2.2. When a landing emergency aircraft is 10 miles to fly, no aircraft will be allowed to
   land, taxi or towed. The Tower will activate the Ploesti Drive traffic lights to stop vehicular
   traffic at the North end of the airfield. The Tower will also actiate the bailout alarm to alert
   personnel working in the glide slope shelter located in close proximity to the runway of an
   inbound emergency aircraft that may present a potential hazard to personnel at the glideslope.
 28                                                       KEESLEAFBI13-201 16 April 2013


   4.2.3. Runway operations will be suspended once the emergency aircraft passes the landing
   threshold. Runway closure, if necessary, is at the discretion of AMOPS. After runway
   operations have been suspended, the Tower releases the runway to the Senior Fire Officer
   (SFO) if the aircraft remains on the runway or the runway side of the VFR hold line at one of
   the taxiways.
   4.2.4. All emergency response vehicles will stage on the ramps or taxiways as applicable and
   await the arrival of the landing aircraft or approach the aircraft already on the ground. The
   Fire Department shall obtain approval from the Control Tower prior to entering the CMA and
   make an assessment of the situation and take appropriate measures.
       4.2.4.1. Additional vehicles (i.e. Security Forces or Ambulance) shall not enter the CMA
       or runway environment unless asked for by the Incident Scene Commander for support
       purposes and only after receiving approval from the Tower. These vehicles will hold
       short of the CMA on the ramp. Emergency response vehicles shall ensure they have
       approval from the Tower prior to entering the CMA and not assume they have approval,
       which would lead to a CMA violation or a possible runway incursion.
       4.2.4.2. Some scenarios may require Fire Department vehicles to drive over restricted
       area lines without using established entry control points.
   4.2.5. Upon termination of any emergency by the SFO, AMOPS will make a check of the
   runway for FOD or pavement discrepancies/failures. After the runway check is complete,
   AMOPS is the final authority for resuming/reopening normal operations.
   4.2.6. No aircraft will be cleared to land prior to inspecting the runway except by direction
   of AMOPS.
   4.2.7. Persons declaring emergencies (ground or in-flight) should provide the following
   information: aircraft identification and type, nature of emergency, pilot’s desires/intentions
   and fuel remaining in time. Any additional information will be obtained if time/situation
   permits.
   4.2.8. Ultimately, emergency information must be passed to the Tower to activate the PCAS.
   If unable to contact the Tower, notify AMOPS who will activate the SCN. AMOPS will then
   notify the Tower by landline.
   4.2.9. The Tower will silence the bailout alarm and deactivate the Ploesti Drive traffic light
   after the aircraft lands and no longer poses a hazard to personnel at the glideslope shelter.
   Personnel working at this shelter will be notified when the emergency is terminated.
   4.2.10. The following are agencies that utilize emergency vehicles: AMOPS, Safety, 81 SFS,
   Crash/Rescue and ambulance equipment (when their duties require deviation from normal
   operations). All vehicles will yield the right of way to emergency vehicles responding to an
   emergency.
4.3. Fuel Dump and External Stores Jettison Area Procedures. Aircraft requiring fuel
dumps, fuel tank drops or jettison areas will be directed to Keesler’s designated jettison area.
This area is located between the 228 and 235 radial from 48 Distance Measuring Equipment
(DME) to 68 DME off the Brookley VORTAC from 3,000 feet MSL up to, but not including
flight level 180.
KEESLEAFBI13-201 16 April 2013                                                                   29


   4.3.1. Aircraft operating IFR/VFR will notify the Tower of an emergency situation requiring
   fuel dump or jettison. The Tower will provide an approach control frequency to the aircraft
   for vectors to the fuel dump/jettison area by Gulfport Approach.
4.4. Emergency Arresting/Barrier Gear Procedures. Keesler does not have arresting gear or
barriers on the airfield; therefore no procedures are in place (see Keesler AFB Instruction 13-201
Para 1.8 regarding fighter-type aircraft).
4.5. Hot Brake Area and Procedures. The hot brake area is the Northern-most portion of the
run-up area at Spot 25. Spot 24 is also utilized for hot brakes for aircraft landing Runway 21
(see Attachment 2). The Tower will activate the PCAS when an aircraft reports hot brakes.
   4.5.1. Aircraft with suspected hot brakes should, if able, exit at the end of the runway. The
   SFO is responsible for all fire fighting and brake cooling actions. Warning: Brakes reach
   their highest temperature approximately 15 minutes (20-30 minutes for C-130 aircraft) after
   maximum braking. A 300-foot cordon is established and maintained until the SFO has
   declared the area safe.
4.6. Abandonment of Aircraft. The designated bailout area is three miles or more North of the
Keesler TACAN heading 360. Flight crews may also abandon aircraft on heading 180, three
miles or more South of Keesler TACAN over the water.
   4.6.1. After receiving the location of the abandoned aircraft from the Fire Department or
   other designated agency, the Tower and AMOPS will plot and broadcast aircraft coordinates
   over the PCAS and SCN and implement Crisis Action Team checklist E-2.
4.7. Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) Signals. An ELT signal may be tested during the
first five minutes of each hour and limited to three audio sweeps for ground maintenance testing
of equipment. Aircrews or maintenance personnel requiring a test of the ELT at other times will
coordinate with the Tower or AMOPS prior to the test. The Tower WS/SC is the final approving
authority for such tests. An individual accidentally activating an ELT will immediately report
the incident to the Tower.
   4.7.1. If the Tower hears an ELT signal that hasn’t been pre-coordinated, Tower will contact
   Gulfport to verify if they are also receiving the signal. If still receiving the alarm, the Tower
   will immediately report all information to AMOPS. AMOPS will then take action IAW their
   applicable Quick Reaction Checklist (QRC).
4.8. Hung Ordnance/Hot Guns/Hung Flare Procedures. The only hung ordnance procedures
in place at Keesler entail that aircraft are not authorized to land at Keesler unless under
emergency conditions or as approved by the 81 TRW/CV. Do not allow aircraft with hot
guns/munitions to face in the direction of housing or occupied areas until the weapon has been
secured by the aircraft commander. After such time, the aircraft will be parked on Spot 25
heading 360. The aircraft commander is ultimately responsible for securing the weapons
systems. Aircrews will conduct a flare check in the hot brake area immediately after clearing the
runway following a mission in which flares were expended. If a hung flare(s) (partial ejection) is
detected, the aircrew will notify Command Post that munitions/EOD support is required and shut
down the aircraft in the hot brake area. The aircraft will remain in the hot brake area until EOD
personnel can remove the hung flare(s). AMOPS will send a NOTAM closing that area when
the hung flare aircraft has arrived and parked.

4.9. Tower Evacuation/Wind Limitation. The Tower will be evacuated when personnel are
endangered by fire or electrical hazards, bomb threats, severe weather, when directed by the SFO
or any other situation/condition deemed necessary by the Tower WS/SC.
   4.9.1. The Tower will give control of the airspace to Gulfport, and the Class Delta will revert
   to a Class Echo under control of Gulfport Approach.
   4.9.2. High wind limitations have been set at 50 knots (steady or gust) for the Tower. The
   primary concern during high wind conditions is the threat of flying glass and debris.
4.10. Evacuation Tasks. Prior to leaving the Tower, controllers will activate the PCAS stating
“KEESLER TOWER IS EVACUATING TO (location) DUE TO (condition), CONTACT
AMOPS FOR UPDATES”.
   4.10.1. Notify Gulfport Approach of evacuation and the reasons why.
   4.10.2. Broadcast on all assigned ATC frequencies that the Tower will be evacuated and to
   notify aircrews to contact Gulfport Approach for clearances to land at Gulfport (if required).
   4.10.3. Broadcast via the ATIS “KEESLER TOWER HAS EVACUATED DUE TO
   (conditions), CONTACT GULFPORT APPROACH OR KEESLER PILOT-TO-DISPATCH
   FOR UPDATES.”
   4.10.4. Turn off all airfield lighting (if necessary).
   4.10.5. Tower personnel will evacuate the entire facility and determine the safest method to
   evacuate.
   4.10.6. AMOPS will activate the SCN and announce that the Tower is evacuating and the
   Tower’s intentions.
   4.10.7. Format, transmit and circulate NOTAM/airfield advisories to: 81 TRW/CP, 403d
   MOC, Fire Department, Central Security Control. AMOPS will forward NOTAMs and
   airfield advisories to the evacuation location via landline.
   4.10.8. In the event of an evacuation from the Base Operations building, AMOPS will
   activate the SCN and notify all parties on the net including the Flight Service Station and
   evacuate to Hangar 4, building 4204, room 210 (41st Aerial Port Squadron).
4.11. Evacuation Plan/Alternate Tower/AMOPS Facility. The Tower stairs should be the
primary method for evacuation. The Tower will evacuate to AMOPS as the primary evacuation
site. If AMOPS has also evacuated, the Tower will evacuate with AMOPS (if required).
   4.11.1. If Tower personnel are unable to utilize the stairs, the Baker Life Chute will be
   deployed and tied down to a vehicle at ground level. In case of high winds, evacuate all
   personnel to any floor in the tower without windows.
   4.11.2. AFI 13-204v3 IC 1 discusses the requirements to establish an alternate ATC facility.
   Currently, there is no designated alternate tower facility to sustain ATC operations at
   Keesler. In the event of unexpected emergency conditions, 81 TRW/CV or designated
   representative determines if there is a need to sustain ATC services. If ATC operations are
   conducted outside of the Tower (i.e. Contingency Operations etc.), the 81 OSF/CC will
   coordinate with HQ AETC/A3OF (see attachment 9).
KEESLEAFBI13-201 16 April 2013                                                                  31


4.12. Facility Re-entry. Resume Tower operations as directed by the 81 OSF/CC or Tower
CCTLR after it has been determined that it is safe to re-enter. The Tower pre-duty checklist will
be re-accomplished.
   4.12.1. Advise AMOPS to cancel published NOTAMs regarding the closed airfield. Notify
   appropriate agencies and/or individuals that Keesler Tower has returned to service.
4.13. Aircraft Recall Procedures. The 403rd/53rd Squadron Duty Officer(s) or 81 TRW/CP
will advise the Tower when either a weather or operational recall of airborne aircraft is required.
The Tower will transmit on all available frequencies “ATTENTION ALL KEESLER
AIRCRAFT, KEESLER TOWER ON GUARD THIS IS A RECALL.” The transmission will be
repeated two times and again one minute after the initial call.
4.14. Stop Alert Procedures. Aircraft which land or move at Keesler without clearance will be
handled IAW Stop Alert Procedures. Tower will activate the PCAS IAW 81 TRW Plan 502. At
no time will the aircraft be allowed to taxi onto Taxiway Alpha from the runway. Any
movement of the aircraft from the runway/taxiways will be handled by MX tow crew personnel.
Further movement of the aircraft will be at the discretion of the 81 TRW/CV or designated
representative.
   4.14.1. A Stop Alert will be initiated on unauthorized aircraft taxi movements, observed
   engine runs without clearance/coordination and/or when a departure authorization cannot be
   immediately established or verified with the Tower. Note: A flight progress strip that
   arrives via the FDIO does not provide authorization for an aircraft to arrive or depart Keesler.
   Controllers shall pre-coordinate with AMOPS to confirm the aircraft is approved to land or
   depart before the aircraft is given departure or arrival instructions.
4.15. Hijack Prevention and Response Procedures. Refer to 81 TRW Plan 502, Anti-
hijacking and Prevention of Unauthorized Aircraft Movement.
4.16. Actions Following an Aircraft Mishap. The 81 OSF/CC will coordinate on base mishap
notification procedures to ensure appropriate base agencies and senior leadership is notified of a
mishap in a timely manner. To ensure ATC facilities are appropriately focused on mishap
response activities and control of aircraft, only notification procedures directly associated with
timely relay of data and mishap response activities should be designated to controllers in ATC
facilities IAW AFI 13-204v3 IC 1 and 81 TRW Plan 91-204, Aircraft Mishap Response Plan.
Tower and AMOPS will implement Crisis Action Team Checklist E-1 or E-2. Note: Do not
release the names of personnel involved in an aircraft mishap. All inquiries from non-mishap

6.2. NOTAM Procedures. AMOPS is the issuing facility for NOTAMs and the Tower is the
primary NOTAM monitor facility. However, internet access is the primary source for NOTAMs.
Pilots may access NOTAMs at https://www.notams.jcs.mil/ or by calling Greenwood
Automated FSS at 1-800-352-3093. AMOPS will notify local flying agencies whenever there is
a change to local NOTAMs.
6.3. Flight Information Publication Accounts (FLIP)/Requesting Changes, Flight
Plans. The flight planning room inside Base Operations is the primary location for FLIP
materials. All requests for non-procedural changes should be made through the AFM.
Procedural changes should be coordinated through the 81 OSF/CC with the TERPS Specialist.
   6.3.1. Flight Plans. Aircrews will present all IFR/VFR flight plans filed on DD Form l75 to
   AMOPS not later than 30 minutes prior to takeoff. If departure time is critical, submit flight
   plan 60 minutes prior to departure. All flight plans filed on DD Form 1801, Department of
   Defense (DOD) International Flight Plan, must be submitted to AMOPS a minimum of 2
   hours prior to proposed takeoff time for entry into the ATC system (General Planning).
6.4. Waivers to Airspace/Airfield Criteria. HQ AETC/CV is the approval authority for all
airspace/airfield waivers unless delegated to MAJCOM or other authority. All waivers to airfield
criteria should be coordinated through CSC, AM, 81 TRW/SE and endorsed by the installation
commander prior to submittal to MAJCOM and approved before construction begins.
6.5. Prior Permission Required (PPR) Procedures. A valid PPR is required for all transient
aircraft. Aircrews should contact AMOPS at 228-377-2120 for PPRs.
6.6. Arriving Air Evac Notification and Response Procedures. During emergencies, aircraft
will be parked at Spot 16. Prior coordination is required with 81 TRW/CP and AMOPS.
6.7. Unscheduled Aircraft Arrivals. The Tower will relay information regarding unscheduled
aircraft arrivals to AMOPS as soon as possible after notification of the inbound aircraft. The
following information will be passed to AMOPS by the Tower: (1) The aircraft’s departure
station, (2) Aircraft call sign, (3) Type aircraft and (4) Pilot’s intentions. For further information,
the Tower will have the aircraft contact AMOPS via PTD on 372.2 if UHF-equipped. Note: A
flight progress strip that arrives via the FDIO does not provide authorization for an aircraft to
arrive at Keesler. Controllers shall pre-coordinate with AMOPS to confirm the aircraft is
approved to land before the aircraft arrives.
   6.7.1. AMOPS will use the Aeronautical Information System (AIS) computer and the
   Defense Switched Network (DSN) circuit to determine the reason why the aircraft is arriving
   unannounced and take actions to correct the situation.
   6.7.2. If the Tower or AMOPS cannot confirm the inbound aircraft, the Tower will be
   advised to initiate the Stop Alert procedures checklist (refer to 81 TRW Plan 502).
6.8. Distinguished Visitor (DV) Arrivals/Departures. AMOPS will advise the Tower of the
call sign and aircraft type of all aircraft carrying DVs to/from Keesler AFB. AMOPS will
request a 15-mile inbound call and will notify 81 TRW/CP and Protocol of estimated arrival
times after the applicable information is received from the Tower.
   6.8.1. The Tower will provide AMOPS with a 15-mile inbound notification of aircraft
   carrying DVs. This duty is secondary to providing ATC services and will be accomplished
   workload permitting.
 36                                                          KEESLEAFBI13-201 16 April 2013


   6.8.2. In the event that the Digital Brite Radar Indicator Tower Equipment (DBRITE) radar
   screen is inoperative, Tower controllers will provide an inbound call to AMOPS after initial
   contact has been made with the Tower by the aircrew or after Gulfport Approach has
   initiated a handoff.
6.9. Dangerous/Hazardous Cargo. Spot 25 is the dangerous/hazardous cargo parking location.
      6.9.1. Taxiway Foxtrot and the portion of Taxiway Alpha from Taxiway Echo to Foxtrot
      will be closed to all taxiing aircraft when aircraft are on/off loading cargo in the designated
      hot cargo area.
   6.9.2. Notification of inbound aircraft carrying hazardous cargo must be received by
   AMOPS and approved by Ground Safety. AFJI 11-204, Operational Procedures for Aircraft
   Carrying Hazardous Materials, requires aircraft carrying hazardous cargo or inert devices to
   indicate type cargo in the remark section of the DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan. A base
   agency receiving information on an inbound aircraft carrying hazardous cargo will relay all
   available information to AMOPS. AMOPS will notify 81 TRW/SEG Ground Safety.
6.10. Wear of Hats on the Airfield. The only exception to wearing of hats on the airfield is for
military protocol (arrivals and departures of DVs), maintenance personnel or Security Forces
operating on the airfield. 81 SFS will remove and secure their headgear anytime an aircraft is
running engines within 200 feet. Hats with metal snaps or fasteners will not be worn.
   6.10.1. It is recommended that pin-on rank not be worn on the airfield.              If personnel
   regularly work on the airfield, they should use sewn-on or cloth rank.
6.11. Local Aircraft Priorities. ATC services will be prioritized accordingly. Priorities listed
in JO 7110.65 supersede local aircraft priorities. IFR aircraft have priority over SVFR aircraft.
6.12. Lost Communication Instructions. Aircraft in the VFR overhead traffic pattern will fly
at 1,500 feet MSL to the active runway and rock wings while at initial. Aircraft will break at the
approach end of the runway. The Tower will issue appropriate light gun signals as the aircraft
turns base leg to final. Aircraft in the rectangular pattern will fly at 1,000 feet MSL to the active
runway and rock wings during daylight hours. At night, aircraft will flash navigation and
landing lights.
6.13. Standard Climb-Out Instructions. ATC will issue all departing aircraft “FLY
RUNWAY HEADING MAINTAIN 2,000” to aircraft conducting initial climb-out departures.
6.14. Opposite Direction Takeoffs and Landings. Opposite direction runway operations are
approved when an operational necessity exists. These procedures apply to both IFR and VFR
aircraft. Opposite direction arrivals will not be allowed when there is another arriving aircraft
within 7 miles from the threshold. Use the following criteria for opposite direction operations:
   6.14.1. Arrival vs. Arrival - The succeeding aircraft will be no closer than 7-mile final when
   the preceding full stop aircraft is over the landing threshold.
   6.14.2. Departure/Low Approach vs. Arrival - The departing/low approach aircraft must be
   airborne and turned to avert conflict prior to the arriving aircraft reaching a point no closer
   than 7-mile final.
   6.14.3. Opposite direction traffic involving VFR aircraft - Aircraft in the VFR traffic pattern
   will not be allowed to turn base leg until the IFR/VFR aircraft is airborne and beyond the
KEESLEAFBI13-201 16 April 2013                                                                  37


   VFR pattern base leg, or is not a conflict for the aircraft conducting an opposite direction
   approach. The 7-mile cut-off does not apply to VFR vs. VFR traffic.
6.15. Breakout/Go-Around/Missed Approach Procedures.
   6.15.1. Breakout/Go-Around Procedures. Breakout/Go-around instructions will be as issued
   by Gulfport Approach or the Tower.
   6.15.2. Missed Approach Procedures. Aircrews will fly the published missed approach
   procedures as depicted in the FLIPs or as published in a NOTAM.
6.16. Airfield Smoking Policy. Smoking is prohibited in vehicles or on the airfield except in
the following designated smoking areas: Note: Cigarettes will be placed in the smoking can
located in the designated smoking areas. Smoking is strictly prohibited near aircraft.
   6.16.1. East corner of Building 2403 (Hangar 3) adjacent to fire lane, Fire Department South
   corner bldg, adjacent to Bldg 0222 airfield side, South side of Roberts Facility, Base
   Operations Bldg 0233 airfield side behind Base Weather.
6.17. Civilian Aircraft Operations. In order for a civilian aircraft to land at a military airfield
the AFM must approve a civil aircraft landing permit IAW AFI 10-1001, Civil Aircraft Landing
Permits. AFI 10-1001 Para 3 discusses exempt aircraft. Exemptions are addressed in AFI 10-
1001.
6.18. Civil Use of Military NAVAIDS. The Tower will authorize landings at Keesler for only
those civil aircraft that have been verified/approved by AMOPS.
   6.18.1. With the Tower’s approval, civil aircraft without civil landing permits may use
   Keesler’s NAVAIDS and make practice visual and instrument approaches terminating in low
   or missed approaches only. Civil aircraft must not conduct touch-and-go or stop-and-go
   approaches.
6.19. Aero Club Operations. Keesler does not have an Aero Club.
6.20. Weather Dissemination and Coordination Procedures. The primary method for
disseminating weather to aircrews, the Tower, AMOPS and 81 TRW/CP is the Joint
Environmental Toolkit. AMOPS will ring out the SCN when severe weather is forecasted for
Keesler (i.e. tornadoes).
   6.20.1. When lightning is detected within 5 NM of Keesler, normal airfield activities will
   cease. This includes fueling/de-fueling and loading/unloading operations. Weather will
   issue a warning when lightning is observed within 5 NM of the runway complex IAW
   KAFBI 15-101, Weather Support. This warning will remain in effect until all lightning
   activity has moved outside 5 NM and the forecaster determines the immediate threat of
   lightning no longer exists within 5 NM. When a lightning warning is issued, all personnel
   should seek shelter. While aircraft and vehicles offer some protection, hard shelters are best.
   Aircraft operations may continue at pilot’s discretion.
   6.20.2. When a lightning warning is issued and terminated, the Tower will make an advisory
   on all Local, Ground and FM Ramp Net frequencies and place on the ATIS.
6.21. Airfield Snow Removal Operations. Keesler does not have the capability to
accommodate airfield snow removal operations.

6.22. Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Procedures. 81 TRW Flight Safety is
the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for the local BASH program IAW 81 TRW PLAN
212, Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH). Specific responsibilities and guidelines for tasked
organizations are outlined in this OPLAN.
6.23. Bird Watch Conditions (BWC). The Tower will deny any type of practice approach or
low-level approach during BWC Moderate and Severe.
   6.23.1. BWC SEVERE - All flight operations will cease under BWC SEVERE. Runway
   operations will be temporarily suspended and no take-offs, landings or transition training will
   be permitted under BWC SEVERE, with the exceptions of approved higher headquarter
   directed operational missions and in-flight emergencies. If necessity dictates and after the
   aircraft commander has made a thorough risk assessment of the bird condition, flight
   operations under BWC SEVERE can be authorized by requesting aircraft's unit OG/CC or
   higher authority. Take-offs under BWC SEVERE will use aircraft specific noise abatement
   climb procedures to lessen exposure to the bird strike risk and recoveries will use a straight-
   in approach to a full stop landing with all exterior aircraft lighting illuminated.
   6.23.2. BWC MODERATE - Concentrations of birds observed in locations that represent a
   probable hazard to safe flying operations. This condition requires increased vigilance by all
   agencies and extreme caution by aircrews. Only takeoffs and landings are authorized during
   BWC moderate. Multiple approaches are not authorized. Aircraft commanders will assess
   the risk of increased potential for bird strike and take appropriate precautions.
   6.23.3. BWC LOW - Normal bird activity on or above the airfield with a low probability of
   hazard to aircraft.
   6.23.4. The authority to declare a BWC is vested with the AFM or designated AMOPS
   representative. AMOPS can declare these conditions based on ground or Tower
   observations, pilot reports etc. Upon issuing a BWC, AMOPS personnel have the
   responsibility of maintaining, upgrading and downgrading the bird conditions commensurate
   with updated information. The Tower, aircrews or flight safety may recommend upgrading
   or downgrading a BWC when the observed condition changes.
   6.23.5. AMOPS will notify the Tower, 81 TRW/CP, 81 TRW/SEF, 815 AS, 53 WRS and
   345 AS, when a BWC is declared. The BWC will also be posted in the flight planning room
   for transient aircrews.
   6.23.6. The primary means of transmitting the BWC will be the ATIS. Pilots must ensure
   they understand the conditions and their option to delay, divert or continue the proposed
   operation.
   6.23.7. The methods used to scare birds on the airfield are: pyrotechnics, harassment with
   vehicles and depredation. Under BWC severe AMOPS may suspend runway operations until
   the bird concentration near the runway has decreased to a level that will not jeopardize flight
   safety.
6.24. Duty Officer/Supervisor of Flying (SOF) Operating from the Tower. Keesler AFB
does not operate with a SOF/Duty Officer in the Tower.
6.25. Taking of Photographs. All personnel must coordinate with AMOPS before taking
photographs in the airfield environment. AMOPS will then notify 81 SFS and 403d PA that a
KEESLEAFBI13-201 16 April 2013                                                                39


certain individual or personnel will be taking photographs. Any unauthorized personnel taking
photographs must be reported to 81 SFS. 81 SFS personnel have the discretion to confiscate
cameras and/or film used during the event.
   6.25.1. AMOPS is authorized to take photos on the airfield during the performance of
   official duties.
6.26. Explosive Detection K-9 Teams. Controllers shall relay military or civilian pilot requests
regarding the location of the nearest explosive detection K-9 team to 81 TRW/CP.
6.27. Flares. The munitions involved with the explosives operation for the 403 WG will have a
hazard class/division of 1.3 mass fire hazard and 1.4 moderate fire hazard. The net explosive
weight to be loaded on an aircraft in support of air defense operations will not exceed 70 pounds
maximum. These munitions function via 28 volt electrical impulses provided by the aircraft.
The aircraft loading spots will be 1 - 11 and 17 - 23. Refer to AFMAN 91-201, Explosives
Safety Standards, and DoD 6055.9-STD, DOD Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards,
standard for separation criteria of explosive-laden aircraft parking areas and munitions
storage/operating locations.
   6.27.1. Aircrew Signal Flare Training Coordination. The 81 OSF/CC and Chief, Aircrew
   Life Support Shop (815th, 345th, or 53d WRS) will ensure all personnel understand and
   comply with these procedures.
       6.27.1.1. The NCOIC, Aircrew Life Support Shop will coordinate with AMOPS at least
       24 hours prior to flare start time and ensure life support personnel have a land mobile
       radio (LMR), tuned on the ramp net.
       6.27.1.2. Contact the Control Tower one hour prior to commencing flare operations via
       LMR to obtain approval to initiate flare training. Also provide notification to the U.S.
       Coast Guard Gulfport at 228-868-3743 or 228-865-9754.
       6.27.1.3. Terminate training if directed by the Tower.         Notify the Tower upon
       termination of flare training.
       6.27.1.4. AMOPS will brief 53d WRS and 815th AS personnel on airfield safety
       procedures. Send a NOTAM advertising start/stop times of flare training.
       6.27.1.5. The Tower will authorize the life support branch to conduct flare training when
       air traffic operations permit.
       6.27.1.6. Terminate flare operations when deemed necessary by the Tower WS/SC based
       on air traffic activity, which might adversely affect flight safety.
       6.27.1.7. Advise Gulfport Approach of the flare training and include an advisory on the
       ATIS.
       6.27.1.8. Restrictions. The types of signal flares to be used in aircrew signal flare
       training are limited to the A/P 25S/5A Personnel Distress Signal Kit Day/Night signal
       flares. Signal flares will go distances of 750’ to 1,200’ upon expenditure. Mark 13 and
       124 flares consist of white/orange smoke. Training will take place at the North end of the
       airfield near the Marina.
6.28. Base Rescue/Fire Fighting Capability. AMOPS will contact the Fire Department daily
to determine the base fire rescue/fire fighting capabilities. When base rescue or fire fighting
 40                                                       KEESLEAFBI13-201 16 April 2013


capabilities are reduced to a level that local flight operations cannot be supported, AMOPS will
notify 81 OSF/CC, 81 MSG/CC, 81 TRW/CV, 403d OG/CC and 403d WG MOC. AMOPS will
issue the appropriate NOTAM and receive the status of firefighting capability from the Fire
Department. All information will be annotated on AF Form 3616.
6.29. Airfield/Air Traffic Control and Landing Systems (ATCALS) Operational
Status. The Tower is the primary Keesler NOTAM monitoring facility for all ATCALS issues.
AMOPS is the secondary monitoring facility. AMOPS is the focal point for all airfield issues
and is responsible for disseminating all NOTAM information. Base agencies will contact the
Tower or AMOPS to coordinate scheduled ATCALS outages and for all runway and taxiway
closures. AMOPS will coordinate all status changes or requests with the 81 OSF/CC. For
further ATCALS operational issues, see Attachment 7 for the ATCALS Operations Procedures.
   6.29.1. 81 CS Airfield Systems will coordinate all scheduled ATCALS outages with the 81
   OSF/CC prior to removing a system from operation. The following ATCALS procedures are
   not applicable at Keesler: downgrading ILS to Category (CAT) I status, bypassing interlocks
   on multiple ILS facilities and ATCALS in the National Airspace System (NAS).
6.30. Airfield Quiet Hours/Ramp Freeze. In an effort to minimize noise during wing parades
and other special events taking place on or near the airfield, the aerodrome may be designated as
Official Business Only (OBO). Approval/disapproval authority for OBO airfield restrictions
lasting less than 30 days rests with the 81 TRW/CV.
   6.30.1. During the coordinated quiet hour timeframe, airfield operations will be limited to
   emergency, MEDEVAC or Lifeguard and mission essential aircraft. No engine runs or
   practice approaches at Keesler will be allowed. Maintenance crews will be allowed to use jet
   carts during established quiet hours.
   6.30.2. Responsibility for coordinating airfield quiet hours rests with the unit hosting the
   event. The requesting unit must coordinate with AMOPS at 377-2120 no less than seven
   working days prior to the event. AMOPS will contact the 403d WG at least 48 hours in
   advance and issue the appropriate NOTAM information.
   6.30.3. A ramp freeze entails that no vehicles will be permitted to operate on the CMA and
   aircraft will not be allowed to taxi or land once the ramp freeze has been initiated. Aircraft
   arrivals will be coordinated with AMOPS before landing. All ramp personnel will remain
   inside during the ramp freeze.
6.31. Airfield Radio/Visual Blind Spots. There are no radio blind spots. Visual blind spots are
between the Roberts Aircraft Maintenance facility and Hangar 4, between Hangar 3/4, near
Taxiway Foxtrot and behind the Iso Dock hangar on the Backline. Visual blind spots are from
the Tower’s point of view.
6.32. Kite Flying. Kite flying near an airfield can present an extreme hazard to aircraft during
the critical stages of flight on departure and arrival. Kite flying is prohibited in areas
immediately encompassing the airfield, specifically the grassy areas at the North end of the
runway near the baseball fields. The Tower will notify AMOPS upon observing kite flying
activities. AMOPS will then dispatch a representative to inform personnel of the infraction and
have them leave the premises. AMOPS may contact 81 SFS in lieu of reporting to the site.
KEESLEAFBI13-201 16 April 2013                                                                 41


6.33. No Light Approach Visibility Minima. Approach minima are adjusted and NOTAM
actions will be accomplished by AMOPS IAW AFMAN 11-230, Instrument Procedures, in the
event that the approach lights for Runway 21 become inoperative. The minima in the FLIPS
apply.
   6.33.1. The Tower will advise Gulfport Approach and arriving aircraft of the outages and the
   new visibility minima via the ATIS. Lighting outages will also be sent via NOTAM.
6.34. Unusual Maneuvers. Unusual maneuvers (i.e. aerobatics) other than those contained in
this instruction and other local operating procedures require FAA approval. Forward all requests
through appropriate FAA channels.
6.35. Night Vision Device (NVD) Procedures. The NVD procedures set out in the
subparagraphs below are primarily intended for 403d WG aircraft, but may be used by other
agencies with an applicable LOA. There are currently no exceptions to FAR 91.209 granted by
the FAA to allow aircraft to operate without lighted position lights and obstruction lights within
any Tower surface area airspace class within the U.S.
   6.35.1. If NVD operational hours are published for the requested time and days in the IFR
   Supplement, no NOTAM is required.
   6.35.2. When NVD operations are in effect, the Tower will broadcast this on the ATIS. A
   NOTAM will also be published by AMOPS if the date and time is not published in the IFR
   Supplement.
   6.35.3. Weather requirements for NVD operations are VFR conditions. If the weather goes
   below VFR minimums (1,000 and 3 miles) the airfield lighting will be returned to normal
   configurations IAW JO 7110.65.
   6.35.4. Normal taxi routes and traffic patterns will be used for NVD operations. Aircraft
   may enter the pattern at normal entry points.
   6.35.5. The maximum number of NVD aircraft operating within the Class Delta surface area
   is two at the discretion of the Tower WS. The Tower WS may reduce NVD operations to
   only one or discontinue NVD ops if he/she deems necessary. Nonparticipating aircraft will
   not be mixed with participating NVD aircraft in any traffic pattern or on any CMA.
   Nonparticipating aircraft will not be allowed to enter the Class Delta unless the aircraft has
   declared an emergency.
   6.35.6. Current NVD optics capabilities are insufficient to allow controllers to ensure visual
   separation between aircraft at every location within the Tower’s designated airspace at all
   times under the best of conditions. Due to this fact and that many environmental factors (i.e.
   nearby facility, street) remain beyond the control of the Tower and can greatly degrade NVD
   utility, NVDs shall not be used to provide positive air traffic control within the Tower’s
   surface area.
   6.35.7. Standard airfield lighting will be turned on for nonparticipating aircraft IAW JO
   7110.65 prior to an arriving aircraft reaching the Final Approach Fix (FAF) or the Class
   Delta surface area whichever occurs first and prior to a departing aircraft entering the
   runway/taxiway.
 42                                                           KEESLEAFBI13-201 16 April 2013


   6.35.8. Standard airfield lighting will remain on for arriving nonparticipating aircraft until
   the aircraft has exited the runway/taxiway and until a departing aircraft has left the Class
   Delta surface area.
   6.35.9. Airfield lighting during NVD operations will vary depending on NVD operation
   requested by the aircrew. The airport beacon and all obstruction lights shall remain on
   during NVD operations. Taxiway/runway lights, PAPIs, approach lights and REILs will be
   turned off. The Tower will notify AMOPS before turning off the airfield lights. The Tower
   WS/SC will also notify Gulfport Approach when aircraft are conducting NVD approaches.
      6.35.10. The Tower cab lighting will be utilized as directed by the WS/SC.
      6.35.11. Aircraft navigation lights are required in the pattern IAW FARs. Aircraft may elect
      not to utilize landing lights, but will have at a minimum, a set of forward-facing white lights.
      6.35.12. Emergency knock-off/termination of NVD operations may be initiated by the
      Tower or the aircrew at any time. The Tower shall notify participating NVD aircrews at least
      one minute prior to turning on standard airfield lighting by issuing the phraseology
      “TERMINATE NVD OPERATIONS.” Note: Controllers should plan far enough ahead to
      ensure aircrews are notified that the airfield lights will be turned on prior to the NVD aircraft
      turning base.
      6.35.13. All vehicles operating near the CMA shall utilize standard vehicle lighting. IAW
      AFI 13-213, Infrared (IR) strobes are not authorized. Vehicle operations should be kept to a
      minimum during NVD operations. Vehicle speed is limited to 10 MPH. Only aircraft tows
      will be allowed in the CMA during NVD operations. No other vehicles will be allowed in
      the CMA
      6.35.14. The Tower will not issue landing or takeoff clearances to aircraft conducting NVD
      operations. The Tower will issue safety advisories and the phraseology
      “DEPARTURE/LANDING WILL BE AT YOUR OWN RISK.”
      6.35.15. An AMP-3 configuration, “box and 1” concept, is established with IR lighting for
      the LZ touchdown zones on Keesler’s runway IAW AFI 13-217.
6.36. Base Exercises. Wing officials must notify the 81 OSF/CC at least 48 hours in advance of
exercises that involve any ATC facility or the airport Controlled Movement Area IAW AFI 13-
204v3 IC 1. The 81 OSF/CC must approve, in advance, exercises that include removing
controllers to alternate facilities or shelter areas. The AFM must also be informed of exercises
that affect the airfield IAW AFI 13-204v3 IC 1.
6.37. Taxiway Charlie Aircraft Rinse Facility. The Taxiway Charlie aircraft rinse facility is
limited to C-130 and larger aircraft only. The Tower approves the use of the aircraft rinse station
and allows aircraft into the rinse station based on airport traffic conditions.
      6.37.1. The Tower will ensure aircraft do not interfere with runway operations.         Note:
      The Tower shall not clear an aircraft to depart or conduct an approach until the aircraft
      utilizing the rinse facility has reported clear/observed clear of the VFR hold line on Taxiway
      Charlie. In the event that the aircraft is still in the runway environment, an aircraft
      conducting an approach shall be limited to a restricted low approach until the aircraft is past
      the VFR hold line.
KEESLEAFBI13-201 16 April 2013                                                                    43


   6.37.2. Aircrews will remain responsible for the aircraft during its entry into and out of the
   rinse station. Aircrews will also taxi as directed by the Tower through the rinse facility.
   6.37.3. AMOPS will be notified of a rinse facility malfunction when noted by the Tower or
   aircrew. AMOPS will then notify CE for repair.
   6.37.4. CSC will expeditiously respond to the airfield for repair of the rinse station if the
   facility is impacting airfield operations (i.e. water remains on after aircraft has exited the
   rinse facility).
   6.37.5. Keesler assigned C-130 aircraft will proceed through the rinse facility when
   approved by the Tower and call off the runway to the Tower on 120.75 or 269.075.
   6.37.6. Pilots will adhere to the following procedures:
       6.37.6.1. If landing Runway 21, aircrews should make their request before landing to
       taxi directly through the rinse facility. If landing Runway 03, aircrews shall make their
       request before landing and expect to back taxi after landing and then taxi directly through
       the rinse facility. Note: Pilots shall report past the VFR hold line to the Tower.
       6.37.6.2. C-130 and larger aircraft shall be instructed to turn around on the concrete
       portion of runway by the Tower. After the Tower approves and directs the aircraft to
       enter Taxiway Charlie, the pilot will ensure the nose wheel of the aircraft crosses over the
       magnetic device located on the taxiway indicated by a white line.
       6.37.6.3. The magnetic device sensor has more than a thirty-second delay before it
       triggers the rinsing mechanism. The total cycle should take approximately 3 to 4 minutes
       to rinse the aircraft. Aircrews should proceed through the rinse facility at their discretion.
       6.37.6.4. Only one aircraft may proceed through the rinse facility at a time. Aircrews
       will taxi back to parking via normal taxi routes.
       6.37.6.5. Transient aircraft are permitted to use the rinse facility providing the aircraft is
       capable of the high water pressure.
       6.37.6.6. Aircraft taxiing to the runway via Charlie will not trigger a rinse cycle unless
       the aircraft remains within 20 feet of the magnetic device for longer than 30 seconds.
       6.37.6.7. Aircraft holding short of the runway prior to the VFR hold line and normal taxi
       procedures will not trigger a rinse cycle.
6.38. Air Base Surveillance Priorities. Keesler does not utilize air base surveillance priorities.
6.39. Military Authority Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft
(MARSA). ATC will not invoke or deny MARSA. Primary separation responsibility within the
flight conducting MARSA belongs solely to the aircraft commanders involved in the flight.
ATC’s sole responsibility concerning the use of MARSA is to provide separation between
military aircraft engaged in MARSA operations and other nonparticipating IFR aircraft.
MARSA will not be invoked indiscriminately by individual units or pilots. It will be used only
for IFR operations requiring its use.
6.40. Cooperative Quality Assurance and Safety Programs. There are established base-level
programs that are designed to periodically assess the 81 OSF’s integrated participation with other
agencies in supporting the Wing flying mission.
 44                                                      KEESLEAFBI13-201 16 April 2013


   6.40.1. MACA Program. The purpose of this program is to highlight the potential for
   midair collisions in the local flying environment and to provide aircrews advice and tips on
   how to avoid them. 81 TRW Flight Safety is the OPR for this program.
   6.40.2. 81 TRW/SE and 403 WG/SE will:
       6.40.2.1. Monitor the MACA Program and report the program’s status annually at the
       AOB. The main purpose of the MACA program is to highlight the potential for mid-air
       collisions in the local flying environment and provide aircrews advice on how to avoid
       them.
       6.40.2.2. Work with the 81 OSF to update the MACA pamphlet. A thorough review of
       the pamphlet should be completed annually or as required. This information will be
       reported at the appropriate AOB.
       6.40.2.3. Attend quarterly Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport Safety and Security
       meetings and MACA visits to adjacent airports (as required).
6.41. Combat Off-load/On-load Procedures.
   6.41.1. Combat Off-load. Combat off-loads are conducted on the concrete portion of
   Taxiway Alpha near the back line. Combat off-loads may be conducted during day or night
   time operations. Current Operations will coordinate with the 41st Aerial Port Squadron
   (APS) to ensure 41st APS personnel are readily available with equipment to support combat
   offloads. Aircrews shall contact AMOPS on PTD (UHF 372.2) and request approval prior
   to commencing combat off-load procedures. The aircrew shall also notify the Tower and
   request approval before combat off-load operations are started to allow the Tower controllers
   to de-conflict existing and future aircraft that may utilize Taxiway Alpha. Figure 6.1 shows
   a diagram of the established combat offload/on-load location.

Figure 6.1. Combat Offload/On-load Location.




Note: Drivers of forklifts/other maintenance vehicles associated with these procedures will not
operate on the airfield with NVDs on.
       6.41.1.1. Extreme vigilance is required when conducting combat off-load operations.
       The 41st APS shall be readily available to pick up any cargo off-loaded before these
       operations begin. The 41 APS should request access from the back line and utilize the
       call sign “FORKLIFT 1” when accessing the CMA; if another vehicle or person on foot
       accesses the CMA during operations, the call sign will be ‘FORKLIFT 1 PLUS 1”.
       Cargo shall not be left unattended on the taxiway for an extended period of time (longer
       than 5 minutes).
KEESLEAFBI13-201 16 April 2013                                                          45


  6.41.2. Combat On-load. The aircrew shall coordinate with AMOPS and the Tower and
  request approval from the Tower before conducting combat on-load procedures. The
  primary location for combat on-loads is on the concrete portion of Taxiway Alpha near the
  Back line.
