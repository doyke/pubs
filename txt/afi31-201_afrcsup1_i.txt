                                                  Chapter 3

                                   SECURITY POLICE PERSONNEL


3.1. Security Police Code of Conduct. No code or set of rules will specify exactly what you should do
in every situation. However, the following code provides general guidelines.
     3.1.1. Exercising Authority. As on-duty security police, you are the visible representatives of the US
     Government, the Air Force, the installation commander, and the installation chief of security police.
     It is your duty to accept the authority entrusted to you and to carry out this important trust impartially,
     firmly, and in a manner that commands respect from the public.
     3.1.2. Fulfilling the Mission. The enforcement of laws and regulations dealing with members of the
     US Armed Forces brings security police into direct contact with the public. In fulfilling the security
     police mission, you must deal with offenders in a dignified manner. Refrain from being disobedient,
     insulting, or offensive to the public.
     3.1.3. Personal Appearance. Maintain a high standard of appearance IAW AFI 36-2903, Dress and
     Personal Appearance of Personnel. Set the example for all to follow.
     3.1.4. Personal Attitudes. Perform your duties in an impartial, just, friendly, and helpful manner. The
     Air Force will not tolerate biases based on age, physical disability, race, religion, national origin,
     creed, or gender. Do not discuss offenses or incidents, except in the line of duty. In addition, you can
     not accept any advantage, gratuity, or reward for performing official duties.
     3.1.5. Assistance to Others. Render assistance to the public. Promptly assist any injured or ill indi-
     viduals.
     3.1.6. Attention to Duty. Remain mindful of your duty commitments. Do not consume any form of
     intoxicant while on duty or within eight hours of a duty tour.
     3.1.6. (AFRC) The blood alcohol content (BAC) standard for military and civilian personnel bearing
     firearms is zero. No person shall be issued or bear firearms when a trace of alcohol is detected.
     3.1.7. Seeking Favors. Do not seek personal advantage through your status as security police. Don't
     try to gain favor or popularity by showing favoritism, overlooking violations, or otherwise failing to
     enforce the law.
     3.1.8. Punishment of Offenders. As security police, you have the authority only to apprehend, based
     on reasonable grounds. Do not punish offenders. Use your discretion to correct, caution, or warn
     someone for minor violations of the law, but you may not admonish or reprimand.
     3.1.9. Apprehension of Suspects. Protect the health and welfare of all apprehended suspects. Use
     force according to AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel. The USAF will not
     tolerate the intentional mistreatment of apprehended suspects. Don't use abusive, profane, or insulting
     language toward a suspect or show disregard for the suspect's valuables, personal property, or physical
     well being.
     3.1.10. Dealing with Intoxicated Persons. Apprehend personnel obviously intoxicated beyond any
     sense of self-control and mobility. Make every effort to avoid verbal and physical confrontations.
AFI31-201_AFRCSUP1_I 16 JUNE 2003                                                                          11


   3.1.11. Off Duty Conduct. You represent the security police force 24 hours a day, regardless of the
   duty schedule. Therefore, your conduct must always remain above reproach.

3.2. Duties and Responsibilities. Security police duties and responsibilities vary greatly from installa-
tion to installation. Installation CSPs should define the number and limits of security police posts, as well
as assigned duties, in local duty or post instructions. Our three basic duties and responsibilities are always
the same. They are:
   3.2.1. Take charge of your post by securing and protecting personnel and property for which you are
   responsible until properly relieved. Comply with orders and instructions given. These responsibili-
   ties continue until relieved by proper authority.
   3.2.2. Report all violations of orders you must enforce. You have the authority to apprehend anyone
   violating those orders. Notify the appropriate control center of the apprehension and detain the appre-
   hended person until assistance arrives. Written procedures can not cover all situations. In such situa-
   tions, you must exercise discretion and act according to your best judgment. Immediately contact
   your superior for instructions.
   3.2.3. Give the alarm in case of disorder or emergency. Report any unusual event that threatens the
   security of the installation or endangers life or property. Take reasonable counteraction to save life
   and property or lessen danger. At the same time, you must maintain the security of your post and
   remain alert for other possible violations during the emergency.
   3.2.4. (Added-AFRC) Special precautions must always be taken when at a site where known or sus-
   pected hazards are present (body fluids, drug paraphernalia, toxic chemicals, etc.) Supervisors ensure
   subordinates are properly equipped to safely assist during these situations. Patrols must be equipped
   with a kit to provide protection from blood-borne pathogens (see paragraph 4.7.8. of this instruction).

                                                 Chapter 4

                           SECURITY POLICE DRESS AND EQUIPMENT


4.1. General Information. As security police, you wear a distinctive uniform for quick identification.
Because you are constantly in the "public eye," you must set the highest standard of dress and appearance.
AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Personnel, contains guidance on proper wear of security
police uniforms.

4.2. The Security Police Shield. Only uniformed security police wear the security police shield. Don't
abuse this symbol of authority for personal gain. AFI 31-206, Security Police Investigations, establishes
procedures for display of the shield by security police investigators not in uniform.
     4.2.1. The following guidelines apply to the issue and wear of the security police shield:
        4.2.1.1. Issue metallic shields IAW Table of Allowance (TA) 016, Table of Allowances for Special
        Purpose Clothing and Personal Equipment.
        4.2.1.2. Use AF Form 538, Personal Clothing and Equipment Record, or a similar automated
        product, to record shield issues.
        4.2.1.3. Upon PCS of the bearer, forward the AF Form 538 or automated product to the gaining
        unit IAW procedures established in AFM 67-1, Vol. II, Part 2.
        4.2.1.4. Reissue serviceable shields turned in due to loss of Air Force specialty code (AFSC) or
        other disqualifying factors.
        4.2.1.5. Wear the metallic shield only on the blue uniform combinations.
        4.2.1.6. Don't wear or carry the shield while in civilian clothes except as authorized for security
        police investigators performing official duties.
        4.2.1.7. Security police who are retraining or separating from the service turn in their security
        police shield to the shield issuing activity. The installation CSP may elect to present the shield to
        retiring security police or the next of kin to security police who die while on active duty.

4.3. The Law Enforcement Qualification Badge. CSPs at each level may authorize persons in their
command to wear this badge. HQ USAF/SF may authorize appropriate persons to wear the badge. Award
this badge to military personnel who acquire certain skill levels and demonstrate honorable service in the
security police career field. Award the badge according to AFI 36-2923, Aeronautical, Duty, and Occu-
pational Badges.
     4.3.1. Allied nation, other US service, and other USAF personnel performing instructor or liaison
     duty with an Air Force security police organization wear the qualification badge commensurate with
     time requirements listed in AFI 36-2923.
     4.3.2. Officers and airmen assigned to the US Air Force Reserve (USAFR) or ANG are eligible for
     award of the qualification badge under paragraph 4.3.
     4.3.3. Once approved, present the badge at an appropriate ceremony.
AFI31-201_AFRCSUP1_I 16 JUNE 2003                                                                        13


   4.3.4. The installation CSP (at all levels) may rescind the badge anytime the bearer loses their secu-
   rity police AFSC for misconduct.

4.4. Resources and Equipment. HQ AFSFC/SFOR identifies and evaluates commercially available and
government-developed equipment necessary to support service-wide needs for security forces personnel.
SFOR:
   4.4.1. Serves as the central point of contact for security police logistics information throughout the
   Air Force.
   4.4.2. Disseminates security police equipment information, test reports, and material deficiencies.
   4.4.3. Monitors new and emerging technologies for security police applications.
   4.4.4. Manages, monitors, or provides approval authority, as appropriate, for the following TAs deal-
   ing with security police equipment:
       4.4.4.1. TA 001 -- Master Equipment Management Index.
       4.4.4.2. TA 002 -- Monthly Allowance Notice (Update).
       4.4.4.3. TA 009 -- Small Computers and Equipment.
       4.4.4.4. TA 012 -- Vehicles.
       4.4.4.5. TA 016 -- Clothing.
       4.4.4.6. TA 538 -- Security Police Equipment (General) and Weapons.
       4.4.4.7. TA 629 -- Audio Visual.
       4.4.4.8. TA 660 -- Communications Equipment.
   4.4.5. SPR conducts an annual Air Force security police equipment workshop to update equipment
   listings, provide a forum to work security police-related equipment problems and issues, and work
   logistics detail issues with MAJCOM security police staff representatives.

4.5. Land Mobile Radio (LMR) Systems . The LMR system is the primary means of communication
used to control security police operations. MAJCOMs determine requirements for "secure voice" equip-
ment.
   4.5.1. Security police use standard practices to ensure the radio net operates smoothly during normal
   and emergency situations. Don't use slang language. Military radio transmissions must comply with
   Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations. The Allied Communication Publication
   (ACP) 125 (E) dated 1 Aug 87, prescribes procedures for security police using two-way radios.
   4.5.2. Net Control Station. When two or more two-way radios use a single radio net (frequency),
   establish a net control station according to the local installation communications officer's direction.
   4.5.3. Commanders ensure a positive Communications Security (COMSEC) program exists for radio
   communications when they:
       4.5.3.1. Use standard response codes to identify the urgency of each radio dispatch (See Attach-
       ment 1 for established response codes).
14                                                             AFI31-201_AFRCSUP1_I 16 JUNE 2003


        4.5.3.2. Devise a local duress or signal codes to indicate an emergency or duress situation when
        one does not wish to alert any unauthorized listeners.
        4.5.3.3. Decode data encryption system equipped radios before servicing.
        4.5.3.4. Decode vehicle radios before releasing the vehicle to any maintenance activity.
     4.5.4. Consider equipping the law enforcement desk with a citizens band (CB) two-way radio to aid
     in crime prevention and incident reporting, and a two-way radio capable of communicating on the
     commonwealth, host-state, or territory police emergency frequency. If a two-way radio is not avail-
     able or practical, use a mutually agreed upon system that facilitates rapid emergency notification to
     civilian police like E-911. Negotiate for and fund such equipment at the installation level. Set up
     operating instructions according to host-state, commonwealth, or territorial laws or police regulations.

4.6. Telephone Systems . Commercial and tactical telephone systems augment the LMR. Connect all
fixed security police posts to the law enforcement desk or central security control by dial or direct tele-
phone lines.
     4.6.1. The FCC regulates communications by wire and radio. Military radio transmissions are sub-
     ject to FCC monitoring and regulation. FCC regulations prohibit:
        4.6.1.1. Use of profane or obscene language in radio transmissions.
        4.6.1.2. Use of false or deceptive signals or communications.
        4.6.1.3. Operation of an unlicensed station.
        4.6.1.4. Operation of a station by unauthorized personnel.

4.7. Vehicle Equipment. TAs and technical orders (TO) establish authorized equipment and markings.
As a minimum, equip permanently assigned non-tactical vehicles with the following:
     4.7.1. Warning Light System. Use a warning light system in the form of a magnetic or permanent
     mount-type single or multiple flasher, rotating, or strobe light system. Mount the system either on the
     vehicle roof, on a "roof bar," on the dashboard and rear window platform, or on the front bumper and
     the rear window platform. Do not mount lights inside the vehicle front grill.
     4.7.2. Siren System. Use either the traditional "fire engine" or electronic sirens. Mount the siren in
     concert with a roof-mounted warning light system or under the vehicle hood.
     4.7.3. Public Address System. Use either a portable system ("bullhorn") or a permanent system.
     Mount the system in concert with a roof-mounted warning light bar system or under the vehicle's
     hood.
     4.7.4. Spotlight. Use either a portable spotlight (battery-operated or cigarette lighter plug-in type) or
     a permanently mounted spotlight. If you use a permanent-mount type, mount the spotlight on the
     vehicle roof, "roof bar," or on the driver's side door frame pillar.
     4.7.5. Land Mobile Radio. Use a permanently mounted multichannel mobile or "portamobile" radio.
     Install radios so the driver has easy access to all radio controls and microphones and so radio equip-
     ment does not interfere with safe vehicle operation.
AFI31-201_AFRCSUP1_I 16 JUNE 2003                                                                          15


   4.7.5. (AFRC) A security force member equipped with a portable radio meets the requirement until
   permanently mounted equipment can be procured and installed. For temporary use or loaner vehicles,
   patrol officers’ mobile/handheld radios suffice.
   4.7.6. A general purpose first aid kit (FSN 6545-00-922-1200 or equivalent).
   4.7.7. Extinguisher--a 2 1/2 pound ABC rated dry chemical fire extinguisher.
   4.7.8. Bloodborne Pathogen Protective Kit (required in all security police vehicles). Contents must
   include one-way respiratory cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) mask, surgical gloves, eye protec-
   tive goggles or glasses with side shields, surgical mask, and surgical gown. The installation CSP and
   installation medical officer determine other contents of the kit. Train those personnel determined to
   have occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens to use kit contents. Attachment 2 contains the
   requirements for a Bloodborne Pathogen Exposure Control Plan.

4.8. Vehicle Identification Markings . All vehicle markings must comply with TO 36-1-3, Painting,
Marking, and Lighting Requirements for USAF Vehicles.
   4.8.1. As a minimum, mark all security forces vehicles on the driver and front passenger doors (vehi-
   cles marked IAW T.O. 36-1-3 meet this requirement). The markings may be magnetic or perma-
   nent-mount type. Each sign will have “Security Forces” printed in black or ultramarine blue letters on
   a reflective white background. Lettering is a minimum of 3 inches in height. Units may use a magnetic
   18 inch or larger security police shield replica instead of the “security forces” sign. 911 or other emer-
   gency notification procedures may be magnetically or permanently affixed as well.
   4.8.2. When security police vehicles are temporarily out of service due to maintenance, you may use
   "loaner" vehicles for security police patrol. Equip such vehicles with a magnetic rotating, flashing, or
   strobe warning light and magnetic "SECURITY POLICE" or shield replica signs.
   4.8.3. Equip and mark tactical security police vehicles according to installation or MAJCOM direc-
   tives.

4.9. Speedometer Calibration. Calibrate the speedometers of all traffic patrol vehicles at least semian-
nually or sooner if local laws are more stringent. Recalibrate the vehicle's speedometer any time there are
major maintenance repairs to a traffic patrol vehicle's transmission, differential, speedometer, or after tire
replacement.

4.10. Vehicle and Vehicle Equipment Care. Before each tour of duty, inspect vehicles and vehicle
equipment for safety and maintenance deficiencies. Test all warning lights, sirens, public address sys-
tems, spotlights, etc. Report deficiencies to the vehicle maintenance branch as soon as possible. Vehicles
should always present a clean appearance, weather permitting.

4.11. Vehicle Installed Video Surveillance Systems. Units may use vehicle installed video surveil-
lance systems as a tool to enhance their law enforcement and public safety role. Carefully evaluate the
cost and the need before buying video systems. The following guidelines apply:
   4.11.1. MAJCOMs approve unit requests for video system use. Units must develop policy governing
   their use, control, disposition of film, etc., before purchase. As a minimum, the vehicle mounted
   video system may only be used when actively engaged in patrol activities and cannot be in use when
   the vehicle is parked and unattended.

     4.11.1. (AFRC) Submit unit request to use vehicle installed video surveillance systems to HQ AFRC/
     SFO.
     4.11.2. There is no centrally managed procurement program. Units must determine needs locally and
     procure the appropriate system that best meets their needs. Consult state and local requirements for
     possible restrictions.
     4.11.3. Follow standard supply acquisition procedures.
AFI31-201_AFRCSUP1_I 16 JUNE 2003                                                                          17


                                                 Chapter 5

                                  SECURITY POLICE ACTIVITIES


5.1. Security Police Guardmount. Guardmount is a ceremony conducted at the start of the security
police shift. Use guardmount to determine the readiness of personnel, to include their appearance and
mental and physical condition. Use guardmount to conduct roll call, announcements, security status
briefing, weapons inspection, and post assignments. You should also use guardmount as a recognition
ceremony for deserving personnel.

5.2. Installation Entry Control. Controlling entry to the installation is a fundamental security police
task. We control entry to facilitate vehicle and pedestrian access in an orderly, safe, and secure manner,
and to provide controls to help protect the resources entrusted to the Air Force. The installation entry con-
troller is a very visible sign of the professionalism and strength of an Air Force installation and its
assigned mission. Accordingly, entry controllers represent the most senior authority on base--usually the
wing commander. Because of their location, they are normally the first contact the public has with the Air
Force base. For this reason, the installation entry controller is often referred to as the Air Force's "ambas-
sador to the public."
   5.2.1. Control entry to the base in a manner that brings credit to the Air Force. A properly established
   installation entry control function begins with a professionally constructed gate house which provides
   protection from adverse weather and accommodations for continuous operation. Safety and security
   for people transiting that location is inherent in its design. Finally, it provides an aesthetic quality
   which reflects the pride of the wing's mission and the professionalism of Air Force operating style.
   The gate house is then staffed with sharp, energetic, and courteous security police professionals. The
   Air Force places great value on properly conducted installation entry control because it reflects the
   confidence, strength, and trust of our superiors and the American people.

5.3. Post Checks. On-duty supervisory personnel conduct post checks to ensure posted personnel are
alert and knowledgeable of the assigned duties and responsibilities. Post checks include an inspection of
security police facilities and equipment.

5.4. Post Visits. Post visits are a means for senior security police representatives to visit on-duty security
police to verify their job knowledge and performance in their work environment. It is also a way to
inspect facilities, take questions, detect problem areas, and ascertain the welfare of personnel. Conduct
post visits during both traditional and non-traditional duty hours.

5.5. Post Reporting. Report the status of your post to the senior person conducting the post check or
visit.

5.6. Defender Challenge. Defender Challenge is an annual security forces skills competition sponsored
by HQ USAF/XOF. Representative teams from MAJCOMS, ANG, USAFR, United States Air Force
Academy, 11th Wing, and selected allied countries compete in physical endurance, marksmanship and
combat-related events.

                                                   Chapter 6

                          JURISDICTION, LIMITATIONS, AND LIABILITY


6.1. Jurisdiction. The installation staff judge advocate is the focal point for determining security police
jurisdiction. You must know the jurisdiction on your installation.
6.1. (AFRC) Incorporate training on base and local jurisdiction in unit Phase 1 training programs.
     6.1.1. As security police, you are representatives of the US Government, the US Armed Forces, the
     installation commander, and the installation chief of security police. The Manual for Courts-Martial,
     Rules for Courts-Martial (RCM), Rule 302(b)(1), gives you the authority to apprehend individuals.
     Carry out this important trust in a fair, impartial and firm manner.
     6.1.2. The Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), Article 136(b)(6), gives you the authority to
     administer oaths to witnesses and suspects, as necessary, in the performance of your duties.

6.2. Posse Comitatus Act. The Congress of the United States enacted this law in 1878 to restrict the use
of the military to enforce civil law, Title 18, United States Code, Section 1385. See also 10 United States
Code Section 375.
     6.2.1. This act prevents military personnel from executing the laws of the states or the laws of the
     United States except when acting under the authority of the US Constitution, an Act of Congress, and
     under the direction of the President of the United States. Posse Comitatus governs the use of military
     personnel only within the CONUS.
     6.2.2. This act does not prevent:
        6.2.2.1. Military authorities from taking action on incidents involving civilian personnel when
        such action involves a specific military purpose.
        6.2.2.2. A military member acting in an unofficial capacity to make a citizen's arrest or to take
        other action to preserve the public peace.
        6.2.2.3. Security police from using force to stop a fleeing felon or suspected felon for the purpose
        of aiding civilian law enforcement.
     6.2.3. Off-duty security forces enlisted members may serve as members of a civilian police agency,
     either as a regular or reserve duty police officer, provided such service is in their personal capabilities,
     does not require the exercise of military authority, and does not interfere with their military duties.
     Subject to the same restrictions, commissioned officers may engage in similar off-duty employment,
     provided they do not violate the “civil office” restriction found in 10 U.S.C § 973. The restriction pro-
     vides that regular commissioned officers, and Guard, Reserve, or retired officers called to active duty
     for more than 180 days, may not accept off-duty employment as a federal, state, or local civilian law
     enforcement official in any position which qualifies as a “civil office”. Guidance on what constitutes
     a civil office within the meaning of 10 U.S.C § 973 is contained in AFI 51-902, Political Activities by
     Members of the U.S. Air Force. All off-duty employment of security forces personnel (officer and
     enlisted) is subject to approval of their commander and must be coordinated with the servicing legal
     office.
AFI31-201_AFRCSUP1_I 16 JUNE 2003                                                                         19


6.3. Support to Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies (CLEA). Security police may support CLEAs as
authorized by federal laws and executive orders.
6.3. (AFRC) Submit reports on CLEA support along with National Incident-Based Reports System
(NIBRS) reports quarterly. Do not combine the two reports.

6.4. Support to the US Secret Service (USSS) and US State Department (DOS). Refer requests for
assistance from other federal agencies to AFOSI. When appropriately tasked to assist, Security police
support the USSS in the protection of the President and Vice President of the United States, major politi-
cal candidates, and visiting foreign heads of state. When assigned to such duty, you are subject to the
overall supervision of the Director, USSS, or Director of Diplomatic Security, as appropriate. If working
under the auspices of AFOSI for protective services, Security Police work under the supervision of the
AFOSI Protective Detail Leader.

6.5. Martial Law. The term "martial law" means "the temporary military government of a civilian popu-
lation." Declaring US federal martial law might require the US to exercise jurisdiction over the civilian
population. In time of an emergency, military jurisdiction over the civilian population extends beyond the
restoration of law and order. It provides relief and rehabilitation of the people, the resumption of indus-
trial production, the re-establishment of the economy, and the protection of life and property.

6.6. Personal Liability. Military and civilian courts may review acts performed by military personnel
during martial law for damages or in criminal proceedings.

6.7. Vehicle Operation. Each CSP must ensure security police personnel understand and follow vehicle
operation guidelines in this section and in the USAF Model Vehicle Operation Policy shown at Attach-
ment 1. CSPs may modify this policy to reflect local laws or conditions. The primary concern in emer-
gency driving situations is the protection of the lives and safety of all citizens. You must not endanger the
public as a result of your driving. Nuclear and chemical resource recovery operations are exempt from the
provisions of this section.
   6.7.1. Pursuit Driving. Pursuit driving is an extremely dangerous practice. The Air Force policy is
   that pursuit driving is inherently dangerous and should be avoided except in extreme situations.
   Examples of extreme situations include, but are not limited to: Pursuing a vehicle with material that
   is extremely dangerous to others, such as nuclear, biological, or chemical munitions or components;
   Pursuing a vehicle whose occupant(s) are suspects in an incident in which deadly force would be
   authorized. In situations where deadly force would not be authorized, consider an alternative course
   of action. Alternatives to pursuit driving include vehicle intercept, where security police stategically
   move their vehicles into a position to block the suspect vehicle, without the use of high speed or code.
   In another option, security police or witnesses obtain detailed descriptions of the vehicle, its direction
   of travel, and descriptions and number of individuals inside the vehicle. This information is quickly
   passed to the local law enforcement officials to assist in locating the suspect vehicle.
       6.7.1.1. When engaged in a vehicle pursuit, you must weigh the need to immediately apprehend a
       suspect against the danger created by the pursuit. Extreme caution must be exercised to ensure
       public safety.
   6.7.2. Safety. At no time will pursuit driving endanger the public, security police involved in the pur-
   suit, Air Force resources, or contribute to the loss of control of the vehicle.
20                                                              AFI31-201_AFRCSUP1_I 16 JUNE 2003


     6.7.3. Responsibility. Responsibility for the decision to pursue an offender initially rests with each
     vehicle operator. Carefully evaluate each situation. If you determine pursuit driving is necessary,
     consider the following factors:
     6.7.3. (AFRC) Incorporate pursuit guidelines into unit Phase 1 training programs.
        6.7.3.1. Mission Impact
        6.7.3.2. Local policy.
        6.7.3.3. The degree of danger to the public.
        6.7.3.4. The degree of danger to you and fellow patrols.
        6.7.3.5. Your experience and training.
        6.7.3.6. Weather and road conditions.
        6.7.3.7. Time of day (e.g. is it rush hour? Has school just let out? Is it the middle of the night
        with deserted streets?).
        6.7.3.8. Facilities located along the route (e.g., schools, hospital, shopping centers, etc.).
        6.7.3.9. Type of violation--If a suspect you witnessed or have reasonably grounds to believe has
        committed or attempted to commit an offense that affects Department of Defense assets vital to
        national security, and when their loss, damage or compromise would seriously jeopardize the ful-
        fillment of a national defense mission, the use of deadly force would be authorized as a last resort,
        when all lesser means of force are not feasible or have failed. Even if these use of force prerequi-
        sites are met, this does not mean you can or should disregard the safety of the public, other secu-
        rity police personnel, or yourself in exchange for a vehicle pursuit. You may be held responsible
        for injuries or deaths of others if you act with reckless disregard for the safety of others.
        6.7.3.10. Vehicle characteristics--use of emergency equipment is essential, so ensure you turn on
        the siren and emergency lights. Use both throughout the pursuit. If your vehicle is not equipped
        with emergency lights and siren, do not pursue.
        6.7.3.11. The warning effect of the siren will decrease rapidly as pursuit speed increases.
     6.7.4. Radio And Driving Techniques. Use the radio sparingly and keep the frequency open for the
     desk sergeant and other units to assist you. Where possible, use both hands on the steering wheel to
     maintain control. In the case of a two-person patrol, the rider conducts the radio communications. If
     two separate units are involved in the pursuit, the lead patrol concentrates on the suspect vehicle while
     the second patrol makes all radio transmissions concerning the pursuit. When transmitting informa-
     tion to the desk sergeant or other units, keep calm and speak clearly and coherently as possible. Do
     not shout. When a pursuit begins, call the desk sergeant immediately and relay the following informa-
     tion:
        6.7.4.1. Direction of travel.
        6.7.4.2. Vehicle description and license number.
        6.7.4.3. Number of occupants.
        6.7.4.4. Exact reason for pursuit.
        6.7.4.5. Traffic conditions and other details that will assist other patrols in the area.
AFI31-201_AFRCSUP1_I 16 JUNE 2003                                                                         21


   6.7.5. Terminating A Pursuit. Use your best judgment in evaluating the pursuit. Continuously eval-
   uate whether to continue or terminate the pursuit. Never let the element of a personal challenge enter
   into your decision. You should stop any chase when the risks of exposing you and/or the public to
   unnecessary dangers are high or the environmental conditions show the futility of continued pursuit.
6.8. (Added-AFRC) Mutual Aid Agreements . Installation Chiefs of Security Forces should establish,
in writing, formal mutual aid agreements or policies regarding assistance to federal, state, and local civil-
ian law enforcement agencies as well as the assistance civilian agencies provide to the installation. Mutual
aid agreements consider assistance to the installation from civilian Special Weapons And Tactics (SWAT)
or Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) teams, detection dog teams, etc. Coordinate agreements/policies
with the installation staff judge advocate.

                                                  Chapter 7

                           APPREHENSION, DETENTION, AND CUSTODY


7.1. Apprehension On Military Installations. You may apprehend any person subject to the UCMJ if
you have a reasonable belief the person being apprehended has engaged or is engaging in criminal activ-
ity.
     7.1.1. A reasonable belief is a belief based on the kind of reliable information that a reasonable, pru-
     dent person would rely on, which makes it more likely than not that something is true (RCM, Rule
     302(c)).
     7.1.2. Title 18, United States Code, and the US Constitution authorize the detention of civilians for
     offenses committed on a military installation. Since civilians are not normally subject to the UCMJ,
     refer civilian violators to a US Magistrate for judicial disposition or to the local civil authorities hav-
     ing jurisdiction.
     7.1.3. Installation CSP, with the advice of installation SJA, will establish local procedures for han-
     dling civilian offenders.
     7.1.4. For minor offenses, release civilian offenders to their military sponsor. If they do not have a
     military sponsor, release them to a relative, friend or on their own recognizance.
     7.1.5. The installation commander or appointed magistrate authorizes apprehensions in private dwell-
     ings.
        7.1.5.1. Use AF Form 3226, Authority to Apprehend in a Private Dwelling, to document this
        authority.
     7.1.6. Release military personnel to their first sergeant. If the first sergeant is not available, release
     military personnel to their commander. If these individuals are not available, the individual will be
     released to an individual who is an E-7/MSgt or above and is at least one grade higher than the indi-
     vidual being receipted for.

7.2. Off Installation Patrols. Security police performing patrol duties off the installation have the
authority to apprehend military personnel. However, a civilian police officer should identify all suspected
military violators in civilian clothing. Develop policies and procedures for patrol activity conducted off
installation in consultation with local civilian law enforcement officials and the staff judge advocate.
     7.2.1. Overseas. The installation commander may authorize off installation patrols. Coordinate with
     the MAJCOM Staff Judge Advocate before authorizing off installation patrols. Security police main-
     tain the authority to apprehend military personnel on or off the installation in an overseas environ-
     ment. The authority to detain civilians on a US military installation varies in each host nation.
     Bilateral agreements and directives must specify such limitations.

7.3. Custody. Custody is the restraint of free movement. An apprehension occurs when a security
policeman tells a suspect they are under apprehension. Once apprehended and in the custody of the per-
son who affected the apprehension, security police control the movements of an offender. Protect the
health and welfare of all apprehended suspects.
AFI31-201_AFRCSUP1_I 16 JUNE 2003                                                                      23


7.4. Searches. Immediately upon apprehending a suspect, conduct a search or a simple frisk of the sus-
pect for weapons and any evidence that the suspect could remove or destroy. This emphasizes the safety
of the security police and the apprehended individual. The apprehending security police person makes the
decision to frisk (without handcuffs) or to search (handcuffed). Base this decision on the situation at
hand. The situation may also warrant a search of the area under the suspect's control.

7.5. Rights Advisement. Advise suspects of their right against self-incrimination according to the
UCMJ, Article 31 (military personnel), or the US Constitution, Fifth Amendment (civilian personnel).
Use the AFVA 125-19, Advisement of Rights, for verbal advisement (usually on-scene), or the AF Form
1168, Statement of Suspect/Witness, for documented proof of rights advisement (usually prior to taking
a written statement).
7.5. (AFRC) Provide copies of these forms to unit commanders and first sergeants as needed.

7.6. Use of Force. Comply with AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel, during
apprehension and detention of suspects. Always use the minimum force necessary when placing a sus-
pect under apprehension. Use handcuffs, chemical irritant projectors, batons, and firearms only when
specifically trained in their use. In addition, you must strictly adhere to USAF standardized employment
procedures.
7.6. (AFRC) Comply with AFI 31-207/AFRC Sup 1, paragraph 1.3.4.3.2.
   7.6.1. Handcuffs. The courts consider handcuffing a use of force; therefore, you must carefully ana-
   lyze each situation to ensure you use the minimum level of force to protect yourself and others from
   injury. During an apprehension, security police may apply handcuffs to ensure control of the appre-
   hended individual during detention and search, at the apprehension site, and during transport. When
   applying handcuffs, security police use a reasonable level of force to achieve control of a resisting
   detainee. Inform unresisting detainees of the handcuffing procedure and give them the opportunity to
   cooperate. Use handcuffs as a precaution against an apprehended person who may become uncooper-
   ative or violent, to prevent escape, or to ensure personal safety.
   7.6.1. (AFRC) Carefully weigh all factors before deciding to handcuff a suspect/subject during appre-
   hension. Apprehension should not automatically warrant handcuffing.
   7.6.2. Chemical and Inflammatory Agents. Use authorized chemical agents like mace and inflamma-
   tory agents such as pepper spray as an intermediate level use of force within the United States and its
   territories and possessions.
   7.6.3. Police Club and Riot Baton. The installation CSP, with consent of the installation commander,
   determines the need and use of the police club and riot baton. If the CSP decides to authorize the use
   of the police club, the following guidelines apply:
   7.6.3. (AFRC) If used, provide annual training on methods, handling, and use of force. Ensure appli-
   cable state requirements are met. Coordinate training plans with local staff judge advocate.
       7.6.3.1. Do not use the PR-24 police baton.
       7.6.3.2. DELETE.
       7.6.3.3. If the CSP considers the police club necessary for normal wear, then consider the unob-
       trusive, collapsible type.

     7.6.4. Firearms. Security forces routinely bear firearms in the performance of duties. AFI 31-207 con-
     tains specific criterion for their authorization and use. When responding to an incident where security
     forces may meet an armed adversary, SF personnel will place their firearm in the ready position. Use
     realistic and safe exercises to develop the sound judgment required in situations that may involve the
     use of deadly force. Supervisors and exercise participants must follow the safety considerations out-
     lined in AFI 31-207.

7.7. Transporting Apprehended or Detained Persons. Search or frisk all persons in custody for weap-
ons before placing them in a security police vehicle and transporting them. Always use installed seatbelts.
     7.7.1. When transporting a suspect, notify your respective control center of the departure time and
     destination arrival time (along with odometer readings) for inclusion in the desk blotter.

                                                 Chapter 8

                                SEARCH, SEIZURE, AND EVIDENCE


8.1. Search. A search is an examination of a person, property, or premise to uncover evidence of a crime
or criminal intent (e.g., stolen goods, burglary tools, weapons, etc). Security police conduct searches of
persons, property, or areas within jurisdictional limitations. Evidence obtained in an illegal search is inad-
missible at a court-martial or other legal proceedings.

8.2. Probable Cause Search. Probable cause or reasonable grounds for a search are circumstances that
would lead a reasonable person to believe a specific offense has occurred, that a specific person commit-
ted the offense, and that the fruits or instruments of the offense are in a specific place.
   8.2.1. The special courts-martial convening authority at each installation may appoint a military mag-
   istrate to authorize probable-cause searches. Have the installation commander sign the appointment,
   and specify the installation over which the magistrate has authority. Security police will obtain the
   installation commander's (or appointed military magistrate's) permission to conduct a probable-cause
   search. Use AF Form 1176, Authority to Search and Seize, to document this action.
   8.2.2. Most searches require probable cause (reasonable grounds) or consent to be valid. There are
   unique situations where you do not need probable cause such as when entering certain controlled
   access or restricted areas.
   8.2.3. When justified, the manner and extent of the search are commensurate with the reason for the
   search.
   8.2.4. Normally, you don't conduct a probable cause search based solely on the statement of one indi-
   vidual. However, if there are reasons why that individual is particularly trustworthy or reliable, the
   search authority may authorize a search. A search authorization request for such searches must detail
   why you consider the person trustworthy or reliable.

8.3. Search Incident to Apprehension. You may conduct a search incident to an apprehension without
obtaining search authority and may include the immediate area over which the apprehended person exer-
cises control. When conducting a search incident to an apprehension, you should conduct it immediately.

8.4. Search With Consent. Security police may conduct a search based on consent to search. If a person
consents to a search of his or her property or person, you do not need search authority. When you obtain
consent to search, the individual giving consent must give it freely and voluntarily. The law does not
require the advisement of Article 31 or Fifth Amendment rights to persons who voluntarily give permis-
sion for a search.
   8.4.1. You may obtain consent orally or in writing. Use AF Form 1364, Consent for Search and Sei-
   zure, to obtain written consent to search.
   8.4.2. The law may require rights advisement before, during, or after requesting or receiving consent
   to a search, depending upon if and when the individual becomes a "suspect" and the particular inves-
   tigative circumstances.
26                                                           AFI31-201_AFRCSUP1_I 16 JUNE 2003


8.5. Search of and by the Opposite Sex. Searching members of the opposite sex and premises occupied
by members of the opposite sex is sensitive. Take certain precautions; carefully consider your actions and
use common sense.
     8.5.1. You may search outer garments (e.g., jackets, coats, etc.) and hand carried items of a member
     of the opposite sex.
     8.5.2. Regardless of the sex of the person being searched, conduct frisks in the same manner. Security
     police or other military persons of the same sex conduct the frisk unless an urgent safety or security
     need exists. Two security police must be present to witness a frisk conducted by the opposite sex.
     8.5.3. You may conduct a search of premises exclusively occupied by members of the opposite sex.
     However, security police or military personnel of the same sex as the occupants of the premises
     should be present during the search.
     8.5.4. You will not conduct body searches of personnel of the opposite sex. If such searches are nec-
     essary, security police or other military persons of the same sex as the person searched will conduct
     the search.

8.6. Personnel Searches. There are four types of personnel searches used within the Air Force. In each
case, the situation determines the type of search.
     8.6.1. Use the standing search primarily for suspects who do not appear dangerous, violent, or so
     drugged or drunk they cannot stand under their own power.
     8.6.2. DELETE
     8.6.3. Use the prone search when a suspect is aggressive or so physically or mentally impaired that
     the standing or kneeling search could cause injury to the suspect. This search is ideal for multiple
     apprehensions and is the primary search used during "high risk" operations.
     8.6.4. Use the complete search, also known as the "strip search" only when placing a person into con-
     finement or when ordered by appropriate authority. Health care providers should supervise complete
     searches.

8.7. Off-Installation Searches. Comply with local, state, and federal law if you need to conduct
off-installation searches of a person subject to the UCMJ, or their property.
     8.7.1. The installation commander approves any requests for such searches. Seek the advice of the
     installation SJA.

8.8. Searches Outside the United States, US Commonwealths, and US Territories. A u t h o r i t y f o r
conducting search and seizure operations outside US federal jurisdiction varies according to geographic
locations and US and host nation agreements. Consult with the local staff judge advocate before conduct-
ing off installation searches conducted outside the United States, US Commonwealths, and US Territories.

8.9. Searches Conducted by Foreign Nationals. Command may not delegate the general authority to
order or to conduct searches to a foreign national. When making a lawful apprehension, host-nation con-
tract security police may search the suspect's person, clothing worn, and the property in the suspect's
immediate possession. Host nation contract security police may also search a motor vehicle that a suspect
AFI31-201_AFRCSUP1_I 16 JUNE 2003                                                                         27


was operating or riding in as a passenger. Host-nation law or US and host-nation agreements govern other
restrictions or authorizations.

8.10. Entry Point Inspections and Searches. Installation commanders may order security police to
inspect all or a percentage of motor vehicles entering or leaving their installation (AFI 31-204, USAF
Traffic Control Program). They may also authorize searches of specific motor vehicles in the same man-
ner as premise searches.

8.11. Preserving Evidence. Preserve all evidence found on a person or at the scene of an offense for use
at future judicial proceedings. Maintain the chain of evidence.
   8.11.1. Record all circumstances surrounding the discovery of evidence (e.g., location of the discov-
   ery, date and time, witnesses present, etc). These notes provide facts for an incident report. Addition-
   ally, you may use these notes to testify in court. As a minimum, file a copy of the notes with the
   incident report. Retain your original notes.
   8.11.2. Place your initials and the date on all evidence for later identification. Use care not to destroy
   the evidentiary value of the item through the careless marking of the item. Use envelopes, boxes,
   plastic bags, etc., to collect evidence. Exercise sound judgment to avoid damaging a valuable stolen
   item that you may eventually return to its owner.
   8.11.3. Security police units must maintain the capability to store evidence. See AFI 31-206, Security
   Police Investigations, for evidence storage guidelines.
   8.11.4. Maintain a complete "chain of custody" accounting of all personnel who handle evidence.
   Use AF Form 52, Evidence Tag, to preserve the chain of custody. In addition to the discovery loca-
   tion, mark the date, time, and initials of the security police person who discovered the evidence. Make
   sure this form contains a complete description of the evidence and the signature of each person han-
   dling the evidence. Annotate the presence of any witnesses.
   8.11.5. Return all evidence items to their rightful owners upon final disposition of a case. Coordinate
   all releases of evidence with the staff judge advocate.

              AIR FORCE LAW ENFORCEMENT TERMINAL SYSTEM (AFLETS)


9.1. Program Definition. AFLETS is an access system to computerized civilian law enforcement data. It
allows the prompt exchange of documented police information between security police and our civilian
counterparts.

9.2. Program Responsibilities. The following agencies and personnel are responsible for various
aspects of the AFLETS program:
     9.2.1. HQ AFSPA/SPLE obtains the originating agency identifiers for each Air Force terminal and
     coordinates (as needed) with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), National Law Enforcement
     Terminal System (NLETS), State Terminal System (STS), and HQ Air Force Office of Special Inves-
     tigations (AFOSI).
     9.2.2. HQ AFOSI is the US Air Force executive agency for National Crime Information Center
     (NCIC) matters.
     9.2.3. MAJCOMs ensure US Air Force installations in the same state, share systems, if practical, and
     fund system acquisition, installation, and support.
     9.2.4. The installation CSP establishes the need for an AFLETS terminal.

9.3. Acquiring and Installing AFLETS. Before acquiring and installing an AFLETS at a base, the
installation CSP:
     9.3.1. Contacts the appropriate state system administrator and coordinates action required to become
     part of the state's system through a dedicated terminal.
     9.3.2. Determines the initial cost of installation to include procurement of power conditioning and
     continuation interfacing equipment (PCCIE).
     9.3.3. Determines recurring costs of terminal equipment.
     9.3.4. Receives PCCIE guidance from the base civil engineer.
     9.3.5. Coordinates local funding for servicing equipment with appropriate base agencies.
     9.3.6. Coordinates with the base contracting officer to develop a service agreement.
     9.3.7. Determines facility protection and environmental requirements to satisfy state requirements for
     terminal installation.
     9.3.8. Furnishes the base civil engineer with the necessary building repairs or modification require-
     ments to accommodate the AFLETS.

9.4. Training. The installation CSP:
     9.4.1. Coordinates and establishes training requirements for local operators with the state terminal
     authorities.
     9.4.2. Ensures training of selected persons in terminal operation.
AFI31-201_AFRCSUP1_I 16 JUNE 2003                                                                       29


   9.4.3. Ensures only trained and qualified persons operate the terminal.
   9.4.4. Documents training records.

9.5. Providing System Protection. Restrict access to data to official use only. Users and serviced agen-
cies follow the state and NCIC guidance on policies, procedures, formats, and codes required for entering
records into the system.

9.6. Criminal History Data. Computerized criminal history (CCH) and interstate identification index
(III) are in a federal system of records and controlled under the Privacy Act of 1974. Grant access to this
data for valid law enforcement purposes on a case-by-case basis.
   9.6.1. The installation CSP may authorize access to CCH and III on a case-by-case basis. Other than
   AFOSI, requests from outside the unit must be in writing, include the reason for the request, and
   require installation CSP approval. Disclose data according to AFI 37-132, The Air Force Privacy Act
   Program. Terminate operations for misuse of terminals.
   9.6.2. Prohibit obtaining the CCH or III data from other sources except as authorized by the installa-
   tion CSP.
   9.6.3. Keep all requests on file for validation purposes. If validation records do not correspond with
   access-approval files, conduct an inquiry to resolve the difference.

9.7. Validation System and Records Maintenance. Validate all AFLETS entries into NCIC, III, or
STS. The FBI or STS sends AFLETS records that require validation to the installation CSP. The installa-
tion CSP establishes a validation system that includes:
   9.7.1. A Security Forces Desk Blotter (AF Form 53) entry or an Incident Report (AF Form 3545) that
   reflects a theft or complaint and prepared by the installation where the offense occurred serves as
   source documents for entries.
   9.7.2. Use a folder for AF Form 1597, Air Force Law Enforcement Terminal System Documenta-
   tion, or NCIC-directed validation document from each agency receiving or using AFLETS service to
   maintain a list of all system entries.
   9.7.3. The installation CSP must select a system terminal manager (STM) to supervise, train on, and
   control terminal operations. The STM uses available documentation to validate entries into the sys-
   tem.

9.8. Agencies Receiving AFLETS Service. Agencies receiving AFLETS service follow the written
requirements and responsibilities provided by the terminal- owning CSP. Written requirements include
training, physical protection, and validations.

                                                 Chapter 10

                                        HIGH RISK SITUATIONS



10.1. Lead Agency Concept. Public Law 93-366 and several National Security Directives (NSDs) out-
line the management of US Government response to high-risk incidents on federal property or terrorist
incidents against US citizens, facilities, and/or interests. These publications identify a lead agency for
coordinating US Government actions to resolve both terrorist and high-risk incidents. Specifically, lead
agency designations include:
     10.1.1. The Department of State (DOS) for terrorist incidents outside US territory.
     10.1.2. The Department of Justice (DOJ) for terrorist and high-risk incidents within US territory.
     Unless otherwise specified by the Attorney General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is the
     lead agency within the DOJ for operational response to such incidents.
     10.1.3. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for aircraft piracy within the special jurisdiction
     of the United States. This special jurisdiction includes all the airspace used for aircraft travel within
     the United States and its territories. The US Government vests the FAA with exclusive responsibility
     for the direction of law enforcement activity during a hijacking involving in-flight aircraft within the
     US. The FBI has jurisdiction when the aircraft is not in flight. If the hijacking occurs overseas, the
     host nation, in conjunction with the DOS and Department of Defense (DoD), manages intervention.
     For further information see AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy (Hijacking).
     10.1.4. The Department of State. The DOS assumes lead agency responsibilities for managing terror-
     ist incidents overseas involving US Government or military affiliated personnel, facilities, and mate-
     rials.
     10.1.5. The Federal Bureau of Investigation. The FBI is the lead US Government agency for investi-
     gating criminal acts committed against US Government offices and employees on US Government
     reservations including military installations or against US Government property. AFOSI is the lead
     Air Force agency responsible for criminal investigations on Air Force installations and serve as liai-
     son with the FBI. The FBI also has the following responsibilities:
        10.1.5.1. Maintains civilian counterterrorist capabilities for response to criminal or terrorist inci-
        dents within the United States, its territories, and its possessions.
        10.1.5.2. Conducts assessments and evaluations of aviation security measures and procedures
        with the FAA.
     10.1.6. The Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA is responsible for domestic airport security
     programs and provides substantial technical and policy advice on US Government international avia-
     tion security efforts. It also provides technical assistance to the international community to improve
     security at international airports serving passengers destined for the United States. The FAA is the
     lead agency for international terrorist incidents involving aircraft in flight. For purposes of assigning
     responsibility in these matters, "flight" begins when support personnel close and secure the aircraft
     door, and the aircraft is no longer dependent on ground service.
AFI31-201_AFRCSUP1_I 16 JUNE 2003                                                                          31


10.2. On-Installation Incidents. Although the DOJ is the lead agency designated for coordinating US
Government actions to resolve terrorist and high-risk criminal incidents, installation commanders have
inherent authority to take reasonably necessary and lawful measures to maintain law and order on instal-
lations and to protect military personnel, facilities, and property. This authority also includes removing or
denying installation access to those individuals who threaten the orderly administration of the installation.
   10.2.1. Role of the Installation Commander. Installation commanders must provide for initial and
   immediate response to any incident occurring on the installation. Additionally, commanders must
   contain damage, protect property and personnel, and restore order. To perform these functions, com-
   manders may order searches and seizures and take other reasonably necessary steps to maintain law
   and order.
   10.2.2. Role of the FBI. The FBI works with and through AFOSI to coordinate criminal investiga-
   tions on Air Force installations. If a service member is not a suspect in the incident, the FBI eventu-
   ally assumes investigative responsibility for the incident and the DoJ will prosecute, if appropriate. At
   what point the FBI assumes operational control of an incident depends on the incident and previously
   executed agreements. Because commanders may never delegate or abrogate ultimate responsibility
   for protecting federal property, commanders may not permit the FBI to assume responsibility for these
   military interests unless directed to do so by competent authority. Commanders must allow the FBI to
   perform its lead role in reacting to terrorist incidents when these military interests are not prejudiced.
   For more information, see DoD 0-2000.12 H, Protection of DoD Personnel and Activities Against
   Acts of Terrorism and Political Turbulence.

10.3. Air Force Philosophy. While installation commanders have the authority to handle certain
high-risk incidents that are criminal in nature (that is, barricaded suspects), the Air Force philosophy is to
fully comply with the lead agency concept by yielding to civilian authorities such as the FBI whenever
possible. The primary Air Force goal in dealing with these high-risk situations is to prevent or minimize
loss of life and property by containment, negotiation, and referral when necessary. Meet this goal best
by working with AFOSI to develop a local memorandum of agreement with the FBI that includes provi-
sions for the FBI's special teams to rehearse and train on the installation.

10.4. Duties and Responsibilities. Resolution of hostage incidents on federal property involves many
agencies and personnel. Installation plans should identify the role of key base agencies in resolution of
high risk incidents. Installation contingency plans must also address the use of security police to isolate,
contain, and neutralize a terrorist or hostage incident, with or without FBI assistance. Contingency plans
should address the use of installation security police, other military forces, and host nation resources.
Installations on foreign soil must coordinate plans with host nation and the State Department (normally
the Regional Security Officer of the US Embassy). In overseas situations, the status of forces or other
agreements and understandings determines the use of host nation resources instead of US forces.
   10.4.1. Secretary of the Air Force Public Affairs. The SAF/PA provides public affairs guidance and
   authorizes local responses to news media inquiries for hostage situations.
   10.4.2. HQ USAF. HQ USAF/XOF and IG develop policies and procedures for hostage situations.
   10.4.3. Installation Commander. Installation commanders:
       10.4.3.1. Prepare contingency plans and maintain a capability to counter hostage situations on
       their installations.
32                                                            AFI31-201_AFRCSUP1_I 16 JUNE 2003


        10.4.3.2. Organize, train, and equip base units to implement the plans.
        10.4.3.3. Maintain responsibility for hostage situations until appropriate authority directs other-
        wise.
        10.4.3.4. Determine the need for hostage negotiators and emergency service teams (EST).
        10.4.3.5. Determine the response time based on the local threat.
        10.4.3.6. Take immediate action as dictated by the situation to prevent loss of life or lessen prop-
        erty damage before the FBI response force arrives. If the FBI declines jurisdiction, the Air Force
        will act to resolve the incident.
     10.4.4. The installation CSP is the primary advisor to the installation commander on hostage negoti-
     ations and EST employment.
     10.4.5. AFOSI Detachment. The servicing AFOSI detachment is the Air Force liaison with all fed-
     eral agencies on criminal investigations and will maintain close coordination with civil authorities to
     exchange information that could indicate a threat to individuals or property on a military installation.
     This office also provides investigative support within its capabilities when needed.
     10.4.6. Local Law Enforcement. The role of state and local law enforcement agencies is much more
     difficult. Each installation establishes unique alliances in the form of jurisdictional agreements. Com-
     manders, staff judge advocates, and chiefs of security police must become familiar with these local
     arrangements and comply with the negotiated policing protocols.

10.5. Off-Installation Incidents. The FBI is the lead federal agency for containing and resolving ter-
rorist incidents occurring off the military installation. AFOSI maintains liaison with the FBI on terrorist
incidents occurring off military installations that may impact Air Force operations. DoD Directive 5525.5,
DoD Cooperation with Civilian Law Enforcement Officials, January 15, 1986, with Change 1, greatly
restricts the use of military forces to enforce civil laws of the US within the territory of the US. However,
if military equipment, property, documents, or personnel are at risk, the commander is ultimately respon-
sible for their protection. For example, in the case of an aircraft crash that occurs outside the confines of
a military installation, the commander has the option of declaring an exclusive zone around the crash site
known as a national defense area (NDA) to support his or her capacity to protect military equipment,
property, documents or personnel.
     10.5.1. National Defense Area (NDA). NDAs contain and secure federal government resources in
     the US and US territorial areas that do not fall under the jurisdiction of the DoD. The Air Force may
     need to establish an NDA if:
        10.5.1.1. Aircraft divert to civilian airports.
        10.5.1.2. An aircraft carrying nuclear weapons makes an emergency landing.
        10.5.1.3. It is necessary to temporarily immobilize nuclear weapons ground convoys.
        10.5.1.4. An aircraft crashes.
        10.5.1.5. Other unplanned emergency occurs.

10.6. Containment Policy. It is both customary and usual for military commanders to assume responsi-
bility for initial response, containment, and resolution of criminal incidents that occur on DoD facilities
AFI31-201_AFRCSUP1_I 16 JUNE 2003                                                                         33


within the US, its territories, and its possessions. In fact, DoD installation military commanders and civil-
ian managers have responsibility and authority for initial response to contain and/or resolve criminal inci-
dents on their installation.
   10.6.1. Investigations. The FBI is the lead agency for investigation and prosecution of alleged viola-
   tions of the US Code (USC) that occur on DoD installations or within DoD facilities. In addition, the
   FBI is the lead agency for investigation and prosecution of individuals alleged to have violated the
   Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986 by committing prohibited acts against
   Americans abroad. Thus, it is the FBI's responsibility to investigate those incidents the installation
   commander declares "terrorist" in nature. AFOSI remains the Air Force liaison with the FBI and
   should be notified any time assistance from the FBI may be required.
   10.6.2. Beyond Containment. Given the FBI's pervasive role in leading the US government's
   response to terrorist incidents, investigation of USC violations, and their investigative role when pro-
   hibited acts are committed abroad, the preferred solution to any high-risk situation is to respond and
   contain the incident until FBI contact is made. Installation commanders may choose to establish and
   train security police as emergency service teams to handle a wide range of high risk situations. If com-
   manders decide to pursue this option, they must seek specialized training from the FBI, local law
   enforcement agencies, or other branches of the service.
       10.6.2.1. US Army Course. The Army's two-week Special Reaction Team (SRT) Course, #
       7H-F17/830-F12, offered numerous times annually at Ft McClellan, provides excellent training
       for teams designed to handle high-risk situations. If units decide to use this course to train their
       emergency service teams, they must comply with Army fitness standards and provide funding for
       attendance by team members. The Army also teaches this course through the use of mobile train-
       ing teams (MTT) that travel to installations requesting such services. This may be the best option
       as these MTTs emphasize training designed specifically for the host installation. The installation
       provides all funding.

                                                Chapter 11

                               EMERGENCY SERVICE TEAMS (EST)


11.1. Requirements for EST. The installation commander may establish and maintain an EST. The
formation of emergency service teams is an optional program established at the discretion of the installa-
tion commander. The basic unit is a four-person security police team acting as a single tactical police
team or in conjunction with other teams during high-risk operations. These include, but are not limited to,
anti-sniper actions, barricaded suspect neutralization, hostage rescue, counterterrorist tactics, and special
event operations. The basic premise for the use of EST is that a tactical team of highly motivated and
well-conditioned police, specially trained and equipped to function as a team, is more effectively and
safely employed than a larger group of security police. The USAF's primary objective in dealing with
high-risk situations is to prevent or minimize the loss of life or property by containment, negotiation, and
yielding to the expertise and unique training of civilian authorities like the FBI and the FAA when possi-
ble.

11.2. Goals. Generally, the goal of any high-risk situation requiring EST employment should include the
release of hostages unharmed, protection of bystanders, prevention of injury to responding forces, appre-
hension of suspects unharmed, and restoration of normal operations. These appear in no certain order and
their prioritization may change depending on the nature of each situation. Tasks associated with initial
response include crisis point and location identification, site isolation, evacuation of nonessential person-
nel, establishment of an inner perimeter, and conducting a reconnaissance and intelligence gathering mis-
sion.

11.3. Capability. Each installation should have the ability to contain potential hostage, sniper, barri-
caded suspect situations, and acts of terrorism, and to provide a standby force to support special events. If
command desires a preselected and highly trained team, assignment to these teams should be voluntary
as units receive no additional manpower for this activity. The volunteer nature of their members often
determines the effectiveness and success of specialized teams. While designed as stand-alone teams,
ESTs must remain capable of teaming up with other teams and element personnel as situations warrant.
Team positions include:
     11.3.1. Team Leader. Responsible for primary direction of the operations and team control during
     deployment.
     11.3.2. Marksman. Provides selected firepower at an individual or location. For obvious reasons,
     this member should possess the sharpest shooting skills and highest level of concentration.
     11.3.3. Point Member. Guides the team's movement during search and clear operations. Acts as the
     reconnaissance component within the search element. Select a quick thinking individual who can
     maintain composure under stressful conditions.
     11.3.4. Defense Member. Provides close protection for the team during movement and deployment.

11.4. Assignment. Units with an assigned EST should ensure that team training is a top priority. Les-
sons learned from high-risk situations like the Waco, TX incident clearly demonstrate the hazards of
employing part-time special operations personnel in a difficult, large scale operation. If feasible, CSPs
AFI31-201_AFRCSUP1_I 16 JUNE 2003                                                                      35


should consider consolidating EST members on a similar daily working element, to promote teamwork
and camaraderie. The more time members spend together, the more effective they will become as an EST.
Additionally, well planned, expertly controlled operations have a better chance to succeed than operations
conceived in an ad hoc fashion by people who may never have worked together.

11.5. Emergency Medical Skills. Planning for a high-risk or tactical mission should obviously include
concern for medical care. Units deciding to establish an EST should also establish a tactical emergency
medical support program.

11.6. Intelligence. One of the recognized basic principles of intelligence is that tactical operations and
intelligence are interdependent. Intelligence does not exist for its own sake, but to assist in executing
operational missions. Develop and nurture the capacity to gather tactical intelligence. Seek assistance
and planning support from your local Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI).

11.7. Interagency Cooperation. Meet regularly with counterparts from other federal agencies. Con-
duct meetings at least annually with federal special operations leaders and command personnel (BATF,
FBI, Marshals Service, and Customs) to discuss tactical analysis and contemporary procedures. Empha-
size the necessity for interagency cooperation and training. Periodically include guest speakers from
civilian law enforcement teams so attendees can share their experience and expertise.

11.8. Employment. Employ the EST as required to resolve situations where loss of life appears immi-
nent. Other considerations include:
   11.8.1. The CSP maintains functional control of emergency service teams. The installation com-
   mander or designated representative directs the decision to assault.
   11.8.2. Don't use specialized teams in conjunction with civil disturbances and protest demonstrations,
   unless intelligence indicates the potential for violence.
   11.8.3. Consider using the EST during open house functions. Keep the EST out of sight until actually
   deployed.

11.9. Uniforms and Equipment. Procure the basic equipment authorized for EST through supply chan-
nels. For standardization, the battle dress uniform (BDU) is the accepted uniform. Use approved equip-
ment listed in TA 538.

11.10. Hostage Negotiation Team (HNT). The principal method to resolve hostage situations is through
negotiation by the HNT. Hostage negotiation is not necessarily a security police-unique responsibility,
but the HNT may include trained security police. Seek local training for negotiators. The US Army offers
the following course at Ft McClellan, Alabama: Hostage Negotiation, # L5AZA3PO72 002, PDS Code
9S0.
   11.10.1. EST Relationship with the HNT. EST members do not participate in or influence negotia-
   tions. They may, however, pass information to the HNT regarding the hostage taker. If you deploy the
   EST, the HNT may assist by creating a diversion.
   11.10.2. Nonnegotiable Demands. Nonnegotiable demands include:
       11.10.2.1. Access or continued access to a nuclear weapon.
36                                                            AFI31-201_AFRCSUP1_I 16 JUNE 2003


        11.10.2.2. Release of inmates.
        11.10.2.3. Weapons, ammunition, or explosives.
        11.10.2.4. Absolute promises of amnesty.
        11.10.2.5. Security police or AFOSI radios.
        11.10.2.6. Tactically significant information.
        11.10.2.7. The exchange of security police, AFOSI, other law enforcement persons, or high-rank-
        ing officials for hostages.
NOTE: Demands for alcohol, narcotics, or other drugs are nonnegotiable unless the demand is reason-
able or for the health of an injured or sick hostage. Because of the dangers involved, avoid the exchange
of any hostages.

11.11. Planning Considerations. Preplanning and coordination with other base agencies are important
to successful resolutions to situations. Preplanning actions include:
     11.11.1. Acquisition of base maps and high-risk structure floor plans.
     11.11.2. Coordination with AFOSI for technical surveillance and other services.
     11.11.3. Coordination with local FBI and law enforcement for special services.
     11.11.4. Coordination with base communications personnel for equipment.
     11.11.5. Coordination with the base civil engineer and civilian utility companies for control of utili-
     ties.

11.12. Initial EST Training. Installation commanders choosing to establish an EST must seek initial
training and certification for all team members. As described in paragraph 10.6.2.1., the Army's SRT
course, either in residence or through the use of an MTT, is an excellent source for initial EST training.
Subjects vary from building entry and tactics to firearms training, trauma aid, operational planning, and
physical conditioning. Installation commanders may also seek this type of specialized training from the
FBI or from local law enforcement.
     11.12.1. Sustainment. The sophistication and perishable nature of skills necessary to perform effec-
     tively within the contemporary tactical environment of high risk situations require allocation of opti-
     mum time for their maintenance. Following a basic training and certification program, each EST
     should train regularly to remain proficient. Suggested training topics include:
        11.12.1.1. Integration of hostage negotiations, EMS, and forward observer (marksman) capabili-
        ties.
        11.12.1.2. Forward observer training--observation and recording skills; establishment of a com-
        mand and control mechanism for forward observer/marksman.
        11.12.1.3. Intelligence operations to include management, analysis, and intelligence support of
        tactical operations.
        11.12.1.4. Performance-oriented team leader/member skills.
        11.12.1.5. Physical fitness.
AFI31-201_AFRCSUP1_I 16 JUNE 2003                                                                      37


       11.12.1.6. Individual and small group training activities to include periodic exercises to hone and
       evaluate preparedness.

11.13. Military Working Dog (MWD) Team Use. If you use MWDs with the EST, they must take part
in normal EST training. Do not use MWDs on an assault when there are hostages or multiple subjects.
Immediately follow any MWD entry with an EST assault. In this situation, the MWD handler must be
EST trained and must remain with the entry team to control the dog.

11.14. Reporting Requirements. Initially report all incidents through OPREP-3 (See AFI 10-601)
reporting channels. The installation CSP provides a security police lessons learned report, as outlined in
Chapter 13, of any actual employment of EST.
   11.14.1. Follow-up Reports. The installation or on-scene commander submits as necessary to keep
   command authorities informed.

                                         CRIME PREVENTION


12.1. Definition. Crime prevention is a pattern of attitudes and behaviors directed both at reducing the
threat of crime and enhancing the sense of safety and security to improve the quality of life in our society
and help develop environments where crime cannot flourish.
     12.1.1. The Air Force Vision. The goal of the Air Force crime prevention program is to eliminate or
     minimize the opportunity and desire to engage in criminal activities. Prevention and elimination of
     crime are quality of life issues, especially considering recent downsizing in the Air Force. Crime pre-
     vention is more than a single focus, law enforcement effort. Effective crime prevention requires inter-
     action among commanders, staff personnel, officers, noncommissioned officers (NCOs), airmen,
     civilian employees, and dependents.

12.2. Objectives. To have an effective program, clearly delineate and widely publicize program objec-
tives. Installation commanders and CSPs may add other objectives to meet local conditions, but the three
principal objectives are:
     12.2.1. Upgrade the protection of personnel and property by educating people to recognize and avoid
     situations in which they are likely to end up the victim of an assault or robbery; encourage the instal-
     lation to install better locks; stress the need for consistent use of existing locks and safeguards.
     12.2.2. Increase surveillance within the Air Force community by encouraging those in charge of
     quarters and residents to challenge unidentified individuals in dormitory and housing areas; establish
     neighborhood watch programs; encourage permanent marking of property.
     12.2.3. Achieve maximum involvement of the Air Force community and security police in crime pre-
     vention activities.
     12.2.4. Acceptance. Voluntary acceptance of the above objective depends on convincing members of
     the base community of the need to protect themselves, their neighborhoods, and work areas by sup-
     porting crime prevention goals.

12.3. The Resources Protection Connection. The Air Force Crime Prevention Program, by design,
complements and works with AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Program. Achieve the
goals of both programs through active participation of the total Air Force community.

12.4. Role of Security Police. The role of security police, though pivotal in effective crime prevention
and resources protection programming, is that of an educational, technical, and supportive resource--an
"enabler or catalyst" rather than a "doer." The primary role of security police law enforcement is that of
preventive patrol, armed response, detection, and investigative services. Security police also provide
equally important technical services such as physical security and resources protection. Obviously, they
need to achieve proficiency in prevention and resources protection programs.
     12.4.1. Program Manager. The Crime Prevention Program is a function of the Police Services
     Branch. The CSF selects an individual to manage resources protection and crime prevention func-
     tions. CSFs focus resources based on the installation’s requirements. The NCOIC, Police Services
AFI31-201_AFRCSUP1_I 16 JUNE 2003                                                                     39


  Branch, should attend course WCIP07A- Resource Protection/Crime Prevention Theory, Practice and
  Management - PDS Code 1F2.
  12.4.2. Considerations. Personnel selected for these positions should possess the ability to communi-
  cate, have the flexibility to work with both young and mature groups, and be willing to work varied
  hours. The person selected to perform crime prevention duties maintains direct communication with
  law enforcement shifts, investigations, and reports and analysis, and should have operations and com-
  mand accessibility.
  12.4.3. Program Responsibilities. The following is a list of the types of crime prevention services the
  crime prevention program manager may choose to provide for the installation:
     12.4.3.1. Establish base-level crime prevention programs. Includes assessing needs, identifying
     problems, establishing objectives, coordinating training, and managing program implementation.
     It further includes providing continuing analysis, program revision, and community-wide crime
     prevention consultation services.
     12.4.3.2. Use criminal statistical data provided by security police reports and analysis to examine
     prevailing crime patterns. Use analyzed data to determine employment of appropriate crime-risk
     management systems as well as short- and long-term crime prevention strategies to counter local
     crime problems.
     12.4.3.3. Provide crime trend data to unit commanders, law enforcement activities, and other
     interested base agencies. Security police use this information to determine selective enforcement
     techniques and element-level crime prevention techniques.
     12.4.3.4. Develop and implement a media campaign to publicize the base crime prevention pro-
     gram, prevailing crime problems, and effective measures to counter these problems.
     12.4.3.5. Conduct and coordinate speaking engagements to promote crime prevention goals. Use
     commander's calls, first sergeant meetings, social activities, youth gatherings, wives' club meet-
     ings, school visitations, etc.
     12.4.3.6. Participate in community projects that foster joint police and community efforts; for
     example, Operation Identification, neighborhood watch, crime stop, and crime hazard reporting.
     Determine the effectiveness of each program.
     12.4.3.7. Conduct citizen awareness programs that educate the military community on the crime
     risks they face. Emphasize specific problems and precautions to protect themselves and their
     property.
     12.4.3.8. Provide crime prevention statistics, rates and trend analysis to members of the Installa-
     tion Security Council (ISC). Implement programs identified by the ISC.
     12.4.3.9. Assist in formulating youth activity programs and selecting volunteers to act as youth
     leaders and advisors in youth programs like the Law Enforcement Explorers. Provide crime pre-
     vention training to youth groups. For example, the Boy Scouts of America recently added a crime
     prevention merit badge that may require assistance from the crime prevention program manager.
     12.4.3.10. Conduct on-base residential, dormitory, and work area crime prevention surveys for
     occupants and organizations requesting such service.
40                                                           AFI31-201_AFRCSUP1_I 16 JUNE 2003


        12.4.3.11. Request and maintain adequate stock of crime prevention literature and forms to ensure
        the continuous availability of material to promote crime prevention programs.
        12.4.3.12. Maintain close liaison with civilian organizations and authorities on crime prevention
        programs. Where possible, set up joint programs to promote military and civilian community
        involvement and combat mutual crime problems. Participate in local, state, and federal crime pre-
        vention activities that benefit the military community.
        12.4.3.13. Encourage unit commanders to establish crime prevention programs within their unit
        and suggest they designate a focal point to coordinate program activities within the unit.

12.5. Basic Programs. As a primary source of information on crime patterns, security police should
provide guidance to the community on prevailing kinds of crime and the specific mode of operation used
by criminals. Each base has its own unique community environment with its own set of crime prevention
needs. For instance, when a base is in a high crime area or has a high crime rate, it should develop an
aggressive program of crime prevention tailored to the situation and environment. There are, however,
some basic programs designed to prevent the most prevalent types of crime occurring on Air Force bases.
These successful programs include:
     12.5.1. Operation Crime Stop. One essential crime prevention program is the prompt and accurate
     reporting of imminent crime situations or criminal acts. Some people will report their observations to
     police only when they know they can remain anonymous. Operation Crime Stop helps overcome
     reluctance to become involved with security police by providing a single telephone line for crime
     reporting while allowing witnesses to remain anonymous.
        12.5.1.1. Install a dedicated Crime Stop telephone, capable of receiving calls from both on and off
        base at the law enforcement desk. Set up a single number dedicated to Crime Stop reporting.
        Advertise the purpose of the dedicated line and the ability to remain anonymous. Distribute Crime
        Stop reporting materials to other unit personnel and encourage their support of the program.
        Bases having on-line access to either 911 or Enhanced 911 (E911 provides automatic caller ID)
        Emergency Reporting Systems may elect to use that system instead.
        12.5.1.2. Log each Crime Stop call on an AF Form 53, Security Police Desk Blotter. Begin each
        entry with "Crime Stop" to aid in statistical retrieval.
     12.5.2. Operation Identification. The Operation Identification program, referred to by the logo
     "OPID", is a crime resistance technique which individuals employ to deter burglaries and larcenies. It
     also provides investigative leads that increase the chances of solving crimes. OPID encourages own-
     ers of high value, theft attractive, or highly pilferable property to permanently mark their property
     with an identifying number. This numbering system provides a means of positively identifying the
     property and to establish ownership if there is theft or loss. Use the social security number plus the
     service prefix (AF) as it is the most flexible and recognizable identifier for worldwide implementa-
     tion.
        12.5.2.1. Mark the property by engraving, etching, or by using fluorescent marking devices. Pho-
        tograph property not easily marked like rings, watches, silverware, etc. Security police should
        maintain one or more electric engravers or other appropriate marking devices at the law enforce-
        ment desk for checkout by interested personnel.
     12.5.3. Crime Hazard Identification Program. One goal of crime prevention is to identify, report, and
     eliminate as many crime hazards as possible, and thus reduce the opportunity for crime. Security
AFI31-201_AFRCSUP1_I 16 JUNE 2003                                                                          41


   police and base-level crime prevention program managers may solicit and issue them to commanders
   and agency chiefs for corrective actions.
       12.5.3.1. Crime Hazard Reminder. Security police should leave crime hazard reminders when
       they discover insecure vehicles, office areas, equipment, or unattended property.
   12.5.4. Citizen Awareness Program. The thrust of this program is to educate the base community
   through the base newspapers and other media about the typical crimes, victims, and offenders. Addi-
   tionally, the installation crime prevention program manager may brief all newly assigned personnel on
   the local crime program with an emphasis on precautions that base personnel should take to avoid
   becoming victims of crime.
       12.5.4.1. Military Working Dogs. The fact MWDs are present on the base is, within itself, a
       deterrent to crime. Articles in the local news media announcing their presence and capabilities
       serve to increase public awareness and acceptance. While media coverage does bolster public
       awareness, you should exercise caution when publishing precise details. For instance, refrain
       from publishing or glorifying seizures by drug detector dog teams as this type of notoriety places
       the handler at risk for retaliation.
   12.5.5. Selective Enforcement. Selective enforcement provides for a more efficient use of manpower
   and lends direction to the prevention of crime and law enforcement activities. The basis for selective
   enforcement is accurate historical data as to time, place, type, and frequency of incidents or violations.
   The crime prevention program manager tabulates information in complaint reports, vehicle accident
   reports, and offense reports. Properly file this data for easy retrieval. Study each complaint or offense
   looking for underlying conditions or acts that usually continue to cause trouble unless corrected. An
   analysis of data accumulated over time should indicate the nature of the enforcement problem and the
   need for selective assignment of security police. Crime prevention program managers provide their
   analysis to the operations flight leadership for patrol activity consideration.
       12.5.5.1. An effective application of selective enforcement is its use in traffic supervision. For
       example, analysis of a series of accidents at an intersection will help determine causes. Perhaps a
       traffic signal, trimming of shrubbery, stop sign, or speed limit reduction sign will help reduce the
       frequency of accidents. Repeated reports of speeding may require a speed measuring device along
       with a marked security police vehicle.
   12.5.6. Physical Protection Surveys. Security police units may establish a program to offer physical
   protection surveys to residents of base housing, dormitories, and to supervisors of activities not nor-
   mally inspected or surveyed under the resources protection program. The purpose of these surveys is
   to educate personnel about the steps they can take to protect themselves and their property. The sur-
   vey is a critical analysis of the physical protection of the quarters, dormitories, or work areas involved.
   Schedule surveys for the requesting individual based on available manpower. Coordinate surveys
   with AFOSI when done as part of the anti-terrorism or Force Protection program. When feasible, the
   crime prevention program manager should consider using law enforcement specialists who normally
   patrol the neighborhood or area to help conduct physical security surveys.

12.6. Situational Crime Prevention. As noted above, the most effective crime prevention programs
address the local crime situation and use local AFOSI expertise in facilities and personnel protection. Not
all the techniques listed above are appropriate for every Air Force base. Consequently, the support group
commander and the chief of security police should analyze their crime problem before deciding which, if
42                                                            AFI31-201_AFRCSUP1_I 16 JUNE 2003


any, of these programs to adopt. It's beyond the scope of this instruction to provide crime prevention strat-
egies for every situation an installation may face.
     12.6.1. The Crime Prevention Coalition. This coalition is a nonpartisan group of more than 120
     national, state, and federal organizations united to encourage action by individuals and groups to pre-
     vent crime. Established in 1980, this coalition provides support for the National Citizens' Crime Pre-
     vention Campaign. The USAF is one of the original members of this broad-based, interdisciplinary
     group whose members represent youth development organizations, municipalities, health care provid-
     ers, law enforcement, and federal and state organizations, to name a few.
     12.6.2. National Crime Prevention Council. (NCPC). Formed in 1982 as a nonprofit organization,
     the NCPC acts as an advocate for crime prevention policies and programs throughout the nation. The
     NCPC works as secretariat to the Crime Prevention Coalition by managing its day-to-day activities.
     Its mission is to enable people to prevent crime and build safer communities. The NCPC is also the
     focal point for the nation's crime prevention efforts. The National Citizens' Crime Prevention Cam-
     paign-symbolized by McGruff and the "Take a Bite Out of Crime" slogan-operates through a unique
     partnership among the NCPC, the Advertising Council, Inc., and the Crime Prevention Coalition.
     NCPC manages the day-today activities of the public service advertising campaign by providing the
     following services to coalition members:
        12.6.2.1. Develops materials, including posters, brochures, and books that help teach crime pre-
        vention skills to citizens of all ages.
        12.6.2.2. Provides information, referral services, and technical assistance to people trying to
        enhance a crime prevention effort.
        12.6.2.3. Conducts training in crime prevention skills and techniques.
        12.6.2.4. Establishes demonstration programs and practical research to find the most effective
        ways to prevent crime.
     12.6.3. NCPC granted authorization to the USAF to reproduce NCPC-copyrighted material. You
     may adopt elements of the national program to meet local needs. For further information, contact the

                             SECURITY POLICE LESSONS LEARNED


13.1. Purpose. The security police lessons learned is a living document striving to capture the experi-
ences of past significant events in the security police career field. Its purpose is to educate and train our
forces. Training and operations planners and leaders at every level can use the examples to focus and
guide programs. Commanders and operations staffs can review them with an eye toward local procedural
policy, both written and unwritten. Element leaders can use them for motivation and training. Most
importantly, the law enforcement and security men and women performing the front line duty can look
inward and reflect on their actions in situations they may potentially face.
   13.1.1. The focus of lessons learned concentrates on the worker level so that they can interpret and
   apply lessons learned directly to the field.

13.2. Categories. Lessons learned is divided into several categories for quick access and retrieval. The
specific sections and a brief description of the types of incidents contained therein include:
   13.2.1. Shooting Incidents. Any peacetime government firearms discharge meeting the reporting
   requirements outlined in AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel. Report all
   instances where security police use deadly force in the performance of their duties.
   13.2.2. Security Incidents. This category includes, but is not limited to security incidents, Helping
   Hand/Covered Wagon incidents, Dull Sword incidents, unlawful entry to aircraft, sabotage or
   attempted sabotage to AF aircraft, any breech of aircraft security, acts of vandalism directed at AF
   priority resources, unauthorized entry into a restricted area, hijacking or attempts, unauthorized entry
   into a launch facility (LF), significant security incidents at AF sponsored air shows, and any damage
   to aircraft.
   13.2.3. Deployments (Actual/Exercise). Examples of lessons learned from previous deployments
   includes: Operation RESTORE HOPE in Somalia, migrant camp operations in Guantanamo and Pan-
   ama, and PROVIDE COMFORT in Turkey.
   13.2.4. Law Enforcement Incidents. Actual employment of EST, regardless of the outcome. Rob-
   beries or attempted robberies, especially if they involve weapons, munitions, or large sums of money.
   13.2.5. Military Corrections Incidents Inmate escapes and inmate disturbances or riots.
   13.2.6. Information/Industrial Security Incidents. Summaries of major espionage cases like the Ald-
   rich Ames case, independent research on insider threats, and substantiated cases of industrial espio-
   nage/sabotage.
   13.2.7. Terrorist Acts. Terrorist attacks at an Air Force base or its resources, bombings/rocket
   attacks, and significant threats from known terrorist groups.
   13.2.8. Civil Disturbances. Protest activity or demonstrations at AF installations, military operations
   other than war (MOOTW), like peacekeeping operations that lead to civil unrest, migrant camp oper-
   ations and disaster relief missions resulting in mass crowd violence or disorder.
   13.2.9. Military Working Dog (MWD) Incidents. All unauthorized bites by MWDs, destruction of
   property by MWDs, training aid losses.

     13.2.10. Combat Arms Training & Maintenance (CAM) Incidents. Unusual training incidents like n
     M-60 "cook-off'" or explosion of blank rounds, unexpected ricochets, and accidental weapons dis-
     charges.
     13.2.11. Miscellaneous. This category provides an avenue for CSPs to analyze and report any inci-
     dent that may be of educational value for the security police career field. Examples of the types of
     incidents previously reported in this section include domestic disturbance/loss of SP weapon, ABD
     training accident/death of SP, injury to an SP while making a DUI apprehension, and SP response to a
     potential suicide.
     13.2.12. Incidents Resulting in Significant Loss of Security Forces Manning. Incidents such as drug
     incidents where 5 or more security forces personnel are involved.

13.3. Reporting Requirements. Security forces commanders analyze significant incidents occurring on
the installation and will provide lessons learned on incidents listed in paragraph 13.2. above, using the
security forces lessons learned format in Attachment 5 of this AFI. Provide the final lessons learned
product within 60 days of the incident to the servicing MAJCOM/SF. MAJCOM police services points of
contact forward a copy of the lessons learned to HQ AFSFC/SFOP within 90 days of the incident.

              USAF SECURITY POLICE MODEL VEHICLE OPERATION POLICY


A2.1. Non-Emergency Operation of Security Police Vehicle. Security Police personnel will:
     A2.1.1. Comply with all installation and state laws when operating USAF-owned or leased vehicles.
     A2.1.2. Use seat belts when operating any vehicle.
     A2.1.3. Ensure their assigned vehicles have sufficient gas and oil for their assigned shift and proper
     inflation of tires.
     A2.1.4. Inspect their assigned vehicles prior to their shift for any damage or missing equipment, and
     inspect the rear seat area for contraband or evidence. You must inspect the rear seat area after trans-
     porting any person.
     A2.1.5. Report all vehicle damage or missing equipment to a supervisor prior to placing the vehicle
     in service.
     A2.1.6. Keep their vehicles clean and free of trash.

A2.2. Emergency Driving -- General (Non-Pursuit Situations). The primary concern in emergency
driving situations is protection of lives and the safety of all citizens and security police personnel. During
emergency driving situations, security police personnel will operate their vehicles with extreme caution
and in compliance with AFI 31-204, Air Force Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision, which requires activat-
ing the emergency light bar and siren. Driving under emergency conditions does not relieve the vehicle
operator from the duty to drive with due regard for safety of all persons, nor will these provisions protect
the driver from consequences of his disregard for safety of others.
     A2.2.1. Emergency Driving Defined. Emergency driving is operation of an authorized emergency
     vehicle (emergency lights and siren in operation) by security police personnel in response to a life
     threatening situation or a violent crime in progress, using due regard for other's safety. Note: Drivers
     should not engage their emergency flashers in an emergency status as it will make turn signals
     inoperative.
     A2.2.2. Emergency Driving Conditions. The decision to drive under emergency conditions rests with
     each individual, based on the following conditions:
        A2.2.2.1. Consider factors such as driving abilities, traffic volume, time of day, and potential haz-
        ard or liability to themselves and the public.
        A2.2.2.2. Make emergency responses only when the call involves a life threatening situation or a
        violent crime in progress.
        A2.2.2.3. Justification to drive under emergency conditions requires availability of sufficient
        information.
        A2.2.2.4. Security police personnel responding to an "officer needs assistance" type call must
        bear in mind that even though a rapid response is important, they must arrive at the scene safely.
AFI31-201_AFRCSUP1_I 16 JUNE 2003                                                                           51


   A2.2.3. Deciding to Make an Emergency Response. When making an emergency response, all per-
   sonnel will immediately notify the desk sergeant of such a decision by using the term "Code Three."
   This will indicate use of emergency lights and siren. The ranking individual on duty will override the
   vehicle operator's decision to make an emergency (Code Three) response if, in his/her judgment, it is
   not warranted or safe. Additionally:
       A2.2.3.1. Security police personnel will not operate a police vehicle in emergency (Code Three)
       status if it is occupied by any passengers other than security police. If security police are transport-
       ing injured personnel to a medical facility, use sound judgment when determining to use an emer-
       gency (Code 3) response.
       A2.2.3.2. Security police vehicles without emergency lights and siren will not make emergency
       (Code Three) responses.

A2.3. Pursuit Driving -- General. The primary concern in pursuit situations is protection of lives and
safety of all citizens and security police personnel. AFI 31-204, Air Force Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervi-
sion, governs operation of emergency vehicles, which authorizes emergency vehicles (with activated
lights and siren) to exceed posted speed limits, but does not relieve the driver of the responsibility to drive
with due regard for safety of all persons. It also does not relieve the driver from the consequence of reck-
less disregard for the safety of others.
   A2.3.1. Pursuit Driving -- Defined. Pursuit driving is an active attempt by security police personnel
   operating an emergency vehicle and using simultaneously all emergency equipment (lights and siren)
   to apprehend one or more occupants of another moving vehicle, when the driver of the fleeing vehicle
   is aware of that attempt and is resisting apprehension by maintaining or increasing his speed, dis-
   obeying traffic laws, ignoring the security police officer, or attempting to elude the officer.
   A2.3.2. Pursuit Driving Policies. The following policies govern vehicular pursuits:
       A2.3.2.1. Use only security police vehicles equipped with emergency lights and siren.
       A2.3.2.2. Use no more than two marked emergency vehicles in the immediate pursuit. Other
       police vehicles will support pursuit units and will not actively engage in the pursuit.
52                                                             AFI31-201_AFRCSUP1_I 16 JUNE 2003

                      SECURITY POLICE RESPONSE AND BREVITY CODES


A3.1. Code 1 (Routine). When a call is not given a priority code, assume it is routine.
     A3.1.1. Respond by observing all applicable traffic laws.
     A3.1.2. Never use emergency lights or siren for any routine call.
     A3.1.3. If you become aware of circumstances unknown to the dispatching agency, you may upgrade
     the response to Code 2 or Code 3. The responsibility for upgrading the call in this fashion rests solely
     with the responding patrol.

A3.2. Code 2 (Urgent).
     A3.2.1. A call requiring an immediate response to a non-life-threatening emergency is normally
     assigned an "urgent" priority.
        A3.2.1.1. Respond by observing all applicable traffic laws.
        A3.2.1.2. Use emergency lights for all urgent calls.
        A3.2.1.3. Sirens are not authorized.
        A3.2.1.4. The urgent call is also known as the "silent response." Use this type of response when
        answering non-life-threatening, crime-in-progress calls.
     A3.2.2. Check local, state, territorial, or host nation traffic codes for limitations on use of lights and
     siren (some traffic codes do not support code 2 responses).

A3.3. Code 3 (Emergency). A call requiring an immediate response to a life-threatening emergency or
in response to an emergency involving Air Force priority resources is normally assigned an "emergency"
priority.
     A3.3.1. The use of emergency lights and siren is mandatory; however, use common sense when
     approaching the scene of the emergency.
     A3.3.2. If the emergency lights and siren put security police, victims, or bystanders in peril, turn them
     off a safe distance from the scene.

A3.4. Code 4 (Request Wants and Warrants). Use this code to obtain an outstanding wants and war-
rants check on a specific person or vehicle. Immediately follow this transmission by listing:
     A3.4.1. The complete name and social security number (SSN) of the person (if known).
     A3.4.2. Or complete vehicle description and license plate number of the vehicle to be checked.
AFI31-201_AFRCSUP1_I 16 JUNE 2003                                                                        53

                 BLOODBORNE PATHOGENS EXPOSURE CONTROL PLAN


A4.1. Bloodborne Pathogens Exposure Control Plan . Each security police unit will develop a blood-
borne pathogen exposure control plan readily available to all unit members. Ensure the plan contains, as
a minimum:
   A4.1.1. The exposure determination of personnel (those reasonably anticipated, as a result of per-
   forming their day-to-day duties, to have skin, eye, mucous membrane, or parenteral contact with
   blood or other potentially infectious fluids or materials). This determination includes:
       A4.1.1.1. A list of all duty positions in which personnel in those positions are likely to be exposed
       to contaminated material.
       A4.1.1.2. A list of all tasks and procedures, or groups of closely related tasks and procedures, in
       which exposure may occur, and performed by personnel who handle contaminated material.
   A4.1.2. The methods available to prevent contact with blood and other potentially infectious fluids or
   materials.
   A4.1.3. Procedures for those who reasonably believe they have contacted a potentially infectious
   fluid or material.
   A4.1.4. Procedures for placing warning labels on containers or plastic bags containing blood or other
   potentially infectious material. Labels must comply with Occupational Safety and Health Agency
   (OSHA) Standard 1910.1030.
   A4.1.5. Procedures for keeping records of all incidents and occupational exposures IAW OSHA Stan-
   dard 1910.1030.
   A4.1.6. Procedures for evaluating circumstances surrounding exposure incidents.

A4.2. Plan Review and Updates . Review the exposure control plan at least annually. Update the plan
as necessary to reflect new or modified exposure determinations.

A4.3. Training. Train security police identified in the exposure determination in the use of protective
equipment and disposition of possibly contaminated materials. Qualified security police or hospital per-
sonnel may conduct this training.

                                    1 JANUARY 1999

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS

This interim change (IC) 99-1 corrects wording concerning off-duty employment of security force mem-
bers as civilian police officers.

6.2.3. Off-duty security force enlisted personnel may serve as members of a civilian police agency, either
as active or reserve duty police officers. While acting as civilian police officers, such personnel act as pri-
vate citizens and not in their official capacity as members of the US armed forces. Commissioned officers
may engage in off-duty employment as guards for a private agency. However, based on the restrictions on
holding civil office imposed by 10 U.S.C § 973, regular commissioned officers, and retired or reserve
officers called to active duty for more than 180 days, may not accept off-duty employment as members of
a federal, state, or local civilian police agency. All off-duty employment of security forces personnel
(officer and enlisted) is subject to approval of their commander and must be coordinated with the servic-
ing legal office.

        IC 99-3 TO AFI 31-201, SECURITY POLICE STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES


28 APRIL 1999


SUMMARY OF REVISIONS


This interim change (IC) 99-3 clarifies guidance previously published in IC 99-1 regarding off-duty
employment of security forces members as civilian police officers.


6.2.3. Off-duty security forces enlisted members may serve as members of a civilian police agency, either
as a regular or reserve duty police officer, provided such service is in their personal capabilities, does not
require the exercise of military authority, and does not interfere with their military duties. Subject to the
same restrictions, commissioned officers may engage in similar off-duty employment, provided they do
not violate the “civil office” restriction found in 10 U.S.C § 973. The restriction provides that regular
commissioned officers, and Guard, Reserve, or retired officers called to active duty for more than 180
days, may not accept off-duty employment as a federal, state, or local civilian law enforcement official in
any position which qualifies as a “civil office”. Guidance on what constitutes a civil office within the
meaning of 10 U.S.C § 973 is contained in AFI 51-902, Political Activities by Members of the U.S. Air
Force. All off-duty employment of security forces personnel (officer and enlisted) is subject to approval
of their commander and must be coordinated with the servicing legal office.

      IC 2001-1 TO AFI 31-201, SECURITY FORCES STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES


4 DECEMBER 2001


SUMMARY OF REVISIONS


This interim change (IC) 2001-1 stipulates changes in reporting lessons learned from HQ Air Force Secu-
rity Police Agency to HQ Air Force Security Forces Center and changes references from security police
to security forces. In addition, it changes the lessons learned requirements and updates references. A
“|”revised material since the last edition.


1.1. Air Force Director of Security Forces (HQ AF/XOF). Develops guidance for all security forces
programs and manages and coordinates security forces equipment programs.


1.2. HQ Air Force Security Forces Center (HQ AFSFC). Provides Air Force commanders with guid-
ance on implementation of security forces programs.


2.5. Corrections. Security forces units administer and operate all Air Force corrections facilities and are
responsible for the security of inmates. This includes facility security, work detail supervision, hospital
prisoner ward security, and transient prisoner security. Security forces personnel perform correc-
tions-related duties.


4.4. Resources and Equipment. HQ AFSFC/SFOR identifies and evaluates commercially available and
government-developed equipment necessary to support service-wide needs for security forces personnel.
SFOR:


4.8.1. As a minimum, mark all security forces vehicles on the driver and front passenger doors (vehicles
marked IAW T.O. 36-1-3 meet this requirement). The markings may be magnetic or permanent-mount
type. Each sign will have “Security Forces” printed in black or ultramarine blue letters on a reflective
white background. Lettering is a minimum of 3 inches in height. Units may use a magnetic 18 inch or
larger security police shield replica instead of the “security forces” sign. 911 or other emergency notifica-
tion procedures may be magnetically or permanently affixed as well.


5.6. Defender Challenge. Defender Challenge is an annual security forces skills competition sponsored
by HQ USAF/XOF. Representative teams from MAJCOMS, ANG, USAFR, United States Air Force
60                                                              AFI31-201_AFRCSUP1_I 16 JUNE 2003


Academy, 11th Wing, and selected allied countries compete in physical endurance, marksmanship and
combat-related events.


7.1.4. For minor offenses, release civilian offenders to their military sponsor. If they do not have a military
sponsor, release them to a relative, friend or on their own recognizance.


7.1.6. Release military personnel to their first sergeant. If the first sergeant is not available, release mili-
tary personnel to their commander. If these individuals are not available, the individual will be released to
an individual who is an E-7/MSgt or above and is at least one grade higher than the individual being
receipted for.


7.6.3.2. DELETE.


7.6.4. Firearms. Security forces routinely bear firearms in the performance of duties. AFI 31-207 contains
specific criterion for their authorization and use. When responding to an incident where security forces
may meet an armed adversary, SF personnel will place their firearm in the ready position. Use realistic
and safe exercises to develop the sound judgment required in situations that may involve the use of deadly
force. Supervisors and exercise participants must follow the safety considerations outlined in AFI 31-207.


8.6.2. DELETE


9.7.1. A Security Forces Desk Blotter (AF Form 53) entry or an Incident Report (AF Form 3545) that
reflects a theft or complaint and prepared by the installation where the offense occurred serves as source
documents for entries.


10.4.2. HQ USAF. HQ USAF/XOF and IG develop policies and procedures for hostage situations.


12.3. The Resources Protection Connection. The Air Force Crime Prevention Program, by design, com-
plements and works with AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Program. Achieve the goals of
both programs through active participation of the total Air Force community.


12.4.1. Program Manager. The Crime Prevention Program is a function of the Police Services Branch.
The CSF selects an individual to manage resources protection and crime prevention functions. CSFs focus
resources based on the installation’s requirements. The NCOIC, Police Services Branch, should attend
course WCIP07A- Resource Protection/Crime Prevention Theory, Practice and Management - PDS Code
1F2.
AFI31-201_AFRCSUP1_I 16 JUNE 2003                                                                           61


12.4.3.8. Provide crime prevention statistics, rates and trend analysis to members of the Installation Secu-
rity Council (ISC). Implement programs identified by the ISC.


13.2.12. Incidents Resulting in Significant Loss of Security Forces Manning. Incidents such as drug inci-
dents where 5 or more security forces personnel are involved.


13.3. Reporting Requirements. Security forces commanders analyze significant incidents occurring on the
installation and will provide lessons learned on incidents listed in paragraph 13.2. above, using the secu-
rity forces lessons learned format in Attachment 5 of this AFI. Provide the final lessons learned product
within 60 days of the incident to the servicing MAJCOM/SF. MAJCOM police services points of contact
forward a copy of the lessons learned to HQ AFSFC/SFOP within 90 days of the incident.


14.2. AF Form 53, Security Forces Desk Blotter. Use this form to record a chronology of security
forces activities during a shift. Security forces blotters often contain sensitive investigative or Privacy Act
information and must be controlled. Restrict distribution of this form (paper and electronic) to the direct
chain of command and key agencies such as AFOSI and SJA. Wing commanders determine who may
receive the blotters; however, at no time should a blotter be distributed below group level.


14.14. AF Form 3545, Incident Report. The use of the AF Form 3545 is mandatory for all incidents
which are reportable under the Defense Incident Based Reporting System (DIBRS). For additional infor-
mation refer to AFI 31-203, Security Forces Management Information System (SFMIS). Use this form to
record facts about an incident or complaint for the proper military authority. Include in the report all avail-
able facts, names of personnel involved and a summary of the initial on-scene investigation. When com-
pleted, send the form to the security forces Administration and Reports Section for processing.
