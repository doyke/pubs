                           OPERATING PROCEDURES AND STANDARDS.

3.1. Airfield Diagram.
     3.1.1. Hickam ramp (Attachment 7) and HNL airport layout (Attachment 8) contain airfield dia-
     grams.

3.2. Airport Operating Area (AOA) Access and emergency removal procedures.
     3.2.1. Any vehicle which requires access to the AOA will be equipped with operational radio equip-
     ment capable of positive two-way contact with HNL Ground Control (Ground 121.9/Tower 118.1)
     and/or Hickam Ramp Facility (133.6) and receive approval from Air Traffic Control (ATC) for access.
     3.2.2. Any vehicle proceeding onto the AOA will be equipped with rotating beacon or emergency
     flashers which is visible for one (1) mile. The use of overhead flashing lights helps to highlight vehi-
     cle’s location and makes it easier to be detected on the airfield. This procedure is required in accor-
     dance with the Honolulu International Airport and Hickam Air Force Base Memorandum of
     Understanding (MOU).
     3.2.3. In the event of radio failure or loss of communication on a runway/taxiway inside the AOA, the
     HNL Ground Control will turn the taxiway lights on and off or use light gun signals to get the vehicle
     operator’s attention. Once alerted, the vehicle operator will immediately exit the area and point the
     vehicle toward the tower and flash his/her headlights to indicate lost radio contact the tower.
     3.2.4. If HNL Ground Control is unable to contact vehicles, they will contact AMOPS for assistance.

3.3. Restricted Areas.
     3.3.1. Restricted areas are identified by a solid red line bounded by a single white line on each side
     painted on the pavement surface, a red rope with stanchions, or both. Entrance is limited to those per-
     sonnel authorized and while displaying an AF Form 1199, USAF Entry Control Credentials Badge.
     Entry/exit into restricted areas can only be made through the Entry Control Points (ECP) unless
     pre-coordinated with SFS. See Attachment 7 for ECP locations.

3.4. Vehicle Parking and Chocking.
     3.4.1. Extreme caution must be used during backing operations around aircraft. Vehicles backing up
     to an aircraft must have chocks in position and a spotter or marshalling assistance during the entire
     maneuver.
     3.4.2. Vehicles will park in a manner to eliminate the possibility of striking an aircraft if it inadvert-
     ently rolls backward or forward. Vehicles will park so that departure from the area can be made with-
     out backing. Servicing vehicles (i.e., fleet service, ambulance bus, fuel trucks, etc., due to their design
     or particular operation) are required to park perpendicular to the aircraft and therefore are exempt.
     3.4.3. The driver must perform the following steps when exiting the vehicle:
        3.4.3.1. Turn off the ignition, set the brakes, and place a manual transmission in reverse or an
        automatic transmission in park, and leave the keys in the ignition.
15AWI13-201 31 JULY 2008                                                                                   15


       3.4.3.2. Use chocks to secure all vehicles and wheeled equipment that does not have an integral
       braking system when left unoccupied on the airfield.
   3.4.4. Aircraft must be chocked and engines shut down on the appropriate side before stair trucks or
   boarding ramps are positioned.
   3.4.5. Vehicles parked within 10 feet of any aircraft will have one rear wheel chocked fore and aft,
   and parking brake will be applied.

3.5. Vehicle Speed Limits. Maximum speed limits for Hickam airfield and Honolulu AOA are:
   3.5.1. Vehicle Parking Area – 5 MPH.
   3.5.2. Aircraft parking ramps for general-purpose vehicles (sedans, vans, buses, etc.) - 15 MPH.
   3.5.3. Frontage/Access road - 15 MPH.
   3.5.4. Taxiways - 25 MPH.
   3.5.5. Runways - There are no speed limits on runways; however, vehicles on the runways will travel
   at speeds that are safe and prudent for conditions.
   3.5.6. Vehicles operating within 25 feet of an aircraft - 5 MPH.
   3.5.7. Maximum towing speed for one piece of aerospace ground equipment (i.e., compressors,
   ground power units, oxygen carts, etc.) - 10 MPH.
   3.5.8. Special-purpose vehicles (tugs, tractors, refueling, stair trucks, etc.) - 10 MPH.

3.6. Jet Blast.
   3.6.1. When aircraft are taxiing or about to taxi with engines running, the vehicle operator will remain
   at least 200 feet from the rear of the aircraft to avoid jet blast. All aircraft parking spots have the
   potential of having jet blast due to the size of aircraft parked there.

3.7. Immediate Vicinity of Aircraft.

  3.14.7. Runway holding position lines are identified with yellow reflective markings. The markings
  consist of four yellow lines- two solid and two dashed spaced 12 inches apart and extended across the
  width of the taxiway. The dashed lines are closer to the runway centerline, and the solid lines are
  always on the side where the aircraft or vehicle is to hold. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
  enhanced hold lines are located on Taxiway Tango, two additional yellow dashed lines are located per-
  pendicular to the existing hold line. Individuals requiring runway access/crossing must stop at this line
  and receive permission prior to proceeding.




     3.14.7.1. The runway holding position markings are located on taxiway Tango 750 feet from Rwy
     08L/26R edge. See Attachment 7 for a depiction of the area.
  3.14.8. Instrument hold lines are indicated by two solid yellow parallel lines with perpendicular lines
  at intervals between (similar to a ladder). These lines are used to stop aircraft and vehicles from inter-
  fering with the signal of the Instrument Landing System (ILS). Vehicles will stop and remain behind
  the instrument hold lines and “ILS” signs and obtain approval from HNL Ground Control during
  instrument flight rules (IFR) weather conditions.




  3.14.9. White “STOP” bar markings are located on all vehicular access roads. Vehicle operators are
  required to stop before entering the access road or taxiway. Conduct a FOD check and look both ways
  before crossing to ensure no aircraft are coming.

     and deposited in a suitable container for disposal. Yield to aircraft and vehicles on the ramp before
     entering the airfield.
     3.16.2. A vehicle returning to the paved surface must pull onto and stop at the extreme edge of the
     paved surface so that all four wheels are on the pavement. Perform a FOD check removing all rocks,
     dirt, etc. that may be in the tires, undercarriage, or wheel wells as much as possible.
     3.16.3. After removing FOD, slowly drive along the extreme shoulder until you are reasonably sure
     all loose FOD has been removed from vehicle and tires.
     3.16.4. Exit the airfield via the shortest authorized route. If FOD was significant, immediately report
     the area where you drove back onto the hard surface and route taken to exit the airfield to airfield man-
     agement. They will inspect the area for FOD and contact a sweeper to sweep the area if necessary.

3.17. Lateral Distance Requirements for Mobile Obstacles on Runways, Taxiways and Aprons.
     3.17.1. All vehicles operating in or around the airfield are considered mobile obstacles. Maintenance
     vehicles and emergency vehicles operating on ramps/aprons and on the AOA have special separation
     standards and are not addressed in this section. Other vehicles operating on the airfield must comply
     with the following:

                 REPORTING, ENFORCING AND VIOLATION CONSEQUENCE.

4.1. Revoking and Reissuing AF IMT 483.
     4.1.1. Unit Commanders, unit ADPMs (for unit-assigned personnel), AM, Wing Safety and SF per-
     sonnel have authority to revoke airfield driving privileges. Runway intrusions or AOA violations will
     result in an automatic 30-day airfield driving privilege suspension. After the 30-day suspension
     period, reinstatement of airfield driving privileges requires complete retraining and a letter of rein-
     statement from the individual’s unit commander.
     4.1.2. The Unit Commander, DAFM and unit ADPM must be notified when an individuals’ airfield
     driving privileges have been revoked.
     4.1.3. Individuals requiring a re-issue of AF IMT 483, Certificate of Competency, due to loss or dam-
     aged form will return the original Airfield Driver’s Training form to Airfield Management for
     re-issue.
        4.1.3.1. If the original documentation cannot be produced, re-training must be accomplished.

4.2. Runway Incursions. A runway incursion is an AOA event that involves the incorrect presence of an
aircraft, vehicle or person on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and take-off of air-
craft.

4.3. AOA Violation Events. An AOA violation is an airfield violation caused by aircraft, vehicles, or
pedestrians entering the AOA without specific HNL Ground Control approval.

4.4. Reporting Procedures.
     4.4.1. When made aware of, or upon notice of, a violation of this instruction, a runway intrusion, or
     AOA violation, the control tower (or any agency/person noticing the violation) will:
        4.4.1.1. Notify AMOPS immediately and direct the individual to report to AMOPs.
        4.4.1.2. If unable to contact the driver either by radio or in person, notify the Security Forces Con-
        trol Center (SFCC). If SF can locate the driver, they will initiate a challenge on the vehicle. If it is
        determined to be a runway incursion or AOA violation, SF will escort the driver to AMOPs (Bldg
        2050) to complete a report. If the driver is unauthorized on the airfield or another security issue is
        witnessed, SF will transport the driver to the SFCC and conduct an investigation.
        4.4.1.3. If Hickam Ramp Facility or HNL Control Tower personnel notice a violation, they will
        notify the AMOPs and document the event in daily logs and tracking forms.
     4.4.2. AMOPs will:
        4.4.2.1. Interview the driver to determine the cause of the event, intended actions, and driver’s
        previous training. Use FAA Form 8020-25, Investigation of Vehicle or Pedestrian Deviation
        Report, while interviewing the driver.
        4.4.2.2. Contact the Hickam Ramp Facility or HNL Control Tower personnel to determine if the
        violation had an adverse impact on flight operations.

Terms
Airfield—The portion of Hickam AFB specially designed for the primary taxi surfaces for aircraft
operations, including aircraft maintenance and support facilities. This includes Taxiways A1-A4, M, T, V,
Taxilanes HA, HB and aprons located on Hickam AFB. Kamakahi road is not considered part of the
airfield.
Airfield Driving Program Manager (ADPM)—The civilian or military individual selected by the
squadron/unit commander to administer the organization’s vehicle program, to include operation of
vehicles on the airfield and associated training.
Airfield Management Operations (AMOPS)—A facility located near the airfield that provides
aircrews with flight plan processing and planning services. This facility is also referred to as Base
Operations.
Airfield Operations Flight Commander (AOF/CC)—Responsible for the overall operation/services
provided by the airfield operations flight in support of the wing flying mission and in compliance with
USAF and FAA guidelines.
Airport Operating Area—The airport operating area is defined as the runway, overruns, and all
taxiways leading to the runway. It is mandatory to possess two-way radio contact with Tower inside this
area.
Apron—A paved surface intended to accommodate aircraft for purposes of loading/unloading, refueling,
parking or maintenance.
Commercial Vehicle—A vehicle, which is owned or leased by a commercial firm, and used in direct
support of AMC airlift operations.
Controlled Area—Any area marked with controlled area signs, usually monitored at controlled entry
points with monitors and indicating official use only.
Controlled Movement Area (CMA)—Any portion of the airfield requiring aircraft, vehicles and
pedestrians to obtain specific Air Traffic Control approval for access. Controlled Movement Areas
include but are not limited to areas used for takeoff, landing and taxiing of aircraft.
38                                                                          15AWI13-201 31 JULY 2008


Emergency Response Vehicles—Government vehicles in response to aircraft or airfield emergencies
using red or blue flashing lights. In response to aircraft or airfield emergencies, these vehicles may enter/
exit the restricted areas at other entry control points. When time permits, operators of these vehicles will
inform Security Forces of intentions prior to crossing restricted area lines.
Foreign Object Debris (FOD)—Any debris on the airfield that can cause damage to an aircraft. A few
examples are tools, plastic packing materials, rocks, discarded parts from maintenance activities, etc. Any
of these objects can shred internal parts if ingested into a jet engine and can become deadly projectiles.
FOD can create an extremely hazardous and costly situation during taxiing, takeoff and landing;
therefore, it is imperative that everyone on the airfield be alert to FOD and removes it immediately.
Government Owned Vehicles (GOVs)—Vehicles that are owned or leased by the US government.
Hickam Ramp Facility—Provides advisory services only to aircraft taxiing to and from Hickam AFB
and monitors aircraft, vehicle and personnel operations on the Hickam airfield non-movement area.
NOTE: Hickam Ramp Facility is not an Air Traffic Control facility.

localizer and glideslope. These signals are critical for aircraft approaching the landing zone.
Negative—No, or permission not granted, or that is not correct.
Non-Movement Area—The non-movement area within the HNL AOA that is not controlled by any air
traffic control agency. Hickam Ramp Facility provides advisory information only to aircraft and vehicles
operating on the non-movement area of Hickam AFB.
Out—The conversation is ended and no response is expected.
Over—My transmission is ended; I expect a response.
Parking Ramp/Apron—Areas where aircraft are parked, loaded and unloaded and serviced between
flights. Vehicles and aircraft operate in close proximity in these areas, so it is vital to maintain a safe
distance between your vehicle and aircraft. Always yield to aircraft and never drive under an aircraft or its
wings. Slow speed and extreme caution are required in these areas.
Privately Owned Vehicle (POVs)—A vehicle that is owned or leased by a private party.
Proceed—Authorization to begin/continue on approved routes.
Ramp—Either concrete or asphalt (depending on the weight of the aircraft and the sub-base of the ground
beneath) used to park aircraft or equipment.
