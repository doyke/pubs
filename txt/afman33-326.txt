                                            Chapter 1

                           COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT

1.1. Formats Unique to Headquarters Air Force (HAF). HAF formats differ from some of
the other types of correspondence prescribed in this manual. These formats are unique to the
HAF and are used for correspondence submitted to the HAF, Office of the Secretary of Defense
(OSD) and the President of the United States, located in the Washington DC area. Prepare all
correspondence submitted for the Secretary , Under Secretary, Chief, Vice Chief and Assistant
Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force action using the formats/process prescribed in Headquarters
United States Air Force (HQ USAF) Operating Instruction (HOI) 33-3, Correspondence
Preparation, Control and Tracking.
1.2. Plain Language. Prepare all Air Force correspondence using plain language. Plain
language saves the Air Force time, effort, and money. Plain language means using logical
organization and common, everyday words, except for necessary technical terms. Prepare
correspondence using the active voice and short sentences.
     1.2.1. Organize your material to help the reader. Identify your audience for the document;
     write to get their attention and anticipate their questions. Consider any additional readers.
     Always start by putting your main message up front. Present information in the succeeding
     paragraphs in a logical order.
     1.2.2. Avoid words and phrases that your readers might not understand. Define each
     abbreviation or acronym the first time you use it. Use the same term consistently to identify
     a specific thought or object. Use words in a way that does not conflict with ordinary or
     accepted usage. Avoid ambiguous phrasing, confusing legal terms, and technical jargon that
     can mislead your reader.
     1.2.3. Use “you” and other pronouns to speak directly to readers (active voice). Do not refer
     to people as if they were inanimate objects. Address the reader as “you.” “You” reinforces
     the message intended for your reader. Use “we” in place of your organization’s name. Be
     careful using “you” if it sounds accusatory or insulting. Instead, put the emphasis on the
     organization by using “we.”
     1.2.4. Active voice is the best way to identify who is responsible for what action. To
     communicate effectively, write the strong majority (around 75%) of your sentences in the
     active voice.
     1.2.5. Short sentences deliver a clear message. Your sentences should average 15 to 20
     words--never make them longer than 40 words. Complex sentences loaded with dependent
     clauses and exceptions confuse the reader by losing the main point in a forest of words.
     Resist the temptation to put everything in one sentence. Break up your idea into its logical
     parts and make each one the subject of its own sentence. Cut out words that are not really
     necessary.
     1.2.6. Check http://www.plainlanguage.gov, for more plain language techniques.
1.3. Writers’ Responsibilities.
     1.3.1. Use this manual when preparing correspondence.
AFMAN33-326 25 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                    5


  1.3.2. Protect and mark any classified information in your correspondence according to
  Department of Defense (DoD_5200.1-R, Information Security Program, and Air Force
  Instruction (AFI) 31-401, Information Security Program Management. Distribute on a need-
  to-know basis. You may also use the following references:
     1.3.2.1. Executive Order 13526, as amended. http://www.archives.gov
     1.3.2.2. Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Special Security Center (SSC)
     Controlled Access Program Coordination Office (CAPCO) Guide to Attachment 3 ( The
     US Air Force follows CAPCO marking guidance)
     1.3.2.3. ECI 5201.02, 1 Aug 2008
  1.3.3. Follow AFI 31-401 if you include “For Official Use Only” information, and refer to
  AFI 33-332, Privacy Act Program, if the Privacy Act applies.
  1.3.4. Check Joint Publication (JP) 1-02, Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and
  Associated Terms, and Air Force Doctrine Document (AFDD) 1-2, Air Force Glossary, for
  correct terms and usage.
  1.3.5. Distribute correspondence on a need-to-know basis.
  1.3.6. Conserve paper. Use backs of scrap paper for drafts and interoffice memos. Consider
  if you can communicate with other means such as a telephone call or electronic mail (E-
  mail). Do not print and mail out correspondence originally sent by E-mail, unless requested.
  Satisfy the minimum distribution requirements only. Utilize two-sided printing whenever
  possible.
  1.3.7. Use the telephone for routine matters. (You can record the inputs on your record copy
  of the final correspondence.)
  1.3.8. Call, use AF Form 74, Communication Status Notice/Request, or E-mail instead of a
  formal memorandum to check the status of an action (see paragraph 8.1.).
  1.3.9. Use caution when highlighting material you copy or microfilm, since highlighters can
  obscure the print.
  1.3.10. Select the appropriate distribution method. Some distribution methods include: E-
  mail, facsimile (FAX), Defense Message System (DMS), United States Postal Service
  (USPS), Base Information Transfer System (BITS), and Defense Courier Service. Consider
  the needs of the recipient when choosing the distribution method. Send computer-generated
  information electronically if the receiver will copy the information into another computer
  system.
  1.3.11. Use E-mail before using FAX, BITS, or USPS. However, do not send classified E-
  mail on a system not authorized for that purpose. When transmitting classified E-mail take
  care to transmit only that level of classified information for which the system is certified and
  accredited. When transmitting sensitive unclassified information by E-mail, apply an
  appropriate level of safeguards to ensure the sensitive, but unclassified, information is
  properly protected. For more information refer to AFI 33-119, Air Force Messaging. When
  delegating an E-mail task, send a courtesy copy (cc) to the originator.
  1.3.12. Follow AFI 33-324, The Information Collections and Reports Management
  Program: Controlling Internal, Public, and Interagency Air Force Information Collections,
 6                                                        AFMAN33-326 25 NOVEMBER 2011


     when licensing internal information reports and collections and/or requesting information
     from the public as required by Public Law (PL) 104-13, The Paperwork Reduction Act of
     1995.
     1.3.13. Avoid abbreviations and military jargon. Write out abbreviations the first time used
     and follow with the abbreviation in parenthesis.
1.4. Suspense Actions.
     1.4.1. Set realistic time limits for answering priority and routine correspondence. Establish a
     suspense (due date) only when you need a reply by a specific date. Notify the action agency
     of the suspense date as early as possible.
     1.4.2. Control suspenses at all offices tasked with answering correspondence. Notify the
     originating agency before the due date if the reply is delayed.
     1.4.3. You may use an automated system or AF Form 388, Communication Control Record
     (see paragraph 8.2.), to control suspense actions.
1.5. Coordination Process.
     1.5.1. Coordinate with offices affected by the proposed action during the draft stage to keep
     from revising the final version.
     1.5.2. Coordinate by telephone or E-mail when possible. Do not indicate coordination in the
     upper right-hand corner since it is used for the file code (see AFMAN 33-363).
     1.5.3. You may coordinate using AF Form1768, Staff Summary Sheet (see paragraph 3.4).
     1.5.4. Remember to coordinate with each office that has a functional interest. Consider the
     chain of command to ensure complete coordination. Schedule enough time to finish review
     and coordination.

                           STATIONERY STANDARDS AND USES

2.1. Paper Standards. Use 8 1/2-inch by 11-inch paper.
   2.1.1. Original. Use white letterhead stationery (printed or computer-generated) for the first
   page of a memorandum, staff study, report, or minutes of a meeting. Use plain white paper
   for continuation pages. (See paragraph 2.4 for computer-generated letterhead.)
   2.1.2. Copies. Use plain white paper for information or courtesy copies.
   2.1.3. Paper Quality. Stationery is produced from recycled paper that has at least 25 percent
   cotton or rag content. The recycled logo is shown in the watermark. Paper quality must not
   exceed the following:

Table 2.1. Paper Quality.
                    Item              Paper Color       Grade        Pounds
                    Letterhead        White             50% rag      16
                                                        or
                                                        25% rag      20


                    Continuation      White             50% rag      16
                                                        or
                                                        25% rag      20

2.2. Standard Letterhead. DoD Instruction (DoDI) 5330.2, Specifications for DoD
Letterheads, establishes the standards for letterheads. There are only two types of letterhead
authorized for use: standard (pre-printed) and computer-generated. Chief master sergeants
(CMSgt) and command chief master sergeants use standard letterhead/stationery. They must use
personal stationary if the CMSgt insignia or symbols are used. Submit any exceptions to the
specified standards through your MAJCOM to SAF/CIO A6 for final determination. ANG
exceptions are approved by individual ANG State Headquarters or the Director, Air National
Guard.
2.3. Pre-printed Letterhead. See Figure 2.1 for an example of letterhead. MAJCOMs may
elect to use generic two-line command letterhead for command-wide use. MAJCOMs may
authorize letterhead below wing-level if the quantity needed justifies the printing cost or other
circumstances warrant. Any unit without its own letterhead uses its parent unit’s letterhead
stationery and identifies its organization and standard office symbol in the FROM caption.
   2.3.1. Ink. Print the letterhead and seal using either reflex blue or black ink.
   2.3.2. Seal. The DoD seal is one inch in diameter. Align the seal 1/2-inch from the upper
   left and top edge of the paper. Do not use any other emblem, decorative device, or
   distinguishing insignia with or in place of the DoD seal.
   2.3.3. Format. Center organization name and address on the letterhead using no more than
   four lines:
 8                                                       AFMAN33-326 25 NOVEMBER 2011


        2.3.3.1. First Line. DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE. Center this line leaving 5/8-
        inch from the top of the sheet. Print it in 12 point uppercase using copperplate letters,
        heavy plate Gothic letters, or equivalent.
        2.3.3.2. Second Line. Center the name of the organization as shown in the G-series
        special order that established it. If G-series orders do not exist, the MAJCOM Director of
        Communications decides the second line.               Put HEADQUARTERS before the
        organization’s name only if it appears in the activation order. Print it in 10.5 point
        uppercase using copperplate letters, heavy plate Gothic letters, or equivalent. If the name
        is more than fifty characters, you may use an additional line.
        2.3.3.3. Third Line. If used, center the location without the ZIP+4 code on this line.
        Print it in 10.5 point uppercase using copperplate letters, heavy plate Gothic letters, or
        equivalent. The bottom of the third line should be 1 1/16 inches from the top of the sheet.
        If your unit is overseas, do not show the Army and Air Force Post Office (APO) or Fleet
        Post Office (FPO) number and a geographical location together. You may use the two-
        letter state abbreviation or spell out the state name. Do not use punctuation in the last
        line of the address element.
EXAMPLES:
                       DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
             HEADQUARTERS AIR EDUCATION AND TRAINING COMMAND


                            DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
                       AIR EDUCATION AND TRAINING COMMAND


                       DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
             HEADQUARTERS AIR EDUCATION AND TRAINING COMMAND
                      RANDOLPH AIR FORCE BASE TEXAS
     2.3.4. Optional Items. Fold marks are guides for judging typing space and for folding the
     paper in three equal parts. Typist guidelines show you are near the 1-inch bottom margin. If
     used, print them in half-point rules (see Figure 2.1).
2.4. Computer-Generated Letterhead. Computer-generated letterhead allows for the use of
plain white bond paper and high production rates. It also permits an organization to generate its
own letterhead stationery.
     2.4.1. Use. You may use computer-generated letterhead the same as printed letterhead when
     the design satisfies all specifications in paragraph 2.3. Use computer-generated letterhead
     only for correspondence within the DoD. Do not use for the signature of the Secretary or
     Deputy Secretary of Defense, or Executive Secretary of the DoD. MAJCOMs may direct the
     use of printed letterhead for headquarters and subordinate units.
     2.4.2. Format. When using computer-generated letterhead, you may identify the office name
     as approved in organizational designation documents. Center the office name below the
     organization name. You may identify the complete mailing address including ZIP+4 code.
     Do not use more than four lines for the letterhead.

2.5. Headquarters United States Air Force (HQ USAF) Letterhead. HQ USAF offices use
this stationery, as do certain field operating agencies (FOA) when their commanders function as
members of HAF.
2.6. Department of Defense (DoD) Programs and Activities Letterhead. When the
Department of the Air Force is the executive agent for DoD-directed programs, the letterhead
format is similar to paragraph 2.3; do not show DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE on the
top line for DoD programs or joint activities. Use this layout instead:
   2.6.1. First line. Print the name of the program as shown in the DoD directive.
   2.6.2. Second and third line. Print the location. For further guidance, contact SAF/A6PP.

personalized letters. Slogans will:
   2.7.1. Represent the mission of the organization.
   2.7.2. Be easy to understand.
   2.7.3. Not be offensive.
   2.7.4. Meet printing specifications (printed approximately 1/2-inch from bottom of page).
2.8. Logograms (Logos). Do not use the Department of the Air Force seal on stationery; the
proper use of the Department of the Air Force seal is covered in Attachment 2. DoDI 5330.2
prohibits use of logos, emblems, decorative devices, or distinguishing insignia on stationery.
OSD grants waivers only for programs of Air Force-wide importance and applicability, such as
the Air Force Fiftieth Anniversary. Send waiver requests to SAF/CIO A6 for staffing to OSD
through the Washington Headquarters Services. Use existing logo stationery until all supplies
are exhausted.

  THE OFFICIAL MEMORANDUM, COMMUNICATION MANAGEMENT FORMS
           AND OTHER TYPES OF WRITTEN COMMUNICATION

3.1. Official Memorandums. See AFH 33-337 for formatting of official memorandums.
3.2. AF Form 74, Communication Status Notice/Request. Use this form to let senders know
the status of their correspondence. You may document comments on the record copy. You may
use the AF Form 74 remarks section for notification of official Air Force business other than
communications status, as authorized by your MAJCOM. You can use the form as a postcard
between activities serviced either by the military distribution system or the USPS.
3.3. AF Form 388, Communication Control Record. Use the AF Form 388 only when you
require formal suspense controls. Use it when you receive correspondence and need to assign
action within your office or to a lower office, or use it to track correspondence requiring a reply
by a specific date. When you use the AF Form 388:
   3.3.1. File the original or a copy by the suspense date and attach all other copies to the
   correspondence.
   3.3.2. Show any extension of the suspense date on the form and refile accordingly.
3.4. AF Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet. Use the AF Form 1768 or a similar electronic
version to summarize staff work, to request action, or to forward information. See AFH 33-337
for more information on filling out the AF Form 1768. Follow local guidance for formatting
electronic versions of the AF Form 1768. Coordination is as follows:
   3.4.1. When you agree with the proposed action, sign your surname, rank or grade, and date
   on the bottom line if you are the addressee; sign on the top line if you are not the addressee.
   3.4.2. When you do not agree with the proposed action, write a memorandum or send an
   official e-mail to the action office stating your reasons. For hard copy AF Form 1768
   coordination, write in ink “See Memorandum” in the signature column of the AF Form 1768
   after your office symbol. Attach your memorandum and return it to the action office. This
   can be accomplished through e-mail if coordinating on an electronic AF Form 1768.
   3.4.3. Try to resolve all differences when you receive a non-concurrence on an AF Form
   1768.
       3.4.3.1. If you cannot resolve the differences, the action officer must write a rebuttal
       memorandum to the approval authority which states differences discussed with the
       nonconcurring official and explains why you cannot change the proposed action. Attach
       the rebuttal memorandum and the non-concurrence memorandum as the last tab to the
       original AF Form 1768, and annotate in pen the additional tab under the list of tabs. Send
       it to the next addressee shown on the AF Form 1768. If coordinating through electronic
       means, attach the differences to the package before forwarding to the approval authority.
       3.4.3.2. If you resolve differences and no changes are made to the AF Form 1768 or to
       any attachments, the previously nonconcurring official shows concurrence by marking
       through the statement “See Memorandum” and signing surname, rank or grade, and date.
 12                                                  AFMAN33-326 25 NOVEMBER 2011


      The action officer annotates “Differences resolved and no changes needed” on the non-
      concurrence memorandum, initials the statement, and attaches this memorandum to the
      record or coordination copy. Route the AF Form 1768 to the next addressee shown on
      the form. If using an electronic AF Form 1768, the nonconcurring official should update
      the electronic staff summary sheet appropriately.
      3.4.3.3. If you resolve your differences and changes are made to the AF Form 1768 or to
      any attachments, the action officer must prepare a new AF Form 1768 and coordinate it
      as a new package with all offices.

Notes:
1. List offices in the order that they should coordinate, approve or sign.
2. Show the action desired in this column (Coord [Coordination], Appr [Approval], Sig
[Signature]). Use Info (Information), when the AF Form 1768 is submitted for information only.
(Note: Usually show only one Appr entry and one Sig entry.)
3. Show coordination or approval with signature and date in the signature column.
4. Enter action officer’s grade and last name.
5. Enter action officer’s office symbol.
6. Enter the action officer’s telephone number.
7. Enter the initials of the typist.
8. Enter the suspense date, if any.
9. Enter subject; use the same subject as for the attached correspondence.
10. Type or stamp date at time of dispatch from the signing official’s office.
11. Number, letter, and space paragraphs the same as the official memorandum.
12. An authority line is not used on an AF Form 1768.
13. Signature is optional. When used, the official signs before coordination. Place the signature
element flush with the left margin as shown.
14. List the correspondence attached. Use blank pages labeled as tabs to separate major groups
of information. Likewise, indicate attachments with labeled pages between the tabs as needed.
Insert documents for signature, approval, or information at Tab 1. Insert any incoming
correspondence, directive, or other paper to which the action officer is responding at Tab 2.
Insert supplementary documents or correspondence at Tab 3, Tab 4, etc.

                                              Chapter 4

                            GUIDE AND FORM MEMORANDUMS

4.1. Guide Memorandums. These are models of a memorandum text composed in advance,
but not printed. They may be complete memorandums with several paragraphs or a single
paragraph. Use guide memorandums to compose official memorandums. Select the
combination of paragraphs appropriate for the reply.
4.2. Form Memorandums. These are mass-produced memos sent in place of individually
composed or typed memorandums when many individuals require similar information or the
same individual requires the information at frequent intervals. These also include standard
formats stored on electronic media that can be accessed, completed with optional data, and then
printed or electronically forwarded.
   4.2.1. Types of Form Memorandums. The three basic formats for form memorandums are
   prewritten, fill-in, and optional statement. Prewritten form memorandums omit the receiver’s
   name, address, and date. Fill-in form memorandums omit any information that varies with
   each response. Optional statement form memorandums provide several options; the writer
   checks the statements that apply to the specific situation. A form memorandum may have
   space for filling in information, selecting one of several statements, or both.
   4.2.2. Form Memorandums Use. Use form memorandums when the subject matter and the
   action are routine or informational, when it is more economical to duplicate the
   memorandum than to type each memorandum individually, and when the printed format
   expedites response from the recipient. Do not use form memorandums if the subject is of a
   personal or congratulatory nature, if it may bring grief, disappointment, or embarrassment to
   the recipient, or if a numbered form would be better.
   4.2.3. Preparing and Controlling Form Memorandums:
           4.2.3.1. Justification. Analyze your correspondence for a 2-week period and group
           memorandums that are similar in meaning and purpose. Count the number of
           individually typed memorandums for each group. A form memorandum is justified if:

Table 4.1. Form Memorandum (Justified).
      The line count (text) of a repetitive        And the number of similar
      memorandum is:                               memorandums written each month is:


      5                                            30 or more
      10                                           15 or more
      15                                           10 or more
Note: Your knowledge operations manager can advise if a numbered form would be more
beneficial.
AFMAN33-326 25 NOVEMBER 2011                                                            15


      4.2.3.2. Composition. Follow the principles of writing in AFH 33-337. Consider the
      memorandum’s impact, especially if it is sent outside the Air Force. If a memorandum
      collects information, review the requirements of the PL 104-13 and AFI 33-324.
      4.2.3.3. Design. Leave enough blank space to complete a fill-in form memorandum.
      Align check boxes () on an optional statement form memorandum.
      4.2.3.4. Signature. Sign form memorandums individually or sign the master before
      reproduction.
      4.2.3.5. Control. Identify each form or guide memorandum by a different symbol if you
      have more than one, e.g. FM-1, FM-2; GM-1, GM-2, etc. You may mark the
      memorandums themselves or their folders. Review the need and currency of the
      memorandum before reproduction, and reproduce no more than a 3-month supply. Not to
      be confused with guidance memorandums/numbering per AFI 33-360 Table 2.1.
4.3. Other Written Communication Types. For other written communications, see AFH 33-
337.

                                           Chapter 5

                                    USE OF ENVELOPES

5.1. General Information. Use standard addresses listed in USPS Publication 28, Postal
Addressing Standards.
5.2. Envelope Size.
   5.2.1. Use a rectangular envelope only slightly larger than the correspondence. Envelopes
   should be no smaller than 3.5 by 5 inches and no larger than 6.125 by 11.5 inches.
   5.2.2. You may use window envelopes. Be sure to adjust the MEMORANDUM FOR
   element to align the address with the envelope window.
   5.2.3. For consolidated mailing, the largest item that cannot be folded determines the
   envelope size (see DoDI 4525.8 /AFSUP).
5.3. Addressing the Envelope. For successful processing by optical character recognition
(OCR) equipment, the USPS requires addresses to be machine-printed, with a uniform left
margin, and formatted in a manner that allows an OCR to recognize the information. Hand
written addresses are acceptable when no other means are available.
   5.3.1. Printing. Use a typewriter or print addresses on a laser printer. You may not hand
   write or use rubber stamps unless laser printers and appropriate software are not available.
   5.3.2. Typeface. Use Courier New font 12 or similar simple sans serif. Be sure characters
   are not too close together and do not touch or overlap. Do not use bold, italic, script, or other
   unusual typefaces.
   5.3.3. Margins. Leave margins at least 0.5-inch from the left and right edges of the envelope
   and at least 0.625-inch from the bottom of the envelope. The last line of the address should
   be no lower than 0.625-inch and no higher than 2.75 inches from the bottom of the envelope.
   5.3.4. Address Format. See Figure 5.1 for address position and format. Use block style with
   a uniform left margin, parallel to the long edge of the envelope. Single-space the address
   block and type the entire addresses in uppercase. Use one or two spaces between words. Do
   not use punctuation in the last two lines of the address block except for the dash in the ZIP+4
   code. Addresses are limited to five lines:
      5.3.4.1. Optional Address Data Line. Use this line for any nonaddress data such as
      account numbers, presort codes, or mail stop codes.
      5.3.4.2. Optional Attention Line. Use this line to direct mail to a specific person.
      5.3.4.3. Organization Abbreviation/Office Symbol Line.               Use the organization
      abbreviation and office symbol separated by a virgule.
      5.3.4.4. Delivery Address Line. Use this line for the street or post office box number,
      and the room or suite number. Use authorized USPS abbreviations found in USPS
      Publication 28. Do not use punctuation on this line. Delivery addresses may be hand
      printed (hand printed, no script) only when no automation or other methods of typing are
      available.
AFMAN33-326 25 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                17


      5.3.4.5. City or Base, State, ZIP+4 Code Line. Use the two-letter state abbreviations
      found in USPS Publication 28. Always include the ZIP+4 code in the address. Do not
      use commas between the city or base, abbreviation, and ZIP+4 code; the dash in the
      ZIP+4 code is the only punctuation used in the last address line. With overseas
      addresses, do not use the APO or FPO number and geographical location together; this
      will cause the mail to enter the international mail channels. Do not type any information
      below or to the right of the city, state, and ZIP+4 code address line.

Figure 5.1. Envelope Address Position and Format.




   5.3.5. Return Address Format. Place the return address in the upper left corner of the
   envelope (see Figure 5.2). Follow the address format (see paragraph 5.3.4). Use the
   complete mailing address. Type “OFFICIAL BUSINESS” beneath the return address (see
   DoDI 4525.8 /AFSUP).

5.4. Machine-Processed Mailing. Limit the thickness of the envelope to 0.25 inch or less when
sealed (about four sheets of bond paper or eight tissue weight sheets). Press envelope to remove
air. Write “nonmachinable” above the address on the envelope if it is more than 0.25 inch thick
(see DoD 4525.8-M/AFSUP).
5.5. Mailing Labels, Cards, and Self-Mailers. See DoD 4525.8-M/AFSUP.
5.6. Preparation and Content of Mail Indicia. See DoD 4525.8-M/AFSUP.
5.7. Preparing Envelopes for Classified Material. See DoD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-401.

       eagle symbolizes the United States and its air power and is depicted in its natural colors.
       The wreath under the eagle is made up of six alternate folds of metal and light blue. This
       repeats the metal and color used in the shield. The white clouds behind the eagle denote
       the start of a new sky.
       A2.2.1.3. The shield, directly below the eagle and wreath, is divided horizontally into
       two parts by a nebular line representing clouds. The top part bears an Air Force yellow
       thunderbolt with flames in natural color that shows striking power through the use of
       aerospace. The thunderbolt consists of an Air Force yellow vertical twist with three
       natural color flames on each end crossing a pair of horizontal wings with eight lightning
       bolts. The background of the top part is light blue representing the sky. The lower part is
       white representing metal silver.
   A2.2.2. The 13 white encircling stars represent the original 13 colonies.
   A2.2.3. The Air Force yellow numerals under the shield are 1947. This is the year the
