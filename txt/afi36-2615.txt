This instruction provides policy guidance to determine, produce, and classify the right number and skill
set of non-rated line officers needed to meet current and future Active Duty Air Force requirements. It
implements AFPD 36-26, Total Force Development, and replaces references to officers in AFI 36-2616,
Trained Personnel Requirements. This instruction pertains to accession sustainment for non-rated line
officer specialties. This AFI is not applicable to members of the Air National Guard and Air Force
Reserve.
This instruction further establishes the processes whereby annual disaggregate non-rated line officer
accession targets are derived from aggregate non-rated line sustainment requirements. Commissioning
and recruiting sources are responsible for compliance with disaggregate mandatory academic degree and
coursework targets and total production, while closely coordinating with HQ AFPC Line Officer Acces-
sions to meet Air Force specialty requirements. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes pre-
scribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 37-123, Management of Records
and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://webrims.amc.af.mil.
Process owners are encouraged to publish supplements, as necessary, to establish internal procedures to
carry out this instruction’s policies and intent.

                                                Chapter 1

                                    GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

1.1. Purpose. The processes used to determine officer accession and training requirements have various
uses. The first is to determine the number required to sustain each career field to accomplish its functional
mission for the Air Force. The second is to provide commissioning sources with stabilized accession
goals to afford ample time to produce officers with the proper education background to meet Air Force
career field sustainment requirements. Third, accession determination processes provide AFPC
Non-Rated Line Officer Accessions with career field-specific requirements, maximizing the opportunity
to project the number of officers that may be assigned to each career field based on Air Force needs and
academic qualifications. Lastly, this process links accession sustainment requirements to programmatic
funding process for initial skills training.

1.2. Aggregate Resource Programming. Determining Air Force accession aggregate and disaggregate
sustainment requirements is the first step in preparing and programming for Air Force accession produc-
tion and training requirements. Programming the accession aggregate is affected by budgetary consider-
ations, projected force structure, and mission changes. HQ USAF/DPLFR determines the accession
aggregate and mix for up to six future fiscal years. This accession mix includes the total number of
enlisted, recall and non-line authorizations, and line officer production. United States Air Force Academy
(USAFA) student inventory will be in accordance with provisions of Title 10, United States Code. Aggre-
gate Headquarters Air Force Officer Accession and Training Schools (AFOATS) accessions allowed to
enter active duty in a particular fiscal year is transmitted via the Line Officer Accession Plan (LOAP)
under signature of HQ USAF/DPL. Changes to the LOAP will not be made within two years of the pro-
duction year, unless fully coordinated with HQ AETC/DO, HQ AETC/XP, HQ AFOATS/CC, HQ AFPC/
CC, HQ AFRS/CC, and other appropriate organizations then approved by HQ USAF/DP.

1.3. Accession Determination. The determination of Non-Rated Line (NRL) officer accession sustain-
ment occurs via the processes outlined in this AFI. Successful accession/recruitment efforts for each pro-
cess are measured when the military member enters active duty.
   1.3.1. The NRL officer sustainment process is based on the sustainment needs of each specialty and
   is determined by weighing the funded manpower authorizations, the number of personnel performing
   duties in the specialty, the number of personnel possessing the core Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC)
   who are working outside the specialty (i.e., special duty, in-residence professional military education
   or graduate school, etc.), the retention within the specialty, and the career field health. Career field
   sustainment needs generate accession requirements. The NRL officer sustainment process designates
   mandatory academic targets, affords commissioning sources ample lead time to produce officers to
   meet accession requirements, determines the acceptable range of accessions by AFSC (bands) for
   future fiscal years, and provides the means to project and classify officer accessions into NRL special-
   ties upon commissioning. New officer accessions are classified into Air Force specialties before com-
   missioning based primarily on Air Force needs and career field requirements, while also taking into
   account the officer’s academic qualifications and career field preferences. Due to the requirement for
   officers to possess an undergraduate academic degree prior to commissioning and mandatory aca-
   demic qualifications for entry into some specialties, accession requirements have a direct relationship
   with the number of persons in certain undergraduate academic degree programs at the commissioning
   sources. Commissioning and recruiting sources must develop programs and processes to comply with
4                                                                      AFI36-2615 11 OCTOBER 2004


    mandatory academic qualifications and total production targets to ensure the appropriate number of
    qualified officer accessions can be classified into appropriate AFSCs. For example, attrition and
    losses to rated programs must be taken into account when determining the right number of officer can-
    didates in each commissioning source. USAFA and Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps
    (AFROTC) will develop programs more than two years out in order to achieve the appropriate NRL
    production levels. Successful accession efforts are measured by comparing the commissioning num-
    bers (by academic degree and commissioning source) and the post-classification numbers (by AFSC)
    to the accession sustainment targets.
       1.3.1.1. The Air Force NRL accession sustainment requirement will be used to program accession
       production targets and will be the basis for programming the accession part of initial skills train-
       ing. For the most part, accession inputs into each AFSC will be centered on the AFSC sustainment
       number; any temporary deviations from that sustainment will be coordinated with HQ AETC/DO,
       HQ AETC/XP, HQ AFOATS/CC, HQ AFPC/CC, and other appropriate organizations, then
       approved and published by HQ USAF/DPL. HQ USAF/DPL will publish bands by AFSC and by
       mandatory academic requirement. Sample bands can be found at Table 1.1. Bands, established by
       analysis, depict color-coded “more than” and “less than” ranges on either side of the sustainment
       requirement for AFSCs and mandatory academic requirements. These bands form the basis for
       measuring accessions. HQ USAF/DPL is the approval level for sustainment numbers and bands
       by AFSC. Banding permits equitable classification and distribution of accessions in times of over-
       age accessions or management of lower than optimum accession production. Banding may also be
       used as a management tool (i.e., metrics).
           1.3.1.1.1. The bands fall into three categories; green, yellow, and red. The green bands (clos-
           est to the sustainment number) form the window for acceptable accession inputs both in aggre-
           gate and in each AFSC. The yellow bands are outside of each green band and fall short of or
           exceed the acceptable accession input. Yellow band production can be offset if limited to one
           or two consecutive years. The red bands are outside of each yellow band and indicate serious
           shortfalls or overages.
           1.3.1.1.2. Every effort will be made to ensure production in each AFSC remains within the
           green band. But in some cases, accession levels outside of the green band may be appropriate.
           HQ USAF/DPL is the yellow band approval level for any programmatic actions within the
           accession process. This includes actions such as adjustments to the LOAP or expected com-
           missioning source production that results in aggregate NRL accession levels outside the green
           band. During classification, HQ AFPC/CC approves adjustments into the yellow bands for any
           forecasted production outside the approved level. HQ USAF/DP approves any programmed
           accessions into the red bands and will be notified if any AFSC is expected to access into either
           the upper or lower red bands during classification. Agencies forwarding notification of yellow
           and red band accession levels will provide background information, as appropriate, and rec-
           ommended course of action coordinated with appropriate action agencies involved up through
           to the approval level provided in the preceding paragraph.
           1.3.1.1.3. The following are some examples where accession levels outside of the green band
           may be appropriate. If a new officer career field is created, the initial accession levels may be
           temporarily in the higher red band. Or, in cases where a commissioning source has the avail-
           ability of excess hard-to-source officer candidates, accession levels may be temporarily raised.
AFI36-2615 11 OCTOBER 2004                                                                             5


         These examples are not all inclusive. Other situations may exist that warrant accession levels
         being set higher or lower than the green band.
         1.3.1.1.4. Color-coded AFSC bands for specialties with mandatory academic qualifications
         (degree and/or course work) for entry form the basis of mandatory academic bands. Sources of
         commission will use the top end of the green band as production targets for AFSCs with man-
         datory academic qualifications.
         1.3.1.1.5. USAFA, AFOATS, and Air Force Recruiting Service (AFRS) will program ade-
         quate resources to meet these mandatory academic production targets for NRL production and
         review progress as necessary.
         1.3.1.1.6. AF/DPLTS, AFOATS, USAFA, AFRS, and AFPC will review predicted production
         up to two years before commissioning and are authorized to adjust production goals between
         the sources of commission and AFRS to best meet production requirements. This may be done
         quarterly or as necessary to give the Air Force the best chance of meeting optimum accession
         targets. The best times may be shortly after cadets declare their degrees or right before AFRS
         selection boards.
  1.3.2. The primary consideration for setting accession production goals will be career field sustain-
  ment requirements. While accessing to meet career field requirements based on career field unique
  characteristics is paramount, end strength cannot be overlooked. However, maintaining stabilized
  accession production and year groups gives the Air Force greater latitude when force shaping is nec-
  essary to meet end strength considerations. Likewise, deliberate employment of the appropriate force
  shaping tools allows the Air Force to access the right number of officers each year, maintaining a
  healthy force structure. Established goals help ensure commissioning sources access officers with the
  requisite education and skills to meet specialty sustainment requirements. When establishing program
  requirements, Air Staff offices should not take actions that cause accession levels to reach unaccept-
  able levels without the appropriate approval as provided in paragraph 1.3.1.1.2. above.
  1.3.3. Commissioning sources shall make every effort to access to active duty the right number of
  qualified officers in accordance with Air Force requirements. While the number of classified acces-
  sions in a given AFSC may fluctuate in and out of the green band throughout the fiscal year, AFPC
  should not allow production to fall outside the acceptable range of accessions in any specialty at the
  end of the fiscal year without prior approval by the appropriate authority as provided in paragraph
  1.3.1.1.2. above. As provided in paragraph 1.3.1.1.2., commissioning sources may recommend acces-
  sion levels outside of the green band; however, they should not make irrevocable commitments until
  after approval. USAFA, AFROTC, and AFRS will ensure long-term programs and strategies are con-
  sistent with projected accession targets including the appropriate distribution of technical production
  requirements between commissioning and recruiting agencies.

        2.4.4.6. AFOATS, in conjunction with the USAFA and AFRS, will monitor academic majors and
        predicted production of cadets in AFROTC’s and USAFA’s senior and junior classes in order to
        provide HQ AFPC/DPPAO production estimates.
            2.4.4.6.1. Commissioning sources and AFRS will review mandatory academic requirement
            shortfalls to align production goals to source of commission most capable to meet any short-
            falls.
            2.4.4.6.2. AFOATS will use AFROTC predicted production to adjust AFRS’ OTS entry
            requirements through HQ AFPC/DPPAO to ensure LOAP line accession production require-
            ment is not exceeded. If the combined AFROTC and OTS production is above or below the

            least 90 days before requested implementation. Air Force needs may allow under/over produc-
            tion in certain technical or non-technical degrees, authorizing AFOATS to produce either
            below or above the LOAP. Non-technical production will not be substituted for technical pro-
            duction without approval from HQ USAF/DPL.
            2.4.4.6.4. Before implementation, AFOATS will coordinate any changes to production esti-
            mates or tasked source of commission with HQ AFPC/DPPAO, HQ AFRS, and HQ USAF/
            DPLTS with courtesy copies to HQ AETC/DOPZ.

                     NON-RATED LINE OFFICER SUSTAINMENT PROCESS

3.1. Purpose. Describe the NRL officer sustainment process.

3.2. Accession Sustainment Model. HQ USAF/DPX-AFPOA generates an accession sustainment plan
that includes disaggregate accession targets. The output will include sustainment numbers and bands by
career field, mandatory academic degree/coursework targets and bands, and proposed distribution and
source of commission targets.
     3.2.1. HQ USAF/DPX-AFPOA provides the accession sustainment plan to HQ USAF/DPLTS.
     3.2.2. HQ USAF/DPLTS reviews proposed accession sustainment and distribution plan and provides
     to HQ USAF/DPLTR, HQ USAF/DPLFR, HQ AFPC/DPPAO, HQ AETC/DOPZ, and Career Field
     Managers.
     3.2.3. HQ USAF/DPLTS, HQ USAF/DPLFR, AF/DPX-AFPOA advises HQ USAF/DPL of any
     LOAP changes, USAFA production changes, or other items that result in NRL officer accession levels
     going outside the green band in order for HQ USAF/DPL to decide whether to maintain levels within
     the green band or not.
     3.2.4. HQ USAF/DPL is approval level for sustainment levels and bands by AFSC.

3.3. Aggregate Accession Goals. HQ USAF/DPLFR publishes the LOAP, which provides HQ AETC/
XP the maximum aggregate AFOATS production allowed to enter active duty in a particular fiscal year.
     3.3.1. HQ USAF/DPLFR coordinates with HQ USAF offices and commissioning sources, as neces-
     sary, to determine the officer accession production numbers.
     3.3.2. HQ USAF/DPLFR determines the LOAP based upon the difference between the AF accession
     sustainment plan and the USAFA production projection.
     3.3.3. HQ USAF/DPLFR advises HQ USAF/DPL of any LOAP production requirements that result
     in NRL officer accession levels going outside of the green band for decision on whether to maintain
     levels within the green band or not.
        3.3.3.1. HQ USAF/DPX-AFPOA supports HQ USAF/DPL with analysis, as necessary, on the
        impacts of accession levels on career field health and sustainment.
        3.3.3.2. LOAPs are not changed within two years of the production year without approval of HQ
        USAF/DP. This restriction is due to the difficulty in adjusting production inside the final two years
        of the production pipeline for AFROTC and the limited ability to change scheduled training.
     3.3.4. HQ AFOATS divides this LOAP target into AFROTC and OTS aggregate targets and provides
     to HQ USAF/DPLFR. As long as changes stay within the AFOATS LOAP and can be provided to
     AFRS at least 90 days before required implementation, HQ AFOATS is authorized to adjust AFROTC
     and OTS share of production during execution to meet AF specialty goals and academic targets.
     3.3.5. HQ USAF/DPLFR provides the aggregate accession goals to HQ USAF/DPLTS and HQ
     USAF/DPLFA.
     3.3.6. HQ USAF/DPLTS provides the aggregate accession goals to HQ USAF/DPX-AFPOA.
AFI36-2615 11 OCTOBER 2004                                                                           15


   3.3.7. USAFA student inventory will be in accordance with provisions of Title 10, United States
   Code.

3.4. NRL Officer Accession Conference. HQ AFPC/DPPAO and HQ USAF/DPLTS co-host the annual
NRLOAC normally scheduled for the first quarter of each FY. NRLOAC participants review sustainment
numbers, accession targets and bands, and production forecasts and estimates. Any changes will be
included in the NRLOAC minutes. Attendees ensure during the NRLOAC that discussions support the
policy provided in AFPD 36-35, United States Air Force Academy.
   3.4.1. Attendees review USAFA and AFROTC mandatory degree production forecasts to determine
   AFRS targets.
   3.4.2. Functional communities and/or career field managers provide input to process agencies on spe-
   cific career field unique characteristics that impact sustainment requirement or accession process.
   3.4.3. HQ USAF/DPX-AFPOA provide the proposed AFSC accession sustainment targets and bands
   to the career field managers or their representatives at least two weeks before the NRLOAC.
   3.4.4. HQ USAF/DPX-AFPOA presents the accession sustainment process and plan at the NRLOAC.
   3.4.5. Commissioning sources will review academic majors and predicted cadet production in
   AFROTC’s and USAFA’s senior and junior classes in order to provide HQ AFPC/DPPAO production
   estimates.
      3.4.5.1. Commissioning sources and AFRS will use the review to refine mandatory academic
      requirement shortfalls to align production goals to source of commission most capable to meet any
      shortfalls. Between NRLOACs, VTCs will be used to review projected production.
      3.4.5.2. To help meet AF sustainment requirements, AFOATS will request AFRS adjust OTS
      entries to offset predicted overages or shortfalls in AFROTC and USAFA predicted production.
      AFOATS will ensure total AFROTC and OTS production remains within the LOAP.
      3.4.5.3. AFOATS will ensure any AFROTC over or under production in either technical or
      non-technical degrees is balanced with a corresponding decrease or increase in OTS technical or
      non-technical production. Air Force needs may allow under/over production in certain technical or
      non-technical degrees, authorizing AFOATS to produce either below or above the LOAP.
      Non-technical production will not be substituted for technical production without approval from
      HQ USAF/DPL.
      3.4.5.4. HQ USAF/DPLFA will consider any accession programs or incentives needed when pro-
      jected production falls short of targets.
      3.4.5.5. HQ USAF/DPLFA will monitor prior service commission opportunities to ensure the
      right mix of officers access each year.
   3.4.6. Review and discuss, as appropriate, other actions to ensure AFSC production targets are met.
      3.4.6.1. Other areas of consideration might include which source of commission is best suited to
      produce technical officers or what is the proper mix of technical production across the sources of
      commission.
   3.4.7. HQ USAF/DPLTS prepares NRLOAC minutes for signature of HQ USAF/DPL. Attached to
   the minutes are the approved mandatory academic requirement bands for compliance by the commis-
16                                                                    AFI36-2615 11 OCTOBER 2004


     sioning sources and AFSC bands/targets for use during AFSC classification actions by HQ AFPC/
     DPPAO. Dispatches minutes to NRLOAC participants.
        3.4.7.1. NRLOAC output products will be made available via windows based system for access
        by NRLOAC participants including Functional Managers, Career Field Managers, Functional
        Area Managers, and Developmental Teams.
        3.4.7.2. HQ AFPC/DPPAO uses OTS targets to develop AFRS goals by AFSC for each OTS
        class.

3.5. Commissioning Sources Execution. Commissioning sources execute programs to motivate cadets
into academic degree programs to meet Air Force NRL officer accession requirements.
     3.5.1. USAFA and HQ AFOATS provide projected production information as required by HQ AFPC/
     DPPAO and HQ USAF/DPLTS for use in preparing metric data.
        3.5.1.1. AFROTC, OTS, and AFRS may provide data directly to HQ AFPC/DPPAO.
     3.5.2. USAFA and AFOATS take actions necessary to access the right kinds and types of officers to
     meet mandatory academic qualification requirements. As mandatory degree and course requirement
     production estimates become firmer, non-technical and AFRS requirements can be solidified. Sources
     of commission, AFRS, and AFPC are encouraged to maintain appropriate contact and make changes
     as needed to ensure total degree and course work targets are realized.
     3.5.3. Commissioning sources may recommend, in some cases, that accession levels be set outside of
     the green band in accordance with paragraph 1.3.1.1.2. One example might be where a commissioning
     source has extra hard-to-source officer candidates. Recommended/approved changes must be coordi-
     nated with HQ AFPC/DPPAO and HQ USAF/DPLTS with a courtesy copy to HQ AETC/DOP.
     3.5.4. Commissioning sources will coordinate any changes to production estimates or tasked source
     of commission with HQ AFPC/DPPAO and HQ USAF/DPLTS with a courtesy copy to HQ AETC/
     DOPZ.
        3.5.4.1. HQ AFPC/DPPAO will check changes against the NRLOAC approved plan, ensure
        changes are within acceptable limits by AFSC, and confirm total source of commission production
        numbers are appropriate.
        3.5.4.2. HQ AFPC/DPPAO will provide updated AFRS entry requirements to match any adjust-
        ments to OTS production targets with at least 90 days notice before required implementation date.
        3.5.4.3. HQ USAF/DPLTS advises HQ USAF/DPLTR, HQ USAF/DPLFR, HQ USAF/
        DPX-AFPOA, and HQ AFPC/DPPAO as needed.
        3.5.4.4. HQ AFPC/DPPAO will interface between HQ USAF/DPLTS, AFRS, and the sources of
        commission.
        3.5.4.5. HQ AETC/DOPZ will check changes against training schedules to ensure training avail-
        ability.

3.6. Program Guidance Letter. HQ USAF/DPLTR prepares the NRL OIS PGLs.
     3.6.1. HQ AFPC/DPPAO determines the projected training requirements for NRL officer career
     fields. The most accurate AFSC distribution projections will be used to size the accession portion of
AFI36-2615 11 OCTOBER 2004                                                                              17


   the training requirement to ensure sufficient training is programmed and available. In absence of accu-
   rate AFSC distribution projections, the sustainment requirements by AFSC will be used.
   3.6.2. HQ USAF/DPLTR uses projected initial skills training requirements and career field sustain-
   ment and distribution plan to prepare the NRL OIS PGLs.

3.7. Monitor Accessions. HQ AFPC/DPPAO monitors execution (production) for the sources of com-
mission by counting the number of expected and actual accessions provided in each specialty.
   3.7.1. Provides appropriate monthly metrics/data to HQ USAF/DPLT and HQ USAF/DPLF.
   3.7.2. When the forecast report predicts accession levels in any specialty to be outside the approved
   band at the end of the fiscal year, HQ AFPC/DPPAO will staff recommended courses of action or
   request for approval along with background information to the appropriate approval authority.
   3.7.3. HQ USAF/DPLFA monitors the aggregate accession program.
   3.7.4. HQ USAF/DPLTS monitors skills accession sustainment and provides quarterly updates to
   CFMs.
   3.7.5. HQ USAF/DPLTR monitors NRL OIS PGL execution through metrics provided by HQ
   AFOSI/DOT and HQ AETC/DOR.

3.8. Classification, Training, and Assignments. HQ AFPC/DPPAO classifies accessions for AFROTC
and OTS, reviews and approves USAFA classification, and schedules initial skills training.
   3.8.1. HQ USAF/DPX-AFPOA provides HQ USAF/DPLTS and HQ AFPC/DPPAO execution year
   classification guidance by specialty based on changes to career field characteristics since the sustain-
   ment plan was published in order to assist in the classification of overage accessions or manage lower
   than optimum accession production.

Terms
Accession—Newly commissioned officer on extended active duty; new enlisted recruit on extended
active duty with no prior military service.
Accession Sustainment Model (ASM)—analytical computer model using sustainment formulas to
generate disaggregate accession targets by mandatory academic category and Air Force specialties for
future fiscal years. These accession targets are reviewed at the NRLOAC and distributed to the
commissioning sources for action. Formerly called the Accession Distribution Model (ADM).
Aggregate—Total number of officers and enlisted personnel in the Air Force inventory; in the NRL
officer sustainment process, aggregate means the total number of NRL officer accession requirements,
calculated by subtracting enlisted, rated and non-line requirements from the Air Force inventory
aggregate.
Banding—The act of designating accession ranges. See Green Band, Yellow Band, and Red Band
definitions.
Career Field Health—Measurement based on whether the career field has the right number of people
with the right skills to accomplish the mission.
Classification —The act of assigning an individual to a specific career specialty.
Cross Flow—Where an officer moves into another AFSC generally for one tour/job and then returns to
their previous AFSC.
Disaggregate—A portion, subset, or derivative of the aggregate number (typically, a specific AFSC).
Eliminee (Elim)—Member who does not complete scheduled training course.
End Strength—For the purpose of this AFI, end strength is the total number of personnel in the Air Force
on active duty.
Green Band—The number of accessions by AFSC and mandatory academic requirement within an
approved acceptable range.
Initial Skills Training (IS or IST)—formal Air Force training for newly accessed officers to teach basic
specialty-specific knowledge; commonly referred to as tech school.
Line of the Air Force (LAF)—For the purpose of this AFI, LAF officers are officers classified into the
following career areas: Operations, Logistics, Support, Acquisition and Financial Management, and
Special Investigations. It does not include officers classified into the Medical career areas (Medical Corps
(MC), Dental Corps (DC), Medical Service Corps (MSC), Biomedical Sciences Corps (BSC), and Nurse
Corps (NC)) and into the Professional career areas (Judge Advocate General Officers (JAG) and Chaplain
(CHAP)). Further clarification of career areas is provided in Air Force Manual 36-2105, Officer
Classification.
Line Officer Accession Plan (LOAP)—Document notifying HQ AETC/XP of the maximum AFOATS
production allowed to enter Active Duty in a particular fiscal year. AFOATS fiscal year-production may
20                                                                     AFI36-2615 11 OCTOBER 2004


differ from AFOATS accessions entering active duty during the same fiscal year due to carry-over from
one fiscal year to another. The LOAP will not be changed within two years of commissioning without HQ
USAF/DP approval due to the difficulty in adjusting production inside the final two years of the
production pipeline for AFROTC and the limited ability to change scheduled training.
Mandatory Academic Requirement—Academic degree or courses required to enter a technical AFSC,
as specified in AFMAN 36-2105, Officer Classification.
Non-line (NL)—As referred to in this AFI, non-line officers are officers classified into the Medical career
areas (Medical Corps (MC), Dental Corps (DC), Medical Service Corps (MSC), Biomedical Sciences
Corps (BSC), and Nurse Corps (NC)) and into the Professional career areas (Judge Advocate General
Officers (JAG) and Chaplain (CHAP)). Further clarification of career areas is provided in Air Force
Manual 36-2105, Officer Classification.
Non-Rated Line (NRL)—Line officers classified into Logistics, Support, Acquisition and Financial
Management, and Special Investigations career areas and into non-rated operations career family areas
(Space, Missile, Command and Control, Intelligence, and Weather utilization fields). Further clarification
of career areas is provided in Air Force Manual 36-2105, Officer Classification.
NRL Officer Accession Sustainment Process—Employs objective modeling to determine NRL officer
accession targets for each AFSC and mandatory academic category, based on the calculated sustainment
requirement for each AFSC. Once the model produces the targets, process agencies validate/revise the
targets during the NRLOAC.
Process agencies—Agencies actively involved in the process to access and classify newly commissioned
officers into NRL specialties and allocate sufficient resources to provide initial skills training for every
new officer requiring such training. These agencies include Headquarters United States Air Force Deputy
Chief of Staff for Personnel (HQ USAF/DPLT and HQ USAF/DPLF), Headquarters Air Force Personnel
Center, Headquarters Air Education and Training Command, Headquarters Air University, Headquarters
2nd Air Force, Headquarters Recruiting Service, Headquarters Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps,
the United States Air Force Academy, and Headquarters Air Force Officer Accession and Training
Schools.
Rated—Pilot, navigator, and air battle manager.
Recore—When the officer moves from one AFSC to a new AFSC and is released from the previous
AFSC with no expectations of returning.
Red Band—Accessions exceeding the upper limit of the acceptable range by a percentage (greater than
the yellow band percentage) based on sustainment or falling short of the lower limit of the same
percentage shall be designated the red band and requires close coordination between process agencies,
career field managers, and functional managers. All AFSC red band accession projections shall require
HQ AFPC/CC and HQ USAF/DPL notification and HQ USAF/DP approval.
Requirement—For the purposes of this AFI, requirement is defined as authorized billets minus assigned
personnel, plus tasked billets drawing personnel from core AFSC positions. Tasked billets include career
broadening and joint assignments, in-residence professional military education, internships outside the
core career field, etc.
Source of Commission (SOC) —Commissioning source. The Air Force commissioning sources are the
United States Air Force Academy (USAF), Officer Training School (OTS), and the Air Force Reserve
Officer Training Corps (AFROTC). In certain circumstances, AFOATS acts on behalf of OTS and
AFI36-2615 11 OCTOBER 2004                                                                            21


AFROTC.
Sustainment—Required number of officers throughout the career field to accomplish the mission.
Accounts for authorized versus assigned billets, retention rates, career broadening and professional
military education assignments drawing officers from core AFSC billets. Calculations for sustainment
incorporate “career field health” considerations.
Technical AFSC—Air Force specialty with mandatory education (undergraduate academic degree or
course) requirements as specified in AFMAN 36-2105, Officer Classification.
Trained Personnel Requirement (TPR)—(1) The number of officer or enlisted personnel programmed
for post-commissioning initial skills training or post-BMT technical training to meet Air Force specialty
requirements and (2) the document containing the number of officer or enlisted personnel programmed for
post-commissioning initial skills training or post-BMT technical training to meet Air Force specialty
requirements.
Yellow Band—Accessions and degrees exceeding the upper limit of the acceptable range by a percentage
based on sustainment or falling short of the lower limit by the same percentage shall be designated the
yellow band and requires coordination among the process agencies, career field managers, and functional
managers. Following coordination, AFSC yellow band accession/degree projections require HQ USAF/
DPL approval/disapproval in the programming phase and HQ AFPC/CC approval/disapproval in the
execution phase. The programming phase occurs as accession levels are programmed for the future at the
Air Staff and the execution phase deals with the current year classifications and distribution at AFPC.
