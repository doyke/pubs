                                      Guidance Changes

(Replace) This supplement prescribes guidance and procedures for all Air Force Materiel
Command (AFMC) organizations and personnel that develop, test, and maintain aerospace
platforms and associated equipment. This publication does not apply to the Air National Guard
Bureau (ANG) and the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and their units. However, if an
AFRC unit is assigned or associated with AFMC, where AFMC is the lead, this guidance would
be applicable to the AFRC unit. Throughout this supplement, the civilian equivalent (unless no
civilian may hold the position) may be applied to any reference to a military rank, grade or
position. All references to aircraft and equipment maintenance in AFI 21-101 and this
supplement are considered aircraft and equipment (i.e. support equipment, test equipment,
special projects equipment, etc.).

Organizations that implement processes that were approved as not applicable or gain those
functions will follow the guidance in AFI 21-101 and AFMC Sup or submit a deviation in the
form of a waiver request. Example, AFI 21-101 Chapter 11 is not applicable to NSOs, however
if they implement processes such as Operating Stock, Shop Stock, and Work Order Residue they
will follow the guidance for those programs in Chapter 11 or submit a deviation.

This supplement is further subdivided as follows: Attachment 13 (Added) – Combat Wing
Organization (CWO), Attachment 14 (Added) – Air Force Sustainment Center (AFSC) Air
Logistics Complexes (ALC)/Depot, and Attachment 15 (Added) – Non Standard Organizations
(NSO).

All chapters of AFI 21-101 apply to CWOs which denotes the standard organizational structure.

With numerous assigned missions within AFMC, that are not organized under the standard
Combat Wing Organization (CWO) concept IAW AFI 38-101, Air Force Organization, the
following AFMC Centers/units require deviations (applicability, variance, and/or differences in
organizational placement of responsibilities/processes) from AFI 21-101 and this supplement.

AFI 21-102 (18 July 2013) Depot Maintenance Management, supersedes the portion of AFI 21-
101 that addresses depot maintenance requirements. Until the publication of an AFMC
supplement to AFI 21-102, the ALCs must continue to follow AFI 21-101 and AFI 21-
101_AFMCSUP1 (Reference memorandum of agreement (09 Nov 12) between HQ AFMC/A4
and AFSC/LG). DEVIATION (DEV) – The following chapters in AFI 21- 101 do not apply to
ALC’s; Chapter 4, Chapter 5, Chapter 6, Chapter 7 (except for AFMC added Chapter 7 in
Attachment 14), Chapter 11 (except for AFMC added Chapter 11 in Attachment 14), Chapter
12, and Chapter 13.

Within AFI 21-101_AFMCSUP_1, references to Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) and
Electronic Systems Center (ESC) are now Air Force Life Cycle Management Center
(AFLCMC); The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) and the Air Armament Center (AAC)
are now the Air Force Test Center (AFTC); The 46th Test Group is now the 96th Test Group.
* The term NSO refers to Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), 66th Air Base
Group (ABG), 88th Air Base Wing (ABW), Crypto and Cyber Systems (HNC), Plant 42, Big
Safari, 645 and 661 Aeronautical Systems Squadron; Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL);
Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC), 377th ABW, 377th Maintenance Group (MXG),
377th Maintenance Squadron (MXS), 898th Munitions Squadron (MUNS), Operating Location-
Ramstein (OL-RAM); Air Force Test Center (AFTC), Arnold Engineering and Development
Complex (AEDC), 96th Test Group (TG); and Air Force Sustainment Center (AFSC), 72nd
ABW, 72nd Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS)/LGRMW, 75 ABW, 649 MUNS, 78 ABW, 78
LRS/LGRW. DEV – The following chapters in AFI 21-101 do not apply to NSO’s; Chapter 4,
Chapter 5 (except PMEL/TMDE functions within Chapter 5), Chapter 6, Chapter 7, Chapter
11, Chapter 13, Chapter 15, Chapter 16 and Chapter 17 (except Chapter 7 and 11 as
applicable applies to AFNWC Nuclear Capabilities Directorate’s Operating Location Ramstein
(OL-RAM), added Chapter 7 in Attachment 14).

* DEV – Deviation to provide/scope applicability for logistics/maintenance Non-Standard
Organizations (NSO) in a stand-alone addendum(s) to the MAJCOM Sup.

The following NSOs policy guidance is published in separate Addendums to this supplement:
DEV – Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) applicability to AFI 21-101 and AFI 21-
101_AFMCSUP1 is very limited, therefore AFRL logistics maintenance management procedures
will be published as a standalone addendum to AFI 21-101_AFMCSUP1 and will only address
applicable areas and the level required based on AFRL missions.

DEV – Policy guidance in this supplement for CPSD was superseded by AFI 21-
101_AFMCSUP1_Addendum_B.

The 583 MMXS Rivet Minuteman Integrated Life Extension (MILE) operations at Malmstrom
AFB MT, Minot AFB ND, and F.E. Warren AFB WY will continue to follow the guidance
outlined in the MOA between HQ AFGSC/A4/7 and HQ AFMC/A4, dated 05 May 12 and 583
Missile Maintenance Squadron GM, 583MMXSGM21-101, dated 29 November 2012, until
formal policy is incorporated into AFI 21-102_AFMCSUP and implementation guidance is
issued by AFSC. Rivet MILE operations at Vandenberg AFB, CA will continue to follow the
guidance in attachment 14 ALC/Depot.

Sustainment Operating Instructions (SOIs) are F-35 joint program instructions provided by the
Joint Program Office (JPO). They are developed with Service/Partner participation and provide
source documentation for Air Force policies/instructions specific to the F-35 where legacy
instructions may not be adequate for the given topic. AFMC units may use SOI source
documentation/information that is relevant and complements AFI 21-101 and AFMC Sup. SOI
requiring a deviation from AFI 21-101 and AFMC Sup requires the unit to submit a waiver.
SOIs may be accessed at the following web site:

                                         Attachment 13

(Add New) 5.10.4. Aircraft Inspection Section. Group/bundle maintenance activities (i.e.
specific tasks) into a flow plan depending on work activity durations and dependencies (i.e.
critical path precedence that establishes predecessor and successor).

(Add New) 7.2.5.3. Upon arrival of the Depot Field Team (DFT), Contract Pre-Induction
Inspection (PII) team, or Depot PII team, PS&D will conduct an initial meeting to validate
maintenance support requirements are in place. Meetings will be documented on an AF IMT
2410, or locally developed product.

(Add New) 7.2.12. Depot Pre-Induction Inspection (PII). PIIs are designed to determine the
aircraft condition lead-time before induction to depot maintenance. Depot teams use the aircraft
condition knowledge to establish a supportable Bill of Work (BOW) process for specific repair
actions, parts, tools, and equipment; i.e., generating what needs to be done, with what, and
ensuring it will be there when planned. PIIs are synchronized with the HSC, Phase, or ISO prior
to depot input on MDS directed by program office. PII can be a physical inspection or a pre-
induction analysis of records. The determination on who will accomplish the PII (Depot Team,
Contract Team, or Field Unit) will be negotiated during the Fleet Scheduling Conferences. At
that time the Depot schedules are established with arrival dates of the aircraft at the respective
Air Logistic Complexes. As part of the conference the PII will be “scheduled” ~9 months prior
to induction to Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM). The MAJCOM/Unit Representative
will declare their intent to accomplish “Organizationally” or request DFT/CFT support for the
PII. If none of these options are feasible at a particular time, any aircraft not receiving a PII
would still be inducted into PDM.

(Add New) 7.2.12.1. If a depot or contract team is accomplishing the PII, the PS&D Section
Chief or designated representative will:

(Add New) 7.2.12.1.2. Be provided a visit agenda by the PII team lead.

(Add New) 7.2.12.1.3. Coordinate with PII team lead to present situational awareness in/out-
brief to the MXG as required.

(Add New) 7.2.12.1.4. Coordinate/request tail number data pull queries from applicable MIS.
(Add New) 7.2.12.1.5. Act as liaison and refer PII team to maintenance units for equipment
support as required.

(Add New) 7.2.12.1.6. Maintain a file copy of the PII report from PII Team Lead.

(Replace) 8.3.31. (Added) As the selecting/hiring official for QA inspector/QAS, QA Chief will
ensure the individual is a qualified subject matter expert (SME) in the functional area (i.e.,
avionics, AGE, aircraft maintenance, fabrication, munitions, etc) the individual will be
evaluating.

(Replace) 8.3.31.1. (Added) QA Chief must ensure civilian QA inspector/QAS civilians have
the prior maintenance experience in the functional area for which the position will be filled. The
QA must include the following knowledge, skills, and abilities:

(Replace) 8.5.1.1. (Added) QA Inspectors will conduct and document evaluations (PE, EPE),
inspections, and process reviews to include as a minimum the requirements in the MSEP.

(Replace) 8.6. Quality Assurance Training. All QAS, inspectors and evaluators (i.e., QA
personnel) must be trained to the extent necessary to perform QA functions to include possessing
sufficient technical knowledge to effectively perform their duties.

(Replace) 8.6.2.1. DELETE

(Replace) 8.6.11. (Added) Training Documentation. All QA personnel must be trained or
possess sufficient technical knowledge to effectively perform their duties. Employee training
will be tracked in the Educational and Training Management System (ETMS) or any other HQ
AFMC/A4 approved system. QA personnel are required to meet minimum qualifications on
certified task being assessed, and must meet any qualification (mandatory formal training)
requirements. The Maintenance Quality Manual or QAP will identify specific technical and/or
weapons systems training requirements.

(Add New) 8.26.1. Meet annually (subject to funding) otherwise by teleconference and phone in
to participate in the monthly telecon.

* (Add New) 14.22.3.2.1.3.1. Aircraft in assigned purpose codes which indicate a status beyond
local repair capability (e.g. BJ, BR, BQ, BU, BK, EB) are excluded from hangar queen reporting,
but are not excluded from local hangar queen management procedures. NOTE: Some assigned
purpose codes per AFI 21-103 require MAJCOM approval prior to use.
(Add New) 14.22.3.2.1.3.2. Aircraft in BJ, BR, BQ, BU, BK, etc., are unit possessed.
Possession is not transferred until depot accepts the TO 00-25-107 request or the aircraft is
accepted by depot field team/contract field team (CFT) (e.g. speedline, TCTO, etc). Units are
exempt from hangar queen reporting for the initial 10 days after regaining possession of the
aircraft upon completion of depot field team/CFT work, or depot authorized local repairs.
Aircraft are removed from hangar queen status when they become airborne on any type of flight.

(Add New) 14.22.3.2.1.3.3. Aircraft permanently assigned and possessed in trainer inactive
code (TX) (Aircraft with a G prefix) are exempt from hangar queen reporting.

(Add New) 14.22.3.2.1.3.4. Aircraft in temporary modification (T-2) (Assigned purpose code
BK) are exempt from hangar queen status, but strict parts and cannibalization management must

AFI 21-101, 26 July 2010, incorporating Change 1, 16 August 2011 is supplemented as
follows: This supplement prescribes guidance and procedures for all Air Force Materiel
Command organizations and personnel that develop, test, and maintain aerospace platforms and
associated equipment. This publication does not apply to the Air National Guard Bureau (ANG)
and the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and their units. However, If an AFRC unit is
assigned or associated with AFMC where AFMC is the lead this guidance would be applicable to
the AFRC unit.
Throughout this supplement, the civilian equivalent (unless no civilian may hold the position)
may be applied to any reference to a military rank, grade or position. With numerous assigned
missions within AFMC, that are not organized under the standard Combat Wing Organization
(CWO) concept IAW AFI 38-101, Air Force Organization, the following AFMC Centers/units
require deviations (applicability, variance, and/or differences in organizational placement of
responsibilities/processes) from AFI 21-101 and this supplement. This supplement is further
subdivided as follows: Attachment 13 (Added) – Combat Wing Organization (CWO),
Attachment 14 (Added) – Air Logistics Centers (ALC)/Depot, and Attachment 15 (Added) –
Non Standard Organizations (NSO). All chapters of AFI 21-101 apply to CWOs which denotes
the standard organizational structure. DEVIATION (DEV) – The following chapters in AFI 21-
2                                           AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012


101 do not apply to ALC’s; Chapter 4, Chapter 5, Chapter 6, Chapter 7 (except for AFMC
added Chapter 7 in Attachment 14), Chapter 11 (except for AFMC added Chapter 11 in
Attachment 14), Chapter 12, Chapter 13 and Chapter 16. DEV – The following chapters in
AFI 21-101 do not apply to NSO’s; Chapter 4, Chapter 5, Chapter 6, Chapter 7, Chapter 11,
Chapter 13, Chapter 15, Chapter 16 and Chapter 17. The term NSO refers to Arnold
Engineering and Development Center (AEDC), Electronic Systems Center (ESC) Cryptologic
Systems Division (CPSD) Technical Applications Products Section (ESC/HNCBM) and
Consolidated Signals Intelligence Support Activity Logistics Section (ESC/HNCBS), Air Force
Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC), Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC), and 46 Test Group
(CPSD is exempt from Chapter 12 and Chapter 18). DEV - Air Force Research Laboratory
(AFRL) applicability to AFI 21-101 and the AFMC Sup is very limited, therefore AFRL
logistics maintenance management procedures will be published as a standalone addendum to the
AFI 21-101 AFMC Sup and will only address applicable areas and the level required based on
AFRL missions. DEV – 581/MMXS Rivet Minuteman Integrated Life Extension (MILE)
operations at Malmstrom AFB, MT; Minot AFB, ND; and F.E. Warren AFB, WY, applicability
to AFI 21-101 and the AFMC Sup is very limited; therefore, Rivet MILE logistics maintenance
procedures will be published as a standalone addendum to the AFI 21-101 AFMC Sup and will
only address applicable areas and the level required based on Rivet MILE missions. All
references to aircraft and equipment maintenance in AFI 21-101 and this supplement are
considered aircraft and equipment (i.e. support equipment, test equipment, special projects
equipment, etc.).
This supplement provides command guidance as directed by AFI 21-101, Aerospace Equipment
Maintenance Management. Units will publish local directives mandated by AFI 21-101 and this
supplement. Waiver authority for this supplement is HQ AFMC/A4. Units developing separate
publications based on requirements set forth in this supplement will follow guidance in AFI 33-
360, Publications and Forms Management. Units supplementing this document will not be
integrated into the AFI or the AFMCSUP; supplements must be “camera ready.”
Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are
maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records and disposed of in
accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule located at

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This publication has been substantially revised and must be reviewed in its entirety. This revision
clarifies significant changes made in the 26 July 2010 edition of AFI 21-101, incorporating
Change 1 dated 16 August 2011. Unique depot procedures and NSO section/chapter
applicability were pulled out of AFI 21-101. Therefore, AFMC Supplement will not be
integrated with parent AFI 21-101 to accommodate the 3 standalone attachments for each of
AFMCs organizational structures within AFI 21-101. Attachment 13 (Added) – Combat Wing
Organization (CWO) adds guidance for Test Wing/Centers. Attachment 14 (Added) – Air
Logistics Centers (ALC) /Depot completely rewritten to clarify policy and procedures for ALC’s
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP               26 APRIL 2012                                            3

depot operations. Attachment 15 (Added) – Non Standard Organizations was revised to define
and add additional guideline for chapters in AFI 21-101 that apply to non-traditional
organizations within AFMC. AFMC/A4’s policy memorandum, GM, and waivers to AFI 21-101
were incorporated into this document. This supplement also incorporates numerous AFMC
command publications to streamline policy processes. Chapters have been consolidated and
renumbered to align with changes implemented in the parent instruction.
NOTE: Deviations are identified throughout this supplement per instruction in AFI 21-101 and
were approved by AF/A4L. Some chapters and paragraphs in this supplement are designated
with applicability statement.

may be parked, stored (AMARG gravel storage areas are not considered flight line), serviced or
maintained and operated under their own power.

Foreign Object (FO)—A substance alien to aircraft, engines, munitions, missiles, drones, space
systems, support equipment, AGE, trainers or components thereof that has been allowed to
invade the product. Any FO in a maintenance area has the potential to cause damage.
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012                                                  11



High Performing Organization—A structured activity or group of activities whose
performance exceeds that of comparable providers at a reasonable cost, whether public or
private. Within the Air Force, the 412 MXG is the only designated HPO.

High Performing Organization (DoD)—A program in the Department of Defense that
designates selected organizations as meeting high performance standards and achieving cost
savings or cost avoidance. In some cases this designation is an alternative to a public-private
competition. Within the Air Force, the 412 MXG is the only designated HPO.

Lea Maintenance Wing – The Lead Maintenance Wing (Lead Center) is assigned to an AFMC
SSQ due to the technical expertise. The Lead maintenance Wing is responsible to arrange for
SME’s tp provide technical guidance as needed and will be the liaison for their assigned SSQ’s.
They will ensure the other Wings (Centers) are involved in all decisions related to their assigned
SSQ’s. The Lead maintenance Wing will coordinate immediate changes to their assigned SSQ’s
with HQ AFMC/A4D.

Level of Effort (LOE) --- A support type project activity which must be done to support other
work activities or the entire project effort. It usually consists of short amounts of work which
must be repeated periodically. LOE is used to define the amount of work performance within a
period of time and is measured in man days or man hours per day/week/month. Examples of
such an activity may be assisting an engineer during pre-test, test, and post test or oiling
machinery during manufacturing, etc. Since a LOE activity is not itself a work item directly
associated with accomplishing the final project product, service or result, but rather one that
supports such work, its duration is based on the duration of the discrete work activity it is
supporting -- oiling machinery will start when manufacturing starts and finish when it finishes.

Maintenance Area—Any area where jet engine, on-equipment aircraft, aircraft assemblies,
subassemblies, munitions, missiles, rockets, and support equipment maintenance operations are
conducted to include hangars, shelters, docks (closed or semi closed), test cell, hush house, paint
barns, fuels barns, back shops, industrial areas, on the flight line or outside maintenance areas
such as wash racks, aprons, hardstands and run pads.

Maintenance Wing Quality Manual—A quality assurance manual provides an organized way
of communicating how quality is managed; defines specific roles and responsibilities and defines
how the organizations quality program is implemented. It provides the basic implementation
guide required at each ALC to ensure all requirements standardized within each Production
Group’s QAP.

Major Finding—Defined as a condition that would endanger personnel, jeopardize equipment
reliability, or warrant discontinuing process or equipment operation.

Management Inspections (MI)—MIs cover a broad category. These inspections are performed
to follow up on trends, conduct investigations, or conduct research to get to the root cause of
problems. Any level of management may request MIs. MIs may encompass PE/QVI trends and
other inspection data, aborts and trends, in-flight emergency trends, high component or system

failure rates, suspected training deficiencies, and tasks outlined in aircraft dash-6 technical
orders.

Minor Finding—Defined as an unsatisfactory condition that requires repair or correction, but
does not endanger personnel, affect safety of flight, jeopardize equipment reliability, or warrant
discontinuing a process or equipment operation.

Non-Release—System malfunction in which a weapon does not release from the delivery
system.

Not In Compliance Areas (NICA)—NICAs are violations or an aggregate of violations to a
particular area of policy which are significant enough to require headquarters assistance and/or
oversight.

Permissive Action Link (PAL)—Device included in or attached to a nuclear weapons system to
preclude arming and launching until insertion of a prescribed discrete code or combination.

Personnel Evaluation (PE)—A PE is an over-the-shoulder evaluation of a PAC certified
mechanic/ technician or team performing a maintenance task.

Preventative Action—Action taken to identify and eliminate the causes of potential
nonconformities (before they occur) or other undesirable potential situations.

Production Acceptance Certification (PAC)—Is a task-related program which ensures
employees are certified to perform and accept completion of assigned work. PAC does this
through systematic training, qualification and certification of individuals.

Quality Assessment Results (QAR) Rating—A numerical value reflecting the results of a
quality assessment. There are two QAR ratings (1 and 3) each based on the number and severity
of defect in the rated area.

Quality Assurance Plan (QAP)—The QAP identifies specific detailed quality processes and
procedures relative to a particular organization. QAPs provide documentation of an
organization’s day-to-day operational procedures.

Quality Assurance Surveillance Plans (QASP)—The QASP identifies the functions and
associated actions performed by a particular organization to ensure that requirements are
performed in accordance with specified standards and that an appropriate level of quality control
activities are in place and operational.

Quality Information Management Standard System (QIMSS)—A data collection system
used to collect and analyze QA data.

Quality Review Board—An assembly of personnel established to review QA findings and
metrics on maintenance wing quality programs.
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012                                                   13

Quality Verification Inspection (QVI)—An assessment/evaluation of a maintenance
procedure, process, product, or portion thereof, while it is being accomplished, or after it has
been completed and the task/WCD stamped.

Repair Network Integration (RNI) – CSAF initiative to develop an enterprise wide repair
capability managed by a single process owner that provides integrated support to the warfighter.
The end goals of RNI are: to be able to rationally manage the entire repair infrastructure;
improve investment decision making; rationally allocate manpower for the repair network;
develop standardized and repeatable management processes; and lower total system costs while
increasing maintenance's ability to respond to changing Air Force requirements with greater
agility and effectiveness.

Routine Inspection List (RIL)—A list of inspection requirements/areas generally designated by
the MAJCOM to be conducted on a recurring basis?

Special Inspections (SI)—SIs are inspections not covered by CI checklists, Management
Inspections, PEs, QVIs, or checklists accomplished as part of the Annual Technical Compliance
Review. SIs can include, but are not limited to, applicable MAJCOM inspection checklists.
Special Inspections when driven by the analysis of assessment data may be conducted at the
discretion of the local QA. However, observed deficiencies beyond those identified as a checklist
question (i.e., stumble on) will be recorded in QIMSS under the category of Special Inspection.
SIs will be assigned a rating (QAR 1, 2 or 3) based on severity of the observation. SIs are
designed to provide a flexible tool to complement other quality assessment types. The
Maintenance Wing Quality Manual or QAP should clearly describe how SIs are conducted as
part of an overall QA program.

Special Process --- Any production or service delivery process that requires continuous
monitoring and control of suitable process parameters and product characteristics during
production, installation, and/or servicing to insure that the specific requirements are met. An
example of controlled parameters and product characteristics are: Time, Temperature, Pressure,
Weight, application of Electrostatics Discharge Control, Critical Dimensions, etc. These
processes shall be carried out by qualified mechanics.

Technical Data—Approved instructions relating to the management, repair, and/or use of a
weapon system or component. Technical data includes, but is not limited to, TOs, Military
Standards/Specifications, engineering drawings, schematic diagrams, flow diagrams,
manufacturer’s handbooks, manuscripts of Operations & Maintenance (O&M), Preliminary
Technical Orders (PTOs), Commercial Technical Manuals (TMs, Research & Development
(R&D) TMs, and other systems or equipment O&M procedures developed under AFMC or other
acquisition agency directions during the systems acquisition phase.

Technical Data Violation (TDV)—An observation of any person performing maintenance
without the proper technical data available and in use.

Unsatisfactory Condition Report (UCR)—A UCR is considered a condition other than a DSV

                         COMBAT WING ORGANIZATION (CWO)

A13.1. (Added) Table A13.1. (Added) prescribes CWO guidance and procedures. The chapters
and paragraph numbers in Table A13.1. coincide with, or add supplemental guidance, and must
be used in conjunction with AFI 21-101. Throughout this Table the civilian equivalent (unless
no civilian may hold the position) may be applied to any reference to a military rank, grade or
position. All chapters of AFI 21-101 apply to CWO’s which denotes the standard organizational
structure.

Table A13.1. (Added) CWO Maintenance Management
                                     CWO

Chapter 1 - MANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY AND POLICY

1.4. Maintenance Concept. The AF requires varying degrees of maintenance capability at
different locations. Maintenance capability depends upon mission requirements, force protection,
economics of repair, transportation limitations, component reliability, workload agreements,
facility requirements, frequency of tasks, and special training required. This capability is
described (in order of increasing capability) as either organizational, intermediate, or depot.

1.4.2. (Added) Organizational - First level of maintenance performed on-equipment (directly on
aircraft or support equipment) at flightline level. This level generally includes repair, inspection,
testing, servicing and/or calibration. Organizational level maintenance is part of the MGN.

1.4.3. (Added) Intermediate - Second level of maintenance performed off-equipment (on
removed component parts or equipment) at backshop level. Primarily testing and repair or
replacement of component parts. This level also includes Centralized Repair Facilities (CRFs).
Intermediate level maintenance is part of the RN. Refer to 1.4.6.

1.4.4. (Added) Depot - Third level of maintenance performed on- or off-equipment at a major
repair facility. Highest level of maintenance for more complex repairs. Depot level maintenance
is part of the RN. Refer to 1.4.6.

1.4.5. (Added) Standard maintenance units and operational test units that possess non-
traditional aircraft maintenance Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSC) such as 3DXXX,
Communications/Electronics Systems career field, who perform maintenance on aircraft or
aircraft support systems, must comply with the requirements identified within this instruction. In
the event of a conflict with other guidance, this instruction will take precedence.

1.4.6. (Added) Repair Network. The MXGs shall support the development and implementation
of the Repair Network Integration (RNI). The Air Force Repair Network is organized into four
hierarchal levels; repair enterprise, product repair groups, repair networks and repair nodes. A
repair network is a collection of repair nodes within product repair groups that support the repair
enterprise. The management of the repair network is comprised of the Repair Network Manager
16                                          AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                   26 APRIL 2012


(RNM) (who may reside in the ALC ASD organization) whose role is to oversee and manage a
collection of repair nodes within a specific product repair group. Node Managers will reside
within the MXG’s for all maintenance managed within the wings.

1.4.6.1. (Added) Repair Node. The Air Force Repair Node level is an individual organizational
unit within repair network(s). The role of the Node Manager is to oversee and manage all shop
activities pertaining to a specific Repair Node. The Node Manager shall:

1.4.6.1.1. (Added) Collect Repair Node Capability and Capacity (CAP2) data. The Node
Manager will also develop Production Plans to support RNM Workload Plans. The Production
Plan shall be provided to the RNM annually and when adjustments are made to the current plan.
The Node Manager will provide the RNM with updates to CAP2 IAW workload allocation plans
and ensure data accuracy.

1.4.6.1.2. (Added) Manage Repair Node operations to support approved performance goals.
The Node Manager shall adjust Repair Node operations as required to meet performance goals.
The Node Manager will communicate production deviations which exceed agreed upon upper or
lower limits to RNM and chain-of-command. The Node Manager will provide mitigation
strategy to address negative performance deviations. The Node Manager will communicate
technical requirement changes via established processes to RNM and engineering as they
become known.

1.4.6.1.3. (Added) Execute Shaping and Sizing actions as defined in the approved Network
Shaping and Sizing Plan as approved by the governance structure. (Shaping and Sizing is a
process for recommending a rational structuring of the Air Force's capability and capacity
(manpower and infrastructure) to ensure an appropriate amount exists based on current and
future mission objectives.)

1.4.6.1.4. (Added) Ensure squadron/group/wing leadership has access to and/or is aware of all
communication exchanges with MAJCOMs and RNMs with regard to RNI processes, CAP2 data
inputs and workload allocation changes/plans.

1.4.6.1.5. (Added) Participate in CPI activities, and share results with RNM.

1.8. Waiver Request. The Wing Commander/Director or Deputy, or equivalent will coordinate
on waiver requests to this instruction. Send waiver requests to
afmc.a4.workflow@wpafb.af.mil (AFMC/A4 Workflow) or mail to HQ AFMC/A4, 4375
Chidlaw Rd, Bldg 262 WPAFB OH 45433-5006.

1.10. Performance-Based Activities. Additional guidance on contract surveillance is provided
in Chapter 18 of this instruction. Units will identify mission essential services and develop the
necessary documents IAW applicable directives.

1.10.3. (Added) Developing Performance-Based Requirements Documents. Performance-based
requirements documents (e.g., Statement of Objectives, Statement of Work, Performance Work
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012                                               17


Statements) focus on desired outcomes and performance standards that communicate what the
contractor is asked to provide. Requirements documents provide desired outcomes, performance
standards, milestones (if appropriate), and metrics which not only measure the contractor's
performance but reflect the management imperatives and initiatives that drive the AF (e.g.,
Mission Capable Rate) and other key efficiency and effectiveness metrics. Requirements
documents do not provide "how to" details that dictate the contractor's organization,
management, personnel development, or approach to completing work. The only exceptions are
safety, environmental management, and security when the contractor operates on a military
installation. Additionally, the contractor is required to follow applicable TOs when performing
maintenance. Unlike MEO and HPO, contractor operations and personnel are not supervised by
government personnel. Any changes to the scope of the work shall be reflected in an official
change to the requirements document, which is provided to the contracting officer for modifi-
cation of the contract.

1.11. Modification Management. Temporary (T-2) Aircraft Modifications will be
accomplished in compliance with AFMC Instruction 21-126, Temporary 2 (T-2) Modification of
Aerospace Vehicles.

1.11.3. (Added) Engineering and maintenance documentation contained in the T-2 Aircraft
Modification data package as defined in AFMC Instruction 21-126, Temporary 2 (T-2)
Modification of Aerospace Vehicles, is the technical data for modified assets.

1.13. Communications. An authorized communication system must be selected with the
capability to effectively support the maintenance communication requirements, including
mobility and host base interoperability IAW AFI 33-200 series publications. Wireless LANs
(WLANs) must comply with all applicable AF 33-series publications. Radios shall be
frequency-programmable.

1.13.1.1. (Added) Use of personal cell phone or communication devices is authorized in the
industrial/production areas except while performing hands-on maintenance activities.
Employees will remove themselves from any maintenance activity, aircraft, or high traffic areas
prior to using a communication device.

1.13.1.2. (Added) Use of portable music/video players (boom boxes, stereos and other sizable
devices), electronic games or other personal electronic hearing impairing devices is authorized in
industrial production areas except where audio warning cues are used.

1.13.1.4. (Added) Contractor issued electronic and communication devices will follow the same
guidance as official government issued electronic and communication devices.

1.13.2. MXG/CC, Civilian Leader (CL), Civilian Director (CD), or equivalent must develop
communication plans IAW AFI 21-101 showing current needs, how they are satisfied, and the
maintenance programming for future needs.

DEV 1.15. Maintenance Training. Within the TW, the MXG/CC will determine which Lead
Command courses are mandatory for members assigned to multiple airframes.

1.22. (Added) Maintenance Management Metrics. Metrics provide a measurement of
performance and capability. Leaders, supervisors and technicians must have accurate and
reliable information to make decisions. Primary concerns of maintenance managers are how
well the unit is meeting mission requirements, how to improve equipment performance,
identifying emerging support problems, and projecting future trends. Maintenance management
metrics—sometimes called “health of fleet” indicators—are a crucial form of information used
by maintenance leaders to improve the performance of maintenance organizations, equipment
and people when compared with established goals and standards. Metrics often take the form of
an “MC Rate” line chart or a “Dashboard” presenting a gauge of an organization’s effectiveness
and efficiency. Properly used, metrics create a roadmap that helps determine where the unit has
been, where the unit should be, and how the unit will get there.

1.22.1. (Added) The overarching objective of AF maintenance is to maintain aircraft and
equipment in a safe, serviceable and ready condition to meet mission needs. Maintenance
management metrics serve this overarching objective and shall be established or maintained by
Headquarters AF, Major Commands, Wings and/or Squadrons to evaluate/improve equipment
condition, personnel skills and long-term fleet health. Metrics shall be used at all levels of
command to drive improved performance and adhere to well-established guidelines. Metrics
must be:

1.22.1.1. (Added) Accurate and useful for decision-making.

1.22.1.2. (Added) Consistent and clearly linked to goals/standards.

1.22.1.3. (Added) Clearly understood and communicated.

1.22.1.4. (Added) Based on a measurable, well-defined process.

1.22.2. (Added) Analysis is crucial to improving organizational performance and is the key
component of the metrics management process. Commanders and maintenance managers must
properly evaluate maintenance metrics and rely upon the maintenance analysis section for
unbiased information. Analysis sections shall draw upon information from various maintenance
information systems for data. The Integrated Maintenance Data System-Central Database
(IMDS-CDB), G081 (CAMS for Mobility), Reliability and Maintainability Information System
(REMIS), Standard Base Supply System (SBSS), AF Knowledge Services (AFKS), Combat
Ammunition System (CAS), and AF/A4-approved command-unique analysis tools are the
primary data sources. A good maintenance manager does not manage the metrics, but rather
uses metrics to focus resources and personnel to improve maintenance processes. Managers
must also clearly understand and communicate the crucial linkage between goals, standards and
metrics. The AF sets goals and standards for organizations, personnel and weapons systems that
facilitate evaluation, comparisons and improvements. These standards are published separately
by senior leadership and should be clearly understood at all levels of command. Leaders at every
level must also support analysis and review metrics to properly drive improved performance.
Maintenance analysts manage and track this process, but maintenance metrics, and the resulting
improvements they drive, are inherently a leadership responsibility.
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012                                             19



1.22.3. (Added) AFMC Test Wing maintenance metric focus. Due to the unpredictable nature
of the test environment, normal fleet availability and program execution indicators may not
portray the most accurate picture of the health of the test fleet. Although the traditional
maintenance metrics (MC Rate, Break Rate, etc) arm the maintenance leader with information
needed to help effectively manage maintenance resources, the focus of AFMC’s test wing
maintenance differs somewhat from an operational wing. Therefore, AFMC’s focus shifts from
the MC Rate, to areas where AFMC’s maintenance units have the most control – scheduled
maintenance and deviations from the flying and test schedule. The key measurements of how
well the maintenance unit manages scheduled and unscheduled maintenance are listed here:

1.22.3.1. (Added) Test Schedule Effectiveness (TSE) Rate. Similar to the Flying Schedule
Effectiveness for the CAF, TSE is a leading indicator and is a measure of how well the unit
planned and executed the weekly flying and ground test event schedule. TSE is derived by
comparing each day’s deviations to the flying and ground test schedule. Deviations that decrease
the TSE from 100 percent include: scheduled sorties/ground test events not accomplished
because of maintenance, supply, operations, weather, HHQ, air traffic control, sympathy, or
other reasons; scheduled events that actually start more than 30 minutes prior to scheduled start
time; scheduled events that begin more than 30 minutes after their scheduled start time and
events that are added to the schedule. Disruptions to the flying or ground test schedule, or
constant configuration changes to test assets can cause turmoil on the flightline, send a ripple
effect throughout other agencies, and adversely impact scheduled maintenance actions.

1.22.3.1.1. (Added)
TSE (%) = Total Ground and Sortie Events Scheduled – Total Deviations x 100
                    Total Ground and Sortie Events Scheduled

1.22.3.2. (Added) Maintenance Deviation Rate (MX Dev). Although all deviations to the test
schedule are counted in the TSE calculation, the Maintenance Deviation Rate represents
deviations to the flying/ground test schedule that are, for the most part, are within the
maintenance community’s control. All maintenance late take offs, ground aborts, cancellations,
and maintenance additions are counted towards the rate. Although all deviations from the
published schedule can cause turmoil on the flightline, maintenance supervision should focus on
eliminating or minimizing schedule deviations due to maintenance.

1.22.3.2.1. (Added)
Maint Dev Rate (%) =         Total Maintenance Deviations                 x 100
                         Total Ground and Sortie Events Scheduled

1.22.3.3. (Added) Scheduling Effectiveness for Maintenance (SEM). SEM is a primary focus
for AFMC. It measures the overall efficiency and effectiveness of scheduled maintenance, as
well as the unit’s effectiveness in responding to unscheduled maintenance. SEM helps identify
turmoil in meeting the wing’s test requirements. It is a weighted combination of a unit’s Total
Scheduling Effectiveness for Maintenance and Maintenance Scheduling Effectiveness rates, both
explained below. SEM includes total scheduled test events, both flight and ground. The unit
should focus on completing scheduled maintenance events, as scheduled, including

documentation, as well as minimizing maintenance deviations to the test schedule.

1.22.3.3.1. (Added) SEM (%) =         [(TSEM % x 10) x 0.7) + (MSE % x 10) x 0.3)]
                                                          10

1.22.3.4. (Added) Maintenance Scheduling Effectiveness (MSE). This is a leading indicator
that measures success in the unit’s ability to plan and complete inspections and periodic
maintenance, including documentation, on-time per the maintenance plan. Deviations to the plan
are recorded. A low MSE rate may indicate a unit is experiencing turbulence on the flightline or
in the back shops. This indicator is primarily used as feedback to maintenance managers on the
success and adherence to scheduled maintenance plans and actions. To compute the MSE, you
must know the number of maintenance actions scheduled and accomplished as scheduled along
with each action’s weighted value (based on the importance of the event and established by
MAJCOM directives).

1.22.3.4.1. (Added) MSE (%) =         Total Points Earned x 100
                                      Total Points Possible

1.22.3.5. (Added) Total Scheduling Effectiveness for Maintenance (TSEM) – TSEM is another
focus area for AFMC’s flightline maintenance community. TSEM measures the effect of
maintenance deviations on the test schedule. The TSEM rate only considers schedule deviations
caused by the maintenance complex.

1.22.3.5.1. (Added)
TSEM (%) = Total Gnd and Sortie Events Sched – Total MX Devs                 x 100
                    Total Gnd and Sortie Events Sched

1.22.4. (Added) Traditional Maintenance Metrics. Metrics are often grouped into various
categories, including leading or lagging indicators. Leading indicators show a problem first, as
they directly impact maintenance’s capability to provide resources to execute the mission.
Lagging indicators follow and show firmly established trends. Maintenance leaders must review
sortie production and maintenance health of fleet indicators constantly and be knowledgeable
about maintenance indicators that highlight trends before they become limiting factors. This
section lists the primary maintenance metrics alphabetically with a description and the formula
for the metric. Referenced Maintenance Status Codes are found in AFI 21-103, Equipment
Inventory, Status and Utilization Reporting, Attachment 2; Flying Codes are found in TO 00-20-
2, Maintenance Data Documentation, Appendix L.

1.22.4.1. (Added) Aircraft Possession. A key factor in metrics involves aircraft “possession.”
The AF mandates each aircraft will always be owned or “possessed” by a designated
organization. Possession is an indicator of an organization’s or aircraft fleet’s health. Aircraft
that are under the control of their owning base are possessed by that organization. An aircraft
that flies to depot for maintenance/inspection or is repaired by a depot team at the base is
temporarily possessed by depot. In calculating the various aircraft maintenance metrics,
possession is calculated in units of hours normally for specific time periods (e.g., monthly,
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012                                                21


annual).

1.22.4.2. (Added) (Total) Abort Rate (AR). A unit’s abort rate is a leading indicator of both
aircraft reliability and quality of maintenance performed. An abort is a test event that ends
prematurely and must be re-accomplished. The abort rate may be measured separately as ground
or air aborts. Abbreviations are: GA = Ground Aborts; AA = Air Aborts; and NTI = Non-Test
Induced

1.22.4.2.1. (Added)
Total AR (%) =      # Maint GA (NTI) + # AA (NTI)                  x 100
                    Total Sorties Flown + Ground Aborts

1.22.4.3. (Added) Aircraft availability. Percentage of a fleet not in a Depot possessed status or
NMC aircraft (that are unit possessed). NOTE: The metric may be created at the Mission
Design (MD)/MDS level or may be grouped by fleet (e.g., Aggregate, Bombers, Fighters) to
determine “Aircraft Availability”.

1.22.4.3.1. (Added) Availability rate =     MC hours*           x 100
                                   Total Possessed Hours (TPH)**

(Added) 1. * MC Hours consists of Possession Purpose Codes (PPC): CA, CB, CC, CF, EH, EI,
IF, PJ, PL, PR, TF, TJ, ZA, and ZB.

(Added) 2. ** Total Possessed Hours (TAI) consist of the following PPC: BJ, BK, BL, BN, BO,
BQ, BR, BT, BU, BW, BX, CA, CB, CC, CF, EH, EI, DJ, DK, DL, DM, DO, DR, IF, PJ, PL,
PR, TF, TJ, XW, XZ, ZA, and ZB

1.22.4.4. (Added) Break Rate (BR). The break rate is a leading, flying-related metric. It is the
percentage of aircraft that land in “Code-3” or “Alpha-3” for Mobility AF (MAF), status. This
metric primarily indicates aircraft system reliability. It may also reflect the quality of aircraft
maintenance performed. If Fix Rates (refer to paragraph 1.15.4.8.) are used as a measurement of
maintainability, the Break Rate is the complementary measurement of reliability. For true
evaluation of equipment/system reliability, measurements must be taken at the system/subsystem
level. It is also an excellent predictor of parts demand. Several indicators that follow break rate
are Mission Capable (MC), Total Not Mission Capable for Supply (TNMCS), Cannibalization
Rate (CR) and Repeat/Recur (R/R).

1.22.4.4.1. (Added) BR (%) =          Number of Sorties that Land “Code-3”          x 100
                                                Total Sorties Flown

1.22.4.5. (Added) Cannibalization Rate (CR). The CR is a leading indicator that reflects the
number of cannibalization (CANN) actions (removal of a serviceable part from an aircraft or
engine to replace an unserviceable part on another aircraft or engine or to fill an Readiness
Spares Package (RSP)). In most cases, a cannibalization action takes place when assets are not
available to meet mission needs or the AFGLSC cannot deliver the part when needed and
mission requirements demand the aircraft be returned to an MC status. The CR is the number of
22                                             AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                   26 APRIL 2012


cannibalization actions per total sorties flown. This rate includes all aircraft-to-aircraft, engine-
to-aircraft, and aircraft/engine to RSP cannibalization actions.

1.22.4.5.1. (Added) CR (%) = Number of Aircraft and Engine CANNs               x 100
                                                 Sorties Flown

1.22.4.6. (Added) Deferred (or Delayed) Discrepancy (DD) Rate (DDR). The DDR is a leading
indicator that should be closely evaluated in comparison to other metrics. This rate represents
the average deferred discrepancies across the unit's average possessed aircraft fleet.
Discrepancies are considered deferred when: a) they are discovered and the decision is made to
defer them, b) discrepancies are scheduled with a start date greater than 5 calendar days after the
discovery date, or c) discrepancies are awaiting parts with a valid off base requisition. Delayed
discrepancies may be Awaiting Maintenance (AWM) or Awaiting Parts (AWP). Although
minor maintenance actions must sometimes be deferred or delayed to a more opportune time,
maintenance should try to keep this rate as low as possible. If delayed discrepancies can’t be
scheduled/combined with a more extensive maintenance action, maintenance schedulers should
routinely schedule their aircraft down for a day when required to work deferred discrepancies.
The DDR metric measures AWM + AWP rates, though individual AWM and AWP rates can and
should also be monitored.

1.22.4.6.1. (Added) Total DDR (%) = Total (Snapshot) AWM + AWP Discrepancies
                                          Average Aircraft Possessed

1.22.4.6.2. (Added) AWM DDR (%) = Total (Snapshot) AWM Discrepancies
                                      Average Aircraft Possessed

1.22.4.6.3. (Added) AWP DDR (%) = Total (Snapshot) AWP Discrepancies
                                       Average Aircraft Possessed

1.22.4.7. (Added) Departure (Logistics) Reliability (DR) Rate (DRR). This is a leading metric
used primarily by the MAF to show a composite of supply, airfield saturation or maintenance
problems. The on-time standard for departures are those within 15 minutes of the daily
scheduled departure time. The metric provides the commander with an objective measure of the
health of the air mobility system and reflects the percentage of departures that are on-time. The
main focus of the departure reliability metric is to strengthen the air mobility system through
accountability for process improvement. This metric may also be subdivided into other
categories (e.g., worldwide departure or en route).

1.22.4.7.1. (Added)
DRR (%) = Number of Departures – Number of Logistics Delays x 100
                         Number of Departures

1.22.4.8. (Added) Fix Rate (FR). The FR is a leading indicator showing how well the repair
process is being managed. It is a percentage of aircraft with a landing status code of 3 (includes
system cap codes 3 and 4) returned to a flyable status in a certain amount of time (clock hours).
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012                                                23


Problems found by maintenance after the aircraft lands (ground found) are not considered in the
fix time. The fix time stops when all Landing Status Code 3 Pilot Reported Discrepancies
(PRDs) are fixed even if the aircraft remains NMC. This metric is an excellent tool to track
"dead time" in aircraft repair processes because it measures the speed of repair and equipment
maintainability. The common, standard interval for this metric is 12-hours. However, fighter
units typically measure fix rate at shorter intervals (4 and/or 8 hours) along with the 12-hour rate.

1.22.4.8.1. (Added)
FR (%) = “Code-3” Breaks Fixed Within 12 Hours of Landing            x 100
                      Total “Code-3” Breaks

1.22.4.9. (Added) Hangar Queen (HQ) (Average) Rate. Refer to Chapter 14 of this instruction
for HQ categories/criteria. This indicator is used to evaluate management of the Hangar Queen
program and to assist units with problems beyond their control. The HQ rate captures the
average number of aircraft HQ days (all categories) for a specified reporting period.

1.22.4.9.1. (Added)
HQ (%) = Total Acft Days in all HQ Categories (in report period) x 100
                     Days (in report period)

1.22.4.10. (Added) Home-Station Logistics Departure Reliability (HSLDR) Rate. This is a
leading metric used primarily by the MAF for airlift aircraft. This delineates down to only first-
leg departures of unit-owned aircraft departing home station.

1.22.4.10.1. (Added)
HSLDR Rate (%) = # of HS Departures – # of HS Logistics Delays x 100
                           # of HS Departures

1.22.4.11. (Added) Isochronal Inspection (ISO) Rate. This leading metric measures the average
time until next major inspection remaining on the fleet. It should be approximately half the
inspection interval and should appear as a diagonal line when the fleet ISO average is portrayed
graphically in a Time-Distribution Interval (TDI) (e.g., “scatter gram”). An ISO TDI is a
product that shows hours remaining until the next phase inspection (PH) on each aircraft
possessed by a unit. However, a unit may have good reasons to manage its ISO flow so the data
points define a pattern other than a diagonal line.

1.22.4.11.1. (Added) ISO Rate = Total Hours of All Possessed Aircraft Until Next ISO
                                       Total Possessed Aircraft Assigned

1.22.4.12. (Added) Mission Capable (MC) Rate. Though this is a lagging indicator, the MC
rate is perhaps the best-known yardstick for measuring a unit’s performance. It is the percentage
of possessed hours (excluding aircraft in “B-Type” possession purpose code/purpose identifier
code status: BJ, BK, BL, BN, BO, BQ, BR, BT, BU, BW, BX) for aircraft that are FMC or PMC
for specific measurement periods (e.g., monthly or annual). A low MC rate may indicate a unit
is experiencing many hard breaks, parts supportability shortfalls or workforce management
issues. Maintenance managers should look for workers deferring repairs to other shifts,
24                                           AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012


inexperienced workers, lack of parts, poor in-shop scheduling, high cannibalization rates or
training deficiencies. High commitment rates may also contribute to a lower MC rate. The key
is to focus on negative trends and identify systemic, underlying causes. Further, the root factors
of the MC rate should be measured, evaluated and reported through the use of the TNMCM,
TNMCS and NMCB rates.

1.22.4.12.1. (Added) MC (%) = FMC Hours + PMC Hours                 x 100
                                 Possessed Hours

1.22.4.12.2. (Added) Total Not Mission Capable Maintenance (TNMCM) Rate. Though a
lagging indicator, the TNMCM rate is perhaps the most common and useful metric for
determining if maintenance is being performed quickly and accurately. It is the average
percentage of possessed aircraft (calculated monthly/annually) that are unable to meet primary
assigned missions for maintenance reasons (excluding aircraft in “B-Type” possession identifier
code status). Any aircraft that is unable to meet any of its wartime missions is considered Not
Mission Capable (NMC). The TNMCM is the amount of time aircraft are in NMCM plus Not
Mission Capable Both (NMCB) status. Maintenance managers should look for a relationship
between other metrics such as R/R, BR and FR to the TNMCM Rate. A strong correlation could
indicate heavy workloads (e.g., people are over tasked), poor management, training problems or
poor maintenance practices. The TNMCM is also called “out for maintenance.”

1.22.4.12.2.1. (Added) TNMCM (%) = NMCM Hrs + NMCB Hrs                      x 100
                                     Possessed Hours

1.22.4.12.3. (Added) Total Not Mission Capable Supply (TNMCS) Rate. Though this lagging
metric may seem a “AFGLSC responsibility” because it is principally driven by availability of
spare parts, it is often directly indicative of maintenance practices. For instance, maintenance
can keep the rate lower by consolidating feasible cannibalization actions to as few aircraft as
practical. This monthly/annual metric is the average percentage of possessed aircraft that are
unable to meet primary missions for supply reasons. The TNMCS rate is the time aircraft are in
NMCS plus NMCB status. TNMCS is based on the number of airframes out for mission capable
(MICAP) parts that prevent the airframes from performing their mission (NMCS is not the
number of parts that are MICAP). Maintenance managers must closely monitor the relationship
between the Cannibalization Rate (CR) and TNMCS.

1.22.4.12.3.1. (Added) TNMCS (%) = NMCS Hrs + NMCB Hrs x 100
                                      Possessed Hours

1.22.4.13. (Added) Primary Aerospace Vehicle Authorized (PAA) vs. Possessed or Primary
Possessed Rate. PAA are those aircraft authorized for a unit to perform their operational
mission(s). It forms the basis to allocate operating resources to include manpower, support
equipment, and flying hour funds. This metric shows a comparison of the unit’s PAA versus
average possessed aircraft for a particular time period. It identifies units below PAA so AFMC
can assist in reallocating resources to support contingency taskings or to reduce flying hour
requirements. Reference AFI 16-402, Aerospace Vehicle Programming, Assignment,
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012                                                25


Distribution, Accounting, and Termination.

1.22.4.13.1. (Added) P/P (%) = Average Number of Possessed Aircraft           x 100
                                         Total Unit Aircraft PAA

1.22.4.14. (Added) Personnel Availability (PA). Personnel availability simply provides a
measure of manning status. It compares the number of personnel authorized to the number of
personnel available. A maintenance manager may find it useful to review data based on skill
level. In which case, compare the personnel authorized to the number of personnel holding a
specific skill level. The number authorized is based on the Unit Manning Document. The
number available includes only those available for duty, which excludes those who are
reassigned, on leave, Temporary Duty (TDY), etc.


1.22.4.14.1. (Added) PA (%) = Total Number of Personnel Available             x 100
                             Total Number of Personnel Authorized

1.22.4.15. (Added) Phase Flow (PF) Average. This leading metric measures the average phase
time remaining on the fleet. It should be approximately half the inspection interval and should
appear as a diagonal line when the fleet PF average is portrayed graphically in a TDI. A phase
TDI is a product that shows hours remaining until the next phase on each aircraft possessed by a
unit. However, a unit may have good reasons to manage its phase flow so the data points define
a pattern other than a diagonal line. For example, in preparation for a long-distance overseas
deployment, a unit may need to build up the average phase time (average fleet time) remaining
on its fleet, because phase capability may be limited for a short time. Beware of gaps or
groupings, especially on aircraft with less than half the time remaining to phase.

1.22.4.15.1. (Added) PF = Total Hours of All Possessed Aircraft Until Next Phase
                                 Total Possessed Aircraft Assigned

1.22.4.16. (Added) Repair Cycle Processing (RCP) Total Time/Rate. Though primarily
considered a “supply-related metric,” this indicator can be an excellent local management tool.
It is the average time expressed in days that an unserviceable asset spends in the repair cycle at a
unit. This indicator is for repairable aircraft parts only; it does not include engines or support
equipment. The clock begins when the replacement part is issued to the flightline and ends when
the serviceable asset is returned from the repair facility to the parts store for reissue. To improve
the process of repairing parts, the different steps in that process must be measured.

1.22.4.16.1. (Added)
RCP (%) = (Pre-Mx + Repair + Post-Mx Days) – AWP Days                 x 100
                     Number of Items Turned In

1.22.4.17. (Added) Repeat/Recurring (R/R) Discrepancy Rate. This metric is a leading
indicator and perhaps the most important and accurate measure of the unit's maintenance quality.
It is the average number of repeat and recur system malfunctions compared to the total number
of aircrew reported discrepancies. A repeat discrepancy is when the same malfunction occurs in
26                                           AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012


a system/subsystem on the next sortie/sortie attempt after the discrepancy originally occurred and
was cleared by maintenance (including CNDs/no-defect-noted, etc). A recurring discrepancy is
when the same system/subsystem malfunction occurs on the 2nd thru 4th flights/attempted
flights after the original flight in which the malfunction occurred and was cleared by
maintenance (including CNDs/ no-defect-noted, etc). A high R/R rate may indicate lack of
thorough troubleshooting; inordinate pressure to commit aircraft to the flying schedule for
subsequent sorties; or a lack of experienced, qualified or trained technicians. The more complex
the weapon system and the greater the operations tempo, the more susceptible a unit is for repeat
or recurring discrepancies. Examine each R/R discrepancy and seek root causes and fixes. The
goal should be to keep all repeat and recurring discrepancies to a minimum.

1.22.4.17.1. (Added) R/R (%) =       Total Repeats + Total Recurs          x 100
                                    Total Pilot Reported Discrepancies

1.22.4.18. (Added) Upgrade Training (UT) Rate. This metric reflects the percentage of
technicians in upgrade training. The goal should be to keep the combined total less than 40
percent because the higher the number, the greater the training burden. Training should be given
high priority, as the number of personnel in training (and more importantly, the quality of the
maintenance training program) invariably affects other aircraft metrics (e.g., R/R or FR) in ways
that may not be immediately obvious.

1.22.4.18.1. (Added) UT (%) = Number of Technicians in Upgrade Training            x 100
                                   Total Number of Technicians

1.22.4.19. (Added) Utilization (UTE) Rate. The UTE rate is a leading indicator, but serves as a
yardstick for how well the maintenance organization supports the unit’s mission. The UTE rate
is the average number of sorties or hours flown per Primary Aerospace vehicle Authorized
(PAA) per month as found in the HAF/A3O PB documents. This measurement is primarily used
by operations in planning the unit's flying hour program. Maintenance uses this measurement to
show usage of assigned aircraft. Since UTE rates are used for planning, actual UTE rates
(computed at the end of the month) are used to evaluate the unit's monthly accomplishment
against the annual plan. Typically, Combat AF (CAF) units measure the sortie UTE rate, while
MAF units measure the hourly UTE rate to more accurately measure the combined performance
of operations and maintenance.

1.22.4.19.1. (Added) UTE Rate =      Sorties (or hours) Flown per Month
                                               PAA per Month

1.23. (Added) Support Agreements (SA). Maintenance organizations may be tasked to
support functions not related to the primary unit mission. Intra-service, inter-service, inter-
command, and international support agreements outline the degree of support provided and the
responsibilities of the supported function. The agreements must be developed and reviewed in
terms of possible impact on the primary unit mission and all other existing agreements and fully
coordinated with the LRS plans function.
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012                                            27


1.23.1. (Added) The support agreement will also identify the manpower required to support the
workload as agreed upon by both organizations.

Chapter 2 - SAFETY

2.7.1. (Added) Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) officials, as
representatives of the Secretary of Labor, may conduct inspections of non military-unique

employee, or official in charge of an operation or workplace.

2.7.2. (Added) Federal OSHA officials may perform OSH inspections of AF workplaces in
areas where the US holds exclusive federal jurisdiction (including government owned contractor
operated facilities).

2.7.3. (Added) State OSHA officials, operating under a federally approved plan and subject to
the terms of any variance, tolerance, or exemption granted by the Department of Labor, may
enforce state OSHA standards in contractor workplaces. At overseas location, local government
agencies may conduct inspections of AF operations where host nation personnel are employed or
contractor facilities or operations as stipulated in the status of forces or country-to-country
agreement IAW AFI 91-202.

Mission Crew Element (MCE) and Launch and Recovery Element (LRE) status will be reported
separately from aircraft status (i.e., Aircraft Code 1, MCE Code 1, LRE Code 1). Aircraft, MCE
and LRE will retain separate 781 forms binders. Mission capable status will also be tracked
separately. Discrepancies will not be entered into 781 forms or IMDS for any asset directly
involved with the mission while the aircraft is airborne. Units will develop a manual debrief data
sheet which is maintained and controlled by the debrief section by mission number. This debrief
data sheet will be used to annotate in-flight maintenance and pilot reported discrepancies.
Continuation sheets will be annotated as #2, #3, etc of XX pages. Once the mission ends and the
post-mission debrief is completed, the 781 forms, IMDS and mission capable status will be
annotated.

4.15.1. (Added) GH RPV Ground Station In-flight Maintenance procedures: UAS Ground
Station In-flight Maintenance is intended to provide repair of maintenance discrepancies while
allowing the mission to continue. Discrepancies discovered during flight will not be documented
into the AF Form 781As or entered into IMDS until after the mission is ended. Upon notification
from the pilot, maintenance technicians will be dispatched to the MCE/LRE. Maintainers will
respond with the debrief data sheet, provided by the debrief section. The pilot will document the
discrepancy and provide written release for maintenance on the debrief data sheet. Maintenance
will not be performed until the pilot releases the aircraft for maintenance. The pilot in control of
the system during the mission will always be the final authority as to what, when and for how
long maintenance actions will be performed during flight. The maintainer will return the debrief
data sheet (with maintenance actions annotated) to the debrief section for inclusion into the final
mission debrief. If additional maintenance actions are responded to during the same mission, the
same debrief data sheet will be used. Use continuation sheets as required.

6.2.6.17.1.1.2. (Added) What are the causes for flying schedule deviations (cancellations,
aborts, additions or early/ late takeoffs)?

6.2.6.17.1.1.3. (Added) Are specific aircraft, equipment, systems, or subsystems contributing to
a disproportionate share of deviations/turbulence?

6.2.6.17.1.1.4. (Added) Is specific equipment failing to perform as scheduled? Does this
equipment require more or less maintenance than others?

6.2.6.17.1.1.5. (Added) Are there enough people to meet mission needs? Are certain work
centers documenting significant overtime or show consistently high utilization rates?

6.2.6.17.1.1.6. (Added) Is there a good balance of skills within AFSCs and between the units?

6.2.6.17.1.1.7. (Added) Do higher rates for repeat/recur discrepancies indicate
training/experience shortfalls?

6.2.6.17.1.1.8. (Added) Is there sufficient time to schedule and work maintenance problems?

6.2.6.17.1.1.9. (Added) Are trends significant? Are the trends short term (6 months or less) or
long term? Where will the unit likely be in 6-12 months?

6.2.6.17.1.1.10. (Added) Are there seasonal or cyclical variations? Are current variations
outliers?

6.2.6.17.3.1. (Added) Which systems are creating a high NMC rate? Are these the normally
high systems? If so, are they higher than normal? What are the high driving components, and
what is being done (or could be done) to address the problems? What factors are causing an
increase or decrease in the NMC hours? Are the unit's deployments affecting the rate, if so to
what extent?

6.2.6.17.3.2. (Added) Are specific aircraft or equipment causing trend distortions?

6.2.6.17.3.3. (Added) What systems have high CND, repeat or recur malfunctions?

6.2.6.17.3.6. (Added) Is supply support sufficient and responsive? If not, why not? Are stocks
adequate?

6.2.6.17.3.7. (Added) Is the lack of training, technical data, or tools and equipment affecting
certain systems or AFSCs?

6.2.6.17.3.8. (Added) Has the AFGLSC been contacted?

6.2.6.17.4. (Added) Analytical Process. The analytical process consists of identifying
contributory factors, manipulating raw data into meaningful formats, computing management
indicators, performing statistical measurements, and creating accurate, complete, and easy to
understand presentations. An analytical process uses a number of methods, (e.g., visual
observation that is dependent upon the experience and knowledge of the observer; comparative
analysis that may be performed statistically or visually and involves the comparison of two or
more like operations or items to identify variations or differences, and statistical analysis or
statistical investigation that is the methodical study of data). These methods are used to reveal
facts, relationships, and differences about data and data elements and are a useful adjunct to
comparative and visual analysis. Analysts should use these tools and other methods to perform
analytical studies to gain insight into unit performance and to enhance process improvement.

6.2.6.17.5. (Added) Management Contributions to the Analytical Process. Maintenance
managers have a significant impact on the usefulness of the MMA to the unit. Managers should
constantly review how information is being organized and presented. The lack of focus
regarding use of data, improper arrangement of data for analysis, or unclear presentations of
results can obscure meaningful information. Managers should be familiar with how data is
developed, interpreted, and presented to ensure accurate presentations of results for decision
making. Special studies and analyses specifically targeted for areas of concerns to managers are
valuable tools in helping units isolate factors surrounding problem areas.

6.2.6.17.5.1. (Added) Analytical Studies. MMA will provide results of investigations, analyses,
or studies to work centers. The most effective study is one that goes beyond superficial con-
clusions. It helps solve a problem relative to mission performance. Specific studies are provided
to the requester, and a file copy is retained for future reference. Disseminate the study by
electronic means or include it in a monthly maintenance summary.

6.2.6.17.5.2. (Added) The study should state assumptions up front, and should be summarized
to state how the significance is measured.

6.2.6.17.5.3. (Added) Although not the only format, most studies will begin with background
information. The study should include the data, research, investigation, and statistical findings,
along with their respective sources. Conclusions relevant to the study should be drawn from the
data, research, investigation, and statistical findings. The study should include recommendations
to address the conclusions relevant to the problem (other issues uncovered can be identified, but
should be kept separate).

6.2.6.17.5.4. (Added) Maintenance Analysis Referrals. A referral is a procedure used to
identify, investigate, and propose corrective action for management problems. These are highly
effective tools to make agencies aware of common problems. Referral reports are used to start
the referral procedure and document the corrective actions for implementation and future
reference. Due to the amount of investigation and research needed to properly process referrals,
ensure they are not used for problems that can be resolved more efficiently through verbal or less
formal communications. Referrals are not determined by a quota system. They are used only
when necessary to affect a permanent solution to a problem that cannot be solved by other
means. Referral reports must be concise, accurate, and timely to provide maintenance managers
with information for making decisions. Anyone can initiate a referral, but MMA is the OPR and
assigns a referral number and maintains a log of all referrals. The log should reflect the referral
number, initiating agency, date, subject, and action taken. QA will work with unit managers and
work center technicians to perform investigations and recommend corrective actions. Route
through the affected agencies for comments, with the final addressee as the MMA section.
Retain copies and indicate whether additional monitoring or follow-up action is necessary.
Provide a completed study to each MXG QA.

6.2.6.17.6. (Added) Dedicated AMU Analysis (where applicable). The AMU analysis function
is intended to provide dedicated analytical support for the AMU. The Maintenance Management
Analysis (MMA) section NCOIC may dedicate an analyst to each AMU. The dedicated AMU
analyst works for the MMA section NCOIC. Accomplishing AMU tasks are the dedicated
analyst’s primary responsibility. The MMA section NCOIC is responsible for the overall
effectiveness of the AMU analysis program. To improve the overall effectiveness of the
dedicated analyst program, analysts should be rotated approximately every 12 months. As a
minimum, the AMU analyst will:

6.2.6.17.6.1. (Added) Review maintenance debriefing data to track in-flight discrepancies and
deviations on each aircraft. Review aircraft status inputs from the MOC for WUC accuracy.
Closely monitor fix time on Code 3 breaks and report results to AMU supervision daily. Brief
problem aircraft and systems to AMU supervision daily.

6.2.6.17.6.2. (Added) Brief comparative AMU data weekly and monthly as required by the
MXG/CC.

6.2.6.17.6.3. (Added) Provide analyses as requested by AMU supervision or when identified
through review of AMU performance data.

6.2.6.17.6.4. (Added) Validate CANN documentation in IMDS-CDB at least weekly, with
AMU supply and inform AMU supervision of its accuracy. If errors exist, a more frequent vali-
dation may be required. Advise AMU supervision of recurring problems.

6.2.6.17.6.5. (Added) Monitor the UTE rate for the AMU.

6.2.6.17.6.6. (Added) Analyze programmed and actual attrition factors.

6.2.6.17.6.7. (Added) Attend AMU scheduling/production meetings at least once per week.

6.2.6.17.6.8. (Added) Maintenance Analysis. Present data by using summaries, charts, graphs,
tabular displays, and narratives. These data presentations should show the relationships among
various factors. Data presentations should be displayed or presented in time to be useful in plans
or reports. A printed monthly maintenance summary, tailored to the needs of the unit, is an
excellent method of presenting data.

6.4.4. Initiate/coordinate with HQ AFMC/A4M on all authorization change requests (ACR).

6.4.4.1. (Added) Coordinate and monitor permanent change of assignment (PCA) actions and
suspense’s of involved agencies for appropriate documentation.

6.4.11. (Added) If applicable, manage the group’s logistics test and evaluation (LT&E) mission
IAW AFI 99-103. The MXG/CC/CL or equivalent will determine if the LT&E flight/element
should be aligned under the MOS, Programs and Resources Flight, AMXS, or stand alone
squadron. If assigned, LT&E flight/element will:

6.4.11.1. (Added) Establish LT&E policy and oversee the LT&E process.

6.4.11.2. (Added) Manage development and usage of LT&E training courses.

Chapter 7 - MAINTENANCE PLANS, SCHEDULING AND DOCUMENTATION
(PS&D)

7.2.1.2. The AMU PS&D will conduct document reviews and validations at least every 14 days
on CANN aircraft. The documents are also reviewed before and upon completion of other major
programs such as Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM), analytical condition inspections, and
special tests. The AFTO Forms 781F, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Report and Maintenance
Document, will also be reviewed for accuracy.

7.2.1.2.1. (Added) Modular engine flying hours and manual cycles are verified with the EM
section during document reviews.

7.2.1.2.2. (Added) If the aircraft has been away from home station and it has been more than 30
days since the last document review, check the documents within 7 days after return.

7.2.1.3. The AMXS will develop local procedures to review aircraft forms and MIS automated
products as part of document reviews and/or validations. This process will include a review by
the aircraft section/flight commander or NCOIC, then the AMU PS&D. This process will allow
each level of supervision to review and maintain continuity of the process.

7.2.4.6. (Added) If ACM responsibilities are delegated to other work centers, MOF PS&D will
develop a formal agreement between AFMC and the delegated work center to assign
responsibilities and guidelines for updating/correcting the CAMS/IMDS database (e.g., check
suspense validation records in IMDS and coordinate to ensure the appropriate work center
processes their suspense‘s daily).

7.2.4.6.1. (Added) When assigning these responsibilities, consideration must be given to the
agency performing removal and replacement actions for the configured item, (i.e., the egress
shop has the responsibility for CAD/PAD items, while flightline avionics has the responsibility
for tracked LRUs, etc.).

7.2.4.6.2. (Added) Additionally, this guidance establishes procedures to ensure configuration
data is maintained during routine maintenance actions

7.2.4.7. (Added) All TO 00-25-107, Maintenance Assistance, requests must be certified at the
appropriate center level and coordinated through HQ AFMC/A4MM.

7.2.6. Command-directed temporary (T-1 and T-2) modifications are similar to TCTOs;
however, they are temporary, and there is no corresponding change to approved weapon system
42                                          AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012


technical data. The approved modification instruction is the authority for both modification and
maintenance as long as the modification is installed. To maintain configuration control,
command-directed modifications are documented in the same manner as TCTOs. QA must
maintain a copy of the command T-1 and T-2 modification instructions on file until they are
formally rescinded. Follow additional AFMC guidance in AFMCI 21-126, Temporary 2 (T2)
Modification of Aerospace Vehicles.

7.2.6.1. MOF PS&D or equivalent has the overall responsibility on depot level TCTO
management. MOF PS&D will coordinate with System Program Managers, Lead Commands,
and AFMC/A4MM.

7.2.6.1.7.1. (Added) Until proper disposition is determined, MOF PS&D will record and
maintain TCTO kits received for aircraft in waivered status for applicable TCTOs. Consult with
TCTO single managers and test program managers for proper disposition of kitted TCTOs. If
unable to attain disposition of received kitted TCTOs, contact AFMC/A4MM for guidance.

7.2.6.1.8. (Added) MOF PS&D will manage the status reporting for command-directed
assessments, modifications, and modification rescissions that require de-compliance work, as
well as organizational, intermediate, and depot TCTOs. Command-directed modifications will
be identified by a title, command data code, and rescission date.

7.2.6.2.2.16. (Added) The owning scheduling agencies will ensure all automated reports are
verified and corrected IAW TO 00-20-2, Maintenance Data Documentation.

7.2.6.2.2.17. (Added) Each month, MOF PS&D, EM section, and TCTO managing agencies
receive a copy of the TCTO reconciliation listing and must annotate this listing with TCTO
requirements.

7.2.6.2.2.18. (Added) MOF PS&D monitors completion of commodity TCTOs and coordinates
with performing work centers to ensure compliance within specified time limits. AMU PS&D
establishes schedules for completion of installed commodity TCTOs with companion aircraft
TCTOs. AMU PS&D schedules aircraft TCTOs or on-equipment munitions type TCTOs. The
EM section schedules non-installed engine-related TCTOs and coordinates with AMU PS&D on
installed engine related TCTOs. The munitions flight scheduler manages TCTOs for all air-
launched surface attack guided missiles and associated support equipment, munitions, nuclear
ordnance commodity management (NOCM) items, guidance kits, air intercept/aerial guided
missiles and air intercept/aerial rockets.

7.2.6.2.4. (Added) TCTO Waiver Procedures. Commanders of AFMC organizations may
temporarily waive compliance with routine, immediate and urgent action TCTOs (Organiza-
tional, Intermediate and Depot Level) only when TCTOs are applicable to components of a
system or subsystem that are deactivated or removed from the aircraft because of RDT&E
missions or compliance of the TCTO would adversely affect the test mission. Procedures are
outlined in AFI 63-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management.
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012                                             43


7.2.6.2.4.1. (Added) Owning organization will initiate the waiver request for Organizational,
Intermediate, and Depot Level TCTOs.

7.2.6.2.4.2. (Added) The request will include the affected TCTO number, T-2 modification
number and specifically why the modification interferes with accomplishing the TCTO.

7.2.6.2.4.3. (Added) The owning organization will contact the TCTO single manager to ensure
that noncompliance will not result in a safety of flight condition, and to see if there are any
safeguards that should be taken until the TCTO can be complied with. Include the single
manager’s name and phone number on the waiver request.

7.2.6.2.4.4. (Added) Owning organization will coordinate the waiver request with the
MXG/CC/CL or equivalent.

7.2.6.2.4.5. (Added) Once the request has been signed, forward a copy of the signed request to
the TCTO monitor, command aircraft manager, and the TCTO single manager. Wing TCTO
monitor will retain a record copy.

7.2.6.2.5. (Added) Noncompliance will be recorded on the AFTO Form 95, Significant
Historical Data, and appropriate Maintenance Information System, as applicable IAW TO 00-
20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Policy and Procedures,
and TO 00-5-15, Air Force Time Compliance Technical Order Process. The entry will indicate
the reason and estimated date of compliance.

7.2.6.2.5.1. (Added) Conduct an annual review and validate all waived TCTOs using the
original MXG/CC/CL or equivalent approved date or last review date.

7.2.6.2.5.2. (Added) Send a list of waived TCTOs to HQ AFMC/A4MM no later than the first
workday of January and July or when a significant change to a TCTO or waiver has occurred.

7.2.7.6.1. Agencies requesting changes or updates to the need date of any cartridge actuated
device/propellant actuated device (CAD/PAD) item must coordinate with AMU PS&D, MOF
PS&D, and munitions accountable systems officer (MASO) in sufficient time to preclude
emergency issue requests. Agencies requesting a change shall provide justification if need dates
are changed by more than 30 days. No justification is necessary if changes are within 30 days,
regardless of the quarter, or if the change is driven by OO-ALC. Issue requests for unforecasted
or improperly forecasted items (except for replacement of inadvertently fired items or items
found to be unserviceable) will be supported by a letter of justification signed by the
MXG/CC/CL or designated representative.

7.2.7.11. Prepare AFTO Form 223, Time Change Requirements Forecast for TO 00-20-9,
Forecasting Replacement Requirements for Selected Calendar and Hourly Time Change Items
and applicable -6 TO requirements. Forward AFTO Form 223 to the MOF PS&D section. MOF
PS&D will review all AMU AFTO Form 223 and will forward a combined list of requirements
to the appropriate supply agency. AMU PS&D is responsible for forecasting only those selected
items specifically identified in TO 00-20-9, and the aircraft -6 TO.
44                                           AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012



7.2.9.1.1. (Added) MOF PS&D personnel will:

7.2.9.1.1.1. (Added) Ensure a minimum of 6 months of engine operating time are remaining on
time change items (TCI) such as modules/compressors/turbines/gearboxes and other major
components at time of transfer or according to established MOA.

7.2.9.1.1.2. (Added) Ensure all engines have a complete borescope inspection accomplished
unless a borescope was accomplished within the last 10 aircraft flying hours.

7.2.9.1.1.3. (Added) Verify TCIs have a minimum of 60 days or 50 hours remaining at time of
transfer.

7.2.9.1.1.4. (Added) Verify all SI have at least 25 percent of the usable time remaining at time
of transfer.

7.2.9.1.1.5. (Added) Include two copies of the IMDS pilot reported discrepancy (PRD) report
(NFS1SO screen 179) for the previous 90-day period in the aircraft records file.

7.2.9.6.1. MOF/AMU PS&D will generate two copies of the following products listed below
and forward one copy of each to the gaining unit not later than (NLT) 30 days before the aircraft
is scheduled to be transferred. Annotate changes in red on the remaining copy and include it
with the aircraft record jacket file at time of transfer.

7.2.9.6.1.1. (Added) Automated records check (ARC).

7.2.9.6.1.2. (Added) Transfer of equipment (TRE) for aircraft and engine(s).

7.2.9.6.1.3. (Added) Significant history data (SHD) for aircraft and engine(s) CFT, W/B/T, and
EFT.

7.2.9.6.1.4. (Added) AFTO Form 427, Aircraft Integral Fuel Tank Repair Historical Record, or
AFTO Form 428, B-1B Aircraft Integral Fuel Tank Repair History Record.

7.2.9.7. (Added) During AGE Transfers. In addition to the inspection requirements in TO 00-
20-1 and TO 35-1-4, Processing And Inspection Of Support Equipment For Storage And
Shipment, QA may perform an assessment on each AGE item. The inspection includes a com-
plete records check. When the capability exists, ensure all discrepancies are corrected prior to
equipment transfer. Annotate in the equipment forms any discrepancy not corrected due to lack
of parts.

7.2.9.8. (Added) Foreign country and/or sister service aircraft that will be flown/maintained by
AFMC units will require a transfer inspection (reference T.O. 00-20-1 and 00-35D-54 Chapter
8).
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012                                                  45


7.2.9.9. (Added) Loaner aircraft from another USAF unit require a signed MOA from both the
losing and the gaining MXG/CC or equivalent containing, at a minimum, the inspection
requirements listed in AFI 21-101 para. 7.2.9.1 – 7.2.9.6.

7.2.9.9.1. (Added) Foreign country and/or sister service loaner aircraft require a signed MOA
from both the losing and the gaining MXG/CC or equivalent containing, at a minimum, the
inspection requirements listed in AFI 21-101 para. 7.2.9.1 – 7.2.9.6 or foreign country/sister
service equivalent requirements.

7.2.9.10. (Added) In conjunction with MMA DBM, MOF PS&D personnel will process the
aircraft transfer file from REMIS IAW AFCSM 21-576V2, Generic Configuration Status
Accounting System (GCSAS), Software User Manual. NOTE: DBMs must process NFS6A0,
screen 47 and 942, upon receipt of approved file from REMIS. This must be accomplished prior
to processing IMDS-CDB program NFS3W0 (actual configuration).

7.2.9.11. (Added) MOF PS&D personnel will request approved configuration tables for B-1, B-
2, F-15 and F-16 units and actual configuration tables for all other MDSs using IMDS screen 334
(IMDS-CDB units only).

7.2.9.12. (Added) Ensure maintenance performs a complete aircraft Dash 21 series TO
equipment inventory IAW AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status and Utilization Reporting.

7.2.9.13. (Added) Complete a 100 percent egress system CAD/PAD inspection on newly
assigned aircraft and upon those returning from depot/PDM where the egress system has been
worked on by depot personnel with the exception of B-1 and B-2 aircraft. For these aircraft, all
visible components will be inspected.

7.2.9.14. An ADR must be completed prior to first flight after inspection. AMU PS&D or
equivalent will make appropriate entries in the MIS aircraft automated history for all aircraft
transfers detailing the date, current operating time, location, unit, and a general synopsis of
worked performed or reason for transfer.

7.2.10. AFMC will not perform aircraft acceptance inspections.

7.2.12. (Added) Status Reporting. Accomplish status reporting IAW AFI 21-103. Aircraft
transfer Possession Purpose Code (PPC) “BT” may only be used within the following guidelines.
These guidelines also apply for permanent aircraft transfers via PDM/modification or contract
repair facility. NOTE: If the gaining organization utilizes the aircraft prior to the transfer
inspection, use of “BT” status will not be authorized.

7.2.12.1. (Added) Intra-command (within AFMC) transferring aircraft may be possessed in this
code no longer than 2 workdays for the losing organization (to prepare the aircraft) and no longer
than 2 workdays for the gaining organization (to accept the aircraft). This code allows the
organization time to prepare and complete pre-transfer inspections and actions in a non-
possessed status. HQ AFMC/A4M must approve any extension.
46                                             AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                   26 APRIL 2012


7.2.12.2. (Added) Inter-command (into or out of AFMC) transferring aircraft may be possessed
in this code no longer than 2 workdays for both accepting and preparing the aircraft. This code
allows the organization time to prepare and complete pre-transfer inspections and actions in a
non-possessed status. Any extension must be approved by HQ AFMC/A4M.

7.2.12.3. (Added) Aircraft going to programmed depot maintenance (PDM)/modification may
be possessed in this code for no longer than 2 workdays to prepare the aircraft. Aircraft
returning from PDM/modification, contract field team or depot field team maintenance units may
use this PPC no longer than 2 workdays after return of the aircraft. PPC “BT” is not authorized
for the sole purpose of accomplishing scheduled maintenance such as TCTO, time change items
and special inspections before or after PDM/modification input. HQ AFMC/A4M must approve
any extension.

7.3.2. (Added) The principal area of concern is the overall flying/ground test schedule. For
mission accomplishment and improved efficiency, the following must be considered: maximize
crew training on all flights, plan alternate missions when possible, ensure configurations and fuel
loads are accurate, and establish launch and recovery patterns, and utilize historical attrition data.

7.4.3. Final assessments of maintenance capabilities to support the operations “first look”
projections are sent to MAJCOM A3/A4.

7.5. Annual Maintenance Planning Cycle. PS&D or equivalent will perform the long-range
planning function and uses MIS products such as time distribution index (TDI), planning
requirements (PRA), and workable TCTO report (WTR) to determine long-range maintenance
requirements. PS&D will forecast and monitor requirements for the planned fiscal year.

7.5.3. (Added) Maintenance requirements are included in long-range plans to project aircraft
availability. Develop long-range maintenance plans in as much detail as possible. All
maintenance requirements will be consolidated into a single long-range plan using AF Form
2401, Equipment Utilization and Maintenance Schedule, or computer generated form. As a
minimum, the long-range plan shows the current month’s and the next 2 months’ known
maintenance requirements. As a minimum, include the next due date for all calendar
inspections, calendar time change items, TCTOs in workable status, PDM schedules, and at least
the next 3 aircraft ISO/PE/Phase inspections. Other maintenance requirements such as engine
changes, hourly requirements, acceptance/transfer inspections, training and cannibalization
aircraft will be posted as they become known or planned. Add Alternate Mission Equipment
(AME) inspections to the long-range plan if the aircraft is scheduled to stay in that configuration
to ensure the inspections are included in the monthly and weekly schedules.

7.5.3.1. (Added) Maintenance planning includes predictable maintenance factors based on
historical data and other staff inputs (e.g., flow times for maintenance, turnaround times, and
parts replacement schedules).

7.5.3.2. (Added) Include all known operational events (e.g., exercises, deployments, and
development tests) during maintenance planning to determine the maintenance capability to meet
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012                                               47


operational needs.

7.6. Quarterly Maintenance and Operations Planning. The quarterly plan applies to Test
Wing training missions and all known test missions.

7.6.1. Include known test and test support schedules into quarterly plan. Because alert
commitments are not performed by AFMC units, include the following priority to determine
which objectives to support if a lack of resources prevents meeting requirements:

7.6.1.4. (Added) Test and test support missions.

7.6.2.1. (Added) The unit’s rolling 3-month maintenance plan briefed each month meets the
intent of the quarterly scheduling process. The meeting may be held in conjunction with the
weekly or as a separate scheduling meeting.

7.7. Monthly Maintenance and Operations Planning. Due to the nature of the test mission, a
monthly schedule for publishing according to AFI 21-101 is not conducive to mission
requirements: instead, a monthly plan will be created for planning purposes.

7.7.5. Known operational needs and maintenance requirements are the basis for developing the
monthly flying and maintenance plans. QA scheduled inspections listed by type and quantities
are included in the monthly flying and maintenance plan unless published separately by QA.

7.7.6. (Added) The monthly maintenance plan may be published separately or as an annex to
the last weekly schedule of the preceding month. If published separately, distribute the plan no
later than (NLT) five calendar days before the beginning of the month.

7.8.3.9.1. (Added) AF Form 2407, Approval Authority. All AF Form 2407 changes that add
aircraft or sorties or increase the flying window require both OG and MXG commander (or
designated group level representative) approval. MXG/CD or equivalent will approve changes
to the final schedule and coordinated through affected AMXS Operations Officer/MX SUPT,
AMU OIC/SUPT, MXS Operations Officer/MX SUPT, operations group representative,
maintenance group, and wing staff agencies. (e.g. MOC, PS&D, Analysis, etc.) using an AF
Form 2407. MOC will coordinate higher headquarters directed taskings that require immediate
execution.

7.8.3.9.2. (Added) AFMC units are authorized to use the Edwards Scheduling System (ESS)
and Center Scheduling Enterprise (CSE) in recording and coordinating changes to the weekly
schedule in place of AF Form 2407. Electronic coordination is acceptable provided receipt is
acknowledged and the sender enters the name of the person notified, along with date/time of
notification, and logged-in accordance with requirements on the AF Form 2407.

7.8.3.9.3. (Added) Interchanges (Tail Number Swaps). Interchanges should be used to prevent
reconfigurations and unnecessary expenditures of work hours when the prime aircraft is not
mission-capable by its scheduled takeoff time. Every effort is made to make the aircraft
interchanges at the daily maintenance scheduling meeting the day prior to the aircraft scheduled
48                                           AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012


flight and entered on the AF Form 2407. All interchanges made at the daily maintenance
scheduling meeting are entered on an AF Form 2407 for audit and analysis purposes.

7.8.3.9.4. (Added) Configuration. Finalize aircraft and equipment configurations at the daily
maintenance scheduling meeting and document it on an AF Form 2407. To prevent excessive
expenditures of work hours, configuration changes made after the daily maintenance scheduling
meeting and prior to the first crew ready time the next day, require an AF Form 2407 coordinated
through the required agencies.

7.8.4. (Added) Units must effectively plan and execute operations, test and maintenance
schedules. Each day, no later than 1600 local time, the OG/CC and MXG/CC/CL or their
designated group representative will review the flying and maintenance schedule, agree on
revisions, and coordinate with other agencies to confirm the next day’s activities. Use AF Form
2407, Weekly/Daily Flying Schedule Coordination, or authorized automated system in
coordinating the final schedule through the affected AMXS Operations Officer/MX SUPT, AMU
OIC/SUPT, MXS Operations Officer/MX SUPT, operations group representative, maintenance
group, and wing staff agencies. (i.e. MOC, PS&D, Analysis, etc.). Develop flying schedules
IAW AFI 21-101.

7.8.4.1. (Added) Each unit will establish local publications for making modifications to the
weekly schedule.

7.8.4.2. (Added) The MXG/CC/CL, OG/CC, and/or director(s) will approve the proposed
weekly flying schedule and forward to the WG/CC for final approval. Once the weekly schedule
is reviewed and signed by the OG/CC, MXG/CC and WG/CC it becomes the final planning
guide for both operations and maintenance and the basis for deviation reporting. The schedule
will be followed as printed or as amended by coordinated changes. MOF PS&D will publish the
final weekly flying schedule.

7.8.4.3. (Added) MOF PS&D will record maintenance scheduling deviations and forward the
computations to MOF maintenance analysis weekly for publication in the monthly maintenance
summary.

7.8.4.4. (Added) Spare aircraft requirements are based on projected test mission needs. The
following factors are used to determine spares and are not hard limits but guidelines, and as such,
it is up to the AMU to actually schedule what it can support:

54                                           AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012


requirements. The Maintenance Quality Manual or COR will identify specific technical and/or
weapons systems training requirements.

8.8.1. (Added) Group QA Chief will analyze Quality Data and take measures to prevent
complacency and to ensure a “fresh look” at maintenance processes and maintenance discipline
in all areas and shifts of operations.

8.9. Activity Inspection Program. AFMC units with assigned Quality Assurance will establish
an activity inspection program. The MXW/MXG/CC/CL must ensure the depth and detail of the
activity inspection is sufficient to evaluate the management capability of the maintenance
organization. This can be achieved by expanding the minimum requirements outlined herein or
by adding special subject items. When conducting Activity Inspections, the team should use (but
are not limited to) the appropriate AF and MAJCOM LCAP and IG inspection checklists and
process improvement tools as the basis to evaluate and provide actionable feedback for unit
leadership. The team should evaluate the maintenance and logistics processes to ensure the right
tools, equipment, technical orders, parts, requirements, etc. are on hand and properly integrated
into the overall maintenance and logistic processes. Additionally, the activity inspection team
should address internal problems of the unit and those caused by other activities outside the
jurisdiction of the inspected unit. The MXW/MXG QA Chief recommends adjustments to the
requirements based on trends and problem areas identified by QA personnel, MAJCOM and AF
IG, LCAP inspections, or audit reports. In addition to utilizing QA inspectors, subject matter
experts, cross utilizing flight or section chiefs etc. can be used to conduct the Activity
Inspections. The reviews are planned, coordinated, and executed by the QA Focal Point.
Activity inspection intervals will not exceed 12 months.

8.9.2. The MXW/MXG/CC/CL will determine the scope of the units inspection.

8.9.2.1. (Added) The activity inspection should encompass a statistical sampling of all
sections/flights of the organization being inspected and unit self inspection programs within each
inspected section/flight. Whenever possible, locally required inspections conducted by outside
agencies (e.g., wing safety, training, security, LRS, BE, or the fire department) should be
accomplished in conjunction with the QA activity inspection. This reduces the number of
disruptions to the organization being inspected and also increases the comprehensiveness of the
activity inspection. However, if outside agencies accomplish a separate inspection within the
activity inspection year, these can also be counted as part of the annual activity inspection.

8.9.3.1. (Added) Activity Inspection Reports. Inspectors should work with the inspected
organization to assist in performing root cause analysis and developing corrective action plans
for Wing wide systemic issues.

8.9.4. (Added) Follow-up Inspections. Depending upon the severity of discrepancies and the
overall rating, the MXW/MXG/CC/CL will direct specific follow-up inspections. Follow-up
inspections must not cause other inspections to be delayed.

8.10. Maintenance Standardization and Evaluation Program (MSEP). As AFMC OPR,
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012                                             55

8.10.9.4.15. (Added) Develop a QA Surveillance Schedule/Plan (QASP) by unit and evaluators.

8.10.9.4.16. (Added) Procedures to determine Acceptable Quality Levels (AQL).

8.10.9.4.17. (Added) Acceptable Quality Levels (AQL)/Standards. A standard is the acceptable
quality level (number of minor defects) that can be considered satisfactory as a process average
or conforming to established criteria.

8.10.9.4.17.1. (Added) An AQL/standard denotes the maximum allowable number of minor
findings for any assessment. It must be strict enough that the task, process, or product meets an
acceptable level of quality, but is not so strict that a CAT I/QAR-1 rating is unattainable. The
AQL/standard is derived from QA performance-based data. MXW/MXG QA will develop
procedures for determining minimum AQL/standard levels delineating an “attainable” quality
level. These levels will comprise the AQL standards for all assessment types.

8.10.9.4.17.2. (Added) Failure to meet an AQL/standard results in the assessment being rated as
a CAT I/CAT II MAJOR/QAR-3 failure. An identified major finding would also result in an
assessment being rated as a QAR-3.

8.10.9.4.18. (Added) The unit MSEP E&I Plan implemented at the MXG level with sections
dedicated for each squadron.

8.10.9.4.19. (Added) The E&I Plan will be developed and reviewed monthly and updated
quarterly.

8.10.10.2.1. (Added) The QA E&I Plan will define “readily detectable” for CAT II
discrepancies.

8.10.11.2. CAT II minors shall be documented for trends, and will be counted against the AQL.

8.10.13.3.1. (Added) UCR. An unsatisfactory condition is defined as an event/discrepancy that
requires immediate supervisory intervention to ensure safety or process/product fit, form or
function reliability. Unsatisfactory conditions are deemed major and will be documented as a
UCR. A condition of a minor nature shall be documented against the applicable checklist or its
regulatory guidance.

8.10.14. Personnel Evaluations (PE). A PE is a direct evaluation on task qualified personnel
(Note: Personnel evaluations for industrial services and non-critical support personnel is
optional at local discretion). QA will provide inspection notification IAW the applicable labor
agreement. QA will determine what task will be evaluated. The PE will be on work in-progress
or work about to begin. Use PEs to evaluate job proficiency, degree of training, and compliance
with technical data. PEs will be used to evaluate newly certified personnel/teams, process
changes to include the new processes and procedures and equipment changes. Individuals
performing or certifying PAC maintenance tasks are subject to a PE. Rate PEs “pass” or “fail”
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012                                                 61


based on established AQLs/standards. Document the PE on AF Form 2419, Routing and Review
of Quality Control Report, MIS, or in the MAJCOM-approved database. Ensure personnel
performing maintenance on aircraft/equipment pass a PE every 24 months. Failed evaluations
will result in a re-evaluation within 30 days of recertification of failed task. Supervisors will
notify QA when recertification is accomplished.

8.10.14.1. The PE will include an evaluation of the individual’s training records, tool box,
TMDE and TO. General maintenance practices that relate directly to the task being performed
(e.g., safety, material handling, use of tools and equipment, Foreign Object Damage prevention,
Electrostatic Discharge prevention, and workmanship) will be examined during the PE. Other
maintenance practices may also be examined as locally determined.

8.10.14.1.2.1. (Added) The team task is rated as an overall pass or fail. Team evaluations will
be scored the same as PEs. During team evaluations, errors committed by team member(s) and
not detected by team chief may also be attributed to the team chief.

8.10.14.2. Individuals or team members will be decertified (on the evaluated task) by their
supervisor for a failed PE rating in accordance with applicable training regulations.

8.10.20. The MXW/GP/unit must conduct quarterly meetings to review the visual information,
graphs, narratives, quality trends identified through inspections and evaluations, discussion of
common problem areas and descriptions of successful programs or initiatives in the monthly
summary per paragraph 8.10.19 above. Meeting minutes to include slide presentation with
corrective actions plans and will be posted on the QA Community of Practice (CoP).

8.11. Lead Command-approved QA database. If unit developed databases that include the
minimum data field requirements listed in paragraph 8.11.1. thru 8.11.14., then the unit will
forward a copy to HQ AFMC/A4US for review and approval.

8.12.2.1. Deficiency reporting also includes quality, material, software, warranty and service
reports (SR), exhibit processing, and inputs for R&M working groups.

8.12.2.4. At the heart of the R&M effort are many improvement programs such as PIP, IDEA,
productivity, reliability, availability, maintainability (PRAM) program, and PIWGs. The PIM is
an integral part of the information gathering and education process of PIWGs. This is
accomplished by emphasizing and promoting the PIP through to maintenance technicians and
supervisors during visits to work centers. To enhance R&M, the PIM will:

8.12.2.4.8. (Added) Report unit factors contributing to a deficiency to the appropriate local
agency or supervisor for resolution.

8.12.2.4.9. (Added) Identify potential PIWG items by the letter P on the DR logs.

8.12.2.4.10. (Added) Attend PIWGs, or provide adequate background on PIWG issues to
AFMC functional managers to allow for quality representation.

8.12.2.4.11. (Added) Evaluate the overall unit configuration management program by reviewing
technical, managerial, and documentation aspects of the program and reporting any deficiencies
to appropriate local manager or as directed in TO 00-5-15, Air Force Time Compliance
Technical Order Process, and AFMC instructions. Immediate action, urgent action, and safety
TCTOs require particular attention and emphasis.

8.12.2.4.12. (Added) Monitor and document initial compliance on TCTOs and determine depth
and frequency of inspection coverage. Coverage is directly related to the complexity of the
TCTO as well as to how critical the system or the component is to be modified.

8.12.2.4.13. (Added) Support verification, validation and TCTO kit proofing, OTIs and
command-directed modifications.

8.12.2.4.14. (Added) Along with the TCTO monitor, attend all TCTO planning and recon-
ciliation meetings.

8.12.2.4.15. (Added) Ensure all test aircraft that do not meet TCTO applicability criteria due to
installed modifications are identified and tracked in a comprehensive database system. This non-
applicability list will reference the waiver of compliance signed by the MXG/CC.

8.12.2.4.16. (Added) Coordinate with the MOF PS&D and the combined flight test (CFT)
modification manager (when necessary), the PIM will ensure all aircraft that are de-modified
have a conformity check (de-mod reconciliation) complied with to ensure aircraft TCTOs are
reinstated (As applicable).

8.13. Configuration Management (CM) and Modification Management. Configuration
management includes formulating and submitting modification proposals, and tracking unit
concerns being worked by depots and/or contractors. A modification proposal is a
recommendation to change the operation, use, or appearance of Air Force equipment (Also
known as form, fit, and function). A requirement IAW AFI 10-601, Operation Capability
Requirements Development, is necessary to start the process to modify Air Force Equipment, and
modifications a completed AF Form 1067, Modification Proposal, can act as a requirement. If a
requirement does not already exist, submit proposed modifications on an AF Form 1067. After
approval by the appropriate Configuration Review Board (CRB), mail or fax the proposal to the
HQ AFMC/A4M functional area manager for information purposes and to the equipment Single
Manager (SM) for Configuration Control Board (CCB) approval and review. In no case modify
any Air Force equipment without a TCTO or CCB directive. Specific modification configuration
control authority unique to AFMC test centers will be defined in the base supplement to AFI 21-
101 for AGE and other Support equipment, and in Test Wing Operating Instructions that execute
the requirements of AFMC Instruction 21-126, Temporary 2 (T2) Modification of Aerospace
Vehicles, for Temporary (T-2) modifications of aerospace vehicles.

8.13.2.1. (Added) Command-directed temporary (T-1 and T-2) modifications are similar to
TCTOs; however, they are temporary, and there is no corresponding change to approved weapon
system technical data. The approved modification instruction is the authority for both
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012                                                63


modification and maintenance as long as the modification is installed. To maintain configuration
control, command-directed modifications are documented in the same manner as TCTOs. QA
must maintain a copy of the command T-1 and T-2 modification instructions on file until they
are formally rescinded. Follow additional AFMC guidance in AFMCI 21-126, Temporary 2 (T2)
Modification of Aerospace Vehicles.

8.14.1.3.1. (Added) Send two copies to base supply materiel storage and distribution flight
inspection section with a cover letter requesting the number of TCTO affected items in supply.
Base supply endorses the cover letter, returns it to the PIM and provides a copy to MOF. The
PIM will provide copies of each TCTO received to the MOF/PS&D function. Send a copy of
MSE TCTOs to munitions flight. The PIM develops the suspense for each cover letter.

8.14.1.3.2. (Added) Send a copy of TCTOs for munitions or missiles to the munitions flight and
munitions operations upon receipt. If parts are required from base supply or components stocked
by base supply are affected, send one copy to base supply and one copy to materiel control,
maintenance supply liaison (MSL), or aircraft support flight section. Do not furnish the 11N
series TCTOs to base supply, materiel control, or MSL.

8.14.1.5.1. (Added) Monitor the TODA and its sub functions including the central TO file,
LCL, LWC, and local job guide (LJG) program, computer program identification numbering
(CPIN), pack-up data IAW TO 00-5-1, Air Force TO System, and timely notification of priority
technical data to the appropriate group or squadron supervisors.

8.16.2.7. (Added) Ensure standard FCF profile and associated procedures are established for
each type of assigned aircraft. In addition, when a full FCF profile is not required, a tailored
profile is developed by eliminating procedures from the standard profile not required to verify
functional ability of the system causing the FCF.

8.16.2.8. (Added) The aircraft -6 TO does not normally require an FCF for a single engine
change on a two engine aircraft. However, FCFs are required for an extended over-the-water
flight (i.e., overseas deployment). This requirement applies to engines received from the
propulsion flight or depot with no aircraft operating time since major maintenance. This does
not apply to engines obtained from donor aircraft (i.e., CANN) with established aircraft oper-
ating time.

8.16.3.6. (Added) The following are FCF program manager responsibilities:

8.16.3.6.1. (Added) Ensure coordination with the appropriate squadron for an FCF pilot/aircrew
and provide squadron operations with the following information: aircraft tail number, reason for
the FCF, and anticipated takeoff time.

8.16.3.6.1.1. (Added) Local FCF procedures will include:

8.16.3.6.1.1.1. (Added) Debriefing procedures.

8.16.3.6.2.5. (Added) Review the log monthly for trends indicating problems requiring further
analysis or corrective actions. Identify deficient areas and forward to the MXW/CC/CL/CD and
OG/CC for required review or action.

8.16.3.6.3. (Added) FCF checklist must be used for each FCF. QA must debrief all FCFs with
the appropriate debrief function. During debriefing, the FCF checklist and aircraft forms must be
reviewed to determine if all requirements have been accomplished. Each discrepancy discovered
during the FCF must be documented on AFTO Form 781A. After completing the review, the
checklist must be sent to PS&D for inclusion in the aircraft jacket file.

8.16.3.6.4. (Added) Maintain a copy of the AF Form 2400 or automated product for deficiency
and trend analysis.

8.16.7.1. (Added) While performing an FCF away from home station, the applicable
requirements for FCFs of the transient/host base must be followed. The transient/host base QA
office must be contacted and should be the focal point for all FCF requirements.

8.19.1.1. The weight and balance authority is the MXG/CC or equivalent.

8.19.1.8. Weight and balance handbook storage and physical location will be determined by
MXG/CC or equivalent and must be standardized for like MDS.

8.20.1.1. (Added) Notify MAJCOM functional managers when local chafing OTIs are
implemented.

the responsibility of the applicable AMU and/or MXS Flights. Uncorrected discrepancies not
creating NMC or PMC status are deferred discrepancies and loaded into MIS as soon as possible.
Discrepancies are considered deferred as soon as they are discovered and the decision is made to
delay corrective action. Discrepancies deferred due to non-availability of parts are promptly
loaded to MIS when backordered through supply. The decentralized supply support/material
control section enters supply data against deferred discrepancies and notifies the PS&D and work
center once parts are received. Discrepancies will not remain in "unscheduled" status for more
than 1 workday from the date of discovery. Discrepancies with a scheduled start date and time
greater than 5 days after the date of discovery are reportable deferred discrepancies.
Discrepancies scheduled but not accomplished on the date scheduled are counted and reported in
the deferred discrepancy rate. AWP discrepancies with a valid off-base requisition are reportable
deferred discrepancies. TCTOs, TCIs, SIs, and OTIs in deferred status are not reportable
deferred discrepancies.

14.20.3.1.1. (Added) The deferred discrepancy file, although centralized in the computer, is still
considered as two separate and distinct files: one consisting of discrepancies AWP, and the other
consisting of discrepancies AWM. The responsibility for maintaining AWM discrepancies in
MIS lies with the technician who makes the inputs. The MX Supt or designated representative
will develop procedures for reviewing the deferred discrepancy file and identifying any problem
areas requiring resolution. Constant monitoring of MIS (IMDS screen #380) is required to
ensure scheduled work is deferred again if not completed. The AWP file is maintained by
decentralized supply support/materiel control.

14.20.3.1.2. (Added) Equipment discrepancy files for equipment other than aircraft, may be
decentralized to the appropriate shop.

Table A14.1. (Added) ALC/DEPOT MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT
                                ALC/DEPOT

Chapter 1 - MANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY AND POLICY

1.1. Introduction. This section of the supplement covers only depot maintenance
organizations that accomplish depot maintenance (organic) and those organizations that arrange
for the accomplishment of depot maintenance (either organically or via contract). These
organizations may be part of the Air Logistics Centers' (ALC) structure or other specialized
groups or units under AFMC (e.g., AFGLSC). It excludes maintenance activities of tenant
organizations located on an ALC not assigned to AFMC or organizations under the Combat
Wing Organization/Non-Standard Organization (CWO/NSO) constructs. It is focused on
prescribing basic aircraft and equipment depot maintenance policy used throughout the AFMC
depot Maintenance Wings (MXWs) and other depot maintenance operations within the
Command. Any deviations from this guidance are prohibited without HQ AFMC review and HQ
USAF/A4L waiver/variance approval.

1.1.1. (Added) Management Philosophy. The Air Force requires depot maintenance capability
to support and sustain air, space, and cyberspace assets. AFMC is committed to sustaining a
modern, technically proficient and responsive depot structure. AFMC's depot maintenance
philosophy is to provide focused support to the warfighter through integrated use of public and
private sector capabilities; maintain infrastructure investments at a sustained level; continue to
invest in organic depot maintenance human capital to retain a professional work force; exploit
the use of state-of-the art technology and drive continuous process improvements to improve
efficiency, reduce costs while improving product and process quality. The management
philosophy is to accomplish depot maintenance in the most efficient and effective manner with
right mix of capability, skills, facilities and equipment; and ensure that products and services
meet quality, schedule and cost. Further, accomplishment of depot maintenance will reflect strict
environmental practices, attention to safety and quality of life for all employees.

1.1.1.1. (Added) Depot maintenance will strive to meet schedule, cost and quality of the
products and services it delivers. It will ensure that Operational Safety, Suitability and
Effectiveness (OSS&E) is achieved. Depot maintenance will invest in the resources (skills,
98                                           AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012


training, facilities and equipment) necessary to accomplish its mission in line with operational
customer requirements and with an overarching awareness of the systems and technologies being
acquired for future needs.

1.2. Organization. AFMC depot Maintenance Wings will organize according to AFI 38-101,
AF Organization, or as authorized by HQ USAF/A1M. AFI 21-101 authorizes civil service
maintenance functions to deviate from AFI 38-101, and it should be used as the basis for
organizational design. Contractor depot maintenance functions are not required to organize in
accordance with (IAW) AFI 38-101, but will implement the organization as outlined in their
proposal as accepted by the government.

1.2.1. (Added) In the event an intermediate repair activity is established at an ALC, the affected
MXW Commander/Civilian Leader may request authorization (via a waiver request) for the
intermediate repair activity organization to operate under the Combat Wing Organization (CWO)
guidance outlined in AFI 21-101. Waiver requests must be coordinated through the applicable
MXW Commander and routed through HQ AFMC/A4 Workflow to HQ AFMC/A4M for
coordination within HQ AFMC and final approval by HQ AFMC/A4. If this option is approved,
the affected unit must comply with all CWO requirements as outlined in AFI 21-101.

1.3. Aircraft and Equipment Readiness. As a contributor to aircraft and equipment readiness,
the functional definition of depot maintenance is: maintenance performed on materiel requiring
major overhaul or a complete rebuild of parts, assemblies, subassemblies, and end-items,
including the manufacture of parts, modifications, testing, and reclamation as required. Depot
maintenance serves to support lower categories of maintenance by providing technical
assistance, TO 00-25-107, Maintenance Assistance, and performing maintenance beyond the
responsibility of lower categories of maintenance activities. Depot maintenance provides stocks
of serviceable equipment by using more extensive facilities for repair than are available in lower
level maintenance activities. The depot maintenance function ensures aircraft and equipment are
safe, serviceable, and properly configured to meet mission needs. Depot maintenance actions
include, but are not limited to; inspection, repair, overhaul, modification, preservation,
refurbishment, troubleshooting, testing, and analyzing condition and performance. All levels of
supervision must place emphasis on safety, quality, and timeliness in the performance of depot
maintenance. The concept of quality depot maintenance must be fostered by each supervisor and
technician to ensure the integrity and skill of each maintainer is not degraded. To the greatest
extent possible, depot maintenance is accomplished on a preplanned scheduled basis. Planning
provides the most effective and efficient use of people, facilities, and equipment, reduces
unscheduled maintenance, and allows for progressive actions toward maintaining and returning
aircraft and equipment to safe operating condition.

1.3.1. Preventive Maintenance. Depot maintenance organizations must implement and manage
the tasks specified in the scheduled program for aircraft, equipment, components, commodities
and associated support equipment (SE) that are accomplished by the depot.

1.3.3. (Added) A key management philosophy is to employ critical safety item (CSI) tenets to
production processes and assure compliance to Aviation Critical Safety Items Management
Handbook on components/systems/equipment as defined by SPO/SPM Chief Engineers.
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012                                               99


Production leadership and planners shall ensure technical information (WCD flows, process
orders, process sheets, etc.) formulated internal to the MXW that affects CSI tenets, is approved
by the lead process technical expert, as appointed and assigned by the MXW/EN as well as the
SPO/SPM Chief Engineer, prior to use/change/modification. This shall provide assurances that
stipulated OSS&E are met.

1.4. Maintenance Concept. Depot maintenance, both functionally and physically, is part of
the Repair Network.

1.4.1. Requests For Assistance (RFA). If a depot maintenance activity receives a request for
assistance for evaluation and/or repair beyond unit capability, the request must be made IAW
AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status And Utilization Reporting, TO 00-25-107,
Maintenance Assistance, and TO 00-20-14, AF Metrology and Calibration Program, or
automated process as approved by the mission design series (MDS) specific system manager.
Depot maintenance responses to requests for assistance must be coordinated through the
appropriate cognizant engineer.

1.4.2. (Added) Repair Network. The ALCs and MXWs shall support the development and
implementation of the Repair Network Integration (RNI). The Air Force Repair Network is
organized into four hierarchal levels; repair enterprise, product repair groups, repair networks
and repair nodes. A repair network is a collection of repair nodes within product repair groups
that support the repair enterprise. The management of the repair network is comprised of the
Repair Network Manager (RNM) (who may reside in the ALC ASD organization) whose role is
to oversee and manage a collection of repair nodes within a specific product repair group. Node
Managers will reside within the MXW’s for all maintenance managed within the depots.

1.4.2.1. (Added) Repair Node. The Air Force Repair Node level is an individual organizational
unit within repair network(s). The role of the Node Manager is to oversee and manage all shop
activities pertaining to a specific Repair Node. The Node Manager shall:

1.4.2.1.1. (Added) Collect Repair Node Capability and Capacity (CAP2) data. The Node
Manager will also develop Production Plans to support RNM Workload Plans. The Production
Plan shall be provided to the RNM annually and when adjustments are made to the current plan.
The Node Manager will Provide the RNM with updates to CAP2 IAW workload allocation plans
and ensure data accuracy.

1.4.2.1.2. (Added) Manage Repair Node operations to support approved performance goals.
The Node Manager shall adjust Repair Node operations as required to meet performance goals.
The Node Manager will communicate production deviations which exceed agreed upon upper or
lower limits to RNM and chain-of-command. The Node Manager will provide mitigation
strategy to address negative performance deviations. The Node Manager will communicate
technical requirement changes via established processes to RNM and engineering as they
become known.

1.4.2.1.3. (Added) Execute Shaping and Sizing actions as defined in the approved Network
Shaping and Sizing Plan as approved by the governance structure. (Shaping and Sizing is a
100                                            AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012


process for recommending a rational structuring of the Air Force's capability and capacity
(manpower and infrastructure) to ensure an appropriate amount exists based on current and
future mission objectives.)

1.4.2.1.4. (Added) Ensure squadron/group/wing leadership has access to and/or is aware of all
communication exchanges with MAJCOMs and RNMs with regard to RNI processes, CAP2 data
inputs and workload allocation changes/plans.

1.4.2.1.5. (Added) Participate in CPI activities, and share results with RNM.

1.4.3. (Added) Depot Maintenance Concept. The concept of AFMC depot maintenance is to
provide quality, on-time and within cost depot level products and services of aerospace
equipment to its customers. The products and services will fully comply with technical data
requirements and meet OSS&E criteria. AFMC will use disciplined engineering practices,
strictly adhere to technical data, develop and sustain well-trained and motivated depot workforce,
use the correct tools and equipment, maintain a quality work environment and use strictly
disciplined processes. To further complement the intent of AFI 21-101, MXWs should pursue
industry standards to achieve quality and cost effective production (e.g., ISO9000).

1.7. Publications. ALC/MXWs will supplement this AFMC Supplement Depot Section with
local publications. Each MXW must tailor procedures to the unique aspects of its own depot
maintenance operations and publish directives for areas where more detailed guidance or specific
procedures will enhance operations. (The term "directives" includes instructions, supplements,
and, for functional areas, operating instructions IAW AFI 33-360, Publication and Forms
Management.) MXWs shall adhere to paragraphs 1.7.1 through 1.7.7 of AFI 21-101.

1.8. Waiver Request. The Maintenance Wing Commander/Director or Deputy, or equivalent
will coordinate on waiver requests to this instruction. Any activity that intends to deviate from
requirements in this instruction must submit a formal request to HQ AFMC/A4 using the format
in Attachment 10, AFI21-101. Send waiver requests to afmc.a4.workflow@wpafb.af.mil
(AFMC/A4 Workflow) or mail to HQ AFMC/A4, 4375 Chidlaw Rd, Bldg 262 WPAFB OH
45433-5006. If HQ AFMC/A4 approves, it is obligated to submit the waiver request to HQ
USAF/A4.

1.9. Field Supplements/Installation Publications ALC/MXW publications will assign
responsibilities, direct actions, and prescribe detailed procedures within a single subordinate
function (i.e., a staff office/section, a flight/branch, a squadron/division, etc.).

1.10.1.8. (Added) HQ AFMC/A4 is designated as the focal point for the Contract Depot
Maintenance (CDM) Program, the Contract Maintenance Program for Depot Maintenance
Activity (DMAG) and Contract Field Team (CFT) Program. HQ AFMC/A4D shall develop and
implement policy/procedures for overall management of these programs. Policy/procedures for
these programs are contained in AFMCI 21-149, Contract Depot Maintenance (CDM) Program,
AFMCI 21-113, Contract Maintenance Program for Depot Maintenance Activity (DMAG,) and
AFMCI 21-141, Contract Field Team (CFT) Program. Paragraphs 1.10.1.2 through 1.10.1.7 of
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012                                               101


AFI 21-101 apply.

1.10.2.5. (Added) AFMC Centers (including AFGLSC) shall comply with AFMCI 21-149,
Contract Depot Maintenance (CDM) Program, AFMCI 21-113, Contract Maintenance Program
for Depot Maintenance Activity (DMAG,), and AFMCI 21-141, Contract Field Team (CFT)
Program. Paragraphs 1.10.2.1 through 1.10.2.4 of AFI 21-101 as applicable.

1.10.3. (Added) Other Contract Depot Maintenance. Depot-level maintenance is also
accomplished via contracts that do not fall under the CDM Program, the CDMAG Program and
CFT Program and their respective AFMCIs. These contracts are typically part of Contract
Logistics Support (CLS) or Interim Contract Support (ICS) contracts established by program
offices. Reference AFI 63-101, Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle Management.

1.12. Maintenance Information Systems (MIS). MIS systems are clearly defined in TOs 00-
20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Policies, and Procedures,
00-20-2, Maintenance Data Documentation, and 00-20-3, Maintenance Processing Of
Reparable Property and the Repair Cycle Asset Control System. Non-maintenance systems are
considered management information systems which follow separate guidelines under separate
AFIs.

1.13. Communications. Effective depot maintenance requires efficient communication. Unit
commanders shall develop communication plans according to mission, security and information
assurance requirements.

1.13.1. Restrictions on carrying cell phones, radios, etc. apply to all persons working in a
critical foreign object damage (FOD) area, including mechanics, inspectors and all other persons
in the immediate area. Critical FOD potential areas include cockpits, flight controls, fuel cells
and other areas identified by the FOD Prevention Committee. Disputes regarding what
constitutes a FOD critical area will be resolved by the FOD Prevention Committee. Devices
prohibited from such areas may be stored in personal lockers or personal drawers. Prohibited
items do not include boom boxes, stereos and other sizable devices that do not pose a FOD risk.
Prohibited devices may be carried and used in the personal lock/drawer areas, rest areas and
other areas sufficiently removed from the FOD critical area.

1.13.1.1. (Added) Use of personal cell phone or communication devices is authorized in the
industrial/production areas except while performing hands-on maintenance activities.
Employees will remove themselves from any maintenance activity, aircraft, or high traffic areas
prior to using a communication device.

1.13.1.2. (Added) Use of portable music/video players (boom boxes, stereos and other sizable
devices), electronic games or other personal electronic hearing impairing devices is authorized in
industrial production areas except where audio warning cues are used.

1.14.2. MXW/CCs may waive duty shifts and rest period provisions during emergencies and
advanced readiness conditions.

1.15. Maintenance Training. MXWs will ensure depot maintenance training provides initial,
recurring and advanced proficiency, qualification, or certification skills needed by a technician to
perform duties in their primary series. The overall capability of a unit depends on the state of
training for maintenance personnel. Training is essential to improving and sustaining unit
capability and is one of the most important responsibilities of commanders and supervisors.
Commanders and supervisors must give priority support to training. When balancing resources,
(e.g., aircraft, support equipment, facilities, tools, funding, personnel), maintenance training
carries an equal priority with the production workload. For depot maintenance training policy
and guidance, refer to AFI 36-2232, Maintenance Training and Chapter 14 of this instruction.

1.15.1. Cross-Utilization Training (CUT). CUT is not used in the AFMC/MXWs. MXWs shall
utilize multi-skilling as applicable and appropriate based on local preferences, needs and labor
union considerations.

1.15.4. (Added) Depot Maintenance Training and Civilian Training. MXWs will ensure
training requirements are executed to support established training plan and individual Civilian
Training Plans and AFSC Career Field Education and Training Plans (CFETP). Ensure all
personnel complete the shop level Pollution Prevention (P2) Training Program and the
Environment, Safety and Occupational Health Management System (ESOHMS) training
requirements as applicable.

1.15.4.1. (Added) Air Logistics Centers Maintenance Wings are the Offices of Primary
Responsibility for the Depot Maintenance Training Program. A Maintenance Training Flight
(MTF) shall be established at the Wing Level. The Maintenance Wing Commander will appoint
in writing a Wing Maintenance Training Manager, Wing Civilian Training Plan Manager, Wing
Production Acceptance Certification (PAC) Program Manager, Wing Courseware Program

publish and distribute a MXG/CC/CL/CD approved plan monthly/quarterly. The E&I Plan will
be developed using the criteria listed below:

8.10.9.1.1. (Added) Consider historical PEs, QVIs, and other inspections data (especially any
items having a pass rate of less that 80 percent); not mission capable (NMC) causes; aborts and
trends; in-flight emergencies (IFE) and trends; high component or system failure rates;
repeat/recurring/CND discrepancies trends; Deficiency Report (DR)/ Service Report (SR) trends;
suspected training deficiencies; technical data violations (TDVs), detected safety violations
(DSVs), and tasks outlined in aircraft -6 TOs.

and minimum number of PE, QVI, Routine Inspection List (RIL) and other assessments to be
performed on a recurring basis.

8.10.9.7. (Added) Assessment areas. For the purpose of planning and conducting assessments,
major workloads will be broken down into assessment areas and documented in the QASP and/or
QAP (As applicable). Assessment areas are defined as segments or portions of a workload,
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012                                                125


system, component, process, procedure, or subject matter that is investigated, inspected,
evaluated or audited.

8.10.9.8. (Added) Minimum Number of Assessments. The methodology (e.g. ANSI- Z1.4 2003)
or rationale used to determine type (i.e., task specific item, procedure or process) and minimum
number of PEs, QVIs, and routine inspections to be performed will be documented in the
Maintenance Wing QA Manual, QAP or QASP.

8.10.9.9. (Added) Acceptable Quality Levels (AQL) /Standards. A standard is the acceptable
quality level (number of minor defects) that can be considered satisfactory as a process average
or conforming to established criteria.

8.10.9.9.1. (Added) An AQL standard denotes the maximum allowable number of minor
findings for any assessment. It must be strict enough that the task, process, or product meets an
acceptable level of quality, but is not so strict that a QAR-1 rating is unattainable. The AQL
standard is derived from QA performance- based data. Quality Assurance will develop
procedures for determining minimum AQL standard levels delineating an “attainable” quality
level. These levels will comprise the AQL standards for all assessment types.

8.10.9.9.2. (Added) Failure to meet an AQL standard results in the assessment being rated as a
QAR-3, failure. An identified major finding would also result in an assessment being rated as a
QAR-3.

8.10.11.2.   CAT II minors shall be documented for trends, and will be counted against the AQL.

8.10.13.3.1. (Added) UCR. An unsatisfactory condition is defined as an event/discrepancy that
requires immediate supervisory intervention to ensure safety or process/product fit, form, or
function reliability. Unsatisfactory conditions are deemed major and will be documented as a
UCR. A condition of a minor nature shall be documented against the applicable checklist or its
regulatory guidance.

8.10.14. Personnel Evaluations (PE). A PE is a direct evaluation on any PAC certified
personnel (Note: Personnel evaluations for industrial services and non-critical support personnel
is optional at local discretion). QA will provide notice not less than one hour prior to the
evaluation. QA will determine what task will be evaluated. The PE will be on work in-progress
or work about to begin. Use PEs to evaluate job proficiency, degree of training, and compliance
with technical data. PEs will be used to evaluate newly certified personnel/teams, process
changes to include the new processes and procedures and equipment changes. Individuals
performing or certifying PAC maintenance tasks are subject to a PE. Rate PEs “pass” or “fail”
based on established AQLs/standards. Document the PE on AF Form 2419, Routing and Review
of Quality Control Report, MIS, or in the MAJCOM-approved database. Ensure personnel
performing maintenance on aircraft/equipment pass a PE every 24 months. Failed evaluations
will result in a re-evaluation within 30 days of recertification of failed task. Supervisors will
notify QA when recertification is accomplished.

8.10.14.1. The PE will include an evaluation of the individual’s training records, tool box,
126                                            AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012


TMDE and TO. General maintenance practices that relate directly to the task being performed
(e.g., safety, material handling, use of tools and equipment, Foreign Object Damage prevention,
Electrostatic Discharge prevention, and workmanship) will be examined during the PE. Other
maintenance practices may also be examined as locally determined.

8.10.14.1.2.1. (Added) The team task is rated as an overall pass or fail. Team evaluations will
be scored the same as PEs. During team evaluations, errors committed by team member(s) and
not detected by team chief may also be attributed to the team chief.

8.10.14.2. Individuals or team members will be immediately decertified (on the evaluated
task) by their supervisor for a failed PE rating in accordance with applicable training
regulations. Determine ratings as follows:

8.10.15.1. Rating QVIs. Rate QVIs “pass/QAR1” or ‘failǁ/QAR3” by comparing the number of
discrepancies with the established AQLs/standards.

8.10.15.1.3.1. (Added) Each QVI is chargeable to the technician or supervisor who stamped the
WCD, signed off/cleared the “corrected by” block or “inspected by” block of the applicable
maintenance form or equipment record. When evaluating the technician who stamped the WCD
or signed off the “inspected by” block, evaluate only the items normally verified by stamping the
WCD or signing off the “Red-X” in the A/C Forms.

8.10.16. Special Inspections when driven by the analysis of assessment data may be conducted
at the discretion of the local QA or requested by MXW/CC/CL/CD, MXG/CC, Branch Chief,
SQ/CC or work center supervisors. Additionally, observed deficiencies beyond the scope of an
inspection in progress not meeting the criteria of a DSV, TDV or UCR will be recorded in
QIMSS under the category of Special Inspection. SIs will be assigned a rating (QAR-1 or 3)
based on severity of the observation. SIs are designed to provide a flexible tool to complement
other quality assessment types.

8.10.16.1. (Added) Individual Tool Kit (ITK) inspections will be performed at the beginning or
end of shift and avoid impact to production to the maximum extent possible. Personnel will be
afforded reasonable time to replace tools/items to appropriate location(s) and to replace damaged
expendable tools prior to beginning ITK inspections.

8.10.18. Acceptable Quality Levels (AQL/Standards). When establishing the AQL consider at
least six months of data on evaluations performed, and other pertinent data. Consider combining
items of equipment within a general equipment type having nearly identical standards. QA has
the option to create an AQL formula for inspecting only a portion of a task once a baseline
standard for a large task is established (e.g. aircraft phase/ISO inspection has an AQL of 6, if QA
inspects 50% of the task, the AQL would be 3).

8.10.19.5. Key Task List (KTL)/Q Stamps.

DEV 8.10.19.8. In lieu of high-missed carded items the ALCs will use failed QVI data.
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012                                               127

material and other key areas that affect the process. The process review should include
participation from EN, GK, Business Office, QA, Safety, Environmental and other SME’s as
required. QA may perform PEs, QVIs and applicable LCAT checklists during the process
review. QA findings will be documented on AFMC Form 343’s, Control and Processing or
other local quality forms. A final written report will be produced at the conclusion of the process
review. An AFSO 21 8 Step event may be required after the process review to address needed
countermeasures and corrective actions.

8.11. Lead Command-approved QA database. Data Collection. QIMSS will be used as the
tool for collecting and compiling QA data collected by QA personnel. This data will be reviewed
monthly to analyze results, identify trends, and will be reported to management in the
appropriate forum. This information will allow management to make informed and responsible
decisions about the quality system. The organization assessed is responsible for ensuring the
corrective and preventive action is entered into QIMSS. Personnel using QIMSS must be trained
to the extent necessary to effectively use the system. NOTE: Oversight inspections (e.g. Policy
Oversight, Activity Inspections, etc) may be captured in Access, Excel or an automated MIS.

responses to deficiencies and needed improvements are critical. A system of identifying
deficiencies in maintenance processes and bringing solutions to bear on them is essential and
must be developed at each center. Quality assistance can be requested by anyone submitting an
AFMC Form 77. Forms and procedures for processing the AFMC Form 77 will be made readily
available to the maintenance work force.

8.30. (Added) AFMC Form 343, Control and Processing. Quality assessment data will be
documented on the computer generated AFMC Form 343 and recorded in QIMSS. The QIMSS
database collects, indexes, files, stores and maintains applicable AFMC Forms 343 data.

8.30.1. (Added) Processing. Timely corrective/preventive action is required to ensure problems
are identified and corrected. QA must input the assessment into QIMSS within one work day
(24hrs). The suspense date for corrective/preventive action is 10 work days, beginning the next
work day after the defect is input into QIMSS and ending with acceptance of
corrective/preventive action by QA. The production maintenance function is responsible for
ensuring corrective/preventive action is initiated as soon as possible and input into the QIMSS
database.

8.30.1.1. (Added) Extension of Suspense Date. Local policies and procedures will be developed
and documented in the Maintenance Wing Quality Manual for extension of suspense dates.
Extensions will be recorded and tracked in QIMSS.

8.30.2. (Added) Follow-up Assessments. Depending on the severity of the discrepancies the
COR, QA supervisor, or management may direct specific follow-up actions. Results of follow-up
assessments will be recorded in QIMSS. Follow-up assessment procedures will be documented

can be either administrative or workmanship related. Specific decertification criteria shall be
established and documented at the local level as needed to ensure consistency among employees.

14.38.8.1. (Added) Administrative Decertification. Decertification for administrative reasons is
based on such things as non-performance of the task for a prolonged period (As determined by
the supervisor and the employee), personnel reassignments, medical conditions, workload
changes, failure to pass SSQ re-qualification or overdue recurring requirements.

14.38.8.2. (Added) Workmanship Decertification. Decertification for workmanship reasons is
based on such things as failure to comply with technical data and other applicable directives,
valid customer complaints or feedback (both external and internal), PAC related mishaps, invalid
certification of WCD, lack of proficiency, and as required by Chapter 8 and TO-00-35D-54,
USAF Deficiency Reporting and Investigating System, Category I Deficiency Reports caused by
workmanship.

14.38.9. (Added) Recertification Criteria. Recertification is accomplished once the conditions
of decertification have been resolved or removed. The certifying supervisor determines the
criteria to be used for recertification. As a minimum, a demonstration of proficiency of the task,
or portion of the task, that resulted in the decertification shall be accomplished. The supervisor
shall review all decertification to determine if the employee is required to re-attend formal
training in order to meet the recertification criteria.

shall be given the opportunity to challenge the validity of any of the information in the PAC
record. When an employee is moved from one supervisor to another, the gaining supervisor
shall conduct a review within 30 days of assignment and annually thereafter.

14.38.11. (Added) Certifying WCDs. All WCDs shall be stamped and dated In accordance with
Chapter 19. Certification of tasks shall be performed by someone PAC certified in that specific
task. Personnel not certified on the task being performed can accomplish the work if they are
qualified to the extent necessary and are under the guidance of a PAC certified mechanic or
technician.

(Added) NOTE: Supervisors accepting work by certifying WCDs for maintenance tasks shall
meet the same training, qualification, and certification requirements as the PAC certified
employee and shall require a PAC record.

14.38.11.1. (Added) Secondary Certification. Secondary certification (second set of eyes) shall
be applied and is required for all critical tasks, with the following exceptions: where SSQ tasks,
due to their very nature, do not allow for secondary certification, (i.e., some non-destructive
testing, welding, and soldering tasks), or where it is impossible to inspect or witness the
accomplishment of the task (e.g., engine run on single seat fighter aircraft, etc.) a single
certification by a fully SSQ qualified and certified mechanic or technician is acceptable. Second-
ary certification shall be accomplished on the applicable WCD using one of the inspection codes
identified in Chapter 19. Secondary certification requires two PAC certified employees to
inspect the work performed, stamp and date the WCD.

14.38.12. (Added) Non-Routine Work Certification Criteria. Non-routine work is workload that
has not been in production for such a long period of time that PAC certified employees are no
longer available. When non-routine work is reintroduced and a PAC certified employee is no
longer available the supervisor will certify a journeyman technician to perform the task(s).

14.38.13. (Added) Multitask, Subtask and Team Task Certification. This shall be done by
multiple annotations on the WCDs as specified in Chapter 19 and local directives.

14.38.14. (Added) PAC Documentation. TSS-PAC is the source data for PAC and shall be used
for all official purposes such as audits, investigations, and inspections. The TSS-PAC PMO will
impound the TSS-PAC records in case of mishaps, formal investigations or when directed by
higher authority. Certification/decertification/recertification changes made in Section III of an
employee's PAC record are not an official part of the record until the employee and supervisor
verify them by PIN or signature. Administrative Decertification’s due to non-performance or
overdue training when the employee is not available for pinning may be accomplished but must
be explained within TSS-PAC Sec IV. If depot work is performed where TSS-PAC is not
available, use of printed copies is permitted. When PAC personnel go TDY to perform depot

Product Repair Manager (PRM) and RNM.

17.3.3. When a Repair Network is established, CRF commodity distribution will be a
collaborative effort between the PRM, RNM, AFGLSC, DLA, and Repair Nodes. Production
serviceable assets are released per SPRS sequence and changes to this are coordinated through
the appropriate MAJCOM. The repairable assets should be distributed per the collaboration
effort. The serviceables should be distributed by SPRS.

17.3.5. When a Repair Network is established, the RNM will coordinate requirements with the
AFGLSC Supply Chain Weapon System Teams to monitor enterprise health of the managed
commodities. Negative trends will be dealt with IAW Repair Network policy.

17.3.8. Repair Enterprise Managers (PRM/RNM, etc) will develop clear guidance on
Metrics/Status reporting requirements for the commodities within the Repair Enterprise as
outlined in Repair Network policy. Metrics/Status Report requirements will be accomplished by
the RNM and coordinated as outlined in Repair Network policy.

and off-equipment maintenance/repair functions) repair, calibration, overhaul, or inspection of:
aircraft, aerospace equipment, aircraft engines, support equipment/tools, conventional munitions,
nuclear munitions, missiles, vehicles, components, and other non-flying weapon systems and
related activities. This chapter shall be used in concert with AFI 63-101 and other applicable
guidance, Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), etc, (or the instruction in existence at the time
of contract award) This includes contracts totaling $250K or more.

18.1. Government Contract Quality Assurance. COR is used to describe all government
personnel appointed to provide surveillance of service contracts.

18.1.1. AFMC units to include Maintenance wings (ALCs), maintenance groups/maintenance
divisions (test wings and AEDC) and air base wings which have performance-based maintenance
or maintenance support activities shall establish a single, centralized program management office
(PMO) also known as Contract Management Office (CMO). In the ALC, the MXW PMO office
may be located with the MXW/QP. For installations which have performance-based
maintenance and maintenance support activities shared between two or more wings, the wing
which established the contract will be responsible for overseeing and managing the contractor’s
performance. The PMO will consist of a full time, dedicated staff to initiate, oversee and manage
performance-based activities within the maintenance wing/group. The PMO will consist of a
program manager(s), COR chief(s) and COR(s). The Chief COR may serve as both the program
manager and Chief COR when the workload does not justify both positions. Additionally
ACO/PCOs who administer the performance-based maintenance contracts may be assigned to
the PMO to ensure a comprehensive team focused on administration and management of the
contracted operations. The office may include subject matter experts from various functional
areas (e.g., CE, communications, contracting, finance, plans, and logistics). All contracts will be
coordinated with the PMO to ensure consistency and standardization of PWSs and to minimize
the number of contracts for similar operations.

18.1.1.1. (Added) The PMO will:

18.1.1.1.1. (Added) Develop guidance for and coordinate on all Performance Plans (PP).

18.1.1.1.2. (Added) Ensure adequacy of training program for CORs and track training to ensure
currency for Functional Commander/Functional Directors (FC/FD), Chief CORs and CORs.

18.1.1.1.3. (Added) Coordinate on all service contracts to ensure contractor operations at least
meet minimum AF standards.

18.1.1.1.4. (Added) Ensure adequacy of Performance Work Statement (PWS)/Statement of
Work (SOW) by utilizing S.M.A.R.T. concept. The performance threshold is a standard of an
acceptable level of performance set for a task. Performance thresholds set clear, measurable
points that the contractor can easily recognize as measures of performance. To be considered
effective thresholds must meet certain criteria. A simple way to remember the threshold criteria
is to use the acronym, SMART where “S” stands for Specific, “M” for Measurable, “A” for
Attainable, “R” for Realistic and “T” for Time-bound. When the threshold does not meet these
criteria, it is most likely to be ineffective and immeasurable. This concept, when utilized, will
ensure the PWS/SOW captures specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and timely (SMART)
goals for the contractor and their quality assurance plan.

18.1.1.1.5. (Added) Avoid multiple contracts for the same or similar operations.

18.1.1.1.6. (Added) Ensure AF maintenance standards are included in the PWS/SOW where
practicable. These standards include but are not limited to: tool control, FOD prevention, safety
(where government resources are exposed to risk by contracted operations), tool and equipment
management, and materiel control.

18.1.1.1.7. (Added) Ensure AF maintenance data collection and information management
systems such as IMIS, FEMS, AMCS, IMDS, CEMS, G081, SBSS, and AFEMS are mandated
in the PWS where practicable.

18.1.1.1.8. (Added) Conduct a quarterly review of activities with COR chief(s), CORs and
ACO/PCOs.

18.1.1.1.9. (Added) Develop local procedures to ensure standardized Performance Management
Assessment Plan (PMAP) and documentation.

18.1.1.1.10. (Added) Keep up-to-date on mission changes that could affect creation of a contract
modification and advise the Multi-Functional Team (MFT) to include the FC/FD.

18.1.1.1.11. (Added) Oversee the development of a PMAP that effectively measures and
evaluates contractor, MEO, or HPO performance throughout the life of the contract or
management plan.

18.1.1.1.12. (Added) Ensure PMAP implements the requirements of applicable guidance and
this chapter.

18.1.1.1.13. (Added) Review problem areas with the (MFT) to resolve the problems. If the
problem cannot be resolved, advise the FC/FD and request assistance through command
channels.

18.1.1.1.14. (Added) Review documents related to default/re-compete prior to scheduled
recompetition; PWS requirements document or scope of work modifications; changes to award
fee plan (if applicable); contractor, MEO, or HPO proposals to new or revised DoD, AF,

Chapter 19 (Added) - TECHNICAL DATA AND WORK CONTROL DOCUMENT
(WCD)

19.1. (Added) Introduction. This supplement provides policy and procedures for depot work
planning and the use of technical data in compliance with Air Force policy. This document also
provides guidance for processing, handling, and storage of WCDs. This document supersedes all
other guidance pertaining to WCDs if a conflict exists.

19.1.1. (Added) General.

19.1.1.1. (Added) Only current and verified Technical Data, as authorized by TO 00-5-1, shall
be used for depot maintenance. Local procedures shall be developed to control other forms of
technical data when extracts are made (i.e. engineering drawings/mylars, D-2 drawings, Process
Specifications, commercial maintenance manuals [CMM], commercial off the shelf [COTs],
etc.). These policies/procedures shall be approved by the MXW. In the absence of written
policy, a locally printed TO extract may only be used on the day it is printed. Locally printed
Technical Order extracts may be used for thirty calendar days if the maintenance wing has a
written policy.

19.1.1.2. (Added) Use of unapproved technical data (such as notes, manuals, drawings, emails,
etc.) including uncontrolled copies (or pages) of formal TOs is prohibited.

19.1.1.3. (Added) Specific TOs take precedence over general TOs. When specific TOs do not
contain procedures or processes, such as cleaning, plating, etc., general TOs containing this
information will be used. If there is a difference in requirements between these documents, the
more stringent requirement applies.

19.1.1.4. (Added) The current version of TOs shall always be used. For all dual based TOs
(hard copy and electronic distribution) the units shall consider the “medium of primary use” at
the point of maintenance (POM) as the current version. For aircraft in storage at AMARG, use
technical data prescribed by the requesting authority.
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012                                                 205


19.1.1.5. (Added) WCD Focal Point. Each ALC MXW, or equivalent, designates the WCD
Focal Point. This individual is the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for WCD program
directives and assists all production groups with WCD program requirements.

19.1.1.6. (Added) When a Depot MXW production area is required to perform maintenance
using a TO identified as "preliminary" the System Program Manager/Supply Chain Manager
(PM/SCM) Chief Engineer shall authorize the use of the “preliminary” TO(s) IAW AFI 63-101,
Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle Management, and TO 00-5-3, AF Technical Order Life
Cycle Management.

19.1.1.6.1. (Added) Engineering red-line changes to technical data already in sustainment shall
have an AFMC Form 202, Nonconforming Technical Assistance Request and Reply, and/or
SH252 initiated authorizing the use of the 'red-line' TO. For contractor engineering red-line
changes to contractor CMMs (Commercial Maintenance Manuals) when the Air Force is
performing as a partner under a CLS agreement, a letter from the contractor engineer shall be
required authorizing the use of the red-line changes to a contractor developed and distributed
CMM.

19.2. (Added) Technical Data.

19.2.1. (Added) Work specifications, such as statement of work (SOW), etc. are not an
authorized source of technical data.

19.2.2. (Added) Contractor Technical Data. Contractor supplied technical data may be used
when the depot maintenance organization is acting as a sub-contractor in accordance with TO
00-5-1. Depot maintenance personnel shall use contractor data when CLS/Contractor Support
(CS) contracts provide for Air Force assistance to the contractor or when operating or
maintaining equipment at sites or locations not covered by the contract. The contractor’s
provided data and source data as defined in TO 00-5-3, AF Technical Order Life Cycle
Management are authorized for use provided the cognizant engineering authority has approved
their use and the production planning team has concurred the data is valid for performing the
work required. Referencing of this type of data on WCDs is considered valid proof of
authorization for use. The cognizant engineer, or SPO engineer shall ensure currency of
contractor tech data. Local procedures shall be developed to determine the disposition of
contractor’s technical data after the contract has ended.

19.2.3. (Added) Technical Data Availability. O&M technical data procedures for operation,
troubleshooting, repairing, removing, installing, manufacturing, calibrating, or servicing action
must be available and used at the job site as prescribed by TO 00-5-1. General TOs and Methods
and Procedures TOs (MPTOs) need not be at the job site except when there is contractor support.
All MPTOs listed in the SOW and directive upon the contractor must be readily available at the
job site.

19.2.3.1. (Added) Used at the job site. Technical data shall be in the area where the work is
being performed (i.e., work bench, aircraft stall, dock, machine shop, etc.). Job site is
determined by the nature of the task.
206                                           AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012



19.2.4. (Added) TO Changes and Authorized Deviations. Technical data used in depot
maintenance must be complete, accurate, effective, and efficient. It is the responsibility of
maintenance personnel at all levels (including SPO personnel) to ensure deficiencies are reported
in a timely manner and improvements made when authorized. When work cannot be performed
using the TO as written, an authorized deviation must be processed and approved. The AFTO
Form 22, Technical Manual (TM) Change Recommendation and Reply, is processed in
accordance with TO 00-5-1 or the AFMC Form 202, Nonconforming Technical Assistance
Request and Reply, is sent to the appropriate engineering/ planning function which processes the
request in accordance with AFMCMAN 21-1, Air Force Material Command Technical Order
System Procedures.

19.2.4.1. (Added) AFTO Form 22. This Form provides the mechanism by which improvements
and corrections to TO deficiencies may be made. TO 00-5-1 provides detailed instructions on
the routing of TO deficiency submissions. It is the responsibility of the individual discovering a
TO deficiency to initiate an AFTO Form 22.

19.2.4.2. (Added) AFMC Form 202, Nonconforming Technical Assistance Request and Reply.
Use the AFMC Form 202, Nonconforming Technical Assistance Request and Reply, to furnish
technical data for (a) conditions or procedures beyond published authority under work stoppage
and non-work stoppage conditions, and (b) when technical data does not exist and must be
developed, approved, and provided to maintenance technicians. Use procedures in accordance
with AFMCMAN 21-1, Air Force Materiel Command Technical Order System Procedures, for
the preparation, use, and control of AFMC Form 202, Nonconforming Technical Assistance
Request and Reply.

19.2.4.3. (Added) AFTO IMT 252, T.O. Publication Change Request. An approved AFTO
IMT 252, Technical Order Publication Change Request, may be issued as a result of an
approved AFMC Form 202, Nonconforming Technical Assistance Request and Reply, when a
TO change is required to provide the correct or newly developed data necessary to resolve an
actual or anticipated work stoppage. The completed AFTO IMT 252 is stamped Special
Handling (SH252) and is processed and inserted into the TO as detailed in AFMCMAN 21-1, Air
Force Materiel Command Technical Order System Procedures, and is used until replaced by the
formal TO update.

19.2.4.4. (Added) AF IMT 3925, Engineering Order (EO). An EO is used to document changes
to engineering drawings as described in AFI 21-402, Engineering Drawing System, and
AFMCMAN 21-1.

19.2.5. (Added) Posting TO Changes. Changes to TOs must be monitored and documented,
ensuring no process is compromised. The organization responsible for posting changes to TOs
will publish and provide a list of changes to the appropriate engineering organization, production
supervisor, and planning organization. Changes to TOs may require changes to the WCDs and
Process Orders. The planning, production, and engineering organizations are jointly responsible
for reviewing the TO changes and the determination of WCD impacts. Changes to WCDs and
Process Orders shall be accomplished within fifteen working days after formal posting of the TO
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012                                               207


change.

19.2.6. (Added) Work Control Document (WCD). WCDs are not technical data. The WCD is
an official and authorized document with the technical data reference. No work will be
performed without an approved WCD. The WCD is the official record for work including
control, identification, inspection, and routing of items. A WCD shall be developed for all
programmed and temporary workloads. This ensures there is a complete audit trail of work
performed. ALC MXWs performing host tenant support workloads including preventive
maintenance type support workloads not included in the FEMS can develop procedures for
documenting maintenance actions accomplished by certified MXW technicians. WCDs shall be
auditable and meet the requirements of this instruction. The level of auditability may be
determined by locally developed procedures. The amount of detail and technical data references
on WCDs is determined by the Pre-Production/Production Planning Team (PPPT) and is
dependent on the type of work, complexity of work, and repetitiveness of the work assigned.
Unpredictable WCD’s that are developed and processed thru the MWR system do not require
PPT review unless requested.

19.2.6.1. (Added) If there are conflicts between the WCD and the technical data, the technical
data shall prevail.

19.2.6.2. (Added) WCD review will be performed IAW local supplement.

19.2.6.3. (Added) As determined by the Production Planning Team (PPT) when IAW is used on
the WCD, the technical data must be open and in use. Depending on the nature of the task being
performed, when approached the technician will have correct and approved technical data open
to the applicable area in work. The performing technician will be able to point to the task being
accomplished in the technical data but need not be on the exact page. Critical tasks/operations
identified by the PPT will be IAW tasks/operations.

19.2.6.4. (Added) All Warnings, Cautions, and Notes will be reviewed prior to performing the
task or at the beginning of each shift. Review Verification Status Pages (VSP), when present, to
check the verification status before attempting to use any procedure per TO 00-5-3.

19.2.6.8. (Added) Any technical data referenced by the PPT shall be complete and directly
related to the work being accomplished. The PPT determines the WCD technical data references
and it may include paragraphs, tasks, and steps needed to perform the work; however,
paragraphs, tasks and steps are not required. The WCD is the official record that certified
technicians required by the PAC Programs performed the task(s) using authorized technical data.
WCDs will contain the complete technical data alpha numeric designated number when used.
Technical data abbreviations are not authorized.

19.2.6.9. (Added) When the primary technical data applies to every operation of the repair
process it is not necessary to repeat the technical data reference for each sub-operation. Other
technical data referenced in the primary technical data are not required to be listed on the
operation line. Operations that require the use of independent technical data shall be referenced
in the operation description block. Any operation not listing independent technical data reverts

to the primary technical data.

19.2.7. (Added) WCD Change Request.

19.2.7.1. (Added) AFMC Form 957, Work Control Document (WCD) Change Request, is
prescribed to identify additions, deletions, and corrections to an existing WCD. It may also be
used to recommend action be taken to create a new WCD. MXWs shall develop local
procedures on tracking WCD changes when AFMC Form 957 is not used.

19.2.7.1.1. (Added) The person identifying the need for a change on the WCD will initiate the
request to Planning by completing AFMC Form 957, Part 1. For administrative changes (i.e.
typos, spelling, grammar, etc.), this process is not required.

19.2.7.1.2. (Added) The signature and organization symbol of the initiator’s supervisor is
required. When changes to a Resource Control Center (RCC) are required, both the old RCC
and new RCC supervisor’s signatures will be required.

19.2.7.1.3. (Added) The supervisor will forward the request to the appropriate planning
organization.

19.2.7.1.4. (Added) The responsible Planner/IET will complete the following actions within 15
working days:

19.2.7.1.4.1. (Added) Complete Part II of the request indicating the request was accepted, or
explain why the request was not accomplished.

19.2.7.1.4.2. (Added) Input changes to the WCD as required.

19.2.7.1.4.3. (Added) Return a copy of the completed request to the supervisor.

19.2.7.1.4.4. (Added) Maintain AFMC Form 957 electronically or in planning jacket for a
minimum of two years.

19.2.8. (Added) Pre-Production Planning, New Workload. For each new
programmed/negotiated workload, the MXW/CC requires establishment of PPPT composed of
Planning Element Chief or designee, Wing Business Office, Cognizant Engineer (OSS&E
authority), applicable MXW Engineering, RCC Production Supervisor(s) or designee(s), QA
Specialist (COR) and other representatives (i.e. DLA, material support specialist, safety,
bioenvironmental, Nuclear Weapons Resource Officer (NWRO), scheduling, training, PAC
manager, etc.) as required. See Logistics Requirement Determination Process (LRDP) website.
www.gao.gov/archive/1996/ns96070.

19.2.8.1. (Added) The cognizant engineer or designee will chair the PPPT. Pre-production
personnel are responsible for the initial resource development and identification of critical end
items for exchangeables and brochure required critical tasks for aircraft, workplace facility
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012                                                209


layouts, process flow charts, bill of material requirements, work breakdown structure and
associated WCDs, labor standard operations, identification of training and certification
requirements for production personnel, review of all hardware and software technical data,
review of all associated equipment and hand tools, review of all special processes, finalization of
direct cost, reporting of shortfalls that prohibit organic start and requesting work authorization
documents for programmed/negotiated workload start.

(Added) NOTE: It is important that the planning committee members have a thorough working
knowledge of the maintenance industrial repair/overhaul process. In addition, a thorough
understanding of all maintenance organizations and their responsibility to each other is required.

19.2.8.2. (Added) For organizations operating under the Maintenance Requirements
Supportability Process (MRSP), the strategic team created will fulfill the requirement for PPPT.

19.2.9. (Added) Production Planning Team (PPT).

19.2.9.1. (Added) The PPT purpose is to further develop, plan and refine workload
requirements as they pertain to WCDs. The team is composed of a Planner/IET and the RCC
Production Supervisor or designee. When requested, the Production Controller/Scheduler, QA,
and appropriate Engineer will attend PPT meetings.

19.2.9.2. (Added) All formal PPTs will use AFMC Form 500, Work Control Document
Production Planning Team Checklist, when developing or reviewing WCDs. The responsible
planning organization will maintain the completed form(s) electronically or a completed hard
copy form(s). The Planner will maintain the completed AFMC Form 500 as part of the
permanent record. The AFMC Form 500 will serve as PPT meeting minutes. The AFMC Form
500 is the final and official record of the PPT and issues/concerns about the developed WCD
shall be identified as a possible recommendation for review by members who originally signed
the form. Attach any required documentation to AFMC Form 500 as needed that supports the
PPT. A round table is not required for formal coordination.

19.2.9.2.1. (Added) The AFMC Form 500, Work Control Document Production Planning Team
Checklist, will be used to document review of Contractor supplied WCDs. A round table is not
required for coordination. Completing AFMC Form 500 electronically is encouraged. The form
is available at the following link: http:/www.e-
publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFMC500.xfdl. Instructions for completing AFMC
Form 500 are provided in Table A14.8.

19.2.10. (Added) Types of WCDs. The following are the only authorized types of WCDs for
production maintenance. Deviations are NOT authorized without prior HQ AFMC/A4D written
approval. WCDs comparable to Inventory Tracking System (ITS) and AFMC Form 959, Work
Control Document, AFMC Form 173, MDS/Project Operation Assignment, shall comply with
the requirements of this instruction.

19.2.10.1. (Added) AFMC Form 959, Work Control Document. Inventory Tracking System
(ITS) (G337), IMPRESA, Networks MTO, Maximo (G029), AFMC Form 173, MDS/Project
210                                            AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                   26 APRIL 2012


Operation Assignment, or Programmed Depot Maintenance Scheduling System (PDMSS)
(G097), and Management Planning and Control System (MPCS) formally known as D012 are
used for workloads processed through production maintenance. These forms will not be used for
the repair and certification of TMDE work. The WCD will be attached to the item throughout
the production process, or will be placed in a designated location, for those items where
attachment is not practical. (See Table A14.4. – Instructions for AFMC Form 959.) (See Table
A14.5. – Instructions for AFMC Form 173.)

19.2.10.2. (Added) Sequential Tasks. Tasks are accomplished and certified in step-by-step
sequences; however, deviation is permissible based on the nature of the task. The deviation will
not create a conflict with the technical data source and integrity of the task accomplishment will
not be compromised. Any task determined by the PPT as requiring sequential steps shall have
the following (or equivalent) statement on the WCD or definitized list: “Tasks must be
accomplished and certified in step-by-step order”.

19.2.10.3. (Added) All unpredictable AFMC Forms 173 will be processed through Maintenance
Work request (MWR) for approval.

19.2.10.3.1. (Added) A Work Emergency is defined as a situation when MWR/PAO are not
available where accomplishment avoids work stoppage or delays of aircraft flow time.
MRT/Planner approval must occur the first business day, following this condition, to formally
meet, approve, and comply with coordination requirements on the WCD. The Aircraft Logistics
Specialist (ALS) or designee and production foreman will make this determination. Local
publications shall be developed to ensure the work emergency WCD is documented and
controlled.

19.2.10.3.2. (Added) Definitized List. Use G097 at the URL site:
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=MC-LG-00-31 and in the DM-
SUM-A007-020, Software User’s Manual, for information to complete definitized lists. A
definitized list supplements AFMC Form 173 and shall be attached to and become a permanent
part of the AFMC Form 173 throughout the production process. Definitized lists must be
updated and the task description must be in agreement with the source AFMC Form 173. It
provides a detailed step-by-step breakdown of the process. AFMC Form 959/ITS/D012 may be
used as a definitized list for AFMC Forms 173.

19.2.10.3.3. (Added) The AFMC Form 173 will be assigned an inspection code applicable to
the work being accomplished, as determined by the PPT. AFMC 173 header cards for definitive
guides containing multiple skills will be coded as administrative . The person stamping the
source 173 is certifying that the tasks/operations on the definitized list are stamped and dated. If
the PPT determines that the header card is an administrative task/operation, the scheduler will
certify that all certification blocks on the definitized guide have been stamped and dated by “C”
stamping the WCD.

19.2.11. (Added) Electronic WCDs. HQ AFMC approved computer systems generated WCDs
without hard copies are authorized and encouraged as long as the accuracy and integrity of the
documents can be maintained and the minimum documentation is accomplished as required by
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012                                               211


this and other applicable instructions. Automated Data Processing Systems (ADPS) that have the
capability, electronic completion, and certification of WCDs shall include PAC and supervisory
certifications. These systems must have sufficient built-in safeguards (PINS, electronic
signatures, passwords, firewalls, etc.) to ensure system integrity and security are maintained and
that a reliable audit trail is maintained. The records shall be maintained in accordance with Air
Force Records Information Management Systems (AFRIMS) at
https://w.w.w.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rds/rds_series.cfm .

19.2.12. (Added) Contractor Supplied WCDs. Contractor supplied/distributed WCDs used by
Air Force personnel shall be utilized IAW this instruction. Local supplements may be developed
to address unique contractor WCD requirements such as form number, design, format, etc.

19.2.12.1. (Added) PPT Review of Contractor’s WCDs. The PPT review of contractor WCDs
shall consist of the Planner, applicable Production RCC, Controller/Scheduler, and designated
workload QAR. Additional representation from the following organizations should be
considered wherever a contractor’s WCD is reviewed: Safety, Bio-environmental, and the
contractor. The PPT review shall ensure technical data is identified and available, applicable
critical tasks/operations are identified, and personnel have the required skills to perform the
maintenance task.

19.2.13. (Added) Level of Effort and other Non-MISTR (Management of Items Subject to
Repair)/Non-PDM (Programmed Depot Maintenance) Workloads. The AFMC Form 959 may
be used when no end item product is produced and no other WCD process is feasible. Local
procedures may be developed on how this form will be used and filled out for these specific
requirements.

19.2.14. (Added) Technical Information on WCDs.

19.2.14.1. (Added) Technical Data Usage Requirement. All WCDs requiring PAC certification
(M, I, E, and N Coded) must contain the technical data reference applicable to the work being
performed.

19.2.14.1.1. (Added) General maintenance tasks/operations not covered by technical data and
performed by mechanics shall require the statement “Technical Data Not Required”, or
equivalent, on WCDs.

19.2.14.1.1. (Added) Technical data, called out on the WCD, may reference additional TOs or
drawings necessary to accomplish task. Due to space constraints on AFMC Form 173, the
primary TOs may be the only ones referenced on the WCD. When the primary tech data applies
to every sub-operation of the repair process it is not necessary to repeat the tech data reference
for each sub-operation. Other tech data referenced in the primary tech data are not required to be
listed on the sub-operation line. Sub-operations that require the use of independent tech data
shall be referenced in the sub-operation description block. Any sub-operation not listing
independent tech data reverts back to the primary tech data.

(Added) NOTE: The term “Technical Data” shall not be interpreted to mean the same as the
212                                            AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                   26 APRIL 2012


term “TOs.” (See Glossary of References and Supporting Information.)

19.2.14.1.2. (Added) Specifications and Tolerances on WCDs. Including specifications,
tolerances, and any similar information verbatim from the governing technical data into any
WCD will be held to an absolute minimum. The intent must not be to enable using WCDs in
lieu of the official technical data. Justification for inclusion of this type of data on WCDs is
based on a significant gain in efficiency and/or productivity, or a clear reduction in the chance of
using the wrong specifications or tolerances or avoids possible misinterpretation or
miscalculations of these values. Specifications/tolerances are not to be confused with MIL
Specifications, stock numbers or part numbers.

19.2.14.1.2.1. (Added) WCD operations determined critical by the PPT or identified as IAW
shall not have any specification, tolerance, or other similar information identified within the task
description block

19.2.14.1.2.2. (Added) The responsible Planning Element shall maintain a control log of all
WCDs containing specifications and tolerances. At a minimum this log will identify the WCD
control number and date of last PPT review, technical data number, basic date, the change date
and change number. If the technical data changes the WCD shall subsequently be changed.

19.2.14.1.2.3. (Added) The planner shall manually update all changes to WCDs on the
production floor and annotate the following (or equivalent) statement in RED at the top of the
WCD header page “NOTE: WCD specification updated due to a technical data change.”

19.2.14.1.2.4. (Added) The planner shall notify the production organization identifying the
applicable WCD was updated because of a recent technical data change.

19.2.14.1.2.5. (Added) Engineering, planning, and production are responsible for reviewing
technical data changes and determining the impact to WCDs containing specification and
tolerances.

19.2.15. (Added) Data Collection on WCDs. Provisions will be made to annotate
measurements, laboratory/test results, entries on AFTO Form 95, Significant Historical Data,
time changes and calendar inspection items complied with, on the WCD or attached data sheet
when such annotation is required IAW TO 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance
Inspection, Documentation, Policies, and Procedures. Requirements can be generated by
technical data, the PPT, work specifications, quality plans, or when a precise audit trail is
needed. Data sheets used to annotate measurements or laboratory/test results will be attached to
the WCDs.

19.2.16. (Added) Inspection/Certification Codes. These are codes utilized for determining the
type of Inspection/Certification required on a WCD. The only authorized Inspection/Certification
Codes are listed in Table A14.7.

19.2.16.1. (Added) A maintenance stamp is mandatory and shall be used to indicate work
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012                                                213


completion and certification. Use of initials and employee numbers are not permitted.

19.2.16.2. (Added) Critical Task/Operation Identification. Maintenance performed by AFMC
personnel will be reviewed to identify critical maintenance tasks/operations. Critical
tasks/operations designated for secondary PAC certification must be listed and stamped as
separate line items. The PPT identifies critical tasks/operations as any task/operation that affect
form, fit and function, and has an inspection/certification identified by the cognizant engineering
authority, and production planning team. If not done correctly, can result in one of the following
conditions:

19.2.16.2.1. (Added) A catastrophic failure of an end item.

19.2.16.2.2. (Added) An end item failure that may affect safety of flight.

19.2.16.2.3. (Added) Where end item failure may present an imminent safety/health hazard or
affect a life support system.

19.2.16.2.4. (Added) Any failure of a critical safety item (CSI).

19.2.16.2.5. (Added) Any item containing TO direction for addition or removal of software
(CPIN loading or removal) which if not performed would compromise functionality and/or
foreign or national security.

19.2.16.3. (Added) Secondary Certification. Secondary certification (second set of eyes) is
required for all critical tasks/operations. They can also be used as a designated inspection tool to
help control problem/high dollar tasks, provide measurement, FO/closing inspections, QDRs,
and improve processes. Secondary certification shall be accomplished on the applicable WCD
task/operation using either an “E” or “I” PAC certification codes identified in Table A14.7. The
“I” secondary PAC inspection code is not to be restricted to IPI that is mandated by MAJCOM,
TO, or local management directives, but will be used when technical data conformance cannot
be verified after task/ operation completion. Where secondary certification is required for tasks
that are visual in nature such as FOD inspections the technician performing the secondary
certification must also perform the task . The following can be considered when identifying
secondary certification:

19.2.16.3.1. (Added) Cautions and warnings which may have associated task/operation that is
critical in nature.

19.2.16.3.2. (Added) Other items in the technical data that meet the criticality criteria.

19.2.16.3.3. (Added) Mishaps and other safety reports/alerts, and investigations involving the
workload that identify critical areas.

19.2.16.3.4. (Added) Previously identified problem areas from similar workloads.

19.2.16.3.5. (Added) Deficiency reports, especially category one, and other customer feedback.
214                                            AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012



(Added) NOTE: There are some SSQ tasks that by their very nature do not allow secondary
certification. In addition, there are those where it is impossible to inspect or witness the
accomplishment of the task. Mandatory SSQ task/operation except those that are non-critical
must be considered when identifying these requirements along with any other sources that are
available for specific workloads.

19.2.16.4. (Added) Production closures of end items that will be installed on aircraft, aircraft
closures, non-enclosed areas where safety of flight could be compromised and major component
mating operations. A WCD task/operation or definitized list for performing a Rag/FO inspection
will be used. Include the statement “Rag/FO inspection C/W” on the WCD. Production closure
of end items that require closing/rag/FO inspections do not require a separate WCD or
definitized list. Centers may use an equivalent Rag/FO inspection statement on the WCDs and
definitized list. If technical data or TO provides guidance, a separate Rag/FO inspection
task/operation is not required. The technical data or TO will be annotated as IAW on WCD.
Area will be immediately temporarily/permanently secured following the closing/ installation
inspection.

19.2.16.5. (Added) After the initial work planning process is complete, the first level supervisor
or higher has the primary responsibility for identifying additional operations for secondary
certification requirements. The Planner/IET must work closely with the responsible supervisor
to ensure all critical items identified in the technical data are included. Changes in workload
requirements and technical data must be carefully screened for tasks/operations that meet the
criticality criteria.

19.2.16.6. (Added) Multi-task/Operation, Task/Operation and Team Task/Operation
Certification. Local procedures must be developed to document work accomplishment for tasks
that are accomplished by several individuals and/or for all work accomplished by more than one
person due to shift change. When possible, the same individual or crew should perform multi-
task/operation work to maintain continuity. For multi-task/operation, task/operation, and team
task/operation certifications, the person performing the last task/operation must certify on the
WCD that the portion they performed was done correctly and verifies all previous
tasks/operations have been stamped. Every effort will be made to document who performed
specific portions of the tasks/operations so that accountability can be maintained.

19.2.16.7. (Added) Changing Inspection/Certification Codes. Inspection/Certification codes
can only be changed, in-work, by the following functions:

19.2.16.7.1. (Added) Production supervisor can perform a one-time upgrade to an
inspection/certification code if a secondary certification is desired. The production supervisor
will also affix a “P” stamp and date above the inspection block or locally identified area.

19.2.16.7.2. (Added) A COR can add a Q code above block 29 of the AFMC Form 173 or in the
“Other/Insp” (third column) of the definitized list. On the AFMC Form 959 the COR can add a
Q in block 20, third column identified with a “Q” and on an ITS equivalent WCD, the COR will
add a Q to the right of the current certification code block. All Q entries will be done in Red.
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012                                               215


The COR will affix a stamp and date next to the manually entered Q code on the applicable
WCD. Only COR is authorized to downgrade a Q code.

19.2.16.7.3. (Added) The Planner and Production Supervisor as the PPT must make any
downgrades to an inspection/certification code unless the operation is critical or coded Q. This
change will be done in Red and the Planner and Production Supervisor will affix their stamps
and date above the code or locally identified area. Justification for the change will be annotated
on or attached to the WCD. To downgrade critical operations the PPT must review and
coordinate on the AFMC Form 500, Work Control Document Production Planning Team
Checklist.

19.2.17. (Added) Local procedures will be developed for hand written tasks/operations added to
WCDs on shop floor.

19.2.18. (Added) FCF and Maintenance Operational Checks (MOC) Documentation will be
IAW TOs 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance General Policy and Procedures, and 1-1-
300, Acceptance/Functional Check Flight and Maintenance OPR Checks.

19.2.19. (Added) Rework. Collection and analysis of rework data is essential to promoting
efficient and effective processes. Rework is any work that is being re-accomplished to repair or
replace failed material or end items, or to correct a work discrepancy, where the discrepancy is
the direct result of incorrect workmanship; after the acceptability or completion of the work
task/operation , or end item has been stamped on the WCD by production personnel. Also
reference AFMCI 21-156, Operational Workloading, Planning and Scheduling Control.

19.2.19.1. (Added) Documentation of Rework. (AMARG will develop local procedures to
comply with rework documentation.) The WCD is flagged with one RED diagonal line drawn
through the inspection certification block of the specific WCD operation where the workmanship
defect or deficiency exists. The WCD is stamped and dated in the inspection certification block.
When it is necessary to rework an item, the item and the accompanying WCD retreat to the first
step requiring re-accomplishment, then the normal sequence is followed to completion.

19.2.19.2. (Added) A rework WCD is generated that includes all operations/tasks that must be
re-accomplished and is attached to the original WCD. All rework operations/tasks are re-
accomplished, stamped, and dated. Production count is not taken for rework.

19.2.19.3. (Added) All WCDs used for rework will contain the header information of the
original WCD. WCDs will be annotated REWORK on the header of the WCD in Red.
Electronically generated rework WCDs do not require REWORK in red.

19.2.20. (Added) Routed Items. (AMARG will develop local procedures to comply with routed
items.) Routing may be classified as either job routing or process routing. Routing may involve
multiple RCCs, or may occur within a single shop.

19.2.20.1. (Added) Job Routing. AFMC Forms 127, Routed Order, and AFMC Forms 137,
Routed Order (PROJ DIR). AFMC Forms 127/137 or automated system produced equivalent
216                                            AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012


shall be used when designated by the PPT to furnish routing and data to/from aircraft and support
shops. When items are aircraft specific, the MDS and complete aircraft serial number (e.g.
C130J 86-0092) shall be included along with the item control number, part number and item
serial number. AFMC Forms 127/137 are not to be used in lieu of a WCD. If the routed item
work to be accomplished requires the performance of a maintenance task, an approved WCD
will be developed or provided to the mechanic/technician for performance and certification of
the maintenance task identified. Items routed between organizations using Routed Order
documents require the tasked organizations to develop a WCD in compliance with this
instruction. Retention of AFMC Forms 127/137 is not required as a depot historical record for
aircraft or support shops since all work performed will be documented and certified on approved
WCDs.

19.2.20.2. (Added) Process Routing. Process routing, which consists of forwarding an item to a
process shop, is an integral part of the overall repair effort, but isn’t considered a job route. A
process shop is defined as a depot maintenance function that provides conditioning support on
component assemblies and materials, or essential support services for end items being repaired
by other depot maintenance organizations. The following are examples of candidates for process
routing: cleaning, plating, heat treat, welding, battery servicing, grinding, machining, NDI,
check/test, and minor maintenance.

19.2.20.3. (Added) Local procedures can be developed for back shop/commodities related
routed items as required.

19.2.21. (Added) Non-programmed work. Non-programmed work is work authorized by
AFMC Form 206, Temporary Work Request. AFMC Form 206 requiring maintenance shall
have an approved WCD. The G004L-L3A will not be used as the WCD.

19.2.22. (Added) Deficiency Report Data. Deficiency data reported IAW TO 00-35D-54,
USAF Deficiency Reporting and Investigating System, (to include aircraft/engine acceptance
discrepancies), must be analyzed by the Production Group QA Office. Technical data and WCD
problems contributing to reported defects must be corrected. Changes to these documents must
be formally requested and tracked to ensure effectiveness as part of the corrective actions, as
appropriate. The QA program must provide feedback to managers and supervisors.

19.2.23. (Added) Condemned Parts WCD Documentation. When a part is condemned the
technician condemning the part will stamp and date the appropriate WCD certification block, and
enter in the specific task/operation description block the word “condemned”, and include the
word “condemned” on the first page of the WCD. No technician documentation is required for
operations that will not be completed due to parts condemned.

19.3. (Added) Roles and Responsibilities.

19.3.1. (Added) Depot Field Team (DFT) Activities. See TO 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment

19.3.2. (Added) PPT. The PPT WCD and technical data responsibilities are as follows:

19.3.2.1. (Added) Assist in the development of the WCD for programmed workloads.

19.3.2.2. (Added) Provide and receive input between Groups for routed items.

19.3.2.3. (Added) Review inspection/certification codes, technical data and safety requirements.

19.3.2.4. (Added) Identify in the WCD any task as determined by the Chief Engineer of a
weapon system or lead engineer of an end item, as critical, using the definition of a CSI as
guidance. A CSI is defined as a part, an assembly, installation equipment, launch equipment,
recovery equipment, or support equipment for an aircraft or aviation weapon system if the part,
assembly, or equipment contains a characteristic where any failure, malfunction, or absence of
which could cause a catastrophic or critical failure resulting in the loss or serious damage to the
aircraft or weapon system, an unacceptable risk of personal injury or loss of life, or an
uncommanded engine shutdown that jeopardizes safety. CSIs include items determined to be
“life limited”, “fracture critical”, “fatigue sensitive”, etc. Damage is considered serious or
substantial when it would be sufficient to cause a “Class A” accident or a mishap of severity
category I. The determining factor in CSIs is the consequence of failure, not the probability that
the failure or consequence would occur. Items formerly identified as “flight safety part”, “flight
critical part”, “flight safety critical aircraft part”, or “safety of flight item” are considered CSIs.

systems/components inoperable or disassembled for long periods of time).

19.4.1.6. (Added) When Process Orders exceed the maximum number of pages, an attachment
may be used to continue the process order.

19.4.2. (Added) Development of Process Orders. Local procedures shall be developed by the
appropriate engineering organization for preparation, control, monitoring, distribution, and
deletion of all Process Orders. Process Orders will be controlled as technical data in production
areas. The applicable engineering organization shall maintain the Process Order master file. The
Process Order number will be determined locally. Process Order shall be prepared according to
direction in Table A14.6.

19.4.2.1. (Added) The applicable engineering organization and the PPT determine Process
Order requirements. The applicable engineering organization is the OPR for the development of
Process Orders. Engineering can request technical expertise from organizations as required. For
mandatory coordination and signatures of Process Orders refer to Table A14.6. Coordination
office and signatures from applicable organizations will be shown on the Process Order.
Electronic coordination is authorized for all coordinating and approving officials.

19.4.2.2. (Added) If a Process Order contains verbatim TO information the Process Order will
be reviewed each time the subject TO is changed for currency. If the Process Order does not
contain verbatim TO information the Process Order will be reviewed every two years for
currency. The OPR will update process orders as required and the distribution function will
update the master Process Order index.

19.4.2.3. (Added) When technical data is changed the engineering organization shall initiate a
review within fifteen working days of when the change is formally posted to the applicable
technical data. If the technical data change results in a change to the Process Order the following
statement or equivalent shall be entered at the top of block 11 of the AFMC IMT 561, Process
Order: NOTE: Process Order Updated Due to a Technical Data Change.

19.4.2.4. (Added) The Process Order shall be updated to reflect the latest technical data change
dates and change numbers even if there were no changes affecting the procedures contained on
the process order. If no Process Order procedures have been affected, process engineers may
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012                                                223


update title page with tech data version date and change number without re-coordinating the
entire Process Order.

19.4.2.5. (Added) Process Orders containing technical data (i.e. torque values, dimensions,
tolerances, specifications) shall be monitored to ensure that when technical data changes are
made the applicable Process Order is reviewed and updated. Engineering, planning, and
production are responsible for reviewing technical data changes and determining the impact to
Process Orders.

19.4.2.6. (Added) Process Orders shall not compromise form, fit, or function of an aircraft,
missile, or commodity without proper formal coordination and approval from the cognizant
engineering authority. The appropriate engineer will sign the AFMC IMT 561 block 13.

19.4.2.6.1. (Added) Local procedures may be developed for engineering red-line changes to
Process Orders.

19.4.2.7. (Added) The applicable Engineering organization will ensure the Process Order
contains the required ‘Warning, Cautions, and Notes”.

19.4.2.8. (Added) A Process Order containing verbatim technical data information shall have

Process Orders shall contain on the front page a Distribution Statement, Export Control Warning,
and Destruction Notice.

19.4.2.9.1. (Added) Distribution Statement. If the Process Order is tied to a TO, use the same
distribution statement as the TO. If the Process Order is tied to more than one TO, use the most
stringent distribution statement among the TOs. If the Process Order is not tied to a TO, or any
other document incorporating a distribution statement, then the developing engineering office
will assign the appropriate distribution statement. (Refer to AFI 61-204, Disseminating
Scientific and Technical Information, and TO 00-5-1, AF Technical Order System, to determine
and assign the applicable distribution statement).

19.4.2.9.2. (Added) Export Control Warning. Use “WARNING—Export Controlled”.

19.4.2.9.3. (Added) Destruction Notice. Use “Destruction Notice—Destroy by any method that
will prevent disclosure of contents or reconstruction of the document.”

19.4.2.10. (Added) Prior to Process Order formal implementation and distribution the applicable
engineering organization will schedule a formal Process Order validation/verification (val/ver).
The val/ver will be performed by production and requires 100 percent hands-on performance of
all procedural (operational, maintenance, calibration, equipment set-up, etc.) tasks contained
within the Process Order. The Process Order val/ver will be documented and maintained by the
224                                           AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012


applicable engineering organization for a minimum of two years.

(Added) NOTE: Process Orders developed prior to this change are exempt from performance of
validation/verification as these Process Orders have been in use in maintenance production areas.

19.4.2.11. (Added) After the appropriate engineer develops/approves the process order and
ensure a val/ver were performed (see paragraph 19.4.2.10) the Planner shall ensure the process
order number is identified on the required WCD, and to the task/operation requiring the use of
the process order.

19.5. (Added) Stamps.

19.5.1. (Added) Stamps are issued to maintenance personnel to denote status on WCDs.
Maintenance stamps will be issued to maintenance personnel to certify, by stamping and dating,
that work has been accomplished and completed as required by specified technical data. Any
time a maintenance stamp is used the stamp impression will be dated.

19.5.1.1. (Added) Local publications will be developed to retain control of maintenance stamps.
As a minimum, local publications will include the following:

conditions for use. (Reference Table A14.7.)

Chapter 20 (Added) - DEPOT MAINTENANCE PRODUCTION SUPPORT quanity

Section 20A-Overview

20.1. (Added) Purpose. This chapter contains policies and procedures required to conduct
Depot Maintenance (DM) production support activities for aircraft, exchangeables
(commodities), Other Major End Items (OMEI) (missiles, engines, etc.), and associated
components/parts. These activities are grouped into several DM categories to include
Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM), Modification (MOD), Unprogrammed Depot Level
Maintenance (UDLM), unpredictable, and exchangeables requirements. It specifically addresses
the overall philosophy, policies, procedures, organizational structure, key personnel duties and
responsibilities, key functional area requirements, and systems necessary to perform DM
production support within USAF guidance. For the 309th Aerospace Maintenance &
Regeneration Group (AMARG), procedures in this instruction pertaining to data systems are not
applicable. AMARG will continue to use the commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products in place
of the legacy systems used at the Air Logistics Centers (ALCs). References to Defense Logistics
Agency (DLA) material support functions apply to all groups within DM with the exception of
AMARG & Kadena that follow AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual. Also, for the
applicability of this Chapter to the Software Maintenance Group (SMXG) and the Maintenance
Support Group (MXSG), see Section 20D and Section 20E, respectively. This policy will be
226                                            AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012


supplemented by each ALC with local operating instructions.

20.2. (Added) Philosophy. DM exists to support the warfighter. It provides this support by
applying its resources to keep the mechanic on task. DM strives to apply the right resources at
the right time at point-of-use to execute a warfighter needs-driven production plan and schedule.
Process improvement results, in turn, assist in determining personnel duties/responsibilities,
organizational structure, enterprise software configuration requirements, facility requirements,
and other DM requirements. In simpler terms, all DM activities must be process improvement-
based, must keep the mechanic on-task, and must optimize warfighter support. Key tenets for
DM include:

20.2.1. (Added) Standardized repair process (reduced flow days).

20.2.2. (Added) Focus on throughput (constraint management).

20.2.3. (Added) Support on the shop floor (Production Support Flight).

20.2.4. (Added) Synchronized backshop repair.

20.2.5. (Added) Proper allocation of manpower/skills.

20.2.6. (Added) Daily repair based on greatest AF need.

20.2.7. (Added) Defined roles and responsibilities.

20.3. (Added) Policy. This chapter contains functional policy for DM performed by the
Maintenance Wings (MXWs) at the USAF’s ALCs and the functional relationships with support
organizations (e.g., Air Force Global Logistics Support Center (AFGLSC), System Program
Office/System Program Manager (SPO/SPM), and DLA). Compliance is mandatory unless a
waiver is approved per Chapter 1, paragraph 1.29. HQ AFMC/A4D is OPR for this chapter
and will provide clarification of DM policy. The OPR will accomplish an annual review of this
chapter during the anniversary month of this publication to ensure its content is current, accurate,
and relevant. The OPR will also coordinate changes to this chapter through HQ AFMC/A4.

20.4. (Added) DM Support Process. This section describes the DM process as developed
during the Depot Maintenance Transformation (DMT) initiative. This process “leaned out” and
standardized the Aircraft and Depot Repair Enhancement Processes previously established by
AFMCI 21-129, Depot Maintenance Management, Depot Repair Enhancement Process (DREP)
and AFMCI 21-133, Depot Maintenance Management For Aircraft Repair (superseded by this
supplement). The DM process supports all assets currently and potentially subject to DM and is
therefore generic yet meaningful. There are two sub processes included in the support process:
Pre-Production and Production Support. All DM sub processes and support functions are
described in the following sections to include each function within the sub processes (e.g.,
Production Planning).
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                   26 APRIL 2012                                                 227


20.5. (Added) DM and Material Systems. Personnel will use the HQ AFMC designated
standard maintenance and material systems to manage and support DM.
20.5.1 Requirements Management/Configuration Management (RM/CM) Process. A detailed
description can be found in the Requirements Management Plan for the Logistics Process on the
HQ AFMC/A4N Systems Integration Division Community of Practice (CoP). All requirements,
whether a new requirement, system discrepancy, or technical upgrade, require that a
Communications and Information Systems Requirements Document (CSRD) be written using
the Information System Management Tool (ISMT). For HQ AFMC, the CSRD must flow
through the HQ AFMC Integrated Requirements Review Board (IRRB) approval process with
HQ AFMC approval being the IRRB, chaired by the HQ AFMC/A4 Deputy Director,
Maintenance. After a CSRD is approved by the IRRB, it moves on to the Air Staff equivalent of
the IRRB, labeled the Air Force Logistics Requirements Board (HQ AFMC/A4RB) process,
leading to final approval for implementation or disapproval of the CSRD. A list of these

Section 20B-Production Support for Exchangeable Repair

20.10. (Added) Purpose. This section outlines the DM production support functional policies
required to effectively operate and manage depot exchangeable repair processes and workload.
The overarching purpose is to standardize the basic repair processes for ALC organic depot level
repair and overhaul.

20.11. (Added) Organizations and Functions.

20.11.1. (Added) Squadron Commander/Director (formerly the Fixer). Is the single person
accountable and responsible for assets in the production shop and the assigned resources to
accomplish depot repairs. Using standard repair processes, is responsible for production output
for their shop(s).

20.11.1.1. (Added) Has overall responsibility for the workload, planning, scheduling, and
quality control in support of repair, production, overhaul, and manufacturing processes. Includes
determining capacity parameters in EXPRESS to uphold the supportability function of the
automated repair execution process.

20.11.1.2. (Added) Provide supervision, operational direction, and guidance to the maintenance
shop chiefs and the Production Support Flight to ensure the most productive and cost effective
methods are used to produce a timely and quality product that maximizes serviceable asset
availability.

20.11.1.3. (Added) Is responsible for managing resources required to perform programmed and
non-programmed workloads; will respond when the automated Supportability Module of
EXPRESS considers repair to be constrained based on insufficient shop capacity. Capacity
constraints are revealed daily in two EXPRESS output reports: the Supportability Report and

20.11.1.4. (Added) Chair the Exchangeable Meeting (formerly DREP) which is an informal
meeting (as required) that discusses constraints and provides overall maintenance and production
assessment to support the repair process; report status at a monthly Group level meeting.
Weekly/bi-weekly meetings are strongly encouraged.
238                                           AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012



20.11.1.5. (Added) Form and manage depot field teams, when tasked, to provide worldwide
support for customers, TCTO requirements, and TO 00-25-107, Maintenance Assistance,
requests. (Reference AFMCI 21-120, Organic Depot Field Teams.)

20.11.1.6. (Added) Control what is inducted into maintenance. Duties may be delegated to the
Production Support Flight. It is also within the Squadron Commander’s/Director’s authority to
determine when end items are taken in or out of on work order (OWO) status. The Squadron
Commander/Director must weigh customer requirements with the level of risk he is willing to
accept. The Squadron Commander/Director decides when to take an item off OWO and place in
the AWP store (remains on the “M” (maintenance) balance). Maintenance assumes the risk that
the repair requirement will be satisfied through another avenue while awaiting delivery of AWP
components every time an end item is taken off OWO due to AWP. If the repair requirement is
satisfied, AWP-G/F condition end items may begin to stack up in storage because they no longer
have a requirement. Even if the backorder is cancelled, most of the end items will have had
some work performed on them that can only be recouped by the CSAG-MD if repairs are
completed and ultimately a sale transacted. Strict adherence to existing policy and the following
policy clarification will reduce the AWP backlog, capture true costs associated with depot repair,
capture accurate consumption data needed to facilitate stockage of replacement items, and allow
mechanics to perform repairs on required assets.

20.11.1.7. (Added) DM activities are barred from inducting assets (exceeding the net repair
objective) to cannibalize as a source of supply for repair parts not available through normal
supply channels. Parts needed to effect repairs will be requisitioned from the supply system. If
repair parts are not received in a timely manner, the Squadron Commander/Director may seek
relief by asking the AFGLSC to fund carcass cannibalization with an AFMC Form 206,
Temporary Work Request. (See AFMCI 21-130, Depot Maintenance Material Control.) Thus,
maintenance is paid for work associated with cannibalization and all demand data is captured in
the applicable data systems. Under no circumstances is the Squadron Commander/Director
authorized to induct beyond the repair objective for the purposes of cannibalizing parts unless a
funded AFMC Form 206 is provided. The AFGLSC will provide the disposition and supply
condition code of all assets inducted for cannibalization purposes when the work is completed.

20.11.2. (Added) Production Support Flight (PSF).

20.11.2.1. (Added) General. This section provides guidance and direction for operating a
Production Support Flight (PSF). The PSF manages the planning, scheduling, and AF DM
material activities required to support execution.

20.11.2.2. (Added) The PSF provides the following support (not meant to be all-inclusive):

20.11.2.2.1. (Added) Order material; provide status/follows up on selected items.

20.11.2.2.2. (Added) Issue received material to the shop.
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012                                               239


20.11.2.2.3. (Added) Determine when item enters and exits AWP.

etc.)

20.11.2.2.5. (Added) Plan programmed and unplanned workload

20.11.2.2.6. (Added) Maintain DM repair BOMs.

20.11.2.2.7. (Added) Measure shop performance.

20.11.2.3. (Added) The Induction Process. All end items driven into repair or drawn into repair
are assigned a 14-position end item document number through D035K. The end item document
number stays with the end item until it is turned in to supply. The assets will be tracked using
the same document number. Likewise, D035K, G402A, and G337 will use the same document
number to account for reparables. The Scheduler will monitor and coordinate with the DLA
Customer Support Specialist (formerly RIM) on delinquent in-transits.

20.11.2.4. (Added) The quantity per transaction (D7M) will always be “one each” to facilitate
end item tracking. Workloads inducted with job designators “J” and “L” are exempt from the
one-per-induction rule. Other workloads are exempt with an approved waiver.

20.11.2.5. (Added) Ordering From Supply. To order material, use standard operating procedures
and systems. Use ABOM/NIMMS as the input system for material ordering. All shops must
provide the end item document number, Standard Reporting Designator (SRD), and Required
Delivery Date (RDD) with all requests. By including the end item document number on each
issue request, D035K will react by linking the end item and component/piece-parts internally.

20.11.2.6. (Added) The end item document number is assigned by D035K and can be found on
the WCD produced by G337. The SRD can be obtained from the AFTO Form 350, Repairable
Item Processing Tag, the REMIS table, or the TO. The user provides the required delivery date.

20.11.2.7. (Added) When ordering parts, use the end item document number of the end item
being repaired to ensure the right parts are linked to the right end item. D035K will edit end item
document numbers against the database for end item document numbers.

20.11.2.8. (Added) All backorders against an end item are now considered AWP backorders
regardless if the end item is in AWP or OWO status. D035K will automatically code piece-parts
and/or component requisitions as AWP, with project code “AWP” and advice code “6N” when
the end item document number, SRD, and RDD are entered on the issues request.

20.11.2.9. (Added) Bench Stock/Residual Materiel. Bench stock and residual materiel are two
examples of maintenance owned bit-and-piece parts to be used before any additional bit-and-
piece-parts are ordered. Production Support Technicians (PSTs) will query D035K to check if
item is supported by Industrial Product-Support Vendor (IPV) prior to placing parts orders.
240                                           AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012


20.11.2.10. (Added) Other Sources of Materiel. When traditional sources fail to provide
required parts by the required delivery date, maintenance or DLA may opt to use other sources
for parts support. These other sources include approved cannibalization and save lists, local
purchase, or local manufacture.

20.11.2.11. (Added) Local Purchase. For local purchase procedures, see AFMCI 21-130.

20.11.2.12. (Added) Local Manufacture. Parts catalogued with a National Stock Number (NSN)
can be locally manufactured when the designated source of supply cannot meet the delivery date.
Coordinate local manufacture with the source of supply. A funded AFMC Form 206 (T-Job)
along with the appropriate blueprints/drawings must be provided for local manufacture. Local
manufacture items must be properly documented and demand data must be captured and input
into the supply system.

20.11.2.13. (Added) Cannibalization of Inducted Items. Cannibalization of inducted items is
the removal of an installed assembly, subassembly, component, or part from one inducted item
for use on another item with the intention of replacing it. Approval for Cannibalization of
inducted items is within the authority of the Maintenance Group (MXG). A Cannibalization of
inducted items occurs when a component ordered against an End Item/End Item Document
number has to be file maintained to another End Item/End Item Document number because the
component was robbed as applicable. Production Managers are not authorized to over-induct
end items (in excess of the Net Repair Objective) for the express purpose of cannibalizing parts.
(See AFMCI 21-130 for cannibalization procedures.)

20.11.2.14. (Added) Reclamation. Reclamation is the recovery of parts for further use from end
items or excess assemblies. Parts removed by reclamation are generally not replaced and the end
item may not be identifiable for turn in. Reclamation will be used instead of procurement or
repair by the source of supply, after considering cost, whenever it provides the quickest means of
satisfying a MICAP or other critical item requirements, or when there is no other known source
of supply. (See AFMCI 21-130 for reclamation procedures.)

20.11.2.15. (Added) AWP Policy (See AFMCI 21-130, AFMAN 23-110, Vol. III, Part 2,
Chapter 6, and AFMC Supplement to AFI 20-110 for NWRM assets).

20.11.2.15.1. (Added) When all the component parts have been received or canceled, D035K
will automatically change the AWP-G to AWP-F (fully supportable). D035K will output a
notification of the condition change, parts will be delivered, and work can be completed. The
EXPRESS system will drive supportable AWP assets prior to requesting a DLA asset to be
shipped to maintenance.

20.11.2.15.2. (Added) Moving AWPs off Work-Order. A transaction will be processed to move
the end item off the JON OWO and into AWP. The ZFA/L will be processed in D035K to load
the AWP storage location. The backorders for parts/components will be file maintained
automatically. Next, D035K will pass a D7 RF/PK to G402A to move the end item from OWO
to AWP-G. All AWP end items will be maintained on the “M” balance.
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012                                               241



20.11.2.15.3. (Added) Uninstalled parts in the shop for the end item will be returned with the
end item. If possible, the parts returned from the shop should be stored with the end item;
however, if there is no room or it is not practical, they may be stored in a separate area. Each
part/component must be identified to a particular end item and cannot be co-mingled with parts
from another end item.

20.11.2.15.4. (Added) AWP Supportable Notification. When an AWP end item becomes 100%
parts supportable, D035K will generate an information notice. This is notification that the last
backorder against a given end item has arrived (or cancelled) and the asset is ready to return to
repair.

20.11.2.15.5. (Added) Moving an End-item from AWP to OWO. Once the last backorder is
received, D035K codes the end item “FWP” or 100% supportable. G402A is used to transfer
AWPs to OWO when the end item move notice is received from D035K.

20.11.2.15.6. (Added) End Item Turn-In Processing. When turning in an asset, the Scheduler
will use the same end item document number created when the asset was brought into repair.
D035K checks for existing backorders marked against the end item document number. If
backorders exist, the system responds with a controlled exception “AK” notifying the user of
existing backorders. DLA coordinates with maintenance prior to file maintaining or cancelling
the backorders with this exception.

20.11.2.15.7. (Added) AWP Get-Well Efforts. Existing supportable end items must be worked
off before additional carcasses are drawn in for repair. D035K has been programmed to facilitate
the drawdown of FWP assets by first selecting end items coded FWP before other carcasses.
Where systems miss opportunities to induct 100% supportable AWP/FWP coded assets; the
scheduler must intervene in the process and draw available assets into repair. Which assets and
the number of those moved are at the discretion of maintenance.

20.11.2.15.8. (Added) AWP Reconciliation. DLA will complete an annual AWP reconciliation.
The purpose of this reconciliation is to ensure proper accountability of AWP end items, piece-
parts on hand, and piece-parts on order. Use existing DIOH/AWP management reports to
complete this reconciliation. The AWP Reconciliation will be coordinated with maintenance and
scheduled by DLA.

20.11.2.15.9. (Added) Long lead-time AWP assets will be addressed during the Exchangeable
meetings. These assets will be maintained on the “M” balance. Maintenance will coordinate
with AFGLSC for disposition.

20.11.2.15.10. (Added) Storing Assets. DLA will store and control serviceable components,
piece-parts, unserviceable end items, and AWP assets. (Note: NWRM assets are excluded.)

20.11.2.15.11. (Added) AWP Metrics. DLA will provide AWP by Resource Control Center
(RCC), NSN and Source of Supply (SOS) to isolate problem components, poor support to repair
shops, and SOS support. The information will be used to assist in solving wholesale and retail
242                                            AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012


stockage and issue problems.

20.12. (Added) Multiple Source of Repair (MSOR). MSOR items use a combination of
organic and/or contract repair such as organic/organic, organic/contract, or contract/contract.
The items are routed to the appropriate organic and/or contract repair sites.

20.13. (Added) Supportability. Supportability is measured in terms of carcass, capacity, funds
and parts. Each of these resources affects a shop’s ability to perform the repair. For example,
lack of carcasses, parts, capacity, and funds will prevent the end item from being driven into the
shop. All of these resources are evaluated each day as part of the repair process before any
repairs are funded. The vehicle to evaluate resource supportability is the Supportability Module
in EXPRESS.

20.13.1. (Added) EXPRESS (See AFMCI 23-120, Execution And Prioritization Repair
Support System (EXPRESS)). EXPRESS measures carcass, capacity, funds and parts against
predetermined criteria. In EXPRESS, AFGLSC has the ability to adjust carcass criteria. They
also have the responsibility to see if carcasses can be made available where the EXPRESS
Supportability Module considers repair to be constrained based on carcasses not being available.
Two EXPRESS outputs that reveal when carcass constraints are evident are the Supportability
Report and the Supportability Summary.

20.13.2. (Added) Organic Repair. EXPRESS will identify repairs for programmed workload.
Programmed workload is defined as workload assigned a permanent control number.

20.13.3. (Added) Non-Programmed Workload Support. The non-programmed workloads may
include: Insurance/Numerical Stockage Objective (INS/NSO) items, low demand items, local
manufacture, items that are not Cooperative Logistics Supply Support Agreement (non-CLSSA)
Foreign Military Sales (FMS) items, MODs/TCTO items, some Depot Maintenance Inter-service
Agreement (DMISA) items, and other non-predictable workloads. These requirements will be
worked using an AFMC Form 206.

20.14. (Added) Requirements. This process computes individual item requirements in D200. A
D200A Item Recomputation is initiated (as necessary) to make corrections after the final
computation has been printed. These corrections are passed to the Automated Budget
Compilation System (ABCS) D075 and D035E, Readiness Based Leveling (RBL). AFGLSC
will continue to validate forecasted repair/buy quantities and perform file maintenance. These
actions are required for long range planning and budgeting of buy and repair requirements. Base
and depot levels are computed when pipeline data is passed from D200 to RBL. Depot working
levels are overlaid into EXPRESS by RBL.

20.14.1. (Added) Readiness Based Leveling (RBL) D035E. RBL is the AF system designed to
allocate the D200A worldwide requirement among bases and the depot to reduce base expected
backorders. RBL ensures the worldwide sum of levels does not exceed the requirement
computed in D200A. RBL allocates all Adjusted Stock Levels (ASLs) unless there is an
insufficient worldwide requirement to meet demands.
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012                                               243



20.14.2. (Added) Exchangeable Induction Policy: The CSAG-MD is self-sustaining wherein all
costs are required to be recouped through payments from our customers. DM should not usurp
AFGLSC responsibility for determining how to satisfy repair requirements by over inducting
carcasses as a source of supply for repair parts not available through normal channels of supply.
AFGLSC must retain the authority for initiating buys, paying DM to “harvest” usable repair
parts off carcasses held in supply, or use of any other means available to provide repair parts to
the repairing agency.

20.15. (Added) Reparable Asset Process.

20.15.1. (Added) This is the process of unserviceable assets transferring from the customer to
the repair facility. Upon successful funds application within daily EXPRESS process and receipt
of D7, the unserviceable asset is moved directly from central receiving to the repair facility when
a repair requirement exists in EXPRESS. If no immediate requirement exists, the unserviceable
asset is stored in the warehouse pending future repair, reclamation, or disposal.

20.15.2. (Added) The EXPRESS logic determines which programmed demands to repair first
and if an asset will be inducted that day. EXPRESS uses multiple systems to obtain item specific
data that includes the Daily Demand Rates and specific EXPRESS MAJCOM Scenario
Subsystem (EMSS) data. EXPRESS will generate a complete list of all programmed repair
actions on a daily basis for organic items. Non-programmed workload requirements will be
handled on an exception basis.

20.15.3. (Added) Supportability Module. EXPRESS automatically determines which items can
be repaired by using the supportability module. Funding shortfalls are identified and AFGLSC
will coordinate with the Product Directorate Funds Manager for resolution. High priority
supportability failures should receive special management emphasis within the CSAG-S.

20.15.4. (Added) Automated Funding (J025A). After intervention, the scrubbed supportable list
is passed to J025A for funding. If it passes funding, the list is passed back to EXPRESS. If
there is a failure at the funding point, AFGLSC may be tasked to do further research.

20.15.5. (Added) D035K EXPRESS Table Loading. EXPRESS passes the funded supportable
prioritized list to the D035K EXPRESS Table. Loading the list to the D035K EXPRESS Table
starts movement of unserviceable assets into the applicable maintenance facility for repair.

20.16. (Added) EXPRESS Contingency Planning. In the event that the daily prioritization,
funding, and distribution automated processes fail, there are various options available based on
the circumstances causing the contingency.


20.16.1. (Added) Typically, if all data required for optimal EXPRESS processing is not

available, ALCs should proceed with EXPRESS processing using the data available. Except in
244                                            AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012


the event that D035B data is not available, there are two options to consider.


20.16.1.1. (Added) If work in progress, plus workload from the previous Prioritized List limited
by available repair resources adequately occupies the shop, no new EXPRESS run is necessary
(i.e., it is better to work with the previous data than to use outputs produced by EXPRESS
without the D035B file). Of course, the repair constraints must be considered manually in this
case as the EXPRESS Supportability function will not be applicable.

20.16.1.2. (Added) Only if the unsupported repair objective plus work in progress is not
sufficient to workload the shop should the scheduler request the system administrator to proceed
with EXPRESS processing realizing the results will be somewhat compromised by the lack of
current D035B data. Since the system administrator may be requested to proceed with
EXPRESS processing, which will overlay the previous results, any scheduler planning to use the
previous results needs to make a copy of the Prioritized List.

20.16.2. (Added) If EXPRESS fails to run, continue to repair assets where the previous day’s
repair left off (i.e., where the total repair objective was not supported, due to limited repair
resources). The previous day’s unsupported repair objective is visible on the EXPRESS
Prioritized List. If the previous day’s unsupported repair objective plus work in progress is not
sufficient to workload the shop, the ‘bringing in of additional workload’ will be a managerial
decision.

20.17. (Added) Manual Intervention of the EXPRESS Table. There may be times when it is
necessary for the Scheduler to manually intervene with the automated process of developing the
daily EXPRESS Table. This can be done in the EXPRESS Table Quantities Output in
EXPRESS immediately following the Supportability Module run. All intervention transactions
must take place as designated by the ALC EXPRESS office. Changes will not be accepted after
this time. All file maintenance changes to EXPRESS data during intervention should be made
with caution. The intervention window is the opportunity for AFGLSC to review and/or input
recommended changes to the Scheduler for manual intervention. CAUTION: Incorrect input(s)
will result in serious operational problems, data problems, funding problems, and possible
erroneous repair drives. Any intervention for quantity or switch changes must be fully
documented with descriptive reason statement, date, and name/title of person making change.

20.17.1. (Added) During intervention, there are no specific restrictions regarding deletion of
stock numbers or quantities for which the Scheduler is responsible. However, barring only the
exceptions specified below, the Scheduler is permitted to add only stock numbers or quantities
that are identified on that day’s EXPRESS Supportability Report.

20.17.2. (Added) The report reflects items that are both supportable and unsupportable. The
added stock numbers or quantities must be limited to those which are prioritized above the
lowest priority requirement supported by the funding burn rate. Moreover, stock numbers or
adequate quantities shown as supportable must be selected and deleted from the EXPRESS Table
to offset the repair costs of any stock numbers or quantities that are added.
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012                                               245


20.17.3. (Added) Conditions Required for Manual Intervention. The Scheduler may only
manually intervene in the automated process if one or more of the following circumstances exist:

20.17.3.1. (Added) Interchangeable and Substitution (I&S) Issues. Examples include Subgroup
Master NSN versus Actual NSN, one-way interchangeable items, and Authorized for
Procurement Purposes (APP) NSNs. To address these in intervention, a new NSN can be added
but only when it is offset by deleting the identified NSN for which it substitutes.

20.17.3.2. (Added) Equipment constraints. EXPRESS does not consider the type or amount of
equipment in the shop. The Supportability Module only calculates the number of hours available
in a shop. The Scheduler must review the daily EXPRESS repair listing to ensure the capacity of
the shop’s equipment has not been exceeded for the items being driven into repair.

20.17.3.3. (Added) Personnel constraints. EXPRESS does not consider the skills available in the
shop. When the repair listing cannot be supported due to personnel constraints, the Scheduler
may correct the listing to accurately reflect the skills and/or number of personnel available.

20.17.3.4. (Added) Erroneous parts data. When an NSN fails for parts and research shows those
parts are available, the end item shall be brought in for repair unless another constraint exists.
Also, when an NSN is identified for repair and parts are not available, the end item may be
removed from the repair list.

20.17.3.5. (Added) Validated data discrepancies. When data discrepancies can be validated, the
problem must be documented and reported to the appropriate OPR. When this “dirty data” can
be accurately validated, the OPR, typically AFGLSC, must determine what the repair
requirement and priority would be for an affected item if the data were valid. If the Scheduler is
convinced the NSN should be added to or the quantity increased on the EXPRESS Table, it can
be done provided an NSN and/or adequate quantity of lower priority supportable requirements
are deleted to offset the repair cost of the added requirements. Conversely, a data discrepancy
resulting in a decision to reduce repair requirements or priorities can be addressed by deleting the
affected NSN or reducing the quantity during intervention.

20.18. (Added) Supportability Max Item Switch and Quantity (“M” switch). The Scheduler
is responsible for setting the Max Item Switch and Max Item Quantity. These settings are used
together to manage capacity in the shop by controlling the maximum number of items allowed
on the EXPRESS Table. The settings are by specific NSN. CAUTION: Incorrect input(s) may
result in erroneous repair drives.

20.18.1 (Added) Supportability Max Item Switch. This is a three-position switch that
determines which particular assets (Condition Code "Y", Awaiting Maintenance (AWM), OWO)
will be included in the Supportability Max Shop Quantity calculation on this screen and in the
Supportability Max Item Quantity calculation on the “Item” view. The selection of “EXPRESS
Table,” “AWM Pipe,” or “Repair Pipe” in the Repair Resource View determines how shop
quantity will be capped. Default value is “EXPRESS Table“.

20.18.2. (Added) EXPRESS Table. Constrains the number of potential, repairable, supportable
246                                            AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012


requirements that are loaded to the EXPRESS Table to the quantity placed in the Supportability
Max Shop Quantity field for that shop.

20.18.3. (Added) AWM Pipe. Constrains the number of potential, repairable, supportable
requirements that are loaded to the EXPRESS Table to the Supportability Max Shop Quantity
field less the sum of all items that have Condition Code "Y" or are AWM for that shop.

20.18.4. (Added) Repair Pipe. Constrains the number of potential, repairable, supportable
requirements that are loaded to the EXPRESS Table to the Supportability Max Shop Quantity
field less the sum of all items that have Condition Code "Y" or are AWM or OWO for that shop.

20.18.5. (Added) Supportability Max Item Quantity. This data field represents maximum items
allowed in the shop for the specific item. It depends upon switch setting of “Supportability Max
Item Switch” in Repair Resource View. Default value is 99999 (100% unconstrained quantity).
The field range is from 0 to 99999.

20.18.5.1. (Added) AFGLSC Recommendations. AFGLSC can recommend changes to the Max
Item settings but the Scheduler has the final authority and is ultimately responsible for induction
into maintenance.

20.18.6. (Added) Conditions Required for Max Item Switch and Quantity. The Scheduler may
only set the Max Item Switch and Quantity if one or more of the circumstances in 20.17.3
(Conditions Required for Manual Intervention) exist.

20.18.6.1. (Added) The Max Item switch and quantity should be used as a last resort to manage
capacity in a shop. It is intended to be used short term and not as a continuous filter for
requirements.

20.18.7. (Added) Max Item switches and quantities will be reported in the Exchangeable
meeting. Corrective action should be taken to help resolve the circumstances behind the use the
Max Item switches and quantities. The Scheduler is then responsible to remove the Max Item
switch and quantity.

20.18.8. (Added) The exception to use Max Item switch and quantity on a continuous basis is
the “AWM Pipe” or “Repair Pipe”. CAUTION: Incorrect input(s) may result in erroneous
repair drives. The “AWM Pipe” or “Repair Pipe” settings may be used to maintain a constant
level of repairs for a specific NSN in a shop. This logic helps to maximize shop efficiency by
maintaining a standard OWO balance throughout the shop. The Production Controller will
ensure all repair requirements continue to be met when utilizing the “AWM Pipe” and “Repair
Pipe” settings. Any repair requirement shortfalls should be discussed in the Exchangeable
meeting.

20.19. (Added) Exchangeable Meeting.

20.19.1. (Added) Purpose. The Exchangeable meeting is used to ensure the depot repair process
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                26 APRIL 2012                                              247


is on track, seek methods of improvement, and apply the necessary resources to get the job done.
It provides the necessary oversight and direction to engage all key players. The meeting
enhances communication and ensures that all team members are given the opportunity to
identify/solve problems that hinder maintenance in repairing assets. Topics discussed vary based
on local conditions but include the mandatory areas specified in this instruction. Roles and
responsibilities of Exchangeable meeting key players are outlined below.

20.19.2. (Added) Formal Exchangeables Meetings. Formal Exchangeable meetings will be held
monthly. The Group Commander/Director will chair the meeting to facilitate cross flow of
problems, solutions, and innovations. The purpose of the formal meeting is to inform the Group
Commander/Director of issues impacting the repair cycle that delay or prevent adequate
customer support and facilitate communication between functional groups to resolve these
issues. The number of formal monthly meetings may vary depending on the number of
Squadrons within the Production Group. The Exchangeable meeting focus is found in Table
20.1. The Group Commander/Director is responsible for publication of the formal monthly
minutes. Constraints that cannot be resolved at the formal monthly meeting shall be elevated to
the MXW for resolution.

20.19.3. (Added) The Squadron Chief will chair the informal Exchangeable meeting. No
formal minutes are required. Constraints that cannot be resolved at the informal Exchangeable
meeting will be addressed at the formal monthly Exchangeable meeting with the Group
Commander/Director. Exchangeable meeting focus is found in Table 20.1.

Table 20.1. (Added) Exchangeable Meeting Focus.



 What to Review                                  Questions to Ask. Examples listed below
 Asset Posture                                   What is on-hand at field level?
                                                 Is the Redistribution Order (RDO) an option?
                                                 What is the serviceable balance?
                                                 Do we have available “F” condition
                                                 carcasses?
                                                 How many items are backordered?
 Repair Cycle (Snapshot View)                    What’s Broken?
                                                 Where is it?
                                                 Is somebody fixing it?
                                                 What are the bottlenecks?
                                                 What are the leading indicators?
 Repair Cycle Dynamics                           How fast?
                                                 How reliable?
                                                 Right priorities?
                                                 Resource problems?
                                                 People problems?
                                                 Contractor support?
248                                            AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012



20.19.4. (Added) Exchangeable Meeting Attendees. The mandatory monthly forum will include
all people who resolve problems within the depot repair process. The Squadron
Commander/Director, AFGLSC personnel, appropriate representatives from Engineering,
Contracting Procurement, DLA, and others critical to customer support will participate in these
meetings if specific issues demand their attendance. Personnel at other ALCs will FAX or email
the status of items for which they are responsible to the affected Squadron Commander/Director.
If issues exist, these individuals will participate in the meetings via video-teleconference,
speakerphone, etc. The Squadron Commander/Director responsible for the problem item will
lead the discussion.

20.19.5. (Added) Roles and Responsibilities in support of the Exchangeable meetings.

20.19.5.1. (Added) The AFGLSC role is to brief the worldwide health of the item. This
includes information on the Exchangeable Chart as required. This includes the Asset Posture
items listed in Table 20.1. AFGLSC is responsible for attending the Exchangeable meetings if
items being reviewed are under their area of responsibility. AFGLSC is also responsible for any
additional information relative to the problem item that is not portrayed on the chart or that
requires further explanation. This may involve identifying and correcting data problems
involving requirements and asset data that impact EXPRESS. AFGLSC should also be prepared
to discuss any procurement issues, availability of carcasses for reclamation or cannibalization,
status of repair actions at contractor or other organic locations, etc.

20.19.5.2. (Added) DLA will brief parts-related issues and AWP status.

20.19.5.3. (Added) The Contracting Officer will attend, as necessary, to discuss contracting
issues.

20.19.6. (Added) Exchangeable Meeting Discussions. The Squadron Director will lead
Exchangeable meeting discussions. The entire team will participate as necessary in the
discussion directing efforts at problem resolution. The basic health and status of items will be
addressed covering the specifics of what failed and why.

20.19.6.1. (Added) The Top 10 problem items to be briefed will be determined using the
EXPRESS Supportability Summary Report. The review will consist of the items in accordance
with the Single Prioritization Across Weapon Systems (SPAWS) ranking that have failed.
Additional items that cannot be produced may be added to the list.

20.19.6.2. (Added) Workaround for Determining the Top 10. Currently, there is no automated
method to have the Supportability Summary Report sort items for multiple shops. An alternate
method would be to run the Supportability Summary Report for the entire ALC, eliminate those
shops not within the Group Commander/Director purview, and select the Top 10 items in
accordance with the SPAWS ranking that have failed.

20.19.6.3. (Added) AFGLSC Recommendations. AFGLSC can recommend an item is included
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012                                              249


on the list to be presented but the Squadron Commander/Director has the final authority to
determine what is presented.

20.19.6.4. (Added) AWP and Hangar Queens. In addition to the Top 10 items, the meeting will
also include a status of parts driving AWPs and all Hangar Queens compiled by DLA.
Additional back-up charts should be added as required.

20.19.6.5. (Added) Exchangeable Chart Data (Information may be obtained from Supply
Management Analysis Reporting Tool (SMART) or other current command systems).

20.19.6.5.1. (Added) WorldWide (WW) Active Inventory. This is the amount of inventory
needed to support all customers (i.e., FMS, other services, and non-capitalized customers). This
includes authorized and on-hand levels. Formulas and information sources are:

20.19.6.5.2. (Added) Authorized (WW Inv Auth). WW Inv Auth = MICAPs + POS Authorized
+ RSP Authorized + WL Authorized + CRI Estimate.

20.19.6.5.3. (Added) On-hand (WW Inv OH). WW Inv OH = POS On-Hand + RSP On-hand +
Work-In-Process + CSI On-hand + CRI On-hand + In-transit (serviceable and unserviceable).

20.19.6.5.4. (Added) WorldWide MICAPs (MICAP).

20.19.6.5.5. (Added) SPAWS Value. SPAWS is the prioritization method within EXPRESS
that merges each of the weapon system priority lists into a single prioritized list across all
weapon systems (indicated by rank and support indicator). The Fixer uses this list to make repair
induction decisions for a specific NSN to support field-level requirements.

20.19.6.5.6. (Added) Peacetime Operating Stock (POS).

20.19.6.5.7. (Added) Authorized (POS Auth). This is the computed RBL level within Standard
Base Supply System (SBSS) or D035K.

20.19.6.5.8. (Added) On-hand (POS OH).

20.19.6.5.9. (Added) Readiness Spares Packages (RSP).

20.19.6.5.10. (Added) Authorized (RSP Auth).

20.19.6.5.11. (Added) On-hand (RSP OH).

20.19.6.5.12. (Added) Net Repair Objective (Net Rep Obj). The repair objective quantity
provided by EXPRESS. This quantity is calculated before the supportability module has
processed. This figure is obtained from the Working Level and Base Needs report in EXPRESS.

20.19.6.5.13. (Added) Working Level Authorized (WL Auth). Computed by RBL and is the
250                                           AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012


recommended amount of assets that should be in the Consolidated Serviceable Inventory (CSI)
and Work-In-Process (WIP) at any one time to support requirements. These assets are owned by
AFGLSC and are located at a depot, contractor facility, or at an off-base storage location. The
level can be obtained from the Working Level and Base Needs report in EXPRESS.

20.19.6.5.14. (Added) Consolidated Reparable Inventory Estimated (CRI Est). The amount of
unserviceable assets that RBL estimates should be in the retrograde pipeline or available in the
warehouse. This information is found in the depot working level file in D035E to EXPRESS.

20.19.6.5.15. (Added) Total Work-In-Process (Total WIP). Shows the status of assets currently
in the repair process. Includes any assets in work at another repair location such as a contractor,
another service, or another depot. For depot assets, this quantity includes OWO, AWM, and
unserviceable materiel in transit to maintenance. While D035K at each depot has visibility of the
local WIP balances, only D035A has visibility of assets in WIP at off-base storage locations and
at each depot. Total of the following balances: WIP assets (condition code M) at the depots, O/P
code 09; WIP assets (condition code M) at repair contractors or other services, O/P code A; and
unserviceable assets in transit to maintenance (condition code Y), O/P code 09.

20.19.6.5.16. (Added) Consolidated Serviceable Inventory On-Hand (CSI OH). The total of the
following balances provided by D035A: Serviceable assets (condition code A and Z), O/P code
09 stored at a depot, (Condition code B and C assets are rolled up in the “A” quantity,);
serviceable assets (condition code A) stored at off-base storage locations, O/P A; and serviceable
assets (condition code A) stored at repair contractor locations, O/P code A.

20.19.6.5.17. (Added) Consolidated Reparable Inventory On-Hand (CRI OH). Total of the
following quantities are obtained from D035A: Unserviceable materiel (condition code D, E, F,
G, J, K, L, Q, and R) at a depot, O/P 09; unserviceable materiel (condition code D, E, F, G, J, K,
L, Q, and R) at an off base storage location (includes contractor and other service storage
locations), O/P A.

20.19.6.5.18. (Added) Unserviceable In-transit (In-transit). Amount of unserviceable materiel
being returned from retail customers. Provided by D035C (HDFA screen): Unserviceable In-
transit are O/P 01 and HK (INTRANSIT UNS).

20.19.6.5.19. (Added) Monthly Demand Rate (MDR). Production is concerned with the SCM
wholesale repair requirement versus the retail demand rate generated by CSAG-S retail
customers.

20.19.6.5.20. (Added) Retention Authorized (Retention Auth). The maximum amount of assets
AFGLSC is authorized to have in their inventory.

20.19.6.5.21. (Added) Local Work-In-Process (Local WIP). The amount of assets in the repair
process at the local ALC. This balance is obtained from D035A as condition code M, O/P 09.

20.19.6.5.22. (Added) Additional information. The following information should be considered
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012                                                251


when building the Exchangeable production chart.

20.19.6.5.22.1. (Added) Procurement Due-Ins. Information concerning procurement due-ins is
not reflected on this chart because this chart displays the “current” health of the item not “future”
health. AFGLSC should be prepared to discuss any procurement issues or pending buys.

20.19.6.5.23. (Added) Exchangeable Production Chart Overall Item Rating. Maintenance will
color-code the overall rating of the item green, yellow, or red as follows: Green means item has
no MICAPs and all individual ratings are green. Yellow means the item has no MICAPs and one
or more of the individual items are yellow. Red means the item has one or more MICAPs and/or
one or more of the individual items are red. See Fig. 20.3. Sample Exchangeable Production
Meeting Chart.

20.19.6.5.23.1. (Added) Overall Equipment Rating. Maintenance independently rates each
critical piece of equipment. Green indicates adequate equipment to handle the projected
workload is available and is in serviceable condition. Yellow indicates adequate equipment is
not available but an acceptable plan is in place (i.e. equipment is down for routine maintenance,
needs minor repair, or scheduled for routine maintenance and a workaround exists). Red
indicates that adequate equipment is not available or equipment is down for maintenance for an
extended period of time and no workaround exists. Individual equipment ratings will be rolled
up to a composite equipment color-code rating. Items with any critical equipment having a
color-coded rating of red or yellow will have the same overall equipment rating.

20.19.6.5.23.2. (Added) Overall Personnel Rating. Maintenance rates personnel. Green
indicates that sufficient personnel are available to produce full requirements. Yellow indicates
personnel are available to produce critical areas of MICAP and RSP but some requirements
(POS and/or CSI) cannot be filled. Yellow also indicates requirements can be met but overtime
rate exceeds sustainable levels. Red indicates sufficient personnel are not available to fulfill
requirements for MICAP or RSP items or when capacity is used up for further repairs. Personnel
status will remain red until additional hours are assigned or become available through completed
repairs.

20.19.6.5.23.3. (Added) Overall Flow Day Rating. Maintenance rates flow days. Green
indicates the item is produced in less than or equal to the standard flow days. Red is assigned to
items produced with flow days greater than the standard. Standard Shop Flow Days will be
calculated and reviewed in accordance with AFMCI 21-105, Depot Maintenance Work
Measurement. The Standard Shop Flow Days are input into G019C. Actual Shop Flow Days
will be obtained from the appropriate maintenance system.

20.19.6.5.23.4. (Added) Overall Consolidated Repairable Inventory Rating. AFGLSC validates
CRI inventory. Green is assigned if carcasses are on hand. Green is also assigned if RBL
identified CRI levels of zero. Red is assigned when carcasses are not available.

20.19.6.5.23.5. (Added) Overall Parts Rating. Maintenance rates overall components. Green is
assigned to items with parts on hand to do the EXPRESS driven repairs. Red is assigned if parts
are on backorder and not available to support RDD. The D035K system is used for access to
252                                            AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012


estimated delivery dates.

20.19.6.5.23.6. (Added) Overall Funds Rating. Green indicates funding is available and
production is not impacted. Yellow indicates funds are available to cover the critical areas of
MICAP and Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) projects but funding lacks capability to cover full
requirements. Red is assigned when lack of funding is preventing the MICAP or JCS item from
being brought into repair.

20.20. (Added) Job Routing.

20.20.1. (Added) The decision to Job Route/Non Job Route will be made by the SPO/SPM or
AFGLSC, as appropriate, working with the MXW and DLA. Normal practice is for an
unserviceable asset to be turned into supply in exchange for an available serviceable asset.
Consequently, job routed repair is not authorized if a serviceable asset is available from supply in
the configuration required. All conversions from job-routed to non-job routed should begin
budget lead-time away for anticipated cost changes to the CSAG-MD/CSAG-S. If
circumstances still require job routing, approval must be obtained from the Program Office.
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012                                              253


Such action must be reported to supply in order for supply to record accurately the true
requirements for stockage. (See AFMC Supplement to AFI 20-110 for NWRM job routing
guidance.)

20.20.2. (Added) Job Routed Repair. Job routed repair occurs when a recoverable component is
found to be unserviceable during the overhaul, the item is removed, repaired/reconditioned, and
reinstalled on the same end item.

20.20.3. (Added) Non Job Routed Repair. Non job routed repair occurs when an unserviceable
item is removed and replaced with a serviceable item from supply. A non-routing process is a
strictly remove and replace operation.

20.21. (Added) Procedures for Job Routing (As approved by the SPO/SPM or AFGLSC, as
appropriate).

20.21.1. (Added) The appropriate WCDs will be developed and used as required by Chapter 19.
All job-routed repairs are to be input and tracked though the repair process via the appropriate
data system.

20.22. (Added) Procedures for Non-job Routing.

20.22.1. (Added) Shop replaceable units (SRUs) removed from line replaceable units should be
turned into DLA and a serviceable asset used to fill the hole on the end item. Due in from
maintenance/due-out to maintenance (DIFM/DOTM) procedures will be used to maintain
financial/material accountability. If the SPO/SPM or AFGLSC (whoever manages the item)
approves, job-routing will be permitted if SRUs are not available.

20.23. (Added) Process Routing.

20.23.1. (Added) Process routing which consists of forwarding an item to a process shop is an
integral part of the overall repair effort but isn’t considered a job route. A process shop is
defined as a DM function that provides conditioning support on component assemblies and
materials, or essential support services for end items being repaired by other DM organizations.
The following are examples of candidates for process routing: cleaning, plating, heat treat,
welding, battery servicing, grinding, machining, non-destructive inspections (NDIs), check/test,
and minor maintenance (Not to Exceed Level Three Field Repairs).

20.24. (Added) Materiel Management.

20.24.1. (Added) Wholesale Requisition Process. Customer initiated requisitions are received
into D035A, the system checks asset availability, and either releases or backorders the
requisition. (Reference document AFMAN 23-110, Vol. 3, Part 3.)

20.24.2. (Added) Requisitions. Requisitions, both programmed and non-programmed, originate
from several sources through their respective data systems. They are as follows:
254                                            AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012


20.24.2.1. (Added) Base level Requisitions. Base level customers (operational commands)
submit requisitions through SBSS (D002A).

20.24.2.2. (Added) Depot level Requisitions. Depot level customers submit orders into
ABOM/NIMMS which passes to D035K and creates a backorder for requisition action.
Requisition passes to the appropriate SOS.

20.24.2.3. (Added) FMS/Other Service Requisitions. FMS and other Service customers submit
requisitions through their respective host system.

20.24.2.4. (Added) Contractor Requisitions. Contractor customers submit requisitions through
the Commercial Asset Visibility Air Force (CAVAF) system.

20.24.3. (Added) Organic Repair Asset Visibility. AFGLSC will monitor D035A to ensure that
backorders are being pre-positioned and released correctly. D035A provides asset information
on assets going into and out of maintenance and assets in work.

20.24.4. (Added) Contract Repair Asset Visibility. The CAVAF system passes asset records to
D035A through the D375 interface for a contractor location by condition code.

20.24.5. (Added) Asset Balances. The CAVAF system provides asset balances on contractor
assets.

20.24.6. (Added) RBL Depot Level. The RBL Depot Level is made up of the retrograde
pipeline and the working level. The retrograde pipeline addresses the time expected for an asset
to be returned from base supply. The working level can be broken into two parts, the repair
pipeline and safety level. The repair pipeline addresses the time expected to repair an item.

20.24.7. (Added) Automated Release of Backorders. EXPRESS determines the prioritization
logic for release of backorders based on multiple factors including flying hours, bases levels vs.
assets, etc.

20.25. (Added) EXPRESS Funds Application.

20.25.1. (Added) Purpose. This guidance provides direction for funds application of Work
Authority (WA) as it relates to EXPRESS funding execution.

20.25.2. (Added) There is no ownership of the repair work authority as AFGLSC WA is held in
central pool by specific SOS. The central pool is maintained and executed at Group level to
allow for funding on demand to support the repair on demand process. This process focuses on
the reparable assets managed by the AFGLSC 448 SCMW. These items can be identified by a
three position Expendability Repairability Recoverability Code designator of XD1 or XD2 or the
one position alpha designator of C or T. Items are also identified as budget code “8” items.

20.25.3. (Added) The AFGLSC Group FM office for each SOS is responsible for providing
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                26 APRIL 2012                                            255


timely funding to allow daily EXPRESS execution via J025A, Automated Project Order System
Project Order (PO).

20.25.4. (Added) The AFGLSC Group Wholesale Funds Manager(s) representative from the
SOS Group FM office will address funding issues at Exchangeable meetings for their SOS.
They will communicate with AFGLSC 448 SCMW/FM prior to the meetings to obtain the latest
funding information.

20.26. (Added) Organic Workload Funding Execution Process.

20.26.1. (Added) The EXPRESS system determines the repair execution requirements for
organic programmed repair items (Exchangeables) and identifies them by Sub Group Master
(SGM) and by weighted repair cost. On a daily basis EXPRESS triggers the PO funding process
in J025A. For each Source of Supply (SOS)/Source of Repair (SOR) combination, J025A
generates an on-line PO using data from EXPRESS and the G004L, Job Order Production
Master System. J025A then notifies EXPRESS when the PO has been funded and accepted or
that funding was not completed. CSAG-MD will not put assets into work without a funded PO.

20.26.2. (Added) EXPRESS burn rates.

20.26.2.1. (Added) The EXPRESS supportability module for each SOR contains a separate burn
rate for each SOS having repair at that SOR. The burn rates tell EXPRESS supportability
module how much WA is available from each SOS to support their daily repair requirements.
The EXPRESS burn rate is SOS specific rather than shop specific. The AFGLSC Group
Wholesale Funds Manager(s) is responsible for the SOS repair funding burn rate data and to
ensure burn rate data has been properly entered into EXPRESS. The burn rate data consists of
four elements that are required to calculate the EXPRESS burn rate: SOS Checkbook, Days
Remaining, Funding K-factor (%), and Percent of Checkbook. These values can be changed as
needed.

20.26.2.2. (Added) SOS Checkbook is the uncommitted WA balance for a particular SOS.
EXPRESS Depot Funding will receive each SOS’s uncommitted WA balance for MPC 1Q01
from J025A daily.

20.26.2.3. (Added) Days Remaining identifies the remaining workdays in FY or for a specific
number of days the applicable funding should apply. The AFGLSC Group Wholesale Funds
Manager(s) work(s) with the CSAG-MD Acceptor at each SOR to identify the remaining
workdays.

20.26.2.4. (Added) Percent of Checkbook is the percent of uncommitted WA balance that will
be applied for an SOS’s requirements at a particular SOR.

20.26.2.5. (Added) Funding K-factor (%) allows the daily burn rate to be exceeded by a
predetermined percent. If SOS burn rate is calculated to $500 for a given day, and the SOS
selected 150% for the K factor, the burn rate will equal $750. The EXPRESS supportability
module would use $750 as the burn rate for this SOS rather than $500. The K-factor helps with
256                                           AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012


situations where an item has an extremely high unit repair cost or the requirement on a given day
exceeds the burn rate because of increased demands.

20.26.3. (Added) Burn rate calculation.

20.26.3.1. (Added) EXPRESS calculates the SOS burn rates by multiplying the SOS’s
uncommitted WA balance by the SOS’s percent assigned to that SOR then divides by remaining
work days and multiplies this value by the K-factor %. SOS burn rate = K factor x
[(uncommitted WA x % of WA)/ days remaining].

20.26.4. (Added) EXPRESS PO Processing.

20.26.4.1. (Added) J025A edits the information it receives from the EXPRESS file. Using the
EXPRESS data and information from G004L, J025A will automatically build/initiate a PO and
transmit to the Initiator/Approver (AFGLSC Group Wholesale Funds Manager) at appropriate
SOS. J025A cannot attempt to build a PO for the requirement if data is missing or has invalid
characters for: the Production Control Number, SGM, Quantity, Production Section Scheduling
Designator (PSSD) and Fund Classification Reference Number (FCRN). Care must be taken to
ensure this data is properly entered in EXPRESS/G004L.

20.26.4.2. (Added) The Initiator/Approver ensures funding is available and the proper funds for
requirement are being utilized. Initiator/Approver initiates and/or approves PO on-line in J025A.
Approver then transmits the PO on-line to the CSAG-MD Acceptor. Once Acceptor signs PO,
notification is returned to EXPRESS stating funds application is complete. Record of the PO is
also forwarded to DIFMS/FIT to update the maintenance financial records.

20.26.4.3. (Added) Prior to acceptance, if the Acceptor rejects the PO, it is passed back to the
Approver and back to the Initiator with comments for appropriate action(s). Subject to required
actions, funding will not be applied for induction needs for the particular funding stream
(Program Control Number/FCRN) in question that day.

20.26.5. (Added) PO acceptance.

20.26.5.1. (Added) There is no partial approval/acceptance of a PO. After supportability and
subject to maintenance manual intervention, should total dollar value on PO exceed total
available WA, the Initiator will reduce the requirement to the available funding. Initiator can
delete any or all funding streams from the PO.

20.26.5.2. (Added) The CSAG-MD Acceptor’s on-line signature on the PO indicates CSAG-
MD is accepting SOS’s offer (the workload). This process allows the CSAG-MD to incur an
expense on behalf of the AFGLSC.

20.26.6. (Added) PO Funds Application Time Limits.

20.26.6.1. (Added) There is a two hour window (1330-1530 Eastern Time) to build the PO,
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012                                               257


approve the funds, accept the PO, and notify EXPRESS of the funded or unfunded requirements.

20.26.6.2. (Added) The Initiator is responsible for oversight of the acceptance process. Initiator
is required to monitor the EXPRESS funding process and contact the Acceptor when the PO
amendments are not being processed in a timely manner. They will ensure the approval,
certification, and acceptance process is completed during the two hour window. If completion
cannot be accomplished, the Initiator/Approver/Certifier/Acceptor in J025A may request to
extend open the J025A EXPRESS window.

20.26.6.3. (Added) Upon completion of funding process, EXPRESS reformats the funded
J025A file and sends to D035K which begins the movement of reparable carcasses to shops for
induction and repair to commence.

20.26.7. (Added) Contingency Plan.

20.26.7.1. (Added) If J025A is down, the CSAG-MD Acceptor will sign paper copy and return
to the initiator. The Initiator will hold the paper copy until J025A comes back on-line.

20.26.7.2. (Added) J025A provides a PO amendment number that G004L needs to load the
information into the maintenance systems. Amendment numbers are not available until the
Initiator is able to input the POs into J025A.

20C-Production Support for Aircraft and Missile Repair

20.27. (Added) Purpose. This section outlines the DM production support philosophy and
policies required to effectively operate and manage the aircraft/missile repair process.

20.27.1. (Added) Aircraft/Missile management will implement an automated aircraft/missile
production operation-level schedule. This schedule must be available to both production and
support personnel. A tail/serial number-specific production schedule (with its critical path)
provides the focus for synchronizing logistics support and direct labor. The goal for all process
support players is to provide the supporting resources to the mechanic prior to the operation start
date. Aircraft/Missile management must not shift major jobs in the schedule for manipulating
short term efficiency of direct labor. Movement of operations within the Aircraft ten day
windows will remain the prerogative of the Tail Team (see paragraph 20.27.7). Adherence to
schedule will be more critical as flow days are reduced. Independent, uncoordinated
manipulation of the schedules would de-synchronize the in-work major aircraft/missile tasks
from their support logistics. Unexpected events will always occur and may require changes to
the schedule. Unexpected events are more readily accommodated when the majority of tasks are
accomplished according to schedule. The schedule emanates from production’s annual (fiscal
year) work plan with the number of aircraft/missiles by work package, becomes more specific by
MDS level of detail, and is most specific with the schedule by tail number for a particular aircraft
or serial number for a particular missile. This schedule resides in the aircraft/missile repair
scheduling system that captures operations by start date within the network and provides project
management capability and visibility to all.
258                                            AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                   26 APRIL 2012


20.27.2. (Added) Aircraft/Missile management will man-load to the schedule on multiple shifts
within existing constraints, if required. This will result in fewer aircraft/missiles in work at one
time but these major end-items will flow through the depot at higher velocities. Aircraft labor
and logistic support will be highly focused on fewer aircraft. By reducing the number of aircraft
on-station, thereby increasing the number available in the field, an increasing capacity arises at
the ALC.

20.27.3. (Added) The first line supervisor assigns work and supervises mechanics performing
tasks on the aircraft/missile. Specialized support personnel provide most of the mechanic’s
material and other support requirements.

20.27.4. (Added) The Pre-Production Section (PPS) performs strategic planning, master
scheduling, and analytical activities needed to ensure production requirements are fully
supportable prior to aircraft/missile induction. Activities include customer requirements
analysis, long- to short-range production planning (supportability reviews), master production
scheduling, capacity and material requirements planning, and contingency (what-if)
management.

20.27.5. (Added) The Production Support Section (PSS) is the mechanic’s one-stop support
providing most resources prior to need date for availability at the operation start and therefore
not distracting direct labor away from their aircraft repair tasks. As a result of increased support
to the mechanic by other sources, the requirement for the mechanic to leave the aircraft/missile
to obtain materials to perform tasking is reduced.

20.27.6. (Added) Proper synchronization of available back shop repair capacity (supporting off-
aircraft/missile repair items) to the aircraft/missile schedule is a necessary pre-condition to
reducing the number of aircraft/missile flow days. The backshops will integrate the
aircraft/missile schedule requirements into their scheduling activities. This means
aircraft/missile production must be able to prioritize their backshop requirements as per the
aircraft production schedule. These priorities must then be de-conflicted if multiple
aircraft/missile or exchangeables customers require the same backshop capacity at the same time.
The synchronization team consists of a Schedule execution representative (Sync Rep), usually a
Scheduler from the PSS along with Exchangeable back shop representative(s). The team is
responsible to resolve these conflicting priorities and expedite output to schedule. These
representatives will meet as required to work the “hot item” aircraft/missile priorities from an
ALC perspective when conflicting demands for backshop capacity exist. De-conflicting
competing customer requirements for backshop capacity can only be done if the Sync Rep works
closely with the backshops. Accordingly, the backshop Planners are able to work quickly and
collaboratively to properly load available backshop capacity. Priorities worked in the backshops
must be synchronized to the aircraft/missile schedule, if the integrity of the aircraft/missile
production schedule is to be maintained, and support provided when needed. Regular high-level
reviews occur to resolve conflicts between aircraft requirements and back shop capacity.

20.27.7. (Added) An automated program management scheduling system (e.g., PDMSS) is the
core system within the aircraft/missile repair process. Visibility of schedule, resources required
by operation start dates, operations by type required, funding, etc., are provided to the aircraft
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012                                               259


Tail Team/missile Product Focus Team (PFT) and process support personnel in the industrial
logistics pipeline so that all members synchronize their efforts to the aircraft/missile schedule.
The Scheduler, Production Support Technician (PST), and aircraft/missile First Line Supervisor
form the aircraft-specific tail support team and the missile specific PFT, which meets regularly to
assure support in “rolling ten day” windows. A Planner is available for support to the Tail
Team/PFT as needed. The scheduling system permits simulation of resources by type against the
schedule and has a report generation or query features for tailored reports.

20.27.8. (Added) The industrial support process, from requirement identification by the
SPO/SPM and MAJCOMs through completion of programmed, unprogrammed, modification,
and unpredictable depot level maintenance, is very complex. Each requirement has its own work
package consisting of tasks, required resources and schedule. To this end, planning and support
activities are highly integrated within the process. The process begins before aircraft/missile
arrival, continues during depot repair or modification, up through the departure for home station,
and additionally, for a period after actual departure (cost roll-ups, JON work completion/transfer,
JON closure, records closeouts, etc.). The activities include direct and indirect production
support, backshop support, system program or integrated weapon system management support,
supply support, production support, and FM support.

AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012                                                263



20.30.2.8. (Added) Coordinate delivery of kits/packages and available resources based upon
aircraft/missile schedule.

20.30.3. (Added) Synchronization Team Function: The Synchronization Team’s focus is on the
aircraft/missile tail/serial number schedule, the RDD of a given operation, and the backshops’
Estimated Delivery Date (EDD). The Synchronization Team has representatives from the
backshops and from each aircraft/missile squadron for backshop for conflict resolution. Specific
functions include:

20.30.3.1. (Added) Track and expedite manufacturing and repair work done in the backshops.

20.30.3.2. (Added) Track assets throughout the production cycle.

20.30.3.3. (Added) Coordinate with Scheduler upon failure of supportability to reschedule
operation.

20.31. (Added) Industrial Support to Aircraft and Missile Repair Processes.

20.31.1. (Added) Develop, Plan and Refine Requirements.

20.31.1.1. (Added) Aircraft and Missile Requirements (AMR). The AMR process is used to
develop, review, validate and approve depot level maintenance and repair for aircraft and missile
systems. Within the AMR Process is the Engineering Requirements Review Process (ERRP),
Bill of Work (BOW) Process, and the Requirements Supportability Process. These processes are
documented in the Logistics Requirements Determination Process (LRDP) Guide and Handbook
which can be located on the Centralized Asset Management (CAM) CoP:
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=23211

20.31.1.2. (Added) The ERRP drives the generation of a new engineering requirement from
conception through approval by providing justification with fully developed supportability
elements. In addition, it directs a review of existing scheduled maintenance tasks for validity.

20.31.1.3. (Added) The BOW documents all scheduled maintenance tasks contained in the
Work Spec and Brochure with the following elements: step-by-step work procedures, parts
listings, hazardous materials, special tooling, non-issued personal protective equipment (PPE),
support equipment, and production skills needed to perform the task. Additionally, it includes
the aircraft/missile maintenance network (critical path), conversion of the step-by-step work
procedures into operations to accomplish tasks, and updates to the list of materiels in their
respective data systems.

20.31.1.4. (Added) The Requirements Supportability Process reviews and assesses the
supportability for individual tasks (scheduled maintenance tasks) in the AMR Work Spec, AMR
Brochure, or Bill of Work. It determines the program year the task would be supportable and
added to the Work Spec and AMR Brochure.
264                                             AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                    26 APRIL 2012


20.31.1.5. (Added) Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM): PDM requirements identified by
the using command and system engineers are compiled as work specifications in a Work
Specification Document (Work Spec). Requirements may include programmed upgrades,
analytical condition inspections, and scheduled preventive maintenance. Aircraft/missile MDS,
and the age and condition of the aircraft are considered when determining PDM requirements.
The PDM requirements are presented to the SPO/SPM which compiles the requirements into a
Work Spec.

20.31.1.6. (Added) The SPO/SPM ES and Engineer will develop a LOM required for new work
by reviewing TOs, drawings, or other engineering data. The SPO/SPM ES will review the list of
“new” material (not previously loaded against a PDM or other depot task), to verify that all have
a NSN assigned. This includes NSNs for material, repair parts, special tools, hazardous
materials (HAZMAT), etc. When complete, this list will become the fully indentured
engineering BOM or MOD kit inventory consisting of component parts, quantity per unit, and
parent component relationships required to produce an end item. The SPO/SPM will send the
developed list to the AFGLSC, DLA and IPV. The AFGLSC, DLA and IPV, in turn, will
perform a preliminary supportability review and provide risk assessment to SPO/SPM.

20.31.1.7. (Added) The SPO/SPM will initiate the required action to assign NSNs to those items
required by the Work Spec that do not have an NSN assigned. Non-Stock Listed (NSL) items
identified later in the supportability process, either before or after the aircraft/missile has arrived
on-station and is in-work, can be referred back to the ES for necessary actions to stock list the
item.

20.31.1.8. (Added) The SPO/SPM will coordinate the development of the Work Spec with
maintenance. The validated Work Spec will be available 1 April by accessing Centralized
Access for Data Exchange (CAFDEx) or contacting the SPO/SPM. The Production Support
Flight will use the validated Work Spec to perform a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) (by
labor category) of work, to include any differences if the new Work Spec represents a change to
the current (already in-work) PDM package. The Planner will use the data provided in the Work
Spec, TO(s), and experience from first article to determine the labor hours, equipment, facilities,
material, and special tooling required to accomplish the SOW. The Planner will correlate the
specified work with required skill codes, identify which tasks have material associated, identify
facility requirements for each task, correlate required skills with hours, and flow the work in a
logical sequence.

20.31.1.9. (Added) The Collaborative Functional Team (see Chapter 13 of the LRDP Handbook
for the team members) during the ERRP will estimate the physical resources required to
accomplish the Work Spec. For aircraft, the physical resources’ estimates may include ramp and
hangar space, engine-run test cells, compass row, co-located and assigned industrial (i.e.,
backshop) capability, etc., to the point that tasks and physical resource requirements are
correlated. The team will identify from the Work Spec repair requirements that should logically
be performed by local, ALC-assigned industrial resources, to include correlating the specific task
with a particular ALC industrial capability. The cost of utilizing local ALC industrial capability
is included in the ROM cost projected by the Planner for performing the Work Spec. This
pertains to those items designated for local manufacture, and for off-aircraft/missile
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012                                                  265


repair/process repair routes. The Planner will return the estimate reflecting the man-hours and
occurrence factors required to accomplish the tasks defined within the Work Spec. The
SPO/SPM will input into CAFDEx AMR Module unless role has been delegated to maintenance.

20.31.1.10. (Added) The SPO/SPM will review/negotiate the hours and occurrence factors
provided by maintenance; SPO/SPM will make changes to hours and occurrence factors in the
CAFDEx AMR Module as necessary unless role has been delegated to maintenance. The
SPO/SPM will ensure all material for the Work Spec is stock listed, and supportable. The
SPO/SPM ES will confirm identified items have current, valid contracts, or can be locally
manufactured to support the workload. The Equipment Specialist should treat PDM material
supportability in the same way as MOD/TCTO material supportability, such that it is
programmed, budgeted, and available.

20.31.1.11. (Added) The Work Spec and AMR Brochure is published on 15 November for the
upcoming fiscal year and is available by accessing CAFDEx or contacting the SPO/SPM.

20.31.1.12. (Added) The SPO/SPM will complete development of the AMR Brochure and
Work Spec by Program Year. The AMR Brochure includes tasks, approved hours, occurrence
factors, and number of aircraft/missiles scheduled to work per year by MDS; the Work Spec
includes tasks only. The AMR process is documented in the Logistics Requirements
Determination Process (LRDP) Guide which can be located on the CAM CoP:
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=23211

20.32. (Added) Develop and Approve Fiscal Year Plan.

20.32.1. (Added) The Planner will perform analyses of the workload defined by the approved
Work Spec to establish the optimal flow-plan of aircraft/missile through the available depot
facilities in accordance with known PDM and MOD requirements. Also included in this analysis
will be historical UDLM requirements for a given fiscal year. The results of this analysis will
determine the quantity of aircraft/missile maintenance can accommodate for the FY along with
the required number of flowdays.

20.32.2. (Added) The Planner/Master Scheduler will develop the fiscal year Input-Output plan.
The analysis will define facility and workload variables that may impact the negotiated delivery
date(s). The result of this analysis will reflect the required sequencing of aircraft/missile input to
the depot by arrival date (draft Input-Output schedule). The developed draft Input-Output
schedule forms the basis for any future analysis for proposed additional workloads (e.g.,
UDLM/”drop-in”) for the given FY plus provides the foundation for development of the Master
Plan that grows in specificity as a tail/serial-number-specific network. Simulation(s)/analysis of
the developed Work Spec is critical to accurately determining the annual schedule, as well as
assessing the impact of any future changes to negotiated delivery dates, inputs, etc.

20.32.3. (Added) The Master Scheduler and Planner will review the draft Input-Output
schedule, perform “rough-cut capacity planning”, and verify that available facilities will
accommodate the planned sequencing of aircraft through available PDM/MOD production
resources. The Master Scheduler and Planner will identify any conflicts, recommend solutions
266                                            AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012


in the form of a revised Input-Output schedule, and forward it to the SPO/SPM. The SPO/SPM
will distribute the developed Input-Output schedule to the MAJCOMs so they know when to
send aircraft/missile to the depot.

20.33. (Added) Validate Resources by Task.

20.33.1. (Added) The Planner as part of the BOW will use appropriate sources (e.g., D043,
FedLog, Engineer’s LOM, etc.) to identify material required to perform each task specified in the
WCD, and transform the engineered LOM into a Planning BOM by MDS, detailed to the
operation level. The Planner will link the material identified on the engineered LOM to each
planned operation, coded by operation number. The MDS BOM is referred to as the “Planning
BOM.” (Reference AFMCI 21-130, Depot Maintenance Material Control.) The Planner will
review the Material Requirement List, and compare it to the work package. The Planner will
compare programmed requirements against actual usage from the previous year, and identify any
variance. In the case of variance, the Planner will determine the cause, and make appropriate
adjustments to the BOM.

20.33.2. (Added) The Planner as part of the BOW will review the aircraft/missile PDM/MOD
schedule as it relates to tasks by skill in the production scheduling system, plus relevant
simulation(s)/analysis results, and will note where all job-hours are networked into the schedule
(Planned Labor Application). The AMR Brochure hours, simulation(s)/analysis developed in
G037F or other simulation(s)/analysis tools, and aircraft/missile history is used to project annual,
quarterly, and monthly aircraft/missile PDM/MOD personnel resource requirements by work
package. The developed report will include the total mix and quantity of skills required
accomplishing the work package by month, plus report skill shortages or overages.
Skill/personnel shortfalls or overages are identified to the Production Support Flight Chief.

20.33.3. (Added) The Collaborative Functional Team during the ERRP will use TOs,
engineering specifications, etc. to develop a list of special tools by task. The team will identify
special tool shortfalls (for tools required but not in inventory). The team will determine the
facility resource requirements. The team will identify facility requirements for new and existing
work. The Planner as part of the BOW will link the special tool requirements to specific
operations.

20.34. (Added) Develop, Simulate, and Refine the Work Package.

20.34.1. (Added) The Planner as part of the BOW will use the tasks identified in the Work
Specification to develop individual operations. The Planner will determine the logical
components of the task, and plan them as individual operations. The Planner will load developed
operations into the Production Scheduling System.

20.34.2. (Added) The Planner as part of the BOW will review all operations from all tasks
defined in the Work Spec and determine the appropriate sequencing with the assistance of first-
line supervisors and mechanics. Those operations, when sequenced based upon dependency,
define the critical path. Defined and sequenced operations are then grouped into major jobs in
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012                                               267


the Production Scheduling System.

20.34.3. (Added) Operations and major jobs, which do not impact the critical path, are
considered “Auxiliary/Parallel”. The Planner as part of the BOW will determine the resource
requirements for tasks, and load those operations into the schedule, subordinate to resource
requirements of the critical path. The result is an MDS-specific network of dependent operations
built around the critical path, plus non-critical operations which are sequenced with critical path
operations, into a schedule that is optimized to available resources.

20.35. (Added) Job Routing.

20.35.1. (Added) The decision to Job Route/Non Job Route will be made by the SPO/SPM or
AFGLSC, as appropriate, working with the MXW and DLA. Normal practice is for an
unserviceable asset to be turned into supply in exchange for an available serviceable asset.
Consequently, job routed repair is not authorized if a serviceable asset is available from supply in
the configuration required. All conversions from job routed to non job routed should begin
budget lead-time away for anticipated cost changes to the CSAG-MD/CSAG-S. If
circumstances still require job routing, such action must be reported to supply in order for supply
to record accurately the true requirements for stockage.

20.35.2. (Added) Job Routed Repair. Job routed repair occurs when a recoverable component is
found to be unserviceable during the overhaul, the item is removed, repaired/reconditioned, and
reinstalled on the same end item. Job routing between ALCs is not authorized.

20.35.3. (Added) Non Job Routed Repair. Non job routed repair occurs when an unserviceable
item is removed and replaced with a serviceable item from supply. A non-routing process is a
strictly remove and replace operation.

20.35.4. (Added) Procedures for Job Routing: (As approved by the SPO/SPM or AFGLSC)

20.35.4.1. (Added) The appropriate WCDs will be developed and used as required by Chapter
19. All job-routed repairs are to be input and tracked though the repair process via the
appropriate data system.

20.36. (Added) Process Routing.

20.36.1. (Added) Process routing, which consists of forwarding an item to a process shop, is an
integral part of the overall repair effort but isn’t considered a job route. A process shop is
defined as a DM function that provides conditioning support on component assemblies and
materials, or essential support services for end items being repaired by other DM organizations.
The following are examples of candidates for process routing: cleaning, plating, heat treat,
welding, battery servicing, grinding, machining, NDIs, check/test, and minor maintenance (Not
to Exceed Level Three Field Repairs).

20.37. (Added) MOD Requirements.
268                                            AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012


20.37.1. (Added) The SPO Program Manager (PM) in conjunction with the SPO/SPM Engineer
and Lead Command will prepare the MOD package or SOW/TCTO. The Planner will evaluate
the impact of the proposed MOD against depot capacity to include facilities, equipment, and
manpower. The Planner will develop and execute simulation(s)/analysis to determine the impact
of loading the MOD into the network. The Planner will identify any resource constraints caused
by loading the MOD into the network. Specific constraint information must include quantity and
type of resource required to accomplish the task, availability of the required resource during the
execution period of that task, and impact to resource availability, based upon the resource
requirements for all other tasks for all other scheduled aircraft/missile during that same period.
The system should similarly reflect the impact upon resource availability of removing a
particular task from the workload.

20.37.2. (Added) The Planner will determine the number of hours required to accomplish the
MOD. In the network, these hours are measured in flowdays. Following the MOD kit proof, the
Planner will refine their estimate of required hours to perform the MOD. If adjustments to the
ROM and schedule are required, they are accomplished at this time.

20.37.3. (Added) If the MOD Kit Proof is accomplished at a SOR different from the location(s),
which will actually perform the work, or if only a ‘Trial Install’ was accomplished, the Planner
will review the PDM and MOD work scheduled on the same aircraft to identify redundant
activities. The Planner will also review the Work Spec and applicable technical data for
duplicate or obsolete material. The Planner will identify and validate duplicate Work Specs and
operational checks. The Master Scheduler will determine where, within the annual plan,
MOD(s) should be scheduled, and identifies any conflicts with scheduled work. The Planner
will ensure MOD tasks that are redundant to the PDM are not incorporated into the MDS
network. This is not just a concurrent block of time for the MOD, but rather a total integration of
MOD operations with PDM operations where possible.

20.38. (Added) Unprogrammed Depot Level Maintenance (UDLM) Requirements.

20.38.1. (Added) The customer (Lead Command/FMS) generates a work request to the
SPO/SPM for Unprogrammed work IAW TO 00-25-107, Maintenance Assistance, or by
submitting an AFTO Form 103, Aircraft/Missile Condition Data, in accordance with TO 00-25-
4, Depot Maintenance of Aerospace Vehicles and Training Equipment. It is the responsibility of
the SPO to ensure supportability prior to forwarding the workload request to maintenance. The
Planner will prepare the ROM based on tasks and LOM. The SPO will coordinate with the
Master Scheduler and the owning unit to schedule aircraft/missile arrival. The SPO/SPM will
complete AFMC Form 206 or AFMC Form 181, Project Order, using the coordinated fund site.
The SPO/SPM will forward the completed AFMC Form 206 or AFMC Form 181 to
Maintenance.

20.38.2. (Added) Following receipt of the AFMC Form 206, the Planner will activate the
AFMC Form 206 in G004L. The Planner will prepare the UDLM WCD. The Planner will
review the AFTO Form 103 or TO 00-25-107 and translate the tasks on the AFTO Form 103 or
TO 00-25-107 into operations on a WCD. The Planner will identify hours per operations by
using TOs or engineering guidance/drawings. If a LOM for the UDLM does not accompany the
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012                                               269


AFTO Form 103 or TO 00-25-107, the Planner develops the LOM using available technical
information. The Planner identifies the non-material resource requirements for each operation
defined on the WCD, to include skills, equipment, special tools, facilities, etc.

20.38.3. (Added) The SPO/SPM will coordinate the developed price for the UDLM with the
customer, and prepare an AFMC Form 181 to identify the funding citation. The SPO/SPM will
coordinate induction timing with the customer. The SPO/SPM will forward the AFMC Form
206 and schedule to Maintenance. Upon receipt of the AFMC Form 206 and expected induction
date, the Planner will input labor hours and material into G004L which will assign the JON.

20.38.4. (Added) The Planner will develop a tail/serial number specific, operational LOM by
correlating items from the BOM with specific UDLM operations for a particular aircraft/missile
and loading that information into the appropriate database. This LOM is not the same as that
developed within G005M for planned PDM. The Planner will develop the UDLM WCD in
accordance with governing directives. The Planner will assign an operation number to each
UDLM operation, associate each operation with the appropriate RCC, and input the data into the
appropriate system against the UDLM T-JON.

20.38.5. (Added) The Master Scheduler will integrate the UDLM schedule into the MDS
network. Once the UDLM schedule is input into the planning system (e.g., G097, etc.),
supportability reviews of all resources against that schedule are possible.

20.39. (Added) Unpredictable Requirements.

20.39.1. (Added) There are two types of unpredictable requirements: those that are work
specification (project) related and those that are not (non-project). These can be discovered
during records review (accomplished at the Pre-Induction Conference), Pre-Dock Inspections
(NDI, E&I) and aircraft/missile disassembly, In-Dock activities (mechanic “stumble-ons”), or
Post-Dock activities (functional test or check flight). The individual who discovers the
unpredictable requirement or initiator is responsible to document it (e.g., AFMC Form 173,
MDS/Project Operation Assignment, 959, etc.). The Planner will identify unpredictable
requirements during the Pre-Induction Conference when reviewing aircraft records and AFTO
Forms 103 supplied by the customer prior to aircraft/missile arrival. For the purpose of this
instruction, the following definitions clarify terms used to describe unpredictable requirements.

20.39.2. (Added) Work Specification (project) Related Unpredictables. These are requirements
that are defined or can be related to one of the work codes in the work specification document.
These discrepancies within the scope of the Work Spec have a negotiated block of hours/money
available to assign against in the course of performing programmed maintenance. Each
operation will have a block of hours allocated.

20.39.3. (Added) Over and Above (O&A) Unpredictables (non-work spec/non project related).
These are requirements that cannot be directly related to a work code in the current work spec,
but should be complied with for safety, or because it is more economical to do the work at the
depot. O&A Unpredictables will not be accomplished without prior Project Administration
Officer (PAO) or as applicable, an Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO) approval. The
270                                           AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012


PAO/ACO may give advance work approval as locally supplemented. (Note: As applicable,
PAO functions apply to ACO activities in support of a contracted workload.)

20.39.4. (Added) Unpredictables are either planned or unplanned based on the expected
frequency of the work and the nature of the operation (complexity and criticality). The only
difference between the two is that the planned has a work package pre-built and ready to drop.

20.39.5. (Added) High-Frequency Planned Operations. These are normally expected to occur
for more than 20 percent but less than 100 percent of the aircraft/missile tail/serial numbers.
These operations are fully planned.

20.39.6. (Added) Low-Frequency Planned Operations. These operations occur less than 20
percent but are planned when work is critical or complex.

20.39.7. (Added) Low-Frequency Unplanned Operations. Unpredictable requirements within
the scope of the Work Spec which are normally expected to occur less than 20 percent of the
time. Prior to being worked by Production, Planner must approve unpredictable Work Spec
related requirements (not planned low percent). If necessary, the Maintenance Review Team
(MRT)/missile Production Planning Team (PPT) can be assembled to assist this process. The
MRT/PPT is composed of: Scheduler, 1st Line Supervisor, Planner and PAO (Quality, PST, and
Records as needed). If approved by the Planner, the work is systematically assigned an
operation number and incorporated into the production schedule. Discrepancies not approved for
work by the Planner are archived and presented to the customer when the aircraft/missile is
delivered and Carried Forward to Home Station (CFHS). The PAO approves and funds the
authorization if the work is determined to be O&A (i.e., not part of the funded work package).

20.39.8. (Added) Production, the Planner, and the PAO review Unpredictable Requirements,
and determine the impact and cost on planned PDM/MOD operations. If the discrepancy is
project related, or represents a “safety of flight” problem, the necessary task to correct the
discrepancy is loaded into the PDM work package. Overrun of hours for project work will not
drive additional funds; these tasks are trended and will be adjusted during the annual review. If
the PAO approves the non-project work, the Planner and SPO/SPM will adjust the Fixed Price
Sheet to reflect the additional work. If the over and above hours have been expended and more
hours are required, the PAO will be notified. The Workloader approves and forwards the Fixed
Price Sheet to the project order issuer for creation of an amended AFMC Form 181 to increase
the PAO’s budget authority. Unprogrammed, unpredictable tasks must be tracked by the
Production Support Flight to the degree that the Planner can present that data to the customer
during subsequent AMRs for the purpose of including recurring unprogrammed, unpredictable
tasks into future negotiated Work Specs. If the PAO determines the identified discrepancy either
falls outside the scope of the PDM/UDLM/MOD and is not “safety of flight”, or otherwise
determines that they will not fund the repair identified by the Engineer, maintenance will not
perform the work and the discrepancy will be archived and entered on AFTO Forms 781, ARMS
Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, /AFTO Forms 95, Significant Historical Data. In either
case, a re-evaluation of the PDM time-line may be required to account for the addition of the
new task. Such accounting would include the additional facilities, tools, manpower, and material
inherent in the task. If the work is added to the work package, the PDM/MOD schedule and
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012                                               271


supportability will be re-worked to account for the new task.

20.39.9. (Added) Discrepancies discovered after aircraft/missile arrival that have been planned
as “low-frequency” operations will be qualified (e.g., it is funded, material can be ordered
against it, etc.) by the Scheduler after Planner approval. Once qualified, the production
scheduling system will issue the WCDs associated with the planned task at the start of the
associated major job.

20.39.10. (Added) Low frequency project related operations must be clearly stated in the Work
Spec and included as work or inspection requirements in the work package. These normally
occur for less than 20 percent of the serial numbers. Formal work planning is not always
completed on low frequency project related operations. Hand scribed or system generated
documents can be used if no formal WCDs are available. The Planner, as part of the PPT, will
perform a risk analysis of all “safety of flight” related low frequency unplanned operations based
on the complexity and criticality of the work required. If the Planner determines there is
significant risk involved in the operation or if the nature of the work justifies it (e.g., very
complex, high cost etc.), the formal work planning process will be applied and WCDs will be
prepared to support the work even if it is expected to be used on less than 20 percent of the tail
numbers.

20.39.11. (Added) The mechanic/technician discovering the requirement for unpredictable work
is responsible to document the discrepancy and ensure the applicable WCDs are initiated to
include all follow-on maintenance actions. All discrepancy documentation will reference
applicable technical data to include any follow-on actions (i.e. ops checks) required by the
technical data, and part number, TO, figure and index. Prior to work being accomplished, the
first level supervisor reviews the documentation to ensure the proper Production Acceptance
Certification (PAC) requirements are included and the information is complete. A Maintenance
Work Request (MWR) is then generated if the automated PDMSS capability exists. If the
automated capability does not exist and the maintenance actions have not been previously
planned, the Scheduler will submit the hand-scribed AFMC Form 173 to the Planner. The
Planner will periodically review O&A occurrences and initiate full planning for those operations
that occur frequently enough to justify this action. The Non-project related O&A WCDs are
processed to the PAO for approval.

20.39.12. (Added) The mechanic/technician must be trained on their unpredictable work
requirement documentation responsibilities. The training provided will include the responsibility
for ensuring the WCDs are generated and how to prepare the work sheets/AFMC Forms 173/959
forms. The training provided will also stress that all follow-on maintenance actions required by
the technical data must be documented. In addition, the training provided must include the
proper use of AFTO Forms 781 and AFTO Forms 95 series.

20.39.13. (Added) Routed items must be tracked by work document and identification (aircraft
tail number, serial number, metal tag, etc.) so the mechanic can readily determine if the item is
the original or a substitute item. A copy of the back shop WCD/serviceable tag will accompany
the item back to the aircraft/missile so the installing mechanic is aware of all maintenance
performed. The WCD and/or serviceable tag will be turned into the Scheduler for entry into the
272                                           AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012


aircraft/missile records. If the routed item is a DLA managed item that is process routed for
work due to non-availability of material, the Scheduler from the owning organization will ensure
the appropriate information (NSN, quantity, etc.) is provided to the DLA Customer Support
Specialist to ensure that Demand Data (DHAs) is processed to the DLA SOS.

20.39.14. (Added) The Planner reviews unpredictable discrepancies and determines whether the
identified discrepancy is project/work spec related. If it is project related, the Planner
verifies/corrects hours and accomplishes all other steps required to approve/qualify the task as a
valid operation if hours are available within the existing funding. If the discrepancy is non-
project related or project hours have been expended, the Planner will submit the discrepancy to
the PAO for approval of hours/funding. Discrepancies disapproved by the Planner are forwarded
to the PAO and are archived and will be presented to the customer upon aircraft/missile delivery
and CFHS.

20.39.15. (Added) Production will request/initiate an AFMC Form 202, Nonconforming
Technical Assistance Request and Reply, when there is no applicable technical data for the repair
of the discrepancy and forward to Planning. The Planner verifies there is no applicable technical
data for the repair. The Planner will review the Form 202 archives to verify if an AFTO Form
252, TO Publication Change Request, has been added to the appropriate technical data
(Reference AFMCMAN 21-1, Air Force Materiel Command Technical Order System
Procedures). If an AFMC Form 202/AFTO Form 252 was not accomplished, the AFMC Form
202 is forwarded to the Engineer for review and disposition.

20.39.16. (Added) The cognizant System Engineer reviews the discrepancy as submitted and
determines an appropriate repair disposition. The Engineer will include repair steps along with
any notes or cautions required for the repair. The Engineer then returns the AFMC Form 202 to
the Planner. The Planner accepts the AFMC Form 202 and forwards to Production who accepts
the AFMC Form 202. The AFMC Form 202 becomes an official document at this time.

20.39.17. (Added) If the engineering repair disposition falls under project/work spec, the
Planner will plan the repair with hours and approve the work control document through the
system. If the repair falls under non-project, the Planner will forward the planned hours through
the appropriate system to the PAO for “over & above” funding.

20.39.18. (Added) If the PAO does not have the funding to accomplish the repair, the PAO will
notify the Planner to submit an AFMC Form 206 for funds. A SOW for the repair will be
initiated from the SPO/SPM and the Planner will initiate a rough order of magnitude (ROM).
The requested 206 funds will then be coordinated through the Prime Item Manager (PIM) to
establish a “T” job in G004L for the repair. The Planner will then plan and input the hours by
skill and operation into the production scheduling system for tracking and accountability.

20.39.19. (Added) If the Engineer determines the identified discrepancy is not a defect, the
Engineer will disposition the identified condition as “Serviceable As Is” (SAI). The Engineer
will forward the SAI-202 back to the Planner. The Planner will file the SAI -202 for their
records which are maintained for 2 years. The Planner will forward a copy of the SAI-202 to the
Scheduler of the subject aircraft/missile. The Scheduler will attach the returned SAI-202 to the
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                   26 APRIL 2012                                                 273


discrepancy documentation (AFMC Form 173/WCD) and clear the discrepancy as “no defect.”
The Scheduler will archive the SAI-202 to submit to the customer upon completion of the
maintenance. (Reference AFMCMAN 21-1 for additional guidance.)

20.39.20. (Added) The Planner/PAO/ACO can approve a limited (non-MISTR/overhaul) repair
for an item. The Scheduler will introduce the item into the backshop with a Planner approved –
AFMC Form 173/WCD for a “one-time”, “limited repair” (e.g., Spot Weld). The Scheduler will
route the item to the appropriate backshop for repair.

20.39.21. (Added) When appropriate, the Planner will develop and execute a
simulation(s)/analysis of the developed workload package. The simulation(s)/analysis are run at
the discretion of the Planner depending upon the anticipated impact to the Production Scheduling
System of the Unpredictable Requirement. The Planner will determine whether the
unpredictable requirement is a critical path or parallel operation. It is a critical path event if it
has an identified dependency. Unpredictable requirements will be transformed into a work
package comprised of operations and resources by type. The resources by type will be arrayed
against the tail/serial-number schedule to determine the best fit for the operations in the schedule.
Resource requirements will then be compared against resource availability.

20.39.22. (Added) Delays to schedule, along with the associated costs, will be collected and
reported to P&A Section. This cost will then be reported to upper management. The Planner
will also review the history of low frequency and approved unpredictable tasks to determine
whether those tasks should be included in future work packages or whether the occurrence factor
of low frequencies should be changed.

20.40. (Added) Control Number Selection and Assignment.

20.40.1. (Added) Control numbers for permanent workloads are established by G004L. For
temporary workloads, the Planner will select an individual Control Number from the “block” of
established numbers and add the Job Designator for a specific aircraft/missile by planning year in
accordance with AFMCI 21-156, Operational Workloading, Planning and Scheduling Control.

20.40.2. (Added) The Planner will develop the Master WCD in accordance with governing
instructions. The Planner will assign an operation number to each planned operation. The
Control Number then ties the associated operations to a specific MDS.

20.41. (Added) Aircraft/Missile Status Documentation.

20.41.1. (Added) The following procedures will be used for all aircraft/missile work including
unpredictable operations, low frequency predictable, and all other over and above work
operations not fully planned as part of regular depot activity. Aircraft/missile status
documentation is accomplished by utilizing AFTO Forms 781/AFTO Forms 95 series prior to
induction into DM. After induction, depot WCDs will be used for all other DM work as the sole
source of aircraft/missile status up to the preflight/testing phase. The use of AFTO Forms 781
series will be reinitiated prior to the start of the aircraft initial -6 Functional Check Flight (FCF)
Preflight inspection. The depot procedures are outlined in TO 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment
274                                            AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012


Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Policy and Procedures. During PDM/MOD or other
programmed/unprogrammed maintenance, all work performed shall be documented on depot
WCDs IAW Chapter 19 of this instruction.

20.41.2. (Added) ALC aircraft personnel will debrief aircrews to determine the status of the
aircraft. The aircrews will be debriefed using locally developed procedures or checklists to
determine the airworthy status of the aircraft for any new incoming discrepancies prior to
performance of any depot maintenance.

20.41.3. (Added) Discrepancies from aircraft debrief may be corrected in the AFTO Form
781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document and AFTO Form 781K, Aerospace
Vehicle Inspection, Engine Data, Calendar Inspection and Delayed Discrepancy Document.
Entries to include all delayed discrepancies and inspections must be carried forward to depot
WCDs or transferred to AFTO Forms 781A for completion. If discrepancies are cleared using
AFTO Forms 781A, technical data used to correct the discrepancies must be referenced and the
maintenance technician completing the work will sign off the “Corrected By” block as
prescribed by TO 00-20-1. If discrepancies are transferred to depot WCDs, the “Corrective
Action” blocks of the AFTO Forms 781A and 781K must reference the depot WCDs used to
clear the discrepancies. All uncleared entries in the AFTO Forms 781A and 781K will be
transferred to depot work documents as authorized and described by TO 00-20-1. The statement,
“All preceding uncleared entries transferred to depot WCDs” (specify identification number),
will be annotated in the last block of the AFTO Forms 781A and 781K. Depot maintenance
begins after this action or when all other pre-depot actions are complete as locally defined. The
aircraft’s AFTO Form 781 series will be “closed” by records section personnel and will not be
used to annotate further discrepancies. The aircraft’s records (AFTO Forms 781) will remain
closed until preparation for the initial -6 FCF Preflight begins. The end result must be a
complete audit trail in the AFTO Forms 781 series.

20.41.4. (Added) The aircraft Tail Team including a Planner and Records personnel will
reconcile the AFTO Forms 781 and WCDs prior to the post dock phase. All previously
transferred AFTO Forms 781A or 781K discrepancies and WCDs discrepancies that remain
uncleared will be transcribed to new AFTO Forms 781. The corrective action block must
reference the depot WCD used to clear the discrepancy to provide a clear maintenance audit trail.
New AFTO Forms 781 will be initiated prior to the initial –6 FCF preflight to reflect the current
status information, to include all open discrepancies. The AFTO Forms 781 are used from the
initial –6 FCF preflight onward to document any maintenance performed.
20.41.5. All follow-on aircraft maintenance actions identified after initial pre-brief to crew will
be documented in AFTO Forms 781. Any follow-on maintenance actions required by technical
data will be identified by the responsible mechanic(s) doing the work and entered and cleared
using AFTO Forms 781A series and TO 00-20-1.

20.41.6. (Added) Aircraft maintenance discrepancies or major depot operations discovered after
post-dock activities, such as painting, not previously cleared will be annotated in the AFTO
Forms 781A. All sub-operations required to accomplish major depot operations are documented
on and executed using WCDs. Maintenance discrepancies or major operations annotated in
AFTO Forms 781A must reference all sub-operation WCDs. The maintenance discrepancy or
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                26 APRIL 2012                                              275


major depot operation will be cleared in the AFTO Forms 781A once the sub-operations WCDs
are accomplished.

20.41.7. (Added) After completion of the initial FCF, all In-flight discrepancies, follow-on
maintenance and remaining major PDM operations will be annotated in the AFTO Forms 781
series. WCDs will be issued to accomplish any remaining maintenance activities. When AFTO
Forms 781A discrepancies are closed, a reference to the appropriate technical data will be
annotated in the corrective action block. Per AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status And
Utilization Reporting, maintenance debrief will enter flying time information into REMIS. Per
Chapter 4 of this instruction, ensure flying times and installed engine event history recorder
readings for all FCFs are updated no later than the next duty day after occurrence.

20.41.8. (Added) The Aircraft AFTO Forms 781 are the only source of aircraft status. WCDs
direct what work is to be performed and are not a source to determine aircraft status. These
procedures are to prevent dual documentation of maintenance status in both the AFTO Forms
781 series and depot WCDs.

20.42. (Added) Post Dock Documentation.

20.42.1. (Added) Upon completion of the aircraft In-Dock Maintenance Phase of depot level
maintenance, the Post Dock Review Team (PDRT) will conduct a Post Dock Records Review
(PDRR) using the Post Dock Review Checklist (PDRC), AFMC Form 502.

20.42.1.1. (Added) The PDRT will reconcile all forms and documents using the PDRC AFMC
Form 502, ensuring all required signatures are obtained.

20.42.1.2. (Added) PDRT Required Attendees are the Losing Scheduler/Scheduling Element
(Chair), the Gaining Scheduler/Scheduling Element, the Planner/Planning Element, the
Forms/Records personnel, and the Gaining Post Dock Supervisor or designated alternate.

20.42.1.3. (Added) PDRT Optional Attendees, based on MDS requirements are the Losing
Production Phase Supervisor or designated alternate, the Fuel Foreman, the Gaining PST, and
others as determined by local ALC policy.

20.42.1.4. (Added) All previously transferred AFTO Forms 781A or 781K discrepancies and
WCDs discrepancies that remain uncleared will be transcribed to new AFTO Forms 781. The
corrective action block must reference the depot WCD used to clear the discrepancy to provide a
clear maintenance audit trail. New AFTO Forms 781 will be initiated prior to the initial -6 FCF
preflight to reflect the current status information, to include all open discrepancies. The AFTO
Forms 781 are used from the initial -6 FCF preflight onward to document any maintenance
performed.

20.43. (Added) Supportability Reviews.

20.43.1. (Added) The SPO/SPM (Program Office) is responsible for performing supportability
reviews outlined in the Engineering Requirements Review Process (ERRP) and Requirements
276                                            AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012


Supportability Process outlined in the Logistics Requirements Determination Process (LRDP)
Handbook and Guide located on the Centralized Asset Management CoP:
https://akm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx??Filter=23211. These reviews are
designed to determine supportability of maintenance requirements.

20.43.1.1. (Added) The ERRP drives the generation of a new engineering requirement from
conception through approval by providing justification with fully developed supportability
elements. In addition, it directs a review of existing scheduled maintenance tasks for validity.
An initial supportability review is performed during this process.

20.43.1.2. (Added) The Requirements Supportability Process identifies the supportability
elements, roles/responsibilities and process steps to ensure the scheduled maintenance tasks in
the Aircraft Missile Requirements (AMR) Work Spec, AMR Brochure, and Bill of Work (BOW)
are supportable.

20.43.2. (Added) Supportability assessment/reviews: There are three levels of supportability
assessments/reviews to be conducted as part of the overarching requirements process.

20.43.2.1. (Added) Strategic Supportability: Occurs through FYDP until the brochure is
published. A strategic supportability assessment reviews all scheduled maintenance tasks
(Strategic BOW) for a MDS (i.e. is not tail or serial number specific).

20.43.2.2. (Added) Operational Supportability: Occurs from when the brochure is published to
aircraft/missile induction. Based on the operational tail/serial number (as applicable) specific
BOW – assumes all identified supportability elements are or will be available 31 days prior to
task execution schedule. The task review scheduled maintenance task(s) will be accomplished
90 days prior to execution of the task(s).

20.43.2.3. (Added) Tactical Supportability: Occurs from aircraft/missile induction to
aircraft/missile produced date. The task review is based on availability of supportability
elements to meet task execution schedule. Responsibility for supportability is outlined in
Chapter 15 of the LRDP Handbook. Maintenance will identify unpredictable requirements
discovered from induction to completion for the SPO/SPM to determine supportability.

20.43.2.4. (Added) Supportability Elements for all reviews: The elements to be reviewed for
supportability are: Parts; Air Force Global Logistics Center (AFGLSC) managed, Defense
Logistics Agency (DLA) managed (that also include General Support Division (GSD), Local
Purchased, and Local Manufactured); Support Equipment; Special Tooling; Common Tooling;
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE); HAZMAT; Manpower/skills; Production Support Center
(PSC) or “Blue Straw” or “Tool Crib” material; and Facilities/utilities.

20.43.3. (Added) Tactical Supportability (Tail Team/Missile PFT Rolling Ten Day “Forward
Look”).

20.43.3.1. (Added) This review occurs in rolling two week windows (i.e. ten workdays).
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012                                                277


Accountable Tail Teams/PFTs consisting of a Scheduler, Planner, PST, and Aircraft/Missile
Supervisor, will be assigned to individual aircraft/missile tail/serial numbers. The number of
aircraft/missile each Tail Team/PFT is responsible for and the skill level of Tail Team/PFT
members are based upon schedule requirements. The Tail Team/PFT will have complete
responsibility for task execution on their assigned aircraft/missile. The Scheduler will control
execution of the tail/serial number-specific production schedule, and will release only
supportable WCDs to the Aircraft/Missile Supervisor. The Aircraft/Missile Supervisor will
adhere to the tail/serial number-specific production schedule as closely as skill availability
allows. The PST will ensure parts are ordered and coordinate with DLA the delivery of material
to the aircraft/missile. Tail Team/PFT members will review the status of the weekly production
plan for each aircraft/missile assigned to the Tail Team/PFT daily. The Scheduler/PST will
coordinate delivery of Special Equipment, and the availability of Special Tools, for each
aircraft/missile IAW scheduled operation start.

20.43.3.2. (Added) The Planner will identify items, which can be logically associated by
operation and packaged together/kitted for delivery. To what degree material is planned into
operational packages will be locally determined.

20.43.3.4. (Added) If a review by the Scheduler, PST, or mechanic reveals some local
Operation Package items that were not loaded/identified in the material planning system (e.g.,
D230, G005M), the Scheduler/PST will contact the Planner, who will add that item to the local
operation/material list.

20.43.3.5. (Added) The DLA Sustainment Specialist/Customer Support Specialist will similarly
review items for which the EDD has slipped, and determine if the new EDD threatens the
schedule, or otherwise warrants additional action.

20.43.3.6. (Added) The PST will confirm availability of MOD kits or PDM/UDLM operation
packages to meet the RDD for individual aircraft/missile, according to the PDM/UDLM/MOD
schedule. Planners will locally determine the appropriate replacement factor and occurrence rate
for material to include in kits and operation packages.

20.43.3.7. (Added) The PST may separate existing mod kits by Operation Number. The
members of the Tail Team/PFT will review the status of the aircraft/missile, to include schedule
progress, material supportability projections (ten-day to two-week forward look), available
manpower, etc., and coordinate available resources toward accomplishment of the production
schedule. The Scheduler will appraise schedule status, and determine which operations are next
in the schedule and provide the operations to the PST. The PST will brief material supportability
of operations scheduled for the period of the forward-look. The PST will provide the Scheduler
and Aircraft/Missile Supervisor with a list of operations that are supportable. The
Aircraft/Missile Supervisor will review the scheduled operations falling within the “window” of
the forward look, and determine if manpower/skills are available.

20.43.3.8. (Added) Based upon the review of schedule, material supportability, and
manpower/skills availability, the Tail Team/PFT will make required adjustments to the schedule.
Appropriate delay codes will be entered against unsupportable operations. A report of non-
278                                             AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                   26 APRIL 2012


supportable and delay-coded operations will be available in the scheduling system. The
Aircraft/Missile Supervisor will perform a forward look of hours by skill required to perform
supportable scheduled operations. The Aircraft/Missile Supervisor will report overages and
shortfalls by skills to the Production Flight Chief, who will reallocate available skills to support
the total master system schedule (i.e., allocate manpower to and from other aircraft/missile).

20.43.3.9. (Added) The Aircraft/Missile Supervisor and mechanics will meet as required at
beginning of shift to ensure effective crew communication (turnover log, supportable WCDs, kit
status and locations, etc.) occurs between shifts. Daily crew meetings will occur at shift overlap
(if applicable). The purpose is to receive and pass the status of work to the next shift, and
provide information regarding supportable WCDs and work packages to the next shift. Second
and third shifts will also pass on information regarding work accomplished for day shift support
resolution, if appropriate. The Aircraft/Missile Supervisor will ensure critical path operations are
continued across all shifts and will deliver reports to relieving supervisors regarding critical path
accomplishment.

20.43.3.10. (Added) The Squadron Commander/Director will chair a weekly meeting with the
appropriate support section managers. As a minimum, critical path planned vs. critical path
completed, flow days planned vs. flow days completed, and negotiated output date vs.
Production Scheduling System projected output date will be reviewed for each aircraft/missile.
The Squadron Commander/Director will assign action items to the appropriate support section
manager(s) for problems that are beyond the scope of the Tail Team/PFT to resolve. Action
Items will be answered by the next working day. The Production Support Flight will work
logistics issues. The Production Chiefs will resolve skill issues to ensure integrity of the Master
(all aircraft/missile) Schedule. If a change in the operations scheduled within a ten-day window
is required, the Scheduler and/or Aircraft/Missile Supervisor will adjust the operation execution
date, as appropriate, within the confines of resource availability to optimize schedule execution,
such that the negotiated aircraft/missile delivery date is unaffected. The Scheduler will
coordinate with the Master Scheduler to resolve changes that fall outside the ten-day window.

20.43.3.11. (Added) The Scheduler will coordinate for the delivery of special or AGE
equipment. Production will notify the Tool Crib to expect demand for specific special tools
required to execute the schedule by operation. The PST will coordinate with the Material
Handler/Expediter to deliver equipment required to execute the schedule by operation.

20.43.3.12. (Added) The Master Scheduler will review all overtime requests. If overtime is
required to protect the schedule, the Master Scheduler will determine the optimal apportionment
of that overtime by aircraft/missile.

20.43.4. (Added) UDLM Supportability Review.

20.43.4.1. (Added) Prior to induction, the Planner will perform a complete supportability
analysis on UDLM required work package for all resources (technical data, material, equipment,
special tools, skills, facilities, etc.) required to support the UDLM. The Planner will evaluate the
output of the resource determination and simulation(s)/analysis, compare them with all resource
requirements for all other work scheduled during the same period, and identify any shortfalls to
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012                                               279


the SPO/SPM. The Master Scheduler will coordinate with the SPO/SPM and schedule the
UDLM work within the fiscal year Production Schedule. The Planner will enter the JON into
G004L and coordinate creation of a specific Tail/Serial Number Schedule.

20.44. (Added) Establish and Open Serialized JON.

20.44.1. (Added) The Planner will identify a specific tail/serial number and JON against a
Control Number, and forward it to a Workloader. The Workloader will activate the obligation of
funds against the specific tail number in G004L. When inputting the three digit JON suffix to
the existing five-digit Control Number with a single-field Job Designator, the resultant nine-digit
number will account for costs and resource control by tail/serial number.

20.44.2. (Added) The Planner will “serialize” the JON (i.e. links a specific aircraft/missile serial
number to a three-digit JON suffix). The Planner will then forward this information to the
Workloader. The Workloader then will input the serial number/JON suffix data into G004L. At
this point, CSAG-MD funds become available in the Maintenance Data Systems for use.

20.44.3. (Added) The SPO/SPM will provide the task listing to the Planner. Tasks are
categorized as either “fixed-price” or “options”. The Planner will validate which tasks on the list
will be worked. The validated list is used to make final adjustments to the tail/serial-number
specific work package by loading the appropriate options into the production scheduling system.

20.44.4. (Added) The Planner will select operations by Work Categories and Configuration
Codes, and input them into the production scheduling system, which connects to G004L (for
production count). The result is a tail-number/serial-number specific schedule by operation.

20.44.5. (Added) The Scheduler or Planner will open applicable control numbers connected to
the JON in the cost accounting system (G004L). Opening of the JON (control numbers) for
materials ordering may occur 30 or more days prior to aircraft/missile arrival within the same
fiscal year.

20.45. (Added) Request and Order Material.

20.45.1. (Added) Direct Exchangeable Items.

20.45.1.1. (Added) The PST turns in the repairable item through ABOM/NIMMS and orders a
serviceable item. The cost of a new unit is charged against the aircraft/missile JON. The DLA
Customer Support Specialist will monitor status of all direct exchangeable items on order to
determine capability to satisfy depot demands. If the requisition status does not meet the RDD
and cannot be expedited, supportability options may include:

20.45.1.1.1. (Added) Raise priority to MICAP when the condition is within 31 days of a
particular system operational check (critical path). (See AFMAN 23-110.)

20.45.1.1.2. (Added) Initiate a "T" JON (AFMC Form 206) for local repair or manufacture of
the item.
280                                            AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012



20.45.1.1.3. (Added) Authorization to cannibalize the item. (See AFMCI 21-130.)

20.45.1.1.4. (Added) Send unserviceable unit to respective “backshops” for repair with the
repaired item going to the Tail Number Bin (TNB)/Missile Serial Number Bin (SNB) when
complete if the item is not needed immediately at the aircraft/missile.

20.45.1.1.5. (Added) Notify the customer that the negotiated delivery date will slip day-by-day,
and that additional costs in overtime may be incurred to get the aircraft/missile back on schedule.

20.45.2. (Added) Planned Material.

20.45.2.1. (Added) The PST will review a LOM for each operation within the current two-week
"window" for each tail/serial number.

20.45.2.2. (Added) Request(s) for material, not pre-positioned at the aircraft/missile, will be
submitted into the Material Processing System (MPS-D230) or other designated material
processing system to support the current two-week schedule "window". The location and timing
of pre-positioning of material will be determined locally, as appropriate. The Scheduler/PST
will determine what material to order, when to order it and where it should be delivered (e.g., to
the aircraft/missile or TNB/SNB).

20.45.2.3. (Added) While working on the aircraft/missile, the mechanic can identify an item(s)
required to accomplish the planned operation. The mechanic reviews and determines the items
required to accomplish the specific operation. The mechanic will also identify material required
to accomplish “install” operations immediately following execution of any associated "remove"
operation.

20.45.2.4. (Added) The mechanic will pull bench stock material required to complete an
operation unless the IPV contractor performs kitting of these items. The IPV contractor will
replenish bench stock items in accordance with the quantities identified during routine
inventories.

20.45.3. (Added) Unplanned Material Request.

20.45.3.1. (Added) The mechanic/PST will request material via the material ordering system
with the priority necessary to meet the RDD shown in the operational schedule. Material
requests for "Unpredictable" (not planned against the operation, or quantity exceeding that
planned against the operation) will be sent to the Planner for review and approval for NON-
BOM material if appropriate. (See AFMCI 21-130.)

20.45.3.2. (Added) The Planner receives and reviews NON-BOM material requests for
unprogrammed material in the Material Module of the appropriate production scheduling system.
The Planner will determine if the requested material should be planned against an operation, if
the material was previously ordered, or if it was erroneously ordered for a different operation.
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012                                              281


The Planner reviews the quantity ordered against the tail/serial-number-specific LOM quantity
and Units Per Assembly (UPA). Note: For G097 users only, if the Planner determines that the
material should be ordered, the Planner will change the status code in the Material Module to
"Approved". Planner approval triggers the MPS (D230) to overlay the material data included in
the request into ABOM/NIMMS to order the material.

20.45.4. (Added) Resolve Stock Ineffectiveness Via Supportability Options.

20.45.4.1. (Added) The PST will track the status of all outstanding backorders on a daily basis
and notify the DLA Customer Support Specialist if status is not adequate.

20.45.4.2. (Added) DLA Customer Support Specialist will notify the “Sync Team” to update the
“Hot Item” list. Hot Item is a term for a required item in which the EDD exceeds the RDD that
is being processed or repaired. The Scheduler will provide the item RDD to the Sync Team.
The Sync Team will update the Hot Item list with the new RDDs. With manufactured/routed
items the Hot Item list will also be updated to reflect the process of repairing the item, as
opposed to the original intent of replacing the item (manufacture pieces of a part as opposed to
manufacture of the end-item with an NSN or locally assigned P number).

20.45.5. (Added) Work-Arounds.

20.45.5.1. (Added) The Scheduler and Aircraft /Missile Supervisor will develop work-arounds
when required to compensate for delays in material supportability (EDD exceeds RDD).
Examples of work-around include re-arranging major jobs, crew size adjustments, multiple
shifts, overtime, etc. Based upon the flow days impact of the developed work-around, the
Scheduler and Aircraft/Missile Supervisor will determine whether to delay execution of a
scheduled operation. The following rules apply for developing work-arounds:

20.45.5.1.1. (Added) Identify and work major jobs that do not affect the major job of the “Hot
Item”, i.e., work jobs that are parallel to the major job of the Hot Item, but are not on the
schedule critical path.

20.45.5.1.2. (Added) Man-load the installation major job (apply more people in the current
shift) of the hot item to get the major job back on schedule.

20.45.5.1.3. (Added) Apply multiple shifts to the “install” major job of the hot item.

20.45.5.1.4. (Added) Apply overtime to the install major job of the hot item.

20.45.5.1.5. (Added) Cannibalization (CANN) Actions

20.45.5.2. (Added) If all efforts to acquire the required material by the RDD fail, the Scheduler
will review what (if any) CANN options exist and will initiate CANN procedures in accordance
with AFMCI 21-130. The Scheduler will forward the number of CANNs, and the number of
labor hours consumed to perform CANNs, to the P&A Section for analysis and reporting to the
SPO/SPM and the Squadron Commander/Director. All supply documentation will be processed
282                                            AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012


to ensure the correct JON is charged.

20.45.5.3. (Added) When the CANN is approved, the Scheduler prepares the required CANN
paperwork and the mechanic will remove the required item from the “donor” aircraft/missile.
The PSS will deliver the item to the receiving aircraft/missile.

20.45.5.4. (Added) CANN actions are a last resort option to obtain a part or component. Since
maintenance is not reimbursed for labor and other costs to perform CANNS, this procedure
should be avoided if other avenues to secure the item are available. The Scheduler will initiate
documentation for CANN actions. Note: This does not include CANN actions directed by the
SPO via an AFMC Form 206 in support of the Field.

20.45.5.5. (Added) Engineering Disposition and Schedule Change.

20.45.5.5.1. (Added) If all attempts to resolve a material shortfall fail, the Tail Team/PFT will
request an Engineering disposition (AFMC IMT 202). The Tail Team/PFT will request
Engineering to determine whether the discrepancy represents a “safety of flight” condition. If
not, the aircraft/missile can be returned to the customer without repairing the identified
discrepancy. The discrepancy will be archived, and the schedule will not be changed.

20.45.5.5.1.1. (Added) If the discrepancy does represent a “safety of flight” condition, the
Scheduler will initiate a schedule change through the Master Scheduler to the SPO/SPM via
appropriate channels. The schedule change represents a slippage of the negotiated delivery date.
The Scheduler and Tail Team/PFT can effect schedule changes peculiar to a specific
aircraft/missile, which do not impact other aircraft/missile schedules.

20.45.5.5.1.2. (Added) The Master Scheduler will evaluate the impact of the recommended
change upon the total system schedule. If the Master Scheduler determines that system priorities
and resource constraints require a change to the aircraft/missile schedule, they will direct the
Planner to effect the appropriate change to the tail/serial number network.

20.46. (Added) Receive, Store, and Deliver Material.

20.46.1. (Added) DLA will receive and inspect incoming material for obvious damage, check
for correct documentation, and deliver to point of use (POU).

20.46.2. (Added) Material received from maintenance that was removed to FOM will be
maintained electronically or manually. The aircraft/missile mechanic is responsible for attaching
proper documentation to the item removed to FOM and will notify the PSS. The PSS will move
the item into the FOM storage area. The first line supervisor is responsible for ensuring that
items removed by the mechanics are identified and presented to the PSS for input in a timely
manner. (See AFMCI 21-130.)

20.46.3. (Added) The Planner will review the system-generated data on unplanned
manufactured items. The Planner notes the occurrence factor (i.e., number of issues) for each
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012                                                283


item. If the Planner notes a "significant" quantity of issues for the item, the Planner may elect to
plan that item against the operation.

20.46.4. (Added) The Planner will advise the Equipment Specialist to update the Acquisition
Advice Code for items if recorded usage history so warrants.

20.46.5. (Added) The PST will turn in discrepant material received by maintenance to the DLA
Shop Service Center (SSC) for credit. DLA will initiate a Report of Discrepancy (ROD) for any
discrepant material received.

20.46.6. (Added) Item Delivery In Accordance With Schedule and Requirements

20.46.6.1. (Added) The DLA material handler will deliver items directly to the PSS. Any
material stored within the FOM/TNB/SNB will be delivered by the PSS to the aircraft when
required. Oversized items delivered directly from the “backshop” will be moved to the
aircraft/missile by the AF material expeditor.

20.46.6.2. (Added) Items that cannot be delivered by the PSS (e.g., HAZMAT or tools) will be
picked-up by the mechanic.

20.46.6.3. (Added) The PST is the primary agent for receipt of material at the aircraft/missile.
Other personnel at the aircraft/missile (e.g., Scheduler, Aircraft/Missile Supervisor, and
mechanic) may also receipt material.

20.46.6.4. (Added) Mechanics will initiate a Quality Deficiency Report (QDR) any time they
identify a delivered item to be discrepant that does not meet form, fit, or function, and notify the
PST that a replacement will be required. QDR procedures are identified in T.O. 00-35D-54.

20.47. (Added) Measure Results and Analyze Trends.

20.47.1. (Added) The P&A will monitor and review internal Production Support Flight process
performance and feedback to determine the correct metrics for providing accurate feedback for
focused and effective process improvement. Selected measures must accurately reflect the status
of critical indicators of success. Subsequent to determining the correct metrics for providing
accurate feedback, the P&A will identify the source(s) for the information used to collect that
metrics. The P&A will then determine the parameters for acceptable Production Support Flight
performance within the selected metrics in accordance with Squadron Commander/Director
guidance. The P&A office will also monitor metrics driven by the Maintenance Group or Wing.

20.48. (Added) Evaluate Process and Procedures.

20.48.1. (Added) The P&A Unit will perform periodic review of procedures to verify they
support mission objectives. The results of these reviews will be reported to the Production
Support Flight Chief. As a result of internal review, the P&A Section will conduct trend
analyses, identify changes to policies and procedures, system changes, remedial training
requirements, measure performance deficiencies, as required.

Table A14.7. (Added) Inspection/Certification Codes
              INSPECTION/CERTIFICATION CODES (For ALCs only)

The codes identified below are the only inspection/certification codes authorized for use on
depot maintenance WCDs. Any maintenance personnel that certify depot maintenance
WCDs will stamp and date each required certification. Stamp impression must be legible and
will not obliterate any other stamp impression already applied to the document. Only stamps
issued by the applicable organization Stamp Monitor will be used for the certification of
depot maintenance WCDs.

NOTE: On tasks/operations where secondary certification has been determined the “E” code
is used when technical data conformance “can” be verified after work completion. The “I”
code is the most critical of all inspection/certification codes and shall not be skipped over to
perform another dependent operation. The “I” code is used when technical data conformance
“cannot” be verified after work completion.

Table A14.11. (Added) Information Systems Interfacing
                   INFORMATION SYSTEMS INTERFACING

Personnel operating within the repair process use numerous DoD and USAF legacy systems.
Specific legacy system descriptions are:

CAVAF: COMMERCIAL ASSET VISIBILITY - AIR FORCE (CAVAF) provides visibility
of assets at commercial contractor facilities, status reporting and capability to process
transactions received from asset management subsystem. The status transactions reported
are: receipt at a contractor's facility, induction into repair, completion of maintenance,
shipment, not economically reparable, request for disposition instructions, scrap transaction,
and disposition of non-reparable assets, and visibility of NWRM assets. The system uses a
standard 180 days for turnaround at a contractor's facility, from the date of induction. There
is no provision for reflecting the contractual due date, nor for projecting changes in shipping
dates.

MABSM: IMPRESSA system (MABSM) is a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) Enterprise
Resource Planning (ERP) system that includes a Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO)
module which integrates with Manufacturing and Financial applications. It provides users
with access to enterprise-wide information and utilizes a web-based user interface. MABSM
is used primarily to manage maintenance functions within the 309 Maintenance Wing at OO-
ALC/Hill Air Force Base, Utah. It is currently used to support the 309 Commodities
Management Group CMXG/CL consisting of Power Systems, Hydraulics, Landing Gear,
New Tech Repair and MMXG/CC Missiles group. The software system name is IMPRESA
and the software release is 7.30.10. The database configuration is Oracle 11.1.0.7 64 bit
(11g). The hardware platform is HP Proliant DL585. The operating system is Red Hat
Enterprise/Linux AS (64 bit). The hardware is located and managed at Hill Air Force Base,
Utah within the IT organization. The system is CAC enabled with single sign-on (SSO)
capability. Access to the system is granted via account/password only when a form
DD2875/SAAR has been approved and processed. Users at locations outside of the Hill2K
domain can access the system with proper security and firewall access approvals. The system
is capable of enforcing report and form level security for government approved vendors,
typically used for vendors working on site at a HAFB location.

D002A: INTEGRATED LOGISTICS SYSTEM – SUPPLY (ILS-S) provides Joint
Command and Air Force warfighters with global visibility of base-level weapon system parts,
and other supply assets for planning and accomplishing real-time combat operations world-
wide. It is comprised of the following supply applications: Standard Base Supply System
(SBSS), Standard Asset Tracking System (SATS), Air Force Supply Centralized Database
306                                           AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012


(AFSCDB), and Enterprise Solution Supply (ESS). ILS-S supports 15,000 plus supply
customers and is an integral part of Air Force Supply Chain Management and Chief Financial
Officer financial accounting. ILS-S provides direct supply support to Active, Guard, and
Reserve forces anywhere in the world in support of peacetime and wartime operations. ILS-S
is a Non ACAT, Mission Assurance Category I (MAC I) sustainment program. It is
scheduled to be replaced by the Expeditionary Combat Support System (ECSS) in FY12. In
the interim, the ILS-S applications identified above will be maintained as necessary to ensure
continued supply support to the war fighter.

D035A: ITEM MANAGER WHOLESALE REQUISITION PROCESS (IMWRP) provides
a uniform item management capability for worldwide property accounting, inventory control,
and distribution/redistribution of material at the wholesale level. Requisitions and related
transactions are processed in support of AF bases, security assistance program, other
services/agencies, contractors and depot supply. Document control is maintained to ensure
that the customer requisition is fully satisfied. Balances are adjusted as a result of
redistribution orders, material release orders, capitalization/recapitalization actions and
logistics transfer actions. Reports of excess are processed on consumable, equipment and
recoverable items.

D035B: WHOLESALE MANAGEMENT AND EFFICIENCY REPORTS (WMER)
provides transaction history data and management data products for AF managed material.
Produces logistics performance information, supply availability and workload analysis
reports, indicating supply effectiveness relative to demands placed on the USAF Logistics
System. Measures the AFMC requisitioning pipeline, by segment, against Department of
Defense (DoD) time standards from date of requisition to date materiel is available for
shipment. Provides management with performance data at various levels throughout AFMC
and HQ USAF.

D035C: REPORTABLE ASSET MANAGEMENT PROCESS (RAMP) has been formally
decommissioned, however the Data Systems Designator (DSD) name is retained to represent
RAMP functionality in D035 within CDRS, only. RAMP receives and summarizes
transactions indicating materiel usage, providing base repair cycle time and usage data for the
recoverable consumption item requirements system. Maintains visibility of AF-owned
recoverable assets and levels by reporting location, and provides visibility of reparable items
in transit between operating accounts until a receipt has been acknowledged by the
accountable receiving activity.

D035E: READINESS BASED LEVELING (RBL) is being used for Interface Control
Document (ICD) purposes to document RBL specific interfaces of D035 within CDRS only.
RBL computes users' stock levels for selected recoverable items and provides the levels to the
recorded users. When received, the levels are loaded and used in the requisitioning process.

D035J: FINANCIAL INVENTORY ACCOUNTING AND BILLING SYSTEM (FIABS)
provides financial recording for the accountable item inventory balance of AF investment
items and items in the general support, system support, and reparable support divisions of the
AF stock fund. Reflects the dollar status of stock fund general ledger.

D035K: WHOLESALE AND RETAIL RECEIVING AND SHIPPING (WARRS) is a
legacy mainframe D035 subsystem that provides retail customer support including bit-and-
piece parts and end-item support to depot maintenance. Maintains historical data for all
accountable depot retail transactions and for Air Force receipts into the depot and for
shipments out of the depot.

D087X: EXECUTION AND PRIORITIZATION OF REPAIRS SUPPORT SYSTEM
(EXPRESS) provides a single ALC integrated priority list of all repair requirements,
determining ability of existing resources to support repair actions, and providing the data and
mechanism to move items into repair. Prioritization of Aircraft Reparables (PARS)
prioritizes repair and distribution of assets to the users from the source of the consolidated
serviceable inventory (CSI). EXPRESS Prioritization Processor (EPP) sets priorities for the
repair of items which are not addressed in PARs and combines all into a single integrated list
for each repair shop. Assets which do not have aircraft availability goals are prioritized using
a deepest-hole logic to try to fill the most critical need. EPP provides list to the Distribution
Module to identify prepositioning actions for serviceable parts as they come out of repair.
The Supportability Module takes the EPP list and determines whether the required items can
be repaired based on 4 evaluation criteria availability: carcass, repair parts, repair funds, and
repair resources. Items meeting all criteria are entered onto the D035K EXPRESS Table for
transfer to the shop.

D200A: REQUIREMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (RMS) computes procurement
requirements for spares and determines depot level maintenance repair needs for the Air
Force. RMS forecasts and controls procurement and repair requirements of materiel needed
for logistics support of weapon systems operated by the Air Force. RMS maintains visibility
on all recoverable and consumable spares while computing buy and repair requirements on a
quarterly cycle and contains a Central Secondary Item Stratification process which compares
peacetime and war readiness assets against requirements for Air Force recoverable and
consumable items and produces the Supply System Inventory Report (SSIR), an annual
report to Congress on the status of Department of Defense (DoD) on-hand inventory at the
end of each fiscal year. RECOVERABLE ITEM SIMULATION CAPABILITY (RISC)
provides the ability to re-compute selected recoverable consumption items (simulation of
D200A).

D230: MATERIEL PROCESSING SYSTEM (MPS) enables mechanics to automatically
request material on the shop floor, immediately notifies the planner for approval, and
provides the ability for Production Material Technicians/Forward Logistics Specialists to
review the status of all orders placed, as well as correct and process orders with error
conditions returned. MPS is intricately tied to the schedule execution and PDM workload
management system for aircraft and missiles, and performs material planner support for
commodities.

G004L: JOB ORDER PRODUCTION MASTER SYSTEM (JOPMS) initiates and manages
the Job Order Number (JON) which is required to begin a maintenance task on the shop floor.
The system creates and tracks work in progress, interfaces with financial systems providing

visibility of production hours in process and completed (earned hours), provides a repository
for storing the production number master records, tracks customer work requests, record
work authorizations, maintain temporary work plans, records end item production, and
documents standard labor hours earned during depot level maintenance.

G005M: DEPOT MAINTENANCE MATERIEL SUPPORT SYSTEM (DMMSS) identifies
material that must be pre-positioned to support maintenance workloads and manages the
BOM, which is required for planning for material in support of production maintenance
workloads, initiating costing for the depot maintenance systems, and providing a mechanism
to control material usage.

G019C: MISTR REQUIREMENTS SCHEDULING AND ANALYSIS SYSTEM - MISTR
provides maintenance with scheduling and analysis data on Management Items Subject to
Repair (MISTR) reparable items. Schedules and tracks MISTR items and provides
management information necessary to respond to the turn-around required by the repair
cycle. The system also produces MISTR schedules that are distributed to maintenance for
scheduling repair operations by individual stock number and control number.

G037F: WORKLOAD ANALYSIS PLANNING DATA SYSTEM (WAPDS) is now an
OC-ALC site unique that generates MDS input/output schedules and workload analysis
reports for aircraft (LA) and financial (FM) organizations. The maximum quantities in work,
monthly input quantities, and learning curves in order to compute aircraft input internal. In
addition, a method is provided to summarize the skill and labor standards received from
projections of critical path data. The summarized standard data is applied to the input/output
schedule producing a graphic representation of the scheduled workload and a computation of
monthly work requirements. The requirements are stated in both standard man-hours and
personnel equivalents. The system objective is to support the workload analysis process with
computer prepared reports and graphics giving optimized input/output schedules, estimated
labor standards, critical path facility usage, workload analysis for planned labor applications,
and historical analysis.

G081: MALFUNCTION DETECTION, ANALYSIS & RECORDING SYSTEM/GRD
PROC SYSTEM (MADARS) provides in-flight aircraft status and troubleshooting info while
generating a permanent record of LRU status. MADARS shows current performance of
selected systems, performs engine health diagnosis, identifies discrepant LRUs, records trend
data, determines its own health, calibrates the total monitoring system and provides for data
storage and retrieval. A GRD computer system processes in-flight data recorded on tapes,
evaluates the trend data, and develops programs to utilize the experience data. System
supports base level and logistics for the C-5A/B, C-141, C-17 at AMC bases, Air Force
Reserve (AFR) bases and Air National Guard (ANG) bases.

G097: PROGRAMMED DEPOT MAINTENANCE SCHEDULING SYSTEM (PDMSS) is
the AFMC depots standard project management system used to manage execution of all
aircraft programmed/unprogrammed depot maintenance and overhaul workload performed
for the warfighter. PDMSS performs planning, maintenance operation resourcing and
completion, critical path schedule execution, and performance management and is the critical

workload management system for aircraft and missile planners, schedulers, and maintenance
technicians.

G337: INVENTORY TRACKING SYSTEM (ITS) tracks repairable end items from time of
induction into the depot to time of turn-in. It provides inventory control and assigns item
tracking numbers to all parts as they come in and subsequently tracks them through
disassembly, repair, and assembly.

G402A: EXCHANGEABLES PRODUCTION SYSTEM (EPS) links the maintenance shop
floor personnel to Depot Supply for ordering and issuing direct and indirect material, and
track maintenance transactions in process. It also provides visibility of workload
requirements and end item asset availability. Users of the system are maintenance personnel,
planners, schedulers, and cost analysis personnel.

J025A: AUTOMATED PROJECT ORDER FORM SYSTEM (APO) automates the AFMC
181 process/coordination and provides an automated routing control for the next in line
process step. Emphasis of the system is to provide access for the status of documents as
approved, rejected, or canceled; for extraction of summarization data; access to historical data
and reports.

Chapter 1 - MANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY AND POLICY

1.4. Maintenance Concept. The AF requires varying degrees of maintenance capability at
different locations. Maintenance capability depends upon mission requirements, force
protection, economics of repair, transportation limitations, component reliability, workload
agreements, facility requirements, frequency of tasks, and special training required. This
capability is described (in order of increasing capability) as either organizational, intermediate,
or depot.

1.4.2. (Added) Organizational - First level of maintenance performed on-equipment (directly on
aircraft or support equipment) at flightline level. This level generally includes repair, inspection,
testing, servicing and/or calibration. Organizational level maintenance is part of the MGN.

1.4.3. (Added) Intermediate - Second level of maintenance performed off-equipment (on
removed component parts or equipment) at backshop level. Primarily testing and repair or
replacement of component parts. This level also includes Centralized Repair Facilities (CRFs).
Intermediate level maintenance is part of the RN. Refer to 1.4.6.

1.4.4. (Added) Depot - Third level of maintenance performed on- or off-equipment at a major
repair facility. Highest level of maintenance for more complex repairs. Depot level maintenance
is part of the RN. Refer to 1.4.6.

1.4.5. (Added) Standard maintenance units and operational test units that possess non-
traditional aircraft maintenance Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSC) such as 3DXXX,
Communications/Electronics Systems career field, who perform maintenance on aircraft or
aircraft support systems, must comply with the requirements identified within this instruction. In
the event of a conflict with other guidance, this instruction will take precedence.
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012                                               311



 1.4.6. (Added) Repair Network. The MXGs shall support the development and implementation
of the Repair Network Integration (RNI). The Air Force Repair Network is organized into four
hierarchal levels; repair enterprise, product repair groups, repair networks and repair nodes. A
repair network is a collection of repair nodes within product repair groups that support the repair
enterprise. The management of the repair network is comprised of the Repair Network Manager
(RNM) (who may reside in the ALC ASD organization) whose role is to oversee and manage a
collection of repair nodes within a specific product repair group. Node Managers will reside
within the MXG’s for all maintenance managed within the wings.

1.4.6.1. (Added) Repair Node. The Air Force Repair Node level is an individual organizational
unit within repair network(s). The role of the Node Manager is to oversee and manage all shop
activities pertaining to a specific Repair Node. The Node Manager shall:

1.4.6.1.1. (Added) Collect Repair Node Capability and Capacity (CAP2) data. The Node
Manager will also develop Production Plans to support RNM Workload Plans. The Production
Plan shall be provided to the RNM annually and when adjustments are made to the current plan.
The Node Manager will provide the RNM with updates to CAP2 IAW workload allocation plans
and ensure data accuracy.

1.4.6.1.2. (Added) Manage Repair Node operations to support approved performance goals.
The Node Manager shall adjust Repair Node operations as required to meet performance goals.
The Node Manager will communicate production deviations which exceed agreed upon upper or
lower limits to RNM and chain-of-command. The Node Manager will provide mitigation
strategy to address negative performance deviations. The Node Manager will communicate
technical requirement changes via established processes to RNM and engineering as they
become known.

1.4.6.1.3. (Added) Execute Shaping and Sizing actions as defined in the approved Network
Shaping and Sizing Plan as approved by the governance structure. (Shaping and Sizing is a
process for recommending a rational structuring of the Air Force's capability and capacity
(manpower and infrastructure) to ensure an appropriate amount exists based on current and
future mission objectives.)

1.4.6.1.4. (Added) Ensure squadron/group/wing leadership has access to and/or is aware of all
communication exchanges with MAJCOMs and RNMs with regard to RNI processes, CAP2 data
inputs and workload allocation changes/plans.

1.4.6.1.5. (Added) Participate in CPI activities, and share results with RNM.

1.8. Waiver Request. The Wing Commander/Director or Deputy, or equivalent will coordinate
on waiver requests to this instruction. Send waiver requests to
afmc.a4.workflow@wpafb.af.mil (AFMC/A4 Workflow) or mail to HQ AFMC/A4, 4375
Chidlaw Rd, Bldg 262 WPAFB OH 45433-5006.

1.10. Performance–Based Activities. Additional guidance on contract surveillance is
provided in Chapter 18 to this instruction. Units will identify mission essential services and
develop the necessary documents in accordance with DoDI 3020.37, Continuation of Essential
DoD Contractor Services During Crisis.

1.10.2.5. (Added) AFMC/PK and AFMC/A4M will designate focal points for organizational,
functional, and technical questions pertaining to each performance-based activity program. For
HPO designated functions, the Functional Director/Commander (FD/FC) is normally the
commander having overall responsibility for the maintenance function. As such, the FD/FC is
the designated focal point for all organizational and functional questions pertaining to each HPO.

1.10.3. (Added) Developing Performance-Based Requirements Documents. Performance-based
requirements documents (e.g., Statement of Objectives, Statement of Work, Performance Work
Statements) focus on desired outcomes and performance standards that communicate what the
contractor is asked to provide. Requirements documents provide desired outcomes, performance
standards, milestones (if appropriate), and metrics which not only measure the contractor's
performance but reflect the management imperatives and initiatives that drive the AF (e.g.,
Mission Capable Rate) and other key efficiency and effectiveness metrics. Requirements
documents do not provide "how to" details that dictate the contractor's organization,
management, personnel development, or approach to completing work. The only exceptions are
safety, environmental management, and security when the contractor operates on a military
installation. Additionally, the contractor is required to follow applicable TOs when performing
maintenance. Unlike MEO and HPO, contractor operations and personnel are not supervised by
government personnel. Any changes to the scope of the work shall be reflected in an official
change to the requirements document, which is provided to the contracting officer for modifi-
cation of the contract.

DEV 1.12. Maintenance Information Systems (MIS). CPSD is authorized to utilize local
systems to satisfy the requirements of paragraph 1.12.

1.13. Communications. An authorized communication system must be selected with the
capability to effectively support the maintenance communication requirements, including
mobility and host base interoperability IAW AFI 33-202, Network and Computer Security.
Wireless LANs (WLANs) must comply with all applicable AF 33-series publications. Radios
shall be frequency-programmable. (Applicable to CPSD unless restricted by security guidance.)

1.13.1.1. (Added) Use of personal cell phone or communication devices is authorized in the
industrial/production areas except while performing hands-on maintenance activities. Employ-
ees will remove themselves from any maintenance activity, aircraft, or high traffic areas prior to
using a communication device.

1.13.1.2. (Added) Use of portable music/video players (boom boxes, stereos and other sizable
devices), electronic games or other personal electronic hearing impairing devices is authorized in
industrial production areas except where audio warning cues are used.
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                26 APRIL 2012                                              313


1.13.1.3. (Added) Contractor issued electronic and communication devices will follow the same
guidance as official government issued electronic and communication devices.

1.13.2. (Added) MXG/CC, Civilian Leader (CL), Civilian Director (CD), or equivalent must
develop communication plans IAW AFI 21-101 showing current needs, how they are satisfied,
and the maintenance programming for future needs.

 1.22. (Added) Maintenance Management Metrics. Metrics provide a measurement of
performance and capability. Leaders, supervisors and technicians must have accurate and
reliable information to make decisions. Primary concerns of maintenance managers are how
well the unit is meeting mission requirements, how to improve equipment performance,
identifying emerging support problems, and projecting future trends. Maintenance management
metrics—sometimes called “health of fleet” indicators—are a crucial form of information used
by maintenance leaders to improve the performance of maintenance organizations, equipment
and people when compared with established goals and standards. Metrics often take the form of
an “MC Rate” line chart or a “Dashboard” presenting a gauge of an organization’s effectiveness
and efficiency. Properly used, metrics create a roadmap that helps determine where the unit has
been, where the unit should be, and how the unit will get there.

1.22.1. (Added) The overarching objective of AF maintenance is to maintain aircraft and
equipment in a safe, serviceable and ready condition to meet mission needs. Maintenance
management metrics serve this overarching objective and shall be established or maintained by
Headquarters AF, Major Commands, Wings and/or Squadrons to evaluate/improve equipment
condition, personnel skills and long-term fleet health. Metrics shall be used at all levels of
command to drive improved performance and adhere to well-established guidelines. Metrics
must be:

1.22.1.1. (Added) Accurate and useful for decision-making.

1.22.1.2. (Added) Consistent and clearly linked to goals/standards.

1.22.1.3. ( Added-AFMC) Clearly understood and communicated.

1.22.1.4. (Added) Based on a measurable, well-defined process.

1.22.2. (Added) Analysis is crucial to improving organizational performance and is the key
component of the metrics management process. Commanders and maintenance managers must
properly evaluate maintenance metrics and rely upon the maintenance analysis section for
unbiased information. Analysis sections shall draw upon information from various maintenance
information systems for data. The Integrated Maintenance Data System-Central Database
(IMDS-CDB), G081 (CAMS for Mobility), Reliability and Maintainability Information System
(REMIS), Standard Base Supply System (SBSS), AF Knowledge Services (AFKS), Combat
Ammunition System (CAS), and AF/A4-approved command-unique analysis tools are the
primary data sources. A good maintenance manager does not manage the metrics, but rather
uses metrics to focus resources and personnel to improve maintenance processes. Managers
must also clearly understand and communicate the crucial linkage between goals, standards and
314                                           AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012


metrics. The AF sets goals and standards for organizations, personnel and weapons systems that
facilitate evaluation, comparisons and improvements. These standards are published separately
by senior leadership and should be clearly understood at all levels of command. Leaders at every
level must also support analysis and review metrics to properly drive improved performance.
Maintenance analysts manage and track this process, but maintenance metrics, and the resulting
improvements they drive, are inherently a leadership responsibility.

1.22.3. (Added) AFMC Test Wing maintenance metric focus. Due to the unpredictable nature
of the test environment, normal fleet availability and program execution indicators may not
portray the most accurate picture of the health of the test fleet. Although the traditional
maintenance metrics (MC Rate, Break Rate, etc) arm the maintenance leader with information
needed to help effectively manage maintenance resources, the focus of AFMC’s test wing
maintenance differs somewhat from an operational wing. Therefore, AFMC’s focus shifts from
the MC Rate, to areas where AFMC’s maintenance units have the most control – scheduled
maintenance and deviations from the flying and test schedule. The key measurements of how
well the maintenance unit manages scheduled and unscheduled maintenance are listed here:

1.22.3.1. (Added) Test Schedule Effectiveness (TSE) Rate. Similar to the Flying Schedule
Effectiveness for the CAF, TSE is a leading indicator and is a measure of how well the unit
planned and executed the weekly flying and ground test event schedule. TSE is derived by
comparing each day’s deviations to the flying and ground test schedule. Deviations that decrease
the TSE from 100 percent include: scheduled sorties/ground test events not accomplished
because of maintenance, supply, operations, weather, HHQ, air traffic control, sympathy, or
other reasons; scheduled events that actually start more than 30 minutes prior to scheduled start
time; scheduled events that begin more than 15 minutes after their scheduled start time and
events that are added to the schedule. Disruptions to the flying or ground test schedule, or
constant configuration changes to test assets can cause turmoil on the flightline, send a ripple
effect throughout other agencies, and adversely impact scheduled maintenance actions.

1.22.3.1.1. (Added)
TSE (%) = Total Ground and Sortie Events Scheduled – Total Deviations x 100
                    Total Ground and Sortie Events Scheduled

1.22.3.2. (Added) Maintenance Deviation Rate (MX Dev). Although all deviations to the test
schedule are counted in the TSE calculation, the Maintenance Deviation Rate represents
deviations to the flying/ground test schedule that are, for the most part, are within the
maintenance community’s control. All maintenance late take offs, ground aborts, cancellations,
and maintenance additions are counted towards the rate. Although all deviations from the
published schedule can cause turmoil on the flightline, maintenance supervision should focus on
eliminating or minimizing schedule deviations due to maintenance.

1.22.3.2.1. (Added)
Maint Dev Rate (%) =         Total Maintenance Deviations                 x 100
                       Total Ground and Sortie Events Scheduled
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                26 APRIL 2012                                              315


1.22.3.3. (Added) Scheduling Effectiveness for Maintenance (SEM). SEM is a primary focus
for AFMC. It measures the overall efficiency and effectiveness of scheduled maintenance, as
well as the unit’s effectiveness in responding to unscheduled maintenance. SEM helps identify
turmoil in meeting the wing’s test requirements. It is a weighted combination of a unit’s Total
Scheduling Effectiveness for Maintenance and Maintenance Scheduling Effectiveness rates, both
explained below. SEM includes total scheduled test events, both flight and ground. The unit
should focus on completing scheduled maintenance events, as scheduled, including
documentation, as well as minimizing maintenance deviations to the test schedule.

1.22.3.3.1. (Added) SEM (%) =        [(TSEM % x 10) x 0.7) + (MSE % x 10) x 0.3)]
                                                         10

1.22.3.4. (Added) Maintenance Scheduling Effectiveness (MSE). This is a leading indicator
that measures success in the unit’s ability to plan and complete inspections and periodic
maintenance, including documentation, on-time per the maintenance plan. Deviations to the plan
are recorded. A low MSE rate may indicate a unit is experiencing turbulence on the flightline or
in the back shops. This indicator is primarily used as feedback to maintenance managers on the
success and adherence to scheduled maintenance plans and actions. To compute the MSE, you
must know the number of maintenance actions scheduled and accomplished as scheduled along
with each action’s weighted value (based on the importance of the event and established by
MAJCOM directives).

1.22.3.4.1. (Added) MSE (%) =        Total Points Earned x 100
                                     Total Points Possible

1.22.3.5. (Added) Total Scheduling Effectiveness for Maintenance (TSEM) – TSEM is another
focus area for AFMC’s flightline maintenance community. TSEM measures the effect of
maintenance deviations on the test schedule. The TSEM rate only considers schedule deviations
caused by the maintenance complex.

1.22.3.5.1. (Added)
TSEM (%) = Total Gnd and Sortie Events Sched – Total MX Devs              x 100
                    Total Gnd and Sortie Events Sched

1.22.4. (Added) Traditional Maintenance Metrics. Metrics are often grouped into various
categories, including leading or lagging indicators. Leading indicators show a problem first, as
they directly impact maintenance’s capability to provide resources to execute the mission.
Lagging indicators follow and show firmly established trends. Maintenance leaders must review
sortie production and maintenance health of fleet indicators constantly and be knowledgeable
about maintenance indicators that highlight trends before they become limiting factors. This
section lists the primary maintenance metrics alphabetically with a description and the formula
for the metric. Referenced Maintenance Status Codes are found in AFI 21-103, Equipment
Inventory, Status and Utilization Reporting, Attachment 2; Flying Codes are found in TO 00-20-
2, Maintenance Data Documentation, Appendix L. CPSD will develop procedures for local
metrics.

1.22.4.1. (Added) Aircraft Possession. A key factor in metrics involves aircraft “possession.”
The AF mandates each aircraft will always be owned or “possessed” by a designated
organization. Possession is an indicator of an organization’s or aircraft fleet’s health. Aircraft
that are under the control of their owning base are possessed by that organization. An aircraft
that flies to depot for maintenance/inspection or is repaired by a depot team at the base is
temporarily possessed by depot. In calculating the various aircraft maintenance metrics,
possession is calculated in units of hours normally for specific time periods (e.g., monthly,
annual).

1.22.4.2. (Added) (Total) Abort Rate (AR). A unit’s abort rate is a leading indicator of both
aircraft reliability and quality of maintenance performed. It is the percentage of test events
(flown and ground) aborted in the air and on the ground. An abort is a test event that ends
prematurely and must be re-accomplished. The abort rate may be measured separately as ground
or air aborts. Abbreviations are: GA = Ground Aborts; AA = Air Aborts; and NTI = Non-Test
Induced

1.22.4.2.1. (Added)
Total AR (%) =      # Maint GA (NTI) + # AA (NTI)                   x 100
                   Total Sorties Flown + Ground Aborts

1.22.4.3. (Added) Aircraft availability. Percentage of a fleet not in a Depot possessed status or
NMC aircraft (that are unit possessed). NOTE: The metric may be created at the Mission
Design (MD)/MDS level or may be grouped by fleet (e.g., Aggregate, Bombers, Fighters) to
determine “Aircraft Availability”.

1.22.4.3.1. (Added) Availability rate =     MC hours*                x 100
                                      Total Possessed hours**

(Added) 1. * MC Hours consists of Possession Purpose Codes (PPC): CA, CB, CC, CF, EH, EI,
IF, PJ, PL, PR, TF, TJ, ZA, and ZB.

(Added) 2. ** Total Possessed Hours (TAH) consist of the following PPC: BJ, BK, BL, BN,
BO, BQ, BR, BT, BU, BW, BX, CA, CB, CC, CF, EH, EI, DJ, DK, DL, DM, DO, DR, IF, PJ,
PL, PR, TF, TJ, XW, XZ, ZA, and ZB

1.22.4.4. (Added) Break Rate (BR). The break rate is a leading, flying-related metric. It is the
percentage of aircraft that land in “Code-3” or “Alpha-3” for Mobility AF (MAF), status. This
metric primarily indicates aircraft system reliability. It may also reflect the quality of aircraft
maintenance performed. If Fix Rates (refer to paragraph 1.15.4.8.) are used as a measurement of
maintainability, the Break Rate is the complementary measurement of reliability. For true
evaluation of equipment/system reliability, measurements must be taken at the system/subsystem
level. It is also an excellent predictor of parts demand. Several indicators that follow break rate
are Mission Capable (MC), Total Not Mission Capable for Supply (TNMCS), Cannibalization
Rate (CR) and Repeat/Recur (R/R).

1.22.4.4.1. (Added) BR (%) =           Number of Sorties that Land “Code-3”          x 100
                                              Total Sorties Flown

1.22.4.5. (Added) Cannibalization Rate (CR). The CR is a leading indicator that reflects the
number of cannibalization (CANN) actions (removal of a serviceable part from an aircraft or
engine to replace an unserviceable part on another aircraft or engine or to fill an Readiness
Spares Package (RSP)). In most cases, a cannibalization action takes place when the Logistics
Readiness Squadron (LRS) cannot deliver the part when needed and mission requirements
demand the aircraft be returned to an MC status. The CR is the number of cannibalization
actions per total sorties flown. This rate includes all aircraft-to-aircraft, engine-to-aircraft, and
aircraft/engine to RSP cannibalization actions. Since LRS relies on the back shops and depot for
replenishment, this indicator can also be used, in part, to indicate back shop and depot support.

1.22.4.5.1. (Added) CR (%) = Number of Aircraft and Engine CANNs                     x 100
                                        Sorties Flown

1.22.4.6. (Added) Deferred (or Delayed) Discrepancy (DD) Rate (DDR). The DDR is a leading
indicator that should be closely evaluated in comparison to other metrics. This rate represents
the average deferred discrepancies across the unit's average possessed aircraft fleet.
Discrepancies are considered deferred when: a) they are discovered and the decision is made to
defer them, b) discrepancies are scheduled with a start date greater than 5 calendar days after the
discovery date, or c) discrepancies are awaiting parts with a valid off base requisition. Delayed
discrepancies may be Awaiting Maintenance (AWM) or Awaiting Parts (AWP). Although
minor maintenance actions must sometimes be deferred or delayed to a more opportune time,
maintenance should try to keep this rate as low as possible. If delayed discrepancies can’t be
scheduled/combined with a more extensive maintenance action, maintenance schedulers should
routinely schedule their aircraft down for a day when required to work deferred discrepancies.
The DDR metric measures AWM + AWP rates, though individual AWM and AWP rates can and
should also be monitored.

1.22.4.6.1. (Added) Total DDR (%) = Total (Snapshot) AWM + AWP Discrepancies
                                           Average Aircraft Possessed

1.22.4.6.2. (Added) AWM DDR (%) = Total (Snapshot) AWM Discrepancies
                                      Average Aircraft Possessed

1.22.4.6.3. (Added) AWP DDR (%) = Total (Snapshot) AWP Discrepancies
                                       Average Aircraft Possessed

1.22.4.7. (Added) Departure (Logistics) Reliability (DR) Rate (DRR). This is a leading metric
used primarily by the MAF to show a composite of supply, airfield saturation or maintenance
problems. The on-time standard for departures are those within 15 minutes of the daily
scheduled departure time. The metric provides the commander with an objective measure of the
health of the air mobility system and reflects the percentage of departures that are on-time. The
main focus of the departure reliability metric is to strengthen the air mobility system through
accountability for process improvement. This metric may also be subdivided into other
318                                            AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012


categories (e.g., worldwide departure or en route).

1.22.4.7.1. (Added)
DRR (%) = Number of Departures – Number of Logistics Delays x 100
                     Number of Departures

1.22.4.8. (Added) Fix Rate (FR). The FR is a leading indicator showing how well the repair
process is being managed. It is a percentage of aircraft with a landing status code of 3 (includes
system cap codes 3 and 4) returned to a flyable status in a certain amount of time (clock hours).
Refer to AFI 21-103 and MAJCOM directives for maintenance start time (e.g., engine shut
down, "first" chock). Problems found by maintenance after the aircraft lands (ground found) are
not considered in the fix time. The fix time stops when all Landing Status Code 3 Pilot Reported
Discrepancies (PRDs) are fixed even if the aircraft remains NMC. This metric is an excellent
tool to track "dead time" in aircraft repair processes because it measures the speed of repair and
equipment maintainability. The common, standard interval for this metric is 12-hours. However,
fighter units typically measure fix rate at shorter intervals (4 and/or 8 hours) along with the 12-
hour rate.

1.22.4.8.1. (Added)
FR (%) = “Code-3” Breaks Fixed Within 12 Hours of Landing           x 100
                          Total “Code-3” Breaks

1.22.4.9. (Added) Hangar Queen (HQ) (Average) Rate. Refer to Chapter 14 of this instruction
for HQ categories/criteria. This indicator is used to evaluate management of the Hangar Queen
program and to assist units with problems beyond their control. The HQ rate captures the
average number of aircraft hangar queen days (all categories) for a specified reporting period.

1.22.4.9.1. (Added)
HQ (%) = Total Acft Days in all HQ Categories (in report period) x 100
                       Days (in report period)

1.22.4.10. (Added) Home-Station Logistics Departure Reliability (HSLDR) Rate. This is a
leading metric used primarily by the MAF for airlift aircraft. This delineates down to only first-
leg departures of unit-owned aircraft departing home station.

1.22.4.10.1. (Added)
HSLDR Rate (%) = # of HS Departures – # of HS Logistics Delays x 100
                            # of HS Departures

1.22.4.11. (Added) Isochronal Inspection (ISO) Rate. This leading metric measures the average
time until next major inspection remaining on the fleet. It should be approximately half the
inspection interval and should appear as a diagonal line when the fleet ISO average is portrayed
graphically in a Time-Distribution Interval (TDI) (e.g., “scatter gram”). An ISO TDI is a
product that shows hours remaining until the next phase inspection (PH) on each aircraft
possessed by a unit. However, a unit may have good reasons to manage its ISO flow so the data
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012                                              319


points define a pattern other than a diagonal line.

1.22.4.11.1. (Added) ISO Rate = Total Hours of All Possessed Aircraft Until Next ISO
                                          Total Possessed Aircraft Assigned

1.22.4.12. (Added) Mission Capable (MC) Rate. Though this is a lagging indicator, the MC
rate is perhaps the best-known yardstick for measuring a unit’s performance. It is the percentage
of possessed hours (excluding aircraft in “B-Type” possession purpose code/purpose identifier
code status: BJ, BK, BL, BN, BO, BQ, BR, BT, BU, BW, BX) for aircraft that are FMC or PMC
for specific measurement periods (e.g., monthly or annual). A low MC rate may indicate a unit
is experiencing many hard breaks, parts supportability shortfalls or workforce management
issues. Maintenance managers should look for workers deferring repairs to other shifts,
inexperienced workers, lack of parts from LRS, poor in-shop scheduling, high cannibalization
rates or training deficiencies. High commitment rates may also contribute to a lower MC rate.
The key is to focus on negative trends and identify systemic, underlying causes. Further, the root
factors of the MC rate should be measured, evaluated and reported through the use of the
TNMCM, TNMCS and NMCB rates.

1.22.4.12.1. (Added) MC (%) = FMC Hours + PMC Hours                 x 100
                                Possessed Hours

1.22.4.12.2. (Added) Total Not Mission Capable Maintenance (TNMCM) Rate. Though a
lagging indicator, the TNMCM rate is perhaps the most common and useful metric for
determining if maintenance is being performed quickly and accurately. It is the average
percentage of possessed aircraft (calculated monthly/annually) that are unable to meet primary
assigned missions for maintenance reasons (excluding aircraft in “B-Type” possession identifier
code status). Any aircraft that is unable to meet any of its wartime missions is considered Not
Mission Capable (NMC). The TNMCM is the amount of time aircraft are in NMCM plus Not
Mission Capable Both (NMCB) status. Maintenance managers should look for a relationship
between other metrics such as R/R, BR and FR to the TNMCM Rate. A strong correlation could
indicate heavy workloads (e.g., people are over tasked), poor management, training problems or
poor maintenance practices. The TNMCM is also called “out for maintenance.”

1.22.4.12.2.1. (Added) TNMCM (%) = NMCM Hrs + NMCB Hrs                      x 100
                                     Possessed Hours

1.22.4.12.3. (Added) Total Not Mission Capable Supply (TNMCS) Rate. Though this lagging
metric may seem a “LRS responsibility” because it is principally driven by availability of spare
parts, it is often directly indicative of maintenance practices. For instance, maintenance can keep
the rate lower by consolidating feasible cannibalization actions to as few aircraft as practical.
This monthly/annual metric is the average percentage of possessed aircraft that are unable to
meet primary missions for supply reasons. The TNMCS rate is the time aircraft are in NMCS
plus NMCB status. TNMCS is based on the number of airframes out for mission capable
(MICAP) parts that prevent the airframes from performing their mission (NMCS is not the
number of parts that are MICAP). Maintenance managers must closely monitor the relationship
between the Cannibalization Rate (CR) and TNMCS. TNMCS is also called "out for supply."

1.22.4.12.3.1. (Added) TNMCS (%) = NMCS Hrs + NMCB Hrs x 100
                                     Possessed Hours

1.22.4.13. (Added) Primary Aerospace Vehicle Authorized (PAA) vs. Possessed (P/P) Rate.
PAA are those aircraft authorized for a unit to perform their operational mission(s). It forms the
basis to allocate operating resources to include manpower, support equipment, and flying hour
funds. This metric shows a comparison of the unit’s PAA versus average possessed aircraft for a
particular time period. It identifies units below PAA so AFMC can assist in reallocating
resources to support contingency taskings or to reduce flying hour requirements. Reference AFI
16-402, Aerospace Vehicle Programming, Assignment, Distribution, Accounting, and
Termination.

1.22.4.13.1. (Added) P/P (%) = Average Number of Possessed Aircraft          x 100
                                     Total Unit Aircraft PAA

1.22.4.14. (Added) Personnel Availability (PA). Personnel availability simply provides a
measure of manning status. It compares the number of personnel authorized to the number of
personnel available. A maintenance manager may find it useful to review data based on skill
level. In which case, compare the personnel authorized to the number of personnel holding a
specific skill level. The number authorized is based on the Unit Manning Document. The
number available includes only those available for duty, which excludes those who are
reassigned, on leave, Temporary Duty (TDY), etc.

1.22.4.14.1. (Added) PA (%) = Total Number of Personnel Available            x 100
                            Total Number of Personnel Authorized

1.22.4.15. (Added) Phase Flow (PF) Average. This leading metric measures the average phase
time remaining on the fleet. It should be approximately half the inspection interval and should
appear as a diagonal line when the fleet PF average is portrayed graphically in a TDI. A phase
TDI is a product that shows hours remaining until the next phase on each aircraft possessed by a
unit. However, a unit may have good reasons to manage its phase flow so the data points define
a pattern other than a diagonal line. For example, in preparation for a long-distance overseas
deployment, a unit may need to build up the average phase time (average fleet time) remaining
on its fleet, because phase capability may be limited for a short time. Beware of gaps or
groupings, especially on aircraft with less than half the time remaining to phase.

1.22.4.15.1. (Added) PF = Total Hours of All Possessed Aircraft Until Next Phase
                                    Total Possessed Aircraft Assigned

1.22.4.16. (Added) Repair Cycle Processing (RCP) Total Time/Rate. Though primarily
considered a “supply-related metric,” this indicator can be an excellent local management tool.
It is the average time expressed in days that an unserviceable asset spends in the repair cycle at a
unit. This indicator is for repairable aircraft parts only; it does not include engines or support
equipment. The clock begins when the replacement part is issued to the flightline and ends when
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012                                                 321


the serviceable asset is returned from the repair facility to the parts store for reissue. To improve
the process of repairing parts, the different steps in that process must be measured.

1.22.4.16.1. (Added)
RCP (%) = (Pre-Mx + Repair + Post-Mx Days) – AWP Days                 x 100
                     Number of Items Turned In

1.22.4.17. (Added) Repeat/Recurring (R/R) Discrepancy Rate. This metric is a leading
indicator and perhaps the most important and accurate measure of the unit's maintenance quality.
It is the average number of repeat and recur system malfunctions compared to the total number
of aircrew reported discrepancies. A repeat discrepancy is when the same malfunction occurs in
a system/subsystem on the next sortie/sortie attempt after the discrepancy originally occurred and
was cleared by maintenance (including CNDs/no-defect-noted, etc). A recurring discrepancy is
when the same system/subsystem malfunction occurs on the 2nd thru 4th flights/attempted
flights after the original flight in which the malfunction occurred and was cleared by
maintenance (including CNDs/ no-defect-noted, etc). A high R/R rate may indicate lack of
thorough troubleshooting; inordinate pressure to commit aircraft to the flying schedule for
subsequent sorties; or a lack of experienced, qualified or trained technicians. The more complex
the weapon system and the greater the operations tempo, the more susceptible a unit is for repeat
or recurring discrepancies. Examine each R/R discrepancy and seek root causes and fixes. The
goal should be to keep all repeat and recurring discrepancies to a minimum.

1.22.4.17.1. (Added) R/R (%) =        Total Repeats + Total Recurs            x 100
                                    Total Pilot Reported Discrepancies

1.22.4.18. (Added) Upgrade Training (UT) Rate. This metric reflects the percentage of
technicians in upgrade training. The goal should be to keep the combined total less than 40
percent because the higher the number, the greater the training burden. Training should be given
high priority, as the number of personnel in training (and more importantly, the quality of the
maintenance training program) invariably affects other aircraft metrics (e.g., R/R or FR) in ways
that may not be immediately obvious.

1.22.4.18.1. (Added) UT (%) = Number of Technicians in Upgrade Training               x 100
                                  Total Number of Technicians

1.22.4.19. (Added) Utilization (UTE) Rate. The UTE rate is a leading indicator, but serves as a
yardstick for how well the maintenance organization supports the unit’s mission. The UTE rate
is the average number of sorties or hours flown per Primary Aerospace vehicle Authorized
(PAA) per month as found in the HAF/A3O PB documents. This measurement is primarily used
by operations in planning the unit's flying hour program. Maintenance uses this measurement to
show usage of assigned aircraft. Since UTE rates are used for planning, actual UTE rates
(computed at the end of the month) are used to evaluate the unit's monthly accomplishment
against the annual plan. Typically, Combat AF (CAF) units measure the sortie UTE rate, while
MAF units measure the hourly UTE rate to more accurately measure the combined performance
of operations and maintenance.

1.22.4.19.1. (Added) UTE Rate =       Sorties (or hours) Flown per Month
                                               PAA per Month

1.23. (Added) Support Agreements (SA). Maintenance organizations may be tasked to support
functions not related to the primary unit mission. Intra-service, inter-service, inter-command,
and international support agreements outline the degree of support provided and the
responsibilities of the supported function. The agreements must be developed and reviewed in
terms of possible impact on the primary unit mission and all other existing agreements and fully
coordinated with the LRS plans function.

1.23.1. (Added) The support agreement will also identify the manpower required to support the
workload as agreed upon by both organizations.

Chapter 2 - SAFETY

2.7.1. (Added) Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) officials, as
representatives of the Secretary of Labor, may conduct inspections of non military-unique
workplaces and operations where AF civilian personnel work. (The inspections may be
unannounced). OSHA inspectors may question or privately interview any employee, supervisory
employee, or official in charge of an operation or workplace.

2.7.2. (Added) Federal OSHA officials may perform OSH inspections of AF workplaces in
areas where the US holds exclusive federal jurisdiction (including government owned contractor
operated facilities).

2.7.3. (Added) State OSHA officials, operating under a federally approved plan and subject to
the terms of any variance, tolerance, or exemption granted by the Department of Labor, may
enforce state OSHA standards in contractor workplaces. At overseas location, local government
agencies may conduct inspections of AF operations where host nation personnel are employed or
contractor facilities or operations as stipulated in the status of forces or country-to-country
agreement IAW AFI 91-202.

2.10. AFOSHSTD 91-100 if applicable, equipment TOs, and local publications. See
Attachment 1 for AFOSHSTDs and AFIs applicable to all aircraft maintenance activities.

communication between QA and the squadrons, utilize the dedicated inspector system to the
maximum extent possible. Inspectors from QA are aligned with individual squadrons and
maintenance functions. Dedicated inspectors may continue to perform other QA duties;
however, their inspection activities focus on their assigned squadron/group. Although the
Dedicated Inspector System will be used, QA Chief will ensure rotation of these personnel IAW

paragraph 8.8 and 8.8.1 of this instruction and supplement.

8.3.27.2. (Added) QA Chief will ensure inspectors evaluate the maintenance and logistics
processes to ensure the right tools, equipment, technical orders, parts, requirements, etc. are on
hand and properly integrated into the overall maintenance and logistic processes.

8.3.28. (Added) As the selecting/hiring official for QA inspector/COR, QA Chief will ensure
the pre-requisites to fill QA inspector/COR is the individual must be highly qualified subject
matter expert (SME) in the functional area (i.e., avionics, AGE, aircraft maintenance, fabrication,
munitions, etc) for the functional area position the individual will be evaluating. The QA Chief
must ensure civilian QA inspector/COR civilians have the prior maintenance experience in the
functional area for which the position will be filled.

8.4.12.1. (Added) Review MSEP data monthly to identify high-missed items from evaluations,
inspections and observations.

8.4.13. (Added) Annually document the evaluation of the quality of maintenance training IAW
all applicable directives and TOs.

8.5.1.1. (Added) QA Inspectors/COR will conduct and document evaluations (PE, EPE),
inspections, and process reviews to include as a minimum the requirements in the MSEP.

8.5.1.2. (Added) Only munitions qualified inspectors with a 2W0 AFSC will inspect 2W0
maintenance tasks.

8.6. Quality Assurance Training. All CORs, inspectors and evaluators (i.e., QA personnel)
must be trained to the extent necessary to perform QA functions to include possessing sufficient
technical knowledge to effectively perform their duties.

8.6.1.1. (Added) Training must cover specific technical and weapons systems training
requirements.

8.6.1.2. (Added) Training must cover the evaluation and inspections of fundamental
maintenance and logistics programs such as: tools and equipment, technical orders, material
management, TMDE, forms documentation, FOD/DOP, safety and other programs found in the
Routine Inspection Listing.

8.6.1.3. (Added) Training must cover the evaluation and inspections of functional area(s) (i.e.
Avionics, AGE, PMEL, Munitions, etc.).

8.6.2. 1. QA inspectors (permanent and augmentee) require an annual EPE on a personnel
evaluation (PE) or a quality verification inspection (QVI).

8.6.5. Ensure requirements of TO 00-25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and Static
Grounding/Bonding and AFOSHSTD 91-5, Welding, Cutting and Brazing, are met before
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012                                               327


inspecting or evaluating aircraft welding operations.

8.6.10. (Added) Training Documentation. All QA personnel must be trained or possess
sufficient technical knowledge to effectively perform their duties. Employee training will be
tracked in the Educational and Training Management System (ETMS) or any other HQ
AFMC/A4 approved system. QA personnel are required to meet minimum qualifications on
certified task being assessed, and must meet any qualification (mandatory formal training)
requirements. The Maintenance Quality Manual or QAP will identify specific technical and/or
weapons systems training requirements.

8.8.1. (Added) Group QA Chief will analyze Quality Data and take measures to prevent
complacency and to ensure a “fresh look” at maintenance processes and maintenance discipline
in all areas and shifts of operations.

8.9. Activity Inspection Program. AFMC units with assigned Quality Assurance will establish
an activity inspection program. The MXW/MXG/CC/CL must ensure the depth and detail of the
activity inspection is sufficient to evaluate the management capability of the maintenance
organization. This can be achieved by expanding the minimum requirements outlined herein or
by adding special subject items. When conducting Activity Inspections, the team should use (but
are not limited to) the appropriate AF and MAJCOM LCAP and IG inspection checklists and
process improvement tools as the basis to evaluate and provide actionable feedback for unit
leadership. The team should evaluate the maintenance and logistics processes to ensure the right
tools, equipment, technical orders, parts, requirements, etc. are on hand and properly integrated
into the overall maintenance and logistic processes. Additionally, the activity inspection team
should address internal problems of the unit and those caused by other activities outside the
jurisdiction of the inspected unit. The MXW/MXG QA Chief recommends adjustments to the
requirements based on trends and problem areas identified by QA personnel, MAJCOM and AF
IG, LCAP inspections, or audit reports. In addition to utilizing QA inspectors, subject matter
experts, cross utilizing flight or section chiefs etc. can be used to conduct the Activity
Inspections. The reviews are planned, coordinated, and executed by the QA Focal Point. Activity
inspection intervals will not exceed 12 months. CPSD will use Special Inspections to evaluate
maintenance and logistics procedures.

8.9.2. The MXW/MXG/CC/CL will determine the scope of the units inspection.

8.9.2.1. (Added) The activity inspection should encompass a statistical sampling of all
sections/flights of the organization being inspected and unit self inspection programs within each
inspected section/flight. Whenever possible, locally required inspections conducted by outside
agencies (e.g., wing safety, training, security, LRS, BE, or the fire department) should be
accomplished in conjunction with the QA activity inspection. This reduces the number of
disruptions to the organization being inspected and also increases the comprehensiveness of the
activity inspection. However, if outside agencies accomplish a separate inspection within the
activity inspection year, these can also be counted as part of the annual activity inspection.

8.9.3.1. (Added) Activity Inspection Reports. Inspectors should work with the inspected
organization to assist in performing root cause analysis and developing corrective action plans
328                                            AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012


for Wing wide systemic issues.

8.9.4. (Added) Follow-up Inspections. Depending upon the severity of discrepancies and the
overall rating, the MXW/MXG/CC/CL will direct specific follow-up inspections. Follow-up
inspections must not cause other inspections to be delayed.

8.10. Maintenance Standardization and Evaluation Program (MSEP). As AFMC OPR, HQ
AFMC/A4US will implement, manage and execute the command’s LCAP and QA programs.

8.10.4.1. (Added) QA will develop and track inspection reports until closed and compile a
report highlighting all findings, problem areas and any recommended improvements as a
minimum and provide to MXW/MXG/CC or equivalent leadership.

8.10.8.9. AFMC Conventional Munitions Program. To ensure quality assurance of AFMC
munitions activities, the unique organizational alignment and mission of AFMC units must be
addressed. AFMC munitions activities will follow their group QA program (if established) or
develop an instruction to institute a QA program within their areas of responsibility and
coordinate through HQ AFMC/A4U and A4MW to ensure applicability and intent has been
addressed. In non-group established QA programs, QA must report directly to the squadron
CC/CL or higher function. The activity will use applicable paragraph in 8.10.8.9.1 thru
8.10.8.9.8. In addition, use Table 8.1 to ensure munitions, maintenance, and equipment quality
and reliability.

8.10.8.9.9. (Added) The following munitions activities will perform all 19 QA items listed in
paragraph 8.10.8.9. and Table 8.1: The 377 MXS (Kirtland). NOTE: Item 9 may not apply to
units that do not have missiles or trailers.

8.10.8.9.10. (Added) The following munitions activities will add QA items 10-17 listed in Table

8.10.9. Unit MSEP Evaluation and Inspection Plan (E&I Plan). QA OIC/SUPT (MXG QA
Chief) will develop an E&I Plan containing areas, types and numbers of inspections and
evaluations that must be conducted. for their respective MXG/SQ and will be coordinated
through the appropriate MXG/SQ/CC/CL (if applicable, SQ MOO/Supt). QA will update/revise,
publish and distribute a MXG/CC/CL/CD approved quarterly plan. The E&I Plan will be
developed using the criteria listed below:

8.10.9.1.1. (Added) Consider historical PEs, QVIs, and other inspections data (especially any
items having a pass rate of less that 80 percent); not mission capable (NMC) causes; aborts and
trends; in-flight emergencies (IFE) and trends; high component or system failure rates;
repeat/recurring/CND discrepancies trends; Deficiency Report (DR)/ Service Report (SR) trends;
suspected training deficiencies; technical data violations (TDVs), detected safety violations
(DSVs), and tasks outlined in aircraft -6 TOs.

8.10.9.4. (Added- AFMC) In addition to paragraphs 8.10.9.1. thru 8.10.9.3., the Evaluation and
Inspection Plan will be developed using the criteria listed in paragraphs 8.10.9.4.1. thru
8.10.9.4.22.:

8.10.9.4.1. (Added) E& I Plan will be organized in sections communicating specific types of
quality processes/procedures required (Identifies specific detailed quality processes and
procedures relative to a particular group/squadron), defines specific roles and responsibilities per
wing/group/SQ (what shall be accomplished, by whom, when, how, and what documents are
used and how they are controlled), and how those quality processes are implemented:
Requirements, Processes to include Documentation Process, Evaluations, Inspections, and QA
Surveillance Plan/Schedule (QASP).

8.10.9.4.2. (Added) QA Chief will review the E&I Plan for compliance to this instruction, at
least quarterly or when major changes, updates, or revisions are made. This plan meets the
requirements of AFMCI 63-501, AFMC Quality Assurance, for production maintenance CORs.

8.10.9.4.3. (Added) Identify the assessment type (i.e., task, specific item, procedure or process)
and minimum number (determined by the documented methodology (e.g. ANSI- Z1.4 2003) or
rationale used in the program administration section of the E&I Plan) of Personnel Evaluations
(PE), Quality Verification Inspections (QVI), and Routine Inspection List (RIL) and assessment
areas to be conducted monthly

8.10.9.4.4. (Added) Identify by name of Personnel Evaluations (PE), Evaluator Proficiency
Evaluations (EPE) evaluations due during the month the E&I plan is published and conduct these
Evaluations on core/special skills qualified tasks. Any Evaluations not conducted during the
month scheduled will be carried forward to the next month and can only be carried forward one
month total. Requires Group/SQ CC approval. Additionally, an explanation/justification for not
completing the evaluation is required and will be included in the monthly summary and monthly
briefing.

8.10.9.4.5. (Added) Assessment Areas. For the purpose of planning and conducting
assessments, major workloads will be broken down into assessment areas and documented in the
E&I Plan (Program Administration and Surveillance Schedule) (As applicable). Assessment
areas are defined as segments or portions of a workload, system, component, process, procedure,
or subject matter that is investigated, inspected, evaluated or audited.

8.10.9.4.6. (Added) Methods for inspecting, evaluating, and rating technician proficiency,
equipment condition etc.

8.10.9.4.7. (Added) Key Task Listing (KTL).

8.10.9.4.8. (Added) Routine Inspection List (RIL) requirements.

8.10.9.4.9. (Added) Identify type and frequency of reports required by Wing QA office.

8.10.9.4.10. (Added) Define the process for control, routing and follow-up of the
AFMC Form 77, Request for Quality Assistance or local equivalent.

8.10.9.4.11. (Added) Define the corrective action and preventive action process to be
accomplished by production units. Care should be taken to determine root causes of deficiencies
rather than simply treating symptoms. The process will, as a minimum:

8.10.9.4.11.1. (Added) Include analysis of the defects and actions taken.

8.10.9.4.11.2. (Added) Include methods used by QA offices to communicate and cross-feed
information to other groups and wings.

8.10.9.4.11.3. (Added) Include methods used for QA to follow-up on corrective action taken by
unit, preventive action, or process changes made to prevent recurrence or new occurrences of
similar non-conformances.

8.10.9.4.12. (Added) Establish standards for Discrepancies/Quality Assessment Results (QAR)
ratings.

8.10.9.4.13. (Added) Define local process for documenting deficiencies, corrective/ preventive
action, and follow-up data into MIS.

8.10.9.4.14. (Added) Define requirements to analyze quality deficiency and acceptance
inspection reports and recommend appropriate corrective and preventive action to production
divisions.

8.10.9.4.15. (Added) Data collected, type of analysis done, reports to be accomplished and
review level as a minimum
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012                                                333


8.10.9.4.16. (Added) Develop a QA Surveillance Schedule/Plan (QASP) by unit and evaluators.

8.10.9.4.17. (Added) Procedures to determine Acceptable Quality Levels (AQL).

8.10.9.4.18. (Added) Acceptable Quality Levels (AQL)/Standards. A standard is the acceptable
quality level (number of minor defects) that can be considered satisfactory as a process average
or conforming to established criteria.

8.10.9.4.18.1. (Added) An AQL/standard denotes the maximum allowable number of minor
findings for any assessment. It must be strict enough that the task, process, or product meets an
acceptable level of quality, but is not so strict that a CAT I / QAR-1 rating is unattainable. The
AQL/standard is derived from QA performance-based data. MXW/MXG QA will develop
procedures for determining minimum AQL/standard levels delineating an “attainable” quality
level. These levels will comprise the AQL standards for all assessment types.

8.10.9.4.18.2. (Added) Failure to meet an AQL/standard results in the assessment being rated as
a CAT I/CAT II MAJOR failure. An identified major finding would also result in an assessment
being rated as a failure.

8.10.9.4.19. (Added) The unit MSEP Evaluation and Inspection Plan implemented at the MXG
level with sections dedicated for each squadron.

8.10.9.4.20. (Added) The Evaluation and Inspection Plan will be developed and reviewed
monthly and updated quarterly.

8.10.10.2.1. (Added) The QA Evaluation and Inspection Plan will define “readily detectable”
for CAT II discrepancies.

8.10.11.2. CAT II minors shall be documented for trends, and will be counted against the AQL.

8.10.13.3.1. (Added) UCR. An unsatisfactory condition is defined as an event/discrepancy that
requires immediate supervisory intervention to ensure safety or process/product fit, form, or
function reliability. Unsatisfactory conditions are deemed major and will be documented as a
UCR. A condition of a minor nature shall be documented against the applicable checklist or its
regulatory guidance.

8.10.14. Personnel Evaluations (PE). A PE is a direct evaluation on any personnel or team who
perform, supervise, inspect, evaluate, instruct, or train a logistics/maintenance task. QA will
provide notice not less than one hour prior to the evaluation. QA will determine what task will
be evaluated. The PE will be on work in-progress or work about to begin. Use PEs to evaluate
job proficiency, degree of training, and compliance with technical data. PEs will be used to
evaluate newly certified personnel/teams, process changes to include the new processes and
procedures and equipment changes. Individuals performing or certifying maintenance tasks are
subject to a PE. Rate PEs “pass” or “fail” based on established AQLs/standards. Document the
PE on AF Form 2419, Routing and Review of Quality Control Report, MIS, or in the MAJCOM-
approved database. Ensure personnel performing maintenance on aircraft/equipment pass a
334                                            AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012


Personnel Evaluation (PE) every 24-months. Failed evaluations will result in a re-evaluation
within 30 days.

8.10.14.1. The PE will include an evaluation of the individual’s training records, tool box/tool
kit, TMDE and TO. General maintenance practices that relate directly to the task being
performed (e.g., safety, material handling, use of tools and equipment, Foreign Object Damage
prevention, Electrostatic Discharge prevention, and workmanship) will be examined during the
PE. Other maintenance practices may also be examined as locally determined.

8.10.14.1.2.1. (Added) The team task is rated as an overall “pass” or “fail”. Team evaluations
will be scored the same as PEs. During team evaluations, errors committed by team member(s)
and not detected by team chief may also be attributed to the team chief.

8.10.14.2. Individuals or team members will be decertified (on the evaluated task) by their
supervisor for a failed PE rating in accordance with applicable training regulations. Determine
ratings as follows:

8.10.18. Acceptable Quality Levels (AQL/Standards). When establishing the AQL consider at
least six months of data on evaluations performed, and other pertinent data. Consider combining
items of equipment within a general equipment type having nearly identical standards. QA has
the option to create an AQL formula for inspecting only a portion of a task once a baseline
standard for a large task is established (e.g. aircraft phase/ISO inspection has an AQL of 6, if QA
inspects 50% of the task, the AQL would be 3).

8.10.20. The MXW/GP/unit must conduct quarterly meetings to review the visual information,
graphs, narratives, quality trends identified through inspections and evaluations, discussion of
common problem areas and descriptions of successful programs or initiatives in the monthly
summary per paragraph 8.10.19 above. Meeting minutes to include slide presentation with
corrective actions plans and will be posted on the Quality Assurance Community of Practice
(CoP).

8.10.20.1. (Added) For CPSD the information contained in the MSEP Summary, distributed
quarterly, satisfies requirements for sections chiefs responsible for maintenance.

8.11. Lead Command-approved QA database. If unit developed databases that include the
minimum data field requirements listed in paragraph 8.11.1. thru 8.11.14., then the unit will
forward a copy to HQ AFMC/A4US for review and approval.

8.12.2.4. At the heart of the R&M effort are many improvement programs such as PIP, IDEA,
productivity, reliability, availability, maintainability (PRAM) program, and PIWGs. The PIM is
an integral part of the information gathering and education process of PIWGs. This is
accomplished by emphasizing and promoting the PIP through to maintenance technicians and
supervisors during visits to work centers. To enhance R&M, the PIM will:

8.12.2.4.8. (Added) Report unit factors contributing to a deficiency to the appropriate local
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012                                             335


agency or supervisor for resolution.

8.12.2.4.9. (Added) Identify potential PIWG items by the letter P on the DR logs.

8.12.2.4.10. (Added) Attend PIWGs, or provide adequate background on PIWG issues to
AFMC functional managers to allow for quality representation.

8.12.2.4.11. (Added) Evaluate the overall unit configuration management program by reviewing
technical, managerial, and documentation aspects of the program and reporting any deficiencies
to appropriate local manager or as directed in TO 00-5-15, Air Force Time Compliance
Technical Order Process, and AFMC instructions. Immediate action, urgent action, and safety
TCTOs require particular attention and emphasis.

8.12.2.4.12. (Added) Monitor and document initial compliance on TCTOs and determine depth
and frequency of inspection coverage. Coverage is directly related to the complexity of the
TCTO as well as to how critical the system or the component is to be modified.

8.12.2.4.13. (Added) Support verification, validation and TCTO kit proofing, OTIs and
command-directed modifications.

8.12.2.4.14. (Added) Along with the TCTO monitor, attend all TCTO planning and recon-
ciliation meetings.

8.12.2.4.15. (Added) Ensure all test aircraft that do not meet TCTO applicability criteria due to
installed modifications are identified and tracked in a comprehensive database system. This non-
applicability list will reference the waiver of compliance signed by the MXG/CC.

8.12.2.4.16. (Added) Coordinate with the MOF PS&D and the combined flight test (CFT)
modification manager (when necessary), the PIM will ensure all aircraft that are de-modified
have a conformity check (de-mod reconciliation) complied with to ensure aircraft TCTOs are
reinstated (as applicable).

8.13. Configuration Management (CM) and Modification Management. Configuration
management includes formulating and submitting modification proposals, and tracking unit
concerns being worked by depots and/or contractors. A modification proposal is a
recommendation to change the operation, use, or appearance of Air Force equipment (also
known as form, fit, and function). A requirement IAW AFI 10-601 is necessary to start the
process to modify Air Force Equipment modifications, and a completed AF Form 1067,
Modification Proposal can act as a requirement. If a requirement does not already exist, submit
proposed modifications on an AF Form 1067. After approval by the appropriate Configuration
Review Board (CRB), mail or fax the proposal to the HQ AFMC/A4M functional area manager
for information purposes and to the equipment Single Manager (SM) for Configuration Control
Board (CCB) approval and review. In no case modify any Air Force equipment without a TCTO
or CCB directive. Specific modification configuration control authority unique to AFMC test
centers will be defined in the base supplement to AFI 21-101.
336                                          AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                 26 APRIL 2012


8.13.2.1. (Added) Command-directed temporary (T-1 and T-2) modifications are similar to
TCTOs; however, they are temporary, and there is no corresponding change to approved weapon
system technical data. The approved modification instruction is the authority for both
modification and maintenance as long as the modification is installed. To maintain configuration
control, command-directed modifications are documented in the same manner as TCTOs. QA
must maintain a copy of the command T-1 and T-2 modification instructions on file until they

assess all work centers to identify FOD critical areas. Any work center where a misplaced or
dropped tool or item could reasonably be expected to cause serious damage to
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP                  26 APRIL 2012                                                339


personnel/equipment or adversely affect research and development (R&D) mission
accomplishment will be designated FOD critical. The following areas are, by their nature, FOD-
critical areas: Work on or near the flightline, work on or near aircraft/engines and work on
equipment designated to be installed on an aerospace vehicle.

10.2.1.9.1. If paper product is used, control procedures for their use will be identified in local
instructions.

DEV 10.2.1.15. Procedures need developed for critical and non-critical FOD potential areas. In
FOD critical areas the same individual that signs out a CTK cannot sign it back in. In non-critical
FOD potential areas the same person can sign TK/CTKs in and out. Clarify in local procedures
how to ensure oversight of this process. Any work center where a misplaced or dropped tool or
item could reasonably be expected to cause serious damage to personnel/equipment or adversely
affect research and development (R&D) mission accomplishment will be designated FOD
critical. The following areas are, by their nature, FOD critical areas: Work on or near the
flightline, work on or near aircraft/engines and work on equipment designated to be installed on
an aerospace vehicle.

requirements when making CTK determinations. Insure user input is considered when
determining quantity, content and layout of toolkits.

10.3.6. Tools will be described on the MIL to accurately depict the actual size or type to ensure
positive tool control, i.e. screwdriver, common, 6 inches; socket, 3/8 drive X 5/8. Flight/section
chiefs or equivalent will ensure MIL is updated, approved and signed at least annually.

NOTE: Flight commanders/flight chiefs or equivalent must review and sign the MIL. For
weapons load crew CTKs, the WWM will approve and sign the MIL. A copy of the MIL will
also remain in each CTK/equipment kit at all times for inventory purposes.

10.3.6.5.1 If not using the MIL or TAS to document missing/removed tools then use AFMC
IMT Form 61 to annotate missing/removed tools

new tool kits are built, or existing kits are replaced, the WWID will be utilized.

10.3.13.4. (Added) If previously issued serviceable tools are to be used as replacement tools,
completely de-etch any prior CTK WWID assigned markings.

10.4.1. Contractors, MEOs and CPSD are required to use a system of their choice as long as it
complies with the intent of the program.

10.4.1.2. If an automated system is not available, units may use AFMC Form 62, CTK
Inventory and Control Log, to sign in and out CTKs/TKs and use AFMC Form 61,
Missing/Removed Tools and Equipment, to document Missing/Removed tools.

10.4.2. If an automated system is not available, units may use AFMC IMT 62 or computer
generated equivalent to document separate shift inventories.

10.4.2.1. Include all tools, non CA/CRL and CA/CRL equipment and equipment kits.

10.4.2.1.1. (Added) Local publications will specify inventory procedures (e.g. frequency,
responsibilities, breaks, lunch time, when an individual leaves, CTK used by more than one
person, etc.). The intent is to be able to identify the point at which a lost item would most
effectively be located.

10.4.2.1.2. (Added) Supervisors are responsible for tool and equipment accountability and
control. When a person removes a tool or piece of equipment, they are responsible for that item
until it is returned. Local publications will provide procedure for accountability when items are
removed. Supervisors will be responsible to initiate lost tool procedures.

14.20.1. Cannot Duplicate (CND) Discrepancies. Personnel will make every effort to duplicate
the circumstances that created the reported discrepancy. When a discrepancy cannot be
duplicated, the technician will document "Cannot Duplicate Malfunction" or "CND" in the
corrective action block, and ensure the symbol is cleared IAW TO 00-20-1.

14.20.3. (Added) Deferred Discrepancy Management

14.20.3.1. (Added) Deferred Discrepancies. Timely accomplishment of deferred maintenance is
the responsibility of the applicable AMU and/or MXS Flights. Uncorrected discrepancies not
creating NMC or PMC status are deferred discrepancies and loaded into MIS as soon as possible.
Discrepancies are considered deferred as soon as they are discovered and the decision is made to
delay corrective action. Discrepancies deferred due to non-availability of parts are promptly
loaded to MIS when backordered through supply. The decentralized supply support/material
control section enters supply data against deferred discrepancies and notifies the PS&D and work
center once parts are received. Discrepancies will not remain in "unscheduled" status for more
than 1 workday from the date of discovery. Discrepancies with a scheduled start date and time
greater than 5 days after the date of discovery are reportable deferred discrepancies.
Discrepancies scheduled but not accomplished on the date scheduled are counted and reported in
the deferred discrepancy rate. AWP discrepancies with a valid off-base requisition are reportable
deferred discrepancies. TCTOs, TCIs, SIs, and OTIs in deferred status are not reportable
deferred discrepancies.

14.20.3.1.1. (Added) The deferred discrepancy file, although centralized in the computer, is still
considered as two separate and distinct files: one consisting of discrepancies AWP, and the other
consisting of discrepancies AWM. The responsibility for maintaining AWM discrepancies in
MIS lies with the technician who makes the inputs. The MX Supt or designated representative
will develop procedures for reviewing the deferred discrepancy file and identifying any problem
areas requiring resolution. Constant monitoring of MIS (IMDS screen #380) is required to
ensure scheduled work is deferred again if not completed. The AWP file is maintained by
decentralized supply support/materiel control.

14.20.3.1.2. (Added) Equipment discrepancy files for equipment other than aircraft, may be
decentralized to the appropriate shop.

14.20.4. (Added) Discrepancies deferred for parts:

14.20.4.1. (Added) Decentralized supply support/materiel control promptly loads the supply
document number into MIS for each aircraft discrepancy, which cannot be corrected due to
backordered parts. Units using the SBSS module of MIS follow procedures outlined in AFCSM
21-579, Vol 2.

14.20.4.2. (Added) The decentralized supply support/materiel control notifies the production
superintendent, expediter, and MOC when MICAP parts are received.

Chapter 18 - CONTRACT SURVEILLANCE

18. (Added) Introduction. The objective of logistics program management is to integrate the
performance-based operation into the supported AF mission, monitor the life-cycle management
of government property, and execute the business end of the AF programs. This chapter applies
to AF units performing duties across the full spectrum of logistics. This includes conventional
force logistics units; nuclear and nuclear support units; space; special operations; wholesale-level
procurement, sustainment, and maintenance; logistics support to research, test, and development
units; and logistics support to special access programs. This chapter establishes guidelines for
performance management and surveillance of performance-based activities performing make and
repair activities which include all organizations within the wholesale and base-level logistics
enterprise that conduct activities related to the manufacture and repair of assets to support
weapon systems. This encompasses organizations that perform generation, launch, recovery,
ground handling, and servicing of aircraft. It includes organizations that perform manufacturing,
maintenance (organizational/ intermediate/depot to include on-equipment maintenance/repair
and off-equipment maintenance/repair functions) repair, calibration, overhaul, or inspection of:
aircraft, aerospace equipment, aircraft engines, support equipment/tools, conventional munitions,
nuclear munitions, missiles, vehicles, components, and other non-flying weapon systems and
related activities. This chapter shall be used in concert with AFI 63-101 and other applicable
guidance, FAR, etc, (or the instruction in existence at the time of contract award). This includes
contracts totaling $250K or more.

18.1. Government Contract Quality Assurance. COR is used to describe all government
personnel appointed to surveil service contracts.

18.1.1. AFMC units to include Maintenance wings (ALCs), maintenance groups (test wings and
AEDC) and air base wings which have performance-based maintenance or maintenance support
activities shall establish a single, centralized program management office (PMO) also know as
Contract Management Office (CMO). For installations which have performance-based
maintenance and maintenance support activities shared between two or more wings, the wing
which established the contract will be responsible for overseeing and managing the contractor’s
performance. The PMO will consist of a full time, dedicated staff to initiate, oversee and
manage performance-based activities within the maintenance wing/group. The PMO will consist
of a program manager, COR chief(s) and COR(s). The Chief COR may serve as both the
program manager and Chief COR when the workload does not justify both positions.
Additionally ACO/PCOs who administer the performance-based maintenance contracts will be
assigned or matrixed to the PMO to ensure a comprehensive team focused on administration and
management of the contracted operations. The office may include subject matter experts from
various functional areas (e.g., CE, communications, contracting, finance, plans, and logistics).
All contracts will be coordinated with the PMO to ensure consistency and standardization of
PWSs and to minimize the number of contracts for similar operations.

18.1.1.1. (Added) The PMO will:

18.1.1.1.1. (Added) Develop guidance for and coordinate on all PPs.

systems such as IMIS, FEMS, AMCS, IMDS, CEMS, G081, SBSS, and AFEMS are mandated
in the PWS where practicable.

18.1.1.1.8. (Added) Conduct a quarterly review of activities with COR chief(s), CORs and
ACO/PCOs.

18.1.1.1.9. (Added) Develop local procedures to ensure standardized PMAP and documenta-
tion.

18.1.1.1.10. (Added) Keep up-to-date on mission changes that could affect creation of a
contract modification and advise the FC/FD.
