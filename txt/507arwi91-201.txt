    commander and/or designated representative to issue the ammunition to their personnel. An
    AF Form 710, Combat Arms Training Record, will be initiated and all blank ammunition
    will be issued and accounted for via that form. Rounds issued will be annotated in the
    "Target No." portion of the form. Rounds used will be annotated in the "Rounds Used"
    section of the form, and "Group" section will reflect the actual number of rounds returned.
    8.8. Prior to training, the exercise supervisor or WSO will ensure all personnel are given a
    safety brief on the proper use, misfire procedures as outlined in AFMAN 10-100 and the
    disposition of blank ammunition. The WSO will certify that the briefing was given through
    written documentation. The preferred method for documentation is to annotate the briefing
    in the remarks portion of the AF Form 710 and have personnel print their name and sign in
    that section to attest to that certification. This record will remain on file for a period of one
    year.
    8.9. The safety briefing will contain as a minimum the following points:
       8.9.1. Ammunition identification, to include pictures of 5.56mm blank and live
       ammunition.
       8.9.2. The exact location of use.
       8.9.3. Blank and/or training ammunitions will not be fired and/or discharged any closer
       to personnel than specified in paragraphs 8.9.3.1 and 8.9.3.2.
           8.9.3.1. The 5.56mm blank ammunition (P/N: M200) will not be fired and/or
           discharged any closer to personnel than 20 feet. P/N M200 ammunition is used in
           M16/M16A2/M4 rifles, GUU-5/P sub machine guns and M249 automatic rifles. Air

   for guard weapons. No individual assigned as a weapons guard may participate in the
   exercise. When it is necessary to have live ammunition present at an exercise involving
   blank munitions for real world security; the guard’s weapon should be a different caliber, for
   example M9, to prevent co-mingling of training and live munitions.
   8.14. Prior to issue and after turn-in, all blank ammunition will be inspected and inventoried
   by the unit’s WSO and/or the designated supervisor. Any out of balance condition will be
   cause for suspension of all training operations until the condition is resolved.
   8.15. Turn-in:
      8.15.1. Commanders and/or their WSO will ensure all personnel and/or equipment is
      inspected for any unexpended munitions. Commanders and/or their WSO will ensure all
      live and blank ammunition is kept segregated.
      8.15.2. Commanders or their WSO will visually inspect all ammunition turned-in. Keep
      live ammunition segregated from blank ammunition and misfired(misfired ammo)
      ammunition. The WSO will return it to the MASO in the original containers upon
      termination of the exercise. The quantity should be annotated on a piece of tape placed
      over the original quantity.
      8.15.3. All unexpended rounds will be returned to the point of issue, along with any dud
      and/or damaged ammunition, upon completion of the exercise.
      8.15.4. Expenditures: To the maximum extent possible, all expended brass generated
      during the training exercise will be picked up, inspected, placed in containers and turned
      into the local Combat Arms Training and Maintenance (CATM) or MASO.

                        EXPLOSIVE HAZARD CLASSIFICATIONS

A3.1. Explosive Hazard Classifications:
   A3.1.1. Hazard Classification (UN)
   A3.1.2. Class/Division 1.1 (Old DoT Class "A") MOST HAZARDOUS
   A3.1.3. Class/Division 1.2 (Old DoT Class "A")
   A3.1.4. Class/Division 1.3 (Old DoT Class "B")
   A3.1.5. Class/Division 1.4 (Old DoT Class "C")
   A3.1.6. Class/Division 1.5 (New Division)
   A3.1.7. Class/Division 1.6 (New Division)
A3.2. Hazard Class/Division 1.1. Items assigned to this class are principally a blast hazard and
may be expected to mass detonate when a small portion is initiated. Examples are high explosive
bombs, warheads, composition C-4, TNT blocks, and blasting caps.
A3.3. Hazard Class/Division 1.2.
A3.4. Three subdivisions: 1.2.1, 1.2.2 and 1.2.3. 1.2.1 Items weigh more than 1.6 lbs. NEW
1.2.2 Items weigh less than 1.6 lbs. NEW. 1.2.3 is a special storage category; see AFM 91-201,
para. 3.5.25. Items assigned to this class are those for which the principal hazards are fragments
or blasts, either individually or in combination. Minimum separation distances are based on the
range of fragments. An example is the M115 Ground Burst Simulator (GBS), HC/D (04) 1.2.2 d
(The (04) indicates a 400 ft fragmentation radius)
A3.5. Hazard Class/Division 1.3. Items assigned to this class usually burn vigorously (mass fire
hazard) with little or no possibility of extinguishing fires that have gained headway in storage
situations. Examples of items included in this class are military pyrotechnics and solid
propellants.
A3.6. Hazard Class/Division 1.4. Items assigned to this class present primarily a moderate fire
hazard producing no blast and virtually no fragmentation or toxic hazards beyond normal fire
hazard distance. Examples of items included in this class are small arms ammunition and
colored smoke grenades.
A3.7. Hazard Class/Division 1.5. Consists of very insensitive explosives. Comprised of
substances which have a mass explosion hazard but are so insensitive that there is very little
probability of initiation or transition from burning to detonation under normal conditions of
transport. Examples are some blasting agents used in mining/construction industries.
A3.8. Hazard Class/Division 1.6. Consists of extremely insensitive articles which do not have a
mass explosive hazard. Contains only extremely insensitive detonating substances and which
demonstrate a negligible probability of accidental initiation or propagation.    The risk from
articles of Division 1.6 is limited to the explosion of a single article.
507ARWI91-201 15 APRIL 2011                                                                     17

                          EXPLOSIVE COMPATIBILTY GROUPS

13 Groups
Group A--Initiating Explosive. These are bulk explosives with the necessary sensitivity to heat,
friction, or percussion that makes them suitable as initiating elements in an explosives train.
Examples: Wet lead azide, wet lead styphnate, wet mercury fulminate, wet tetracene, dry RDX,
and dry PETN.
Group B--Detonators and Similar Initiating Devices. These are items which contain initiating
explosives that are designed to start or continue the functioning of an explosives train. Examples:
Detonators, blasting caps, small arms primers, and detonating fuses without two or more safety
features.
Group C--Bulk Propellants, Propelling Charges, and Devices Containing Propellant, With or
Without Their Means of Ignition. These are items that will deflagrate, explode, or detonate upon
initiation. Liquid propellants are not included. Examples: Single, double, and triple base and
composite propellants, rocket motors (solid propellant, and ammunition with inert projectiles).
Group D--Black Powder, High Explosives (HE), Ammunition Containing HE Without Its Own
Means of Initiation and Without Propelling Charge, and Fuses With Two or More Safety
Features. These are ammunition and explosive items that can be expected to explode or detonate
when any given item or any of its components are initiated. Examples: Bulk TNT, Comp B,
black powder, wet RDX or PETN, bombs, projectiles, and CBUs.
Group E--Ammunition Containing HE Without Its Own Means of Initiation and With Propelling
Charge (Other Than One Containing a Flammable or Hypergolic Liquid). Examples: Artillery
ammunition, rockets, and guided missiles.
Group F--Ammunition Containing HE With Its Own Means of Initiation and With a Propelling
Charge (Other Than One Containing a Flammable or Hypergolic Liquid) or Without Propelling
Charges.
NOTE: As used in groups D, E, and F, "with its own means of initiation" indicates that the
ammunition has its normal initiating device assembled to it, and this device is considered to
present a significant risk. However, the term does not apply when the initiating device is
packaged so there is no risk of detonating the ammunition if the device functions accidentally. It
also does not apply when fused end items are configured and packaged so that they cannot be
armed.
Initiating devices may be assembled to the ammunition when their safety features preclude
initiation or detonation of the end item if the initiating device functions accidentally. In this
case, the item is considered to be "without its own means of initiation." For example, hand
grenades are considered "with their own means of initiation" because the fuse has no out-of-line
component. It will detonate the grenade if the fuse is initiated.
Conversely, 20 millimeter (mm) high explosive incendiary (HEI) ammunition is considered to be
"without its means of initiation" because the fuse, if initiated, will not detonate the projectile
because of the out-of-line rotor.

Group G--Fireworks, Illuminating, Incendiary, Smoke (Including HC), or Tear-Producing
Munitions Other Than Those Munitions That Are Water-Activated, or Which Contain WP, or
Flammable Liquid or Gel. These are ammunition items which upon functioning, cause an
 18                                                           507ARWI91-201 15 APRIL 2011


incendiary, illumination, lachrymation (tear gas), smoke, or sound effect. Examples: Flares,
signals, incendiary or illuminating ammunition, smoke, or tear-producing devices.
Group H--Ammunition Containing Both Explosives and WP or Other Pyrophoric Material.
These are ammunition items which contain fillers that are spontaneously flammable when
exposed to the atmosphere. Examples: WP, plasticized white phosphorus (PWP), and other
ammunition containing pyrophoric material.
Group J--Ammunition Containing Both Explosives and Flammable Liquids or Gels. These are
ammunition items which contain flammable liquids or gels other than those which are
spontaneously flammable when exposed to water or the atmosphere. Napalm-filled fire bombs,
with or without explosive components, are included in this group.
Group K--Ammunition Containing Both Explosives and Toxic Chemical Agents. These are
ammunition items which contain chemicals specifically designed for incapacitating effects more
severe than lachrymation. (See restrictions in AFMAN 91-201, table 3.1, note 4.)
Group L--Ammunition Not Included in Other Compatibility Groups. These are ammunition
items that cannot be commingled with any other type of ammunition or explosives, or dissimilar
ammunition of this same group. Examples: Water-activated devices, prepackaged hypergolic
liquid-fueled rocket engines, fuel-air-explosives (FAE) devices, and pyrophorics such as TEA
(triethylaluminum) or TPA (thickened triethylaluminum). This group also includes damaged or
suspect ammunition or explosives of any other group. (Types presenting similar hazards may be
mixed together but not with other groups.)
Group N -- Articles containing only extremely insensitive detonating substances.
Group S--Ammunition Presenting No Significant Hazard. These are ammunition items
packaged or designed to confine hazardous effects arising from accidental functioning within the
package, unless the package has been degraded by fire. In this case, all blast or fragmentation
effects are limited so they do not significantly hinder fire fighting. Examples: Thermal batteries,
explosive switches or valves, and other ammunition items packaged to meet the criteria of the
compatibility group.
