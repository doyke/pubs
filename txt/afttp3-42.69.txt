           SOF MISSION, OPERATIONAL PRIORITIES AND CORE TASKS

1.1. Mission. United States Special Operations Command’s (USSOCOM) mission is to provide
fully capable and enabled SOF to defend the Nation’s interests in an environment characterized
by irregular warfare.

1.2. USSOCOM Priorities

   1.2.1. Deter, Disrupt & Defeat Terrorist Threats
              Plan and Conduct Special Operations
              Emphasize Persistent, Culturally Attuned Engagement
              Foster Interagency Cooperation

   1.2.2. Develop & Support Our People & Families
             Focus on Quality Care
             Care for our People and Families
             Train & Educate the Joint Warrior/Diplomat

   1.2.3. Sustain & Modernize the Force
              Equip the Operator
              Upgrade SOF Mobility
              Obtain Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaissance Systems


1.3. SOF Truths
    Humans Are More Important Than Hardware
    SOF Cannot Be Mass Produced
    Competent SOF Cannot Be Created After Emergencies Occur
    Quality Is Better Than Quantity
    Most Special Operations Require non-SOF Assistance

1.4. SOF Core Activities. America’s SOF are organized, equipped and trained, and then
deployed by USSOCOM to meet the high demands of Geographic Combatant Commanders
(GCCs). USSOCOM has the central role in planning and executing the worldwide campaign
against terrorism. In both its supported and supporting roles, the command will successfully
execute the mission as assigned and directed by the Secretary of Defense (SecDef). Title 10.
United States (U.S.) Code (USC) states that USSOCOM is to "prepare special operational forces
to carry out assigned missions." Preparation can cover areas such as: developing strategy,
doctrine, and tactics; training assigned forces; conducting special courses; validating and
prioritizing requirements; ensuring interoperability; monitoring promotions, retention and
assignments; developing and acquiring special equipment. These responsibilities drive the
command's eleven core tasks that stretch across the spectrum of peace and war. Forces provided
to the theater commanders must be highly capable and relevant to the needed tasks.

1.5. AFSOC Mission. The AFSOC mission is to present combat ready Air Force Special
Operations Forces to conduct and support global special operations missions.

1.6. SOF Operational Environment and Medical Support Implications. Special operations
are high risk/high gain operations; are usually conducted on short notice; are under significant
operations security (OPSEC) considerations; are generally in enemy held, denied, or sensitive
territory, and are conducted by specially organized, trained, and equipped forces in pursuit of
national objectives. Characteristic mission requirements of AFSOC mission profiles make it
necessary to modify conventional medical planning methods for providing medical support.

1.7. AFSOC Medical Mission Statement: Deploy with and in support of (ISO) SOF in order
to (IOT) deliver SOF combat medical support and to modernize and advance SOF medical
capabilities and technologies IOT maximize war-fighter performance. Provide high quality,
state-of-the-art prevention-based healthcare for AFSOC members, families and beneficiaries.

1.8. AFSOC Medical Capabilities. AFSOC medics provide a comprehensive medical platform
for SOF personnel across the healthcare continuum--prevention through intervention and
rehabilitation. SOF medics ensure deployable AFSOC forces via the employment of AFSOC
medical UTCs. AFSOC medics deploy with SOF IOT provide preventive and routine
healthcare, urgent/emergent point-of-injury trauma care, forward resuscitative/stabilization
surgery, intensive care, and Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC). Additionally, SOF medics
provide medical support for humanitarian operations, noncombatant evacuation operations
(NEO), civil affairs (CA), foreign internal defense (FID), counter-insurgency (COIN), and
unconventional warfare (UW) missions ISO IW/MSO, healthcare capacity building,
stability/security operations and medical support for other unique USSOCOM
missions/taskings.

1.9. The Challenge of AFSOC Medicine. Provide the highest quality healthcare for AFSOC
and joint SOF in a deployed setting, without the additional pillars of health services support,
without the benefit of fully developed traditional capabilities of care, and in areas of significantly
higher medical and operational risk during standard SOF or IW/MSO missions.

                                           Chapter 2

                 ORGANIZATIONS, ROLES, AND RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).

2.1.1. USSOCOM headquartered at MacDill AFB, Florida, is one of nine combatant commands
directly responsible to the President and SecDef. As a functional combatant command,
USSOCOM has been given lead responsibility for waging war on terrorism. Its duties in
connection with this responsibility include planning, directing, and executing SO in the conduct
of the war on terrorism. USSOCOM also provides SOF to support the GCC theater security
cooperation plans. The designation of SO as a Major Force Program makes USSOCOM unique
among the nine combatant commands in that it has service-like responsibilities to organize, train,
and equip its forces for SO missions.

2.1.2. USSOCOM has approximately 57,000 active duty, Reserve and National Guard Soldiers,
Sailors, Airmen, Marines and DoD civilians assigned to the headquarters, its four components
and one sub-unified command. USSOCOM’s components are: U.S. Army Special Operations
Command (USASOC), Naval Special Warfare Command (NAVSPECWARCOM), Air Force
Special Operations Command (AFSOC) and Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command
(MARSOC). The Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) is a USSOCOM sub-unified
command. (See Figure 2-1)

Figure 2-1 USSOCOM Component Commands

2.1.3. Theater Special Operations Commands (TSOCs). Theater Special Operations
Commands (TSOCs) are sub-unified commands established within each GCC. The function of
the TSOC is to ensure that SOF is fully integrated into the GCC collective security plans and
contingency operations. The TSOC commander plans and conducts joint special operations,
ensuring that SOF capabilities are matched to mission requirements while advising component
commanders’ in-theater on the proper employment of SOF. Additionally, TSOCs provide the
core element for establishing a Joint Special Operations Task Force (JSOTF), a quick reaction
command and control element that can respond immediately to regional emergencies. There are
joint service medical planners assigned to TSOCs. The seven TSOCs supporting geographic
combatant commanders worldwide are Special Operations Command Central (SOCCENT),
Special Operations Command Europe (SOCEUR), Special Operations Command Pacific
(SOCPAC), Special Operations Command South (SOCSOUTH), Special Operations Command
Korea (SOCKOR), Special Operations Command Africa (SOCAFRICA), and Special
Operations Command Joint Capabilities (SOCJC).

2.2. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC).

2.2.1. Headquarters. AFSOC is headquartered at Hurlburt Field, Florida; it functions as both
an Air Force MAJCOM and as the air component of USSOCOM. As a MAJCOM, AFSOC
retains Title 10 responsibilities to organize, train, equip, administer, and maintain special
operations forces for worldwide deployment and assignment to unified commands. As the air
component of USSOCOM, AFSOC provides AFSOF to accomplish assigned SO mission
activities. Also as the Air Force component, the AFSOC commander exercises command
authority consistent with operational control (OPCON) over all Continental United States
(CONUS)-based active and reserve AFSOF assets.

2.2.2. AFSOC Surgeon (SG). The AFSOC/SG functions as a MAJCOM/SG and as the air
component surgeon to USSOCOM. As a MAJCOM/SG, the AFSOC surgeon is responsible for
establishing, coordinating, and sustaining a healthcare system for AFSOC personnel and for
organizing, training, and equipping AFSOC medical forces for contingency medical support. As
the air component surgeon to USSOCOM, the AFSOC/SG plans execution of all Air Force
medical support for AFSOF and serves as the principal Air Force medical service advisor to
USSOCOM.

2.2.3. Organizational Structure. AFSOC medical units and line units with medical
responsibilities are currently organized into a wing, group, squadron and flight configurations.

2.2.3.1. AFSOC Supported Units. AFSOC provides leadership and oversight for the 1st
Special Operations Wing (SOW) at Hurlburt Field, FL, the 27th SOW at Cannon AFB, NM, the
352nd Special Operations Group (SOG) at RAF Mildenhall, United Kingdom, and the 353rd
SOG at Kadena Air Base (AB), Japan. The 352nd and 353rd SOGs are direct reporting units
(DRUs) to AFSOC/CC. AFSOC also has three other DRUs, all located at Hurlburt Field, FL:
the l8th Test Squadron; the 720th Special Tactics Group (STG); and the Air Force Special
Operations Training Center (AFSOTC). Additionally, AFSOC has ARC gained units: the 193rd
SOW of the Pennsylvania Air National Guard (ANG) at Harrisburg Airport, Middletown, PA;
the 9l9th SOW of the Air Force Reserve (AFRC) at Duke Field, FL.

                                           TRAINING

3.1. Medical Training Requirements. AFSOC medical training is tailored to each member’s
specialty. The overall objective of SOF medical training programs is to develop and maintain a
high state of mission readiness of AFSOC medical personnel for rapid employment across the
spectrum of SOF operational requirements. AFSOC medics interface with conventional,
nonconventional, joint and coalition medical forces as dictated by circumstances and
requirements. AFSOC medical personnel must be interoperable with all other SOF medical
personnel. AFSOC medics must be trained to perform their roles at night, during low-light or
blackout conditions, in environmental extremes and in combat environments.

3.2. Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) Medical Training. AFSOC medical personnel will
train and maintain medical readiness skills, clinical currency, medical licensure and specialty
credentials IAW AFI 41-106, Medical Readiness Program Management, AFI 44-119, Medical
Quality Operations, AFSOCI 48-101, Aeromedical Special Operations and USSOCOM
Directive 350-29, Special Operations Forces Medical Training, and other AFSOC guidance.
Metric requirements for tracking specific training will be provided by Headquarters (HQ)
AFSOC/SG.

3.3. AFSOC Medical Training. The AFSOC medical training program is designed to meet the
unique challenges of SO duty. There is considerable resource investment required to fully train
AFSOC medical personnel and then maintain a "mission ready" status. All AFSOC medical
personnel will meet all training requirements outlined in AFSOCI 48-101. Medical units will
track and report training status in accordance with AFI 41-106, AFI 10-201, Status of Resources
and Training System, and other AFSOC guidance. Metric requirements for tracking specific
training line items will be provided by HQ AFSOC/SG.

3.4. UTC Specific Training. AFSOC medical personnel assigned to deployable UTCs may
have additional training requirements in order to provide all capabilities as per Mission
Capability Statement (MISCAPS) as well as to ensure complete familiarity with UTC equipment
and supplies. These additional training requirements are outlined in AFSOCI 48-101. Medical
units will track and report training status in accordance with AFI 41-106, AFI 10-201, and other
AFSOC guidance. Metric requirements for tracking specific training line items will be provided
by HQ AFSOC/SG.

3.5. Operational Training. AFSOC medical personnel are expected to operate effectively
across a variety of austere, far-forward scenarios as well as, in the airborne environment on
AFSOC and other opportune SOF aircraft in comportment with Geneva Convention parameters
for non-combatants. The requirements for training include advanced survival training, additional
weapons familiarization training, night operations training, small unit tactics, aircraft emergency
procedures, egress training and use of aircraft emergency equipment. Additionally, AFSOC
medical personnel must be trained to meet USSOCOM interoperability requirements.

                                            Chapter 4

                                  AFSOC IW/MSO MISSION

4.1. Irregular Warfare/Medical Stability Operations (IW/MSO). AFSOC/SG IW/MSO
supports the overall GCC and United States Government (USG) IW/MSO Theater Security
Cooperation (TSC) plan. Joint Publication 1-02 (JP 1-02), Department of Defense Dictionary of
Military and Associated Terms, defines irregular warfare as; “A violent struggle among state and
non-state actors for legitimacy and influence over the relevant population(s). Irregular warfare
favors indirect and asymmetric approaches, though it may employ the full range of military and
other capacities, in order to erode an adversary’s power, influence, and will. Also called IW.”
DoDI 3000.05, Stability Operations defines Stability Operations as “An overarching term
encompassing various military missions, tasks, and activities conducted outside the United States
in coordination with other instruments of national power to maintain or reestablish a safe and
secure environment, provide essential governmental services, emergency infrastructure
reconstruction, and humanitarian relief.” DoDI 6000.16, Military Health Support for Stability
Operations defines MSO as “military health support for stability operations.”

4.1.1. IW and stability operations should be thought of as strategy, not tactics, and healthcare
and medical engagement can be used as a tool to support various IW and stability operations.
The ultimate focus of IW/MSO missions and operations are not on U.S. or Allied forces; rather,
it is on the PN military and civilian populations. The objective is to help PNs build their
healthcare/medical capabilities and delivery to their governed populations in order to gain or
secure their support.

4.1.2. Capacity building transfers knowledge and skills to individuals and institutions so they
can acquire the long term ability to establish effective policies and deliver competent service. By
ensuring the population’s security, the government hopes to receive the population’s support and
allegiance. This government provided security should help deter the population from seeking
security from other groups, including insurgents. Human security includes physical security, as
well as the population’s basic health needs (nutrition, water, shelter, and medical).

4.1.3. AFSOC is currently expanding its medical capabilities and developing new ones as
needed, to allow AFSOC to perform IW/MSO missions. Depending on the IW/MSO mission, it
is expected that most, if not all, the AFSOC medical UTCs, either as a whole or in part, can be
utilized. Specific missions, treatment and/or training requirements, will be under the direction of
and coordinated with GCCs, TSOCs, and American Embassies (AMEMB). An appropriate
assessment of needs and requirements will be done prior to any mission.

4.1.4. AFSOC/SG has established two personnel UTCs (FFQE2 and FFQET) and one
equipment UTC (FFQEW) specifically for IW/MSO missions. Both the 1st SOMDG and the
27th SOMDG are tasked to support an FFQE2 and FFQET. The ARC medical unit, 193rd
Medical Group/ANG and the 919th Medical Squadron/AFRC are tasked to support one FFQE2
each. The FFQEW IW/MSO equipment sets are being built and will be assigned to the active
duty medical groups at Hurlburt Field, FL and Cannon AFB, NM.
AFTTP 3-42.69 4 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                   11


4.2. FFQE2, Medical Special Operations Forces (SOF) Irregular Warfare/Medical
Stability (IW/MSO) Team. This UTC provides medical personnel to execute missions ISO
IW/MSO. It is intended to support GCCs theater security cooperation program goals and
objectives by building partnership capacity in health and medical services and infrastructure. It
may also be used for missions and operations with USAF Combat Aviation Advisory (CAA)
squadrons by providing additional medical capabilities. It is primarily intended to deploy and
collocate with U.S. SOF forces. It may also deploy to work directly with local populations
through the PN’s ministries of defense or health or the U.S. Embassy country team. This UTC
can be deployed in total or increments to meet operational mission requirements. Air Force
Specialty Code (AFSC) substitution are authorized IAW War Mobilization Plan, Volume
(WMP-1), AFMS skill level substitutions are authorized IAW AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning
and Execution

4.3. FFQET, Special Operation Forces (SOF) Irregular Warfare (IW)/ Medical Stability
Operations Team Augmentation. This UTC provides additional medical personnel to execute
missions ISO IW/MSO. FFQET is designed to provide additional medical personnel to FFQE2.
It can collocate with PN forces and other DoD forces to support theater combatant commanders
during missions and operations. This UTC can be deployed in total or increments to meet
operational mission requirements. AFSC substitution are authorized IAW WMP-1, AFMS skill
level substitutions are authorized IAW AFI 10-403.

4.4. FFQEW, SOF IW/MSO Equipment. This UTC provides equipment sets that are
designed and packaged for individual medical specialties on the FFQE2 and FFQET. It includes
equipment and supplies to perform the medical care specific to that specialty and conduct
training to the PN military and civilian counter parts.

4.5. SOF IW/MSO Medical Team and Medical Team Augmentation Mission. The primary
mission of the FFQE2 and FFQET is to train for, prepare, and execute IW/MSO taskings to PN
as directed by USSOCOM in order to build PN sustainable capability. The teams may also
provide medical care and expertise to PNs as an adjunct to capacity building or as the sole task
(i.e. Medical Civil Affairs Program (MEDCAP), Dental Civil Affairs Program (DENTCAP),
etc.). Because of the structure and skill sets of the teams they may also be used for humanitarian
crisis response, either as a primary tasking or diversion from a primary mission location, and
should prepare for this possibility.

4.6. SOF IW/MSO Medical Team and Medical Team Augmentation Responsibilities.

4.6.1. UTC Team Chief. Both teams will have a designated Team Chief (TC). The TC is
responsible for ensuring the team member roster is updated and accurate. The TC also ensures
all team members meet training requirements for deployment IAW this TTP and any needs
required for each mission. The TC ensures all UTC personnel are trained and mobility qualified.

4.6.2. Team Member Responsibilities. IW/MSO teams are configured to be small, mobile
training teams, many times working in remote areas with little support. All team members
should be able to perform multiple duties within the team that enables the team to accomplish its
mission. All team members are expected to accomplish duties within their respective AFSC skill

                                    COMMUNICATIONS

5.1. Deployment Communications. While deployed, SOF IW/MSO personnel must be able to
communicate with other SOF IW/MSO members, their home-station medical group (MDG),
SOW, and AFSOC headquarters as well as their area of operations (AO) associated TSOC via
secure and non-secure phone and internet transmission modes. The key to good communications
and connectivity with other elements includes good pre-deployment mission planning as well as
having redundant and various means of communication systems. SOF IW/MSO personnel
should coordinate deployed communications requirements with communications planners. To
ensure adequate communications, SOF IW/MSO teams must be prepared to deploy with and
operate, the communications equipment included in FFQEW.

5.2. Intra-team Communications. Given the frequent requirement to provide medical care at
multiple sites while deployed, the primary intra-team or local communications mechanism is a
Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) cell phone. Additionally, for emergencies
and contingency communication, the team should carry satellite phones (e.g. Iridium). At least 2
satellite phones should be considered. This will facilitate split team operations and redundancy.

5.3. Beyond-Line-of-Sight Communications. GSM cell phones and satellite phone can be
used for voice communication for non-sensitive or unclassified information. Secure voice
capability should also be available from the deployed site in at least one team location.

5.4. Internet Access. To maintain planning capacity, the SOF IW/MSO team should have
access to the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) for, at least, secure voice
capabilities. Since the majority of the IW/MSO missions are anticipated to be of a non-classified
nature, the SOF IW/MSO team must also have access to Non-secure Internet Protocol Router
Network (NIPRNET). Both SIPRNET and NIPRNET capabilities are necessary to meet
requirements for Operations Event/Incident Report (OPREP) and Situation Report (SITREP)
reporting to higher HQ and home station. Portable satellite internet systems such as the SOF
High Speed Agile Reach-back Kit (SHARK) are widely used by AFSOF forces and are presently
the standard. Others may be considered as technology progresses. An individual tracking device
should also be considered depending on the mission environment and team composition. These
are recommendations for team to home station and intra-team communications.

                                        DEPLOYMENT

6. Deployment phases. There are three phases to any deployment. The pre-deployment phase
is for completing all pre-deployment team preparation and coordination. The deployment phase
is for execution of the mission. The post deployment phase is for reconstitution of the team and
equipment.

 6.1. Pre-Deployment. The SOF IW/MSO team leader will ensure all deploying team members
have current training on Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP) IAW applicable GCC
regulations and USSOCOM Directive 525-4, Antiterrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP). This
consists of Level 1 AT. A specific AO threat intelligence update within 90 days prior to travel is
also required. Coordination with AFSOC Office of Special Investigations (OSI), AMEMB
Regional Security Officer (RSO) and applicable Military Group (MILGRP) must be made during
pre-deployment phase. All team personnel will receive an in-country threat brief within 72 hours
after they arrive at their Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) location. Uniform
and/or civilian clothing wear will be determined during the planning phase. AT plans will be
completed and approved IAW the Component Commander’s directive and USSOCOM Directive
525-4. Team leader (TL) will ensure all equipment and supplies are compiled to include all
training needs. Shipment of equipment and supplies need to be planned for well in advance to
ensure timely delivery at deployment site. Weapons will be addressed IAW USSOCOM
Directive 525-9, Deploying with Weapons and Ammunition.

6.1.1. Human Rights Vetting of Partner Nation Personnel. The vetting will be accomplished
as thoroughly as possible with the assistance of country team assets. This also needs to be
coordinated and usually accomplished by the embassy country team.

6.2. Deployment Phase. Travel to final destinations can be by either commercial or military
transportation. Team members must have a plan to maintain accountability and communication
intra-team and back to home station. All bed down, travel, food arrangements for the
deployment will be IAW pre-deployment planning. SITREPS will be completed and sent daily
to higher HQ.

6.3. Post Deployment Phase. A plan for equipment reconstitution will be set in motion. After
Action Reports (AAR) will be completed as soon as possible.

                            LOGISTICS, EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLY

7.1. Equipment. The FFQEW is the equipment UTC for FFQE2/T teams. It is modularized per
skill set of team members and can be deployed in part or total. Kits must receive an operational
test on an annual basis; this testing cannot be accomplished by exercising. Kits in general are not
designed to treat/care for population, but to teach/develop PN military and/or civilians to provide
basic healthcare.

7.1.1. The FFQEW is made up of the following kits:

7.1.1.1. Medical Treatment Kit: medications and materials to care for and treat team members

7.1.1.2. C&C/Admin/Logistics Support Kit: computers, audio-video equipment, laminator,
printer, radios, wireless intercom, language translation software, training aids, etc.

7.1.1.3. Pediatrician Kit

7.1.1.4. Public Health Bioenvironmental Engineering Kit (water testing, PID, pH meter, etc.)

7.1.1.5. Dental Kit

7.1.1.6. Optometry Kit

7.1.1.7. Biomedical Equipment Maintenance and Repair Kit

7.1.1.8. Pharmacy Kit

7.1.1.9. Laboratory Kit

7.1.1.10. Admin Kit.

7.2. Supplies. Supplies for the operation will be planned for and acquired during the pre-
deployment phase. The team and team leader will use what is available in FFQEW. They may
also arrange for additional supplies to be delivered to the PN as needed. The country teams,
GCCs/TSOCs and AFSOC/SGK can help facilitate the supply needs. As stated below, the type
of monies being spent for the mission will determine the supplies and how they may be used for
the benefit of the team and/or PN.

7.3. Additional support. The medical planning officer/noncommissioned officer (NCO)
interfaces with TSOC and AFSOC staff to plan for and coordinate medical readiness, medical
logistics, and mission planning needs of the AFSOC medical assets.

7.4. Funding Sources. IW/MSO missions will usually be a combination of medical treatment,
training, or other medical activities. Funding for these missions can come from varied sources.

It is important to understand the funding authorities and to stay within those authorities during
mission execution. The Major Force Program 2 (Operations and Maintenance (O&M)) Funds of
U.S.C. Title 10 monies allow US military forces to conduct military support in the GCC area of
responsibility (AOR). The predominance of the funds are used for O&M to train, advise, and
assist; intelligence capacity building; exercises; coalition development; and the overall
management of the program. U.S.C. Title 22 monies are State Department. Under the authority
of the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA), which provides a grand strategy for foreign assistance with
friendly nation, Title 22 authorizes the procurement of supplies, training, and equipment to
friendly foreign militaries (security assistance).
