1. General.
   1.1. The basic supervision structure for flying operations consists of the Operations Group
   Commander (OG/CC), the Supervisor of Flying (SOF) and the squadron supervisors, i.e.,
   Operations Supervisor (Ops Sup, also referred to as Top 3).
   1.2. The chain of supervision begins with the OG/CC, through the SOF, down to the
   individual squadron supervisors. The requirements for each position are specified in para 3.
   Specific duties and responsibilities are defined throughout this instruction.
   1.3. For the purpose of this instruction “experienced” is used in accordance with (IAW) the
   definition provided in the Mission Design Series (MDS) specific AFI 11-2MDS Volume 1.
      1.3.1. For the purposes of this instruction only, aircrews are also considered
      “experienced” when previously rated “experienced” in another MDS or previously rated
      “experienced” in a different crew position in the same MDS. These individuals must then
      be selected by the Squadron CC and approved by the OG/CC for operations supervision
      responsibilities.
 4                                                      AFI11-418_18WGSUP_I 13 JUNE 2013


        1.3.2. Where no definition is provided, “experienced” will be determined by the unit
        squadron commander and approved by OG/CC.
     1.4. (Added-18WG) 18 OG units, as referenced throughout this supplement, refers to all 18
     OG assigned units as well as expeditionary units that fall under the 18 EOG construct.
2. Functions:
     2.1. SOF. When on duty, the SOF is a group-level position and is the direct representative of
     the OG/CC. The SOF is the focal point for command and control of flight operations. OG/CC
     decision authority is delegated to this position to accomplish the mission.
        2.1.1. SOF is not required for rescue/weather/electronic attack/airlift/air refueling/special
        operations/deployed U-2 Ops. (For C2ISR, the OG/CC will determine if a SOF program
        is required. If a program is established this Instruction applies. At a minimum, C2ISR
        units will establish an Ops Sup/Top 3 program.)
        2.1.2. (Added-18WG) Supervisor of Flying Definition. For the purposes of this
        supplement, a Supervisor of Flying (SOF) is a fully qualified USAF Fighter Pilot capable
        of performing SOF duties for all Kadena AB (KAB) local fighter flying.
            2.1.2.1. (Added-18WG) SOF Candidates should be a fighter 4-ship flight lead or
            higher to be nominated for SOF duty. Highly experienced 2-ship flight leads may be
            nominated on a case-by-case basis. Attachment 5 outlines the 18 WG SOF Training
            Program.
     2.2. Ops Sup/Top 3. The squadron Ops Sup/Top 3 will only be filled by the following
     individuals: the squadron commander, the squadron operations officer, assistant operations
     officer(s), flight commanders, or other individuals deemed qualified by the squadron
     commander and approved by the OG/CC. ANG/AFRC: OG/CC or Air Operations Officer
     (AOO) will determine requirements for Ops Sup and will determine the appropriate
     personnel to fill the Ops Sup position. ANG/AFRC may combine SOF and Ops Sup duties.
        2.2.1. Squadron commander and operations officer decision authority may be delegated
        to this position to make operations-related decisions and recommendations.
3. Operations. This section identifies the minimum flying unit supervisory requirements
depending on types of operations involved. (Additional requirements can be defined in the unit
supplement).
     3.1. Types of Operations. The definitions for types of operations that are used in Table 1
     are:
        3.1.1. Daily Flying Operations. Normal or surge operations at the unit's home station
        (this does not include other types of operations defined below).
        3.1.2. On-Going Off Station Sorties. Missions/sorties that do not takeoff or land at
        home station.
        3.1.3. Deployed Operations. Flight operations away from home station that are part of
        a deployment, exercise or contingency.
        3.1.4. Scrambles. Aircraft launched on a scramble order from an alert posture.

                                                                      (ANG)
Notes:
        The SOF and Ops Sup may leave the unit operations complex (as defined by the unit
         supplement to this instruction) after aircraft depart the local area, workload permitting
         and will be immediately available by telephone, pager, radio or intercom. The SOF and
         Ops Sup will be at their duty locations 45 minutes prior to the estimated time of arrival of
         unit aircraft. For reduced flying operations the OG/CC may determine if a SOF is
         required. Reduced flying operations are defined as 4 or less fighter aircraft or 2 or less of
         the same type of non-fighter aircraft or, while adhering to these limitations for fighter and
         non-fighter aircraft, 6 total aircraft if 2 or more are RPA.
        For deployed operations, the detachment commander will coordinate with host base
         Operations Group for supervision requirements. This may involve integrating into the
         host base SOF and/or Ops Sup program.

        Must be immediately available by telephone, pager, radio, or intercom. (USAFE: Ops
         Sup for on-going off station sorties can be filled by an experienced aircrew member
         (SDO) as defined in the unit supplement.)

         3.2.1. (Added-18WG) An 18 OG SOF will be on duty at the SOF position in the KAB
         Control Tower during the normal 18 WG fighter flying window.
         3.2.2. (Added-18WG) SOF Scheduling Outside Normal Flying Window. Fighter
         squadron commanders are responsible for providing their own SOF for single-squadron
         flying outside the scheduled local fighter flying window.
 6                                                      AFI11-418_18WGSUP_I 13 JUNE 2013


        3.2.3. (Added-18WG) For fighter FCFs, a SOF is not required but the Ops Sup will be
        immediately available to assist the FCF pilot if a SOF is not in the tower. If no other
        fighters are airborne, a dedicated catcher’s mitt or chase ship is highly desired.
        3.2.4. (Added-18WG) Deployed Unit Squadron Operations Supervisors. Units flying
        local missions while deployed to Kadena will designate an Operations Supervisor(Ops
        Sup). Names and contact information for these Ops Supswill be forwarded to 18
        OSS/OSOS, Operations Wing Scheduling, with the daily flying schedule. During normal
        duty periods, Ops Sups will be immediately available with their appropriate aircraft flight
        manual and immediate action checklist. When directed by the SOF, Ops Sups will tune
        their radio to the SOF frequency (302.5) or single frequency approach frequency (290.3)
        and be prepared to offer the SOF and aircrew appropriate assistance.
4. Responsibilities: Note: For the purposes of this instruction, the terms “operations group
commander” (OG/CC), “squadron commander” (SQ/CC), and “director of operations” (SQ/DO)
also refer to their designated representatives.
     4.1. OG/CC (ANG/AFRC: OG/CC or AOO) will:
        4.1.1. Be responsible for the implementation, direction and execution of the Operations
        Supervision program.
        4.1.2. Be immediately available to the SOF or Ops Sup/Top 3 (if no SOF is either
        available or required based on the type of operation) for consultation during daily flying
        operations.
        4.1.3. Ensure tenant flying units use host/tenant memorandum of agreement
        (MOA)/letter of agreement (LOA) to avoid duplication of effort.
        4.1.4. Be the final approval authority for unit supplement to this instruction.
     4.2. SQ/CC (or equivalent) and/or SQ/DO will:
        4.2.1. Ensure a SOF/Ops Sup is on duty when required by Table 1
        4.2.2. Be available to the Ops Sup/Top 3 for consultation during flying operations.
     4.3. SOF will:
        4.3.1. Be on duty when required by Table 1 or as directed by the OG/CC.
           4.3.1.1. (Added-18WG) 18 OG Supervisor of Flying (SOF).
               4.3.1.1.1. (Added-18WG) The SOF will inform the 18th Operations Group
               Commander (18 OG/CC) or designated representative of all unusual situations,
               and if time permits, elevate command decisions with recommendations (e.g.
               cancellation of flying, diversion of aircraft, etc). If circumstances arise which do
               not permit notification of 18 OG/CC or designated representative, SOFs will take
               those actions necessary to permit safe recovery of aircraft and aircrew. SOFs may
               direct fighter squadrons to assign an additional SOF-qualified individual to the
               tower to assist with deteriorating situations. As a minimum, the SOF will notify
               18 OG/CC or his designated individual as soon as possible of the following

5. Handling of In-Flight Emergencies:
   5.1. The primary objective during an abnormal/emergency situation is the safe recovery of
   the aircrew and aircraft. When establishing procedures, units will consider:
      5.1.1. Providing a single, discrete frequency for recovering an emergency aircraft. ATC
      and the emergency aircrew should determine when to use a single frequency approach
      (SFA). The SOF will have access to the SFA. The SFA should be available to
      crash/fire/rescue personnel to monitor the recovery.
      5.1.2. Using the command post, or other capable agency, to notify all appropriate
      agencies and key personnel of an IFE and provide situation updates.
      5.1.3. Prioritizing actions during concurrent emergencies/abnormal situations.
      5.1.4. Authorizing direct communications (over discrete SOF or squadron common
      frequency) from the Ops Sup/Top 3 to an IFE aircrew. NOTE: Only ATC personnel may
      authorize direct communication over ATC frequencies, including the SFA frequency.
      However, this does not preclude the SOF and/or Ops Sup/Top 3 from using whatever
      communication necessary, to include GUARD and SFA, to prevent an unsafe situation
      that could immediately jeopardize safe recovery.
 14                                                   AFI11-418_18WGSUP_I 13 JUNE 2013


      5.1.5. That only the ground on-scene commander, normally the fire chief, can terminate
      an emergency.
      5.1.6. That the final decision during any IFE/abnormal situation rests with the aircraft
      commander. However, SOFs may declare an IFE for any aircraft based on their
      knowledge of the aircraft and the flight and airfield environment.
      5.1.7. Obtaining a chase ship for single ship emergency aircraft if time permits.
      5.1.8. If the SOF is not qualified in or technically knowledgeable of the aircraft with an
      IFE, then directing the Ops Sup/Top 3 or other highly experienced individual to report to
      the SOF's duty location during an abnormal situation/recovery if time permits.
   5.2. (Added-18WG) During an IFE, the SOF/Ops Sup/Top 3 will perform the functions
   outlined in AFI 11-418, Section 5 as appropriate.
   5.3. (Added-18WG) If the SOF determines an emergency should be declared, and the pilot
   has not declared, the SOF will declare an emergency and advise the pilot. This is particularly
   applicable to the following situations:
      5.3.1. (Added-18WG) Any aircraft malfunction requiring an arrestment or runway
      closure.
      5.3.2. (Added-18WG) Any situation that requires jettison of live ordnance, inert
      ordnance, or external stores.
      5.3.3. (Added-18WG) Any physiological incident.

   the Ops Sup will perform the functions outlined in AFI 11-418, Paragraphs 5.1.2, 5.1.3,
   5.1.4, 5.1.5, and 5.1.6.
   5.5. (Added-18WG) E-3 Handling of In-Flight Emergencies. During an E-3 IFE, E-3
   technical assistance will be provided by a Technical Representative (Tech Rep). The Tech
   Rep position will be manned by an Experienced Aircraft Commander or Experienced Flight
   Engineer. If the E-3 Ops Sup is not an experienced AC/FE, a Tech Rep will be scheduled.
   When required, the Tech Rep will be available via telephone (land-line or cellular) at all
   times during the scheduled flying period. The Tech Rep is responsible for providing
   technical assistance and recommendations as required in handling aircraft emergencies.
   5.6. (Added-18WG) HH-60 Handling of In-Flight Emergencies. During an HH-60 IFE, the
   Ops Sup will perform the functions outlined in AFI 11-418, Paragraphs 5.1.2, 5.1.3, 5.1.4,
   5.1.5, and 5.1.6.
   5.7. (Added-18WG) RC/WC-135 Handling of In-Flight Emergencies. During a RC/WC-
   135 IFE, a duty Instructor Pilot (IP) will be available to assist the Ops Sup and aircrew in the
   safe recovery of the aircraft. When required, the duty IP will be available via telephone

6. SOF Guidance. Unless noted otherwise, this guidance applies to the Ops Sup/Top 3 when a
SOF is either unavailable or not used.
   6.1. SOF/ATC Relationship:
AFI11-418_18WGSUP_I 13 JUNE 2013                                                             15


     6.1.1. The separation and sequencing of traffic are the responsibilities of ATC. Unless
     safety is an issue, the SOF will work directly with the watch supervisor. To promote
     effective and efficient flight operations, the SOF may suggest, based on knowledge of the
     flying schedule and unique circumstances of individual missions, actions that affect ATC
     concerns or desires.
     6.1.2. Except in an emergency, the SOF will not transmit over ATC frequencies without
     prior coordination with ATC (this does not apply to dedicated SOF frequencies). All
     radio transmissions to a distressed aircrew, from other than the SOF or ATC, will be
     coordinated through the SOF (this does not apply to the Ops Sup/Top3 if communicating
     to the aircrew via a squadron common frequency).
  6.2. Duty Hours:
     6.2.1. Prior to beginning supervisory duties, the SOF will meet crew rest requirements as
     directed by AFI 11-202 Volume 3, General Flight Rules, as supplemented.
        6.2.1.1. (Added-18WG) Maximum SOF Tour. The maximum SOF duty day is 12
        hours, day or night, unless waived by 18 OG/CC IAW AFI 11-418, Section 6.2.
        6.2.1.2. (Added-18WG) SOF tours will be scheduled to be no more than eight hours
        in length during normal 18 WG flying operations, and ten hours in length during
        exercises/contingency operations. The OG/CC may waive tour length up to 12 hours
        IAW AFI 11-418, Section 6.2.
        6.2.1.3. (Added-18WG) The closing SOF is scheduled to have a minimum of one
        hour of additional duty day remaining beyond the expected end of the tour in order to
        provide SOF coverage for diverts, late landings, or other unforeseen events.
     6.2.2. Maximum duty day for SOF is 16 hours with a limit of 12 hours performing SOF
     duties. The OG/CC is waiver authority and may extend a SOF duty day up to 16 hours
     on a case-by-case basis. (AFGSC Missile Wings: For alert and scramble operations, the
     SOF maximum duty day is 24 hrs as long as alert/sleeping facilities are readily available).
     6.2.3. The SOF will be at the prescribed duty location IAW Table 1 NLT 30 minutes
     prior to first takeoff in order to complete required duties in paragraph 4.3
  6.3. Duty Location:

   problems through stan/eval channels to their MAJCOM stan/eval function. The MAJCOM
   stan/eval function will ensure the Lead MAJCOM is informed so that CONFERENCE
   HOTEL information can be updated.
   7.3. If units discover updated CONFERENCE HOTEL contact information different from
   the information in this guidance, they will immediately verify the corrected information and
   forward it via email through NAF/MAJCOM stan/eval channels to ACC/A3TV (no AF Form
   847 required).

   8.13. ANG/AFRC: Establish procedures for other highly qualified individuals to assist with
   SOF and Ops Sup/Top 3 duties and responsibilities if required during times when one
   supervisor is covering both SOF and Ops Sup/Top 3 positions.
9. Special provisions for ANG/AFRC and smaller than wing-sized units (e. g. GSUs).
   9.1. If a unit operates from a location with another organization (i.e., tenant unit), integration
   into host unit supervisory program should be attempted if operations are compatible. These
   procedures will be implemented through LOAs/MOAs.
   9.2. At the discretion of the OG/CC (or equivalent), more than one supervisory position may
   be covered by a single supervisor. The responsibilities of the SOF position take priority over
   all other duties and a single Ops Sup will be SOF certified.

           18 WG SUPERVISOR OF FLYING (SOF) TRAINING PROGRAM

A5.1. (Added-18WG) General.
   A5.1.1. (Added-18WG) The 18 WG SOF represents the 18 OG/CC. His/her judgment,
   standards, directions, and advisories will greatly affect the safety and efficiency of flying
   operations. All SOFs must be aware of the limited options available at an island location
   such as Kadena, and when in doubt regarding decisions affecting flying operations, select the
   most conservative option consistent with Operational Risk Management.
   A5.1.2. (Added-18WG) The guidance, instructions, and directives contained in AFI11-
   418_18WGSUP, the SOF book, aircraft technical orders, checklists, and local in-flight
   guides are valuable tools which supplement the SOF’s experience and decision-making
   abilities. SOFs have full authority to act on behalf of the 18 OG/CC. However,
   communications and time permitting, the SOF should consult with the 18 OG/CC or 18
   OG/CDF on critical items. Although the final authority and responsibility for the aircraft
   rests with the pilot in command, the SOF should not hesitate to recommend or take actions
   that would improve overall flying safety.
A5.2. (Added-18WG) SOF Qualification Program.
   A5.2.1. (Added-18WG) Candidates should be a fighter 4-ship flight lead or higher to be

                         TYPHOON EVACUATION CHECKLIST

Figure A7.1. Typhoon Evacuation Checklist
1. Upon direction from the 18 OG/CC, the 909 ARS/CC and the 44 & 67 FS/CCs will initiate
   planning for a possible typhoon evacuation involving 18 WG KC-135 and F-15C aircraft.
   The 909 ARS and 44/67 FS operations supervisors (Ops Sup) will establish lines of
   communication at the earliest opportunity to ensure planning details are passed first-hand.
   The following guidance will allow for maximum efficiency in coordinating and executing the
   movement within a constrained planning window (less than 5 days):

   a. Submit Altitude Reservation (ALTRV) Approval Request
                  i. 44/67 FS & 909 ARS Ops Sup will confer and decide on a routing,
                     altitude block and times to request for the movement.
                  ii.        The FS Ops Sup will submit the ALTRV APREQ to Pacific
                     Military Altitude Reservation Function (PACMARF), including the name
                     and rank of a Project Officer (PO) that is available for contact 24 hours a
                     day.
                  iii.       The ALTRV APREQ will be submitted NLT 48 hours prior to
                     launch. The normal lead time for an APREQ is 6 working days; however,
                     PACMARF can quick-turn requests when typhoon evacuations are in
                     effect.
                  iv.        The PO should emphasize to PACMARF that movement is part of
                     typhoon evacuation operations and any changes to the ALTRV
                     request/approval need to be communicated to the PO immediately in order
                     to avoid last-minute changes.

   b. Schedule Local Airspace and Coordinate with ATC
                 i. 18 OSS/DO will coordinate with the FS Ops Sup to schedule local
                    airspace (i.e. W-173) and have it available during launch window as the
                    back-up to an ALTRV.
                 ii.       18 OSS/DO will also advise the OSS Controllers in Naha of an
                    impending fighter movement so they can serve as primary liaisons with
                    Naha ATC during execution.

   c. Prepare for Alternate Movement Plan
                  i. The 909 ARS & 44/67 FS Ops Sup will mission plan a contingency
                     movement without an ALTRV in case the APREQ is not granted in time
                     or unforeseen circumstances cause the ALTRV to be cancelled by ATC.
                  ii.        This alternate plan will be based on a rendezvous in local airspace,
                     top-off A/R for the fighters, then continuing IFR to destination as a single
                     flight.
                  iii.       Both units will have 1801 flight plans ready to file at a moment’s
                     notice that includes all applicable aircraft tail numbers for movement as a
                     standard formation.

                    iv.       An attempt should be given to requesting a block altitude for part
                      of the routing which may alleviate the need for additional airspace closer
                      to the destination.

   d. KC-135 Cargo
                 i. All cargo will be ready to load NLT 24 hours prior to departure.

2. The Supervisor of Flying (SOF) will be the 18 OG/CC’s point-man for execution of the
   planned movement. The SOF will have this COA readily available and ensure that both the
   tanker and fighter Ops Sups have lines of communication established (land line, cell phone,
   radio) prior to any ground movement. Using the following information, the SOF will also
   make contact with OSS Controllers in Naha prior to execution in order to more quickly
   resolve last minute issues with ATC.

                  e.   909 ARS Ops: 634-8060     (Tiger Ops – 276.4)
                  f.   44 FS Ops:   634-1831     (Bat Ops – 261.0)
                  g.   67 FS Ops:   634-1871     (Cock Ops – 234.8)
                  h.   18 OG SOF: 634-1810       (Shogun 10 – 302.5)
                  i.   18 OSS Naha: 634-4647/4677

3. If the ALTRV falls out or other ATC issues prevent departure per the primary plan, the SOF
   will immediately contact all parties for execution of the alternate movement plan. The SOF
   will be responsible for this coordination and ensure aircraft commanders and flight leads are
   kept informed prior to departure.
