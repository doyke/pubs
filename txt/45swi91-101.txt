SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Current revision updated this instruction to address: changes in document references;
management responsibility of Launch Complex – 17 (LC-17) being transferred from NASA back
to the USAF and LC-17 being placed on the demolition list; covered PSM commodities at the
National Reconnaissance Office’s (NRO) Eastern Processing Facility (EPF); 45 SW
organizational changes including one that removed the need for the 45th Range Management
Squadron (45 RMS) to have any PSM responsibilities; removed maximum quantities of covered
chemicals listed in table A2.1, Attachment 2. The intent of Table A2.1 is to show what sites
have covered chemicals in excess of Process Safety Management thresholds. The maximum
allowed quantities of the chemicals listed in table A2.1 can be found in the respective site plans.
Additionally, the paragraph structure was change to better reflect organizational responsibilities.

Previous revision (19 Feb 10) updated the instruction to include the impacts of deactivating the
1st Space Launch Squadron (1 SLS) and the discontinuation of the Joint Base Operations and
Support Contract (J-BOSC); Launch Complex – 17 (LC-17) being transferred to NASA; and the
Fuel Storage Area – 1 (FSA-1) operations had moved from J-BOSC, a joint USAF/NASA
contract, to the Infrastructure Services Contract. Consequently, PSM responsibility for LC-17
and FSA-1 has transferred from 45 SW to NASA. Quantities of covered chemicals listed in
Attachment 2, Table A2.1 were updated.

1. Purpose. This instruction describes how 45 SW and USAF tenant organizations shall comply
with AFI 91-203 regarding PSM covered chemicals, and it constitutes the 45 SW PSM
Compliance Implementation Plan.
     1.1. Application.
        1.1.1. This instruction is applicable to all 45 SW organizations involved with PSM
        covered processes at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) or Patrick AFB
        (PAFB). Currently, there are no PSM covered processes at Patrick AFB.
        1.1.2. This instruction is not applicable to tenant organizations or commercial companies
        that have operational control over a PSM covered process. They are required by law
        (29 CFR 1910.119) to develop their own compliant PSM programs; however, if they
        have PSM covered processes at CCAFS or PAFB, they are encouraged under this
        instruction to have representation on the 45 SW PSM Team.
45SWI91-101 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                 3


       1.1.3. 45 SW’s Weapons Safety Office (45 SW/SEW) has regulatory safety compliance
       responsibility for explosives and pyrotechnics materials at PAFB and CCAFS. They
       ensure compliance with the requirements in paragraph 46.2 of AFI 91-203 regarding
       explosives and pyrotechnics by implementing the requirements in AFI 91-202, Chapter 9,
       The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, and AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety
       Standards. This includes routine explosive safety inspections to users of explosives and
       pyrotechnics are in compliance with locally-developed Explosive Safety Plans derived
       from Department of Defense Explosive Safety Board Explosives Site Plans and Licenses.
       1.1.4. Attachment 2, Table A2.1, contains a list of the PSM covered chemicals currently
       located at CCAFS. The list includes chemicals covered by the PSM regulation and those
       included in an 11 March 1996 memo from HQ USAF/SE.
       1.1.5. 45 SW personnel requiring information, support or written PSM certification from
       booster, payload or range contractors shall coordinate with and obtain the information
       through the responsible Program Office (i.e., 45 LCG, 45 CES/CEZ, 45 CONS) or the
       applicable off-site System Program Office, and not directly from any contractor. The
       Contract Management Office shall ensure proper PSM requirements and provisions are
       contained in each contract and should encourage contractors involved with covered
       processes to participate in 45 SW PSM team activities.

Notes:

1. By direction from Air Force Space Command, covered chemicals and processes shall be as
described in the memo from HQ USAF/SE, dated 11 March 1996. The position of Air Force Space
Command is that all hypergolic fuels (in excess of threshold quantity) and open grain ammonium
perchlorate, in addition to other chemicals on the OSHA covered list, are processes covered by the
PSM regulation.

2. FSA-1 and EPF are owned by NASA and NRO respectively and operated by their respective
contractors. On-site inventories are provided here because these sites are located on Air Force
property.

3. Per AFSPC/SE directive, threshold quantities for hypergolic fuels that are not on the OSHA list will
be the same as for methyl hydrazine (100 pounds), thus, the threshold quantity for Hydrazine (N2H4) is
100 pounds.
 12                                                       45SWI91-101 20 NOVEMBER 2013


4. Hydrogen is covered under 29 CFR 1910.119 (a) (ii), a process which involves a flammable liquid
or gas on site in one location, in a quantity of 10,000 pounds (4535.9 kg) or more when not used solely
for workplace consumption as a fuel.

5. No covered chemicals are used in the LPF, but that is subject to change.

6. The maximum allowed quantities of the chemicals listed in this table can be found in the respective
site plans.
45SWI91-101 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                   13
