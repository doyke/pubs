function. This manual applies to the Inventory Management Specialists (IMS), Equipment
Specialists (ES), Production Management Specialists (PMS), and Logistic Managers (LM), at all
AFMC field units (except Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group [AMARG] and the
USAF Medical Center, WPAFB). This policy does not apply to the US Air Force Reserve or Air
National Guard units or members. Refer recommended changes and questions about this
publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using an AF Form 847,

                            POLICY AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Applicability. This manual applies to Headquarters (HQ) Air Force Materiel Command
(AFMC), the Air Logistics Centers (ALC), the Air Force Global Logistics Support Center
(AFGLSC), Hanscom Cyber/Netcentric Cryptologic Systems Division (ESC/HNC), and the Air
Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC) at Kirkland AFB, and) personnel responsible for
development, adjustment, computation, review, and approval of requirements for equipment
items and management actions that result from those requirements. Procedures contained in this
manual apply primarily to Inventory Management Specialists (IMS), Equipment Specialists (ES),
Production Management Specialists (PMS), Logistics Managers (LM) and ALC management.
Henceforth, any reference to ALC will encompass all ALCs, ESC/HNC, and AFNWC.
1.2. Purpose. This manual implements AFPD 23-1, Materiel Management Policy and
Procedures, and explains how the requirements portions of the Air Force equipment
management systems operate. The Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS)/C001,
the Classified Equipment Requirements Computation System (CERC)/D039 and the
Requirements Management System (RMS) Equipment Item Process (EIP)/D200C support this
function. This manual provides basic guidelines for computing requirements for equipment
items.
   1.2.1. Equipment items are separate, primary, end items (other than the weapon system
   itself) needed by an individual or organization to perform an assigned mission. Equipment
   items have been known by many terms (end items, replacement items, automatic test
   equipment, etc.) and are items that normally do not lose their identity when in use. They are
   easily identified by their Expendability, Recoverability, Reparability, Category (ERRC)
   codes of NF* and ND*.
       1.2.1.1. NF* (ERRC ―U‖) = non-expendable, reparable (field level), recoverable (repair
       and reuse).
       1.2.1.2. ND* (ERRC ―S‖) = non-expendable, reparable (depot level), recoverable. Note:
       The asterisk denotes the third position of the ERRC designator that is known as the
       Equipment Management Code (EMC). The EMC designates the level of accountability.
       Refer to AFMAN23-110, Volume (V)2, Part (P)2, C3, Attachment 3A-5 (at
       http://www.e-
       publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/PUBS/AF/23/23011002/020203/020203.pdf)
       for additional explanation.
   1.2.2. Other items reported as in-use substitutes for any of these items will be included in the
   computation only to the extent of their reported use. All centrally acquired ND* and NF*
   items, common and peculiar, standard and developmental except Federal Supply Class (FSC)
   8115 and 8145, with a Materiel Management Aggregation Code (MMAC) of AN, AP, AS,
   CN, PQ, or TE (engine containers); FSC 3510 (laundry and dry cleaning equipment); and
   PU, XV, XW, XX, XY and XZ must be included in the requirements computation system.
   1.2.3. This manual only addresses equipment item requirements that are assigned an ERRC
   ―S‖ or ―U‖ and a Procurement Source Code (PSC) 5.

1.3. Authority. The 405th Supply Chain Management Squadron’s Materiel Support Flight
(SCMS/GULA) acts as the Support Equipment (SE) functional Office of Primary Responsibility
(OPR) for equipment requirements and procedures. The 405 SCMS/GULA is comprised of
Requirements Control Officers (RCOs), Equipment OPRs and AFMC Equipment OPRs.
Henceforth, any reference to 405 SCMS/GULA will encompass one or more of these functions.
1.4. Type of Items.
   1.4.1. Investment Centrally Procured Equipment is defined as a unit/system cost of $250K
   and above, or is considered exempt from being managed under the Support Equipment (SE)
   Transformation Initiative. Cost is only one criterion of exemption. Other criteria include
   Automatic Test System (ATS), missile (Budget Program [BP] 22) SE, weapon (BP35) SE
   items, vehicles (BP 82), and SE items peculiar to the Program Executive Office (PEO)
   programs, as well as a specific list of items from the Office of the Secretary of Defense
   (OSD). Items that meet one or more of these criteria are exempt regardless of cost. The list
   of excluded NSNs is posted to the Centrally Managed Support Equipment Requirements
   Policies     and      Procedures   Community      of     Practice   (CoP)     located     at
   https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=OO-RQ-MC-16.                The
   following central procurement appropriations will be used to procure investment SE (for the
   specific criteria see AFI 65-601, Vol 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures (at http://www.e-
   publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFI65-601V1.pdf):
       1.4.1.1. 3010: Aircraft Procurement;
       1.4.1.2. 3011: Procurement of Ammunitions;
       1.4.1.3. 3020: Missile Procurement;
       1.4.1.4. 3080: Other Procurement; and
       1.4.1.5. 3600: Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E).
   1.4.2. Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Centrally Procured Equipment is any SE item
   not exempted by the above mentioned criteria, having a unit/system cost of under $250K.
   Equipment in this category is managed under the SE transformation initiative. Only 3400,
   O&M, Element of Expense Investment Code (EEIC) 638, funds will be used to procure
   O&M centrally procured SE.
1.5. Equipment Control. The Air Force (AF) Equipment Management process is supported by
three major equipment systems that perform the majority of the functions or provide the majority
of the data required for equipment requirements. They are the AFEMS/C001, CERC/D039, and
the Requirements Management System (RMS) Equipment Item Process (EIP)/D200C.
   1.5.1. AFEMS provides audit trail accounting for all equipment assets in the AF and feeds
   the authorization/asset data to D039. In addition, it hosts the Equipment Requirements
   System (ERS), which consolidates requirement and asset data from AFEMS, the computed
   net requirement from D200C, and backorder data from D035 to develop an Enterprise,
   prioritized list of ―holes.‖ The Major Commands (MAJCOM) will convey ―urgency of need‖
   to the IMS and the IMS will convey support plans and problems to the MAJCOM.
   1.5.2. The D039 uses programmed logic to compute requirements and passes the computed
   requirement as mechanical language to D200C.
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                      13


   1.5.3. The D200C, not to be confused as the computation system, converts the requirement
   to a readable format and provides capability for on-line review and file maintenance.
1.6. Computation Purpose.
1.6.1. Economic Consideration. Consistent with AF policy, the requirements system is
designed to ensure the best materiel support readiness and operational capability at minimum
expense. This is done by combining minimum essential authorization data with maximum
useable asset data to determine a realistic net item requirement. Although all of the techniques
used in the requirements system are discussed in this instruction, some of the more prominent
economic considerations are:
       1.6.1.1. Use of precisely screened, edited, and updated minimum essential authorization
       data reported by AFBs and MAJCOMs through AFEMS.
       1.6.1.2. Economic application, alignment, and allocation of useable assets which takes
       into consideration the item preferred, cost, location, need date, priority of user, and
       condition of asset.
       1.6.1.3. Incorporation of multiple or integrated management concepts to simultaneously
       develop acquisition plans, budget estimates, interservice utilization and disposition data,
       requirements inventory analysis reports, candidates for contract termination, retention
       levels, disposal quantities, and master repair schedule data.
   1.6.2. Management and Support Decisions. The computation is only one of the segments
   associated in the equipment management process. The computation is generally the basis for
   decisions and actions used by most ALC IMSs when they are determining item net
   requirements, procurement plans and budget estimates. Also, the computation provides data
   for management decisions pertaining to: contract termination; disposal quantities; inventory
   analysis report; support capability studies; end item phased population program; and item
   management controls, reports, and stock distribution. The IMS uses all aspects of data
   reflected in the computation to determine item management control actions and determine the
   degree of support for current, new, or future requirements.
1.7. Computation Cycles. The equipment item requirements computation is accomplished four
times each Fiscal Year (FY) with the ―as of‖ dates 31 Dec, 31 Mar, 30 Jun, and 30 Sep. The
computations that are run in the March and September cycles are referred to as semiannual
computations. The other two cycles (Jun and Dec) are normally called quarterly cycles. File
maintenance capability varies depending on cycle and timing. See Table 13.5 for the applicable
computation cycle code.
1.8. Product Retention. The IMS must retain the Mar and Sep computations, related products,
and supporting documentation for the current cycle plus four cycles of Mar and Sep (two-year
period). The Jun and Dec computational products must be retained until the next Mar/Sep
computation is received. Item Managers are not required to retain paper products of items that
required no corrections and/or documentation. Products applicable to these items are available
via on-line display. This does not alleviate the need to retain all documentation to support
computed requirements or to provide products when requested. The ultimate goal is to minimize
the retention of paper products. Comprehensive documentation of file maintenance via the
D200C notepad will assist in achieving this goal.
 14                                                            AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011


Example is:
   1.8.1. Current Mar Cycle:          Mar 10 Initial/update.
   1.8.2. Current Sep Cycle:          Sep 09 update.
   1.8.3. Four Cycles:         Mar 09 update; Sep 08 update; Mar 08 update; and Sep 07 update.
1.9. Requirements Management. The requirements computation, while important, is only one
of the tools for effective equipment management. The requirements computation system will
provide the basis for making many decisions on the total scope of item management efforts.
Keep requirements computation in the proper perspective; make a distinction between a factual
statement of requirements and the ability to fund these requirements from available resources.
Do not adjust the requirements computation to arrive at a preconceived figure which cannot be
substantiated by the most severe application of authorization, program, and asset data.
   1.9.1. There are times when changes to a United States Air Force (USAF) Program Directive
   (PD) occur too late for standard reporting through AFEMS. These changes must be supplied
   to the appropriate ALC IMS directly from the MAJCOM or LM. As a result, the IMS will
   make mechanical changes to requirement plans and equipment item budgets to support the
   off-line requirements. The D039 will apply assets to all initial requirements before allocating
   assets to satisfy replacement requirements. However, as the enterprise-level IMS, it may be
   necessary to satisfy a replacement requirement before all of the initial requirements are
   satisfied. All pertinent information (i.e., need date, urgency of need, fill rate, etc.) will be
   considered when making enterprise-level management decisions.
   1.9.2. The equipment IMS will buy the most economical quantity of SE within the
   computed/authorized requirement that can reasonably be procured to support worldwide
   (WW) support equipment needs. The IMS will work closely with the appropriate contracting
   personnel to acquire price comparison/evaluation data to support all economical buy
   considerations.
   1.9.3. SE/Equipment Procurement Planning Criteria.
       1.9.3.1. Review the buy year, budget year, and out-years requirements to be supported.
       1.9.3.2. Consider the firmness of all your requirements by assessing the risk of rapidly
       changing technology, weapon system reprogramming efforts, unprogrammed
       requirements, and the current priority for all outstanding equipment requirements.
   1.9.4. Replacement program quantities will be bought out as soon as possible, considering
   total equipment requirement priorities.
   1.9.5. The justification and logic to support economic equipment buys and the economic buy
   quantity will be input on the Notepad in D200C.
   1.9.6. Certain types of equipment cannot be procured in economic quantities because of
   special considerations such as: budget program funding and quantity constraints; unique
   warehousing; contractor production limitations; military construction projects scheduling;
   excessive handling and second destination transportation cost, and others; therefore,
   equipment procurement planning will reflect the evaluation of all known impacts.
   1.9.7. SE requirements are procured only against authorizations, but actual buy requirements
   may be smaller quantities. However, in those situations where economical SE buys can be
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                   15


   made, do so. The bottom line is support of mission essential requirements while also
   economizing on equipment procurements whenever it is reasonable and does not negatively
   impact the AF enterprise level.
1.10. D200C File Maintenance. The objective of the D200C is to provide quality products that
will integrate the processing of all centrally procured equipment item data. The equipment
subsystem provides the capability to perform on-line file maintenance of Item Manager Control
Data (IMCD), Interchangeability and Substitutability (I&S) Restructuring, Reported Assets and
Requirements (RAR), and Weapon System (WS) data, along with notepad capability to annotate
file maintenance actions and document critical management information. Attachment 4 of this
guide provides a detailed file maintenance checklist that will walk an IMS through each area of
the computation that will be reviewed. Note: It is strongly recommended to utilize the file
maintenance checklist as it equates to more comprehensive and complete file maintenance.
Attachment 5 provides the required signature levels.

Note 1: Adding an NSN and all its data can only be accomplished during the I&S
Restructure file maintenance window at the beginning of each cycle. It is also accomplished
in the IMCD file maintenance screens.

Note 2: During the RAR and WS file maintenance windows, the bulk of the file
maintenance actions are accomplished. The IMCD file maintenance screens are also
available during both of these windows; however, NSNs cannot be added.
1.11. Index of Actions. The Index of Actions (IA) is a product which summarizes the results of
an equipment item computation cycle. Its purpose is to furnish the item manager with a road
map as to the sequence in which their computations will be reviewed. The IA can be obtained in
a variety of ways: push product, display, or report. There are four basic IAs that can be obtained
from RMS: Basic, Descending Dollar sequence, SGM with I&S sequence and SGM sequence.
The indexes may be obtained from RMS anytime after the data is loaded. The IA contains NSNs
which have computed termination, buy, budget, budget+1, excess and/or retention quantities.
The basic hardcopy IA is automatically generated each cycle after the D039 computed
requirements are loaded in D200C.
1.12. Recommended Work Sequence for Scrubbing Computations. All D039/D200C
computations and ERS will be reviewed for any necessary file maintenance actions; however,
due to time constraints, the IMS will use the IA, in conjunction with their Asset Distribution List
(ADL) or Stock Control and Distribution (SC&D)/D035 Backorder List, to determine a
manageable scope of items to be scrubbed and file maintained as applicable.
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                       17


1.12.1. It is recommended that items be scrubbed based on the following categories and in the
sequence identified:
       1.12.1.1. Work the SGMs with ―Terminations‖ beginning with the item with the most
       backorders and the highest termination dollar value.
       1.12.1.2. Work the SGMs with ―Buys‖ beginning with the item with the most
       ―critical/important‖ backorders and the highest Buy dollar value.
       1.12.1.3. Work the SGMs with ―Budget‖ only requirements beginning with the most
       ―critical/important‖ backorders and the highest Budget dollar value.
       1.12.1.4. Work the SGMs with ―Budget +1‖ only requirement beginning with the most
       ―critical/important‖ backorders and the highest Budget+1 dollar value.
       1.12.1.5. Work the SGMs with ―Excess‖ requirements beginning with the item with the
       most backorders and the highest Excess dollar value.
       1.12.1.6. Work the SGMs with ―Retention‖ requirements beginning with the item with
       the most backorders and the highest Retention dollar value.
Note: Don’t forget to review the SGMs in ―Optimum‖ position that have backorders. Based on
the item’s total dollar value on backorder, work these in conjunction with the items computing
buys. Applicable signature levels can be found in Attachment 5 of this manual.
   1.12.2. A first glance at the IA can often show where major problems exist, such as an
   erroneous budget control code, unusually high/low quantities, or unusually high/low dollars
   by individual item. As you work the items, annotate the IA with the correct quantities and
   any information which briefly explains what is happening.
   1.12.3. Periodically, the 405 SCMS/GULA will run a File Maintenance Quality Checker:
       1.12.3.1. The first tab will consist of NSNs with a Buy, Budget, Term or Excess in the
       current comp cycle with possible erroneous data. The remarks block will summarize the
       potential error.
       1.12.3.2. The second tab will provide all details of the NSN (Last Modified, O&M
       Exclusion, Budget Code (BC), Budget Program Activity Code (BPAC), Materiel
       Program Code (MPC), Non-Procurable Status, Acquisition Advice Code (AAC),
       Replacement Criteria Code (RCC), Replacement Factor (RF), Administrative Lead Time
       (ALT), Production Lead Time (PLT), D200C Standard (Std) Price, D200C Date of Last
       Procurement (DOLP), ERS DOLP, ERS Std Price, Security Code, Total Acquired,
       Funded on Order, Unit Cost and quantity (QTY) for Buy-Bud Years, etc.)
       1.12.3.3. The third tab will explain each error remark and provide possible course of
       action needed to correct the erroneous data.
   1.12.4. Once the June/December file maintenance cycle is loaded, the March/September
   cycle(s) will become the alternate cycles in the file maintenance region. Therefore, there will
   be plenty of time to continue the review and file maintenance of the items in excess and
   retention. High dollar excess and retention affect the amount of funding received for new
   procurements, so it is important to review and dispose of all unnecessary inventories.

1.13. Equipment Requirements System (ERS). ERS is a web-based system that is hosted on
AFEMS. It is utilized for non-vehicular item procurement information updates, automated
equipment requirements prioritization and requirements planning. It is the tool used for
collaboration with the MAJCOMs and the linchpin in the success of the SE Transformation
Initiative. File maintenance capability of this information is available at all times within ERS.
Therefore, anytime new procurement information is received relating to a NSN’s Unit Cost,
Source of Unit Cost and the DOLP, it will be entered into ERS. This process allows for a degree
of workload alleviation, in that the IMS is no longer constrained to file maintaining multiple
inputs of this nature during a constricted file maintenance window. Periodically, the price
information from ERS is pushed to D200C for a mass update.
1.14. Responsibilities:
   1.14.1. HQ AFMC/A4RM is responsible for developing and instituting policy guidance for
   computing equipment item requirements.
   1.14.2. The 405th Supply Chain Management Squadron (SCMS) will:
       1.14.2.1. Coordinate and adhere to policy guidance for determining requirements.
       1.14.2.2. Initiate management improvements. Ask for revisions to AFEMS/ERS/C001,
       D039, and D200C systems, as required, to do these improvements. Input all C4 Systems
       Requirements Documents (CSRDs) to resolve system problems.
       1.14.2.3. Control submission of acquisition plans, budget estimates, and management
       products.
       1.14.2.4. Help in resolving any system or individual item problems which cannot be
       solved at the ALC level.
       1.14.2.5. Provide input to training personnel for the indoctrination and training of
       D039/D200C personnel on data input to D200C (tables, indexes, etc.) and use of output
       products. Provide periodic workshops if necessary.
       1.14.2.6. Maintain AFMCMAN 23-4 and forward publication change requests to HQ
       AFMC/A4RM.
       1.14.2.7. Furnish D200C input and output schedules to the ALCs.
       1.14.2.8. Determine and develop format of input data and output.
       1.14.2.9. Verify and update tables, codes, factors, formats, etc. for D200C/ERS.
       1.14.2.10. Push ERS Price Update reports to D200C at minimum once a cycle at the end
       to provide updated price information prior to the start of the next computation cycle.
       However, during the March and September Update cycles, while IMSs are scrubbing the
       computations in preparation for the Buy Spend Plan, Budget Submissions, and DD1000
       Requirements and Inventory Analysis Report (RIAR), it is strongly suggested the prices
       are pushed twice a month.
       1.14.2.11. Push the ERS Unfunded Quantity Report from ERS to D200C after the Buy
       List is finalized.
       1.14.2.12. Periodically pull data from D200C, ERS, and D035, compile and analyze it,
       and create and publish a report, identifying conflicting data elements.
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                  19

       1.14.11.4. Host the budget review.
       1.14.11.5. Produce the budget post-review brochure.
1.15. IMS, LM and ES Relationship. While AFMC functional requirements hold the IMS
responsible for adequate and timely support of assigned items, the LM is assigned the same
responsibility for individual weapon and support systems, and the ES is assigned the
responsibility to ensure the replacement requirements and factors used in the computation
process are accurate. The IMS is responsible for the aggregation, review, update, and approval
of all weapon system input data with regard to completeness and accuracy. The ES is
responsible for providing the IMS with the replacement methodology, usage, rates, and factors to
be used in the computation of equipment requirements. Coordination between the IMS, LM and
ES is essential to make sure current and future weapon and support systems are fully supported
on a timely basis. This coordination prevents the duplication of requirements by LM, IMS, and
ES, or by standard system input versus non-standard factors and IMS additive input.
1.16. Management by Item and by Weapon/Support System. To facilitate materiel
management actions required by both the IMS and LM, requirements for equipment items are
computed to a net by organization, by base, by MAJCOM, and by weapon and support system.
Net requirements, so developed, are shown for each subgroup (computation group) within the
Interchangeability and Substitutability Group (I&SG).
1.17. Management Team Intervention. The Management Team (LM, ES, IMS, PMS, and
buyer) will not consider the mechanical determination of requirements as a perfect mathematical
application and summation of data. Judgment, practical knowledge, and experience acquired by
the team members, customer, and manufacturer must be considered in determining valid and
justifiable requirements. The management team will use these considerations to analyze and
refine quantities generated by system factors, programs, and data elements. The IMS must
consider the impact adjustments would have on the requirements computation. All changes to
reported data will be completely justified and documented in the Notepad with source documents
placed in file to support these actions. These source documents must be retained for as long as
the computation is retained.
1.18. Requirements Data. Basic data used in determining gross materiel requirements is:
   1.18.1. Authorized Equipment Data. Equipment data is managed under AFMAN 23-110,
   V4, and input to the C001. All personnel considering changes to the reported authorization
   data must clearly understand the difference between maximum quantities allowed in the
   Allowance Standards (AS) and the minimum quantities established as authorizations from
   these ASs.
   1.18.2. IMS and LM Additive Data. The IMS/LM will retain serviceable and supportable
   support equipment to fill anticipated unprogrammed requirements with documentation and
   justification. Rationale for retention of excess assets includes, holding assets for an expected
   requirement; holding assets to support reclamation program(s); offering assets to other
   services; or, offering assets to Foreign Military Sales (FMS) programs. If this rationale does
   not apply, the IMS will review the assets for potential disposal action.
   1.18.3. Replacement Data. The IMS and ES are jointly responsible for replacement
   requirements; they will closely coordinate their activities in this area. In general, the ES will
   indicate the replacement criteria code to be used. The replacement criteria code indicates the
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                     25


  method/procedure that will be used to compute the replacement quantities. Some of the
  methods use replacement factors to mechanically calculate the replacement requirement for
  each program position across the Fiscal Year Defense Plan (FYDP). Zero factors will be
  entered for any item that is maintained on the component basis rather than being condemned
  and replaced in its entirety. Specific instructions on the entry and processing of replacement
  criteria codes, factors and other related data are in Chapter 3 (reference Table 13.18 for
  replacement criteria codes definitions).
     1.18.3.1. Personnel involved in choosing/changing the method to be used to compute the
     replacement program must understand all assets are not incorporated in the replacement
     requirements calculations. The following will not be considered in replacement
     programs: excess assets; retention assets; funded/on order assets; assets applied or
     allocated to War Readiness Materiel (WRM) requirements; replacement requirements
     (including manually computed replacement programs); and requirements citing special
     Allowance Source Codes (ASCs) 000, 000A, 014, 044, 047, 048, 049, 050, 052, 053,
     054, 055, 057, 064, 068, 076, 985, 986, and 987. Reference AFMAN 23-110, V2, P2,
     C22,             Attachment             22L-1             (at            http://www.e-
     publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/PUBS/AF/23/23011002/020222/020222.pdf)
     for ASC descriptions.
     1.18.3.2. There are six methods of computing replacement requirements:
         1.18.3.2.1. The standard method computes replacement requirements by application
         of the replacement factor, adjusted by a time factor, against the anticipated in-use
         assets. When adequate condemnation and in-use history data are available, the factor
         will be machine generated.
         1.18.3.2.2. When adequate condemnation and in-use history data are not available or
         the resulting factor is unrealistic, the IM and ES may decide to manually compute the
         factor. The logic used to compute the factor will be filed and reference to the
         documentation annotated on the Notepad.
         1.18.3.2.3. The Projected Usage and Life Expectancy (PULE) procedure forecasts
         future condemnation quantities.
             1.18.3.2.3.1. It is based on the known age of the assets, the projected life
             expectancy, and the probability of condemnation. When these data elements and
             the appropriate replacement criteria code are entered, D039 will mechanically
             compute replacement requirements. This process is most effective when
             condemnation history is limited and assets have been in the AF inventory less
             than 10 years (See Chapter 2).
             1.18.3.2.3.2. The IMS, having the condemnation history, asset history,
             acquisition history, and other data readily available, will input any available data
             needed to compute the replacement factor, subject to review by the ES. The ES
             will develop and submit to the IMS the replacement factor data, including usage,
             life maximum, and life expectancy for use in PULE according to the prescribed
             AFMC 21-series maintenance manuals.
         1.18.3.2.4. Replacements based on Technical Order (TO) guidance for service life
         and repair cost (e.g., TO 00-25-240, Uniform Repair/Replacement Criteria for
 26                                                           AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011


           Selected USAF Support Equipment) will be computed off-line by manual procedures.
           This replacement quantity will be input to the D039 systems as Type Requirement
           Code (TRC) 11 additive. The IMS will annotate the Notepad to separately identify
           the replacement and unsuitable asset quantity. TRCs 10 through 15 and a time
           phasing date can be used to add replacement requirements into the RAR, Section 4,
           Additive Requirements Data, for items to be replaced due to age. If the item to be
           replaced is listed in the Aerospace Ground Equipment Master Plan as a replacement
           candidate, the IMS must use the standard model reflected in the plan as the replacing
           item. No substitution is allowed.
           1.18.3.2.5. Optimum Reliability Through Effective Management (ORTEM) is a
           procedure applicable to a narrow range of test equipment, and is used to project ATS
           replacement quantities in advance of need.
           1.18.3.2.6. Registered Equipment Management System (REMS) items compute
           replacements based on age and supply condition code (SCC). The replacement factor
           and replacement criteria code must always be blank.
   1.18.4. Procurement Lead Time Data. The procurement lead time is used by the system to
   determine the asset quantity required at the time assets will be ready for delivery.
   Procurement lead time is a combination of the Administrative Lead Time (ALT) and the
   Production Lead Time (PLT) (see Chapter 3).
       1.18.4.1. ALT for equipment items is normally understood to be the time from the
       procurement document initiation until contract award. However, ALT is really the time
       from the 4th quarter of the funding year until the anticipated contract award. If the
       contract is anticipated to be awarded during the funding year, the ALT will be zero. The
       only time ALT will be justified is when a contract will not be awarded by the end of the
       4th quarter of the funding year. This justification must be documented in the Notepad and
       on the AFMC Form 318, Item Contracting History Record. Further, since executability
       requires items to be awarded in the first funding year, very few items will have ALT
       greater than zero.
       1.18.4.2. PLT for equipment items will be number of months after contract award (or the
       4th quarter of the funding year; whichever is later) until the delivery of the first
       production article.
1.19. Asset History. All acquired assets will be accounted for by the IMS until C001 has been
fully developed and implemented, and has operated successfully long enough to establish a
baseline. After acceptance of the asset baseline, asset history of acquired assets will be
mechanically accomplished by the C001 system. For equipment items entering the AF inventory
after the implementation of the system, a complete ―cradle-to-grave‖ asset tracking of all
acquired assets will be done. For those items in the AF inventory prior to the implementation of
the C001 system, the baseline for asset history will be the total of the in-use, as reported by
D200C, plus those losses recorded by D200C at its implementation. Losses occurring before the
implementation of C001 will not be considered in any asset history procedures.
1.20. Asset Data. All assets considered unsuitable within the I&S system will be excluded from
use to satisfy requirements within the D039 system. All suitable assets reported as unsatisfactory
substitutes by the using activity (provided in-use asset NSN differs from authorized NSN) will be
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                       27


excluded for that specific authorization and reapplied elsewhere in the computation of net
requirements after the reporting period. No assets in lower capability computation groups within
an I&SG will be used to satisfy an authorization within a higher capability computation group
unless the user has in-use possession of the asset and reports it as a satisfactory substitute. The
IM or LM will never reduce the quantity of in-use assets or change the item code through which
the user expresses satisfaction with an item unless written concurrence from the user is on file.
   1.20.1. Assets used in determining net materiel requirements are: equipment currently in-
   use by all activities; equipment in the base and depot warehouses; equipment due-in from
   contractor; and equipment on order or funded.
   1.20.2. Assets will be separated into various ownership/purchased for/purpose codes to
   indicate availability of assets for specialized logistics needs or projects. Of these, the D039
   system recognizes only 0A (AF) and 0D (Technical Order Compliance – TOC). For
   maximum system efficiency, assets will not be placed in specialized accounts unless a firm
   requirement exists or will exist in the future.
1.21. Program Data. Time-phased programming data used in developing requirements will be
based on C001 forecasted data to compute requirements seven years into the future. (D200C
shows requirements 12 years into the future; however, D039 computes only seven years worth of
requirements. The last five years in D200C are straight-lined.)
1.22. Support Levels. Non-expendable items are acquired to meet only specific predetermined
future requirements, to fill existing shortages, or to replace assets that have been condemned.
The requirements computation is intended to take into account all of these conditions. Therefore,
stock levels normally are not authorized IAW AFMAN 23-110, V3, P10, C1, para 1.5. (located
at                                                                                 http://www.e-
publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/PUBS/AF/23/23011003/031001/031001.pdf), except
for individual equipment as authorized by AFMAN 23-110, V1, P1, C12, para 12.72.7. (at
http://www.e-
publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/PUBS/AF/23/23011001/010112/010112.pdf).                It is
recognized, however, that some circumstances require the inclusion of requirements that are
identified outside of the normal data systems. In such cases, the IM is authorized to develop
operating support levels, equipment rotation levels, or positive support levels to be entered into
the D039 computation as additive requirements. Written justification to support this
authorization will include the method used to calculate and/or determine the quantities.
Documentation for equipment support levels will be maintained by the IMS for as long as the
additive requirement remains in the D039 computation. The ALC D039/D200C OPR will
review and approve all operating support levels. Levels will be approved on an item-by-item
basis.
   1.22.1. Operating Support Levels. An operating support level is a quantity above that
   computed by the D039 system to cover unique circumstances involving the acquisition,
   distribution, or maintenance of an item of support equipment and selected
   telecommunications and electronics equipment. Since operating support levels involves
   unique circumstances, no standard method for their computation can be applied. The IMS
   computes operating support levels with appropriate assistance from the ES, the production
   management specialist, or the System Manager (SM). Given the peculiarities of workload
   among ALCs, conditions that warrant operating support levels will be determined by ALC
28                                                           AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011


  management. Justification for operating support levels across a range of items will be
  forwarded to 405 SCMS/GULA for approval. An example of a range across a range of items
  would be several items within an FSC or that apply to a Mission Design Series (MDS). The
  following are intended to serve as examples of operating support levels and their method of
  computation. They are offered as guidelines and are not to be taken as a complete list of all
  permissible instances which may be covered by operating support levels.
     1.22.1.1. Some cases may arise where factors outside of the D039 system make
     forecasting accurate requirements difficult or impossible. These cases, when they occur,
     usually involve base conversions, allowance standards, increases, or new activations to
     which the system did not have time to react. Under these circumstances, a level equal to
     the difference between the budget and the buy requirement may be developed. This
     would allow the IMS to buy the budget requirement. Use of this method would require
     detailed explanation by the SM why the D039 system was not able to forecast the
     requirement accurately.
     1.22.1.2. A contractually repaired item that will not be inducted for repair during the
     current FY due to long ALT may also be assigned an operating support level computed
     according to the method suggested in para 1.22.1.1 This would compensate for any
     potential lost support due to unserviceable assets awaiting a repair contract. However,
     repair and subsequent availability of those unserviceable assets may necessitate a
     reduction of the buy requirement in the subsequent FY.
     1.22.1.3. Embedded pieces of equipment are not normally reported as in-use assets in the
     equipment in-use detail portion of the requirements computation (RAR, Section 1). Since
     these items are installed in another piece of equipment, they are authorized only as part of
     the Next Higher Assembly (NHA). However, the IMS may still receive valid requisitions
     for them. An operating support level may be established to support these requisitions;
     justification must include an explanation why the higher assembly cannot be provided,
     and why the embedded item cannot be managed as a recoverable component (ERRC ―C‖
     or ―T‖).
  1.22.2. Equipment Rotation Levels. Field units are occasionally authorized items in small
  quantities that require periodic overhaul or calibration in shops. If the continual operation of
  these items is essential to the assigned mission, it may be necessary to set up a small quantity
  or reserve pool of these items at the prime ALC for rotation to field units while in-use items
  are being overhauled or calibrated. Non-expendable components are included.
     1.22.2.1. Levels must be based on the time required to return, induct, repair or calibrate,
     and return an item to the user. Normally, actual experience will be used to develop these
     pipeline times-reparable in transit days, base processing days, supply-to-maintenance
     days (if applicable), and serviceable turn-in days (if applicable). For items that have been
     in the system for less than two years, the equipment specialist or production management
     specialist may recommend estimated times. In the absence of any of other data, standards
     that apply to similar equipment may be used. Quantities must also be limited to those
     extra requirements generated by the peculiar conditions (see para 1.22.2.) rather than for
     all AF activities using the item. Regional location of rotational quantities may be
     affected if the ALC and using command determine it more economical and responsive.
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                    29


      1.22.2.2. The following product sources may be used as a source for shop flow days for
      items being repaired. G019C.-FW10, contractor shop flow days by Manager Designator
      Code (MDC), for time required to repair items under contract; and, A-G019C.-C23-
      C2MJ1, Management of Items Subject To Repair (MISTR) in projected workload report,
      for time required to repair items in depot maintenance.
      1.22.2.3. Justification is required and will be documented by the IMS indicating logic
      used in selecting computing methods used to determine quantities and dollar value of the
      levels. Rotation levels are not permitted for items that are authorized other types of
      levels.
   1.22.3. Positive Support Levels. Under some circumstances, the IMS may establish a
   positive support level to assure continued support for certain low cost items with high rates
   of issues and condemnations. The primary criterion for selecting candidates for positive
   support levels is that emergency acquisition may be necessary in the next FY without them.
   Candidates must also meet all of the following conditions:
      1.22.3.1. The unit cost must be less than $1000; 405 SCMS/GULA approves candidates
      with higher unit costs;
      1.22.3.2. Demands must exceed normal increases in authorizations;
      1.22.3.3. Item must not be subject to other support levels (flight safety or equipment
      rotations);
      1.22.3.4. Candidate items must have no authorizations for other support levels;
      1.22.3.5. All support levels will be reviewed and approval annually by the ALC; and
      1.22.3.6. The IMS will maintain complete justification for all positive support levels.
      This justification will include the budget program affected, the method used to calculate
      the quantities, and the dollar value of the level. The ALC OPR will maintain a list of
      items, by budget program that have been approved for positive support levels.
   1.22.4. Stock/Operating Levels. Levels of selected equipment items may be established at
   base level with the approval of the Accountable Officer (AO) per AFMAN 23-110, V2, P2,
   C21,       para      21.71.7.     or     C22,       para     22.162(at   http://www.e-
   publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/afman23-110.pdf). These levels will be reflected in
   the Base and ALC Asset Record Type ―A‖ (input to D039 via C001). Maximum operating
   levels will be accumulated by NSN by Department of Defense Activity Address Directory
   (DODAAD) and passed to the D039 system.
1.23. Backorders.
   1.23.1. Backorders are not generally authorized for inclusion in the requirements
   computation. However, all backorders whose document numbers start with FF (non-reporting
   activity) are mechanically input as additives. Any other backorder will be input as an
   additive only if the IMS can establish that the requirement is valid and has not been
   otherwise input into the computation. The IMS will review the AFEMS AIOR/AAVC
   screens to ensure AFEMS reflects a corresponding authorization record for the backorder.
   More detailed information regarding backorders, input as additive requirements, can be
   found in Chapter 2.
 30                                                           AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011


   1.23.2. IMS may use cancellation code ―FN‖ on invalid backorders. This code informs the
   requester that the backorder does not match AFEMS reporting and appropriate action will be
   taken by their organizations prior to re-submittal. IMS may use ―CA‖ cancellation if
   additional information is necessary as a means of explanation.
1.24. Initial Requirements for Support Equipment. As SE items are identified in the
provisioning process, the IMS is responsible for reviewing and revising contractor
recommendations according to AFMCI 23-101, Air Force Provisioning Instruction. For initial
SE common to other USAF programs included in D039, the IMS will review the last D200C
computation and latest authorization and asset information from C001 to determine availability
of assets to support the new SE requirement.               The approved Support Equipment
Recommendation Data (SERD) is the authorizing document for Government Furnished
Equipment (GFE)/ Contractor Furnished Equipment (CFE) SE requirements. The IMS will
make sure these requirements and resulting assets are not duplicated but are included as additives
in RAR, Section 4. The IMS will also make sure GFE/CFE items are offset with an on-hand or
due-in asset. CFE due-in information will be input to C001 screens by the SM.
1.25. Requirements Formula. Although the internal processing of data required to develop
equipment item requirements is quite complex, the basic elements can be reduced to the
following oversimplified formula: equipment authorizations applied to projected organization
programs; plus additives and replacement requirements; minus total assets (including on-order
and funded); equal net shortage or excess (see Chapter 6).
1.26. Materiel Repair. AF policy is to ―repair before buy.‖ The IMS will make sure all
suitable reparable assets are scheduled for repair when the computation group has a net
requirement at the buy or budget position, or has assets due-in from contracting. In such cases,
the IMS must analyze the elements making up the requirement to determine the feasibility of
amending the materiel repair schedule.
1.27. Unit Price. The unit price is mechanically input from the Master Item Identification
Control System (D043) system. This price includes First Destination Transportation (FDT). The
IMS will update the unit price through ERS file maintenance or D200C file maintenance when
NSN is not in ERS. These file maintenance changes are effective until a later price is received
(based on the cataloged date). For ERS NSNs, reference para 1.13.
   1.27.1. Contractor Quotes/Estimates. If a more current contractor quote or estimate is
   received, it will be file maintained into ERS or D200C, when NSN is not in ERS.
   Procurement date is updated to the latest date.
   1.27.2. Secondary Inventory Control Activity (SICA) Unit Price Update. If the AF is the
   SICA for an item and the Primary Inventory Control Activity (PICA) has not updated the
   unit price, the IMS will file maintain the updated price into ERS (or D200C, when NSN is
   not in ERS) when source data is available.
   1.27.3. Price Escalation. Price escalation can be selected on various reports. This escalates
   the price based on the procurement date and the inflation index. The inflation index is
   maintained by 405 SCMS/GULA based on data provided by SAF/FM.
1.28. Termination. Termination level will be the total gross requirement at the higher of the
buy, budget, or budget+1 position. The quantity of assets to be considered for termination will
be those on-order assets not needed to meet termination level requirements. Termination action
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                       31


will only be considered where total assets exceed total requirements at the higher of the buy,
budget or budget+1 position. When termination quantities are computed and validated, prompt
action will be taken to effect termination of contracting and acquisition action (see Chapter 8).
1.29. Retention. Retention level will be the total gross requirement at the highest computed
program position plus AF-directed and elected-to-hold quantities. The quantity of assets to be
retained will be all assets, exclusive of those computed for termination, required to meet the
retention level. For those items indicated as deferred disposal items on the IMCD, all assets will
be kept as directed. The computed retention level will not be raised through additive
requirements technique without complete justification. The IMS will not code an item ―deferred
disposal.‖ The IMS/SM/LM will decide if a need for a retention level exists for items identified
in the following paragraphs.
   1.29.1. The IMS/SM/LM will retain serviceable and supportable support equipment to fill
   anticipated unprogrammed requirements with documentation and justification. Rationale for
   retention of excess assets includes: holding assets for an expected requirement; holding
   assets to support reclamation program(s); offering assets to other services; or, offering assets
   to FMS programs. If this rationale does not apply, the IMS will review the assets for
   potential disposal action.
   1.29.2. The organization requesting the retention of assets will provide a memorandum to
   the IMS which states the rationale and describes the following information:
       1.29.2.1. NSNs and nouns for the items being retained;
       1.29.2.2. Specific quantities by NSN;
       1.29.2.3. Standard price and extended cost of items beings retained;
       1.29.2.4. Reason(s) for retention (e.g., project name);
       1.29.2.5. Size of item in cubic feet and amount of space required to retain the full
       amount;
       1.29.2.6. Length of time assets are to be retained; and
1.29.2.7. Cost of retention.
   1.29.3. The IMS will prepare and submit the package for signature through their respective
   coordination cycles. They will retain the documentation and identified excess equipment
   assets up to a period of one year provided they have proper justification. If retention is
   required beyond that time period, the organization will provide follow-on justification prior
   to the expiration date. Signature level requirements can be found in Attachment 5.
   1.29.4. If the retention requirement exists for more than two years for the Security
   Assistance Programs (SAP), the SM or the Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC)
   must provide an explanation of the problem contributing to the additional extension to the
   IMS for approval. Note: Existing SAP countries may continue for eight to 10 years after the
   item is no longer in the active AF inventory.
   1.29.5. Peculiar support equipment will also be retained along with major end items when
   units are deactivated providing proper documentation is provided to the IMS.
 32                                                            AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011


   1.29.6. Retention requirements exceeding the computed retention will be input and
   maintained by the IMS. To learn more about retention additives and SAP specific retention
   additives refer to paragraph 2.11. In addition, Chapter 5 provides procedures for adding,
   changing, and deleting additive requirements.
1.30. Disposal. Quantity of assets to be considered for disposal action, according to AFMAN
23-110,               V3,            P1,             C9              (at            http://www.e-
publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/PUBS/AF/23/23011003/030109/030109.pdf), will be
those assets exceeding the retention level exclusive of those assets subject to termination action.
If disposal quantities are computed, prompt action will be taken through normal supply channels
to dispose of assets.
1.31. Training. Training all ALC personnel who work with the equipment requirements
systems are important contributors to the effective equipment management. A formal training
program will be carried out locally by each ALC training organization for all personnel who
assume positions in which the C001, D039, and D200C system products are a substantial portion
of their workload. Refresher training will be given as the need occurs.
1.32. Quality Control. ALCs must set up internal operating procedures to make sure this
regulation is effectively carried out.
1.33. Cataloging and Item Identification.
   1.33.1. It is Department of Defense (DoD) and AF policy that all items of equipment will be
   identified by NSN as soon as requirements are known, and NSNs will be deleted promptly
   when identification of an item is no longer needed. However, NSNs that are identified as
   Nuclear Weapons-Related Materiel (NWRM) will remain as cataloged items even when
   there are no remaining items in the inventory to maintain visibility and provide control for
   assets that may be found later. Management teams are responsible for deciding if and at
   what time item is required, when it is no longer needed and indicating status to the cataloging
   organization for stock list or delete action. Prompt and aggressive actions will be taken in
   this area of materiel management.
   1.33.2. NSNs are assigned in the AF cataloging system (D043A) for most equipment items
   during the provisioning process for new weapon systems, subsystems or as a result of
   modification programs. The number is then automatically established in D035A, and passed
   to C001, and D039/ D200C through system interfaces. Once the NSN is established in an
   AS, D043 assigns a freeze code, and users can start reporting authorizations and assets. The
   D200C system will indicate when requirements for a NSN are no longer reported and
   whether any assets exist.
   1.33.3. When it is determined the NSN has become obsolete and requirements no longer
   exist, action must be taken to dispose of all assets, remove the NSN from all AS, and change
   AAC to ―Y‖ (terminal).
       1.33.3.1. A freeze code will prevent the IMS from deleting the NSN from D043 and the
       AAC ―Y‖ will change to an AAC ―X‖ if the NSN is listed in an AS, and/or an
       authorization or asset is being reported. If the freeze code prevents the NSN from being
       deleted from D043, the IMS must research AFEMS AAVC and TINQ screens for
       reported authorization, asset, and allowance data to find the reason for the freeze code.
       Then the IMS can negotiate with appropriate base, system monitor, or allowance manager
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                     33


       to have the reporting corrected. After all authorization, asset, and AS records have been
       eliminated from C001, the system automatically creates a freeze code delete transaction
       for D043. This permits normal cataloging delete action to occur.
       1.33.3.2. If the IMS finds, in the negotiation process, that a valid requirement continues
       to exist for the item, immediate action will be taken to reestablish the NSN as an active
       item in the cataloging system.
1.34. Item Peculiarities.
   1.34.1. Ground Communication-Electronic-Meteorological (CEM) Equipment.
       1.34.1.1. Developmental (peculiar) SE requirements for support of non-weapon system
       ground CEM equipment will be developed to the extent possible by the procedures in this
       instruction.
       1.34.1.2. The above guidance and limitation will also be applied to the determination of
       additive requirements for standard (common) SE. However, the factor used will be
       expanded to two percent of end article cost for these items.
   1.34.2. Vehicular Equipment.
       1.34.2.1. Vehicle requirements will be determined basically in the same way as other
       equipment items except for the following considerations.
           1.34.2.1.1. Vehicle assets will be input to the computation by the registration number
           of each individual vehicle.
           1.34.2.1.2. Vehicle replacements will be determined by age and condition rather than
           replacement factor. Replacement for special purpose equipment which is mounted on
           vehicle chassis will be expressed in terms of appropriate vehicle chassis if the
           mounted equipment is serviceable and not expected to become obsolete during the
           expected service life of the replacement chassis.
       1.34.2.2. Procedural vehicle peculiarities are in Chapter 6, .
   1.34.3. Items for Training Purposes.
       1.34.3.1. The Air Education and Training Command (AETC) may require equipment
       items for training purposes. Initial contracting plans for items approved for service, but
       not previously acquired for other than service test, will include consideration of any
       requirement for training.
       1.34.3.2. The IMS or ES, along with ALC/DPC, will negotiate with AETC for training
       requirements for all new and newly configured items. The training requirements will be
       included in the computation as additives (Chapter 2).
       1.34.3.3. After acquisition is started, the IMS must advise AETC of final dollars and
       quantities placed on acquisition so the AETC can include these new item requirements on
       their next C001 update.
1.35. Spares Factor. The spares factor is used to budget dollars for spare parts -- do not
confuse this with budgeting spare end items. The factor is expressed as a percentage of the unit
cost of the end item. If the item will be acquired from competitive sources, or under military
specifications, the spares factor will be used to budget spare parts. If, when the contract is
 34                                                            AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011


awarded, it is determined that the item will be identical or similar to an item already in the
inventory, actual dollars budgeted for spare parts can be re-budgeted.
1.36. Use of Replenishment Funds. Replenishment funds are allowed for procurement when
circumstances dictate. It is DoD policy to fill requirements from within, to include redistribution
from other Services, before procuring additional equipment.
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                    35

                        SYSTEM TECHNIQUES AND FEATURES

2.1. Overview. The D039 processes secret and unclassified information. The unclassified
computer processing provides end products via D200C. D039 completes the cycle by processing
secret and remaining unclassified information accepting input from D200C, AFEMS, and
outputting unclassified results to D200C, to RMS Applications and Indentures (API)/D200F (for
the Secondary Item Requirements System [SIRS]/D200A items), and to the Automated Budget
Compilation System (ABCS)/D075.
2.2. RMS. The objectives of D200C are to:
   2.2.1. Provide quality products which will integrate the processing of all centrally-procured
   equipment item data;
   2.2.2. Provide on-line access to equipment data by weapon system;
   2.2.3. Enable the user to perform I&S restructuring;
   2.2.4. Update repair and recoverable data;
   2.2.5. Provide the capability to perform on-line file maintenance;
   2.2.6. Produce output files which enables the EIP to interface with other systems;
   2.2.7. Print hard copy reports as requested by the user; and
   2.2.8. Provide the capability through DATA QUERY for users to structure/tailor their own
   on-screen displays and hard copy products by extracting data elements from the equipment
   database.
2.3. File Maintenance. D200C provides the capability to perform on-line file maintenance of
IMCD, RAR, and WS data, along with notepad capability to annotate file maintenance actions.
It also provides on-line file maintenance of requirements and assets, edit tables, Escalation
Factor Tables (EFT), and I&S restructuring.
2.4. On-line/Displays. D200C provides on-line displays of IMCD, RAR, Item Management
Statistics (IMS), Over-Age Additives (OAA), Weapon System Product (WSP), requirements and
edit tables, EFT, Valid Changes/Notepad (VCNP), Net Requirements by Location (NRL),
Projected Requirements and Assets (PRA), Item and Dollar Summary Stratification (IDSS),
Index of Actions (IA), Materiel Procurement Program Control (MPPC), Inventory of Principal
Items (IPI), and Inventory Variance Reports (IV, NSV, SNV).
2.5. Hard Copy Reports.
   2.5.1. The following hard copy reports are generated via on-line request in Output Products
   (OP) and are produced in total or in sections: IMCD, RAR, Notepad, OAA, WSP, Repair
   Index of Actions (RIA), Asset Reconciliation (AR) Worksheet, Stock Number Variances
   (SNV), NSN Stock Record Account Number (SRAN) variances (NSV), Vehicle In-Use (VI)
   Inventory Data, Additive Requirements Summary (ARS), Valid Change Listing, NRL, PRA,
   IDSS, IA, MPPC, IPI, and Inventory Variance (IV) Report.

   2.5.2. Push Products to the ALCs: Equipment Stock Number Change List (quarterly);
   Equipment OAA Requirements (1 March and 1 September); PRA (quarterly and semiannual
   update cycles); AR List (semiannual update data); AR Worksheets (quarterly and
   semiannual); Basic IA (quarterly and semiannually); and Equipment RIA (semiannually).
2.5.3. Audit Reports (exception listings) and Control Reports to 405 SCMS/GULA: Phased
Assets by NSN; NRL; Net Requirements by WS; Projected Assets by Location; Projected Assets
by WS; RIAR Data; Asset History Losses, Valid Organization File, Asset NSN Summary File;
Asset Reduction Control File; and Authorization and Asset Master.
   2.5.4. Interfaces. The EIP provides for the loading of data from other systems to be used in
   its equipment computations and produces associated load and error reports. Inputs include
   quarterly interfaces with the D039. The RMS Requirements Item Identification Data
   (RIID)/D200E system receives inputs from J018 and D043, and makes this data available for
   EIP processing. Output files are produced for interfacing systems: Air Force Accounting and
   Finance Center (AFAFC) for life expectancy, AFEMS (vehicles and NSN/lead time file),
   D067, Acquisition Interim Support, Purchase Request Process System (PRPS)/D203, and
   W001 [Equipment Stock Number Lead Time File for Security Assistance Management
   Information System (SAMIS)]. EIP provides for the creation of recoverable application
   program data and initial repair requirements data (RRD) to be used by other subsystems.
   2.5.5. RMS equipment provides for the computation of replacement and repair rate factors,
   computation group reference numbers, item management asset data, weapon system reported
   position data, weapon system asset realignment, price escalation, RRD, recoverable
   application program data, and Mission Item Essentiality Codes (MIECs).
2.6. D039 Primary Functions.
   2.6.1. Accept Assets and Requirements. This classified function accepts input data
   including, but not limited to: base/ALC assets and Equipment Authorization Inventory Data
   (EAID) including vehicles from C001; Stock Number Cross Reference (SNCR) File;
   Requirements Tables (SRAN, MAJCOM and type); and additive file maintenance
   transactions from D200C which builds asset history and consolidates requirement and asset
   data.
   2.6.2. Phased Requirements. Phased requirements originate in the classified portion of C001
   via direct MAJCOM input to AFEMS. This phasing data is then passed to D039 which
   processes secret and unclassified data; assigns Computation Group Stock Numbers (CGSN);
   matches the Valid Organization File (C001) to assign area code, allocation priority, and if
   Program Action Code (PAC) = ―R,‖ assigns the original DODAAD, SRAN and MAJCOM
   for input to RMS. D039 also merges the detailed time-phased requirements (peacetime &
   WRM authorizations and in-use/in-place assets and forecast requirements), base and ALC
   warehouse and due-in assets and additive requirements to create a RAR master file
   (classified); creates an unclassified Valid Organization File for D200C; creates an
   unclassified file of phased requirements and assets for RAR from the classified RAR master;
   and, builds the phased requirements used to develop net requirements. See Table 13.14 to
   review the PAC and its meaning.
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                      37


   2.6.3. Develop Net Requirements. This classified function determines total assets and
   requirements for application, allocation, high-cost alignment and realignment, allotment and
   alignment of bachelor items and I&SGs, and computation of replacement requirements.
   2.6.4. Prepare Computation Master Files. This function prepares computation master files.
   2.6.5. Produce RMS Interfaces. This function requires both secret and unclassified
   processing. It prepares and consolidates basic control data, creates and summarizes gains and
   losses, declassifies phased assets, assigns master I&S NSNs, creates weapon system net
   requirements, net requirements by location, weapon system aligned assets, projected assets
   by location and recoverable application program data for other RMS subsystems.
      2.6.5.1. The RMS subsystems (D200F/A) use the D039 September update recoverable
      application program data in the RMS 31 December computation cycle. Similarly, it uses
      the D039 March update file in the 30 June cycle. D039 provides future program data for
      equipment items by actual NSN for seven FYs plus retention. This quarterly data is the
      lesser of requirements or assets (applied and allocated assets) by quarter for 24 quarters
      beyond D200A’s initial cycle as of date, and for 26 quarters in D200A’s mid cycle
      computation. The retention program is equal to the applied and allocated assets, for the
      SGM, at the end of the 7th year of the computation, times 36 (months). The D039
      recoverable application program data output file contains the following elements: actual
      NSN; type program (3 = equipment months, or 9 = Automated Repair and Requirements
      System [ARRS]); service code (A = AF); program begin date (FY and quarter); 28 fields
      for quarterly phased program data; and retention period quantity (in the 29th quarter).
   2.6.6. Produce D075 Interfaces.       This unclassified function prepares tape output
   semiannually (from the March and September update computation cycles) to D075, which
   receives five-year projections of computed repair requirements for equipment items in-use
   and warehouse assets applied or allocated to AF requirements, excluding assets applied or
   allocated to WRM, or replacement requirements.
   2.6.7. Produce Internal Statistics. This unclassified function maintains internal processing
   statistics for management information. The internal processing statistics include record
   counts, processing times, special program counts, print counts, file identifications and record
   layout identifications, record messages and descriptions.
2.7. Item Aggregation.
   2.7.1. All items included in the equipment item requirements computation system are
   assembled by computation groups known as ―subgroups‖ and ―I&SGs‖. Items are grouped
   together in I&SGs because they have an interchangeable or substitutable relationship to each
   other from an engineering or technical viewpoint. Items which are interchangeable imply
   that any NSN in a subgroup can be used to satisfy the application. A substitute relationship
   exists when one NSN can be used in place of the other, but not vice versa. However, the I&S
   ―master‖ is the most preferred because it can be used to satisfy all applications in the I&SG.
   Note: a ―bachelor‖ NSN is not in an I&SG; however, it will be treated as if it were both a
   SGM and an I&S master NSN.
   2.7.2. Order of Use (OOU) and Jump-to Code (JTC) are used to portray I&S relationships.
   OOU is a three position code; the first two positions (subgroup code) indicate whether items
   belong in the same subgroup; the third position denotes the sequence code (also known as
 38                                                           AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011


   parts preference) which is used in conjunction with the OOU to depict the most preferred
   item. The sequence code can be alphabetic or numeric; where, ―A‖ has a lower preference
   than ―B‖ which is less preferred than ―C‖. Sequence code ―4‖ denotes Time Compliance
   Technical Order (TCTO) modification in progress and ―9‖ specifies safety-of-flight
   unsuitability, but might be usable in ground applications. When making decisions to group
   items together for other services, disagreements can arise upon I&S, therefore, the JTC is
   used to reflect an exception to the normal, progressive I&S relationship pertaining to a family
   group. A JTC identifies the next preferred item in the next acceptable subgroup, and must
   always skip at least one entire subgroup.

Table 2.1. I&S Example
ACTUAL NSN                   OOU        JTC       RANKING
1                            AAA                  Least preferred
2                            AAB                  Subgroup ―AA‖ Master
3                            ABA        ACA
4                            ABB
5                            ABC                  Subgroup ―AB‖ Master
6                            ACA
7                            ACB                  Subgroup ―AC‖ Master; I&S Master


   2.7.3. See Table 2.1. Note: Actual NSNs contain from thirteen to fifteen alphanumeric
   positions, but for simplification, are listed in the example with one position. Actual NSN 1 is
   known as the least preferred item at the wholesale level/depot/ALC because it has the lowest
   ranking OOU (where, A<B <C). Actual NSN 2 is the SGM for the ―AA‖ subgroup since its
   sequence code of B is preferred over that of actual NSN 1. Actual NSN 3 is the least
   preferred item in the ―AB‖ subgroup, and actual NSN 6 is the lesser preferred item in the
   ―AC‖ subgroup. Actual NSNs 5 and 7 are SGMs for the ―AB‖ and ―AC‖ subgroups,
   respectively. Finally, actual NSN 7 is also the I&S master NSN since it is able to fulfill all
   specifications for items in all subgroups. Note: The existence of the JTC of ―AC‖ means the
   agency has deemed the ―AB‖ subgroup as unsatisfactory in functionality and will not be
   considered as a substitute for any of the items in the I&SG for that agency.
   2.7.4. Additional information can be found in AFMCI 20-101, Elimination of Duplication in
   the Management and Logistics Support of Interchangeable and Substitutable Items (at
   http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFMCI20-101.pdf) and AFMAN
   23-110, V1, P1, C7, ―Interchangeability and Substitutability Data‖ (at http://www.e-
   publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/PUBS/AF/23/23011001/010107/010107.pdf).
   2.7.5. The grouping of equipment items is compatible with the I&S program (D043), except
   for NSNs which are manually added to the IMCD via RMS file maintenance, or groups the
   equipment requirements monitors restructure.
   2.7.6. I&S Restructure. RMS provides the capability to restructure I&SG by changing either
   the OOU or JTC, or by splitting apart I&SGs. This I&S restructuring feature will be utilized
   only by those individuals with a thorough knowledge of I&S relationships and their impacts.
   Following the internal interface of D200C and D200E subsystems (this interface is also
   known as the D200E ―snapshot‖), but prior to D039 computation processing, I&SGs may be
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                       39


   restructured through RMS file maintenance to join I&S groups that have been split apart by
   cataloging, to relate items that need to be computed in the same I&S group, or to split apart
   I&SGs that will not be computed together. A split will make each SGM in the I&SG a
   master item. A change to OOU will alter sub-group preference while maintaining sub-group
   integrity. A user will join I&SGs only within his specific IMS group; however, a user will
   not add an NSN to an existing sub-group. Each group or NSN added will require a unique
   sub-group code. Note: Permanent changes to I&SGs must be made through the cataloging
   system. RMS file maintenance of I&S relationships will be recognized for one year, at
   which time the IMS must choose to retain the file maintained I&S relationship or allow
   system to default to the I&S relationship in D043. When a PICA catalogs an I&S
   relationship in the D043 system, it takes precedence and must be followed by the SICA.
2.8. Sources of Input. Source systems include C001 which provides reported authorizations
and assets (both vehicle and non-vehicle), losses, dated forecast records, area code, allocation
priority data, and mechanically built additive data. RMS D200E interfaces with D043, which
provides cataloging data, and with J018, which provides acquisition and lead time information.
All mechanized data entering the requirements computation will be edited for errors and
corrected externally by the source system; however, internal edits are available along with
limited provisions for internal corrections by exercising D200C file maintenance procedures.
2.9. Requirements Projection. C001 supplies a complete one-of-a-kind organization
identification and has detail records stored in its data bank. Forecasting is accomplished when
MAJCOM Command Equipment Management Offices (CEMO) input forecasting records
directly to the classified segment of C001. The records contain information pertaining to
weapon system(s), location(s), phasing date(s), and the requirements’ quantities. Managers must
be cautioned that this information is classified as secret when all parts are combined together. If
this occurs, the data must be protected in the interest of national security and/or when that
combination of data is not made available for public disclosure.
2.10. Asset Application and Allocation. All assets are first identified to I&SG parts
preference, location, command ownership, and asset condition. Assets are then applied and
allocated according to the customer’s reported needs and controlled by need date, base,
command, area, and priority.
   2.10.1. Application and Reapplication.
       2.10.1.1. Assets reported as in-use will remain with that organization as long as a
       requirement exists. When the cost of an out-of-computation group, substitute asset
       exceeds the cost differential (more than $500 over the authorized CGSN), the asset will
       be subject to reallocation in its home computation group.
       2.10.1.2. Assets reported as excess to one organization’s requirements, as well as base
       warehouse serviceable assets, will be reapplied to another organization’s requirements in
       the following order: same SRAN, same command and area, same area but different
       command, WW. Reapplied assets will remain with the organization to which they have
       been reapplied as long as a requirement exists with that organization. Excess reapplied
       assets will be subject to allocation procedures.
   2.10.2. Alignment and Allocation.
 40                                                            AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011


       2.10.2.1. Prior to allocation, all remaining assets will be aligned by computation group to
       return all high-cost items (those out-of-I&SG suitable substitutes costing more than $500
       above the cost of the items for which they are being used) to the home computation group
       for allocation. If no requirement exists in the home computation group, these high cost
       assets will be returned to the organization reporting them as suitable substitutes. Also, all
       assets excess to their own computation group will be filtered down to lower-order
       computation groups having a shortage.
       2.10.2.2. Following the above alignment procedures, assets will be allocated to specific
       unfilled requirements (that is, shortages remaining after application and reapplication) on
       a quarter-by-quarter basis.
       2.10.2.3. Although assets of higher-order computation groups will be allocated to
       requirements of lower order computation groups, the reverse will not be true. While it
       contributes to building shortages in high-order computation groups and excesses in low-
       order groups, it is completely responsive to customer needs and inventory upgrading.
       Before initiating new acquisition, requirements must be reviewed both by individual
       computation group and by total across all computation groups within I&SG. This type of
       manual review is necessary to ensure a proper balance between economic considerations
       and inventory upgrading. To support this review, output products are developed by
       individual computation groups but assembled by I&SG.
   2.10.3. Vehicle Application and Allocation. See Chapter 6, Vehicle Peculiarities.
2.11. Additives. The purpose of additive requirements in the equipment item requirements
computation is to provide for any type requirement that generates from a non-reporting source.
Data for mechanically-built additives will be furnished to D039 from C001.
   2.11.1. Valid requirements not mechanically included in the computation may be manually
   input as additives. Additives must be checked for currency, revalidation and non-publication
   during the March and September computation cycles, and it is recommended that they be
   reviewed quarterly to ensure they do not duplicate other requirements already in the
   computation.
       2.11.1.1. The system, without IMS intervention, will retain IMS additives for a year.
       Mechanically created additives are only valid for the current cycle and are recreated each
       cycle as required. The OAA is pushed to the IMS, identifying additives (transaction
       dates greater than 365 days old) that will be purged on the next computation cycle. If the
       additive is to be retained more than a year, a change action must be accomplished by the
       IMS.
       2.11.1.2. Due to the time difference between the computation cutoff date and the IMS
       review capability, IMSs often receive backorders that do not have requirements in the
       computed data. To ensure all possible requirements are included in the management
       decision processes; IMSs will review the backorder listing against RMS RAR screens and
       AFEMS Asset/In-Use Details or Asset/Validation screens (AIOR/AAVC/AAVW)
       screens for possible inclusion as additives. If the authorization is reflected in AFEMS but
       not in RAR and meets the following criteria, it may be included in RAR, Section 4 as an
       additive. Beware that additives input as a result of timing of the AFEMS interface have
       an extremely high risk of being duplicated in subsequent computation cycles.
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                    41


         2.11.1.2.1. Backorders citing ―6G‖ advice codes are for replacement of an on-hand
         asset that has been turned in or condemned. A shortage will exist in the computation
         for these requirements. RAR Section 1 must be reviewed to make sure there is an
         authorization and in-use asset detail record corresponding to the backorder.
         Backorders using advice code ―6G‖ may be added to RAR Section 4 using TRCs 10-
         15 if there is an authorization in RAR Section 1 which is not reflecting a shortage and
         the backorder was issued after (or within two weeks prior to) the cutoff date. These
         backorders will not be included if the forecasted replacement program is computing
         sufficient replacement requirements to cover these additional requirements.
         2.11.1.2.2. Backorders citing ―6R‖ and ―6S‖ advice codes are for replacement of an
         on-hand asset that will not be turned in or condemned until the replacement is
         received. No shortage will exist in the computation for these requirements. RAR
         Section 1 must be reviewed to make sure there is an authorization and in-use asset
         detail record corresponding to the backorder. Advice code ―6R‖ and ―6S‖ backorders
         may be added to Section 4 of the RAR using TRCs 10-15 if the above conditions
         exist and the forecasted replacement requirement is not large enough to cover these
         backorders.
         2.11.1.2.3. Backorders citing ―6H‖ and ―6J‖ advice codes are for new requirements.
         RAR Section 1 must be reviewed to make sure there is an authorization record
         corresponding to the backorder. If the authorization is not in RAR Section 1, the IMS
         will check AFEMS for the authorization. Backorders using advice codes ―6H‖ or ―6J‖
         may be added to RAR Section 4 using TRC 81 if there is no authorization in RAR
         Sections 1 or 3, but there is an authorization in AFEMS and the backorder was issued
         after (or within two weeks prior to) the cutoff date.
         2.11.1.2.4. Additives will not be input for allowances reported in AFEMS identified
         with the ASCs of 000, 000A, 044, 048, 050, 052, 987, or STBY. The D039 zeros out
         the authorization quantity. Refer to AFMAN 23-110, V2, P2, C22, Table 22L-1 (at
         http://www.e-
         publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/PUBS/AF/23/23011002/020222/020222.pdf
         )           orV4,             P1,           C4           (at          http://www.e-

         ) for ASC short titles and paragraph references .
  2.11.2. All manually entered requirements for each computation group must be documented
  with reasons on file/notepad for including these requirements in D200C. All backup data
  must clearly show rationale or justification used, and will be kept on file or notepad for
  review by audit agencies or higher management officials. This documentation shall be
  updated on an annual basis and kept as long as the additive requirement exists. File
  maintenance action will be taken to delete additive requirements as soon as the need for these
  additives has passed.
  2.11.3. Chapter 5 provides procedures for adding, changing, and deleting additive
  requirements.
  2.11.4. Additives used in the system are categorized by TRC.         The following additive
  specific information is available in RMS.
42                                                         AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011


     2.11.4.1. Type Requirements Table (TRT). The TRT is available on-line and is
     maintained by the 405 SCMS/GULA. The TRT lists TRCs 01-99, the default Additive
     Requirement Identification (ARID), Ownership Purpose and System Designator (OPSD)
     Indicator, Apply Additive Asset to Authorization Indicator, Compute Additive
     Replacement Requirement Indicator, and Account ID.
     2.11.4.2. Additive requirements for all TRCs are summarized on the ARS and are listed
     on RAR Section 4. RAR Section 6 summarizes TRCs 10 through 15 and 40 through 99
     by MAJCOM under the heading ―ADDIT AUTH;‖ in-use additive quantities for TRCs
     50 through 64 and 67 through 99 are summarized under the heading ―ADDIT I/U;‖ War
     Readiness Materiel authorized (―WRM AUTH‖) and in-place (WRM I/P) columns
     include not only RAR Section 3 WRM data, but also WRM additives (TRCs 1 through
     9). Additive requirements are also summarized on the additive requirements line of the
     following products: NRL (Sections 5 and 6), PRA, WSP (Sections 1 thru 4 and 6), and
     IDSS. Additives with a transaction date, which exceeds 365 days on the first day of April
     or October, appear on the OAA listing which is produced semiannually.
  2.11.5. The following additives are recognized by the system and are listed by TRC. Note:
  TRCs 10-15, 40, 41, and 93-99 for weapon systems listed in the Initial
  Requirements/BP/MDS (IBM) table are considered replacement requirements. All additive
  requirements input to Section 4, RAR identified to TRCs 01-09, 16-39, 42-65 and 67-92 for
  which the additive MDS matches an MDS in the IBM table will be considered as initial
  requirements. TRCs 25-39 are retention type additives, which will not increase the gross
  requirement, but will show up on the last page of the PRA in Buy/Budget Requirements
  Summary Report.
     2.11.5.1. TRCs 01 through 09, WRM Additives. WRM additives are manually-input
     WRM requirements, and are in addition to those reported through C001. Input appears
     on the WRM requirements line of the PRA.
     2.11.5.2. TRCs 10 through 15, Replacement Requirement Additives. Replacement
     additive requirements may be manually input when computed replacement programs are
     uncharacteristically inadequate or the system is coded (with RCCs E and F) to exclude
     the mechanical computation of replacement requirements. When the replacement
     program has been computed manually (by using ORTEM [RCC E] or technical order
     guidance [RCC F] techniques), and added to RAR, Section 4, TRCs 10-15 must be
     coupled with dated forecast data. Input appears on the replacement requirements line of
     the PRA (see para 2.11.5 Note).
     2.11.5.3. TRC 16, Non-reporting Backorders.         Non-reporting backorders are
     mechanically input from the SC&D system into the C001. TRC 16 records will not be
     manually file maintained into RMS. Input appears on the additive requirements line of
     the PRA.
     2.11.5.4. TRCs 17 through 19, Non-reporting Backorders. These non-reporting
     backorders are input via RMS file maintenance to cover special project/Air Force Supply
     Directive (AFSD) backorders that are not input mechanically. Coordination will be made
     with the project monitor to determine when the project will end or when a specific asset
     is no longer required. All USAF back orders (including TRC 16) which may have been
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                   43


     input as additives will be validated to ensure they are not duplicates of EAID reporting.
     Input appears on the additive requirements line of the PRA.
     2.11.5.5. TRCs 20 through 24 are not currently being used.
     2.11.5.6. TRCs 25 through 29, SAP and FMS Tentative or Retention Additive. (Only
     input TRC 25 at this time.) SAP/FMS tentative additive requirements have not been
     funded or interrogations have been made regarding the availability of reimbursable or
     non-reimbursable assets. SAP retention additives are manually input and apply when it is
     wise to retain a quantity of known or anticipated excesses. TRCs 25 through 29 appear
     on the directed/elected-to-hold-SAP line of the PRA’s Buy/Budget Requirements
     Summary Report if the sum of TRCs 25 to 29 is less than the sum of non-aligned suitable
     assets minus the directed/elected-to-hold-AF requirement (at the position that shows the
     highest gross requirement between the buy or budget positions). Input appears as
     Dir/Elect/Hold –SAP on the PRA (not a part of gross requirements).
     2.11.5.7. TRCs 30 through 39, Directed/Elected-to-Hold AF Requirements.
        2.11.5.7.1. TRCs 30 to 32 are manually input to equal the quantity the ALC has been
        directed to hold by the SM or higher headquarters. Input appears as the
        Dir/Elect/Hold –AF on the PRA.
        2.11.5.7.2. TRC 33 is mechanically derived based upon C001 input and applies to
        maximum operating levels and special ASCs 048, 064, 068, 076, and 985 reported by
        the base. Due to economic considerations, the 405 SCMS/GULA mass feeds
        additional retention requirements, during the I&S restructure file maintenance
        window, using TRC 33. This TRC must not be used by item managers to input
        retention requirements.
            2.11.5.7.2.1. D039/D200C are designed to build offsetting additive records for
            ASCs 048, 064, 068, 076, and 985 when the RAR master Section 1 authorized
            quantity is greater than zero. In this case, the RAR Section 4 additive will show a
            non-zero authorized quantity and an in-use quantity equal to zero; similarly, RAR
            Section 1 will contain an authorized quantity reduced to zero accompanied by a
            non-zero in-use quantity. Additives associated with maximum operating levels
            and ASCs 048, 064, 068, and 985 are identified by -PW, -48, -64, -68, -76, and
            985, respectively, in the last three positions of the ARID.
            2.11.5.7.2.2. Since 048 (EAID-retention item) and 064 (loan) are special ASCs,
            no repair or replacement requirements will be computed for these items. ASC 048
            assets are available to the IMS for shipment when needed to fill a valid
            requirement, since the equipment items requirements computation system is
            designed to reapply ASC 048 assets to valid requirements or to retain them when
            the item would have otherwise been stratified as excess.
            2.11.5.7.2.3. D039 is designed to retain all assets up to the maximum gross
            requirement through the computational cycle. However, in 2007, the AF
            contracted the Logistics Management Institute (LMI) to analyze that retention
            policy to determine whether the AF was retaining too many assets or too few
            assets. Their analysis compared the legacy design to alternative policies that
            retain assets above the maximum gross requirement. It was determined more cost

              effective to increase the retention level -- the benefit from not repurchasing items
              not retained was greater than the storage cost and repair cost to hold assets
              pending a future need. The AF Retention policy was changed and implemented in
              the 30 Jun 2008 computation. During the I&S Restructure file maintenance
              window, 405 SCMS/GULA calculates, creates, and passes mass Retention
              additives to 754 ELSG. These additives, covering an additional 50 percent above
              the gross requirement, are input using TRC 33 and are combined with the
              retention quantity D039 is designed to retain.
          2.11.5.7.3. TRC 34, Directed-to-Hold Unsuitable. Directed-to-hold unsuitable
          additives are manually or mechanically input. TRC 34 is to be used if the authorized
          NSN has a sequence code (also known as parts preference code) 4 or 9. If not, TRCs
          30 to 32 will be used. They will equal the quantity of unsuitable assets that the ALC
          has been directed to hold in support of a limited amount of items peculiar to an
          antiquated or technologically obsolete weapon systems. TRC 34 may also be used to
          hold available assets for maximum operating levels when they are input mechanically
          through C001 with -PW in the last three positions of the ARID. Directed-to-hold
          unsuitable additives represent part of the quantity on the unsuitable directed/elected-
          to-hold line of the PRA’s Buy/Budget Requirements Summary report (not part of the
          gross requirements).
          2.11.5.7.4. TRCs 35 through 37, Elected-to-Hold Suitable. Elected-to-Hold additive
          requirements reflect the minimum number of assets held in anticipation of satisfying
          future needs/ requirements. Input appears as Dir/Elect/Hold -AF on the PRA (not a
          part of the gross requirements).
          2.11.5.7.5. TRC 38 is not currently being used.
          2.11.5.7.6. TRC 39. Elected-to-Hold Unsuitable.
          2.11.5.7.7. Directed/Elected-to-Hold requirements are totaled in the directed/elected
          to hold lines of the PRA’s Buy/Budget Requirements Summary report.
              2.11.5.7.7.1. If the Disposal Deferred Code (DDC) (Section A, IMCD) is neither
              blank nor ―N,‖ the PRAs directed/elected-to-hold AF quantity is the sum of the
              non-aligned suitable warehouse and in-service quantities. Otherwise, the
              directed/elected-to-hold AF quantity is equal to the sum of TRCs 30 to 33, TRCs
              35 to 37, and the computed elected-to-hold requirement. Derived by RMS, the
              computed elected-to-hold requirement equals the highest gross requirement minus
              the gross requirement at the higher of the buy or budget position.
              2.11.5.7.7.2. If the IMCD, DDC is neither blank nor ―N,‖ the PRA’s unsuitable
              directed/ elected-to-hold quantity is the sum of unsuitable warehouse and
              unsuitable in-service quantities. Otherwise, the unsuitable directed/elected-to-hold
              quantity is the lesser of the sum of the unsuitable warehouse and in-service
              quantities, or the sum of TRC 34 and TRC 39 quantities.
Notes:
1. TRC 34 is to be used if the authorized NSN has a sequence code (also known as parts
preference code) 4 or 9. If not, TRCs 30 to 32 will be used.
2. Derived by RMS, the computed elected-to-hold requirement equals the highest gross

       C001 for all requisition document numbers which begin with the letter ―E‖ (contractor).
       MAJCOM is listed as ―1M,‖ AFMC, and MDS is listed as ―CONTRAC‖ for TRC 65.
       Input appears on the additive line of the PRA.
       2.11.5.15. TRC 66 is not currently being used.
       2.11.5.16. TRCs 67 through 68, Other Contractor Additives. These TRCs apply to
       contractor requirements not covered by codes 60 through 66 or 69. Input appears on the
       additive line of the PRA.
       2.11.5.17. TRC 69, Bailment/Loan Additives. These additive requirements are created
       from records received, via C001, from J041 each computation cycle. TRC 69 is located
       on RAR, Section 4 as a double-line entry; the second line contains contract number,
       return date (FY and quarter), and SRAN. The IMS must validate TRC 69 additive
       requirements for any item with a buy or budget requirement. The IMS cannot input TRC
       69 records. Input appears on the additive line of the PRA.
       2.11.5.18. TRCs 70 through 79, Training Additives. The AETC may require a limited

     than one year old. Input appears on the additive line of the PRA.
     2.11.5.20. TRC 81, IMS Initial Additive. IMS initial additives are those initiated by the
     IMS for backordered requisitions with advice codes ―6H‖ or ―6J‖ if the requisition is for
     an item supporting an MDS listed in the IBM table. IMS additives must be validated
     quarterly to ensure they do not duplicate other requirements which are reported through
     AFEMS or other sources. Documentation used in the validation process will not be more
     than one year old. Input appears on the additive line of the PRA.
     2.11.5.21. TRC 82, SERD Additive. SERD additives are file maintained to cover known
     future requirements not yet identified by the using MAJCOMs. They must be reviewed
     quarterly to ensure they do not duplicate other requirements which are reported through
     AFEMS. Input appears on the additive line of the PRA.
     2.11.5.22. TRC 83, Operating Support Levels. ALCs will maintain documentation on
     the authorization of operating support levels. Input appears on the additive line of the
     PRA (reference para 1.22.1).
     2.11.5.23. TRC 84-89, Other SM Additives. Other SM additives are file maintained with
     coordination of the appropriate SM, and are to be reviewed quarterly to ensure they are
     still current and do not duplicate other requirements which are reported through AFEMS.

     appears on the additive line of the PRA.
     2.11.5.24. TRC 90, Alternate Mission Equipment (AME) Installed Losses. These
     balances are created from records received from C001 each quarterly computation cycle
     (not received for update cycles). They are mechanically entered in RAR Section 4 as
     additive requirements offset by assets. Note: Research will be performed to determine
     whether it is an appropriate additive requirement, or whether it duplicates EAID-
     accountable authorizations. Input appears on the additive line of the PRA.
     2.11.5.25. TRC 91, AF538 Non-Reported Losses. AF538 non-reported losses are
     created from records received from C001 each quarterly computation cycle (not received
     for update cycles). They are mechanically entered in RAR Section 4 as additive
     requirements offset by assets. Input appears on the additive line of the PRA.
     2.11.5.26. TRC 92, Real Property Installed Equipment (RPIE). RPIE is created from
     records received from C001 each quarterly computation cycle (not received for update
     cycles). It is mechanically entered in RAR Section 4 as additive requirements offset by
     assets. Input appears on the additive line of the PRA. Note: AME, AF538, and RPIE
     balances are created from records received from C001 each quarter. They are
     mechanically entered in RAR, Section 4 as additive requirements offset by assets. The
     replacement requirements computed against these categories are shown on the
     replacement line of PRA products.
     2.11.5.27. TRCs 93 through 99, Other IMS Replacement Additives. The IMS will use
     TRCs 93-99 to input additive requirements and assets not covered elsewhere. These
     additive requirements will be reflected on the replacement requirement line of the PRA
     beginning with the second program positions. IMS additives must be validated quarterly
     to ensure they do not duplicate other requirements which are reported through AFEMS or
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                       47


      other sources. Documentation used in the validation process will not be more than one
      year old. Use TRC 94 to establish additives for backordered requisitions with advice
      code ―6E.‖ Input appears on the replacement requirements line of the PRA (reference
      para 2.11.5).
   2.11.6. The IMS can input additive asset and dated forecast records not reported through
   normal channels into the additive file, RAR, Section 4. However, manual input of TRCs 10-
   15, 17-19, 25-37, 39-41 must show zeros in the ―Asset Quantity‖ field, except when the first
   position of the requisition number is ―D‖ or ―F.‖
   2.11.7. The Accountable Officer must submit requirements for equipment to support special
   projects applicable to the MAJCOM, base, and organization (reference AFMAN 23-110, V2,
   P2,            C22,            para           22.161.(           at           http://www.e-
   publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/PUBS/AF/23/23011002/020222/020222.pdf).
   However, many special projects do not fall under the jurisdiction of a MAJCOM and its
   COSs. Therefore, requirements personnel can manually input requirements to the
   computation for these non-reporting special projects. Special projects may affect the asset
   and requirement quantities used in computing equipment-type items. Some projects which
   authorize dropping accountability of assets when an item is shipped will not be identified by
   an additive requirement. Special funds available for items shipped on special projects allow
   the IMS to replace assets shipped. Local use of these funds will be considered in the
   adjustment of assets and addition of requirements to the equipment item computation.
   2.11.8. All assets applied against additive requirements are included in the computation of
   replacement requirements, with the exception of those TRCs specified as no-computed
   replacement in RMS’s TRT.
2.12. PULE. PULE is a forecasting technique developed to mechanically compute replacement
requirements based on the computation of forecasted condemnation quantities.
   2.12.1. The Table 2.2. reflects the data elements PULE uses to determine specific quantities
   by FY.

Table 2.2. PULE Data Elements
Element           Definition
Age Group         FY in which the item was purchased and/or put into service.
Quantity          Acquired quantity by each age group.
Life Expectancy   Anticipated age, expressed in years, at which time the item will be retired
                  from inventory due to declining performance and/or excessive repair costs.
Life Maximum      Estimated life, in years, for mandatory replacement of the item.
Probability of    Estimated percent of items condemned at mandatory replacement age.
Condemnation      Normally only 10 percent or fewer of the items will survive to this age.
                  Therefore, the percentage will usually be expressed as 0.95, a figure which
                  experience has shown to produce the most favorable Bell curve.

   2.12.2. The PULE method is based on the premise that condemnations on most items do not
   occur on a linear basis, but occur rather sparingly in the early time periods and build up
   heavily when average life expectancy is reached, to taper off again by the time maximum life
   is reached.
   2.12.3. To computerize the features of a so called ―normal distribution‖ in the system, the
   ―Gaussian‖ or ―normal‖ distribution curve is used. A typical distribution curve would look
   like this.

  2.12.4. It is possible to manually establish a requirements computation for replacements
  based on projected condemnations in the exact manner used by the computer. This is done
  by using two tables (Table 2.3 and Table 2.4) and developing a simulation in the following
  manner.

      2.12.4.1. Establish basic data:
          2.12.4.1.1. FY of computation - 2009;
          2.12.4.1.2. Procured quantity - 62 each;
          2.12.4.1.3. Age group - FY02;
          2.12.4.1.4. Life expectancy - 13 years;
          2.12.4.1.5. Life maximum - 20 years; and
          2.12.4.1.6. Probability of Condemnation - 0.95.
      2.12.4.2. Table 2 4. shows how above data are computed mathematically. Values of
      column P are found in Table 2.3.
   2.12.5. Mechanized PULE. A mechanical computation can include other NSNs in the same
   computation as well as additional quantities of the same NSN, acquired in different lots and
   at different times. Attachment 4 shows a PULE computation including many different
   quantities and acquisitions. To ensure proper computational results, complete and accurate
   information must be supplied.
      2.12.5.1. The replacement criteria code in IMCD Section A must be file maintained as a
      ―B‖ or ―D.‖
      2.12.5.2. IMCD Section E must be file maintained with data for every FY’s procurement
      (age group): age group, procurement quantity, annual usage, average life expectancy,
      maximum life expectancy, probability of condemnation. Note: Annual usage of 2040 is
      based upon eight hours per day, 255 days per year.
      2.12.5.3. Replacement quantities are also shown on the WSP and will be file maintained
      for quarters 2 through 17. Replacement factors are developed by dividing the total
      acquired quantities of all NSNs in the PULE computation into the computation group
      replacement quantities. When developing actual time-phased replacement quantities, the
      computer uses the PULE factor for each time position within the FY and computes
      replacement by detail record (for each reporting organization in the computation).
          2.12.5.3.1. Multiplying the applied/reapplied, allocated/reallocated quantity by factor
          for each program position.
          2.12.5.3.2. Applying rounding factor (fraction) starting with 0.5 and carrying fraction
          over to next asset record which results in whole number replacement quantity.
      2.12.5.4. The system will not compute replacement requirements for assets applied to
      non-vehicle WRM, SAP, special ASCs, retention requirements, and replacement additive
      requirements.
Note: PULE uses original quantity acquired on IMCD computation. However, on the WSP, the
replacement line is built on in-service assets.
      2.12.5.5. Modified PULE. This method has been developed to compute replacement
      requirements for an entire fleet and to methodically replace this fleet due to age and
      obsolescence. Condemnations are not necessarily a factor in this method because certain
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                      53


       equipment is expected to operate 24 hours per day, with backup redundancy available.
       Communication, electronics, and meteorological equipment are generally classified in
       this category. When replacement criteria codes ―B‖ or ―D‖ are used, adequate PULE
       data must be available in IMCD Section E to calculate a replacement factor. Use an
       annual usage field of 9999 to trigger a modified PULE computation. The modified
       PULE delays its projection until one year prior to life expectancy and is used to suppress
       replacement during the early life years.
2.13. RMS Output. RMS produces a host of on-line and hard copy products which are
available to the user. Several products containing price data provide the capability to depict
standard price or escalated standard price. Note: When the price escalation option is used,
escalated standard price is depicted with an asterisk (*) following the standard price (e.g., ―STD
PRC 654324*‖).
   2.13.1. On-line Displays. The following products are available through on-line displays.
   IMCD, RAR, Notepad, IMS, OAA, WSP, PRA, IDSS, IA, MPPC, NRL IV, as well as
   requirements and edit tables such as EFT, MAJCOM Table (MCT), SRAN Table (SRT),
   TRT, and Valid Changes. Selection screens allow the user to display all of a product’s data
   or a subset of information. Additionally, data query may be used to extract data from the
   data base and to tailor/structure that data to satisfy individual user needs.
   2.13.2. On-line Report Selection. Rather than viewing products on-line, the user may elect
   to print a hardcopy (paper) report. To do this, the user chooses the product and parameters to
   be printed through selection screens, submits a print request through RMS’s CA Dispatch
   software, reviews the information available, and routes the print job to the printer of their
   choice. Spawning a job to the printer will allow the user to continue other on-line activities
   while the print job is running in batch mode. The first page of all reports will reflect the
   parameters selected by the user.
       2.13.2.1. The following hard copy reports may be generated via on-line request and may
       be produced in total or in sections: IMCD, RAR, Notepad, OAA, WSP, RIA, AR SNV,
       NSV, VI, ARS, VCNP, NRL, PRA, IDSS, IA, MPPC, and IV.
       2.13.2.2. Equipment Stock Number Change Listing and OAA Listing are designated as
       ―push products‖ and are set up in CA Dispatch to be distributed to the appropriate using
       organization each applicable computation cycle.
   2.13.3. Products and Tables.
       2.13.3.1. Item Manager Control Data (IMCD). The IMCD is generated each quarterly
       cycle immediately following the D200E snapshot. It contains up to five sections (A
       through E) and provides basic item information (Managing ALC, IMS, ES, division,
       budget program, actual NSN, SGM and I&S master NSNs, nomenclature, price, rates and
       factors, codes, usage and asset history data, lead time, manufacturing and repair data).
       On-line file maintenance transactions will be used to update the IMCD as needed, except
       when RMS data is being loaded or computed. File maintenance of Section A Continued
       will be used to update MPPC data and termination codes. For more details, reference
       Chapter 3.
       2.13.3.2. Reported Assets and Requirements (RAR). For quarterly processing cycles,
       RAR is produced via RMS following the D039/C001 interface. RAR contains up to nine
54                                                          AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011


     sections and provides a detailed listing of authorizations and assets which will be used in
     the computation. RAR provides visibility of actual and SGM NSNs, reporting SRAN
     and MAJCOM, authorized and in-service quantities for peacetime and WRM, warehouse
     assets by condition and other asset data, applicable forecast data, MDS, additive
     requirements, reported ASCs and other codes, gains and losses, and asset reduction
     records. On-line file maintenance transactions will be used to update the RAR; however,
     Sections 1 through 3 will only be file maintained during the semiannual cycle. Section 4,
     Additive Requirements Data, will be file maintained as needed, except during RMS
     equipment-data loads. Additive TRCs 25-29, 30-34, and 35-39 will affect long supply
     data in the IDSS product. Note: RAR file maintenance only effects the reported position
     until D039 applies those changes to the out-year positions. For more details, reference
     Chapter 5.
     2.13.3.3. Valid Changes/Notepad (VCNP)
        2.13.3.3.1. Valid Change Listing. The valid change listing logs all valid changes
        which have been file maintained between processing cycles for selected products.
        The report shows the field that was changed, the original value, and the latest value
        by SGM. The valid change listing may be requested in total or in part depending
        upon the selection criteria exercised by the user. Valid Change Listings are available
        for the following products. IMCD Sections A through E, RAR Sections 1 through 4,
        WS, Sections 1 and 2, and I&S Restructure.
        2.13.3.3.2. Notepad. VCNP presents explanatory narratives entered by the item
        manager. It is especially useful for communicating reasons for file maintenance
        actions, special management procedures, and documenting unit costs, lead times,
        funded/on-order assets, and additives. It will contain pertinent information relating to
        the NSN, and the resulting management decisions. There are five screens available
        for each SGM. Data on the first screen will be carried over to each subsequent cycle;
        data on the last four screens will reside with the cycle current at the time of input.
        The Notepad is available for the following products: IMCD Sections A through E;
        RAR Sections 1 through 4; WSP Sections 1 and 2; and I&S Restructure.
     2.13.3.4. Item Management Statistics (IMS). This product can be obtained via on-line
     display only. Equipment IMS is produced immediately following the D200E snapshot
     and provides the number of actual stock numbers, number of SGM NSNs, and the
     number of I&S master NSNs by ALC, division, and Inventory Management Specialist
     (IMS) in the equipment-item process, based upon criteria selected.
     2.13.3.5. Over-Age Additives (OAA). The OAA listing is a ―push‖ product which
     identifies additive requirements that will be more than a year old by 31 Mar or 30 Sep.
     All IMS additive requirements more than one year old will be purged from the next
     computation cycle unless a change action is accomplished to revalidate the additive
     requirement. Mechanically created additives are only valid for the current cycle and are
     recreated each cycle as required.
     2.13.3.6. SRAN Table (SRT). The SRT lists equipment applicable SRANs, with their
     corresponding area codes and base names, as well as the last date the table was modified.
     Invalid SRANs will appear on the Authorization and Asset Master Exception listing and
     will default to ―8999‖ on other products. The SRT is updated by the 405 SCMS/GULA.
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                   55


     2.13.3.7. MAJCOM Table (MCT). The MCT lists valid two-position MAJCOM codes
     and three-position MAJCOM abbreviations. Unknown MAJCOMs are designated as
     ―ZZ‖ or ―0#.‖ The MCT is maintained by the 405 SCMS/GULA.
  2.13.3.8. Type Requirements Table (TRT). The TRT is maintained by the 405
  SCMS/GULA, and lists valid TRC that can be file maintained in RAR Section 4. The TRT
  displays the most recent date of table modification and lists all TRCs with their
  corresponding additive identifications (descriptions), OPSD, Apply Additive Asset to
  Authorization Indicator, Compute Additive Replacement Requirement Indicator, and account
  identification.
     2.13.3.9. Initial Requirements/BP/MDS (IBM) Table. The IBM table is maintained by
     the 405 SCMS/GULA, and contains the budget program (BP) and MDS combinations
     which constitute initial requirements.
     2.13.3.10. Equipment Stock Number Change Listing. The Equipment NSN Change
     listing is a ―push‖ product generated quarterly in hard copy and is routed to each ALC
     and to the 405 SCMS/GULA Equipment OPR. Produced following the D200E snapshot,
     it contains actual, SGM, and I&S master NSNs which have been added, transferred,
     consolidated, changed, or deleted since the last cutoff date. Changes to ALC site,
     manager designator codes (division and IMS), OOU, JTC, and phrase codes also appear
     on the listing. Old and new asset history data are listed by the current ALC site ID,
     division designator, and IMS. Deleted NSN data is listed by the old ALC, division, and
     IMS.
     2.13.3.11. Weapon System Product (WSP). WSP is partitioned into six sections, each of
     which contains gross requirements, aligned assets, and net requirements. Gross
     requirements are broken out by AF initial, Communications Electronics Authorization
     Program (CAP), additive, WRM, and replacement. Aligned assets are broken out by in-
     use, in-place, warehouse serviceable and unserviceable, and funded on-order. Up to nine
     program positions are provided by quarter and FY: reported, current operating, buy, and
     six budget positions. The WSP is unique in their treatment of the MDS selection criteria;
     given proper spacing/structuring, if a mission and design (MD) are entered, then
     corresponding records for all series (i.e., MDSs) for the MD will be output. Section 1
     quantities are stratified by MDS and MAJCOM. Section 2 quantities are stratified by
     MAJCOM. Section 3 quantities are stratified by MDS. Section 4 contains SGM totals.
     Section 5 summarizes excess (non-aligned) asset quantities by suitability. Section 6
     provides the dollar summary. For Section 6, if the price escalation option is selected,
     note that the standard price is escalated to the applicable program position. Products may
     be tailored based upon criteria selected.
     2.13.3.12. Weapon System (WS) File Maintenance Product. The WS is partitioned into
     two sections: Section 1 requirements and aligned assets stratified by MDS and
     MAJCOM; and Section 2 summarized excess (non-aligned) asset quantities by
     suitability. Mainly, the WS file maintenance is accomplished on the quarterly
     computations (December and June) and after the semiannual (March and September)
     update cycles are loaded. WS file maintenance will affect the IDSS and PRA products.
     When gross requirements, aligned assets, and excess (non-aligned) assets are file
     maintained, the system will realign assets to requirements so it is not necessary to file
56                                                         AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011


     maintain all three categories. The current and previous cycle can be file maintained.
     Only two computation cycles are available at a time.
     2.13.3.13. Net Requirements by Location (NRL). The NRL contains up to eight sections
     stratifying gross requirement, aligned asset, and net requirement quantities across eleven
     program positions. NRL products may be tailored based upon the following selection
     criteria: SGM or I&S master NSN, ALC, Division, IMS, Section, MAJCOM, SRAN,
     BP, System Management Code (SMC), MPC, and dollar ranges.
        2.13.3.13.1. Section 1 stratifies quantities by MAJCOM and SRAN.
        2.13.3.13.2. Section 2 provides SRAN totals.
        2.13.3.13.3. Section 3 stratifies quantities by MAJCOM and WRM base code.
        2.13.3.13.4. Section 4 provides WRM totals.
        2.13.3.13.5. Section 5 stratifies additive requirement quantities by MAJCOM.
        2.13.3.13.6. Section 6 provides additive totals.
        2.13.3.13.7. Section 7 stratifies data by MAJCOM
        2.13.3.13.8. Section 8 provides SGM summary totals.
     2.13.3.14. Projected Requirements and Assets (PRA). PRA is an SGM NSN summary
     of the results of the computation, and has two parts: Requirements/Assets and
     Buy/Budget Requirements. Automatic hard copy products are provided to the ALCs
     following initial and update computations when items are in a buy, budget, or termination
     status. Note: File maintenance accomplished in the IMCD may impact the PRA in the
     next computation; file maintenance accomplished in the RAR may impact the PRA in the
     subsequent update computation; whereas file maintenance of WS products may impact
     the PRA immediately.
        2.13.3.14.1. The Requirements and Assets portion stratifies gross requirements,
        assets, and net requirements, quantities across nine program positions.
            2.13.3.14.1.1. Gross requirements are categorized by AF initial, CAP initial, Air
            National Guard (ANG) initial, Air Force Reserve (AFR) initial, WRM,
            Replacement, and Additive. Note: ―Air Force initial‖ includes all MAJCOM
            requirements (within SGM NSN) except MAJCOM 4Z (ANG) and MAJCOM
            0M ([AFR] requirements, (4Z and 0M are two –position MAJCOM codes found
            in the MCT). ―AFR initial‖ provides 0M requirements. ―ANG initial‖ provides
            4Z requirements. The WRM requirement does not include WRM additive
            requirements. WRM additive requirements are included in the additive line of
            PRA. A consolidation indicator (two asterisks) following net requirements (i.e.,
            ―NET RQMTS**‖) is used to signify that the net requirements for an I&S master
            have been consolidated with subgroup item requirements.
            2.13.3.14.1.2. Assets are categorized as in-use, in-place, warehouse serviceable,
            warehouse unserviceable, and funded on-order. In-use assets are considered
            peacetime assets; whereas in-place assets are considered WRM assets. Note:
            Warehouse serviceable assets include assets reported in transit no matter the
            condition.
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                      57


            2.13.3.14.1.3. The nine program positions include the reported, current operating,
            buy, and six budget positions. Every PRA, in a cycle, has the same reported and
            current operating positions; however, the buy and six budget positions will vary
            depending on the procurements lead time file maintained in the IMCD Section A.
        2.13.3.14.2. The Buy/Budget Requirements section provides dollar stratifications of
        net requirements, price without FDT charges, standard price, initial spares costs,
        technical data costs, and other costs across the buy and six budget positions. Note: If
        the price escalation option is selected, the standard price is escalated to the applicable
        program position. The Buy/ Budget Requirements product also provides buy net
        requirements; previous computation buy, budget, and excess data; as well as SGM
        long supply data and item information. The SGM long supply data includes:
        authorized supply level; deferred disposal quantity; directed/elected-to-hold data;
        termination, retention, and excess data; and unsuitable asset data. Note: The
        authorized supply level is the sum of TRCs 40, 41, and 83. The item information
        includes lead time, factors, codes, repair data, total acquired, gains, and losses.
     2.13.3.15. Item and Dollar Summary Stratification (IDSS). The IDSS is comprised of
     four sections. If a SGM NSN is selected, the SGM and I&S master NSN, replacement
     factor, managing ALC, division, IMS, budget program, standard price, and DDC; and
     sections one through three will provide item data in quantities as well as dollars. If an
     SGM NSN is not specified, the stratification will provide a dollar summary. If the price
     escalation option is selected, standard price is to be escalated to the applicable program
     position. Note: WS file maintenance products may impact the IDSS.
        2.13.3.15.1. Section 1, entitled ―Gross/Aligned/Buy/Budget Assets‖ stratifies gross
        requirement (WRM, overseas (O/S), zone of the interior (Z/I), additive), in-service
        assets (in-place, O/S, Z/I), warehouse serviceable and unserviceable assets (O/S, Z/I,
        depot), funded on-order assets, total assets, net requirements, and adjusted buy/budget
        requirements across reported, current operating, buy and budget positions, as
        applicable. This section depicts the Approved Force Acquisition Objective (AFAO)
        requirements and assets.
        2.13.3.15.2. Section 2, Buy/Budget Segmented Requirements, stratifies AF, AFR and
        ANG initial, CAP (always zero), WRM, replacement, and additive requirements;
        aligned assets; net requirements; and net AFR and ANG replacement quantities at the
        buy and budget positions. Note: AFR data relates exclusively to data with the two-
        position MAJCOM code of 0M, and that ANG data corresponds to the 4Z MAJCOM
        code.
        2.13.3.15.3. Section 3, Long Supply, stratifies gross requirement and total assets, as
        well as, in service, warehouse, and funded on-order assets by economic retention,
        contingency retention and total long supply. The economic and contingency retention
        are each subdivided by directed-to-hold, elected-to-hold, and excess. Note: Section
        3 data is derived at the higher of the buy or budget positions, and that the standard
        price listed on the product’s header is the buy-position standard price.
        2.13.3.15.4. Section 4, SGM Totals, provides the total number of SGM NSNs and the
        total NSN count. It also provides the number of SGMs computing termination, buy,
        budget, budget+1, excess, and retention. The standard price listed on the product’s
58                                                          AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011


        header is the buy-position standard price. The bottom of the product provides
        visibility of computed elected-to-hold quantity, AF elected-to-hold quantity, and
        contractor requirement. Computed elected to hold quantity is the highest gross
        requirement less the gross requirement at the higher of the buy or budget position.
        AF elected-to-hold quantity is the sum of TRCs 35 through 37 and 39. Contractor
        requirement lists the dollar value of TRCs 60 through 69.
     2.13.3.16. Basic Index of Actions (IA). The Basic IA is a push product generated
     following each quarterly and semiannual update computation. It contains SGM NSNs
     which have computed termination, buy, budget, budget+1, excess, and/or retention
     quantities. It is sorted by ALC, division, and IMS, with termination, buy, budget,
     budget+1, excess, and retention dollars and quantities, as well as, total dollars and SGM
     count per category.
     2.13.3.17. Index of Actions (IA) Extracts. IA extracts are requested by the user (i.e., on-
     line invoked) and can be selected by various combinations of ALC, division, IMS, BP,
     SMC, MPC, FSC, FSG, MMAC, dollar ranges and file maintenance change indicators for
     items in termination, buy, budget, budget+ 1, excess, or retention. The product can be
     sequenced by descending dollars, by SGM within I&S, or by SGM. This product is
     extremely useful in alerting requirements personnel which items must be tended first.
     2.13.3.18. Repair Index of Actions (RIA).
        2.13.3.18.1. The Repair IA product is a listing of computed equipment-item repair
        requirements. It is system generated semiannually during the update cycle, but is also
        available to the user via on-line request by combinations of SGM or I&S master
        NSN, ALC, division, IMS, BP, SMC, MPC, MIEC, FSC, FSG, MMAC, as well as,
        dollar ranges of standard price and unit sales price. When RMS’s Repair Subsystem
        is implemented, the Repair IA will be sequenced using unit sales price times the
        repair quantity. However, prior to repair subsystem implementation, sequencing is
        from high to low repair requirements using standard price.
        2.13.3.18.2. File Maintenance of Equipment Item Repair Data. Repair data will be
        file maintained in IMCD Section B, which allows the user to file maintain the
        Equipment Essentiality Code (EEC) portion of the MIEC. Although there is repair
        data in IMCD Section D (Two Years Usage by actual NSN), it cannot be file
        maintained. This is for information only, showing the management team the repair
        data that D039 passes to D075, once the update computation has been run. All repair
        file maintenance in being accomplished in the ERR database or directly through
        ABCS. More information on the ERR can be found in Chapter 12.
     2.13.3.19. Inventory of Principal Items (IPI). IPI products are in the same format as the
     DD Form 1138-1, Inventory Report of Principal and Secondary Items, information which
     is included in the annual submission of the DD1000 Report. This report provides the
     inventory values (in thousands of dollars) for requirement and asset categories, and the
     NSN count for specified budget programs. IPI products will be selected by SGM NSN or
     by AFMC, WW, managing ALC, division, IMS, and budget program (BP). Note: At
     least one BP must be specified.
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                  59


       2.13.3.19.1. RMS provides requirements data in thousands of dollars for the
       following categories.
          2.13.3.19.1.1. An AFAO requirement is the sum of additive, CAP, replacement,
          WRM, and AF initial gross requirement quantities at the budget position,
          multiplied by the standard price of each SGM NSN.
          2.13.3.19.1.2. WRM is a subset of the AFAO requirement. To determine the
          WRM requirement, the WRM gross requirement quantity at the budget position
          has been multiplied by the standard price of each SGM and summed.
          2.13.3.19.1.3. Approved Force Retention Requirement: Not Applicable (N/A) in
          EIP.
       2.13.3.19.2. RMS provides in-use (including in-place) and in-store asset data in
       thousands of dollars for the following categories.
          2.13.3.19.2.1. Unstratified Stock: N/A in EIP.
          2.13.3.19.2.2. AFAO Assets. AFAO in-use asset inventory value is the sum of
          aligned additive, CAP (always zero), replacement, WRM, and AF Initial, in-use
          and in-place budget-position quantities, multiplied by the standard price of each
          SGM NSN. AFAO in-store asset inventory value is the sum of the following
          aligned warehouse serviceable and unserviceable, budget-position quantities;
          additive, CAP, replacement, WRM, and AF Initial, which have been multiplied by
          the standard price of each SGM.
          2.13.3.19.2.3. WRM Assets. WRM in-place inventory data is not provided
          because RMS classifies WRM ―in-use‖ inventory to include the value of WRM
          aligned in-use and in-place assets at the budget position.
          2.13.3.19.2.4. Approved Force Retention Stock: N/A.
          2.13.3.19.2.5. Economic Retention Stock is the dollar value of suitable assets
          which are to be retained by the AF; this information is computed at the higher of
          the buy or budget position. In-use inventory is the dollar value sum of directed-
          and elected-to-hold, in-service suitable assets. In-store inventory is the dollar
          value sum of warehouse serviceable and unserviceable, directed-and elected-to-
          hold, suitable assets.
          2.13.3.19.2.6. Contingency Retention Stock is the dollar value of unsuitable
          assets which are to be retained by the Air Force; this information is to be
          computed at the higher of the buy or budget position. In-use inventory is the
          dollar value sum of directed-and elected-to-hold, unsuitable, in-service assets. In-
          store inventory is the dollar value sum of directed-and elected-to-hold, warehouse
          serviceable and unserviceable, unsuitable assets.
          2.13.3.19.2.7. Numeric Retention Stock: N/A.
          2.13.3.19.2.8. Potential DoD Excess Stock is the dollar value of non-aligned,
          serviceable and reparable warehouse assets at the higher of the buy or budget
          position. In-use inventory is the dollar value sum of non-aligned, suitable and
          unsuitable, in-use and in-place assets, minus the dollar value of contingency and
60                                                         AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011


            economic retention in-use assets. In-store inventory is the dollar value sum of
            non-aligned, suitable and unsuitable, warehouse serviceable and unserviceable
            assets, minus the contingency and economic retention in store inventory value.
            2.13.3.19.2.9. Total Assets is the sum of Unstratified Stock, AFAO Stock,
            Approved Force Retention Stock, Economic Retention Stock, Contingency
            Retention Stock, Numeric Retention Stock, and Potential DoD Excess Stock.
            This total also equals the sum of United States (US), Foreign Countries and
            Afloat, and Outlying Areas of the US stock.
            2.13.3.19.2.10. US stock is the dollar value difference between Total Assets and
            Foreign Countries and Afloat stock.
            2.13.3.19.2.11. Foreign Countries and Afloat stock is the inventory value of
            overseas (O/ S) reported assets.
            2.13.3.19.2.12. Outlying Areas of the US: N/A in EIP.
        2.13.3.19.3. Number of Items is the number of actual NSNs in the subgroups being
        processed.
        2.13.3.19.4. As previously stated, the IPI is a basic report which lists data in the DD
        Form 1138-1. Typically, two March cycles of IPI data are compared and the
        differences are reported and explained in the DD1000 submission. RMS provides
        two IV products to compute the mathematical difference in data from two cycles.
            2.13.3.19.4.1. The Budget Program Variance products provides the difference
            and percent difference from data meeting the BP selection. The categories
            depicted in this product are the same categories depicted in the IPI; however, this
            report reflects data from two cycles as well as the difference between those cycles
            and the percentage they are different.
            2.13.3.19.4.2. SGM Variance product provides a list of SGM NSNs, IMS, deltas,
            and percent delta for selected categories. This product is especially useful in
            researching NSNs which have attributed to the greatest change (increase or
            decrease) per category.
     2.13.3.20. Materiel Procurement Program Control (MPPC). MPPC provides buy,
     budget, and budget+1 adjusted net requirement quantities and dollars, and allows the user
     to assign buy and budget priorities by file maintaining IMCD Section A Continued.
     Product selection criteria are as follows: ALC, division, IMS, BP, SMC, cost, and range
     categories. Selection of upper and middle range categories will result in the report
     provided by SGM. The report will structure one SGM per page for the upper-range
     selection and three SGMs per page for the middle-range selection. The lower range
     option will provide a product by FSC/MMAC. Default value for the lower range is ―less
     than $100,000;‖ default for upper range is ―greater than $900,000.‖ Note: AFR data
     relates exclusively to data with the two position MAJCOM code of 0M, and that ANG
     data corresponds to the 4Z MAJCOM code. If price escalation option is selected, the
     text, ―DOLLARS ESCALATED,‖ will appear under the ―as of‖ date.
     2.13.3.21. Asset Reconciliation (AR) Products. AR products are automatically produced
     semiannually (31 March and 30 September update cycles) for equipment items that have
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                    61


     a computed buy, budget, or termination quantity and an extended dollar value of
     $100,000 or more. Products are produced quarterly for equipment items which have
     asset variances, unit cost of $300,000 or more, and/or an inventory value of $10,000,000
     or more. The following two paragraphs brief asset reconciliation products. For more
     detail, reference Chapter 9.
        2.13.3.21.1. Asset Reconciliation (AR) Worksheet. This product is the mechanized
        equivalent of the Format 305, and is used to document corrections to asset counts and
        to produce a new baseline for asset accounting. The report can also be selected by
        I&S, ALC, DIV, IMS, BP, SMC, MPC, and dollar cost ranges of buy, budget,
        termination, inventory, or variance. File maintenance accomplished in IMCD
        Sections B and C, RAR Sections 1 through 4, and WS Sections 1 and 2 may impact
        the AR.
        2.13.3.21.2. Asset Reconciliation List for Equipment Items. This list contains actual
        NSNs, by ALC, division and IMS, for which asset reconciliation worksheets were
        printed. It shows the variance percentage, the variance cost, the buy dollars, budget
        dollars and termination dollars for each NSN. This list can be used to ensure that the
        items causing the largest variances are the ones that will be worked. The report will
        be produced using the criteria mentioned above, for NSNs where the IMS total
        acquired does not equal the reported assets plus the losses.
     2.13.3.22. Equipment Asset Variances. There are two Equipment Asset Variance reports
     which provide dollar differences from the previous March to the current cycle:
     Equipment Asset Variance by Actual Stock Number (SNV) and Equipment Asset
     Variance by SRAN (NSV).
        2.13.3.22.1. Equipment Asset Variances By Actual Stock Number (SNV). This
        product lists NSNs where the number of total acquired assets has changed since the
        last March update cycle. This product lists standard price, assets available, lost, and
        total for the previous March cycle; available, lost, and total for the current cycle;
        dollar variance (i.e., mathematical difference from previous March update to current
        cycle); variance percent; and variance cost for each actual NSN. This report can be
        selected by various combinations of SGM, I&S, ALC, DIV, IMS, BP, SMC, MPC,
        plus or minus variance, and dollar range of the variance.
            2.13.3.22.1.1. Total available asset quantity is the sum of in-service assets, TOC
            asset quantity, warehouse serviceable (without TOC) quantity, warehouse
            unserviceable quantity.
            2.13.3.22.1.2. Total loss asset quantity is the sum of SAP loss quantity, non-
            reported asset loss quantity, installation asset losses quantity, modification asset
            losses quantity, redistribution and marketing asset loss quantity, other asset loss
            quantity, and condemnation asset loss quantity.
            2.13.3.22.1.3. Total acquired asset quantity is the sum of total available asset
            quantity and total loss asset quantity.
            2.13.3.22.1.4. Variance is total acquired asset quantity for the current cycle minus
            total acquired asset quantity for the previous March update cycle.
62                                                         AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011


            2.13.3.22.1.5. Variance percent is the variance divided by the total acquired asset
            quantity for the previous March update cycle multiplied by 100.
        2.13.3.22.2. Equipment Asset Variances by SRAN (NSV). This report is selected by
        actual NSN and lists the SRANs that have a change in the total available assets at that
        SRAN since the last March computation cycle. The report shows the previous March
        total available, the current cycle total available, the variance quantity, the variance
        percentage, and the variance cost. This report is useful in determining which bases
        attributed fluctuations in assets.
     2.13.3.23. Equipment Item Review Information, Additive Requirements Summary
     (ARS). This product will be selected if a Format 23 is required. Selection is by SGM or
     I&S master NSN. The report provides Additive Identification and MAJCOM, buy and
     budget position gross requirements, the amount of assets allocated against the additive,
     and the net requirement at the buy and budget position. This product can be used to track

     2.13.3.26. Asset History Losses Exception and Control Reports. The Asset History
     Losses exception report is spawned quarterly by RMS and is provided in hard copy to the
     405 SCMS/GULA Equipment OPR. This exception report is based on errors found in
     accepting data associated with asset reporting. The following asset loss data is edited.
     Condemnation asset loss reported-position quantity, installed asset loss reported-position
     quantity, modification asset loss reported-position quantity, non-reporting asset loss
     reported-position quantity, other asset loss reported-position quantity, and redistribution
     and marketing asset loss reported-position quantity. If these data elements are non-
     numeric, they will be flagged as erroneous and default to zero. The last page (Asset
     History Losses Control Report) summarizes the number of records read by RMS, the
     number of D039 records with errors, the number loaded, and the number of records
     dropped by RMS.
     2.13.3.27. Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group – Maintenance (CSAG-M)
     Requirement Exception and Control Reports. The CSAG-M requirement exception and
     control reports are delivered to the 405 SCMS/GULA Equipment OPR in hard copy, and
     are based on errors found in loading CSAG-M data from the Depot Maintenance
     Accounting and Production System (DMPAS). Only data with NSNs matching the actual
     NSN control file will be accepted. The exception report will list the erroneous actual
     item identification number (IIN) input value and the error message ―STOCK NUMBER
     NOT FOUND‖, as well as errors with the data element, date needed month (which will
     be a three-position alphabetic field). The last page (CSAG-M Requirement Control
     Report) summarizes the number of DMAPS records read, the number with errors, the
     number of records loaded into RMS, and the number of records dropped. (Records
     passing edits will appear on RAR, Section 5.)
     2.13.3.28. Valid Organization File Exception and Control Reports.              The Valid
     Organization File exception report is generated by RMS quarterly in hard copy for the
     405 SCMS/GULA Equipment OPR, and contains AFEMS errors identified as a result of
     the AFEMS/D039 interface. This exception report lists errors in the following
     information. Source MAJCOM, source and actual MDS, organization ID, SRAN, and
     composition code. The edits for this file typically do not cause records to be dropped. If
     MAJCOM and/or SRAN input data do not match codes listed on the MCT and/or SRT,
     these codes will default to ―0#‖ and to ―8999‖ respectively. The last page (Valid
     Organization File Control Report) summarizes the number of D039 records read, the
     number with errors, the number of records loaded into RMS, and the number of records

      number of D039 records read, the number with errors, the number of records loaded into
      RMS, and the number of records dropped.
   2.13.4. Data Query. Printed reports or the onscreen display of data will be generated via
   Data Query. Data Query can be used to tailor information to satisfy individual user needs.
2.14. System Operations. The system is processed in three basic configurations to provide
timely information to users.
   2.14.1. Computation Cycles-Quarterly Processing. Processing cycles 1, 4, 7, and 10 use data
   as of 31 December, 31 March, 30 June, and 30 September, respectively. In these cycles,
   control data and cataloging information are updated; current WW authorization and asset
   data are introduced; requirements are projected; assets are applied and allocated; gross and
   net requirements are determined; and output products are generated.
   2.14.2. Update Cycles-Semiannual Processing. Update processing cycles for 31 March and
   30 September are cycles 4U and 10U, respectively. In these cycles, selected control data
   elements and authorization/asset data shown on RAR are revised according to file
   maintenance transactions; gross and net requirements are recalculated; data in the master file
   are adjusted; and financial reports and data systems interface files are generated.
   2.14.3. File Maintenance Cycles. File maintenance of requirements tables (SRT, MCT, and
   TRT) will be updated as new information becomes available. IMCD file maintenance will be
   accomplished on an as required basis, and is prohibited only during RMS data loads. As
   indicated above, RAR file maintenance must be accomplished prior to processing update
   cycles. Additive requirements will also be updated according to file maintenance actions, and
   overage additives are produced in the March and September time frames to provide visibility
   of outdated additives which will be deleted by the system unless a change action is file
   maintained to keep the additive from being dropped from the system the next processing
   cycle. Note: The appropriate cycle and year are shown in the headers of each product
   generated.

                      ITEM MANAGER CONTROL DATA (IMCD)

3.1. IMCD Overview.
   3.1.1. Source Data. IMCD (for Section A, A Continued, B, and E) is generated via RMS
   each quarterly cycle immediately following the RIID snapshot. ―RIID snapshot‖ is
   terminology used to denote the internal interfacing of RMS subsystems, D200E and D200C.
   Note: D200E accepts data from D043 (which provides cataloging data) and from J041
   (which provides acquisition and lead time information), then makes this data available to the
   equipment subsystem at a specific point in time via the ―snapshot.‖ IMCD Sections C and D
   information for the current processing cycle will be loaded following the D039-AFEMS
   interface which supplies data to D200C; therefore, this data will be loaded concurrently with
   RAR data. If the RAR has not yet been loaded for the current processing cycle, IMCD
   Section C will contain the previous processing cycle’s data with the message ―(DATA
   FROM PREVIOUS QUARTER)‖ under the item name.
   3.1.2. Content. IMCD contains up to five sections (A through E) and provides basic item
   information (managing ALC, IMS, ES, division, budget program, actual NSN, SGM and I&S
   master NSNs, description, price, rates and factors, codes, usage and asset history data, lead
   time, manufacturing and repair data). A description of Section A through E is in Paragraph
   3.2, Paragraph 3.3, Paragraph 3.4, Paragraph 3.5, Paragraph 3.6, and Paragraph 3.7.
   3.1.3. Availability. IMCD is available on-line or in hard copy from RMS. Data will be
   displayed based upon criteria selected. SGM, I&S master or actual NSN, ALC, division,
   IMS, BP, SMC, MPC, section, reparable generations greater than zero, condemnations
   greater than zero, equipment specialist code, acquisition method code, replacement criteria
   code, materiel management aggregation code, or ranges (standard price, buy net dollar,
   budget net dollar, and/or production lead time).
   3.1.4. File Maintenance. On-line file maintenance transactions will be used to update the
   IMCD as needed, except when RMS equipment data is being loaded or computed. When
   feasible, file maintenance of IMCD Sections A and B will be conducted prior to restructuring
   I&S Gs. File maintenance of Section A Continued will be used to update MPPC data and
   termination codes. Note: A notepad entry must follow file maintenance of the IMCD to
   make changes permanent for the processing cycle. Notepad and valid change entries are
   available for review via the Valid Changes/Notepad (VCNP) option in RMS.
      3.1.4.1. Add. A unique SGM NSN and its accompanying data will be added to the
      IMCD; however, this NSN will be omitted from RMS with the processing of next
      ―D200E snapshot‖ unless a cataloging action has been completed to add the NSN to
      D043. To add a SGM NSN, a ―B‖ (for blank) must be input on the function line of the
      file maintenance screen; RMS will then overlay the function code with an ―A‖ for ―add.‖
      The user will then input a unique NSN, which is not currently resident on the data base.
          3.1.4.1.1. To ensure that the added NSN will be included in the equipment item
          requirements computation, it must be file maintained following the ―D200E
          snapshot,‖ but before D200C passes data to D039 to support the AFEMS interface.
68                                                          AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011


        To permanently input a new NSN, cataloging action must be made through D043;
        otherwise, the NSN will drop out of D200C the following processing (computation)
        cycle.
        3.1.4.1.2. Section A. The SGM NSN and its accompanying information (ALC;
        division; IMS code; ES code; equipment control code (EC); acquisition method code
        (AMC); AMC expiration date; ERRC code; and unit of issue) may be added to this
        section.
        3.1.4.1.3. Section B. The following data elements may be added to IMCD Section
        B: standard price, OOU, JTC, actual NSN, and source of supply (SOS). (For NSNs
        which have been added, the current date is mechanically assigned to the date of last
        purchase.)
        3.1.4.1.4. Section E. Actual NSN data may be added.
     3.1.4.2. Change or Add.
        3.1.4.2.1. Section A. The following data elements may be changed or added during
        IMCD file maintenance: Item Name (ITM NM), Budget Control Code, AAC,
        Administrative Lead Time (ADM), Production Lead Time (PROD), Disposal
        Deferred Code (DSP DEF), Procurement Agency (PRO AGY), Life Expectancy (LIF
        EXP), Replacement Criteria Code (RPL CRI), Replacement Factor (RPL FAC),
        Spares Factor (SP FAC), Technical Data Costs (TECH DATA COSTS), Other Costs
        (OTHER COSTS), SGM MIEC, Repair Cycle, Repair Location, Sub-System
        Application, and Defense Industrial Plant Equipment Center (DIPEC) indicator.
        3.1.4.2.2. Section A Continued. The following data elements may be changed via
        IMCD file maintenance: unit costs at buy, budget, and budget + 1; acceptance code;
        IMS MPC; termination code (TERMINATION CD); and priority 2 quantities.
        3.1.4.2.3. Section B. The following data elements may be changed or added to
        IMCD Section B: EEC; MIEC; standard price (STD PRICE); procurement date
        (PRCUR DATE); and fuels section data (FUELS SEC).
        3.1.4.2.4. Section C. The following data elements may be file maintained; however,
        changes to IMCD Section C will not affect any other section: IMS total acquired
        assets and asset loss quantities [SAP, non-reporting, installation, modification,
        condemnation, Defense Reutilization & Marketing Office (DRMO), and other].
        3.1.4.2.5. Section D. IMS repair rate factor, repair criteria code, repair selection code
        and the past eight quarters of data (in-use asset, condemnation, and reparable
        generation quantities) may be file maintained.
        3.1.4.2.6. Section E. The following data elements may be file maintained. Actual
        NSN, age group, procurement quantity, annual usage, average life expectancy,
        maximum life expectancy, and probability of condemnation. Changes to this section
        will recalculate projected replacements by actual NSN and SGM NSN, as well as,
        SGM NSN replacement factors and total procurement quantity.
     3.1.4.3. Delete. Only SGM NSNs which have been created via file maintenance will be
     deleted in D200C. SGM NSNs will be deleted via file maintenance by using the function

The following narratives provide additional descriptions of IMCD Section A data elements.
     3.2.1. SGM. Subgroup master NSN is comprised of a four-position numeric FSC, a nine-
     position National Item Identification Number (NIIN), and a two-position MMAC. File
     maintenance actions will be taken to add a SGM NSN provided it is a unique NSN (i.e., not
     currently residing in the data base). Note: Cataloging action must be taken to permanently
     add a NSN (reference para 2.7).
     3.2.2. I&S. Interchangeability and Substitutability Master NSN (reference para 2.7.).
     3.2.3. FY. The computation cycle indicator is comprised of the next two FYs following the
     processing cycle FY, as well as the cycle code. The cycle code corresponds to the processing
     cycle cutoff month followed by a ―U‖ to specify an update cycle. See Table 13.5 Note: The
     equipment item requirements computation is used to determine and submit budget plans and
     to execute buy plans. These two FYs represent the buy year and the budget year being
     planned and executed.
     3.2.4. BUD CD CTL. Controlled Budget Code is a file maintainable, ten-position field
     which is comprised of a two-position numeric BP code, a four-position SMC, and a four-
     position MPC.
        3.2.4.1. BP is used to identify the funding budget program and correlates to the
        accounting classification subdivision of the appropriation level (reference AFMAN 23-
        110,             V1,            P2,           C2             [at           http://www.e-
        publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/PUBS/AF/23/23011001/010202/010202.pdf]).
        The budget code (BC) from the D043 interface at the beginning of each cycle determines
        the BP that will be reflected before file maintenance actions occur. To ensure the file
        maintained BP is permanent, the BC must be file maintained in D043. See DOD
        4100.39M, V10, C3, Table 67 (at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/PDFs/Procedures/vol10.pdf)
        or AFMAN 23-110, V1, P4, C1, Attachment 1A-42 (at http://www.e-
        publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/PUBS/AF/23/23011001/010401/010401.pdf)
        for the correlation between the BC and BP, as well as the definitions.
            3.2.4.1.1. Budget Controlled Code (BUD CD CTL). Used in the IMCD and RAR
            report to indicate the funds used to support buy and budget requirements. It is
            comprised of ten positions. Refer to AFMAN 65-604 for additional information on
            the codes that make up the budget control codes. D039/D200C items use two types
            of budget control codes.
            3.2.4.1.2. Investment Item Budget Control Code. The first two positions of the
            investment item budget control code represent the BP; this is an overlay from the
            D043 budget code. The D043 budget code is one position. BP12 is budget code A.
72                                                         AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011


         BP84 is budget code M. Preponderance of usage determines the budget code. For
         example, if the item supports mostly aircraft systems and has less back shop use, then
         BP12 is applicable. If the BP is file maintained in IMCD, then the corresponding
         budget code will be changed in D143C.
         3.2.4.1.3. Positions three through six represent the Activity Code (AC), which is used
         to identify the funding line in the President’s budget. The BPAC is comprised of the
         BP and AC. This is an IMS entry (refer to AFMAN 65-604 at http://www.e-
         publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFMAN65-604.pdf for applicable BPACs
         or consult your BP’s funds manager).
         3.2.4.1.4. Positions seven through ten represent the MPC. This is an IMS entry. The
         MPC provides a subdivision of the accounting classification below the BPAC level.
         The MPC can be assigned to individual items by the BP’s funds manager. When the
         IMS is not sure which MPC to use, it is advisable that the BP funds manager be
         consulted.
         3.2.4.1.5. O & M (Operations and Maintenance) Item Budget Control Code. This
         budget control code indicates that beginning in FY06 O&M funding will be used to
         support the buy and budget requirements. Positions one through six represent the
         BPAC. Positions one through three represent the three digits (638) Element of
         Expense Investment Code (EEIC) where the MAJCOM support equipment O&M
         resides. Position four through six represent the first three digits of the previous
         investment BPAC (i.e., 120, 822, 837, 841, 844, etc.). If the item is new, positions
         four and five in the O&M BPAC are based on the preponderance of usage.
     3.2.4.2. The SMC is used as a method of identifying the item for which support is
     provided; however, the activity code, which indicates the funding line in the President’s
     Budget, is to be maintained in this field (a BPAC is comprised of BP and SMC). The
     BPAC Master List is published periodically by USAF/FM (reference AFMAN 65-604,
     Appropriation      Symbols       and       Budget      Codes      at       http://www.e-
     publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFMAN65-604.pdf).
     3.2.4.3. MPC identifies major elements of a weapon system and is used in the
     submission of financial estimates of direct acquisition cost for selected weapon systems,
     as well as, financial plans and budget estimates on a conventional basis. The MPC
     provides a subdivision of the accounting classification below the BPAC level. Reference
     DFAS-DE 7010.1-R, General Accounting and Finance Systems at Base Level (at
     https://dfas4dod.dfas.mil/library/pubs/70101R/dfasde70101r.pdf).
  3.2.5. CUR. Current calendar date and military time appear in this block.
  3.2.6. UPDATED. Calendar date and military time of the last file maintenance transaction
  made against the NSN for the processing cycle. Blanks indicate that no file maintenance
  action has been taken.
  3.2.7. AS OF. The processing cycle cutoff date is 31 Dec, 31 Mar, 30 Jun, or 30 Sep of the
  applicable CY.
  3.2.8. ITM NM. Item name is a 19-position element which describes the NSN.
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                   73


  3.2.9. ACT. Action code indicates the type of file maintenance action which was used to
  alter the data, where, ―A‖ indicates a NSN has been added; ―C‖ indicates data has been
  changed; and a blank action code indicates no file maintenance has been accomplished.
  Note: An ―X‖ indicates that I&S restructuring has taken place.
  3.2.10. AAC. AAC is a one-position alphabetic code indicating how and under what
  restrictions an item of supply will be acquired. These codes, as applicable to the IM SC&D
  system, are used primarily to determine the stocked versus non-stocked breakouts of various
  management products produced by the system. The predominant AAC used in the RMS for
  equipment items is code ―J‖ (non-stocked, centrally procured). Consult DoD 4100.39-M,
  V10, Table 58, (at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/PDFs/Procedures/vol10.pdf) or AFMAN 23-
  110,       V1,       P4,      C1,       Attachment       1A-54        (at      http://www.e-
  publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/PUBS/AF/23/23011001/010401/010401.pdf),
  Federal Logistics Information System (FLIS) Procedures Manual, for description of other
  AACs.
  3.2.11. MIL SPEC NO. Military Specification Number is the first 16 positions of the
  reference number logistics. A military specification is a document which provides
  performance specifications and materiel requirements.
  3.2.12. EC. Equipment Code (EC) is used to denote equipment items which require special
  controls and reporting. Reference AFMAN 23-110, V2, P2, C3, Table 3A1.21 (at
  http://www.e-
  publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/PUBS/AF/23/23011002/020203/020203.pdf). ―V‖
  (vehicles) is the predominant non-blank equipment code in D200C. The EC will be blank if
  none of the referenced codes apply.
  3.2.13. ADPE. ADPE code identifies an item of ADPE, or an item containing ADPE,
  regardless of assigned federal stock class. Reference AFMAN 23-110, V1, P4, C1,
  Attachment                  1A-57                   (at             http://www.e-
  publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/PUBS/AF/23/23011001/010401/010401.pdf)   for
  additional information.
  3.2.14. ES. Two-position Equipment Specialist (ES) code which originated from the D043
  system.
  3.2.15. LEAD TIME. Lead time plays an extremely important role in the computation of
  equipment items. Lead time will only be file maintained on an I&S Master NSN.
  Procurement lead time (also known as acquisition lead time) is comprised of administrative
  and production lead time, and is used by the system to determine buy and budget program
  positions.
     3.2.15.1. ADM. Administrative Lead time (ALT) is the period of time (in whole
     months) from the initiation of a purchase request/military interdepartmental purchase
     request (PR/MIPR) to date of contract or purchase order award. Every effort will be
     made to maintain realistic ALT values in the system. ALT must be reviewed and
     validated whenever an item computes a buy, termination, or repair requirement. In
     D200C, ALT has the standard value of ―00‖ if a contract can be awarded by the fourth
     quarter of the funding year. ALT greater than the standard value of zero will be justified
     (and will be file maintained in RMS) when a contract cannot be awarded by the fourth
74                                                          AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011


     quarter of the funding year (appropriation FY). Use the most recent PR/MIPR to
     determine ALT, unless the following exceptions apply.
        3.2.15.1.1. When the latest PR/MIPR was processed on an urgent or expedited basis
        or when the ALT experience is not considered realistic, use the last representative
        ALT or the ALT of a like item. Do not include unusual delays, such as funding
        freezes, extensive rework time, etc.
        3.2.15.1.2. When an incremented contract, multi-year, or other such contract that
        provides for subsequent options or orders, is available, base ALT on the time required
        to place the order or to exercise the option. Note: Before contract expires, ALT must
        be adjusted to reflect time required to obtain new or additional contract coverage.
        This adjustment must occur ―full ALT‖ before contract expiration.
        3.2.15.1.3. ALT for first time replacement buys will be based on similar items which
        have an established acquisition history.
     3.2.15.2. PROD. Production Lead time (PLT) is the time between the date of contract
     award (or purchase order) and the date of the first delivery of the production quantity.
     The production lead time default in RMS is seven months if PLT data is blank. PLT
     must be reviewed and validated whenever an item has a computed buy, termination, or
     repair requirement. In the absence of J041 mechanized input, PLT will be derived from
     the following sources.
        3.2.15.2.1. The latest acquisition history or other valid data available to the ALC will
        be used to determine PLT. When actual item history does not support the lead time
        input to RMS, sufficient justification must be documented in the item records for
        management reviews and audits.
        3.2.15.2.2. Contractor quotes of PLT may be used instead of actual history, but do
        not use contractor quotes if they are not realistic. If contractor quotes of PLT are
        available but not used, document the justification for not using them. Contractor’s
        quotes passed to RMS D200E from J041 include 15 days for transportation time.
        3.2.15.2.3. For a new item, PLT will be obtained from the contractor through local
        contracting and manufacturing representatives, or from a similar item which has an
        established PLT.
        3.2.15.2.4. Develop PLT as follows.
            3.2.15.2.4.1. Calculate the number of days between date of contract/purchase
            order award and date of first delivery. If this number is derived from a
            contractor’s quote, add 15 days to in transit time.
            3.2.15.2.4.2. Divide the result by 30 (days in a month). Consider the result
            (number of months) as PLT months.
     3.2.15.3. PROC. Procurement Lead time (also known as Acquisition Lead time) is the
     summation of administrative and production lead-times. This sum must be less than 100
     months or file maintenance against administrative and production lead-times will not pass
     system edits and will not be accepted. The acquisition lead time field is not file
     maintainable.
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                    75


  3.2.16. ACQ MTH. Acquisition Method Code (AMC) is a two-position code which
  indicates whether an item is eligible for competitive or direct (sole source) manufacturer
  procurement, and identifies the amount of technical screening applicable. This field is
  comprised of acquisition method code followed by acquisition method suffix code. An
  acquisition method code of ―1‖ or ―2‖ indicate competitive procurement; whereas, ―3‖ or ―4‖
  indicates sole source procurement from a single manufacturer is justified. Reference
  AFMAN 23-110, V1, P4, C1, Attachment (Atch 1A-50 (at http://www.e-
  publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/PUBS/AF/23/23011001/010401/010401.pdf), and
  DoD 4100.39-M, Vol10, Table 71.
     3.2.16.1. AMCs reflect the decision of the PICA as to the techniques of purchasing to be
     employed from a planned procurement review. These codes originate from Federal
     Logistics Information System (FLIS) and have the following data flows to the equipment
     subsystem: FLIS - D043, - D200E, and - D200C.
     3.2.16.2. Acquisition Method Suffix Code (AMSC) provides supplementary information
     indicating the primary reason why the acquisition method code was assigned for
     procurement. Reference AFMAN 23-110, V1, P4, C1, Atch 1A-50 (at http://www.e-
     publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/PUBS/AF/23/23011001/010401/010401.pdf)
     for the applicable suffix codes.
  3.2.17. AMC EXP DT. Acquisition Method Code Expiration Date is the month and year
  that the acquisition method code becomes invalid. The expiration date is a four-position field
  in the format MMYY and originates in FLIS. Note: If no AMC applies, the AMC expiration
  date is 0000.
  3.2.18. DSP DEF. The existence of an Item DDC (other than ―N‖ or blank) indicates that
  the normal disposal action of excess wholesale assets is to be deferred. Assets are classified
  as directed-to-hold if the item DDC is other than ―N‖ or blank. Reference Table 13.9 and
  AFMAN            23-110,           V3,       P1,         C9         (at       http://www.e-
  publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/PUBS/AF/23/23011003/030109/030109.pdf) and or
  the applicable codes, definitions, and uses.
  3.2.19. PRO AGY. Procurement agency is a two-position code which is file maintained to
  denote the agency having procurement cognizance/responsibility. The RMS DED contains
  codes under the logical name. The physical (database element) name is PRCUR-AGCY.
  Reference Table 13.13 for the RMS Data Element Dictionary (DED) definitions.
  3.2.20. LIF EXP. Average life expectancy is the anticipated age, expressed in years, at
  which items will be retired from inventory due to declining performance and/or excessive
  repair costs.
  3.2.21. RPL CRI. Replacement criteria code (RCC) indicates the technique to be used in
  computing replacement requirements. At least two quarters of in-use history with an average
  of ten or more assets, and at least one quarter of condemnations greater than zero is required
  for D039 to mechanically compute replacement quantities. Reference Table 13.18 for a list
  of RCCs and their definitions.
  3.2.22. RPL FAC. Replacement Factor is the percentage (expressed as a decimal) of the
  authorized assets that will need replacement during a given period. These replacement
  requirements are expected to result from anticipated field and/or depot-level condemnations.
76                                                            AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011


  The SGM replacement factor is computed as follows if adequate condemnation and in-use
  history data exist. The sum of eight quarters’ condemnation quantities for each NSN in the
  subgroup is divided by the sum of eight quarters’ in-use asset quantities for each NSN in the
  subgroup, and the result is multiplied by four. Replacement factors are to be file maintained
  for replacement criteria codes A and G. Note: The computer will assign a replacement
  factor of zero for the following reasons: if the equipment code is ―V‖ (vehicle); if inadequate
  condemnation and in-use history data is available or if the replacement criteria code is B, D,
  E, F, H, or blank.
  3.2.23. SP FAC. Spares Factor is a percentage expressed as a decimal, applied (or to be
  applied) to budget dollars for initial spare parts for maintenance -- do not confuse this with
  budgeting spare end items. The spares factor is expressed as a percentage of the unit cost of
  the end item. If the item will be acquired from competitive sources, or under military
  specifications, the spares factor will be used to budget for spare parts. If, when awarded, it is
  determined that the item will be identical or similar to an item already in the inventory, actual
  dollars budgeted for spare parts can be re-budgeted.
  3.2.24. TECH DATA COSTS. Technical data cost is the dollar cost for technical-data
  publication requirements and is not a unit but rather a total cost for acquisition.
  3.2.25. OTHER COSTS. Any other costs that are not included in the standard price or
  technical data costs. ―Other costs‖ is based upon cost per each unit.
  3.2.26. MIEC. Mission Item Essentiality Code of the SGM NSN. Note: The MIEC of the
  actual NSN is displayed and file maintainable in IMCD Section B.) MIEC is a three-position
  code assigned to each NSN. The MIEC is comprised of sub codes denoting system
  essentiality, equipment essentiality, and organizational essentiality. These essentiality codes
  will be used to allocate resources, by weapon system importance, at the NSN level.
  Essentiality criteria will be used to justify and to allocate funds, to help in the scheduling of
  items for repair, and to identify those items that are to be included in WRM stocks. The
  D200C system default for MIEC is ―6DG.‖
     3.2.26.1. SEC. System Essentiality Code (SEC), also known as the application
     essentiality code, is the first position of the MIEC and is computed using MDS. SEC
     discrete values are one through seven (system default is 6). Reference Table 13.19 for
     the applicable definitions.
         3.2.26.1.1. For conventional munitions equipment, the SEC is based on the highest
         priority value of the weapon system on which it is carried. For communications-
         electronics (C-E) equipment, the SEC is assigned to the application using the system
         networks. For support equipment, the SEC is based upon the highest numeric SEC of
         the aircraft/missile/engine to which it can be related.
         3.2.26.1.2. Once a year, the HQ OPR receives a list of weapon system (aircraft and
         missile) MDSs with their SECs from the HQ USAF Logistics Support Priority (LSP)
         computation. For applications other than aircraft and missiles (such as trainers and
         simulators), these applications will be related back to weapon systems (aircraft and
         missiles) whenever possible. Use the highest ranking SEC of the weapon systems.
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                     77


     3.2.26.2. Equipment Essentiality Code (EEC). EEC (the second position of the MIEC) is
     the equipment essentiality for aircraft and missile components, C-E equipment and
     support equipment.
         3.2.26.2.1. Valid equipment essentiality codes are A, B, C, or D (default is D).
         Reference Table 13.6 for equipment essentiality code definitions.
         3.2.26.2.2. The EEC needs to be file maintained if any value except the default value
         ―D‖ is needed. This code represents the importance of the NSN to the mission. An
         EEC of ―A‖ indicates that no mission can be completed without this NSN. ―B‖
         indicates that the majority of missions could not function without the item. ―C‖
         indicates that some missions could not function. ―D‖ indicates that the peacetime
         mission could not function without this item. The best way to file maintain the EEC is
         to use it as a heuristic to rank the importance of the item to the overall end mission
         whether this is a weapon system, a maintenance shop, a network, etc.
     3.2.26.3. Organizational Essentiality Code (OEC). The OEC is the third position of the
     MIEC and is derived from the priority of the organization which is represented in the
     allocation priority. The OEC must be ―E‖ (critical for operation), ―F‖ (impairs operation),
     or ―G‖ (not critical for operation). The default is ―G.‖ (Organizational essentiality code
     of ―M‖ does not apply to ALC-managed equipment items; it is for FMS-peculiar
     applications and can only be used with SEC 7 and EEC M.) Reference Table 13.12
     3.2.26.4. Computation of the MIEC. The MIEC will be weighted using individual
     authorizations and summarized first to actual NSN, then to the SGM level, and last to
     I&S master if an I&SG is applicable. The MIEC will be recomputed quarterly (initial
     cycle) with file maintenance following the initial cycle.
         3.2.26.4.1. MIEC is computed in D200C after authorization and asset data is received
         from its interface with D039. MIEC for each SGM (except I&S master) is the
         average of actual NSN MIEC priorities which have been weighted by total actual
         NSN authorized quantities. The MIEC for the I&S master is the average of the SGM
         MIEC priorities weighted by the total authorizations for each SGM.
         3.2.26.4.2. MDS, authorized quantity, and allocation priority are obtained by NSN
         from Peacetime Authorization, WRM Authorization, and Additive Requirement
         database tables for use in MIEC computations (forecast data is not included). If MDS
         is obtained from either Peacetime Authorization table or from Additive Requirement
         table and the MDS does not equal the program’s previous MDS, one or more of
         RMS’s three Application/Program/Indenture (API) database tables (Standard
         Designator, Standard Program Designator, and/or MIEC Priority) are accessed to
         compute the system essentiality code portion of MIEC.
         3.2.26.4.3. MIEC is updated in the Item Cycle database table by NSN and in the
         Computation Subgroup table by SGM and I&S master NSN.
  3.2.27. REPAIR CYCLE. This file maintainable field is an information entry which reflects
  the number of days required by maintenance to restore an item to serviceable condition.
  Repair cycle time reflects the number of days involved as the reparable item passes through
  all stages, from the time of its removal as unserviceable until it is restored to a serviceable
  condition.

   3.2.28. REPAIR LOCATION. An ―X‖ will appear in the following file maintainable fields
   (depot, field, contractor, other) to indicate all applicable categories of repair locations.
       3.2.28.1. DEP ERRC is ―S‖ and a depot is the technology repair center.
       3.2.28.2. FLD ERRC is ―S‖ or ―U‖ and limited field repair is possible.
       3.2.28.3. CON. Contract exists for contractor repair.
       3.2.28.4. OTH. AF repair capability has been established at locations other than a depot,
       base, or contractor site (i.e. other services).
   3.2.29. SUB-SYSTEM APPLICATION.          This file maintainable field identifies the
   application(s) (lower than the MDS) for which an item is required or which the NSN
   supports.
   3.2.30. ERRC. ERRC codes for centrally-procured equipment-type items are ―S‖ and ―U‖
   which means that these items are non-expendable, reparable items. ERRC code ―S‖
   corresponds to ERRC designator of ―ND2‖ which supports depot-level condemnation.
   ERRC code ―U‖ (with ERRC designator of ―NF2‖) permits intermediate-level
   condemnation. The first position of the ERRC designator identifies the expendability of the
   item (X = expendable, N = non-expendable); the second position identifies the highest
   authorized repair level (B = user, F = Field, D = depot).
   3.2.31. U/I. Unit of Issue is the physical measurement, the count, or when applicable, the
   container or shape of an item for purposes of requisitioning by, and issue to, the end user.
   The U/I is that element of catalog management data to which the unit price is ascribed. For
   equipment items, the predominant unit of issue is ―EA‖ (each). Reference AFMAN 23-110
   V1,         P4,          C1,         Attachment      1A-6         (at        http://www.e-
   publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/PUBS/AF/23/23011001/010401/010401.pdf) for a
   complete list of unit of issue codes.
   3.2.32. DIPEC IND. Defense Industrial Plant Equipment Center Indicator is a one position
   alphabetic character used to indicate items subject to DIPEC cognizance. Valid codes are
   ―Y‖ and ―N.‖ ―Y‖ coded NSNs are subject to DoD visibility and control by annual status
   reporting to the DIPEC; these items are not subject to procurement, disposal, or repair
   without prior DIPEC authorization.
3.3. IMCD Continued-RIAR Data by SGM. The MPPC report is updated through many of
the fields in this section. In addition, several of the fields will be periodically updated via
overlays from ERS, when the NSN’s funding and buy list quantities are managed within ERS.

     3.3.1. UNIT COST BUY. This element reflects the unit cost at the buy position. This cost
     will be reflected on the MPPC report. If the NSN is in ERS, this field will be periodically
     updated from ERS mass file maintenance actions.
     3.3.2. UNIT COST BUD. This element reflects the unit cost at the budget position. This
     cost will be reflected on the MPPC report. If the NSN is in ERS, this field will be
     periodically updated from ERS mass file maintenance actions.
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                    81


  3.3.3. UNIT COST BUD + 1. This element reflects the unit cost at the budget +1 position.
  Note: Budget+1refers to one year beyond the budget position. This cost will be reflected on
  the MPPC report. If the NSN is in ERS, this field will be periodically updated from ERS
  mass file maintenance actions.
  3.3.4. BUY ADJ NET RQMT QTY PRI-2. This element reflects the priority 2 adjusted net
  buy requirement quantity. This is the quantity which will not be funded in the buy year, but
  will be deferred until the following year; therefore, this quantity will become an addition to
  the budget-position requirement. Note: If the priority 2 adjusted net buy requirement
  quantity is zero, the system will treat all of the adjusted net buy requirement quantity as
  priority 1. This quantity will be reflected on the MPPC report. If the NSN is in ERS and the
  funded buy quantity is managed in ERS, this field will be mechanically updated from ERS in
  a mass file maintenance action after the initial buy list is finalized for the March Update
  Computation cycle. This field is only mechanically file maintained once during the March
  WS file maintenance window.
  3.3.5. BUD ADJ NET RQMT QTY PRI-2. This element reflects the priority 2 adjusted net
  budget requirement quantity. This is the quantity which will not be funded in the budget
  year, but will be deferred until the following year; therefore, this quantity will become an
  addition to the budget +1 requirement. Note: If the priority 2 adjusted net budget
  requirement quantity is zero, the system will consider all of the adjusted net budget
  requirement quantity as priority 1. This quantity will be reflected on the MPPC report. If the
  NSN is in ERS and the funded buy quantities is managed in ERS, this field will be
  mechanically updated from ERS in a mass file maintenance action after the initial buy list is
  finalized for the March Update Computation cycle. This field is only mechanically file
  maintained once during the March WS file maintenance window.
  3.3.6. BUD+1 ADJ NET RQMT PRI-2. This element reflects the priority 2 adjusted net
  budget +1 requirement quantity. This is the quantity which will not be funded in the budget
  +1 year, but will be deferred until the following year, therefore, the priority 2 adjusted net
  budget +1 requirement quantity will become an addition to the budget +2 requirement. Note:
  If this priority 2 quantity is zero (the system default), the RMS will consider the entire
  adjusted net budget +1 requirement as priority 1. This quantity will be reflected on the
  MPPC report. If the NSN is in ERS and the funded buy quantities is managed in ERS, this
  field will be mechanically updated from ERS in a mass file maintenance action after the
  initial buy list is finalized for the March Update Computation cycle. This field is only
  mechanically file maintained once during the March WS file maintenance window.
  3.3.7. AFR BUY QTY PRI-2. This element reflects the priority 2 AFR (MAJCOM code
  ―0M‖) adjusted net buy requirement quantity. This quantity will be reflected on the MPPC
  report.
  3.3.8. AFR BUD QTY PRI-2. Priority 2 AFR (MAJCOM code ―0M‖) adjusted net budget
  requirement quantity. This quantity will be reflected on the MPPC report.
  3.3.9. AFR BUD +1 QTY PRI-2. Priority 2 AFR (MAJCOM code ―0M‖) adjusted net
  budget +1 requirement quantity. This quantity will be reflected on the MPPC report.
  3.3.10. ANG BUY QTY PRI-2. Priority 2 ANG (MAJCOM code ―4Z‖) adjusted net buy
  requirement quantity. This quantity will be reflected on the MPPC report.

   3.3.11. ANG BUD QTY PRI-2. Priority 2 ANG (MAJCOM code ―4Z‖) adjusted net budget
   requirement quantity. This quantity will be reflected on the MPPC report.
   3.3.12. ANG BUD+1 QTY PRI-2. Priority 2 ANG (MAJCOM code ―4Z‖) adjusted net
   budget +1 requirement quantity. This quantity will be reflected on the MPPC report.
   3.3.13. COMP REPL FAC. This is the computation replacement factor which was used in
   the most recent equipment item requirements computation.
   3.3.14. IMS MPC. IMS Materiel Program code is a four-position alphanumeric field which
   is file maintained by the IMS to affect only the MPC on the MPPC report. If not file
   maintained, the IMS MPC will be the same as the last four positions of the Controlled
   Budget Code. The MPC is applicable to the Investment Budget Control Code. It provides a
   subdivision of the accounting classification below the BPAC level. It can be assigned to
   individual items by the BP’s funds manager.
   3.3.15. ACCEPTANCE CD. Acceptance code is an element which will be file maintained
   to affect the MPPC. Valid codes are ―A‖ (item accepted for AF use) and ―B‖ (items still
   under development; therefore, not yet accepted for AF use). This field will be reflected on
   the MPPC report.
   3.3.16. TERMINATION CD. Termination code is a file maintainable one-position
   alphabetic data element which indicates the reason for taking termination/reduction or non-
   termination action of funded/on-order assets. This termination code also appears on the IA
   product. A termination code must be entered for any item on the initial termination list. All
   items computing a termination quantity as a result of the initial, updated, or final computation
   cycles must have a termination code file maintained and must be included within the
   Quarterly Termination Report. For more information on the Quarterly Termination Report
   and specific termination codes, see Chapter 8 and Table 13.20
   3.3.17. CHG IND DTL. Change indicator Detail will have a value of ―Y‖ or blank
   depending on the file maintenance activity that has taken place in D200C for the designated
   processing cycle. A ―Y‖ indicates that file maintenance actions have been made to the
   IMCD, RAR, or I&S restructure.
   3.3.18. CHG IND RIAR. Change indicator RIAR will have a value of ―*‖ or blank
   depending on the file maintenance activity that has taken place in the system during the
   designated update cycle. An asterisk indicates that file maintenance actions have been made
   to WS or RRD and/or IMCD Section A Continued for the MPPC.
   3.3.19. COMP REPL CRIT CD. This is the replacement criteria code which was used in the
   most recent equipment item requirements computation.
   3.3.20. COMP SGM REPL FACTORS-SECTION E. These are the PULE replacement
   factors which were computed in the most recent equipment item requirements computation.
3.4. IMCD -By Actual Stock Number. This section contains cataloging and fuels data which
will be filed maintained by actual NSN. Fuels section data is to be manually input since no
mechanical source is available for the data. The following data elements represent the latest
cataloging data available from RMS D200E and are described below: PICA/Nonconsumable

  publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/PUBS/AF/23/23011006/060004/060004.pdf).
  3.4.7. PICA/NIMSC. The PICA code is a three-position alphanumeric code which identifies
  the location of the PICA and is used in the IMCD report. It is part of the PICA/NIMSC field.
  The PICA is synonymous with the source of supply. The PICA has authority to catalog,
  procure, dispose, depot repair, stock and distribute. For description of Source of Supply
  (SOS) codes, reference DoD 4100.39-M, V10, C4, Table 103 (located at
  http://www.dlis.dla.mil/PDFs/Procedures/vol10.pdf). NIMSC is a one-position alphabetic
  code which identifies the service performing depot maintenance for the PICA. Reference
  DoD         4100.39-M,         V10,        C4,       Table        107         (located    at
  http://www.dlis.dla.mil/PDFs/Procedures/vol10.pdf) for the applicable PICA/NIMSC
  codes and definitions.
  3.4.8. EFF DATE. Effective Date is the Julian date on which the NIMSC data is effective.
  3.4.9. EEC. Equipment Essentiality Code of the actual NSN. This file-maintainable EEC
  will be used each time a weighted MIEC is computed. Reference Table 13.6 for additional
  information and description of valid codes.
  3.4.10. MIEC. Mission Item Essentiality code assigned to the actual NSN is a file-
  maintainable three-position field (reference para 3.2.26). The MIEC is computed for the
  actual NSN.
  3.4.11. STD PRICE. Standard Price of the actual NSN is a file-maintainable field which is
  represented in whole dollars (no cents). Note: The standard price includes a three percent
  (3%) FDT cost. If the NSN is in ERS, the IMS no longer file maintains this field directly in
  D200C. Instead the Standard Price is calculated in ERS and then overlaid back to D200C
  (but this only applies to the NSNs in ERS).
  3.4.12. PRCUR DATE. Procurement Date is a Julian date in the format YYDDD which
  reflects either the J041 date of last purchase or the last date standard price was file
  maintained, whichever is most current. If the NSN is in ERS, the IMS no longer file
  maintains this field. It is now file maintained within ERS and fed back to D200C (but this
  only applies to the NSNs in ERS).
  3.4.13. PART 2 MISC DATA.
     3.4.13.1. ACTUAL STK NO. Actual Stock Number.
     3.4.13.2. SICA/NIMSC. This field lists SOS and type of support data for AF, Army,
     Marine, and/or Navy SICAs. This field consists of a three-position SOS code which
     identifies a SICA and its geographic location, followed by a one-position numeric
     NIMSC code which identifies the degree of support received by the SICA. For a listing
     of SOS codes, reference DoD 4100.39-M, V10, C4, Table 103; for a listing of SICA
     codes, reference Table 107(at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/PDFs/Procedures/vol10.pdf).

       3.4.13.4. FUELS SEC. Fuels Section data is not supplied by an external source, but is
       file maintainable by the user to provide the following data.
          3.4.13.4.1. CD. Fuels code is a one-position alphabetic code which indicates the type
          of ground fuel used for the corresponding actual NSN: diesel (D), gasoline (G), or
          jet (J). Reference AFMAN 23-110, V2, P2, C3, Table 3A1.59 (at http://www.e-
          publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/PUBS/AF/23/23011002/020203/020203.pdf
          ).
          3.4.13.4.2. RATE. Fuel rate is used in conjunction with fuel measure to indicate the
          rate at which fuel is consumed. Fuel rate is a four-position numeric field in the
          format 999.9.
          3.4.13.4.3. EAS. Fuel measure is an alphabetic code which indicates the manner in
          which fuel consumption is determined: gallons per hour (H), kilometers per liter (K),
          or miles per gallon (M).
3.5. IMCD . This section contains asset history data by actual NSN as well as summary data by
SGM NSN. Data for the current processing cycle will be loaded following the D039/AFEMS
interface which supplies data to D200C; therefore, IMCD Section C data will be loaded
concurrently with RAR data. If the RAR has not yet been loaded for the current processing

        ACQUIRED   is usually AFMC Form 318 card. IMS input only.


    3.5.1. ACT. Action code denotes the type of file maintenance action taken.
    3.5.2. ACTUAL STOCK NUMBER.
    3.5.3. TOTAL LOSSES. This data element represents the summation of the following asset
    loss quantities by actual NSN. SAP asset loss quantity; Non-reported (N/RPT) asset loss
    quantity; Installation (INSTL) asset loss quantity; Modification (MOD) asset loss quantity;
    Condemnation (CNDM) asset loss quantity; DRMO asset loss quantity; and, other asset loss
    quantity.
    3.5.4. TOTAL AVAL. Total available asset quantity is the summation of In-Service
    (INSVC) asset quantity, the warehouse Serviceable (SERV) without TOC asset quantity, and
    the warehouse Unserviceable (UNSERV) asset quantity.
    3.5.5. TOT ACQUIRED. Total acquired asset quantity equals the sum of total asset losses
    and total available assets. (This element does not include funded/on-order assets.)
    3.5.6. IMS TOTAL ACQUIRED. Inventory Management Specialist Total Acquired asset
    quantity is a file maintainable element. The IMS will review the asset procurement history to
    determine the number of assets the AF has procured and received. The IMS Total Acquired
    will reflect the same total quantity as the AF Form 318.
       3.5.6.1. The quantity will include all applicable assets brought into the inventory whether
       they were funded by the Prime IMS, a Program Office, a depot maintenance organization,
       or another organization. However, this does not include substitute assets which have
       been locally procured by using organizations to offset their requirements.
       3.5.6.2. Further, Funded/On Order assets will not be included; only assets for which the
       AF has taken possession. As assets are delivered and reported, the IMS will file maintain
       this field.
       3.5.6.3. The Asset Reconciliation process will compare the system TOTAL ACQUIRED
       to the IMS TOTAL ACQUIRED; significant variances require review and
       documentation. During the reconciliation process, the IMS may determine it is necessary
       to establish a baseline if historical procurement/disposition records are not available.
       Once a baseline has been established and documented, the quantity file maintained in the
       IMS TOTAL ACQUIRED will be the baseline plus any asset delivered since the
88                                                           AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011

  subgroup (RAR Section 7, Part 2), plus the number of assets lost by the I&S subgroup (RAR
  Section 7, Part 3), at the reported position. This field can only be file maintained through the
  RAR Sections 1, 3, and 4.
  3.5.15. SERV. This field represents the quantity of warehouse serviceable assets reported in
  RAR Section 2 minus the TOC warehouse serviceable assets. This field can only be file
  maintained in RAR Section 2.
  3.5.16. TOC. Technical Order Compliance assets are the quantity of assets requiring TOC
  modification as reported by base activities by actual NSN and ownership purpose and system
  designation (OPSD) of ―OD.‖ (TOC asset quantity detail information will be reviewed and
  file maintained in RAR Section 2.)
  3.5.17. UNSERV. This field is the total warehouse unserviceable assets as of the reported

    3.6.2. ACTUAL STK NO. Actual stock number.
    3.6.3. IN-USE ASSETS WITHOUT THE SPECIAL ALLOWANCE ASCS. This field
    reflects eight FY quarters of in-use asset data (beginning with the reported position). Note:
    In-use assets are not included when reported with special ASCs or with ―STBY‖ appearing in
    the last four positions of the allowance identification to designate standby levels. (Special
    ASCs follow: 000, 014, 044, 047, 048, 049, 050, 052, 053, 054, 055, 057, 064, 076, 985,
    986, and 987.)
    3.6.4. RATE. Condemnation rate is equal to zero if no assets have been condemned in the
    last eight quarters or if in-use history data is insufficient (for data sufficiency, there must be
    at least two quarters of in-use asset data with quantities of ten or more). Otherwise, the
    condemnation rate will be mechanically computed by dividing the total quarterly number of
    condemned assets by the total quarterly number of in-use assets; the result is multiplied by
    four. Note: In-use asset quantity does not include WRM assets or assets reported with
    special ASCs.
    3.6.5. CONDEMNATIONS. This field reflects eight quarters of condemnation data as
    reported from AFEMS to the RAR, Section 2 by SRAN, or added by IMS file maintenance.

   3.6.6. IM RT. IMS repair rate factor is a file-maintainable element which is used by the
   system to compute repair quantities if the repair criteria code is equal to ―I.‖ However, this
   field cannot be file maintained at this time. Repair requirement information must be file
   maintained in the ERR database or in ABCS. (The repair rate factor will not exceed 1.000.)
   The IMS must have documentation on the Notepad when the rate is manually input.
   3.6.7. CRI/CD. Repair criteria code is a file maintainable element which indicates which
   repair rate will be used in computing repair quantities. However, this element will not be file
   maintained at this time, as the repair data is passed from D039 to D075. The repair data in
   D200C is for information only. Repair requirement information must be file maintained in
   the ERR database or in ABCS. Reference Table 13.16 for the codes and descriptions.
   3.6.8. RATE. The repair rate factor is used when estimating the future amount of depot
   assets that need to be repaired. D039 computes the repair rate factor for each actual NSN
   quarterly. These factors are computed from the past history of reparable generations and in-
   use assets when repair criteria code of ―C‖ applies. This element will not be file maintained
   at this time; the repair data is passed from D039 to D075. The repair data in D200C is for
   information only. Repair requirement information must be file maintained in the ERR
   database or in ABCS.
       3.6.8.1. The following is an example of Repair Rate Factors when the Repair Criteria
       Code is ―I.‖

           3.6.8.1.1. Condemnation rate equals 0.0000 because insufficient in-use data is
           available.
           3.6.8.1.2. To determine significant quarter, begin with the oldest quarter and search
           reparable generation data for the first non-zero quantity. In this example, quarter 1/09
           contains one reparable generation. Then sum the number of reparable generations
           from this point to the remaining recent quarters. Sum the in-use asset data beginning
           with the same significant quarter. Divide the applicable reparable generation total by
           the applicable in-use asset total to arrive at the repair rate factor. (1+0)/(3+5) = 0.125
       3.6.8.2. The next example shows the Repair Rate Factors when the Repair Criteria Code
       is ―C.‖

   3.6.9. SEL. Repair selection code is used to determine whether repair requirement quantities
   will be computed. However, this factor will not be file maintained at this time as the repair
   data is passed from D039 to D075. The repair data in D200C is for information only. Repair
   requirement information must be file maintained in the ERR database or in ABCS.

  3.7.2. ACTUAL STK NO. Actual stock number.
  3.7.3. AGE GRP. Age group is a two-position numeric field which denotes the FY in which
  the item was purchased and/or was put into service. PULE data will be clustered by each age
  group for each actual NSN in ascending order. File maintenance edits prohibit the age group
  from exceeding the current year; these edits also prohibit the current year from exceeding the
  age group by more than 30 years. Note: The age group will be blank when data is provided
  for SGM NSN total.
  3.7.4. PROC QTY. Procurement quantity is the number of assets purchased/acquired for an

  3.7.5. ANN USE. Annual usage is the number of hours an item is expected to be used each
  year.
  3.7.6. LIFE EXP. Life expectancy is a two-position numeric field which represents the
  anticipated age, expressed in years, at which time the item will be retired from inventory due
  to declining performance and/or excessive repair costs. When file maintaining life
  expectancy, this value must be greater than zero; the system default is 10 years.
  3.7.7. LIFE MAX. Maximum life expectancy is a two-position numeric field which
  represents the estimated age, expressed in years, at which time the item must be replaced.
  System edits require that the maximum life expectancy be greater than the anticipated life
  expectancy. The system default for maximum life expectancy is 15 years.
  3.7.8. PROB CNDM. Probability of condemnation is the estimated percentage (expressed as
  a decimal) of items which are expected to be condemned at the mandatory replacement age.
  A probability of 0.95 indicates that 95 percent of the items are expected to be condemned
  before reaching the mandatory replacement age; this means that five percent or fewer items
  are expected to survive to the mandatory replacement age. System edits require that the
  probability of condemnation exceed 0.79, but must be less than or equal to 1.00. The system
  default is 0.95.
  3.7.9. PROJ YR. Projection by FY identifies nine points in time through which PULE
  replacement requirements are projected, beginning with the current appropriation FY and
  extending 18 years beyond the current appropriation FY. The following FYs will be used in
  the projection; current appropriation FY, second through sixth FYs, ninth, fourteenth, and
  nineteenth FY.
  3.7.10. REPL QTY. Replacement quantity is computed by PULE logic to equal the number
  of assets which will require replacement during the applicable appropriation FY.
  3.7.11. SGM REPL FACTOR. SGM replacement factor is the percentage of authorized
  assets that will need replacement as a result of anticipated condemnations. These factors are
  derived by dividing the total replacement quantity by the total procurement quantity for each
  appropriation FY.

                               INPUT SYSTEM INTERFACE

4.1. Purpose. The interfaces between the Classified Equipment Requirements Computation
(CERC - D039) and supporting input systems are discussed in this chapter. This chapter gives a
general outline of data obtained from interfacing systems, but does not repeat the technical
details pertaining to these interfacing systems; however, it informs the reader where more
information on the input systems can be obtained. D039 is generated by a collection of data as
identified by various information sources. These sources include force structure plans, SERD,
contractor information, SM’s input and interfacing data systems identified in para 4.3. A data
flow chart for C001, D039, and D200C is at Figure 2.2.
4.2. Selection of Items. The D043, used by both AFEMS and the RMS, is the basis for the
mechanical selection of items to be computed in the D039 system. For purposes of requirements
and asset data systems interface, it will be noted that NSNs appearing in the SNCR, created in
D200C (and displayed in IMCD Section B), are the only ones used for computing requirements,
except for satisfactory substitute assets reported to AFEMS and explained further in para 4.4
These NSNs are matched against all requirements and asset data from input systems. All data
from input systems which match the SNCR stock numbers are entered into the requirements
computation system; all data which does not match is not used and will not appear on exception
or error listings. Therefore, the SNCR must contain a valid listing of all items for which the IMS
wants to have requirements computed.
4.3. AFEMS Records. AFEMS (C001) serves as a primary data source for the equipment
requirements computation system. The C001 system edits data received on a daily basis,
maintains master control files through daily transaction reporting, and passes data to the D039 on
a quarterly basis. Besides the data accumulated from the Standard Base Supply System (SBSS/
D002A), the C001 will provide asset and requirement data received from D034A, D035A,
D035B, D035K, D035T, J041 and K002. AFEMS current data can be accessed via screens
described in the AFEMS Users’ Manual (reference AFMAN 23-110, V4, P2).
   4.3.1. The following data systems will interface with C001 which will then reformat the data
   and pass to D039, and then pass applicable data to D200C.
       4.3.1.1. D002A/USAF Standard Base Supply System (SBSS). The D002A standardizes
       base equipment accounts throughout the AF. Bases input their current authorizations and
       on-hand asset data to D002A and transaction reports are sent to C001 daily. This data
       will be displayed in the RAR Sections 1 or 2, and AFEMS AAVC and/or AAVC (Y)
       screens.
       4.3.1.2. D034A/Special Support Stock Control and Distribution System (SS SC&D).
       The SS SC&D/D034A provides a uniform system management capability for WW
       property accounting, inventory control, and distribution or redistribution of materiel. The
       SS SC&D, through standardization of distribution type decisions, provides rapid and
       positive response to customer demands through applying the principles of management
       by exception. Non-AFMC interfacing activities are Army Materiel Command, Overhaul
       and Production contracts. The D034A passes data for items in the AF inventory usually,
       but not limited to, non-expendable equipment items, ERRC of ―S‖ or‖ U.‖ Tracking of
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                     97


     support equipment will be provided through in transit controls and reporting of assets by
     location, Military Standard Transaction Report and Accounting Procedures (MILSTRAP)
     purpose, and condition. The type of information provided by D034A includes quantity of
     assets due-in, warehouse balances by condition, shipments or transfers by conditions,
     receipts from procurement and other than procurement (e.g. receipts from other services),
     issues, inventory adjustments, and changes in an asset’s condition or ownership code.
     4.3.1.3. D035A/Item Manager Wholesale Requisition Process. The D035A provides
     immediate stock control decision making regarding customer requisitions, optimal
     distribution or redistribution of stocks, and immediate local asset visibility to the IMS at
     each ALC. The D035 passes (quantity of assets due-in, warehouse asset balances by
     condition, shipments or transfers by condition, receipts from procurement and other than
     procurement, issues, inventory adjustments and changes in an asset condition by
     ownership code). This information is furnished for depot accounts for shipping and
     receiving of warehouse assets. Data elements include: SGM NSN; ALC routing
     identifier; serviceable asset balances; unserviceable asset balances; in transit asset
     balances; and condemnation losses quantity. This data will be displayed in RAR Section
     2, and AFEMS AVVC(Y) and AWAD screens.
     4.3.1.4. D035B/Wholesale Management and Efficiency Reports. The D035B provides
     transaction history data and management data products for AF managed materiel. It
     measures the AFMC requisitioning pipeline, by segment, against DoD time standards
     from date of requisition to date materiel is available for shipment. The D035B passes
     backorder information from each of the ALCs that contains all NSNs with status codes
     BV and BB, and a document identifier code beginning with an ―A,‖ an ERRC of ―S‖ or
     ―U,‖ and procurement source code (PSC) of ―5.‖ This data is displayed in RAR Section
     4, for TRCs 16 and 65.
     4.3.1.5. D035K/Wholesale and Retail Receiving and Shipping. The Wholesale and
     Retail Receiving and Shipping System (D035K) maintain historical data for all
     accountable retail transactions and others. It is an excellent source of information for the
     determination of supply decisions. D035K passes retail asset transactions for equipment
     items, ERRC S or U, with EMCs of 3, 4, or 5. These transactions and their utilization are
     defined      in    AFMAN         23-110,      V3,      P2,     C2     (at     http://www.e-
     publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/PUBS/AF/23/23011003/030202/030202.pdf).
     This file contains excess balance adjustments, transfers to disposal, receipts, turn-ins,
     interconditional transfers, and inventory adjustments. This file also contains quantity of
     assets redistributed to other stock record accounts, receipts from procurement and other
     procurement issues, inventory adjustments and warehouse balances by condition.
     4.3.1.6. D035T/Shipping Information System. The D035T produces documentation of
     actual movement of property for shipment through surface terminals. It produces status
     receipts in materiel receiving or surface terminals and provides receipt data for retail and
     wholesale contract items. The D035T passes DODAAD data which will be used to
     establish, validate and or modify AFEMS master address information.
     4.3.1.7. J041/Acquisition and Due-In System. The J041 maintains data relative to the
     acquisition of materiel and services for and/or by HQ AFMC. Although primarily
     oriented to acquisitions via contracting, it also maintains records of materiel being
98                                                          AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011


     acquired via reclamation projects, contract termination inventory, other services long
     supply assets, and SAP excesses. J041 specifically excludes classified contracts and base
     procurement (local purchases). The J041 passes due-in asset information, including
     shipments and data pertaining to Purchase Requests/Military Interdepartmental Purchase
     Requests (PR/MIPRs). This data will be displayed in RAR Section 2, and AFEMS
     ABDS, ADES, ADIS and ASOC screens.
     4.3.1.8. K002/USAF Programming Document - Force Structure Plan. The K002 is
     developed by HQ USAF with the composition of the AF in terms of combat readiness
     capability. The force structure is based on organizational requirements by weapon
     systems as they are placed within the MAJCOMs. The current and future organizational
     plans are used by the MAJCOMs in determining the equipment requirements for peace
     and wartime needs. This information is used to project and place necessary equipment
     supporting assigned missions as activations and deactivations take place.
     4.3.1.9. MAJCOM Automated Fleet Information System (MAFIS). MAFIS is a PC-
     driven database which provides C001 with vehicle authorization data.
  4.3.2. Authorization and Asset Master (MOA C001/D039-C). This consists of the SBSS
  current authorization and asset data and WRM authorization and asset data, plus the forecast
  requirements input by the MAJCOMs.
     4.3.2.1. Peacetime (current) authorizations and in-use assets (RAR Section 1). This data
     includes vehicle and non-vehicle authorizations and preferred in-use assets (system of
     origin: D002A).
     4.3.2.2. Peacetime (current) substitute in-use assets, non-vehicular (RAR Section 1).
     4.3.2.3. Peacetime (current) substitute in-use assets, vehicles (RAR Section 1). The
     registration number is provided in lieu of the in-place quantity.
     4.3.2.4. WRM authorizations and in-place assets (RAR Section 3). This data includes
     vehicle and non-vehicle authorizations and preferred in-place assets.
     4.3.2.5. WRM substitute in-place assets – non-vehicular (RAR Section 3).
     4.3.2.6. WRM substitute in-place assets – vehicles (RAR Section 1). The registration
     number is provided in lieu of the in-place quantity.
  4.3.2.7. Forecast Requirements (RAR Section 1). The forecast data provides a record of all
  future programmed organizations (activation, deactivation, moves, transfers, reorganizations,
  and re-designation), wartime additive missions plus deactivating organizations up to 90 days
  following deactivation when equipment is still on-hand. The programmed organization
  forecast data contains not only those organizations which are enumerated within the USAF
  programming document (PD), but also those organizations designated as command created.
  (Within this category, AETC is provided with a method of reporting their training courses.)
  Forecast data provides the commands, as well as the IMS at the various ALCs, with the
  method of forecasting equipment requirements upon acquisition of a new weapons system or
  to provide for more equipment when the quantity of a presently assigned weapon system is
  increased (i.e., 18 to 24). Conversely, forecast data provides a method whereby equipment
  requirements are to be reduced due to a loss of weapon system or a reduction in quantity of
  the presently assigned weapon system (i.e., 24 to 18). The increase or decrease of equipment
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                    99


   requirements may be accomplished through the use of forecast data. This data is applicable
   to a single item of equipment reflected by a need date and these records are also transmitted
   and visible through the authorization records submitted to the C001 system. The detail
   forecast and phased in being requirements will be viewed on AFEMS Screen RTPD.
   4.3.3. Valid Organization File (MOA C001/D039-A). This file contains a list of valid
   organization and WRM identifications along with MDS End Item Identification (EII)
   including the Area Code, Allocation Priority and PAC for each.

4.4. AFEMS Record Selection. AFEMS (C001) will provide D039 system with all records
applicable to non-expendable centrally procured (CP) NSNs (i.e., items with PSC-5). If a record,
either authorized or in-use substitute, is PSC-5, all related authorization and substitute records
are also included in the data furnished. After the records are received from AFEMS, D039 will
match the NSNs on the SNCR and include matching records in the appropriate computation
groups. This match occurs on the authorized and substitute NSN field. All records obtained
from the C001 system that do not match either the authorized or substitute NSNs are not
included in the requirements computation.

4.6. Vehicle Input Data. AFEMS provides a quarterly input to D039 of vehicle authorization
and asset records. Vehicles are included in the overall AFEMS program, but due to the more
stringent requirement for registration number control, they are subject to other management
considerations within the REMS. Through input to AFEMS, REMS is responsible for
maintaining AF management control over registered vehicular items. C001 forwards these
processed records to D039 for inclusion with other items of SE in the quarterly WW
requirements computation.
   4.6.1. The type of vehicle reports submitted through the AFEMS conforms in general with
   other items of SE. Authorizations are submitted in standard authorization in-use in-place
   records for EAID forecast data requirements. However, all vehicle on-hand assets are
   submitted showing the registration number of the vehicle instead of quantity within the in-
   use in-place field. Detailed data elements obtained from AFEMS include: vehicle
   registration number, vehicle replacement code, and vehicle status code.
   4.6.2. Documentation sources are: AFMAN 23-110, V3, P4; AFMAN 23-110, V4, P1; and
   AFI         24-301,         Vehicle      Operations       (at      http://www.e-
   publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFI24-301.pdf).
4.7. Master Item Identification Control System (D043). This interface is the source of
nomenclature and military specification number input to the IMCD. The elements of data are:
current NSN; manufacturer’s Part Number (PN); manufacturer’s code; nomenclature; I&S
master NSN; subgroup NSN; OOU; JTC; and ALC code.
4.8. CSAG-M/DMAPS. Quarterly interface with D200C is designed to provide information on
expected requirements for depot maintenance equipment. It originates in DMAPS. If data is
there, these data elements are displayed in RAR, Section 5: DMAPS Analysis Number; NSN;
requesting ALC code; Estimated Delivery Date (EDD); and proposed quantity.

                          REQUIREMENTS AND ASSET DATA

5.1. Overview. This product displays the detailed authorization and asset data received from
AFEMS. Figures 5.1. through 5.12. show numbered screen prints of RAR Sections. Tables 5.1.
through 5.12. describe the screens in sequence.
   5.1.1. Purpose. The RAR screens in the RMS are designed to provide the IMS with a
   complete picture of all reported assets and requirements used in the computation of net
   requirements as of the end of each FY quarter. The display screens provide the IMS with the
   capability of reviewing the reported data and the file maintenance screens provide the IMS
   with the capability of updating the reported data as appropriate.
   5.1.2. Frequency. The RAR is produced with ―as of‖ dates: 31 December (cycle 1), 31
   March (cycle 4), 31 March update (cycle 4U), 30 June (cycle 7), 30 September (cycle 10)
   and 30 September update (cycle 10U). Only cycles 4 and 10 permit IMS file maintenance,
   after file maintained data is recomputed, the updated RAR will indicate cycle 4U or 10U as
   appropriate.
   5.1.3. Source of Data. The data appearing on the RAR is collected in the AFEMS and
   reported quarterly to the D039 system. This data consists of peacetime requirements and in-
   use assets, WRM requirements and in-place assets, forecast data and warehouse assets as
   reported through the SBSS/D002A and D035A/D034 systems. The information is reported
   by SRAN, a number or code assigned to identify bases. The D039, upon acceptance of data
   from the AFEMS, phases the requirements and assets, develops net requirements and passes
   the computation master files to the RMS/D200 system. The RMS provides the vehicle
   required for file maintenance actions. The source data for Section 5 of the RAR, CSAG-M,
   is the DMAPS; however, the specific data element fields are no longer being maintained in
   DMAPS.
   5.1.4. Content. The RAR consists of nine sections of which only the first four are file
   maintainable by the IMS. If no data exists for any section, the message ―List Is Empty‖ will
   appear when the section is accessed. Sections 1 and 3 have two different versions: non-
   vehicular equipment and vehicular equipment. The NSN entered into the system will cause
   the appropriate section 1 or 3 screen to appear. The RAR may be viewed from a previous
   cycle if an alternate cycle date is selected while in the display option. This is necessary for
   comparison of data reported on the current versus previous cycles. The file maintainable
   sections are:

          5.3.2.1. The SRAN is printed as information to the IMS. All peacetime authorizations
          and asset data reported with the SRAN are listed under the applicable SRAN. Some
          pseudo SRANs are found in Section 1 as follows:
               5.3.2.1.1. 7777 or XXX7 for non- EAID, classified, overseas activities;
               5.3.2.1.2. 8888 or XXX8 for non- EAID, classified, zone of interior activities; and
               5.3.2.1.3. 8999 for activities which cannot be identified.
          5.3.2.2. The base name (LOC), for which requirements and asset data were reported, is
          shown to help the IMS in reviewing the RAR. The base name is obtained from AFEMS
          and is developed from the SRAN responsible for reporting the requirements or assets.
          All data which can be identified to a SRAN will be listed under a base name.
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                     107


     5.3.2.3. The geographical location (AREA) of the reporting activity will be shown as a
     single digit code. Reference Table 13.4 for the codes and definitions.
     5.3.2.4. The function (FUNC) code field will appear at the beginning of each line shown
     for the reporting activity on the File Maintenance screens. There is no FUNC in the
     display screens or the output product; however, there is an ACT field in the display
     screens and output product. ACT is explained in Chapter 3, IMCD and codes and
     definitions are in Table 13.1 A system generated ―V‖ will appear if a line contains data.
     Lines that have no data will show a system generated ―A‖ as the function code and will
     be used by the IMS if an add transaction is appropriate.
        5.3.2.4.1. The IMS will use the FUNC field, if appropriate, to indicate what type of
        action is being initiated for the line of data. Table 13.8 reflects the function codes
        that will be used by the IMS.
        5.3.2.4.2. If function code ―D‖ is mechanically assigned to a line of data, it is a signal
        to the IMS that the record reported by the AFEMS was not used in computing.
        Generally an unidentified or unmatched condition will cause this to occur.
     5.3.2.5. The (Asset NSN) field will show the NSN of both the authorized and in-use
     assets. If they are the same NSN and equal to the SGM this condition will be shown on a
     single line of data. If the in-use assets are not the SGM, then the following will appear:
        5.3.2.5.1. The first line will contain the authorized NSN with a ―P‖ printed in the
        Item Code (IC) field.
        5.3.2.5.2. The next line, or lines if more than one substitute NSN is involved, will
        contain the NSN of the asset(s) and either an ―S,‖ ―U‖ or ―M‖ will appear in the IC
        field. Reference AFMAN 23-110, V2, P2, C3, Table 3A1.31. for a list of ICs (at
        http://www.e-
        publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/PUBS/AF/23/23011002/020203/020203.pdf
        ).
     5.3.2.6. A single position, non-file maintainable record flag (RF) is provided to call
     attention to significant data conditions. Table 13.15 reflects the codes that may appear in
     this field.
     5.3.2.7. The organization (ORG) field provides detailed information about the activity
     for which requirements and assets have been reported through the AFEMS. It is a twelve
     position field which breaks down into the following components:
        5.3.2.7.1. A four position alpha-numeric organization number that identifies the unit
        at the reporting activity. An in-being unit, or one programmed to be in being within
        nine months, will have an actual organization number. AF named and unnumbered
        organizations will either reflect zeros or a base location code.
        5.3.2.7.2. Unit Kind Code (3 positions) designates the type of organization/unit (i.e.,
        134 Tactical Air Refueling Unit). Unit Kind Codes are listed on the Air Force
        Support Equipment Allowance Standard Community of Practice (CoP) at:
        https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID=MC-

         5.3.2.7.3. A one position numeric level code which identifies the reporting
         organization structure. Level codes are listed in AFMAN 23-110, V4, P1, C8, para
         8.2.1.3                  (located                  at             http://www.e-
         publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/PUBS/AF/23/23011004/040108/040108.pdf
         .
         5.3.2.7.4. A four position alpha-numeric field which indicates the separation of a unit
         from its home organization (i.e., detachment number).
      5.3.2.8. The allowance identification (ALLOW) is a seven position alpha-numeric field
      which identifies the allowance source for the authorized quantity appearing in the AUTH
      (authorization) field.
         5.3.2.8.1. The allowance standard number is indicated in the first three positions. In
         some instances, an ASC (e.g., 000A, 048, 054) instead of an AS number will appear.
         Allowance source codes will only be three or four positions. Refer to the AF Support
         Equipment          Allowance        Standards         (CoP)          (located       at
         https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID=MC-
         LG-01-24-6&Filter=MC-LG-01-24) for a directory of active AS’s, their Manager,
         Support Area and functional area.
         5.3.2.8.2. The fourth position will indicate the part of the allowance standard used to
         establish the reported authorization.
         5.3.2.8.3. The fifth position will indicate the section used to establish the reported
         authorization.
         5.3.2.8.4. The sixth position will indicate the subsection, if applicable, used to
         establish the reported authorization. If subsections are not applicable, this field will be
         zero filled.
         5.3.2.8.5. The seventh position will indicate the column used to establish the reported
         authorization.
      5.3.2.9. Authorized (AUTH) is a four digit numeric field showing the quantity the using
      activity reported as gross authorizations with the following exceptions:
         5.3.2.9.1. When it has been necessary to correct mechanically an authorized quantity,
         the revised quantity appears on the first line and the reported quantity immediately
         beneath it. An example is Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF) requirements
         reported which show a requirement greater than the reported in-use quantity. The
         authorization is reduced to equal the in-use assets in this case so as not to create a net
         AF funded buy. The shortage would be funded by the CSAG-M).
         5.3.2.9.2. If the ASC 048 (retention authority) appears in the ALLOW field, the in-
         use assets are left in section 1 and the authorized quantity is reduced to zero. The
         requirement will be mechanically added to section 4 as an additive requirement.
         Initially, if necessary, the authorized quantity is reduced to equal the in-use assets.
         During the update cycle, the IMS cannot change the reported data in section 1;
         however, section 4 can be changed. The requirement is not included in WW total
         requirements.
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                      109


        5.3.2.9.3. If ASC 000A (awaiting authorization approval), 044 (gift item), 050 (loan
        from other government agencies), 052 (stock level), or STBY (standby) appears in the
        ALLOW field, the reported authorization, if necessary, is reduced to equal the asset
        position. However, on update, no mechanical check for equalization of requirements
        to assets is made.
        5.3.2.9.4. If the reported authorized field contains alphabetic characters and the
        record is for a non-vehicle asset, the field is zeroed.
        5.3.2.9.5. If ASC 987 (temporary authorization) appears in the ALLOW field, the
        authorized quantity is reduced to zero at the cutoff date.
        5.3.2.9.6. If ASC 000 appears in the ALLOW field, the authorized quantity, if any, is
        overlaid with zeros.
        5.3.2.9.7. When the time-phased forecast data field contains entries other than zero,
        the authorized quantity is a forecast requirement to be effective in the quarter and FY
        indicated in the forecast data field. The quantity authorized in the forecast record will
        overlay the existing authorized quantity on the forecast date.
     5.3.2.10. The in-use (INUSE) field is a four digit numeric which indicates the number of
     assets that have been issued to custodians at the reporting activity. If alphabetic
     characters are reported, the field will be zeroed. If a line of data is a time-phased forecast
     record, the in-use will always be zero.
     5.3.2.11. Forecast data is used to show the date for which the gross requirements in the
     authorized field are to become effective. It is a three position numeric field which breaks
     down into two parts as follows:
        5.3.2.11.1. First position: This position will be 1, 2, 3, or 4 to indicate the quarter of
        the future need.
        5.3.2.11.2. Second and third positions: These positions will indicate the FY of the
        future need.
        5.3.2.11.3. If the forecast data is being used to change an existing authorization, the
        quantity in the authorized field of the forecast record will overlay (not add or
        subtract) the existing quantity on the forecast date. After overlay, this new quantity is
        projected throughout the remainder of the computation time frame unless a new
        forecast record is encountered to increase or decrease the quantity.
        5.3.2.11.4. The in-use field will always be blank on a forecast line.
     5.3.2.12. The IC is a single alpha code submitted by the using activity as to the
     desirability of in-use assets. This code is an expression of opinion and may (or may not)
     agree with the official I&S grouping. For more information, reference AFMAN 23-110,
     V2,          P2,        C3,         Table         3A1.31.         (at      http://www.e-
     publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/PUBS/AF/23/23011002/020203/020203.pdf).
     5.3.2.13. The multiple component indicator code (MI) indicates by the use of a ―Y‖ (yes)
     if the record is for the originally authorized quantity and is used for PACs ―I,‖ ―D,‖ or
     ―A.‖ An ―N‖ (no) indicates the authorized quantity was not originally reported, but has
     been mechanically generated or the reported NSN is unmatched to the NSN cross

       reference. In either situation, the NSN will not be used for PAC ―D,‖ ―I,‖ or ―A,‖ but
       only for a PAC of ―B‖ or ―R.‖
       5.3.2.14. The use code (UC) is a single position alpha code which indicates the type of
       record, type requirement, and source of the record. The use codes and definitions are
       listed in Table 5.2
       5.3.2.15. The MAJCOM code (MC) is a two position alpha-numeric code which

       5.3.4.6. The function (FUNC) codes are the same as discussed in para 5.3.2.4.
       5.3.4.7. The ASSET STOCK NO will contain the actual NSN for which summary data is
       being depicted. Only those NSNs shown in Section B, IMCD, will be included in this
       section. This is a file maintainable field.
       5.3.4.8. The Ownership/Purpose Account (ACCT) is a two position, file maintainable
       field which identifies the ownership account for which assets are being reported. The
114                                                          AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011


      code will be either 0A (AF assets other than supply condition code ―D‖) or 0D (TOC,
      SCC ―D,‖ assets). The RMS default value is ―0A.‖
      5.3.4.9. Due-in assets (DIA) is a file maintainable, six position numeric field which
      indicates the number of assets scheduled for direct shipment to the SRAN from contract.
      For non-depot activities, the number of assets is equal to the quantity with BV status in
      the D035A, Item Manager Wholesale Requisition Process (IMWRP). For depot
      activities, the number of assets is equal to that quantity destined for stock.
      5.3.4.10. The funded quantity (FUNDED) indicates the quantity of assets for which prior
      year funds have been received, but for which procurement has not been initiated, or
      where procurement action has been initiated but the due-ins have not yet been picked up
      mechanically. This field is always maintained manually by the IMS and will be updated
      on the 31 March and 30 September cycles. Failure to include this quantity can lead to
      false requirements. This field applies to ALCs only.
      5.3.4.11. SERV is a file maintainable, six position numeric field which indicates the
      serviceable warehouse assets reported by bases or assets resident at a storage distribution
      point (usually an ALC). These assets are shown by NSN and ownership account.
      Condition ―D‖ assets (TOC) are considered serviceable and will appear under this
      heading; however, these assets show ownership account 0D instead of 0A. TOC
      quantities are considered part of the total warehouse serviceable quantity.
      5.3.4.12. UNSERV is a file maintainable, six position numeric field which indicates the
      unserviceable warehouse assets, or those reparables on work order, reported by bases or
      assets resident at a storage distribution point (usually an ALC). These assets are shown
      by NSN and ownership account.
      5.3.4.13. The in transit (INTNS) field is a file maintainable, six position numeric field
      which indicates the quantity of assets enroute to the applicable SRAN. Assets enroute
      from new acquisition are excluded from the in transit quantity as they are considered
      DIA. The IMS will closely review any quantities showing as in transit to ensure they are
      valid. In transits apply to both base and ALC accounts.
      5.3.4.14. The asset total (TOTAL) is not a file maintainable field. Any entry is a
      computer generated sum of DIA + FUNDED + SERV + UNSERV + INTNS.
      5.3.4.15. The condemnation quantity (CNDM) is a file maintainable, four position
      numeric field which indicates the number of assets, by NSN and ownership account, that
      were condemned during the quarter ending with the computation cutoff date. While these
      assets are processed to a DRMO, they are tracked separately for two purposes. First, all
      condemnations are recorded in Section C, IMCD for the purpose of asset accounting and
      secondly in Section D, IMCD for the purpose of computing a condemnation rate
      (replacement factor).
      5.3.4.16. The DRMO quantity is a file maintainable, four position numeric field which
      indicates the number of assets processed to disposal during the quarter ending with the
      computation cutoff date. As indicated in the para 5.3.4.15., this quantity does not include
      those assets that were condemned. Entries in this field are added to Section C, IMCD to
      assist in asset accounting.

      physical location of in-place assets using a classified WRM Base Code Table maintained
      in AFEMS. This code cannot be changed.
      5.3.5.4. The composition code (COMP CODE) is a four position field which identifies
      the mission and function for the reported requirements and assets. This code cannot be
      changed. For add transactions, the MAJCOM, COMP CODE, BASE CODE and MDS
      must match the valid WRM table.
      5.3.5.5. In-place (I/P) asset quantity is a four position field which indicates the number
      of assets prepositioned or set aside in advance to support WRM requirements.
      5.3.5.6. The MC is the storing command responsible for reporting in-place assets. It is a
      two position code as used in Section 1.

             5.3.7.3.1.1. Contractor (EY or EZ) shipments (other than bailment). If shipment
             occurs prior to the computation cutoff date, the quantity shipped will appear as
             AST QTY and a like quantity will be shown in the AUTH QTY field. These
             requirements and/or assets will be valid for the entire computation period unless
             IMS adjusted. The TRC will equal 66.
             5.3.7.3.1.2. Contractor (EY or EZ) backorders (other than bailment). If shipment
             does not occur prior to the computation cutoff date, the quantity on backorder is
             shown in the AUTH QTY field and the AST QTY field will be zero. The TRC
             will be 65.
             5.3.7.3.1.3. Contractor (EY or EZ) partial shipments (other than bailment). In the
             event of partial shipments prior to the computation cutoff date, the requisition
             quantity will show in the AUTH QTY field and the shipped quantity will show in
             the AST QTY field.
             5.3.7.3.1.4. If the first two positions of the SRAN are FF (non-reporting activity),
             a TRC 16 additive is created.
         5.3.7.3.2. Bailment/loan shipments to contractors are tracked in the D035 system
         must be file maintained in D200C for the quarterly computations. The D035A on-
         loan will be inserted in the AUTH QTY. The TRC will be 69. Line 2 displays
         contract number, return date, and managing SRAN.
         5.3.7.3.3. AME, AF Form 538 (non-reported losses), and RPIE balances are created
         from records received from the AFEMS each computation cycle except update.
         Additive requirements are created to offset the reported assets. The TRC will be 90
         for AME, 91 for AF Form 538, and 92 for RPIE.
         5.3.7.3.4. Records received showing ASC 048 and an authorized quantity greater
         than zero are used to build two records. The first record remains in Section 1 with
         zero authorized and the reported assets as in use. The second record, an additive
         requirement equal to the in-use assets reported, is created in section 4. The TRC will
         be 34 if the assets have a parts preference code of 3 or 9. Otherwise, the additive will
         have a TRC of 33.
      5.3.7.4. This section can be used by the IMS to manually input any requirement and/or
      asset not otherwise included in the computation.
      5.3.7.5. The following elements are found in Section 4:
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                     119


           5.3.7.5.1. ASSET STOCK NUMBER is the NSN for the additive requirement and/or
           asset.
           5.3.7.5.2. ADDITIVE ID is the identification of the additive. This entry can be
           mechanical or manual.
              5.3.7.5.2.1. Mechanical entries will be:
                  5.3.7.5.2.1.1. Requisition numbers for contractor or non-reporting activity
                  backorders;
5.3.7.5.2.1.2. Requisition numbers for contractor shipments;
                  5.3.7.5.2.1.3. Contract numbers for bailment assets;
                  5.3.7.5.2.1.4. AF command for vehicle peacetime requirements at buy and
                  budget positions; and

                  budget positions.
              5.3.7.5.2.2. The IMS will identify manually input additives with any descriptive
              data desired as long as the data is not classified or does not compromise classified
              data.
           5.3.7.5.3. TYP RQT is the TRC which is a two position numeric code identifying the
           input to a specific type of requirement. The IMS will use the TRC which will most
           closely identify any manually input additive. TRCs 01-49 are excluded from the
           computation of replacement requirements. Thus, it is important to use the appropriate
           code. TRCs are covered in para 2.11.5.. These codes are available on RMS display
           screen TRT.
           5.3.7.5.4. AP is a one position numeric 1-5 which shows the Allocation Priority code
           or Force Activity Designator (FAD) for the additive requirement. This code is used
           during the allocation procedures for dividing available assets among known
           requirements.
           5.3.7.5.5. The area code (AR) is defined in Table 13.4.
           5.3.7.5.6. The transaction date (TRAN DATE) is a seven position numeric
           (CCYYDDD) which indicates the date the additive requirement was added to Section
           4. This date is used to force IMS review of additives as they become one year old to
           ensure their continued validity. Additives, which will be more than one year old by 31
           Mar or 30 Sep, are identified and output on the RMS product Over Age Additives for
           IMS review. All additives over one year will be purged from the system.
           5.3.7.5.7. AUTH QTY is a five position numeric which shows the additive
           requirement quantity.
           5.3.7.5.8. AST QTY is a five position numeric which shows the additive asset
           quantity. This field will be zero if the additive is a time-phased forecast.
           5.3.7.5.9. Forecast data is discussed in para 5.3.2.11.
           5.3.7.5.10. MC is defined in para 5.3.2.15.

      5.3.8.2. The source of this data is the DMAPS system which inputs requirements to the
      D039 each March quarterly and update cycle. However, the DMAPS is not being
      maintained, so no data is being received during the interface.
      5.3.8.3. The CSAG-M requirements are funded by the Capitol Purchases Program, 6E
      funds (CSAG-M), DBOF 97X 4930.FA20. The IMS will receive a fund site to purchase
      CSAG-M requirements.

   5.3.16. Section 9 Asset Reduction Records.
       5.3.16.1. This RMS screen shows all asset records that were released from active
       requirements due to unsuitability considerations. These records consist of unidentified
       assets not required by the reporting user, I&S parts preference code 4 or 9 assets, and
       unused vehicle replacement eligible assets. The computation will examine all in-use and
       in-place asset records for an expression of satisfaction as indicated by an ―S‖ in the IC
       field in Sections 1 or 3. If the in-use or in-place asset is not an equipment type item
       (NSN is not listed in Section B, IMCD), the asset is considered a suitable substitute for
       the using organization as long as that organization is in existence. However, when the
       organization phases out, the asset is also phased out or dropped from the computation as
       an authorization will no longer exist within the computing system for a non-equipment
       type item.
       5.3.16.2. The Section 9 screen is a combination of Sections 1 and 3 formats. The data

5.4. General Description of Over-Age Additive (OAA) Requirements Report.
   5.4.1. This hard copy report is produced on a semiannual basis for delivery to the IMS. The
   intent of the product is to identify those additive requirements in Section 4 of RAR which
   are, or will be, more than one year old on the next March or September computation cycle.
   5.4.2. The hard copy report generated in March identifies those additives which expire on 31
   March. The report generated in September identifies those additives which expire on 30
   September.
   5.4.3. As of 31 March and 30 September, all additives will be purged from the system.
   5.4.4. The IMS must review the OAA report and re-input those requirements which are still
   valid. Once input, the additives will not be selected for mechanical deletion for another year
   measured from the TRAN DATE in Section 4.
   5.4.5. The data elements found on the equipment OAA Requirements report are the same as
   discussed in Section 4 of RAR. Refer to para 5.3.7 for description.
   5.4.6. File maintenance instructions can be found in para 5.2.2.
   5.4.7. The IMS can view OAA through the RMS Display menu. Selecting OAA from the
   menu and entering the appropriate NSN will display those additives, if any, which have been
   selected for mechanical deletion.

   5.4.8. The IMS may obtain the OAA report from the RMS system by utilizing the OP menu.
5.5. General Instructions.
   5.5.1. Data within the equipment computation is either system generated or created as the
   result of some non-computation input system. The computation system has been designed
   around the philosophy that any corrections to input data will be accomplished within the
   responsible input system. Therefore, while system update capability exists, it is used only to
   facilitate the ―as of 31 March‖ and ―as of 30 September‖ buy/budget short term clean up
   cycles. Corrections file maintained in the computation system will have immediate action
   taken to update the applicable input system, if appropriate. Inputting changes throughout the
   year on the RMS product IMCD will help reduce the volume of file maintenance during
   update cycles.
   5.5.2. As stated before, only Sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 may be file maintained during the file
   maintenance window after the initial computation has been uploaded. Lines of reported data
   may be changed or deleted as well as created; instructions for file maintenance in para 5.2
   apply.
5.6. Detailed Operating Instructions.
   5.6.1. The elements found on the RAR which provide data for determining net requirements
   are:
       5.6.1.1. Peacetime requirements and in-use assets found in Section 1.
       5.6.1.2. Base/depot warehouse assets (serviceable and unserviceable) and funded/on
       order quantities found in Section 2.
       5.6.1.3. WRM requirements and in-place assets found in Section 3.
       5.6.1.4. Additive requirements and assets found in Section 4.
   5.6.2. The IA received each computation file maintenance cycle dictate the sequence in
   which the RAR products will be worked. Each computation group, based on the initial data
   input, will compute one or a combination of the following categories: termination, buy,
   budget, budget + 1, retention, excess or in an optimum condition.
   5.6.3. Termination Status. If a termination condition exists, it is created by the fact that the
   total   of     funded/on     order      plus   other    reported        assets    (in     use/in
   place/warehouse/serviceable/warehouse unserviceable) exceeds the gross requirement at the
   Budget + 1 (termination level) position.
       5.6.3.1. In reviewing the RAR, the following will be accomplished:
          5.6.3.1.1. Determine if the asset position reported is correct. Section 7, Assets by
          Condition -Reported or the PRA product can be checked to establish the number of
          assets being used in the computation.
          5.6.3.1.2. Check the funded/on order quantity. Are the assets still due in? Were any
          or all of the due-ins delivered prior to the computation cutoff date? Were the due-ins
          procured with other moneys and suppressed (i.e., FMS)? Were the due-ins canceled
          or reduced prior to the cutoff date (PR/MIPR cancellation/reduction, contract
          termination)?
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                     133


         5.6.3.1.3. Funded/on order quantities appear in RAR Section 2 by SRAN. File
         maintenance actions (add, change or delete) are accomplished as stated in para 5.2.
     5.6.3.2. The    termination     quantity    can    be     created     because     of
     missing/erroneous/incomplete requirements. Compare the computation which generated
     the procurement(s) to the current computation. Are there valid additive requirements
     which need to be added to section 4 of RAR? Is the reporting in Sections 1 and 3
     complete and accurate?
  5.6.4. Other Conditions (Buy, Budget, Budget + 1, Retention, Excess).
     5.6.4.1. Determine if the asset position reported is correct. Section 7, Assets by
     Condition -Reported, can be checked to establish the number of assets, by NSN, being
     used in the computation.
         5.6.4.1.1. If the total assets represent a gain, determine if the position is valid. Some
         possibilities causing this condition are: erroneous due-ins in Section 2; duplication of
         requirements/assets in Sections 1 or 3 and Section 4; invalid warehouse/in transit
         balances in Section 2; and customer reported satisfactory substitute assets which do
         not officially belong in the computation group (i.e., gains).
     5.6.4.2. Review additive requirements in Section 4 to determine if they are still valid.
     Check especially those additives added on prior cycles for reporting type activities.
     Check Section 4 entries against reported data in Section 1 or 2.
     5.6.4.3. Review backorders against reported data. Backorders for non-reporting special
     projects may be input as additives in Section 4. Check for authorizations established
     after the computation cutoff date as these will be input into Section 4.
     5.6.4.4. Input funded only entries in Section 2 for procurements initiated but not yet
     picked up by the J041 system as on order. Also, file maintain approved, funded
     requirements from prior year computations for which procurement has not been initiated.
     5.6.4.5. Review detailed records in Sections 1 and 2 to detect and correct duplications,
     omissions or inclusion of extraneous requirements. The IMS will apply item knowledge
     and question obvious inaccuracies. If necessary, the IMS will take necessary follow-up
     action to have MAJCOMs report correctly and completely.
     5.6.4.6. In Section 1, review authorized quantities which appear to be out of the norm.
     These can be reviewed against the applicable allowance standard to ensure the authorized
     quantity does not exceed the allowance.
     5.6.4.7. Review asset fields in Section 1 and 2 against known shipments and adjust as
     necessary. If shipment was initiated close to the computation cutoff date and is not
     reflected on the shipper’s or recipient’s records, then the quantity shipped will be shown
     as in transit. This is accomplished in Section 2 for the receiving SRAN.
     5.6.4.8. If the authorized quantity in Section 1 is not supported by in-use, DIA or
     serviceable warehouse assets, and no backorders exist for the activity, the quantity
     reported authorized may be excessive to organization’s actual needs. Verify the reported
     authorization.

      5.6.4.9. If the authorized quantity in Section 1 exceeds the in-use asset total, with
      serviceable warehouse assets reported by the base, the quantity reported authorized may
      be excessive. Verify the reported authorization.
      5.6.4.10. Review records with system edit error codes and correct, if possible.
      5.6.4.11. The MDS field may be changed, if needed, to provide a more definitive
      breakout of weapon system requirements. The MDS has no effect on the net quantities
      computed, but it is needed for funding purposes. Ensuring the correctness of reported
      MDS will help produce a more reliable WSP.
      5.6.4.12. Review status of assets shipped to contractors and include as additive
      requirements if they were not mechanically input. No practical method exists to
      mechanically recognize these assets when returned from the contractor. Note: Receipts
      on ALC document numbers or contractor shipping documents, and manually update
      authorization and asset position when required. Take action periodically, through
      contracting officials, to verify the status of these assets.
      5.6.4.13. Review Section 6 summary data to detect obvious duplications, omissions, or
      numeric errors applicable to authorization and in service assets. This review might reveal
      that a particular command’s reported data in Sections 1, 3 and 4 will be reviewed in detail
      and corrective actions are necessary.

                  GROSS AND NET REQUIREMENTS PROJECTIONS

6.1. Purpose. The primary function of the D039 is to provide defensible buy and budget net
requirements for use in procurement plans and budget estimates. Essential elements of this
function are:
   6.1.1. Projection of gross requirements based on current AF plans and programs. Currently
   a 7-year projection is used.
   6.1.2. Application and allocation of available and funded and on-order assets according to
   priorities and other prescribed criteria for projected requirements.
   6.1.3. Development of net requirements in advance of actual need to permit acquisition and
   delivery concurrent with or prior to the actual need.
   6.1.4. Identify potential candidates for termination action or retention. Identify potential
   excess assets for use in other services or for disposal action.
6.2. Terms Explained: Projected Requirements and Assets (PRA). Figures 6.1. thorough
6.4. are numbered copies of PRA Screens. Tables 6.1. through 6.4. (below each figure) describe
the numbers in sequence:

 Notes:
 1. This product cannot be file maintained. It is a summary product and will change as a
 result of file maintenance accomplished in the IMCD, RAR (sections 1, 3, & 4), and WS.
 2. During IMCD file maintenance, the Budget Control Code and Standard Price will
 change on this product once the message ―Update Successful‖ is received. A successful
 change in the Lead Time will cause the quarter and years of the Buy through Bud+5
 positions to change.
 3. During the RAR file maintenance, only the Reported position will change for all
 requirement fields.
 4. During the WS file maintenance windows, Requirement categories can be changed at
 any program position across the FYDP. The PRA will reflect those changes once the
 message ―Update Successful‖ is received.

        (i.e., 31 March, 30 September). RPT position on the computation represents the ―as of
        date.‖ This position will show requirements and assets as reported in AFEMS on this
        date. Note: Gross and net requirements are not computed for this position. Data shown
        in this program position will not be altered by system logic.

       6.2.1.2. Current Operating Position. This is the fourth quarter of the procurement FY
       being computed. Note: Application of forecasted requirements and the economic
       alignment of assets have affected the data in this position and beyond.
       6.2.1.3. Buy Position. The current operating position plus procurement lead time for the
       computation group adjusted to the nearest program position.
       6.2.1.4. Budget Position. The current operating position plus procurement lead time plus
       12 months adjusted to the nearest program position.
   6.2.2. Category Explanations
       6.2.2.1. Gross Requirements. The quantity of approved authorizations and other justified
       AF needs for a given equipment item.
       6.2.2.2. Assets. In-service assets are the sum of the In-Use and the In-Place assets.
           6.2.2.2.1. In-Use Assets. On-hand assets being used to satisfy AF requirements at
           the reporting date.
           6.2.2.2.2. In-Place Assets. On-hand assets being held at designated locations to
           offset WRM requirements.
       6.2.2.3. Net Requirements. Gross requirements less applied, reapplied, and allocated
       assets.
           6.2.2.3.1. Applied. In-service assets being used in the organization where reported or
           in the re-designated organization.
           6.2.2.3.2. Reapplied.    In-service assets which are excess to their reported
           organization and base serviceable assets mechanically assigned, based on location, to
           remaining shortages.
           6.2.2.3.3. Allocated. All remaining assets (in-service, warehouse serviceable,
           warehouse unserviceable, due-in and funded) assigned within I&SG to all remaining
           requirements (including calculated replacements).
6.3. Projection. Within the requirements computation, approved authorizations are projected
seven years (25 to 28 quarters depending on the processing cycle cut-off date). The data related
to the quarters considered to be the most significant for requirements computation purposes are
selected for display on the PRA Report.
6.4. Projection/Methodology. All gross requirements are projected using a FY and quarter
phasing indicator in each detailed authorization record to indicate when the authorized quantity
will be effective. See the following example:
 144                                                          AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011

The computer will phase gross requirements in the following manner:
FY 4/08    4/09          1/10           2/10         3/10          4/10             4/11

Note: New quantities will replace old authorized quantities completely.


   6.4.1. Forecast data input by AFEMS are used to adjust existing authorizations and are
   matched to existing records (starting with the FY and quarter that the forecasted quantity
   becomes effective), on authorized NSN, MAJCOM, organization identification, MDS, and
   allowance identification. If a forecast record is unmatched to an existing record on the above
   elements, the forecast will be used to generate gross requirements starting with the FY and
   quarter that the forecast quantity becomes effective (acting in the same manner as a new
   activation). Forecast data is used to adjust requirements on an item basis rather than an
   organization basis. If the forecast record contains a date that is already passed, the record
   would be discarded. For example, the date in the forecast record is 2/07 but the current date
   is 3/07, the forecast record will be discarded.
   6.4.2. Additive requirements can contain forecast dates also. These records will be handled
   like all other forecasts.
6.5. Non-Vehicle Items. Vehicles are discussed beginning with para 6 15.
   6.5.1. Objective. Asset alignment is based on the following:
       6.5.1.1. Customers will be furnished an item that is both suitable and satisfactory for
       their use.
       6.5.1.2. The I&S system is the source for the OOU for assets.
          6.5.1.2.1. Assets from a lower capability computation group will not be allocated to
          satisfy requirements in a higher capability group.
          6.5.1.2.2. Assets for items administratively condemned with a parts preference codes
          4 or 9 in the I&S record, are considered unsuitable and are not used to satisfy
          projected requirements. However, these assets will be shown in the ―as of,‖ RPT
          position as they are reported by the using organization, but will not be considered
          during the computation process for use at any future position (reference RAR, Section
          9 or WSP, Section 5).
       6.5.1.3. Assets will be aligned to gross requirements in a predetermined order that is both
       economical and practical. The system considers the standard price, need, and I&S
       structure.
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                    145


         6.5.1.3.1. A variance in the standard price, greater than $500, is a determining factor.
         A high-cost item has a standard price at least $500 more than the authorized item’s
         standard price.
             6.5.1.3.1.1. When high-cost items are not required in their home computation
             group, they will be applied as originally reported. However, if there is a
             requirement in the home computation group, the system will return the high-cost,
             out-of-computation group (substitute) asset to its home computation group.
         6.5.1.3.2. The I&S structure determines when the high-cost, substitute, asset is
         returned to its home computation group.
             6.5.1.3.2.1. For a high cost substitute in the same I&SG as the authorized item,
             but a different home computation group, the return of the substitute to the home
             computation group is on an independent quarter-by-quarter basis to enable
             maximum use of assets.
             6.5.1.3.2.2. For a high-cost , out-of-I&SG substitute, displacement cannot be
             made on a quarter-by-quarter basis because of the lack of a positive relationship
             between I&SGs. Therefore, a check is made at the budget position for non-vehicle
             items as to whether the asset is needed in its home (higher cost) computation
             group. If so, it is returned, beginning with the second program position and
             continuing through the last program position.
     6.5.1.4. All substitute in-service assets will be recognized with the exception of those the
     using activity coded unsatisfactory. Non-equipment type in-service substitutes are
     assigned to the reporting organization as long as its requirement exists (includes
     unidentified and local purchase). When the initial requirement is removed, the non-
     equipment type item being used as a substitute is dropped from the computation. The
     dropped asset is shown in the RAR, Section 9.
     6.5.1.5. Assets identified to an ownership purpose code are first used to satisfy that
     requirement. Assets, excess to this requirement, are used to satisfy other account
     shortages within the same computation group. Following this, the next consideration is
     the same ownership account in lower capability computation groups.
  6.5.2. Identification and Adjustment of Assets. No assets will be displaced for the first
  (cutoff date) program position as actual reported data are required to maintain asset integrity
  for management consideration and comparison purposes. The following steps identify
  various conditions of assets and displace from the reporting records those assets not meeting
  certain criteria.
     6.5.2.1. Step 1. All assets coded 4 or 9 in the sequence (parts preference) field are
     considered unsuitable in the I&SG and are identified and considered displaced from the
     reporting organization except in the ―as of‖ reporting position. These assets have been
     determined to be unsuitable for AF use due to technical or safety reasons and assets are
     removed from the supply system as soon as possible. These assets are not used to offset
     requirements for the second and succeeding program positions. All are unsuitable excess
     unless TRC 34 (Directed-to-Hold) or 39 (Elected-to-Hold) additives are used.
146                                                          AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011


      6.5.2.2. Step 2. All assets coded unsatisfactory by the reporting organization (reported
      with item code ―U‖ in the detailed in-use in-place record) which belong to a computation
      group other than the authorized item, are displaced and returned to home computation
      group for use elsewhere in the computation. The user will be provided an item from the
      home computation group of the authorized item if possible. Since it is an objective of
      AFMC to provide customers with the materiel they need, the asset is withdrawn for
      requirements purposes to fill a potential shortage in home computation group and allow
      customers to provide the item required.
      6.5.2.3. Step 3. Assets are identified to the appropriate ownership account. TOC assets
      will be assigned 0D in order to distinguish from other serviceable assets on the RAR. All
      other assets will be assigned to account 0A. For computation purposes, 0D is combined
      with 0A.
      6.5.2.4. Step 4. Authorized preferred (item code ―P‖) and substitute (item code ―S‖) in-
      use, in-place asset quantities are checked for peacetime and WRM records only. If the
      sum of these asset quantities exceeds the authorized quantity, all assets (including item
      code ―M‖ assets) exceeding the authorized quantity are displaced and used within their
      computation group or I&SG, for consideration against other valid authorized
      requirements.
      6.5.2.5. Step 5. All Multiple Components (Item Code ―M‖) assets will be displaced and
      used within their computation group or I&SG.
         6.5.2.5.1. If the sum of the authorized preferred (item code ―P‖) and substitute (item
         code ―S‖) assets does not exceed the authorized quantity, a quantity of authorization,
         not to exceed the difference or the quantity of multiple component substitute assets,
         will be created for the computation group of the substitute. The authorized quantity
         of the initially reported record will be reduced by the largest quantity created for the
         multiple components.
         6.5.2.5.2. The RAR shows the data as reported and as used in the computation by
         dual line entries within the appropriate computation groupings.
         6.5.2.5.3. For details, see Attachment 2.
      6.5.2.6. Step 6. All detailed authorization and in-use in-place records are screened, and
      I&SGs using in-service assets from other I&SGs to fill a shortage are identified. Unit
      cost of assets and the authorized item are compared (excluding vehicles).
         6.5.2.6.1. If the variance is $500 or less, assets are denoted as ―Low Cost out of I& S
         Group‖ and are left in service where reported to offset the reported authorization.
         6.5.2.6.2. If the variance is $501 or more, assets are identified as ―High Cost out of
         I& S Group.‖ These assets are subject to being moved to their computation group in
         later processing if a need develops for these high cost assets.
      6.5.2.7. Step 7. All detailed authorization and in-use in-place asset records are screened.
      All computation groups using in-service assets from other computation groups within the
      same I&SG to fill a shortage are identified, and comparison made of the unit cost of asset
      computation group and authorization computation group.
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                    147


        6.5.2.7.1. If the variance is $500 or less, assets are identified as ―Low Cost in I&SG‖
        and left where reported to fill the reported authorization.
        6.5.2.7.2. If the variance is $501 or more, assets are identified as ―High-Cost in
        I&SG.‖ These high cost assets are subject to being moved to their home computation
        group to satisfy shortages there, if required, during later processing.
     6.5.2.8. Step 8. All the remaining assets in the computation are identified to one of the
     following types:
        6.5.2.8.1. In-service (in-use/in-place installed):
            6.5.2.8.1.1. In-service assets for the authorized NSN will be referred to as
            authorized in-service. These assets are identified on the RAR with item code ―P.‖
            Assets reported with, but not excess to additive requirements will be referred to as
            authorized in-service.
            6.5.2.8.1.2. Substitute in-service assets are applicable only to peacetime and
            WRM records, and will be identified on the RAR with item code ―S,‖ ―U,‖ or
            ―M.‖
        6.5.2.8.2. Serviceable assets. Base serviceable assets are the sum of the serviceable
        asset quantity and the in transit asset quantity from the base (SRAN) asset records.
        6.5.2.8.3. Unserviceable assets:
            6.5.2.8.3.1. Base unserviceable assets are the asset quantity from the
            unserviceable assets of the base (SRAN) unserviceable records.
            6.5.2.8.3.2. ALC unserviceable assets are the asset quantity from the
            unserviceable asset quantity of the ALC unserviceable asset records.
        6.5.2.8.4. Due-in assets (contract, PR, MIPR, funded, etc.) are applicable to the DIA
        quantity from both the base (SRAN) asset records and the IM or SM ALC asset
        records. Funded assets are the assets from the IM or SM ALC-funded assets records
        as appearing in Section 2 of the RAR.
  6.5.3. Applying In-service Assets. The necessary steps are taken to apply assets to
  requirements. Assets used during this process are limited to those assets the using
  organizations report as in-service.
     6.5.3.1. In-service assets after being subjected to the variation process described in steps
     1 through 8 are coded to satisfy the requirement where they were initially reported.
     Normally the assets would be retained to satisfy these requirements as long as the
     reporting organization remains in being.
     6.5.3.2. In the first ―as of‖ position, the assets will be shown as they were initially
     reported. Adequate quantities of the authorized assets or satisfactory substitutes will be
     applied to the requirement at the second program position and all succeeding positions as
     long as the requirement remains. The quantity of applied assets cannot increase from one
     program position to the next and cannot exceed the gross requirement for each applicable
     position.

      6.5.3.3. Step 9. Starting in the second program position, in-service assets within their
      own computation group will be applied first to the organization reporting the asset.
      Assets will be applied to the MDS against which assets were reported before they are
      applied to other MDS codes with the same organization. Any assets which become
      excess at any program position due to organization phase-down will be considered for
      reapplication in that position and all succeeding positions.
      6.5.3.4. Step 10. Low-cost in I&SG (out of computation group) in-service assets will be
      applied next, starting with the second program position. Any of these assets which
      become excess to the unit at any program position will be forwarded to the home
      computation group in that position and all succeeding positions and considered for
      reapplication in the home computation group.
      6.5.3.5. Step 11. Low-cost out of I&SG in-service assets will be applied to the unit
      reporting the asset at all program positions in sufficient quantities to offset the gross
      requirements at the budget position. Any asset applied at this position which is excess at
      any other position will be identified in the excess positions as ―retained for application.‖
      Any asset not applied in this position will be forwarded to the home computation group
      in all positions starting with the second program position and used in reapplication to the
      home computation group.
      6.5.3.6. Step 12. Unidentified (to I&SG) in-service assets will be applied starting in the
      second program position to the unit reporting them as suitable substitutes. Any of these
      assets which become excess to the unit at any program position will be considered as
      ―excess unsuitable‖ in that position and all succeeding program positions.
      6.5.3.7. Step 13. High-cost in I&SG in-service assets will be ―tentatively applied‖ at all
      program positions starting with the second position. Any of these assets which become
      excess at any position will be forwarded to the home computation group in that position
      and all succeeding positions to be considered for reapplication. The ―tentatively applied‖
      high-cost in ISG assets will be considered as available to the home computation group for
      allotment and realignment of assets, and if the home computation group requires the item
      at any program position, a quantity sufficient to offset the requirement will be sent home
      in that position.
      6.5.3.8. Step 14. High-cost out of I&SG in-service (out of computation group) assets
      will be ―tentatively applied‖ at all program positions in sufficient quantities to offset the
      gross requirement at the budget position. These ―tentatively applied‖ high-cost out of
      ISG assets will be considered as available to the home computation group (only) during
      the allotment realignment of assets. If the home computation group requires the item at
      the budget position, a quantity sufficient to offset the requirements will be sent home in
      all positions starting at the second position. That quantity the home computation group
      does not require will be retained with the reporting unit as applied. Any of these which
      are excess at any position other than the budget will be identified as ―retained for
      application.‖ Any ―high-cost‖ out of ISG in-service not required at the budget position
      will be forwarded to the home computation group in all positions, starting with the
      second position, to be considered for reapplication.
  6.5.4. Reapplication of Assets. Upon completion of application procedures, steps are taken
  to reapply any in-service assets in excess to application steps and any serviceable base assets
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                      149


  belonging to home computation group. These are the only types of assets used during
  reapplication procedures.
     6.5.4.1. The following general procedures are used in the reapplication area:
        6.5.4.1.1. Detailed unit shortages are developed by subtracting applied in-service
        assets from phased gross requirements for each organization.
        6.5.4.1.2. Allocation Priority (AP) is assigned to each organization and or detail-
        phased requirement record to indicate a ranking in relationship to other organizations
        or records. Within location at each program position, assets will be reapplied first to
        unit shortages having the highest AP. For example, units with AP ―1‖ having a
        shortage will be given the best assets first on a first-come, first-served basis. Any
        remaining assets will be reapplied to unit shortage for AP ―2,‖ etc.
        6.5.4.1.3. The term ―within location‖ is used at each program position with reference
        to the location of the assets as of the previous program position. The four location
        levels at which assets are reapplied ―within location‖ are:
            6.5.4.1.3.1. To units within a SRAN;
        6.5.4.1.3.2. To units on other bases in the area having shortages within the same
        command;
            6.5.4.1.3.3. To units on other bases in the same area regardless of command; and
            6.5.4.1.3.4. To units on other bases in other areas.
     6.5.4.2. The same overriding principles in para 6.5.3 for application procedures will also
     be effective for reapplication. In addition, the area location of the assets and allocation
     priority of the unit will govern the reapplication of assets to detail unit shortages at each
     program position.
     6.5.4.3. Step 15. At each program position starting with the second, serviceable base
     stock and in-service unit excess assets, in that order, will be reapplied to other units on
     the same base if a shortage exists.
     6.5.4.4. Step 16. If no unit shortages are in the SRAN where the assets are located, the
     assets will be reapplied to unit shortages in other SRANs within the same command
     within the same area, if there are shortages.
     6.5.4.5. Step 17. If no unit shortages are within the command, within the area, assets
     will be reapplied to unit shortages of other commands within the area.
     6.5.4.6. Step 18. If no unit shortages are within the area, assets will be reapplied to unit
     shortages on bases located in other areas.
     6.5.4.7. Step 19. If no shortages are in other areas, assets will be retained for allotment
     and alignment in this program position and in all succeeding program positions.
     6.5.4.8. Step 20. When an asset is reapplied to a unit shortage on a base at any of the
     levels indicated above (SRAN, command within area, area, WW) and then becomes
     excess at the next quarter position to the unit to which it was assigned, it will be reapplied
     in the next quarter starting within SRAN as indicated.

  6.5.5. Allotment, Realignment, and Allocation of Assets. All remaining available assets are
  related to all unsatisfied gross requirements and adjustments are made to make sure assets are
  used to provide the best support. In-service and base serviceable assets were considered
  during application and reapplication procedures. Assets to be considered during allotment
  and realignment are serviceable base excess, serviceable ALC, excess in-service,
  unserviceable base assets, unserviceable ALC, high-cost asset in-service as substitutes (steps
  13 and 14), due-in, and funded quantity assets. For requirements purpose, these assets are
  more or less considered under the control of the IMS, and distribution, redistribution or other
  management actions are not only feasible, but required of the IMS. Therefore, the
  requirements computation attempts to mechanically allocate assets on a quarter-by-quarter
  basis to provide maximum use of the most desirable assets.
      6.5.5.1. One of the first considerations during allotment procedures is to determine if in-
      service high-cost (steps 13 and 14) assets will be returned to their home computation
      group. Every attempt is made to leave these high-cost assets where they were reported by
      consideration of any suitable assets (that is, within the same computation group or excess
      higher capability assets) except the funded quantity or on procurement. The following
      steps 21 through 24 are in the form of a sub cycle within the computation to determine
      the quantity, by bulk, of high-cost assets to be realigned or brought home to their own
      computation group.
         6.5.5.1.1. Step 21. Computation group shortages existing against total gross
         requirements after assets have been applied and reapplied at the budget position are
         determined. Budget position was chosen since it is a significant funding position, and
         net buy requirements for non-vehicle items are adjusted down to the net budget
         quantity, if buy quantity is computed higher than budget quantity.
         6.5.5.1.2. Step 22. By using the OOU and parts preference codes assigned from the
         I&S program, any assets excess to their home computation are realigned or filtered
         down to fill shortages in lower capability computation groups. The type assets used
         in this operation are: base serviceable and excess in-service assets available after
         application/reapplication, serviceable ALC assets, unserviceable base assets, and
         unserviceable ALC assets in that order. Due-in and funded only assets are not used at
         this point.
         6.5.5.1.3. Step 23. Another check is made to determine if any shortages exist after
         step 22 has been completed. If any shortage exists, high-cost assets are realigned, or
         pulled back, to their home computation group to fill any shortage there. Assets
         belonging to highest unit cost are considered first to prevent computer recycling.
         6.5.5.1.4. Step 24. Another check is made to determine if any shortages were caused
         when high-cost assets were sent home. If any shortages do exist, Step 22 is repeated
         to filter any excess high capability assets down to fill lower capability shortages.
      6.5.5.2. The quantity of assets determined to be required by an I&SG are not frozen to
      requirements in the same manner as applied and reapplied assets, but rather, may differ
      from quarter-to-quarter by computation group to provide maximum use of available
      assets for authorized requirements. Excess assets are filtered down to lower capability
      groups, or pulled back to higher capability groups in the same manner as steps 21 through
      24 above on a quarter-by-quarter basis. However, while individual computation groups
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                     151


     may show a variance in assets, the I&SG as a whole will not show a variance on the
     PRA, except for the assets dropped from the computation and printed on the RAR,
     Section 9.
     6.5.5.3. After the determination has been made as to how many high-cost assets are
     required along with the home computation group assets, the requirements computation
     will make the best use of available assets within the I&SG. Table 6.6 shows the order in
     which assets are used to satisfy existing shortages. The alphabetical codes indicate
     computation groups within an I&SG. The numeric codes indicate the OOU. For
     example, if enough serviceable base assets are available in computation group AD to
     satisfy the entire I&SG shortage, then these assets are the only ones used. If insufficient
     quantities of these assets are available, then serviceable ALC assets are used, etc.
     6.5.5.4. To accomplish the objective shown in Table 6.6, the following techniques are
     used:
        6.5.5.4.1. Step 25. Starting with lowest capable computation group with a shortage,
        and continuing to the highest, realign the remaining assets. Limited capability assets
        are used first. The remaining assets, starting with the least capable, are then used until
        either all shortages are filled or all available remaining assets are used.
        6.5.5.4.2. Step 26. Excess assets still remaining in any computation group will be
        realigned to replace assets in lower capable computation groups for which they can be
        substituted (based on the I&S OOU coding) according to Table 6.6 (Note: No
        substitutable assets will remain in higher capable computation groups.)
        6.5.5.4.3. Step 27. Starting with the highest capable computation group with
        remaining (overage) assets, replace the next lower capable computation group allotted
        assets with higher capable computation group overages; these can be used as a
        substitute until all higher capable computation group overages, which can be used as
        a substitute, have been used within the ISG.
        6.5.5.4.4. Step 28. Replacement will be in order of funded, DIA, unserviceable
        ALC, etc.
        6.5.5.4.5. Step 29. After assets have been allotted in bulk to computation groups,
        specific assets will be allocated, or given in equal percentages, to detailed
        organization shortages on an independent quarter-by-quarter basis.

   6.5.6. Replacement Requirements. Replacement requirements are computed by individual
   organization and summarized for total replacement requirement for each computation group.
   Replacement factors do not apply to WRM authorizations or the SAP. Also, no replacement
   is computed for additives with a TRC of 49 or less, nor does D039 project replacement for
   ASCs of 000, 014, 040, 044, 047, 048, 048AA, 049, 050, 052, 053, 054, 055, 057, 058, 064,
   076, 986, 987, or STBY. They are developed under one of four methods based on the
   replacement criteria codes in the IMCD control codes. Note: Additives with a TRC of 10-15
   and 93-99 will show a replacement along with the computed replacement. These methods
   are:
       6.5.6.1. Replacement criteria codes ―A,‖ ―C,‖ or ―G‖ indicate a replacement factor is
       available and will be used to mechanically calculate replacement needs. The factor is
       adjusted for each program position by use of the time factor. The sum of in-service and
       warehouse assets applied, reapplied, and allocated at each program position to an active
       AF requirement is multiplied by the adjusted replacement factor to obtain the
       replacement requirement for that position. Additional replacement requirements may be
       entered as additives in the RAR, Section 4.
          6.5.6.2. Replacement criteria codes ―B‖ or ―D‖ indicate the replacement factors are
          computed for each program year based on PULE criteria. The factors shown in the
          IMCD Section E have already been adjusted for each program year. This factor is
          used for each program position related to that year. The sum of in-service and
          warehouse assets applied, reapplied, and allocated at each program position to an
          active AF requirement is multiplied by the applicable factor to obtain the replacement
          requirement for that position. Additional replacement requirements may be entered in
          the RAR, Section 4.
       6.5.6.3. Replacement Criteria Codes ―E‖ (ORTEM), ―F‖ (TO), or ―H‖ (Not enough data
       to mechanically compute) indicate the replacement requirements are to be developed
       outside of the normal system. Total replacement requirements must be entered as
       additives in the RAR, Section 4.
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                    153


       6.5.6.4. Replacement requirements for vehicles controlled under the REMS are
       computed under special procedures defined in the vehicle peculiarities section of this
       chapter (paras 6-19). These items are identified by a ―V‖ in the equipment code on the
       IMCD. The replacement criteria code and replacement factor for these items must be
       blank.
   6.5.7. Allocation to Replacement. Remaining available assets will be allocated to satisfy
   computed replacement requirements using the procedures in steps 21 through 29 above. If
   suitable assets have been displaced and shown as surplus, they will be reallocated if this
   action will free items suitable for use to satisfy replacement needs. Note: No assets are
   allocated to replacement requirements until all other needs are filled.
   6.5.8. Net Requirements. After reducing the individual gross requirements by the related
   applied, reapplied, and allocated assets, the remaining shortages constitute the net
   requirements.
   6.5.9. Requirements Summaries. Gross requirements, the sum of applied, reapplied, and
   allocated assets and net requirements; applied and reapplied assets; allocated assets; and net
   requirements are summarized by MDS and MAJCOM for display on the WSP.
6.6. Vehicular items.
   6.6.1. Gross Requirements. Processing of gross requirements for vehicles is the same as for
   non-vehicles (reference paras 6.1. through 6.9).
   6.6.2. Asset Alignment. Peculiarities are most significant in the method assets are aligned to
   gross requirements. While the objective is the same as for non-vehicles, that is, to achieve
   the most economical use of assets, the policy consideration dictates some change in
   techniques. For continuity and clarity, all vehicle asset alignment procedures are in this
   section, even though some repetition between vehicle and non-vehicle procedures may be
   noted. Significant action steps are numbered throughout the narrative.
   6.6.3. Review and Displacement. One of the first series of steps to be taken during
   economical asset alignment for vehicles is to review authorization and asset records and then
   identify and displace those assets from authorization records which do not meet a certain
   criteria. Displacement of assets will occur on the second and all succeeding program
   positions.
       6.6.3.1. Step 1. Asset records are reviewed for I&SG suitability codes. All unsuitable
       assets, as determined by 4 or 9 sequence (parts preference) code on the IMCD, are
       displaced. Value of these assets is reported on the IDSS, but they are not used to offset
       authorizations. If authorizations exist for these items, higher capability assets may be
       used to offset authorization, or dollars will be computed for procurement of a suitable
       asset.
       6.6.3.2. Step 2. Asset records are reviewed for a coding of satisfactory by the using
       organization. All records coded with a ―U‖ in the item code field of the RAR are
       displaced and returned to their own computation group. If an asset in the same
       computation group as the authorized item is reported with a ―U‖ item code, the code is
       changed to ―S.‖ Note: A ―U‖ is an expression of opinion by the user and may be
       unrelated to the I&SG parts preference suitability code.
154                                                           AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011


      6.6.3.3. Step 3. Authorization and in-use/in-place quantities are reviewed. All quantities
      excess to authorization are displaced and forwarded to proper computation groups for
      possible use to fill other authorizations.
      6.6.3.4. Step 4. All in-use/in-place substitute assets belonging to computation group in
      other I&SGs are returned to home computation groups, and are not applied or reapplied
      to the reporting computation groups.
      6.6.3.5. Step 5. All the remaining assets will belong to the computation group where
      reported or are unidentified or non-vehicle assets. Computation group assets will consist
      of in-use/in-place and DIAs from contract, PR, MIPR, and funded assets. No warehouse
      assets will be shown for vehicles; authorized/in-use or in-place records will be created for
      these type assets. The unidentified or non-vehicle assets will always consist of in-service
      assets. If they are satisfactory to the using activity as denoted by an ―S‖ or ―M‖ in the
      item code field on RAR, they are left in-service where reported until the reporting
      activity no longer requires the item. At this point, the assets are released from active
      authorization and printed on the RAR, Section 9.
  6.6.4. Determination of Assets Eligible for Replacement. Assets eligible for replacement are
  determined for each vehicle by the vehicle replacement code (AFMAN 23-110, V3, P4, C7,
  Table                         7A2.1.                      at                    http://www.e-
  publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/PUBS/AF/23/23011003/030407/030407.pdf) or by
  the combination of age and life expectancy. Replacement will occur based on whichever
  method determines the earliest position. This replacement may be programmed to occur at
  any of several positions; however, the buy and budget positions are the most significant ones
  for this phase of computation. The computation of replacement quantities is especially
  important due to funding policies. Funding for initial gross requirements is held to a
  minimum because it has been determined that enough vehicles are already in the supply
  system to fill these initial requirements, and that only replacements will be funded. For this
  reason, necessary steps are taken during asset alignment to assign some assets which are
  eligible for replacement to authorizations, so that funds will be computed under the desired
  criteria.
  6.6.5. Application or Reapplication. In-service assets are applied or reapplied to phased
  gross requirements after all assets have been identified by type and condition. Some general
  definitions and objectives:
      6.6.5.1. Application-To project the anticipated use of the in-use/in-place assets into the
      future with the organization reporting the asset.
      6.6.5.2. Reapplication-To project into the future, by program position for each unit, the
      use of in-use/in-place assets excess to other units after application procedures have been
      completed.
      6.6.5.3. Reapplication of assets will only occur within AF ownership account OA.
      6.6.5.4. There will be no reapplication by SRAN for additive requirements since these
      are not identified to a SRAN in all cases.
      6.6.5.5. The first (cutoff) program position, as shown on the PRA, will reflect assets as
      reported. All assets applied or reapplied to second and all succeeding program positions
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                    155


     will be in sufficient quantities to offset the requirements without increasing the quantity
     from one program position to another. All assets applied or reapplied to a unit’s
     authorizations will be retained by that unit so long as the authorization exists through
     reorganizations, conversions, movement, or transfer. When assets are no longer required
     for application or reapplication, they will become available to fill other possible
     shortages.
     6.6.5.6. In-service assets eligible for replacement reported for a computation group will
     be applied and reapplied to initial gross requirements, not to exceed the total gross
     requirement minus the total non-eligible at the budget program position.
     6.6.5.7. Any assets reported out of I&SG will be forwarded to the home computation
     group for consideration in reapplication along with other reported in-service assets for the
     computation group.
     6.6.5.8. Vehicle replacement requirements will be computed for both in-place and in-use
     vehicle eligible assets applied or reapplied. These replacement shortages will be included
     with the initial issue requirements remaining after application and reapplication.
     6.6.5.9. Reapplication of assets will be done by consideration of asset and authorization
     location and allocation priority. Table 13.3 describes AP codes.
  6.6.6. Detailed Application and Reapplication Steps. Assets will be applied or reapplied in
  the following order:
     6.6.6.1. Step 7. In-service (in-use/in-place) assets in the home computation group will
     be applied starting in the second program position. However, the total quantity of applied
     assets eligible for replacement at any position will not exceed the difference between the
     total gross requirement and the total non-eligible in-service assets for computation group.
     If the total quantity of applied assets exceed the difference at any program position prior
     to the budget position, but does not exceed the difference between the total gross
     requirement and the total non-eligible in-service assets at the budget position, the asset
     will be applied through the budget position. Any of these in-service assets (including
     those eligible for replacement) which become excess (cannot be applied) to the unit at
     any program position will be considered for reapplication at that position and all
     succeeding positions.
     6.6.6.2. Step 8. Low-cost in I&SG, but out of computation group in-service assets will
     be applied starting in the second program position. However, the total quantity of applied
     assets eligible for replacement at any position will not exceed the difference between the
     total gross requirement and the total non-eligible in-service assets for the computation
     group. If the total quantity of applied assets exceed the difference at any program
     position prior to the budget position, but does not exceed the difference between the total
     gross requirement and the total non-eligible in-service assets at the budget position, the
     asset will be applied through the budget position. Any of these assets (including those
     eligible for replacement) which become excess (cannot be applied) to the unit at any
     program position will be forwarded to the home computation group in that position and
     all succeeding positions and considered for reapplication the home computation group.
     6.6.6.3. Step 9. In-service assets will be applied at all program positions in sufficient
     quantities to offset the gross requirement at the buy position. (EXCEPTION: If the total
156                                                           AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011


      applied assets at the budget position exceed the difference between the total gross
      requirement and the total non-eligible at the budget position, the asset will not be applied
      at the buy position.) Any asset not applied in this position will be forwarded to the home
      computation group in all positions starting with the second program position and used in
      reapplication to the home computation group.
      6.6.6.4. Step 10. Unidentified in-service assets will be applied starting in the second
      program position to the unit reporting them as suitable substitutes. Any of these assets
      which become excess to the unit at any program position will be considered as ―excess
      unsuitable‖ in that position and all succeeding program positions.
      6.6.6.5. Step 11. High-cost in I&SG in-service, but out of computation group non-
      eligible asset, will be ―tentatively applied‖ at all program positions starting with the
      second position. Eligible assets will be processed in the same manner as the low-cost in
      I&SG in-service assets. The ―tentatively applied‖ high-cost in I&SG will be considered
      as available to the home computation group for allotment and realignment of assets in
      further processing. If the home computation group required the item at any program
      position, a quantity sufficient to offset the requirement will be sent to the home
      computation group in that position.
      6.6.6.6. Step 12. In-service unit excess will be reapplied to other units on the same
      SRAN within the same command if a shortage exists.
      6.6.6.7. Step 13. If no unit shortages are within the same command in the SRAN where
      the assets are located, the assets will be reapplied to unit shortages in another SRAN
      within the same command within the same area.
      6.6.6.8. Step 14. If no unit shortages are within the command within the area, assets will
      be reapplied to unit shortages for the same command regardless of area to which they are
      last assigned.
      6.6.6.9. Step 15. If no unit shortages are within the command, the assets will be
      reapplied to unit shortages on bases located in other areas and commands.
      6.6.6.10. Step 16. If no shortages are in any area WW, non-eligible assets will be
      retained for allotment and alignment in this program position and all succeeding program
      positions. Eligible assets not used during reapplication will become ―excess unsuitable‖
      and listed on the RAR, Section 9.
      6.6.6.11. Step 17. When an asset is reapplied to a unit shortage on a base at any of the
      levels indicated above, and then become excess at the next quarter position to the unit to
      which it was assigned, it will be reapplied in the next quarter, starting within SRAN as
      outlined in previous steps.
  6.6.7. Asset Allotment and Alignment. Upon completion of application and reapplication
  procedures, the assets remaining are used in bulk to offset remaining authorizations on an
  independent, quarter-to-quarter basis.
      6.6.7.1. Allotment is the giving of assets to a computation group with no attempt at
      detailed distribution.
      6.6.7.2. Realignment is the movement of assets between computation groups.
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                        157


       6.6.7.3. Realignment will occur between computation groups according to OOU codes of
       the I&SG.
   6.6.8. Detailed Allotment and Realignment Steps:
       6.6.8.1. Step 18. Any in-service assets not eligible for replacement and excess to home
       computation group are realigned to lower capability computation groups and allotted in
       bulk to offset any computation group shortages existing after application and
       reapplication. Any assets realigned to fill authorizations in a lower capability
       computation group, which are at least $500 lower than the cost of the asset computation
       group, are tentatively realigned.
       6.6.8.2. Step 19. A check is made of computation groups’ authorization and asset totals.
       Any shortages remaining are filled by the following assets:
          6.6.8.2.1. High-cost assets tentatively realigned in Step 18; and
          6.6.8.2.2. High-cost assets tentatively applied in Step 11.
       6.6.8.3. Step 20. When the high-cost tentatively applied, reapplied, and realigned assets
       are returned to their home computation group, a shortage will be created. To fill these
       created shortages, assets are realigned and allotted again in attempt to fill these shortages.
       The computer will use a technique of starting with the high-cost computation group and
       proceed to lower-cost computation groups in order to preclude a recycling effect. Assets
       used in this realignment include DIA, funded assets, and any excess assets not eligible for
       replacement. The order in which assets are used as demonstrated in Table 6.7 The
       numbers indicate the sequence in which computation group AD, AC, AB, and AA assets
       are to be used. AD is the highest capability item and AA is the lowest.

Table 6.7. Vehicle Allotment and Realignment

Note: Any asset input to the computation through additive requirements record will be
processed as a non-eligible (replacement code T).
       6.6.8.4. Step 21. Assets are allocated or assigned to detail authorization records.
       6.6.8.5. Step 22. Net requirements are computed by subtracting the total applied,
       reapplied, and allocated assets from the total gross requirements. Replacement
       requirements will be equal to the total applied and reapplied assets eligible for
       replacement. The net is shown on the NRL and PRA.
   6.6.9. Net Requirements by Location.
       6.6.9.1. Purpose. To show individual gross requirement data as reflected on the format
       RAR projected through the computation period by location. Portrayal of assets aligned to
       these projected gross requirements will show resulting net requirements at the stated
       positions.
158                                                          AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011


         6.6.9.1.1. The NRL was developed to show by individual computation group the
         gross requirements, aligned allocated assets, and net requirements by location.
         6.6.9.1.2. Net requirements developed for lower capability groups within an I&SG as
         a result of the asset alignment procedures will be transferred to, and consolidated with
         the I&S master computation group. Any gross requirements for a lower capability
         computation group which are not offset by reported assets will be consolidated with
         the I&S master gross requirements. All net requirements (including the dollar
         extensions) will therefore be shown in the I&S master computation group only.
      6.6.9.2. Description. This product allows the display of net requirements by location
      data. The display consists of a maximum of eight sections which depict gross
      requirements, aligned assets, and net requirements across eleven program positions. If
      more than one SGM is selected, the sequence will be ALC, DIV, IMS, I&S master NSN,
      followed by SGMs within the I&SG starting with the master and ending with the least
      preferred NSN.
         6.6.9.2.1. Any or all of the following may be viewed:
             6.6.9.2.1.1. Section 1: Contains net and gross requirements and aligned assets
             sequenced by SRAN and MAJCOM within SGM.
             6.6.9.2.1.2. Section 2: Contains net and gross requirements and aligned assets
             summarized at the SRAN level within SGM.
             6.6.9.2.1.3. Section 3: Contains net and gross requirements and aligned assets
             sequenced by MAJCOM and WRM base code within SGM.
             6.6.9.2.1.4. Section 4: Contains page for each SGM with WRM totals and shows
             gross, requirements, aligned assets, and net requirements.
             6.6.9.2.1.5. Section 5: Contains additive net and gross requirements, and aligned
             assets sequenced by MAJCOM within SGM.
             6.6.9.2.1.6. Section 6: Contains an additive requirements summary for the SGM.
             Additives come from Section 4 of RAR. WRM additives are not included here;
             they are included in Section 4, NRL.
             6.6.9.2.1.7. Section 7: Contains a MAJCOM summary SRAN, WRM base code,
             and additive data by SGM.
             6.6.9.2.1.8. Section 8: Contains summary totals for each SGM selected.
  6.6.10. Projected Requirements and Assets.
      6.6.10.1. Purpose. The PRA contains, on a single format, requirement and asset data,
      and item information required to assist in analyzing an item at equipment item reviews.
      6.6.10.2. General.
         6.6.10.2.1. The PRA is divided into four parts/screens: REQUIREMENTS,
         ASSETS, BUY NET REQUIREMENTS, and BUY NET RQMTS/ITEM INFO.
             6.6.10.2.1.1. The first two parts of the PRA show by individual computation
             group, projected summary REQUIREMENT and applied ASSET data for selected
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                      159


            quarters through a 7-year computational span. The data pertinent to the
            computation cutoff quarter are always indicated in the first position and may be
            the first, second, third, or fourth quarter of the cutoff year. All other positions are
            static throughout all computations for the FY being computed.
            6.6.10.2.1.2. The third part, the BUY/BUD REQUIREMENTS part, provides the
            dollar value of net requirements as the buy, budget, and subsequent to the fourth
            quarter positions through the last projected position.
            6.6.10.2.1.3. The fourth part, the BUY NET REQUIREMENTS/ITEM INFO part
            of the PRA, contains various data derived from the RAR, NRL and IMCD. It
            provides BUY NET REQUIREMENTS for the buy position, PREV COMP FOR
            SGM data, SGM LONG SUPPLY and ITEM INFORMATION data.
         6.6.10.2.2. Net requirements developed for lower capability groups within an I&SG
         as a result of the asset alignment procedures will be transferred to, and consolidated
         with the I&S master computation group. Any gross requirements for a lower
         capability computation group which are not offset by reported assets will be
         consolidated with the I&S master gross requirements. Therefore, all net requirements
         (including the dollar extensions) will be shown in the I&S master computation group
         only.
     6.6.10.3. Frequency. The PRA is produced each cycle (quarterly and updates) whenever
     a buy, budget, termination, or excess quantity greater than zero exists.
     6.6.10.4. Format Description. The first three parts of the PRA show summarized
     segmented requirements and asset data projected for selected quarters through a buy and
     six budget positions.
         6.6.10.4.1. Positions:
  6.6.10.4.1.1. Position 1 (RPT). This represents the ―as of date‖ of the computation. This
  position will show requirements and assets as reported prior to asset alignment as
  accomplished during the computation process
            6.6.10.4.1.2. Position 2 (CUR OP). This represents the fourth quarter of the
            procurement year being computed. It is from this point that procurement lead
            time is used to determine the buy and budget positions. At this position, the
            computation has aligned the assets as described in the 29 steps of para 6.5.2.
            6.6.10.4.1.3. Position 3 (BUY). This represents the buy position. It is a variable
            and will be determined by the procurement lead time file maintained on IMCD.
            6.6.10.4.1.4. Position 4 (BUD). This represents the budget position. It is a
            variable, and is determined by the procurement lead time file maintained on
            IMCD. Generally, it is 12 months beyond the buy position.
            6.6.10.4.1.5. Position 5. (BUD + 1). This represents the budget + 1 position. It
            is a variable. Generally, it is 12 months beyond the budget position.
            6.6.10.4.1.6. Position 6 (BUD + 2). This represents the budget + 2 positions. It
            is a variable. It is 12 months beyond the budget + 1 position.
            6.6.10.4.1.7. Position 7 (BUD + 3). This represents the budget + 3 positions. It
160                                                      AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011


         is a variable. It is 12 months beyond the budget + 2 positions.
         6.6.10.4.1.8. Position 8 (BUD + 4). This represents the budget + 4 positions. It
         is a variable. It is 12 months beyond the budget + 3 positions.
         6.6.10.4.1.9. Position 9 (BUD + 5). This represents the budget + 5 positions. It
         is variable. It is 12 months beyond the budget + 4 positions. The product is
         divided into parts (screens): requirements, assets, net accumulated requirements,
         and item information.
      6.6.10.4.2. Requirements: The following are displayed on the PRA:
         6.6.10.4.2.1. AF INITIAL. This line represents the total requirements reported
         from the AFEMS. This includes current SBSS EAID and forecast records.
         6.6.10.4.2.2. CAP. Unused.
         6.6.10.4.2.3. ANG INITIAL. This entry is the same as the AF initial line except
         that is contains only ANG requirements (command code 4Z).
         6.6.10.4.2.4. AFR INITIAL. This entry is the same as the AF initial line except
         that it contains only AFR requirements (command code 0M).
         6.6.10.4.2.5. WRM. This entry will contain all reported requirements from
         Section 3 RAR. WRM additives, TRC 1-9, will appear on the additive line.
         6.6.10.4.2.6. AF ADDITIVE. This entry will contain a total of all manually
         added requirements by the IMS for which procurement action might be required,
         and certain mechanically input additive requirements. When type requirements
         codes 16-19 and 50-92 are used, additive requirements will appear on this line
         (plus those for ANG and AFR).
         6.6.10.4.2.7. REPLACEMENT. This entry will contain all machine computed
         replacement quantities based on the use of a replacement factor, plus any type
         requirements code 10-15, 40, 41, and 93-99 additive requirements manually input
         to Section 4 RAR. Replacement factors are not used against WRM requirements;
         additive requirements with TRC 49; or for entries showing ASCs of 000, 014,
         040, 044, 047, 048, 049, 050, 052, 053, 054, 057, 058, 064, 068, 076, 985, 986,
         987, or STBY. Considering the exceptions above, the replacement quantity is
         mechanically computed and projected through the program positions by use of the
         following formula (see Segment 09): REPL QTY = REPL FACTOR X TIME
         FACTOR X SUM OF INSERVICE AND WAREHOUSE ASSETS APPLIED,
         REAPPLIED, AND ALLOCATED AT EACH PROGRAM POSITION.
         6.6.10.4.2.8. TOTALS. This entry shows the sum of the seven categories listed
         above for each program position.
      6.6.10.4.3. Assets. Assets are broken out to the following categories:
         6.6.10.4.3.1. IN USE. Program position one shows all assets reported in use
         from Sections 1 and 4 of the RAR. The quantities in program positions 2-9
         represent the total in use assets available to satisfy requirements. Assets returned
         to their home computation group from another and applied to a requirement will
         be on this line of data. Assets reported in use from another computation group
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                 161


          may be deleted starting in program position two. Note: A NSN detail of asset
          movements within the computation is reflected in the RAR, Section 7.
          6.6.10.4.3.2. IN PLACE. This entry shows all assets reported in place to offset
          WRM authorizations as reported in Section 3 of the RAR.
          6.6.10.4.3.3. WAREHOUSE SERVICEABLE.                  This entry is a constant
          throughout all program positions. It represents all serviceable assets not in use or
          in place at bases and ALCs as reported in Section 2 of the RAR. In transit assets
          in Section 2 of the RAR are also shown as warehouse serviceable.
          6.6.10.4.3.4. WAREHOUSE UNSERVICEABLE. This entry is a constant
          throughout all program positions. It represents the unserviceable (reparable)
          assets at bases or ALCs as reported in Section 2 of the RAR.
          6.6.10.4.3.5. FUNDED AND O/O. This entry includes all due-in assets as a
          result of PR, MIPR, contracts, reclamation, etc. Funded only assets must always
          be added by the IMS in Section 2 of the RAR. The entry is straight-lined
          throughout the computation time frame.
          6.6.10.4.3.6. TOTALS. This entry is the sum of in use + in place + warehouse
          serviceable + warehouse unserviceable + funded/on order. Program position one
          is the total of assets as reported at the cutoff date. Variations may be noted
          starting with program position 2 due to economic considerations built into the
          computation system.
       6.6.10.4.4. Net Requirements. Net requirements are computed for each program
       position by subtracting Total Assets from Total Requirements. Net requirements are
       broken out to ―initial‖ and ―replacement‖ requirements. Currently only appropriation
       3010 (BP10 and BP12) are being identified as initial/replacement.
          6.6.10.4.4.1. Initial Net Requirements. Initial Net Requirements are requirements
          for all MDSs supported which are listed in the IBM table. The actual
          mathematics is accomplished by individual MDS on the WSP. This line on the
          PRA displays the rolled up results from WS calculations. All additive
          requirements input to Section 4 of the RAR identified to TRC 1-9, 16-39, 42-65,
          and 67-92 for which the additive MDS matches an MDS in the IBM table are
          considered as initial requirements. The shortages are funded by individual
          System Program Office (SPO) using BP10 money.
          6.6.10.4.4.2. Replacement Net Requirements. Replacement Net Requirements
          are requirements for MDSs not listed in the IBM table. Again, the actual
          computation is accomplished on the WSP. This line on the PRA shows the
          summarized results. This line includes additive requirements identified to TRCs
          10-15, 40, 41, 93-99 for MDSs that are listed in the IBM table, and for all
          additives input for which MDSs are not listed in the IBM table. These
          requirements are funded using BP12 funds.
          6.6.10.4.4.3. The CSAG-M line was designed to accept the CSAG-M
          requirement in order to develop consolidated buys. At present, this concept is
          under review and is not used.

      6.6.10.4.5. Buy/Budget Requirements.
         6.6.10.4.5.1. Buy/budget requirements are shown for the buy and six different
         budget positions on the PRA, starting with the buy, then, budget, then the 4th
         quarter of each of the next five budget years thereafter. The quantities printed for
         the buy and budget positions will be the same as the net accumulated
         requirements, except the following:
             6.6.10.4.5.1.1. When the net accumulated requirements at the budget position
             are less than those at the buy position, the buy requirements are reduced to
             equal the budget quantity. ―ADJ‖ is printed next to the adjusted buy quantity
             when this occurs.
             6.6.10.4.5.1.2. The budget position quantity is determined by taking the net
             accumulated requirements at the budget, and subtracting the buy position
             quantity (adjusted or otherwise). The quantities printed for the remaining
             positions show the net requirements for these positions after finding the
             difference between them and their preceding positions.
         6.6.10.4.5.2. Under ―Unit Cost,‖ the following categories are displayed:
             6.6.10.4.5.2.1. PRICE W/O FDT. This represents the standard price (without
             the first destination transportation) multiplied by .970874 (or the standard
             price less 3%). This is an information entry.
             6.6.10.4.5.2.2. STANDARD PRICE. This is the cataloging price of the item
             obtained from D035 and is the price on IMCD, Section B. Projected costs are
             shown for the buy, budget, budget + 1 through budget + 5 positions.
             6.6.10.4.5.2.3. INITIAL SPARES. This is the cost of initial spares
             determined by multiplying the spares factor (from IMCD) times the standard
             price (from IMCD) times the net shortage, and with the result rounded to
             whole dollars.
             6.6.10.4.5.2.4. TECH DATA COST. This cost is a one-time cost for
             technical data, and is obtained from the IMCD. It is a total technical data cost
             -- not a unit cost.
             6.6.10.4.5.2.5. OTHER COST. This entry covers all other costs not shown
             above, and is a unit cost which must be expanded by net quantities computed
             to arrive at the total other cost. It is obtained from the IMCD.
             6.6.10.4.5.2.6. TOTAL WITH FDT. This is the sum of standard price, initial
             spares, tech data, and other cost. Extended cost entries are reflected for the
             same positions, and developed in the same manner as the standard price.
      6.6.10.4.6. Buy Net Requirements - Item Information. The data in Table 6.8. comes
      from the IMCD, the RAR, and the NRL.
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                163

         6.6.10.4.7. Changing Data on the PRA. There are two correct methods to change
         data on the PRA.
             6.6.10.4.7.1. By file maintaining the RAR during the file maintenance initial
             cycle, a corrected PRA will be produced on the 4U or 10U.
             6.6.10.4.7.2. If changes are required after the update cycle, file maintenance
             actions will be taken on the WSP file maintenance screens. WS file maintenance
             actions update not only the PRA, but also the IA, WSP, and IDSS records.
  6.6.11. Listings, Summaries, and Reports.
      6.6.11.1. General.   Listings will be produced for the AFMC equipment item
      requirements monitor. These listings will provide detail and summarized reports to
      enable the ALC manager and the IMS to determine the validity and accuracy of reported
      data. The products discussed in this section may be used as backup data to help in asset
      accounting.
      6.6.11.2. Equipment STK NO Change Listing.
         6.6.11.2.1. This hard copy report is automatically generated as a result of the
         quarterly batch validation process. It shows the NSNs which have been added,
         transferred, consolidated, or deleted since the last cutoff (AS OF) cycle. Old and new
         asset history data is listed by the new ALC Site ID, Div Desig IMS, and IMS (deletes
         go to the old ALC Site ID, Div Desig IMS, and IMS). The new Stk-Nr Act l is used
         to find the latest data in the Equipment Item Manager Control Data Store (3600).
         6.6.11.2.2. At the start of each quarter, all NSNs in the equipment database are
         matched to the latest catalog information in the RMS D200E that is identified as an
         equipment item. Any item that was in the D200E, but not in the equipment database,
         is added and is listed on this report.
         6.6.11.2.3. The following may also be listed on the report:
             6.6.11.2.3.1. Deletions - NSNs that were on the previous cycle, but not in the
             current D200E.
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                    165


            6.6.11.2.3.2. Transfers - Those items with a phrase code ―E‖ (replaced by NSN)
            assigned to a series of phrases to denote changes/or relationships between NSNs
            and information type data.
            6.6.11.2.3.3. Consolidations - Those items with a phrase code equal to ―A‖
            (consolidate with NSN) or ―C‖ (canceled/replaced by NSN). Note: A complete
            list of phrase codes is contained in AFMAN 23-110, V1, P4, C1 Attachment 1A-
            49                                 (at                         http://www.e-

            pdf).
        6.6.11.2.4. If more than 30 subgroups exist, the 29 least preferred SGMs remain the
        same. All more preferred items/SGMs are grouped into the same SGM.
     6.6.11.3. Asset Reconciliation List for Equipment Items.
        6.6.11.3.1. This list is automatically generated during the semiannual update cycle
        (product number C7ECD8H4), and during the quarterly update cycle (product
        number C7EC68H4). It tabulates the NSNs for which a worksheet is produced. The
        list also presents Variance, Variance Cost, SGM Buy, SGM Budget, and SGM
        Termination values for each listed NSN. This list is sequenced by ALC, DIV, IMS,
        I&S stock number, and actual NSN sequence.
        6.6.11.3.2. Asset reconciliation lists are ―pushed‖ for NSNs meeting the following
        criteria:
            6.6.11.3.2.1. NSN is in a computed buy, budget, or termination status, and NSN
            has an extended dollar value of at least $100,000 (semiannual update).
            6.6.11.3.2.2. There is a difference between total assets acquired and total on-hand
            assets plus known losses, for NSNs with a unit cost of at least $300,000 and/or
            total inventory of at least $10,000,000 (quarterly update).
        6.6.11.3.3. Purpose. These products are guides for identifying equipment items that
        need further review and/or action. The IA summarizes the results of the equipment
        item computation cycles. There are four basic IAs that can be obtained from the
        RMS: Basic, Descending Dollar sequence, SGM within I&S sequence, and SGM
        sequence. The IA can be obtained in a variety of ways: push product (hardcopy),
        display, or report (hardcopy).
     6.6.11.4. The 405 SCMS/GULA uses the Basic Index of Actions, available inventory
     values, current backorders, and the number of ERRC ―S‖ unserviceable assets needing
     repair to prioritize the list of NSNs for review and file maintenance. This prioritized list
     can be found in the Quality Checker Tool posted periodically to the Support Equipment
     Policy                  and                Procedures               CoP                  (at
     https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=OO-RQ-MC-16). In
     addition to prioritizing the NSNs, the Quality Checker Tool checks for a number of
     inconsistent data elements and includes error messages indicating some pre-identified
     corrective actions that are needed. It is mandatory to follow the Quality Checker Tool
     work sequence.

      6.6.11.4.1. Terminations, not yet worked and coded, will be given the highest NSN
      weight. SGMs with terminations will be worked first, beginning with the highest
      dollar value. After deciding whether to terminate or not terminate, access Section A
      Continued, IMCD, and enter the appropriate code in the Termination CD Field. See
      Chapter 8 for file maintenance instructions. Termination candidates will be checked
      at once for feasibility of contract/PR/MIPR termination, and appropriate action taken.
      6.6.11.4.2. Shortages, the sum of the buy, budget, and budget+1 net requirements
      will be weighted above those computing excess and retention during the Mar and Sep
      comp cycles.
      6.6.11.4.3. Long Supply, the sum of excess and retention, will be weighted above
      those computing a buy, budget, or budget+1 net requirements during the Jun and Dec
      comp cycles.
      6.6.11.4.4. Besides weighting the Net Requirements from the Index of Actions, the
      Quality Checker Tool assigns a weight-to-error message found, the available
      inventory value, the backorder value (quantity backordered times standard price), and
      the requirement value that can be satisfied with the repair of ERRC ―S‖ unserviceable
      assets..

       ITEM & DOLLAR SUMMARY STRATIFICATION (IDSS), MATERIEL
      PROCUREMENT PROGRAM CONTROL (MPPC) & OTHER PRODUCTS

7.1. Item & Dollar Summary Stratification (IDSS).
   7.1.1. Purpose. To provide requirements and asset data, expressed in terms of dollar value,
   by various indentures of funds control to effect improved supply management of logistic
   operations; to evaluate effectiveness of past actions; and to measure progress toward
   requirement objectives.
   7.1.2. Frequency. The IDSS is available for each computation cycle for each computation
   group in the system reflecting requirements and/or assets. Quantities and dollars are shown
   if SGM is entered. For other selections, ALC, DIV, IMS, FSC, MMAC, BP, SMC, MPC or
   lead time, dollar summaries are displayed or printed.
   7.1.3. Description. Gross requirements, aligned assets, net requirements and long supply
   assets can be viewed or printed. Selection is by various combinations of SGM, ALC, DIV,
   IMS, FSC, FSG, MMAC, section, BP, SMC, MPC, lead time and price escalation. When
   price escalation is selected, all dollar values are escalated to the displayed year. If a SGM is
   entered, dollar values and quantities are displayed, otherwise, only a dollar summary is
   displayed. Whether a request is by SGM or by various combinations involving more than
   one SGM, four sections can be viewed and they are listed as follows:
      7.1.3.1. Section 1 - Gross Requirements, Aligned Assets, and Buy/Budget
      Requirements/Assets (GROSS/ALIGNED/BUY/BUD ASSETS). This section shows the
      gross requirements and aligned assets at the Reported, Current Operating, Buy, and
      Budget positions. If a SGM is entered, dollar values and quantities are produced. When
      a BP is entered, only a dollar summary is produced.
          7.1.3.1.1. The gross requirements are stratified across the four program positions.
          However, at the reported position, WRM, O/S, Z/I, and additives break out the gross
          requirements.
          7.1.3.1.2. The asset data is stratified across the four positions by In-Service (IN
          SVC), Warehouse Serviceable (WHS SVC), Warehouse Unserviceable (WHS USV),
          Funded On/Order (FND O/O), and Total Assets (TOT AST). At the reported
          position, each asset category is further broken out. In-service assets include
          categories I/P, O/S, and Z/I. Categories O/S, Z/I, and depot break out warehouse
          serviceable and unserviceable assets. There is no breakout for total assets in the
          reported position.
          7.1.3.1.3. The net requirements and adjusted buy/budget requirements stratify their
          requirement data by initial and replacement. Note: These requirements are not
          shown at the reported positions because this position is not computed. The adjusted
          requirements are derived from the net requirements. The adjusted buy quantity is
          replaced by the budget quantity if the budget quantity is less. The adjusted budget
          quantity is the increase of the budget quantity over the buy quantity.

       7.1.3.2. Section 2 – Buy Segmented Requirements, Budget Segmented Requirements
       (BUY/BUD SEGMENTED RQMTS).
          7.1.3.2.1. This display/report reflects the IDSS Section 2 Buy/Bud Segmented
          Requirements data for the selected SGMs. It stratifies AF initial, AFR, ANG, WRM,
          replacement, and additive requirements. It also includes aligned assets, net
          requirements, and net AFR and ANG replacement quantities.
          7.1.3.2.2. The AFR data relates exclusively to data with the two-position MAJCOM
          code of 0M, and ANG data corresponds to the 4Z MAJCOM code.
       7.1.3.3. Section 3 - Long Supply.
          7.1.3.3.1. This display/report shows Item and Dollar Stratification Section 3, long
          supply data by SGMs. The long supply (computed excess assets) is divided into
          suitable excess (economic retention) and unsuitable excess (contingency retention).
          The unsuitable is the unsuitable excess NSNs (parts preference 4 and 9) in the
          computation.
          7.1.3.3.2. Each category is further divided into directed to hold (DIR/HLD), elected
          to hold (ELE/ HLD), or excess. Assets are included in DIR/HOLD if the DDC is
          other than ―N‖ or blank, or if there is a directed to hold additive in Section 4 of the
          RAR. Assets are included in ELE/HLD if there is an elected to hold additive and/or a
          computed elected to hold quantity and the assets are not already in directed to hold.
          Any excess assets remaining are shown as excess. The total gross requirement line is
          the total of the additive directed to hold for the DIR/HLD part. For the elected to
          hold, it is the sum of the additive elected to hold plus the computed elected to hold
          which is the difference between the highest gross requirement and the gross
          requirement at the higher of the buy or budget position.
       7.1.3.4. Section 4 - SGM Totals. This section shows the SGM Totals data for the
       selected SGMs.
          7.1.3.4.1. The top portion of this section provides the total number of SGM numbers
          and the total NSN count. A quantity in the SGM count indicates how many SGMs
          are in termination, have net requirements in the buy, budget, or budget +1 position,
          and contain retention or excess. The NSN count is the number of NSNs for the
          SGMs in the selection.
          7.1.3.4.2. The bottom portion of the section provides visibility of computed elected
          to hold quantity; AF elected to hold (ELE/HLD) quantity; and contractor
          requirements. The computed elected to hold quantity is the highest gross requirement
          less the gross requirement at the higher of the buy or budget position. The AF
          ELE/HLD is the sum of the elected to hold additives. The contractor requirement is
          sum of the additives identified with TRCs 60-69.
7.2. Materiel Procurement Program Control (MPPC).
   7.2.1. Purpose. To provide listings and data for items with a firm net requirement at the buy
   and budget positions, identified to a BP and segregated by dollar value.
   7.2.2. Frequency. These reports/displays are available after each computation cycle.
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                    169


   7.2.3. Description. The MPPC provides buy, budget, and budget +1 adjusted net
   requirement quantities and dollars.
       7.2.3.1. The Selection Screen allows the selection of the MPPC by various combinations
       of ALC, DIV, IMS, BP, SMC, range and cost range categories: U (upper), M (middle),
       and L (lower). Each range category has a default dollar value that can be changed.
       Range categories and BP must be selected. The Escalation Price option provides dollar
       results escalated to the buy, budget, and budget +1 year.
       7.2.3.2. MPPC Dollar Range. This report displays MPPC plan dollar range data by SGM
       that meet the selection criteria. If range category ―U‖ is entered, the report selects all
       requirements over the upper range (default - $900,000) and produces a report with one
       SGM on a page. If range category ―M‖ is entered, the report selects all requirements
       within the dollar range (default = $100,000 - $900,000) and prints up to two SGMs per
       page (page break for BP or BPAC, and IM MPC). The total costs are printed only on the
       last page. Data is reported by descending dollar value on budget adjusted net
       requirements costs, budget +1 adjusted net requirements cost, and buy adjusted net
       requirements cost.
       7.2.3.3. MPPC Minor Replacement Items.         This report displays MPPC minor
       replacement items under the dollar range selected (default = $100,000). The report
       contains as many FSC/MMACs as possible per page (page break for BP or BPAC, and
       IM MPC). The total costs (including total ANG/AFR) are reported only on the last page.
           7.2.3.3.1. This display/report shows MPPC minor replacement items under the dollar
           range selected. The report contains as many FSC/MMACs as possible per page (page
           break for BP or BPAC, and IM MPC). The total costs (including total ANG/AFR)
           are reported only on the last page. To adjust values, use IMCD Section A Continued,
           IMCD Section B (for standard price), and/or WS data.

way for the IMS to record comments about the item. Note: Users must enter comments on
Notepad to save changes in the data base.
7.5. Repair Index of Actions (RIA). This report is a listing of the computed depot repair
requirements by actual NSN. The user will select valid combinations of selection criteria as
explained below. The report will be sequenced by descending repair cost (repair cost is standard
price x repair quantity). Note: The repair quantity listed here may not be the same as what is
currently sent to the repair system. The RIA is computed using the RMS algorithm while the
repair quantity sent to the repair system is computed by D039 using only the repair rate.
7.6. NSN SRAN Variances (NSV). This report provides a comparison by SRAN of reported
assets in the current cycle to those in the previous March update cycle. Only those SRANs

within the NSN selected, which have a variance, are reported. This hard copy report can be
produced as requested by the user.
7.7. Stock Number Variance (SNV). The Equipment Asset Variance Report by actual NSN is
a comparison of reported assets in the current cycle to those in the previous March update. Only
those NSNs with an asset variance are extracted. The report lists standard price, total assets
available, lost, and total for the previous March cycle; available, lost, and total for the current
cycle; dollar variances (mathematical difference from previous March to current cycle), variance
percent, and variance cost for each actual NSN. The report is produced in descending variance
sequence.

                     TERMINATION AND REDUCTION OF ASSETS

8.1. Termination and Reduction of Assets. All equipment inventory is required to be applied
against an authorization. A method to reduce excess assets and prevent excess assets from
entering the inventory is necessary due to fluid changes in the force structure and authorizations.
8.2. Termination of Assets. Termination levels are computed in D200C at the budget + 1
program position. Any contract or PR which would increase inventory beyond that level will
show up on the IA as a termination. The IMS must perform file maintenance actions in D200C
on every item in termination within 10 working days of the computation becoming available
(reference DoD 4140.1-R, DoD Supply Chain Materiel Management Regulation, para. C3.7.1.2.
at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/414001r.pdf). Items can be file maintained
out of termination and/or coded with the appropriate termination code. All ALCs are required to
provide the 405 SCMS/GULA with a quarterly Termination Report and all appropriate
information.
   8.2.1. File Maintaining Terminations.
       8.2.1.1. File maintenance will be done if there are changes in authorizations, assets, or
       errors in due-in data. This can be done in the RAR for the ―as of 31 March‖ and ―as of
       30 September‖ cycles, or in the WSP for any cycle (see Chapter 5 for RAR and Chapter
       11 for the WSP).
       8.2.1.2. Any item remaining in termination needs to have a termination code applied by
       file maintaining the IMCD, Section A Continued (see Chapter 3). Some termination
       codes require that supporting information be supplied to the 405 SCMS/GULA with the
       ALC Termination Report.
       8.2.1.3. Termination Documentation: Documentation is required on all items coded for
       termination. This information will be annotated on the Notepad, and include the code
       and other pertinent data as stated within the list of termination codes.
   8.2.2. Termination Codes and their definitions to be file maintained in IMCD, section A,
   Continued, can be found in Table 13.20
   8.2.3. Termination of Contracts. Contracts and PRs will be canceled or reduced if at all
   possible, even if cancellation costs are incurred. Use ALC established procedures for
   cancellation or reduction of contracts and PRs.
   8.2.4. Reporting of Terminations. The 405 SCMS/GULA will be responsible for compiling
   a termination report by ALC and total AF, and providing the report to HQ USAF/A4LE.
   Format to be used can be found in Figure 8.1.
8.3. Reduction of Assets. All in-store and in-use assets which are not applied against
authorization at the highest program position are subject to reduction actions. The IM will make
every effort to dispose of excess equipment using locally established ALC procedures.

                      RECONCILING EQUIPMENT ITEM ASSETS

9.1. HQ AFMC Equipment Item Asset Reconciliation Policy.
   9.1.1. It is necessary that all acquired assets be accounted for from the time they are brought
   into the AF inventory until they are disposed. Reference DOD 4000.25-2-M, Military
   Standard Transaction Reporting and Accounting Procedures (MILSTRAP),Chapter 7 (at
   http://www.dla.mil/j-6/dlmso/eLibrary/Manuals/MILSTRAP/default.asp) and DOD
   4140.1-R (at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/414001r.pdf).
   9.1.2. Requirements personnel must reconcile assets:
      9.1.2.1. Quarterly for classified equipment items that have a variance greater than zero.
      Security codes that identify classified items can be found in the D043 cataloging data and
      are A-H, K, L, S, and T. Reference AFMAN 23-110, V3, P2, C21, Table 21A8.1. for
      codes              and               definitions             (at            http://www.e-
      publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/PUBS/AF/23/23011003/030221/030221.pdf).
      A WW inventory must be accomplished if the classified item’s variance remains after the
      research and corrections by the IMS.
      9.1.2.2. Semiannually for:
          9.1.2.2.1. Equipment items that have an extended dollar value of $100,000 or more
          and are in a buy, budget, or termination status. The 31 March and 30 September
          update cycles (4U and 10U) must be used when reconciling these items.
          9.1.2.2.2. All NWRM assets on supply accountable records must be inventoried.
          Reference AFI 20-110, Nuclear Weapons-Related Materiel Management, para 8.1. (at
          http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFI20-110.pdf).      A WW
          inventory must be accomplished if the NWRM’s variance remains after the IMS
          researches and corrects. For NWRM assets managed in CAS, the asset reconciliation
          procedures in this instruction are in addition to requirements in AFI 21-201,
          Conventional Munitions Maintenance Management, and/or AFI 21-203, Nuclear
          Accountability Procedures.
      9.1.2.3. Annually for equipment items that have a variance between the total assets
      acquired and the total of the on-hand assets plus the known losses with a unit cost of
      $300,000 or more and/or a total inventory value of $10 million or more.
   9.1.3. To assist in the reconciliation process, a mechanized Asset Reconciliation Worksheet
   for Equipment Items - Format 305 (see para 9.2) is produced semiannually and quarterly for
   selected items based on the criteria in paras 9.1.2.2 and 9.1.2.3 This worksheet will reflect
   the total assets acquired by the AF and the total on-hand assets and losses as reported by the
   C001 system. In addition, there is an ad hoc capability that can be used to request a Format
   305 for any equipment item, regardless of the above criteria (see para 9.3). (Note: The
   security code is not visible in D039/D200C, so products will not be pushed based on the
   Security Code. However, the Asset Reconciliation Tool, posted to the Support Equipment
   Community of Practice (CoP0 by the 405 SCMS/GULA, will provide the list of NSNs
 174                                                            AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011


   applicable to para 9.1.2.1 IMS will need to request the ad hoc Asset Reconciliation
   worksheet for NSNs that did not receive a pushed product.)
       9.1.3.1. Assets acquired by the AF must be file maintained into Section C of the IMCD
       product in order for this information to be forwarded to the Format 305 for reconciliation
       purposes. The IMS must update the IMS Total Acquired Field whenever new
       acquisitions are delivered. This information must come from procurement history
       records and/or other documented sources. If IMS cannot find documentation for all of
       the reported assets or knows some assets were provisioned by a System Program Office,
       research must be conducted, inventories tracked and re-base-lined, the AFMC Form 318
       documented, and the re-base-lined quantity file maintained in IMCD, section C. See
       para 9.2.4 for more information regarding the research required to work the variances.
       Note: If this is not the correct baseline figure, it will also be changed.
       9.1.3.2. The reconciliation process must consist of comparing total procured assets
       against all on-hand assets and losses. If this comparison reveals unaccounted for assets,
       research must be accomplished in an effort to determine what happened to the
       unaccounted-for assets. All unaccountable assets must have historical and pertinent
       information recorded to support the item’s status. This information must be clear and
       substantially detailed to withstand a review or audit.
       9.1.3.3. A review of the mechanized Format 305 by ALC management is required for
       each of the selected items. The VARIANCE COST portion of block 3 on the Format 305
       (see para 9.2.4.2 below) is the dollar value to be used in determining the required
       signature level.
   9.1.4. The Format 305 is the preferred form to be used in reconciling equipment items.
   However, under approval from the 405 SCMS/GULA, a supplement sheet may be used as
   necessary.
   9.1.5. The two most recent Formats 305 must be retained for historical/audit purposes.
   9.1.6. An Asset Reconciliation List for Equipment Items is produced quarterly and
   semiannually for each ALC based on the criteria in para 9.1.2 This report lists all equipment
   items (I&S and Actual NSNs) for which a Format 305 was produced (see para 9.4). If the
   NWRM and/or classified items do not fall within the dollar value criteria, a hard copy Format
   305 will not be automatically pushed to the IMS. Consequently, the IMS will request a
   mechanized Format 305 through the output products.
   9.1.7. Asset reconciliation must be closely monitored to ensure the accuracy and integrity of
   the equipment item requirements computation.
9.2. Asset Reconciliation Worksheet for Equipment Items - Format 305 (Fig 9. 1). The
Format 305 is automatically produced semiannually and quarterly for selected items based on the
criteria in para 9.1.2 This worksheet is required in reconciling assets and reflects the total assets
acquired by the AF and the total on-hand assets and losses as reported by the C001 system.
There is also an ad hoc capability that requirements personnel can use to request a worksheet for
any equipment item, regardless of the above criteria (see para 9.3).

  9.2.2. Block 1, TOTAL ACQUIRED - IMS. This field represents all assets acquired. This
  entry is obtained from Section C of the IMCD. Using procurement history records and/or
  other documented sources, assets acquired by the AF are to be file maintained into the ―IMS
  TOT ACQUIRED‖ column in Section C of the IMCD product. Document the source of this
  information in Block 6, REMARKS.
  9.2.3. Block 2, TOTAL ACQUIRED-COMP. This field represents all acquired assets plus
  losses that have been reported by the C001 system. This entry is obtained from Section C of
  the IMCD.
  9.2.4. Block 3:
     9.2.4.1. VARIANCE (1 - 2). This field represents the difference between Block 1
     (TOTAL ACQUIRED - IMS) and Block 2 (TOTAL ACQUIRED-COMP).
         9.2.4.1.1. A zero indicates that the total assets acquired by the AF equal the sum of
         the total on-hand assets and losses as reported by C001.
         9.2.4.1.2. A positive number indicates that the total quantity of assets acquired is
         greater than the sum of the C001 reported on-hand assets and losses.
         9.2.4.1.3. A negative number indicates that the total quantity of assets acquired is
         less than the sum of the C001 reported on-hand assets and losses.
         9.2.4.1.4. If the quantity in Block 3 (VARIANCE) results in a positive or negative
         number, research must be accomplished in an effort to account for these assets. The
         portion of the variance quantity that can be explained must be manually annotated as
         being an accountable variance. The portion of the variance quantity that cannot be
         explained must be manually annotated as an unaccountable variance and Chapter 7 of
         DOD 7000.14-R, Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation (FMRS),
         Volume 12, Chapter 7, "Financial Liability for Government Property Lost, Damaged,
         Destroyed, or Stolen, (at http://comptroller.defense.gov/fmr/12/12_07.pdf) defines
         the criteria for requiring and performing a Report of Survey (ROS) investigation
         based on the type and dollar value of the materiel.. Historical information and
         pertinent factors to support this NSN’s status must be documented in Block 6,
         REMARKS. This documentation must be clear and substantially detailed to
         withstand a review or audit.
         9.2.4.1.5. Preceding the next computation cycle, if it is determined that the losses are
         in error, the loss fields in Section C of the IMCD must be adjusted. If the Total

         Acquired field is wrong, then the IMS Total Acquired field must be adjusted. If
         assets have not been reported, they can be put in as additives in Section 4 of the RAR
         or the reporting organizations can be contacted and instructed to correct their
         reporting. This file maintenance action will establish a reconciled baseline and
         prevent a repetitious research process every cycle.               (Caution:     Additive
         assets/authorizations must not duplicate other requirements in the computation.
         Additives that are input as a result of failures in the C001 interface have an extremely
         high risk of being duplicated in subsequent computation cycles.)
         9.2.4.1.6. Research of Reported Asset Data. Research of item history records must
         be conducted whenever there is a variance between the system total acquired assets
         and the IMS total acquired assets. The following are some suggestions, which might
         assist in the research effort:
            9.2.4.1.6.1. D035A Weekly Transaction Register (A-D035A.-111-W2-GTR). If
            there is any action at a depot (shipment/receipt of assets, requisition placed on
            back order, etc.) on the NSN, it will appear on this product. Immediately below
            the last transaction, there will be asset balance broken out by condition codes.
            This information can be used to validate depot balances and asset shipments
            reporting in AFEMS. The Defense Standard System (DSS) provides another
            source to research requisitions and shipment/receipts. The Reportable Asset
            Management Process System (RAMPS) also has a record of shipments.
            9.2.4.1.6.2. Non-reported Repair Assets. All assets currently being repaired at
            non-reporting interservice or contractor repair facilities must be file maintained
            into D200C.
            9.2.4.1.6.3. The government and commercial carriers also have other tools
            available for tracing shipments that the IMS must utilize.
            9.2.4.1.6.4. If the IMS cannot determine from their research why there is a
            variance, the IMS must consider requesting a WW inventory. For classified items
            and NWRM items, the IMS will request a WW inventory. Inventory adjustments
            for NWRM items will not be performed without documented asset reconciliation
            actions that must include a WW inventory and a minimum of a general officer or
            Senior Executive Service (SES) signature approval IAW AFI 20-110, Chapter 8
            (at:       http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFI20-110.pdf).
            After at least three consecutive quarters since the initial discovery, the adjustment
            may occur.
      9.2.4.2. VARIANCE COST. This field represents the absolute dollar value of the
      variance quantity in Block 3 (VARIANCE (1-2), and is computed by multiplying the
      absolute value of the variance quantity by the item’s standard unit price.
  9.2.5. Block 3A, ACCOUNTABLE. This field represents the portion of the variance in
  Block 3 that can be explained. This entry must be entered manually onto the Format 305 by
  requirements personnel.
  9.2.6. Block 3B, UNACCOUNTABLE. This field represents the portion of the variance in
  Block 3 that cannot be explained. This entry must be entered manually onto the Format 305
  by requirements personnel.

  9.2.7. Block 4, TOTAL AVAILABLE - COMP. This entry is a system generated total of
  inservice assets, warehouse serviceable assets, warehouse unserviceable assets, and TOC
  assets. If the system generated total is in error and requires correction, an inventory
  management adjustment column is provided for the IMS to manually enter the correct total.
  Entries in this block must have clear and documented source data annotated in Block 6,
  REMARKS.
  9.2.8. Block 5, LOSSES - COMP.
     9.2.8.1. This block represents various computer entries of assets lost to the inventory.
     The losses will be from the following categories:
         9.2.8.1.1. SAP - Quantity lost from the inventory to the SAP;
         9.2.8.1.2. NON-RPT ACTIVITIES - Quantity lost from the inventory to non-
         reporting government activities;
         9.2.8.1.3. INSTALLATIONS - Quantity lost from the inventory as a result of
         installations;
         9.2.8.1.4. MODIFICATIONS - Quantity lost from the inventory as a result of
         modifications;
         9.2.8.1.5. CONDEMNATIONS - Quantity lost from the inventory as a result of
         condemnations;
         9.2.8.1.6. DRMO - Quantity lost from the inventory to the DRMO; and
         9.2.8.1.7. OTHER - Quantity lost from the inventory that is not applicable to the first
         six categories. Examples of this category include inventory adjustments, re-identified
         losses, in transit losses, and combat disaster losses. Indicate in Block 6, REMARKS,
         the type of losses and the source data.
         9.2.8.1.8. TOTAL. This system-generated entry is the total quantity of assets lost
         from the inventory. It is the result of summing up the computer entries discussed in
         para 9.2.8
     9.2.8.2. If any of the computer entries in para 9.2.8.1 are in error and need to be
     corrected, an inventory management adjustment column is provided for the IMS to
     manually enter one or more adjustments. Any entries in this column must have clear and
     documented source data listed in Block 6, REMARKS.
     9.2.8.3. Preceding the next computation cycle, any corrections needed to these entries
     must be file maintained into the appropriate data fields of Section C of the IMCD. This
     file maintenance will establish a reconciled baseline and prevent a repetitious correction
     process every cycle.
  9.2.9. Block 6, REMARKS. This block must be used by the IMS to document all
  adjustments made to the preceding fields. Entries in this block must substantiate data entered
  into the preceding blocks (including all pertinent information considered necessary to
  validate all entries on this worksheet). Documentation must be clear and detailed to
  withstand a review or audit. If more space is required, the back may be used or additional
  pages may be attached. However, when attaching additional pages make sure to annotate the
 180                                                           AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011


   SGM NSN, I&S NSN, NSN, current date, and ―As Of‖ date, to decrease the risk of pages
   being lost.
   9.2.10. Block 7, SIGNATURE OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL AND DATE. This block must
   contain the required management signature level in accordance with Attachment 5 and the
   date the Format 305 was signed. The dollar value to be used in determining the required
   signature level must be the VARIANCE COST portion of Block 3.
9.3. Asset Reconciliation Product Selection Screen. As stated in para 9.1.3 , mechanized
asset reconciliation worksheets (Formats 305) are automatically produced for items that meet the
selection criteria in para 9.1.2 In the event requirements personnel want to perform asset
reconciliation for any item, regardless if the item meets the semiannual or quarterly selection
criteria, Formats 305 can be produced utilizing the Product Selection Screen.
   9.3.1. PRODUCT SELECTION DATA provides various input data fields to filter the
   selection. In order to receive asset reconciliation worksheets for any given item(s), data must
   be entered into one or more of the data elements. Table 9.2. discusses the various elements.

                                          Chapter 10

THE STRATIFICATION REPORT OF PRINCIPAL AND SECONDARY ITEMS, RCS:
                         DD-P&L (A) 1000

10.1. General. The National Security Act of 1947 requires the OSD to report annually to the
President and Congress on the quantity and dollar values of major equipment items of the
Military Departments. DoD 4140.1-R, DOD Supply Chain Materiel Management Regulation,
para C9.2, (at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/414001r.pdf) provides the
implementing instructions, and directs each DoD component to report annually the status of
principal items (equipment, uninstalled engines, and conventional ammunition), and secondary
items (stored supplies). The ALCs and AF Stock Fund Division managers provide input to the
Stratification Report of Principal and Secondary Items, RCS: DD-P&L (A) 1000, hereafter called
the DD1000 Report. This report contains the total dollar value of the inventory for principal and
secondary items, and their variances from past to current year. Portions of the DD1000 Report
become part of the OSD’s Supply System Inventory Report (SSIR). This section details the
equipment principal item portion of the annual DD1000 report. The 405 SCMS/GULA submits
the command level analysis and narrative. Much of the data used comes from analyses provided
by the ALCs. Each ALC is to consider its input to this report as part of its normal annual
workload.
   10.1.1. When the data in the equipment computation is current, accurate, and complete, the
   budgeting/funding requirements reported on the DD1000 Report will closely coincide with
   budgeting/funding requirements resulting from the annual HQ AFMC/USAF Buy/Budget
   Reviews. This enhances the credibility of the ALC budget submissions, and can be a factor
   affecting the level of funding received in the future.
   10.1.2. The DD-1000 report, accomplished annually, analyzes data from two computation
   cycles, 12 months apart. Currently, equipment (or principal) items are analyzed using the
   September computation cycles. The dollar value of the AF WW requirement and inventory
   information is analyzed by BP for the selected cycles and variances are computed for SGM
   categories.
   10.1.3. A thorough narrative analysis by NSN is required for equipment items. Narratives
   will include NSN, BP, quantity, dollar value, noun, applicable WS (if possible), and a
   complete analysis that explains why the variance occurred. Errors are not reported in the
   narrative analysis. The item managers must address and correct all errors through file
   maintenance prior to or during the narrative analysis process. References to errors in the
   analysis are not acceptable unless there were errors in last year’s data that escaped notice.
   10.1.4. Dollar values used in the DD-1000 report come from the IPI RMS on-line product;
   the IPI dollar value is in thousands of dollars. This report is formatted in the same manner
   as the DD Form 1138-1 which becomes a part of the published DD-1000 report. Often the
   IMS is not familiar with the requirement and inventory dollar value and finds it hard to use
   the IPI. The RMS on-line IDSS report is a source for the applicable dollar value and quantity
   for each IPI category. RMS computational products the IMS may need to use in the analysis
   of the variance are the PRA report, the WSP report, the IMCD report, the RAR report, and
   the Notepad (NP).
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                  185


  10.1.5. Besides the computational products, IMSs are often required to research the D035,
  J041, and the AFMC Form 318. Further, during the research/analysis process, the IMS may
  contact the ES, SM or LM, AS monitor, warehouse storage workers, users in the field, and/or
  major CEMO personnel.
  10.1.6. The 405 SCMS/GULA provides each ALC a list of NSNs with significant plus or
  minus dollar variances from the previous year for the ALC to analyze. The list contains
  NSNs from each BP and variance category. Each ALC’s report to 405 SCMS/GULA will
  contain an analysis of the variance for each listed NSN, and an overall analysis of the major
  variance trends associated with that ALC.
  10.1.7. The DD1000 Report consolidates DD Forms 1138-1 for the major BPs applicable to
  Equipment (BP10/12/20/22/35/82/83/84). Dollar values used on these forms come from the
  IPI, IV, and IDSS, RMS on-line products. Each DD Form 1138-1 includes a narrative
  portion explaining by NSN the main reasons current FY figures have increased or decreased
  by more than $5M from the previous year.
     10.1.7.1. The DD1000 reports and explains variances in the four following categories by
     BP. There can be NSNs identified that require narratives of variances in all four
     categories.
         10.1.7.1.1. Approved Force Acquisition Objective (AFAO). The AFAO Gross
         Requirement represents the dollar value of the budget position reflected on the IDSS
         product, Aligned Assets (Section 1). The gross requirements include the AF initial,
         ANG initial, AFR initial, WRM, Replacements (REPL), and Additives (ADD) in the
         applicable PRA program position.
         10.1.7.1.2. AFAO in Store Assets. The AFAO In-Store Assets represent the dollar
         value of the warehouse assets (serviceable and unserviceable) required to satisfy the
         AFAO requirement. The applicable dollar value in the IDSS product, Aligned Assets
         (Section 1) is the sum of the warehouse serviceable (WHS SVC) and warehouse
         unserviceable (WHS USV) fields in the same program positions as the AFAO
         requirement. The applicable quantity may (or may not) be reflected in the same PRA
         program positions, because the PRA reflects all warehouse assets. The IDSS,
         Aligned Assets (Section 1) only reflects the portion required to satisfy the AFAO
         requirement.
         10.1.7.1.3. Economic Retention In-Store Assets. The Economic Retention In-Store
         Assets represent the dollar value of the warehouse assets (serviceable and
         unserviceable) in the IDSS product Long Supply (Section 3). This category is the
         sum of four SUITABLE LONG SUPPLY fields on this product: Directed to Hold
         (DIR/HLD) WHS SVC; Elected to Hold (ELE/HLD) WHS SVC; DIR/HLD WHS
         USV; and ELE/HLD WHS USV. There is not a corresponding PRA field.
         10.1.7.1.4. Potential DoD Excess in Store Assets. The Potential DoD Excess In-
         Store Assets represent the dollar value of the warehouse assets (serviceable and
         unserviceable) in the IDSS product, Long Supply (Section 3). This category is the
         sum of the EXCESS WHS SVC; and EXCESS WHS USV fields from both the
         SUITABLE LONG SUPPLY and UNSUITABLE LONG SUPPLY. There is not a
         corresponding PRA field.

10.2. IPI, IV, and IDSS RMS on-line products required for the preparation of the DD1000
Report.
   10.2.1. Inventory of Principal Items (IPI). These RMS on-line products are used for the
   preparation of the DD Form 1138-1 information and narratives that are required for the
   annual submission of the DD1000 Report. The user will select reports by SGM or BP, or a
   combination of two or more BPs for AFMC totals or by each ALC. If desired, up to four IM
   DIVs of four IMS within an ALC can be reported.
       10.2.1.1. The IPI supplies the following dollar value data used in the DD1000 Report:
       Requirements – AFAO and WRM; and Assets (In-Use and In-Store) – AFAO, WRM,
       Economic Retention, and Potential DoD Excess. It also provides the total NSN counts
       used.
       10.2.1.2. This report can be requested at any time for all summary levels. Five years of
       data are available by quarter.
   10.2.2. Inventory Variance (IV). IV products report an inventory variance by SGM or by
   BP. The BP report can be further broken out by variance category. If a quarterly cycle is not
   assigned, the data shown is a comparison of the current March update and the previous
   March update cycles. These RMS on-line products are used in preparation of the DD1000
   Report to identify the variances requiring narration and the specific NSNs driving those
   variances.
       10.2.2.1. IV by SGM variance. This shows the NSNs that need to be analyzed to explain
       the dollar fluctuations on the IPI (DD1000) report. It can be used to analyze the same
       categories totaled on the IPI.
       10.2.2.2. IV by BP variance. This shows the BP variance for the DD1000 Report. These
       reports provide the difference in inventory values (in thousands) for the same categories
       totaled on the IPI, and the difference in NSN count from year to year for specified budget
       programs. Normally the differences are from March cycle to March cycle; however,
       alternate cycles can be selected.
       10.2.2.3. These products can be requested at any time for all summary levels. Five years
       of data are available by quarter.
   10.2.3. Item and Dollar Stratification Summary (IDSS). This product can be used at various
   levels to evaluate effectiveness of past actions, and to measure progress toward requirement
   objectives. It provides requirements and asset data, expressed in terms of dollar value, by
   BP, or by NSN by various indentures of funds control to effect improved supply management
   of logistics operations.
       10.2.3.1. An item stratification and a summary stratification are available. The only
       difference is that an item stratification shows quantities and dollars; whereas, the
       summary stratification shows dollars only.
       10.2.3.2. The IDSS can be requested at any time for all summary levels. Five years of
       data are available by quarter.
       10.2.3.3. The IDSS is divided into the following four sections:
          10.2.3.3.1. Aligned Assets (Section 1) shows four time-phased positions.
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                               187


          10.2.3.3.1.1. The Reported (RPT) Position shows the gross requirement (GRS
          RQMT) by WRM, O/S, Z/I, and ADD; the assets in service (AST SVC) by I/P,
          O/S, and Z/I; the WHS SVC by O/S, Z/I, and depot; the WHS USV by O/S, Z/I,
          and depot; funded on order (FND O/O); and total assets.
          10.2.3.3.1.2. The Current Operating (CUR/OP) Position shows the totals of the
          gross requirement, the assets in service, the warehouse serviceable, the warehouse
          unserviceable, the funded on order, the total assets, and the net requirement.
          10.2.3.3.1.3. The Buy Position shows the totals of the gross requirement, the
          assets in-service, the warehouse serviceable, the warehouse unserviceable, the
          funded on order, the total assets, the net requirement, and the adjusted
          requirement.
          10.2.3.3.1.4. The Budget Position shows the totals of the gross requirement, the
          assets in service, the warehouse serviceable, the warehouse unserviceable, the
          funded on order, the total assets, the net requirement, and the adjusted
          requirement.
       10.2.3.3.2. Buy/Budget Segmented Requirements (Section 2) show buy requirements
       and budget requirements both broken out by AF INIT, WRM, ADD, ANG, AFR, and
       REPL.
       10.2.3.3.3. Long Supply (Section 3) shows the dollar values Suitable Long Supply
       Economic (ECON) Retention and Unsuitable Long Supply Contingency (CONT)
       Retention broken out by DIR/HLD, ELE/HLD, and Excess. It also shows Total Long
       Supply. These three categories are further broken out by GRS RQMT, AST SVC,
       WHS SVC, WHS USV, FND O/O, and Total Assets (TOT AST).
       10.2.3.3.4. SGM Totals (Section 4) shows the following data:
          10.2.3.3.4.1. The number of SGMs, quantity, and dollar value of Buy, Budget,
          and Budget +1 Net Requirements; Excess, Termination, Retention, and total
          assets are displayed by ALC. The data is for the items in the selection criteria.
          10.2.3.3.4.2. The assets on-hand include any assets available for the categories
          selected (they may be substitutes used to satisfy requirements somewhere else).
          10.2.3.3.4.3. The total SGM and NSN counts are the total assigned to the IMS, or
          the BP, or whatever category is selected.
          10.2.3.3.4.4. The Computed Elected to Hold shows the difference between the
          highest gross requirements at any position and the gross requirements at the
          higher of the buy or the budget. This is used to determine the amount of Elected
          to Hold asset.
          10.2.3.3.4.5. The AF Elected to Hold shows the Additive Type Requirements 35-
          39. It can be used to see how many Additives the IM is putting in Elected to
          Hold.
          10.2.3.3.4.6. The Contractor Requirements shows the Additive Type
          Requirements 60-69. This field is not used in the Excess/Retention computation.
          It is placed here as an information only field.

                              WEAPON SYSTEM PRODUCT

11.1. General.
   11.1.1. Purpose. The WSP provides the net requirements for each MAJCOM and MDS
   combination being used in the computation. It was designed to replace the IMS manual
   posting of changes to computational data after the update cycle. During the semiannual RAR
   file maintenance, known changes will be file maintained on the RAR product. Corrective
   actions and events occurring at other times in the cycle will be file maintained on the WS
   product. The end result is a more accurate systemic indication of true requirements and the
   dollars needed to support those requirements. When the WS product is file maintained by the
   IMS, the following products are also updated: IA; WSP; PRA; IDSS; IPI; and MPPC.
   11.1.2. Frequency. The WS product is available on line with ―as of‖ dates 31 December, 31
   March, 30 June, and 30 September. File maintenance by the IMS is permitted for each
   quarterly and update cycle. When WS is accessed, the current quarter and previous
   semiannual update cycle can be file maintained.
   11.1.3. Source of Data. The data recorded on the RAR product is the source for the
   information found on the WS product.
       11.1.3.1. RAR Sections 1 through 4 contains the requirements and assets.        Section   1
       includes peacetime requirements and in-use assets by reporting activity.        Section   2
       includes the warehouse and funded/on-order assets by reporting activity.        Section   3
       includes the WRM requirements and in-place assets by WRM base code.             Section   4
       includes additive requirements and in-use assets.
       11.1.3.2. The requirements and assets in RAR Section 1, 3, and 4 are linked to reporting
       MAJCOM and MDS.
       11.1.3.3. The WS product contains the above data, stratified over a twelve year period.
       Seven years are computed and another five years are available for file maintenance.
11.2. WS Content.
   11.2.1. Content. The WS product is designed to show data stratified over 17 program
   positions, covering a 12 year period. The first program position is the reported position.
   D039 stratifies requirements and assets six years beyond the reported position, which covers
   the next 11 program positions. An additional five out years have been added. Data can be
   file maintained into these years if needed to portray out year requirements not included in the
   computation. This product has two sections, both of which are file maintainable by the IMS.
       11.2.1.1. Section 1, Weapon System Data, AD200C2K108ZP. This section, three
       screens wide, contains separate screens for each MDS and MAJCOM combination found
       on the RAR product. The gross requirements, aligned assets, and net requirements are
       displayed for each of the combinations.
       11.2.1.2. Section 2, Weapon System Data, Non-Aligned Assets, AD200C2L108ZP. This
       section, three screens wide, contains two parts. The top part shows non-aligned suitable

                         Note: There will never be more assets aligned than
                         there are requirements. Any asset category
                         exceeding the gross requirement will be reflected in
                         WS, Section 2.

                         completed for the item, an ―X‖ is needed in this
                         field. This will take you to the Notepad where it is
                         necessary to document all the actions taken, as well
                         as any data sources used during the review and
                         analysis. From the Notepad, the computation can be
                         updated.

      11.3.2.1. AF INITIAL: Summary of all reported peacetime requirements from Section 1
      of RAR. Results of programming will be indicated in the different program positions.
      11.3.2.2. ADDITIVE: Summary of all additive requirements file maintained in Section
      4 of RAR except additives using TRC 01-09, 10-15, 25-29, 30-39, and 93-99. Additives
      using 25-29 and 30-39 will not appear in the WS, WSP, or PRA. These additives do not
      increase requirements; they simply retain the assets by placing the assets in economic
      retention on the IDSS.
      11.3.2.3. WRM: Summary of the requirements found in Section 3 of RAR. Additives
      using TRC 01-09 will appear as part of the WRM line.
      11.3.2.4. REPLACEMENT: Summary of the computed replacement requirements
      aligned by the computational system to MDS/MAJCOM net shortages, as well as any
      applicable additives using TRC 10-15 and 93-99.
      11.3.2.5. TOTAL RQMTS: Sum of total requirements by program position.
      11.3.2.6. IN USE: Sum of the in-use assets from Section 1, RAR, and additive in-use
      assets from Section 4, RAR, will be summarized (except TRCs 01-09, 10-15, 25- 29, 30-
      39, 93-99).
      11.3.2.7. IN PLACE: Sum of the in-place assets from Section 3, RAR, and the additives
      in Section 4, RAR, using TRC 01-09.
      11.3.2.8. WHSE SVC: Number of serviceable assets (from Section 2, RAR) that were
      aligned to the MDS/MAJCOM shortages by computational system logic.
      11.3.2.9. WHSE UNSVC: Number of reparable assets (from Section 2, RAR) that were
      aligned to the MDS/MAJCOM shortages by computational system logic.
      11.3.2.10. FND ON ORDER: Number of funded or on order assets (from Section 2,
      RAR) that were aligned to the MDS/MAJCOM shortages by computational system logic.
      11.3.2.11. TOTAL ASSETS: Sum of assets reported by program position and aligned by
      the system.
      11.3.2.12. NET REQUIREMENTS. Difference between TOTAL RQMTS and TOTAL
      ASSETS. Net requirements are further broken down into either initial or replacement for
      each MDS/MAJCOM combination in the WSP. The 405 SCMS/GULA maintained IBM
      display screen contains those applications considered to be in production. By utilizing
      the MDS data in the IBM product, the net requirements on the WS screen can be
      identified as initial (in the case of a MDS match) or replacement (in the case of no
      match). Additive requirements are considered to be initial requirements if the BP/MDS
      match the IBM table and the TRC used in Section 4 of the RAR is not 10-15, 40, 41, or
      93-99. If TRC is 10- 15, 40, 41, or 93-99, the additive requirements are considered to be
      replacement. Further, if the BP/MDS does not match the IBM table, the additive
      requirements are considered to be replacements. Note: A grand total of initial and
      replacement requirements is displayed for the SGM being computed on the PRA product.
  11.3.3. Section 2 Non-Aligned Assets. The non-aligned assets are divided based on the parts
  preference codes. Parts preference codes 4 and 9 indicate the asset is unsuitable (safety
  consideration). All other parts preference codes indicate the asset is suitable for AF use.
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                    195


   Both parts of this section have the same data elements. Assets found in this section are
   suitable assets for which no requirements exist and all unsuitable assets. There is no link to
   MDS or MAJCOM on Section 2 data. Tables 11.4. and 11.5. discuss the various data
   elements.

       2           program positions that span 12 years. In addition, the
                   only assets that will be reflected are the non-aligned,
                   excess assets.
2      REPORTED    The non-aligned assets reflected in the Reported            Add/Change
       ALC/OS/ZI   Position are divided up by location. ALC reflects the
                   assets located at the depots, OS reflects the assets
                   reported outside the continental US (OCONUS). ZI
                   reflects the assets reported within the Z/I or CONUS.

                   dangerous. This field can be used to straight-line a
                   quantity across the 16 remaining program position. It
                   can only be used if the existing data is already
                   straight-lined or all similar data in the category is
                   being deleted.
4      SUITABLE    Suitable Assets are broken down into five categories.
       ASSETS      The in-use line contains reported in-use assets non-
                   aligned to peacetime requirements.
                   The WRM line contains reported in-place assets non-
                   aligned to WRM requirements.
                   WHSE SVC and WHSE UNSVC contain base and
                   depot warehouse assets not aligned with any
                   requirement.
                   FND ON ORD line contains the DIA and funded
                   assets not aligned with any requirement.
                   Note: FND ON ORD Assets exceeding the gross
                   requirement are the assets that are in termination
                   status.
5      UNSUITABLE Unsuitable assets are broken down into the same five
       ASSETS      categories as the suitable assets. However, the assets
                   in this area have a parts preference code of 4 or 9 and
                   are considered unsafe to use. All such reported assets
                   will appear in this area regardless of the shortages that
                   may incur.

      the MDS field <TAB> to the MAJCOM field, type the desired MAJCOM code and press
      <ENTER>. Typing ―FORW‖ at the command line and pressing <ENTER>will allow
      paging through the various MDS/MAJCOM combinations (not necessarily the selected
      MAJCOM).
      11.4.3.4. To review a specific MDS/MAJCOM, type the desired MDS and MAJCOM
      and press <ENTER>.
      11.4.3.5. Once the desired screen is accessed, the current computation cycle or the
      alternate cycle (ALT CYC) will be selected for file maintenance.
      11.4.3.6. The following will be file maintained:
          11.4.3.6.1. REPORTED program position. Both requirements and assets are divided
          into O/S and Z/I. Use <TAB> to select the proper category, then enter the new total
          under O/S and/or Z/I.
          11.4.3.6.2. ALL QTRS (All quarters). If a change applies to all program positions
          (i.e., straight lined), <TAB> to the ALL QTRS on the proper category line and type
 200                                                         AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011


          the new total. All quarters are updated except the REPORTED. Do not use ALL
          QTRS to change existing data without reviewing all 17 program positions.
          11.4.3.6.3. If changes are phased, then <TAB> to the different program positions and
          enter the new totals for each. To file maintain the out-years, type ―RIGH‖ at the
          command line and press <ENTER>. Press <ENTER> before leaving any screen
          which file maintenance has been performed to get the message ―Edit Successful.‖
          Review the Net Requirement. If recalculation is required, type ―X‖ at RECALC and
          press <ENTER> to get the message ―Recalc Successful.‖ To return to a previous
          screen, type ―LEFT‖ at the command line and press <ENTER>.

   Section 1 and press <ENTER>.
       11.4.4.1. Section 2 is single page, three screens wide, with the top half permitting
       changes to non-aligned suitable assets and the bottom half for changes to non-aligned
       unsuitable assets.
       11.4.4.2. The assets in the REPORTED program position of Section 2 are divided into
       ALC, O/S, and Z/I. The rest of the program positions are the same as WS, Section 1.
   11.4.5. Once file maintenance in Section 1 and/or Section 2 is completed, type ―X‖ at
   NOTEPAD and press <ENTER>. Document justification for file maintenance actions taken,
   including the quarterly cycle and year (i.e., Mar 09) to provide a complete audit trail. Then,
   press <ENTER> to obtain ―Edit Successful,‖ and update the data base by typing ―Y‖ at
   UPDATE and pressing <ENTER>.
11.5. WSP Display Product.
   11.5.1. WSP Screens/Products.
       11.5.1.1. Purpose. The RMS WSP screens are designed for on-line viewing of WS data.
       While the data contained is the same as the file maintenance version WS, it is
       summarized and arrayed differently. While the file maintenance WS contains all 17
       quarters, the WSP display selects the reported, current operating, buy, budget and the
       next five out-years (budget+1 through budget+5).
       11.5.1.2. Frequency. The data in the WSP is available at all times. The data is updated
       each quarterly and update cycle. It is also updated as a result of file maintenance on the
       WS product as required.
   11.5.2. The WSP display screens consist of six sections as follows:
       11.5.2.1. Section 1. This section shows requirement and aligned asset quantities by
       MDS and MAJCOM within an SGM for the Reported, Current Operating, Buy, Budget
       and Budget+ 1 through Budget+5 positions. There will be a separate screen for each
       different MDS/ MAJCOM combination.
       11.5.2.2. Section 2. This section provides requirement and aligned asset quantities by
       MAJCOM within an SGM for the Reported, Current Operating, Buy, Budget and
       Budget+1 through Budget+5 positions. There will be separate screens for each different
       MAJCOM.

     11.5.2.3. Section 3. This section shows requirement and aligned asset quantities by
     MDS within an SGM for the Reported, Current Operating, Buy, Budget and Budget+1
     through Budget+ 5 positions. There will be separate screens for each different MDS.
     11.5.2.4. Section 4. This section shows requirement and aligned asset quantities
     summarized by SGM for the Reported, Current Operating, Buy, Budget and Budget+1
     through Budget+ 5 positions.
     11.5.2.5. Sections 5. This section displays excess assets by SGM for the Reported,
     Current Operating, Buy, Budget and Budget+1 through Budget+5 positions.
     11.5.2.6. Section 6, Part 1. This section shows the dollar summary of requirement and
     aligned asset quantities for the Reported, Current Operating, Buy and Budget positions.
     Part 2 will show the out-year dollar summary.
     11.5.2.7. Section 6, Part 2. This section shows the dollar summary of requirement and
     aligned asset quantities for the Budget+1 through Budget+5 positions. Note: Typing
     ―NEXT‖ at the command line and pressing <ENTER> will page to Part 2; Typing
     ―PREV‖ at the command line and pressing <ENTER> will go back to Part 1.
  11.5.3. The WS file maintenance screens consist of two sections as follows:
     11.5.3.1. Section 1. This section shows requirement and aligned asset quantities by
     MDS and MAJCOM within an SGM for all 17 program positions. There will be a
     separate screen for each different MDS/ MAJCOM combination. Figures 11.1 and 11.2
     show a numbered copy of WS Section 1. Tables 11.2 and 11.3 describe each number in
     sequence:
     11.5.3.2. Section 2. This section displays non-aligned assets by SGM for the 17 program
     positions. Figures 11.3 and 11.4 show a numbered copy of WS Section 2. Tables 11.4.
     and 11.5 describe each number in sequence:
  11.5.4. Product Selection Screen.
     11.5.4.1. Access. WSP can be accessed after RMS system logon by typing ―FOE DIS
     EQP WSP.‖ at the command line and pressing <ENTER>.
     11.5.4.2. Product Selection Screen. If WSP is selected, the first screen encountered is
     WSP, Product Selection Screen, AD200C4J108ZP. This screen allows a selection of
     options to display weapon system data. Table 11.6. discusses each selection option.

                                          Chapter 12

           D039 EQUIPMENT REPAIR REQUIREMENTS DETERMINATION

12.1. Purpose. This chapter outlines the policies and procedures required for organic and/or
contract D039/D200C Equipment item repair requirements determination. It identifies the key
processes, roles, and responsibilities for each functional discipline of the Repair IPT: IMS, PMS,
ES and LM from the receipt of the updated Equipment Requirements Computation through
production of the Repair Budget Process. This chapter does not pertain to vehicles.
12.2. Overview. Per           DOD           4140.1-R,        para         C2.6.3.1.5.       (at
http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/414001r.pdf), it is AF policy that repair be the
preferred source of supply for reparable items. Therefore, an IM will make sure all suitable
reparable assets are scheduled for repair when the computation group has a net requirement at
the buy or budget position, or has assets due-in from contracting. In such cases, the IMS must
analyze the elements making up the requirement to determine the feasibility of amending the
materiel repair schedule.
12.3. Basis. This directive is the basis for the development of the ERR Determination process.
As with many processes, the ERR Determination process involves several progressive steps that
require file maintenance actions to be performed within specified time frames. In this process,
file maintenance is performed in the D039/D200C (RMS) during the September Comp cycle,
(the initial, and if necessary the update) and on the ERR Worksheets in the ERR Database. The
first and most crucial step in this process is for the IMS to perform comprehensive file
maintenance actions within D200C during the Initial September Comp Cycle utilizing the file
maintenance guidelines derived from this manual.
   12.3.1. The September initial cycle usually opens in the first week of November and closes
   in the first week of December. The guidelines and the file maintenance schedule for the
   September Comp cycle will be provided by 405 SCMS/GULA to the ALC Equipment OPRs
   and RCO for distribution to the IMS community. Note: It is imperative that the Initial
   September Comp is thoroughly file maintained (scrubbed) to provide accurate data for the
   ERR Worksheets.
   12.3.2. ERR Worksheets are not generated during the March Comp Cycle; however, the IMS
   will review the September ERR Equipment Repair Worksheets against the 31 March Comp
   for any significant changes in the WW Rqmts, In-Use Qty, In-Place Qty, warehouse (whse)
   Svc, or Reps Available. If significant changes are identified, the repair requirements will be
   re-computed, using the ERR database, and any revised repair requirements will be provided
   to the PMS immediately for inclusion into the Budget.
12.4. ERR Database. The second step in this repair requirements determination process is the
file maintenance of the ERR Worksheets. This fully automated worksheet computes repair
requirements for the IMS using information from the scrubbed D039/D200C Computation
(September Comp Update Cycle) as well as the Contractor Asset Visibility Air Force (CAVAF)
system, the Management of Items Subject to Repair Scheduling and Analysis System (G019C),
and the Job Order Production Master System (G004L). These worksheets will be available to
WR-ALC users on the Weekly Reports Server (at: \\Rghdc09110\fs02\Data_Analysis) in the
February timeframe. The file maintenance schedule for update of the ERR Worksheet will be

provided by the 405 SCMS/GULA to the ALC Equipment OPRs and RCOs for distribution to
the IMS community. Unfortunately the ―automated‖ database is only available at WR-ALC at
the present time. The same worksheets in an Excel format are available to other centers on the
405            SCMS/GULA                SE           Repair             SharePoint        site:
https://org.eis.afmc.af.mil/sites/1047/405scms/Rqmts/default.aspx. IMS will fill in necessary
information and the sheet will calculate appropriate data for input into ABCS. ABCS will pass
the necessary data to MP&E.
   12.4.1. Contractor Asset Visibility Report (AFMC Form 197). Because all contractors do
   not file maintain into CAVAF, the IMS may lose visibility of some assets repaired and/or
   condemned at a contractor’s site. The PMS seller is responsible for providing contractor
   asset visibility information to the IMS. On or around 1 October each year, the 405
   SCMS/GULA SE Repair OPR will send an E-mail to the Squadron PMOs to provide to PMS
   sellers a reminder to complete and forward the Contractor Asset Visibility Report (AFMC
   Form 197) to the IMS NLT 1 December of the current year in order for the IMS to file
   maintain the quantities not included in CAVAF into the repair computation. Sellers are
   required to attach documentation (i.e., listings/letters from contractor) to justify the quantities
   on the Contractor Asset Visibility Report (AFMC Form 197) as this requires a change to the
   computed repair requirement. Note: Supporting documentation must be attached.
   12.4.2. Templates are available on the 405 SCMS/GULA                        SharePoint    site at
   https://org.eis.afmc.af.mil/sites/1047/405scms/Rqmts/default.aspx             under       Support
   Equipment Repair.
12.5. NSN baseline. The NSN baseline for the worksheets are ERRC ―S‖ NSNs with
unserviceable assets aligned to a shortage in the September comp update cycle, as well as a
weighted average of the past three years’ reparables generated (IMCD, section D). While the
baseline NSNs present a firm foundation for repair requirements review, the IMS should will
also consider any additional ERRC ―S‖ items for possible inclusion in the repair budget. If the
NSN is not in the ERR database, the IMS will contact the RCO who will then have the NSN
added to the ERR database. The IMS will have the capability to generate worksheets for these
additional NSNs as outlined in the ERR Worksheet User’s Guide that is available on the Weekly
Reports Server (at \\Rghdc09110\fs02\Data_Analysis\Tools). This guide will walk WR-ALC
users through the mechanics of the worksheet in a block by block process. It also provides
useful background information as well as points of contact and telephone numbers. Note: IMS
must input computation information (WW Rqmts, In-Use, In-Place, Whse Svc, Reps Available,
On Order Contract and 3 Year Rep Gen Average) for the newly listed NSNs as it will not overlay
for manually added NSNs.
12.6. Figure 12. 1. is a numbered sample of the ERR Worksheet and Table 12.1. gives a
block-by-block explanation of the information in the ERR worksheet, which is an aid for the
IMS in ―scrubbing‖ the worksheets. The ERR worksheet is designed especially for adjusting the
repair requirements for D200C/D039 equipment items. This worksheet will be coupled with the
IMS’s knowledge and prudent judgment.

                    use this to provide IMs and RCOs with weekly status
                    reports to help track progress. Hopefully this will
                    prevent IMs from waiting until the last possible
                    moment to begin scrubbing comps.


14     NSN          The NSN Selection is the NSN baseline for the ERR
       SELECTION/   worksheets that will be NSNs with unserviceable assets
       Actual NSN   aligned to a shortage as of the asset cut-off date, 30
                    Sep, as well as NSNs with reparable generations in the
                    past 12 months or with average of the number of
                    reparable generations returned to the depot or
                    contractor within the past three years greater than one.
                    While the baseline NSNs present a firm foundation for
                    repair requirements review, the IMS will also consider
                    any additional ERRC ―S‖ items for possible inclusion
                    in the repair budget. The IMS will have the capability
                    to add additional NSNs not in the prior year if
                    necessary. This fully automated worksheet computes
                    repair requirements for the IMS using information from
                    the D200C/D039 Computation as well as the CAVAF
                    and G004L. The IMS will review it for accuracy, make
                    necessary corrections or adjustments.

                    The Actual NSN. Notes: A NSN which has no I&S
                    relationship to any other NSN in the I&S program is
                    considered a "bachelor" NSN, and is treated as if it is
                    both the SGM NSN and the I&S master NSN.
                    Procurement is not by actual NSN, but repair is done
                    on the actual NSN.

                            Budget Year Repair Cost.

29          BUDGET YR       This value is calculated from #28 times the Budget
            REPAIR COST     Year quantity in #38 or #39 (the higher value of the
                            two). It is imperative that this field be calculated in
                            order to derive a total budget year value. The budget
                            year value is used to determine the signature level
                            required on the computation. Computation must be

30          PERCENT OF      The condemnation percentage is computed by taking
            CONDEMNS        the past eight quarters’ condemnations and dividing it
                            by the (past eight quarters’ condemnation + past eight
                            quarters’ repaired). Divide condemnations by the total.
                            This gives the percentage of condemnations.
                            Percentage of repairs will be figured accordingly. This
                            percentage is used to prevent budgeting for the
                            percentage of assets that are expected to be condemned

                            want the NSN to be available. The NSN baseline for
                            the worksheets will be NSNs with unserviceable assets
                            aligned to a shortage in the Sep Comp as well as NSNs
                            with reparable assets generated in the past 12 months

                            greater than one. While the baseline NSNs present a
                            firm foundation for repair requirements review, the
                            IMS will also consider any additional ERRC ―S‖ items
                            for possible inclusion in the repair budget. The IMS
                            has the capability to add a NSN not in the baseline if
                            necessary. If the NSN cannot be added the IMS will
                            contact their RCO, provide them with the NSN, and
                            have the RCO pass the information to the program

12.7. PMS Spreadsheet. The PMS will be provided a spreadsheet from the ERR database. The
PMS buyer is responsible for reviewing and correcting PMS buyer and seller codes, URC (titled
Sales Price on the ERR Worksheet), SOR, PCN, and shop flow days information on the
spreadsheet. A spreadsheet will be provided to the PMS community upon completion of the
ERR data load. Information from the prior year will be used as a baseline. The PMS will review
the provided information for accuracy as well as providing the missing information as noted
above. The URC is used to derive the Budget Year Value at the highest computed position
(before or after file maintenance) and is used to determine the signature level required on the
Equipment Repair Worksheet. In many cases, the PMS will not have the updated price at this
time. Therefore, the prior year URC will be used to determine the signature level. The PMS will
have an opportunity to review again prior to submission to the budget later in the year. The PMS
will have 10 working days to confirm or complete the spreadsheet information. The data
provided by the PMS will then be automatically passed to the ERR database.
12.8. IMS Review. The IMS must review all Equipment Repair Worksheets for accuracy, and
make necessary corrections or adjustments as needed. The IMS ensures the requirement
quantities are correct and adjusts the requirement based on changing scenarios and conditions not
addressed by the D039 (D200C) computation. The IMS must incorporate any changes from the
Contractor Asset Visibility Reports (AFMC Forms #) that were received from the PMS Seller.
This form provides contractor asset information as of 30 September and will be provided by the
PMS seller to the applicable IMS NLT 1 December and condemnations by quarter section of the
ERR Worksheet (#s 33 and 35 on the Block-by-Block instructions, reference Table 12.1). IMs
will ensure adequate documentation (i.e., listings/letters from contractor) is attached to justify the
quantities on the Contractor Asset Visibility Report (AFMC Form 197) as this requires a change
to the computed repair requirement.
      12.8.1. The IMS notifies the LM (via E- mail) of the need to review completed Equipment
      Repair Worksheets. It is not necessary to send an E-mail for every requirement. One E-mail
      with a list of all the IMS’ NSNs will suffice. If the IMS has not received a response from the

   LM within 10 working days of the original E-mail, concurrence will be assumed and the IMS
   will continue with preparations.
   12.8.2. The IMS also notifies the LM, via E-mail, of the need to review completed ERR
   Worksheets computing a repair variance of +/- 5 (qty) between the budget year requirements
   from the prior year versus the budget year requirements of the current year repair projections.
   The IMS will notify the LM to act as the Team Lead of the Repair IPT that will need to
   convene to review these NSNs with variances. The variance is based upon prior year repair
   quantity versus current repair requirements. A red banner will appear in the ―Repair‖ block
   of the ERR Worksheet if this variance occurs (see Table 12.1). Formal IPTs with minutes
   are required for all repair requirements where the computed requirements have been altered
   (greater or less) from the original computed quantity if the extended dollar value of the repair
   in any year exceeds $1M. Formal IPTs with minutes are also required for all DoD-wide
   programs (i.e., pallets and nets) and for all repair programs where the extended dollar value
   of the repair in any year exceeds $5M (even if the computed repair has not been altered).
12.9. Logistics Manager Access. The LM will access the ERR system at the Weekly Reports
Server; copy and save .ADE file to their desktop; check the appropriate requirements; and
approve and/or make necessary corrections to the ERR Worksheet (if needed). If the LM
suggests any changes to the computed repair requirement, justification must be provided and
documented on the ERR Worksheet. Each ERR Worksheet must be signed at the appropriate
level as shown in Attachment 5. Applicable dollar value will appear in Budget Year Repair
Cost block of the ERR Worksheet.
12.10. Repair IPT. The LM will determine if the Repair IPT needs to convene to review the
NSNs with the repair variance of +/- 5 (qty). In some instances, the LM may have the
information that explains the variance and an official meeting will not be necessary. If the
Repair IPT is convened and it validates and/or documents any changes to the repair information,
minutes must be attached to the ERR Worksheet and every team member must sign the ERR
Worksheet. Formal IPTs with minutes are required for all repair requirements where the
computed requirements have been altered (greater or less) from the original computed quantity if
the extended dollar value of the repair in any year exceeds $1M. Formal IPTs with minutes are
also required for all DoD-wide programs (i.e., pallets and nets) and for all repair programs where
the extended dollar value of the repair in any year exceeds $5M (even if the computed repair has
not been altered). These minutes must also be attached to the ERR worksheet and documented
in the remarks block.
12.11. IMS. The IMS must ensure:
   12.11.1. All quantities on the ERR Worksheet are accurate;
   12.11.2. All required documentation is attached (see previous paragraphs);
   12.11.3. All levels of review are complete and ERR Worksheets signed IAW Atch 5.
   12.11.4. All signed ERR Worksheets are provided to the PMS by the cut-off date (will be
   provided by the 405 SCMS/GULA - usually 1 April). See Atch 5 for signature levels.
Note: When possible, IMS will provide ERR Worksheets to the PMS buyer on an ―as-
completed‖ basis so the PMS can begin gathering information as soon as possible.
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                    217


12.12. PMS Review. The PMS will review the repair quantities per line item, and make
adjustments as necessary based on known or anticipated management production problems that
will inhibit or prohibit induction/production of the planned workload. Adjustments made based
on this knowledge must be coordinated with the IMS and documented as to the reason for the
adjustment.     All changes will be documented and signed onto the ERR Worksheet
(documentation must be attached). Written justification must be provided for all deviations from
the computed requirement. Formal IPTs with minutes are required for all repair requirements
where the computed requirements have been altered from the original computed quantity if the
extended dollar value of the repair in any year exceeds $1M). These actions, taken together,
ensure that the ALC computes an adequate, valid requirement to present to higher headquarters
for future funds. The PMS will understand that final repair requirement on the ERR Worksheet
is what will be submitted to the budget.
12.13. PMS Changes. If changes are made by the PMS, ERR Worksheets will be returned to
the IMS for further review by all levels required (reference Atch 5). The IMS will provide all
final signed copies of the ERR Worksheets to the PMS buyer as quickly as possible to ensure
timely submission to the budget. IMS will need to provide justification for changes between
current year computed repair requirement and previous year if necessary. Both the PMS and the
IMS will retain signed, final copies (with documentation) of the ERR Worksheet for two years
for audit purposes.
12.14. ABCS Repair Requirements File Maintenance. ABCS is no longer utilized by WR-
ALC in the D039/D200C repair budget process due to the fact that inadequate equipment repair
data from ABCS was being pulled into the MP&E which is used for Core, Posture Planning and
Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) decisions. The IMS will ensure that the PMS receives a
printed copy of each ERR Worksheet; this will be the PMS’s breakout of the repair requirement
since they will no longer receive a B21 from ABCS. However, the IMS and PMS buyers and
sellers must work together to refine the D039/D200C equipment repair requirements. Even
though file maintenance is no longer required in ABCS, the PMS is still responsible for the
assignment of the PCN, SOR, shop flow days, the unit repair cost (sales price), the quantities of
past production, and the quantities that have been previously funded but not delivered.
12.15. ALC OPR. The ALC OPR will provide a spreadsheet to PMOs and RCOs after close of
the ERR database requesting review and possibly additional information to include, but not
limited to, correction of PMS codes (if necessary), PCN, SOR, and shop flow days. Missing
information will be provided to the IMS for input into the ERR Database. Suspense will be
provided by the 405 SCMS/GULA. The PMS will use this information, provided by an Excel
spreadsheet, to review PCN totals for accuracy.
12.16. PMS Projection. PMS rolls NSN requirements to the PCN level to project MAJCOM
requirements for the budget.
   12.16.1. The PMS ensures accuracy of PCN and USP (or URC) inputs into the DPEM
   database.
   12.16.2. The PMS prints the PCN requirements report from the DPEM database and retains
   for two years.
12.16.3. The LM (or IMS) manually develops each MAJCOM repair requirement under
the PCN. Factors considered typically include:
 218                                                           AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011


       12.16.3.1. Past requirements;
       12.16.3.2. Outstanding backorders;
       12.16.3.3. Planned deliveries from both procurement and repair;
       12.16.3.4. Reparables available and/or expected to generate;
       12.16.3.5. SOR capacity to repair the required items;
       12.16.3.6. Negotiations with field level users and/or MAJCOM representatives; and
       12.16.3.7. MAJCOM in-use assets as a percentage of totals in use assets derived from
       the Table of Allowance allocations.
Note: The PMS buyer and seller need to be involved in this development.
12.17. LM (or IMS) Rounding. If required, the LM (or IMS) rounds up the dollar value of
requirement to equal a ―full unit‖ of repair and passes the PCN requirement (for each MAJCOM)
to the PMS.
12.18. 405 SCMS/GULA and DPEM Office Review. The 405 SCMS/GULA and DPEM
Office will review budget submission data against the ERR database to ensure consistency. The
IMS and PMS (jointly) are responsible for providing corrected data for conflicting submissions
in a timely manner.
12.19. DPEM Office Notification. The DPEM office notifies the repair OPR of the file
maintenance dates for the DPEM database, which is the application that produces the budget
submission. In turn, the repair OPR notifies the IMS and PMS buyers.
12.20. PMS Buyer DPEM File Maintenance. The PMS Buyer file maintains validated repair
requirements into the DPEM database.
   12.20.1. For reimbursable items, the PMS file maintains using the PCN Requirements
   Report from ERR.
   12.20.2. Direct cite items. The PMS file maintains valid repair requirements as provided by
   Repair IPT.
   12.20.3. The PMS file maintains the description and variance narratives obtained from the
   Repair IPT.
12.21. Repair OPR Consolidation. The repair OPR will consolidate completed DPEM
databases & notify DPEM office.
12.22. DPEM Office. The DPEM office will:
   12.22.1. Review the DPEM database and notify repair OPRs for necessary adjustments.
   12.22.2. Produce the Budget Pre-Review Brochure.
   12.22.3. Host the Budget Review.
       12.22.3.1. MAJCOMs and Product Groups review requirements.
   12.22.3.2. Changes required as a result of the review are input to the DPEM database for
   final submission by the repair OPR. The repair OPR will direct changes to be documented
   on the signed ERR Worksheet by the appropriate Repair IPT personnel.
AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011                                                                    219


   12.22.4. Produce the Budget Post-Review Brochure.
Note: The spares community uses EXPRESS to determine repair prioritization of reparable
assets on a daily basis. The AF equipment community does not have a product that identifies
unserviceable equipment assets (not currently inducted for repair) to valid requirements. The
D039/D200C computation applies unserviceable assets to valid requirements and failure to repair
(or delays in repair) means that the valid requirement goes unfilled. An automated program has
been developed that identifies unserviceable equipment assets with a valid requirement (i.e., a
current requisition). The program prioritizes the Repair Backlog Listing of unserviceable assets
with the requisitions. The program uses the same basic logic as the buy prioritization (i.e., FAD
and use codes). If these equipment assets have already been inducted into repair, then the list
offers the opportunity to correct erroneous repair induction data. The 405 SCMS/GULA will run
the Repair Backlog Listing monthly (more often during the FY, if necessary) and make it
available to the IMS on the Centrally Managed Support Equipment Requirements Policies and
Procedures CoP (at
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID=OO-RQ-MC-16-

 226                                                         AFMCMAN 23-4 26 JULY 2011


Code    Meaning
        coordinated effort, and will be periodically reviewed to ensure factor is still
        appropriate. This code requires documentation which explains how the factor is
        determined.
B       Replacement requirements are to be computed by the PULE method using IMCD
        Section E data. (Note: The replacement factor is zero in IMCD Section A, however,
        SGM NSN PULE replacement factors are provided on IMCD Section A Continued and
        Section E.
C       Replacement requirements are to be computed using the mechanically determined
        replacement factor in IMCD Section A. The mechanical factor is computed using the
        condemnation and in-use data from IMCD Section D. Codes ―D‖ and ―G‖, file
        maintained by IMS, will mechanically convert to ―C‖ when adequate data is available.
        Further, ―C‖ will revert to ―H‖ if insufficient data is available.
D       Replacement factor is to be computed by the PULE technique until sufficient in-use
        and condemnation data are available. When PULE logic is used, the replacement
        factor is equal to zero on IMCD Section A; computed PULE replacement factors are
        provided in IMCD Section A Continued and Section E. However, if PULE data is not
        available and if insufficient in-use history and condemnation data are available, the
        replacement criteria code will revert to ―H.‖ The replacement criteria code will change
        to ―C‖ when sufficient data is available.
E       ORTEM procedures are used. The replacement factor is not mechanically computed
        and will be equal to zero on IMCD Section A. Replacement quantities are input as
        additive requirements.
F       Replacement requirements are developed in accordance with technical order
        compliance guidance. The replacement factor is equal to zero on IMCD Section A.
        Replacement quantities are input as additive requirements.
G       Replacement factor will be manually file maintained until sufficient in-use and
        condemnation data are available. When sufficient data is available, the replacement
        criteria code will automatically be changed to ―C.‖
H       System Default. Mechanically entered when a new item is introduced (less than four
        quarters of history) or inadequate condemnation and in-use data are available. The
        replacement criteria code will change to ―C‖ when sufficient data is available.
Blank   For REMS vehicles, replacement is determined by use of the vehicle replacement
        code/age, not by the replacement factor; therefore, the replacement factor for registered
        vehicular items is zero.
13.19. System Essentiality Code (SEC). The SEC is the first position of the Mission Item
Essentiality Code (MIEC) on the IMCD report and is computed using MDS. It is also known as
the application essentiality code

Table 13.19. SEC
Code    Meaning
1       Highly critical system (FAD I).
2       Strategic systems.
3       Forward deployed tactical systems.
4       Continental United States systems in place by D+1.
5       Reserve systems in place by D+30.

Code     Meaning
6        Systems in place by D+30.
7        FMS peculiar applications (SEC equal to 7 is not applicable to ALC-managed
         equipment items.)
13.20. Termination Code (TERMINATION CD). Used on IMCD report to indicate the
reason for taking termination/reduction or non-termination action of funded/on-order assets.

Table 13.20. TERMINATION CD
Code     Meaning
A        Items on contract will be terminated
B        Termination action was taken in a prior review. Date of termination action must be
         provided.
C        Item on contract was delivered after the asset cutoff date. Date of delivery must be
         provided.
D        Items were diverted to other uses after the asset cutoff date
E        Item does not require reduction or termination after erroneous data has been corrected
F        Item is ineligible for reduction or termination action due to higher headquarters’
         direction. Office symbol and point of contact in headquarters must be provided.
G        Item will not be reduced or terminated for reasons other than provided for in other
         codes. An explanation and justification must be provided for this decision as required
         by local ALC policy/procedures.
I        The computation is correct, but the item will not be reduced or terminated because
         more than the actual computed buy was procured to obtain a price break; i.e., quantity
         discount, life of type buy, minimum buy, etc.
M        Purchase request was canceled in a prior review. Date of cancellation must be
         provided.
P        Item on purchase request will be canceled

         of reduction action must be provided.
R        Item on purchase request will be reduced. Amount of reduction must be provided.
T        Reduction action on the contract was taken in a prior review. Date and amount of
         reduction must be provided. Requirements personnel must provide date, quantity and
         total dollar amount of reduction to appropriate organizational office. The
         organizational office will forward this information to the HQ AFMC focal point for
         equipment item termination reporting.
Y        Item on contract will be partially terminated. Amount of reduction must be provided.
Z        Contractor bankruptcy or other litigation prevents termination of contract.
