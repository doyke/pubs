Terms
Air Reserve Technician (ART)โFull-time civilian employees who are also members of the Air
Force Reserve unit in which they are employed. In addition to their civilian assignments, they are
assigned to equivalent positions in the Reserve organization with a Reserve military rank or
grade. ARTs must maintain active membership in their Reserve unit of assignment and
satisfactory participation in order to keep their ART position.
ART Centralized Classification ProgramโA classification program for ART positions that is
centralized at and administered by HQ AFRC/A1C. The administration of this program includes
developing and issuing standardized position descriptions (SPD) for the ART which are
prescriptive in nature. The issuance of prescriptive SPDs provides for consistency in grade
allocation and organizational structure throughout AFRC, and ensures dual-status compatibility.
ART Officer Career Management ProgramโA career management program which provides
standards and guidelines to enhance the intellectual and professional growth of ART officers in
both their civilian and military careers to ensure highly qualified ART officers are available to
assume positions of increased responsibility and scope throughout the Air Force Reserve.
AFR Special Examining Unit (SEU)โA special unit operated by the Air Force Reserve to
which the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has delegated authority to conduct
examinations and referrals for ART positions under OPM rules and regulations.
Non Dual Status Technician (NDST)โโThose individuals occupying ART positions who
lose active membership in their Reserve unit of assignment for reasons considered to be beyond
their control, but are retained in the civilian portion (Part A) of their ART position.
Relocation Services ProgramโA program designed to minimize the financial impact of
permanent change of station (PCS) moves, make transition from the former duty station to the
new duty station easier for the employee and the Air Force, and to provide an alternative to
current direct reimbursement of PCS expenses.
Career AppointmentโPermanent appointment in the competitive service after successfully
completing the required term of service in a career-conditional appointment. This is typically a
three year period.
Career-Conditional AppointmentโPermanent appointment in the competitive service of a
person who has not yet completed the required period of creditable, substantially continuous
federal service.
