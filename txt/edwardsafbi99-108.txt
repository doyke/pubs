1. GENERAL
     1.1. Objective. The EAFB Control Room Training and Evaluation program objective is to
     ensure test control personnel are trained and evaluated thoroughly and consistently to execute
     test missions safely and effectively.
     1.2. Overview. The training of Test Control Personnel (TCP) is divided into two phases.
     Phase I training and qualifications encompass basic TCP skills transferable across test
     organizations. Phase II training is specific to aircraft type, unique aircraft systems,
     specialized test techniques, test missions and unique test equipment. Each test organization
     creates its own Phase II training requirements.
     1.3. Any authority granted to the commander/director by this instruction may be delegated to
     an appropriate authority within the organization as determined by the commander/director.
     1.4. Definitions.
        1.4.1. Safety of test (SOT) parameters are those defined in test and safety planning (IAW
        AFFTCI 91-105) as critical to the safe execution of the test.
        1.4.2. Consistent with AFFTCI 99-105, a Control Room (CR) is any facility, ground or
        airborne, that provides two-way communication between test execution aircrew and test
        control personnel and provides real time capability to monitor safety of flight, safety of
        test, and/or quality of test information. When the control room is airborne, test control
        personnel may also be required to maintain aircrew qualifications outside the scope of
        this instruction.
EDWARDSAFBI99-108 21 JANUARY 2014                                                             3


     1.4.3. TCP evaluate and monitor aircraft, systems under test, and instrumentation
     systems to make, or provide recommendations for, test execution decisions. TCP
     positions include Test Director (TD), Test Conductor (TC), and Discipline Engineer (DE,
     which includes special instrumentation engineers). Personnel who are required by their
     test organization to occupy a position in the control room or whose presence is required
     by an operating instruction, test plan, or safety plan will be trained and qualified in a
     position commensurate with the applicable CR duties.
  1.5. Scope. This instruction applies to military, government civilian, and contractor test
  control personnel conducting ground or flight test operations for all EAFB units and
  detachments regardless of their operating location.
     1.5.1. Guest Personnel. Personnel who are not permanently assigned with an EAFB test
     organization and perform CR duties on a temporary basis are considered guest TCP.
     Temporary basis is defined as no more than 12 missions in any 6 month period.
         1.5.1.1. Guest TCP who monitor safety of test and/or perform TC/TD duties will
         adhere to the training and evaluation requirements of this instruction.
         1.5.1.2. Guest Personnel who are performing DE duties and not monitoring safety of
         test parameters are required to provide the following with endorsement by the test
         organization commander/director.
             1.5.1.2.1. Proof of CRM academic training (paragraph 4.1.3).
             1.5.1.2.2. Proof of training and/or experience equivalent to Phase I DE training
             (paragraph 2.4).
             1.5.1.2.3. Proof of applicable system-under-test or other specialized training
             and/or experience required for the execution of CR duties equivalent to Phase II
             training (paragraph 2.5).
     1.5.2. This instruction does not apply to specialists assigned to range organizations, such
     as range control officers and CR technicians. These specialists will be trained and
     evaluated IAW their own organization’s guidelines and instructions.
     1.5.3. This instruction does not apply to facilities maintenance, mission observers, or
     those who may be present in a CR but not performing duties as TCP.
  1.6. Acceptance of Training and/or Qualification. The test organization commander/director
  may accept the training and/or qualifications of TCP from other organizations. Acceptance of
  training and/or qualification will be signed by the commander/director and documented in the
  individual’s training folder.
     1.6.1. Within 60 days of publication of this instruction, test organization
     commanders/directors will draft an Initial Qualification and Certification Memorandum.
     This memorandum should include a list of those personnel, currently assigned or attached
     to the unit, who are immediately qualified, in accordance with the superseded instruction,
     to perform the CR duties according to the qualifications and certifications within this
     instruction. Those individuals listed on the memorandum will not require additional
     training to perform the duties identified in the memorandum, but must adhere to currency
     and requalification requirements established in this instruction.

     1.7. Simulations/Rehearsals. A CR simulation or rehearsal may be used for the purposes of
     Phase I execution training, evaluations, Phase II certification training, currency items, and
     Crew Resource Management (CRM) annual training events.
     1.8. Airborne TCP.
        1.8.1. An airborne control room is acceptable for all aspects of training and evaluation in
        this instruction.
        1.8.2. Unit developed CR training plans for airborne control rooms should include items
        applicable to the flight environment.
        1.8.3. Aircrew qualification alone is not sufficient to perform CR duties while airborne.
     1.9. Letter of Xs. Each test organization will maintain a letter of qualifications/certifications
     for TCP approved by the commander/director. An example is shown in Table 1-1.
     1.10. Evaluation Authority. The test organization commander/director is the principal
     evaluator of TCP and the evaluation approval authority in the test organization.
     1.11. Waivers. Unless otherwise specified, the 412 OG is the waiver authority for
     requirements in this instruction.

       2.2.2. Training Folders. The TCP’s primary test organization will maintain all training
       and qualification records, regardless of which organization provided the training or
       qualification. Records will be maintained using training folders in electronic or paper
       format.
           2.2.2.1. Training folders will include at a minimum: (a) training records (proof of
           prerequisite training, Phase I/II documentation, etc.), (b) evaluation records, (c)
           acceptance of training/qualification memorandums, if applicable, with supporting
           documentation, and (d) documentation of annual instruction reviews and annual CRM
           events.
           2.2.2.2. Proof of currency for control room events (paragraph 4.1.1) and Phase II
           Aircraft Systems (paragraph 4.1.2) must also be maintained for each TCP.
    2.3. Special Considerations.
       2.3.1. Training shall not take place during medium or high risk test events, unless
       approved by the test organization commander/director. For example, training for certain
       elevated risk tests may, in the judgment of the commander/director, require training
       during elevated risk testing.
       2.3.2. Contractors may provide Phase I and Phase II training to their employees using
       their own training plans and forms. However, the training must be documented in an
       acceptance of training memorandum signed by the test organization commander/director.
       2.3.3. During actual missions, an instructor may not perform additional CR duties
       outside the scope of the applicable instructor duties, unless approved by the test
       organization commander/director. For example, the instructor who is training an
       unqualified DE may not act as TD during the same mission even though they may hold a
       TD qualification.
    2.4. Phase I – Control Room Qualification Training
       2.4.1. Phase I training accomplishes prerequisites required for qualification of the TCP
       positions TC, TD, and DE. It establishes the basic skills and techniques required to
       conduct missions in CRs, independent of mission, aircraft, or location.
       2.4.2. Training Plans. Test organizations may append training items to the minimum
       curricula defined in this instruction. The test organization commander/director is the
       approval authority for modified training plans.
       2.4.3. Prerequisites. The following are required to complete Phase I training unless
       waived by the test organization commander/director. The items will be documented in the
       individual’s training folder and may be accomplished in concurrence with Phase I
       training.
           2.4.3.1. Crew Resource Management (CRM) academics (paragraph 4.1.3).
           2.4.3.2. Fundamentals of Test Conduct course provided by, or a similar course
           approved by, the 412 OG/OGV. This course is mandatory for TCs, and recommended
           for TDs and DEs. This course may be waived by the test organization
           commander/director due to prior experience or education.
EDWARDSAFBI99-108 21 JANUARY 2014                                                            7


        2.4.3.3. Flight Test Orientation (FTO). FTO is required before TCP may perform
        control room duties during EAFB test events. FTO outlines test center, wing, group,
        and CTF specific test procedures, equipment, support facilities, decision criteria, and
        test mission requirements. Completion of FTO training, as defined in AFI 112FTV1,
        or the Fundamentals of Test Conduct course (paragraph 2.4.3.2) may be used to
        satisfy this requirement. FTO training may be provided by instructor qualified TCP or
        instructor qualified test aircrew.
        2.4.3.4. Local Area Orientation (LAO). LAO is required before TCP may perform
        control room duties during test events that originate from, or occur within, the R2508
        airspace complex. LAO includes a familiarization of applicable flight operations
        publications and procedures of the local flying area and applicable test ranges.
        Completion of LAO training, as defined in AFI 112FTV1, may be used to satisfy this
        requirement. LAO training may be provided by instructor aircrew assigned to EAFB.
     2.4.4. Ground Training.
        2.4.4.1. Ground training consists of academics and concept development of control
        room techniques and procedures. The minimum ground training curriculum shall
        include discussions on crew resource management and instruction in test conduct
        terminology and communication, basic flight test techniques, control room
        procedures, and applicable instructions. Ground training must be completed before
        the start of execution training.
        2.4.4.2. At a minimum, ground training for all TCP will include a review of the
        following instructions (and local supplements where applicable): AFFTCI 11-1 Air
        Operations, AFFTCI 91-105 AFFTC Test Safety Review Process, AFFTCI 99-1 Test
        Plans, EAFBI 99-8 Flight Test Control Personnel Training and Evaluation, and
        AFFTCI 99-105 Test Control and Conduct.
     2.4.5. Execution Training.
        2.4.5.1. Execution training consists of control room events (defined in paragraph
        4.1.1) in which the trainee performs applicable control room duties under the
        instruction of a qualified instructor as part of an approved training plan.
        2.4.5.2. The minimum execution training curriculum shall include, but is not limited
        to, the monitoring of parameters, the execution of test cards, team communication,
        and events inherent to specific control room duties. The trainee will learn and
        demonstrate the skills and procedures required of their TCP position.
        2.4.5.3. Opportunities for trainees to observe mission execution may be included in
        test organization training programs. These events will not be counted as execution
        training.
     2.4.6. The minimum Phase I training for TCs and TDs will include test card preparation
     and approval, safety review process, air and/or ground radio communications, briefing
     and debriefing, and test range operations.
     2.4.7. Training duration. All Phase I trainees will have 6 months to complete a qualifying
     evaluation from the first Phase I training event. Training accomplished more than 6
8                                                EDWARDSAFBI99-108 21 JANUARY 2014


       months prior to a qualifying evaluation will be re-accomplished before the evaluation.
       Waivers to this restriction may be approved by the test organization commander/director.
       2.4.8. Instructor Requirements. Phase I training shall be given by an instructor qualified
       in the respective CR position. Test organization commanders/directors may allow
       instructor TCs/TDs to train DEs.
       2.4.9. Instructor Training Program.
           2.4.9.1. Test organizations will establish a TCP instructor training program. The test
           organization commander/director will designate individuals eligible for instructor
           upgrade based on the individual’s experience, judgment, demonstrated CR skill,
           technical knowledge, and instructing ability.
           2.4.9.2. Minimum curriculum for instructor training shall include the minimum
           curriculum for Phase I ground and execution training with the addition of instructor
           concepts and techniques. Instructor training plans will be documented on unique
           AFMC Forms 67, 68, and 69, as applicable.
           2.4.9.3. The training of instructors may be accomplished by any instructor qualified
           in the same CR position. Test organization commanders/directors may allow
           instructor TCs/TDs to train instructor DEs.
    2.5. Phase II – Mission Certification Training
       2.5.1. Phase II mission certifications encompass aircraft type, unique aircraft systems,
       specialized test techniques and unique equipment for which qualified TCP may conduct
       test. Phase II certifications do not require evaluations. See Table 1-1 for examples.
       2.5.2. TCP must hold a Phase II certification in order to perform control room duties
       during a test event that encompasses the same aircraft or specialty for which the
       certification is given, unless instructed by a qualified instructor (paragraph 2.5.7.1)
       during that event.
       2.5.3. Training plans. Test organizations will develop and maintain Phase II training
       plans specific to their organization, test mission requirements, and Control Room
       requirements. Test organizations will determine the minimum ground and/or execution
       training required for each Phase II certification. Phase II training plans will be
       documented on separate AFMC Forms 67, 68, and 69, as applicable.
       2.5.4. Concurrent Training. Phase II training may be accomplished concurrently with
       Phase I training. Multiple Phase II training plans may be accomplished concurrently.
       2.5.5. Phase II Aircraft Systems Certifications.
           2.5.5.1. Aircraft Systems Training is Mission Design Series (MDS) specific training.
           This training will focus on aircraft mission, operating parameters and limitations,
           emergency procedures, test unique systems, aircraft and/or test item characteristics,
           representative flight test techniques, and data acquisition system capabilities and
           operation.
           2.5.5.2. Successful completion of non-rated aircrew ground and flight training
           requirements, as defined in AFI 11-2FTV1, may be accepted as Phase II
EDWARDSAFBI99-108 21 JANUARY 2014                                                              9


          Aircraft Systems certification. Documentation of the training must be included in the
          individual’s TCP training folder.
      2.5.6. Phase II Specialized Certifications.
          2.5.6.1. Test organizations will develop Phase II specialized training programs to
          train TCP in the conduct of specialized test systems, missions, or test techniques.
          Examples might include, but are not limited to, elevated risk events, high angle of
          attack, structures/loads, safe separation, weapons employment, highly modified
          MDSs, or test missions requiring critical CRM functions in the CR.
          2.5.6.2. Differences Training. When significant test unique modifications exist for an
          MDS or Control Room which impact TCP duties, as determined by the test
          organization commander/director, difference training will be required before
          performing control room duties for the respective MDS or Control Room. This
          training will be documented as a Phase II Specialized Certification.
      2.5.7. Instructor Requirements.
          2.5.7.1. Phase II Certification Training may be given by any instructor TCP holding
          the same certification or by subject matter experts as approved by the organization
          commander/director. Aircraft Systems Certifications may be provided by instructor
          qualified test aircrew, even if not qualified as TC/TD/DE under this instruction.
          2.5.7.2. Initial Cadre. Test programs may arise that present unique requirements not
          covered in existing Phase II specialized training (e.g. new aircraft, extensive
          modifications to aircraft, new test technique, extensive downtime between test
          programs, etc.). Under these conditions, a memo signed by the test organization
          commander/director may establish an initial cadre from current and qualified TCP.
          This memo will be included in the TCP’s training folder.
3. Evaluation
   3.1. Test organizations will conduct evaluations to ensure qualifications of test control
   personnel and supplementary evaluations to ensure standardization of CR operations.
   3.2. An individual may hold more than one CR position qualification (TC, TD, or DE).
   3.3. The test organization commander/director will designate CR evaluator candidates from
   their pool of TCP instructors. Prior to performing evaluator duties, evaluator candidates will
   complete evaluator upgrade training with the 412 OG/OGV. This training will be
   documented in the candidate’s training records.
   3.4. Evaluations shall be given by an evaluator qualified in the respective TCP position. Test
   organization commanders/directors may allow evaluator TCs/TDs to evaluate DEs.
   3.5. Evaluators will not administer evaluations to personnel who are responsible for writing
   or endorsing the evaluator’s performance report without specific approval from the test
   organization commander/director.
   3.6. Documentation.
10                                              EDWARDSAFBI99-108 21 JANUARY 2014


     3.6.1. Control room evaluations will be documented on a 412OG/OGV approved TCP
     evaluation form and will include the category and prefix of the evaluation. Forms that
     contain privacy act information must be in compliance with AFI 33-360.
  3.7. Evaluation Categories. TCP evaluations are divided into three categories.
     3.7.1. QUAL. Basic qualification in a CR position.
     3.7.2. INSTR. An instructor qualification focuses primarily on the TCP’s instructional
     ability in their CR position but also includes the basic skills associated with that CR
     position. INSTR evaluations should be accomplished with real students whenever
     possible. When students are not available, another TCP or the evaluator may serve as a
     surrogate student. A successful INSTR evaluation still allows a TCP to perform the basic
     duties of the position for which the evaluation was given.
     3.7.3. SPOT. Spot evaluations may be conducted at the organization’s discretion or for
     cause. Spot evaluations are intended to evaluate a subset of CR skills included in the
     evaluation criteria.
  3.8. Prefixes. The following prefixes will be used, when applicable, to further describe the
  evaluations listed in paragraph 3.7.
     3.8.1. INIT (Initial). The first evaluation of a basic or instructor qualification. Initial
     qualifications are required for TCP with no previous qualifications or if the most recent
     qualification has lapsed more than five years. At least two execution training sessions are
     required prior to an INIT evaluation, unless waived by the organization
     commander/director. Initial evaluations expire on the last day of the 17th month following
     a successful initial evaluation.
     3.8.2. PER (Periodic). Periodic evaluations are subsequent evaluations of a basic or
     instructor qualification. Periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the 17th month
     following the last successful QUAL or INSTR evaluation. Periodic evaluations will be
     scheduled in the eligibility period, which opens on the first day of the 12th month after the
     last successful QUAL or INSTR evaluation. Execution training sessions are not required
     prior to a PER evaluation but may be directed by the test organization
     commander/director.
         3.8.2.1. To maintain instructor qualification, a TCP requires instructor evaluations
         during subsequent periodic evaluations.
         3.8.2.2. Evaluations accomplished prior to eligibility period do not satisfy the
         periodic evaluation requirement and will not adjust the existing evaluation expiration
         date. The test organization commander/director may authorize individuals to
         complete periodic evaluations prior to the eligibility period.
     3.8.3. RQ (Requalification). A requalification evaluation is required for personnel who
     did not receive a periodic evaluation before the last successful evaluation expires. At least
     one execution training session is required prior to the evaluation, unless waived by the
     organization commander/director. RQ evaluations expire on the last day of the 17th month
     following a successful evaluation.
     3.8.4. N/N (No-Notice). Provides commanders/directors a sampling of daily TCP
     performance and an assessment of organization’s training effectiveness. Examinee is
EDWARDSAFBI99-108 21 JANUARY 2014                                                             11


     notified of the evaluation at the beginning of normal preparation for the mission, as
     defined by the test organization.
  3.9. Evaluation Procedures.
     3.9.1. Evaluations will be conducted according to the evaluation criteria found in
     attachments to this instruction. These criteria define the minimum evaluation criteria for
     the qualification of TCP. Test organizations may append additional criteria as approved
     by the test organization commander/director. To ensure standard and objective
     evaluations, evaluators will be thoroughly familiar with and adhere to the prescribed
     evaluation criteria.
     3.9.2. An evaluator may not perform additional CR duties outside the scope of the
     applicable evaluator duties, unless approved by the test organization commander/director.
     For example, an evaluator TD who is evaluating a DE during a mission may not act as
     TD for the same mission.
     3.9.3. The evaluator will brief the examinee on the purpose of the evaluation and how it
     will be conducted, to include specific evaluation criteria, prior to observing examinee
     performance during the evaluation.
     3.9.4. The evaluator will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the evaluation. This debrief
     will include the examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if
     other than qualified), and any required additional training.
     3.9.5. Grading Instructions. A two step grading system is used to evaluate and document
     TCP performance.
         3.9.5.1. In the first step, individual grades are assigned to each area/subarea of TCP
         performance against established evaluation criteria. Areas/subareas have a three-tier
         (Q/Q-/U) or two-tier (Q/U, for critical areas) grading system. Any area graded U will
         have additional comments documenting the reason.
            3.9.5.1.1. A grade of Q (qualified) indicates the examinee demonstrated both a
            satisfactory knowledge of all required information of the area/subarea and
            performed CR duties within prescribed expectations.
            3.9.5.1.2. A grade of Q- (marginally qualified) indicates the examinee is qualified
            to perform the assigned area/subarea task, but requires debriefing specific to
            minor discrepancies in that area.
            3.9.5.1.3. A grade of U (unqualified) indicates performance in the area/subarea
            was outside allowable parameters, compromising safety and/or quality of test,
            affecting mission accomplishment, or breaching CR discipline, requiring
            additional training.
         3.9.5.2. In the second step, the evaluator assigns an overall qualification level from a
         composite of all area/subarea grades based on the following.
            3.9.5.2.1. Q1 (Qualified). The TCP demonstrated desired performance and
            knowledge of procedures, facilities, and directives within expectations specified
            in the grading criteria. Award a Q1 when no discrepancies were noted. If
            discrepancies existed, a Q1 may be awarded if:
12                                             EDWARDSAFBI99-108 21 JANUARY 2014


                3.9.5.2.1.1. No U grades were awarded for any area.
                3.9.5.2.1.2. In the judgment of the evaluator, none of the discrepancies
                preclude awarding an overall Q1.
                3.9.5.2.1.3. All areas/sub-areas graded as Q- during the evaluation were
                cleared during the debrief.
            3.9.5.2.2. Q2 (Qualified with discrepancies). The TCP demonstrated the ability to
            perform duties safely, but:
                3.9.5.2.2.1. Additional training was assigned to one or more area(s)/sub-
                area(s).
                3.9.5.2.2.2. A non-critical area/subarea grade of U was awarded.
                3.9.5.2.2.3. In the judgment of the evaluator, justification of a Q2 grade exists
                based on Q- performance in one or several area(s)/subarea(s).
            3.9.5.2.3. Q3 (Unqualified). The TCP demonstrated an unacceptable level of
            safety, performance, or knowledge. An examinee that receives an overall Q3
            grade must receive training in those areas where deficiencies were noted.
            Additional training must be signed-off by an instructor prior to a subsequent
            evaluation. Award an overall grade of Q3 if:
                3.9.5.2.3.1. The examinee receives a grade of U in any critical area.
                3.9.5.2.3.2. In the judgment of the evaluator, justification of a Q3 grade exists
                based on Q- or U performance in one or several non-critical
                area(s)/subarea(s).
     3.9.6. Remedial Action. All grades of Q- or U require a thorough debriefing of the
     discrepancy and/or assignment of additional training. Additional training may include,
     but not limited to, self-study or ground/execution instruction. Document the identification
     and completion of additional training on the evaluation form.
     3.9.7. Restrictions. Evaluators may restrict certain portions of a qualified TCP’s duties.
     For example, a TCP could be restricted from certain duties until the TCP completes
     additional training to satisfy shortfalls noted in the evaluation. Document restrictions on
     the evaluation form.
     3.9.8. Rechecks. If a TCP receives a Q3 evaluation grade, a successful recheck must be
     completed by the end of the third month after the date of the first failure. The recheck is
     considered successful when the TCP performs to Q or Q- standard for each evaluation
     criteria previously graded U. If a recheck is not successfully accomplished in the required
     time, the TCP must re-accomplish prerequisite training events for an INIT evaluation,
     and pass a subsequent INIT evaluation. The test organization commander/director will
     determine the number of reattempts allowed during this period.
        3.9.8.1. The evaluator that administered the original evaluation will not normally
        administer the recheck. If a TCP receives two Q3 evaluation grades in sequence from
        the same evaluator, a different evaluator will perform the subsequent evaluation.
EDWARDSAFBI99-108 21 JANUARY 2014                                                               13


          3.9.8.2. The test organization commander/director must review the training and
          evaluation records of any individual who receives three consecutive Q3 evaluation
          grades.
4. Currency
   4.1. Required currency items.
      4.1.1. Control Room Event. Current and qualified TCP who go more than 180 days
      without executing a control room event will be considered non-current for a control room
      event. TCP who remain non-current for a control room event for more than 90 days will
      be considered unqualified and will require an evaluation IAW section 3.
          4.1.1.1. A control room event is defined by a minimum of one the following:
              4.1.1.1.1. The monitoring of a parameter or system for the safe or effective
              execution of a test event
              4.1.1.1.2. The conduct of a test card
              4.1.1.1.3. Directing the safe and effective execution of a test activity
              4.1.1.1.4. Performing TCP instructor or evaluator duties
      4.1.2. Aircraft Systems Certifications. Currency in Phase II certifications is only required
      for aircraft systems certification, not specialized certifications. Test organizations should
      develop currency requirements for Phase II specialized certifications where appropriate.
      To maintain currency in a Phase II aircraft systems certification, a control room event for
      the same aircraft MDS must be performed.
          4.1.2.1. TCP current in a Phase II aircraft systems certification who go more than
          180 days without executing a control room event for the same aircraft MDS will be
          considered non-current for that aircraft MDS. TCP who remain non-current for a
          Phase II aircraft systems certification for more than 90 days must re-accomplish the
          certification training.
          4.1.2.2. TCP who are also non-rated aircrew may use the “Sortie” aircrew currency
          item, defined in AFI 11-2FTV1, for the Phase II Aircraft Systems currency
          requirement of this instruction.
      4.1.3. Crew Resource Management (CRM) academics is required for all TCP every three
      years to remain current. This training will be facilitated by the 412 OGV (or a designee)
      or may be accomplished at another location by a 412 OGV approved facilitator.
          4.1.3.1. Individuals who have never taken, or cannot produce proof of CRM
          academics must complete the “initial” CRM academics. Recurring academics can be
          satisfied by completion of a “refresher” course. For guidance, contact 412 OGV.
          4.1.3.2. If done off-site, documentation (AF Form 1522 or equivalent) will be
          submitted to the test organization and maintained in the individual’s training records.
          4.1.3.3. Guest Personnel (paragraph 1.5.1), after making an effort to obtain CRM
          training via a facilitated method, may, as approved by the test organization
          commander/director, receive non-facilitated training from the test organization or
          from their employer.

     4.1.4. CRM Event. Required by the last day of the 12th month after the last CRM training
     event. The following are considered CRM events:
         4.1.4.1. 412 OGV facilitated CRM academics (paragraph 4.1.3).
         4.1.4.2. A mission in which CRM concepts are discussed by all essential control
         room personnel and/or aircrew during brief and/or debrief.
         4.1.4.3. An in-flight-emergency (IFE) during a mission followed by a CRM debrief.
         4.1.4.4. Dedicated CRM academics presented as a formal test organization training
         event.
     4.1.5. AFI review. Due on the last day of the 12th month after the last review. To
     reestablish currency for AFI review, TCP must document an AFI review prior to
     executing another test mission.
  4.2. Loss of Currency. TCP who become non-current in a required item will not perform
  control room duties unless under the supervision of a current and qualified instructor. The
  test organization commander/director may allow non-current DEs to be supervised by an
  instructor TC/TD.
     4.2.1. If supervising a non-current TCP, an instructor may perform CR duties apart from
     the required supervision only if the instructor TCP’s duties allow adequate supervision of
     the supervisee.
     4.2.2. If performing control room duties while airborne, a non-current TCP may be
     supervised by instructor qualified test aircrew in order to regain currency for a control
     room event or Phase II aircraft certification.
