           POLICY FOR WING AND SQUADRON COMMANDER MISSION
                       ACCOMPLISHMENT AWARDS

A15.1. Wing and squadron commanders may issue coins to deserving personnel who have
contributed positively to the mission accomplishment. Wing and squadron commanders should
maintain accountability of the number of coins they have issued, to whom, and for what purpose.
Coins purchased with appropriated funds may not be given as personal gifts or mementos. Coins
purchased for mission accomplishment award recognition may be presented to military members
for reenlistment as well IAW AMCPAM 65-603, Budget Operating Guidance, paragraph 18.9.1.
A15.2. Direction for this policy is addressed in AFI 65-601V1, Budget Guidance and
Procedures, paragraph 4.29.3.1., which states, ―There is no authority which allows the use of
appropriated funds to procure mementos (i.e., coins or medallions) for Air Force individual
military or civilian personnel or units if the reason for the presentation is not specifically
addressed as a mission accomplishment award published in a command or base instruction.‖
