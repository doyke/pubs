                                             Chapter 1

      RESPONSIBILITY AND OBLIGATIONS, FLIGHT AUTHORIZATIONS, AND
                       FOREIGN MILITARY FLYING

Section 1A—Responsibilities and Obligations

1.1. Who Must Comply. The policies and requirements of this instruction apply to all
personnel who fly onboard Air Force aircraft, and their commanders. In addition, it provides
guidance on the Jump Record Folder (JRF), Aviation Service Codes (ASC), and flight
authorization (FA) codes in Table A2.3 for Air Force parachutists. Further guidance on
parachutist policies and requirements can be found in AFI 11-410, Personnel Parachute
Operations.
1.1. (PACAF)Who Must Comply. This supplement applies to PACAF assigned and attached
aircrew and parachutists. It applies to Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), Air National Guard (ANG)
and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units when aircraft or aircrew are chopped to PACAF
or PACOM. This supplement also applies to members of other commands, direct reporting units
(DRUs), and field operating agencies (FOA) (assigned and attached) when performing crew
duties in PACAF aircraft or aircraft are chopped to PACAF (ANG/AFRC). Host Aviation
Resource Management (HARM) offices servicing tenant units will establish and review annually
all host-tenant support agreements IAW AFI 11-421, Aviation Resource Management.
1.2. Responsibilities of AF/A3O-A. The Director of Air Operations (AF/A3O -A):
     1.2.1. Establishes and monitors the Air Force flying program as outlined in this instruction to
     ensure effective use of resources.
     1.2.2. Assigns AF/A3O-AT as the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for this
     instruction.
1.3. Responsibilities of MAJCOMs. MAJCOM/A3s will provide oversight of MAJCOM
flying programs. MAJCOMs will establish a system to carry out the requirements of this
instruction and to meet training and operational needs of the Air Force.
1.3. (PACAF)Responsibilities of MAJCOMs. The Chief, Air Operations Division (HQ
PACAF/A3T) has the responsibility for administering the provisions of this basic instruction
within PACAF, and publishing the PACAF supplement.
     1.3.1. MAJCOM Commanders will prohibit any agency or unit from operating or
     maintaining an aircraft that does not have an established system program director. Waiver
     authority is MAJCOM/A3; coordinate waivers with MAJCOM/A4. Aircraft procured
     through non-DoD resources will not be flown or operated by USAF units without MAJCOM
     approval.
     1.3.2. MAJCOM Commanders may direct grounding of MDS-specific or all aircraft within
     their commands for maintenance reasons. When a MAJCOM has lead command aircraft
     responsibility, MAJCOM commanders may recommend grounding of all aircraft within an
     MDS-specific fleet. MAJCOM Commanders may also direct a stand -down of aircrew
     personnel when warranted by operational considerations, in conjunction with aircraft
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                     9


  grounding or as a separate action. A stand-down has no immediate impact on the operational
  status of any unit aircraft; it is the result of an operational unit commander directing unit
  aircrews not to fly for a specific reason. A stand-down provides the commander time to
  assess an incident or finding and actions required to safely resume operations. Notification
  will be provided IAW AFI 10 -206, Operational Reporting. See also AFI 21-101, Aircraft
  and Equipment Maintenance Management, for additional guidance. Return to normal
  operations will be initiated by the MAJCOM Commander directing the original
  grounding/stand-down. Authority for grounding and/or stand-down may be delegated by
  MAJCOMs in supplements to this and other governing AFIs, but not lower than
  MAJCOM/A3/A4.
  1.3.3. Interfly Guidance. Lead MAJCOMs will place interfly guidance (if applicable) in
  aircraft-specific AFI 11-2MDS-Specific, Volumes 3. As required, establish additional
  interfly guidance in MAJCOM supplements to this AFI. Interfly agreements must be
  approved prior to flight. Ensure unit coordination. Ensure required information is provided to
  members Host Aviation Resource Management (HARM) offices
  1.3.3. (PACAF) When not specifically established by AFI 11-2MDS-Specific, Volume 3,
  OG/CC is the approval authority for interfly on PACAF aircraft under their control. In all
  cases, interfly aircrew will be qualified in the MDS.
  1.3.4. Ensure no aircrew member is assigned Flying Status Code (FSC) ―S‖ (Table 2.6)
  (except Duty Not Involving Flying [DNIF] members) or ASC ―04‖ (Table 2.5) beyond 180
  days without being disqualified for aviation service, returned to flying, or reassigned to non-
  flying status/duty. MAJCOM/A3T or equivalent is the waiver authority for the 180-day limit.
  MAJCOM/A3 is the waiver authority to extend members in t his status beyond 365 days.
  Send information copy to AF/A3O-AT for all cases waived beyond 365 days. Note: For
  members previously in DNIF status, the 180-day period begins on the date the member was
  cleared to perform flying duties.
  1.3.4. (PACAF) HQ PACAF/A3TC will review and staff ASC "04," and FSC "S" waiver
  requests to HQ PACAF/A3T or A3/5/8, as appropriate.
  1.3.5. Ensure FSC ―K‖ (Table 2.6) is used only for aircrew members assigned to an active
  Aircrew Position Indicator (API), but not authorized to fly due to lack of resources (aircraft,
  flying hours, etc.). To ensure the requirement for active flying is still valid, each position
  occupied by a member assigned FSC ―K‖ must be revalidated by the MAJCOM/A3 at the
  end of each fiscal year. The member‗s commander will submit a request for revalidation
  through group channels for MAJCOM/A3 approval. Upon completion of the revalidation,
  send notification to the member‗s Host Aviation Resource Management (HARM) office
  authorizing the continuance of FSC ―K‖. Send an information copy to AF/A3O-AT. See
  paragraph 1.4.1.9 for additional guidance. EXCEPTION: MAJCOM/A3 revalidation is not
  required for FSC ―K‖ assigned to members deployed to a non-flying assignment.
  1.3.5. (PACAF) HQ PACAF/A3TC will staff FSC-K revalidation requests to
  PACAF/A3/5/8, and will notify member‘s HARM office and AF/A3O-AT of PACAF/A3/5/8
  approval/disapproval. Staff revalidation requests to arrive at PACAF/A3T NLT 30
  September of each year.
 10                                   AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


       1.3.5.1. FSC ―K‖ is not authorized when aircrew members are double billeted due to
       permanent change of station PCS or permanent change of assignment PCA actions.
   1.3.6. Review all cases when a rated officer with longer than 18 years of aviation service and
   assigned to an active flying position, or a CEA with longer than 20 years of aviation service
   and assigned to an active flying position, has not flown for 180 days and is not in suspension,
   disqualification, or DNIF status. Review will determine whether the member should
   be disqualified from aviation service, reassigned to an inactive flying position, or returned
   to flying.
1.4. Responsibilities of Subordinate Organizations.
   1.4.1. Commanders are responsible for compliance with the requirements of this instruction.
   Commanders will:
       1.4.1.1. Issue orders and supervise all personnel assigned or attached to their command
       for flying duties.
       1.4.1.2. Establish procedures to ensure all flights are reviewed for flight feasibility.
       Commanders may direct a stand-down of unit flying operations when warranted by
       maintenance, operational, or safety considerations. Provide notification IAW AFI 10 -
       206.
       1.4.1.3. Ensure compliance with appropriate instructions, and adequate crew preparation
       for safe conduct of flight.
       1.4.1.4. Verify aircrew members qualification before assignment to an aircrew position.
       1.4.1.5. Notify the HARM office within 10 days of the beginning of any investigations
       that may affect an aircrew member‗s aviation service.
       1.4.1.5. (PACAF) The Chief of the Host Aviation Resource Management office
       (CHARM) will brief commanders on the appropriate provisions of AFI 11-402, Aviation
       and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges within 3 days of being
       notified of an investigation that may affect an aircrew or jump member‘s aviation service.
1.4.1.6. Notify the MAJCOM/A3T or equivalent office when a rated officer with longer than 18
years of aviation service and assigned to an active flying position, or a CEA with longer than 20
years of aviation service and assigned to an active flying position, has not flown for 180 days and
is not in suspension, disqualification, or DNIF status.
       1.4.1.6. (PACAF) Operations Group Commander (OG/CC) will notify Operational
       Support Division (HQ PACAF/A3T) via memo when member has not flown for 180 days
       and is not in suspension, disqualification, or duty not involving flying (DNIF). Include
       recommendation for member to be disqualified from aviation service, reassigned to an
       inactive flying position or return to flying. Include proposed timeline for corrective
       action.
           1.4.1.6.1. (Added-PACAF) When an incumbent assigned to an active staff flying
           position does not fly for a year, the flying justification in the AF Form 480, Aircrew
           AFSC/Active Flying Justification is invalidated and the MAJCOM will convert the
           position to an inactive aircrew position indicator (API). If a commander requires a
           staff position without flight activity to remain active, submit a change request to HQ
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                  11


          PACAF/A3T with justification that validates the continued need to keep the position
          active.
       1.4.1.7. Ensure aircrew members that have been disqualified for aviation service have
       the appropriate disqualification aeronautical order (AO) published, even if the member
       may have already separated or was dismissed from the Air Force. Every effort should be
       made to accomplish the disqualification action before the aircrew member is separated or
       dismissed.
       1.4.1.7. (PACAF) In cases where the member has separated, or has been dismissed from
       the Air Force, the HARM will forward (via First Class mail) the Aeronautical Order
       (AO) or Flight Record Folder (FRF) to the address listed on the member's separation
       orders. If the address has changed retain the AO/FRF IAW AFI 11-421.
       1.4.1.8. Ensure aircrew members assigned FSC ―S‖ or ASC ―04‖ do not exceed 180 days
       in this status without obtaining approval from the MAJCOM/A3T. If an extension is
       required, the member‗s unit commander will submit the request for an extension/waiver
       prior to the 180-day limit. If a waiver of the 180-limit was previously approved IAW
       paragraph 1.3.4, the member‗s unit commander must again obtain waiver approval
       prior to the member exceeding 365 days in FSC ―S‖ or ASC ―04‖ status. AFI 11-402,
       Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, provides applicable
       guidance for suspensions/disqualifications. See paragraph 3.1.6.4 for additional
       guidance.
          1.4.1.8.1. (Added-PACAF) Commanders should coordinate closely with the
          servicing HARM Chief/NCOIC, explore all options and be fully briefed on all
          ramifications prior to selecting a course of action concerning any rated aircrew
          member or career enlisted aviator (CEA) who will exceed the 180-day limit for FSC
          ―S‖ (except members in DNIF status). If member is DNIF the 180 day-count starts
          the day the member comes off DNIF status. Commanders will provide justification to
          the HARM office at the 150-day point explaining why the incumbent will remain in
          ―S‖ status beyond 180 days. The HARM office will forward request for extension
          complete with full justification, Attachment 16, to HQ PACAF/A3T, 25 E. ST SUITE
          G-317, HICKAM AFB, HI 96853-5426 prior to the expiration of the 180-day limit.
          1.4.1.8.2. (Added-PACAF) Without an approved extension, the unit OG/CC must
          recommend flying evaluation board (FEB) action to the wing commander or
          equivalent for individuals who have been in FSC ―S‖ for more than 180 days (except
          members in DNIF status). If FEB action is not recommended, the unit OG/CC will
          notify HQ PACAF/A3TC, 25 E. ST SUITE G-317, HICKAM AFB, HI 96853-5426,
          and provide supporting documentation as to why the individual should not meet an
          FEB under the provisions of AFI 11-402. Do not use FSC ―S‖ in lieu of an
          appropriate aviation service code.
1.4.1.9. Unit commanders will obtain OG/CC or equivalent approval for assignment of FSC ―K‖
and provide the approval source document to the servicing HARM office for publication of the
AO. The approval document will contain justification. Provide an information copy to the
MAJCOM/A3. ( EXCEPTION: A member‗s commander will submit a letter to the servicing
HARM office directing assignment of FSC ―K‖ for return to aviation service as a result of an
FEB, or when the aircraft was deactivated and/or unit closed when the member is still assigned
 12                                   AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


to an active billet pending reassignment. MAJCOM/A3 notification is not required for these
exceptions. Use the letter approving return to aviation service as the source document to publish
an AO to assign FSC ―K‖ for members returned to service as the result of a n FEB. Use the
notification letter from the unit commander to publish an AO to assign FSC ―K‖ to members
inactive due to aircraft deactivation and/or unit closure.
       1.4.1.9. (PACAF) NLT 1 Sep each year, the HARM office will notify the OG/CC (and
       PACAF/A3TC for personnel assigned to the MAJCOM/NAF), in writing, of personnel
       assigned FSC "K". NLT 15 Sep each year the OG or WG/CC will request HQ
       PACAF/A3/5/8 revalidation for all personnel the commander desires to extend in FSC-K.
       Send FSC-K revalidation requests (AO, Individual Data Summary (IDS), Request letter),
       electronically to HQ PACAF/A3TC. PACAF/A3TC will staff to PACAF/A3/5/8.
1.4.1.9.1. In all cases, the HARM office will publish the AO, with explanatory remarks,
and file the notification memo permanently on the left side of the FRF. If required, the OG/CC
will submit a revalidation request to the MAJCOM/A3 no later than 30 September (see
paragraph 1.3.5). Upon receipt, the HARM office will permanently file on the left side of the
member‗s FRF all letters assigning FSC ―K‖ and all MAJCOM/A3 revalidation approvals.
   1.4.2. Commanders, including nonflying unit commanders, manage assigned aircrew and
   parachutist members and coordinate changes affecting aircrew members flying status and
   parachutist members jump status with the HARM office. NOTE: This includes all Air Force
   Reserve Command Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) flyers assigned to active duty
   units at gaining MAJCOMs.
       1.4.2.1. Commanders will manage rated and CEA aircrew positions IAW AFI 11-412,
       Aircrew Management. API 5, 6, 8, B, and D coded positions may be double-billeted and
       both members may actively fly for up to 30 calendar days. On or before the 30th day, the
       commander will identify which aircrew member to assign inactive flying activity, FSC H.
       MAJCOM/A3 may waive this paragraph to allow double-billeting and active flying for
       no longer than 180 calendar days. This waiver authority will not be delegated lower than
       the MAJCOM/A3.
           1.4.2.1.1. (DELETED)
           1.4.2.1.2. (Added-PACAF) The HARM will validate aircrew/parachutist manpower
           position assignments quarterly to ensure billeting complies with AFI 11-412, Aircrew
           Management. The SARM will coordinate position assignment and AO action with
           the HARM as necessary. SQ/CCs will assign personnel to a valid position within 10
           working days. If the SQ/CC does not assign the member to an active billet within 10
           working days, the HARM will assign the member an inactive FSC ―J.‖ Psuedo-8
           positions are invalid and considered API-0 (non-flying) positions. Active flyers will
           not be assigned to a pseudo-8 billet.
       1.4.2.2. Commanders will manage non-rated aircrew and parachutist positions IAW

  1.5.4. Pick up the Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF), Flying History Report (FHR), FRF or JRF
  before departing for PCS or flying/jumping TDY (ref. para 3.1.4.1). Members must ensure
  they have a copy of their current AO, IDS, and ARMS training summary, prior to departure
  on a jump/flying TDY. Members initiating parachutist status, scheduled to attend jump
  school, must give the HARM office a copy of their TDY orders at least 5 work-days prior to
  TDY, to allow processing of the initial AO authorizing jump status.
  1.5.5. Turn in the FRF or JRF to the proper HARM office (or notify the HARM office that
  the record was mailed) within 10 duty-days after arriving at a new duty station (includes
  flying TDY). Inactive aircrew members must also turn in the FRF and FEF within 10 duty
  days. If a member does not turn in the FRF within the 10 workday limit, the HARM office
  will suspend aviation career incentive pay (ACIP), career enlisted flyer incentive pay
  (CEFIP), or hazardous duty incentive pay (HDIP) (via a Military Pay Order [MPO]) until
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                       15


  receipt of the FRF for validation of qualification. HARM offices will consider mailed
  records as ―turned in‖ and will not suspend incentive pay for these members. HARM
  offices will make every effort to contact the member prior to stopping incentive pay.
  HARM offices will ensure FRFs/JRFs are inprocessed to the ARMS database NLT 10
  calendar days after receipt of the records.
  1.5.5. (PACAF) HARM offices will establish written procedures in a memorandum of
  agreement with the military personnel flight (MPF) to ensure flying/jump personnel (active
  and inactive) are identified and informed of the responsibility to deliver the FRF/JRF to the
  HARM office.
     NOTES:
     1. The losing HARM office will mail the FRF to the gaining HARM office if the
     member‗s next duty location is not collocated with the gaining HARM office.
     2. (Added) Stopping Incentive Pay for Failure to Turn In Flight Records. HARM
     offices will publish an aeronautical order to assign Aviation Service Code ―04‖ when
     stopping incentive pay IAW paragraph 1.5.5. Upon receipt of the member‗s
     FRF/JRF, the HARM office will revoke the suspension and retroactively restore
     incentive pay, if the member is otherwise qualified.
     1.5.5.1. Aircrew members and parachutists assigned to an inactive API code/duty
     position (after an active flying assignment – PCA or PCS) will turn in their FEF to the
     HARM office within five duty days of assignment to an inactive API code/flying
     position (i.e. API-6 flyer is placed in an API-3 position, etc.). The HARM office will file
     the FEF inside the member‗s FRF. If the member returns to active flying status, the
     HARM office will forward the FEF to the member‗s flying unit.
  1.5.6. Turn in medical records to the Flight Medicine Element (FME) within 10 duty -days
  after arriving at new duty station and complete initial medical clearance requirements prior to
  first flight or jump.

   active flying billet in a unit without flying facilities or aircraft.
   1.5.11. When aircrew members depart PCS or PCA, ensure sign-out from unit/base does not
   negatively affect Operational Flying Duty Accumulation (OFDA) credit. Aircrew members
   require at least 15 days on active flying status in a month to receive OFDA credit for t hat
   month. See Chapter 2, Paragraph 2.6, for additional guidance pertaining to operational
   flying duty.
       1.5.11.1. Aircrew members assigned to an active flying billet who are being reassigned
       to an inactive billet should make every effort to out process from their unit/base after the
       15th of the month to provide an opportunity to obtain the last month of OFDA credit (if
       flight requirements are also met).
       1.5.11.2. Aircrew members assigned to an inactive billet who are being reassigned to an
       active billet should outprocess from their unit/base before the 15th of the month to
       provide an opportunity to obtain OFDA credit for the first month of assignment in an
       active billet (if flight requirements are also met).
1.6. Flying Obligations.
   1.6.1. During Time of War. Commanders (including unit commanders) may order Air
   Force members on active duty to make flights in any aircraft. Members are not entitled to
   incentive pay unless placed on active AOs that require them to perform specific in -flight
   duties on a frequent and regular basis as defined in this instruction. Members are not entitled
   to such pay if the pay is suspended by the President according to Title 37 United States Code
   (USC). Members are entitled to flight credit IAW Paragraph 3.3.
       1.6.1.1. Members qualified on the aircraft in which they are tasked to perform in -flight
       duties log the appropriate aircrew certification code IAW Table A2.3 and flying hours
       associated with duties performed IAW Section 3B of this instruction.
       1.6.1.2. Members not qualified on the aircraft in which they are tasked to perform in-
       flight duties log ―O‖ or ―X‖ aircrew certification code (first character) and other time
       IAW Paragraph 3.4.5.
   1.6.2. In Time of Peace. Commanders (including unit commanders) may order Air Force
   members on active duty to make official flights when in the best interest of the Air Force.
   Aircrew members on active flying status AOs will receive incentive pay if otherwise
   qualified and flight requirements are met (does not apply to non -interference fliers on AOs).
   Rated officers and CEAs will receive OFDA credit if otherwise qualified.
       1.6.2.1. Military aircrew members who are properly qualified, meet the criteria of this
       instruction and AFI 11-402 for initiating aviation service, and are directed to perform
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                     17


     specific inflight duties on a frequent and regular basis will be placed on AOs and a flight
     authorization.
        1.6.2.1.1. An aircrew member not obtaining or maintaining qualification in a specific
        aircraft will be placed on the flight authorization for that aircraft only when his or her
        presence is required for accomplishment of the mission. (See also Paragraph 1.8.1).
        These members will log time IAW Paragraph 3.3 of this instruction.
        1.6.2.1.2. Aircrew members in a specialty not listed in an AFI 65-503 crew
        complement, who are not obtaining or maintaining aircraft qualification, may
        be authorized to fly IAW Paragraph 3.3 of this instruction when required for the
        mission.
     1.6.2.2. Non-aircrew members who are properly qualified and directed to perform
     specific inflight non-interference duties will be placed on AOs and the
     flight authorization but will not be placed on the AFTO Form 781, ARMS
     Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document. Refer to Paragraphs 2.12.4 and 2.12.7 for
     additional guidance. EXCEPTION: Non-aircrew members assigned to flying unit
     commander positions or unmanned aerial system (UAS) sensor operator positions may
     log flying time in assigned aircraft IAW Paragraphs 3.3.1.5.2 and 3.3.1.5.3.
     1.6.2.3. Military members not on AOs, and not required to perform duties or obtain and
     maintain qualification in the aircraft, must fly in passenger status, will be placed on a
     passenger manifest, and must fly on commercial or military aircraft with adequate
     facilities for transporting passengers. Refer to Paragraphs 1.9.4.7, 2.12.5, and
     applicable MDS-Specific guidance for further passenger guidance/restrictions.
     1.6.2.4. Commanders, including unit commanders, may detail by written
     orders personnel under their command to take part in aircraft flights operated by any
     foreign government accredited by the United States, provided the flights do not add
     additional expense to the US Government, and provided personnel are on AOs
     authorizing frequent and regular flights. See Paragraph 1.11 for additional guidance.
     1.6.2.5. Personnel not authorized AOs (as specified above) tasked to perform unique
     ground support duties at an enroute location or destination point that are directly related
     and essential to accomplishment of the aircraft or unit mission, e.g., a specialist or
     technician required to provide aircraft support or a security team required to guard the
     aircraft, may fly as Mission Essential Personnel (MEP). MAJCOMs may further define
     MEP in MAJCOM supplements to this instruction, but guidance may not be less
     restrictive than the guidance contained herein. See paragraph 1.12.2.2 for additional
     guidance, and Attachment 1, Terms, for MEP definition.
        1.6.2.5.1. The OG/CC (or equivalent) with operational control of the mission being
        flown authorizes MEP status. If operational control transfers, the OG/CC (or
        equivalent) who assumes follow-on operational control may continue/revise MEP
        status (coordinate changes with originating OG/CC). MAJCOMs may establish intra-
        command and inter-command guidance to facilitate this process. MEP may only fly
        on aircraft capable of carrying passengers IAW the provisions of DoD 4515.13-R, Air
        Transportation Eligibility. EXCEPTIONS: (a) MEP who are mission essential to
        aircraft launch/recovery may fly on aircraft not normally equipped for carrying
 18                                  AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


          passengers. MEP who fly under the provisions of this exception must be physically
          and physiologically (when required) qualified and must complete applicable egress
          training prior to flight. (b) Under exceptional conditions (e.g. national emergency,
          severe weather, earthquake, flood) MEP may be flown on non -passenger carrying
          aircraft if their duties are essential to the maintenance of the air craft at the recovery
          base. All steps should be taken to pre-deploy these personnel via other means of
          transportation, if adequate time permits.
      1.6.2.6. MAJCOMs may designate aircrew members who travel as additional
      crewmembers (not required for the mission being flown but required for follow-on
      missions) as MEP. Approval authority may be delegated below MAJCOM level.
          1.6.2.6.1. For AMC missions already in the system, the TACC Senior Controller may
          approve MEP status. MAJCOM Standardization/Evaluation Chiefs may approve
          MEP status for MAJCOM or MAJCOM-gained missions for evaluators assigned to
          the MAJCOM. Additional crewmembers who fly in MEP status may only fly on
          aircraft capable of carrying passengers IAW provisions of DoD 4515.13-R.
1.7. Waivers.
   1.7.1. For Combat Missions or National Emergencies. MAJCOM commanders may waive
   any requirements of this instruction when necessary to carry out combat missions or to
   accomplish missions flown during a state of national emergency. Provide notification to
   AF/A3/5 with a copy to AF/A3O-AT.
      1.7.1.1. (Added-PACAF) Wing commanders will submit waiver requests to the
      NAF/A3. The NAF/A3 will obtain Commander, Numbered Air Forces (NAF/CC)
      coordination and forward to HQ PACAF/A3T. HQ PACAF/A3T will review and staff to
      Commander, Pacific Air Forces (PACAF/CC) for approval. If the situation is time
      critical, telephone waivers are authorized, followed by a waiver request via message.
      Waiver of any requirement of the basic instruction, or of this supplement, due to combat
      mission or national emergency will not automatically entitle an individual to receive
      Aviation Career Incentive Pay (ACIP), Career Enlisted Flyer Incentive Pay (CEFIP), or
      Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay (HDIP), as applicable. The provisions of AFI 11-401, para
      1.6.2.8 must still be met to qualify for incentive pay. In lieu of compliance with these
      requirements, an approved waiver must be obtained from the appropriate waiver
      authority, prior to entitlement being authorized to any incentive pay.
   1.7.2. At Other Times. Unless otherwise specified in this instruction, AF/A3O-A is the
   waiver authority for this instruction. Request waivers through applicable channels to the
   MAJCOM/A3, or equivalent level. MAJCOM/A3s (or equivalents) will forward to AF/A3O-
   A, with a courtesy copy to AF/A3O -AT. Waivers to supplemental guidance will be handled
   by the MAJCOM agency that generated the supplement.
   1.7.2. (PACAF) Unless otherwise specified in this guidance, PACAF/A3/5/8 is the waiver
   authority for this guidance. Forward all waiver requests to HQ PACAF/A3TC for staffing.
   1.7.3. Administrative Procedures. MAJCOMs may publish HQ USAF waivers              in
   supplements citing the authority (e.g., HQ USAF/A3O memo, date, subject). See AFI 33-
   360, Publications and Forms Management, for additional guidance on waivers to
   publications.

Section 1B—Flight Authorization

1.8. Aircraft Flight Authorizations.
   1.8.1. Prior to all flights in Air Force aircraft, commanders (including unit commanders)
   issue written authorizations documenting all personnel required to perform in flight duties on
   the mission. Units will use AF Form 4327, ARMS Fighter Flight Authorization, or AF Form
   4327a, Crew Flight Authorization, as applicable to the unit aircraft. A commander's
   (including unit commanders) verbal authorization may direct aircraft flight only when time
   constraints or administrative procedures prevent written authorization. Written confirmation
   of this order must be issued within three duty-days. Once a Flight Authorization (FA) has
   been signed, changes to aircrew names and/or duty positions must be validated by a
   designated approving authority by placing the approving authority's initials by the line
   changed. The OG/CC or equivalent commander with operational control of the mission is
   responsible for the publication/maintenance/retention of the aircraft FAs for each mission
   flown by the aircraft. Only commissioned officers and officer equivalent government
   civilians in active flying positions are authorized to be authenticating officials for Flight
   Authorizations. FA authenticating officials will be appointed in writing by the OG/CC or
   equivalent commander. EXCEPTION 1: Aeromedical Evacuation (AE), Pararescue (PJ), and
   ANG Senior Scout unit commanders and properly designated authenticating officials may
   publish a FA for assigned aircrew members required to perform aircrew duties on the
   mission. Commanders or designated authenticating officials must ensure all members listed
   meet go-no-go criteria prior to authenticating the FA. The FA is not a stand -alone document
   and must be attached to the aircraft FA for the mission on which aircrew members were
   required to perform in-flight duties. If the AE or PJ crew is scheduled to perform aircrew
   duties on more than one mission, a remark will be placed on the FA to depict variations. As a
   minimum, the information in blocks 11 through 18 must be documented on the flight
   authorization. In the Remarks section of the aircraft FA, annotate the AE/pararescue FA
   number, date, and unit designation. The FA is a critical document used to validate aircrew
   member‗s duties/flight time logged on the AFTO Form 781. Officers or officer equivalent
   government civilians will be designated as FA authenticating officials in writing by the
   OG/CC or equivalent commander. Members properly designated as FA authenticating
   officials IAW this paragraph are not required to be assigned to an active flying position to
   perform                 FA                 authentication                              duties.
   EXCEPTION 2: UAS units will complete a preflight authorization signed by the aircraft
   commander to confirm go -no-go checks were completed. The authenticating official will
   issue a verbal order for the mission. The FA will be published upon termination of the
   mission and include crew members who flew on the mission, verbal order acknowledged in
   the remark section, and AC block initialed by the duty scheduler.
   1.8.1. (PACAF) For all PACAF units, use the Air Force Form 4327, ARMS Fighter Flight
   Authorization or Air Force Form 4327a, Crew Flight (FA) Authorization, or a computer-
   generated (GDSS, PEX. etc.) equivalent.          Flight Authorizations generated by these
   automated systems must contain all the required information contained on the actual Air
   Force form. These forms/formats will be used for all missions including those flown in the
   local area. Number all flight authorizations consecutively starting each fiscal year and
   maintain the numbers in a flight authorization number log. Maintain these forms IAW AFPD
   33-3, Information Management and AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records.

     1.8.1.1. Units will validate go-no-go qualification IAW AFI 11 -202, Volume 2, Aircrew
     Standardization/Evaluation Program, prior to authorizing members to participate in
     aircrew or operational support duties. Once a FA has been published, the pilot in
     command, or FA authenticating official if the pilot in command is not available, will
     validate go-no-go status for additional aircrew or operational support members prior to
     authorizing them to fly and adding or attaching them to the FA. Validation may include
     ARMS products IAW AFI 11-421 (or comparable database for USAFA airmanship
     programs), a FA from an AE, Pararescue, or Senior Scout unit commander (or designated
     representative), or a letter from the member‗s unit validating the individual‗s
     qualification to fly on required missions. Note: When preparing flight authorizations for
     missions scheduled on future dates, the aviation resource management specialist or
     designated representative responsible for go-no-go validation will confirm the members‗
     aeronautical order status and ensure currency (to include flight physical and physiological
     training) and qualification will remain valid through the scheduled flight date(s). The FA
     is an official document depicting what actually occurred on the mission. The original,
     printed, signed forms with changes annotated are required documentation. Reproduction
     and disposal of the original forms to remove pen/ink changes after the flight

        orientation flights
NOTE:
1. ―Orientation flights‖ are defined as continuous flights performed within the local flying area
and terminating at the point of origin (DoD 4515.13-R, Chapter 4). ―Note 1 N/A‖, means the
category of flight is not considered an orientation flight; however, it is included in the table as a
consolidated reference source.
2. Requests for point-to-point travel must be specifically addressed and approved by SECAF.
Retiring members of Congress and retiring congressional staff members may be flown on
orientation flights only upon the written approval of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for
Legislative Affairs (ASD[LA]). (Ref. DSD Memo, 23 Dec 1996).
3. When aircraft are ―chopped‖ or assigned to a gaining Combatant Commander, approval
authority will be the Commander Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) or Theater Special Operations
Command (SOC) commander.
4. Inform AF/CC, AF/A3/5, AF/A3O, AF/A3O-A, if approved.
5. Flights involving foreign nationals must be reviewed for foreign disclosure requirements and
political concerns. Foreign government officials are equivalent to U.S. Federal government
officials and do not include local government officials such as mayors, police chiefs, and other
local officials who do not represent a foreign government at the national le vel. Foreign military
"civilian equivalents" are comparable to DoD ―civilian equivalents‖.
a. Ensure foreign disclosure requirements and base visit requests are satisfied according to
AFI16-201, Air Force Foreign Disclosure and Technology Transfer Program.
b. Coordinate with the country director in the appropriate SAF/IA regional division (four-letter
level), before approval, to ensure no political concerns exist that would prevent the
flight. Contact SAF/IAR(_) on the Global address list at saf.iar_@pentagon.af.mil (blank space
is for regional division: Europe, Middle East, Pacific, etc.).

   1.11.1. With MAJCOM approval, aircrew members in active flying positions, and
   authorized operational support personnel, may perform appropriate duties in non-US Air
   Force aircraft if it is in the interest of the US Government, approved by the authority that
   controls the aircraft, the members are qualified or are authorized to receive training prior to
   qualification and, if applicable, licensed to perform such duties. Prior to authorizing these
   missions, MAJCOMs will ensure a valid requirement for a USAF aircrew member to
   operationally fly exists, which cannot be accomplished in USAF aircraft. For operational
   support flying, justification must show that qualified aircrew or operational support personnel
   of other (non-US Air Force) services or applicable organizations cannot perform such duties.
   Requests to fly solely for the purpose of qualifying for incentive pay or OFDA credit will not
   be approved.
NOTES:
1. MAJCOMs will identify approval authorities in MAJCOM Supplements. Authority may be
delegated below the MAJCOM level.
2. If the aircrew member is not assigned/attached to a MAJCOM for flying duties (such as a
Combatant Command with a geographic area of responsibility), the Air Force air operations
element within that organization will accomplish the MAJCOM function.
3. (Added) For members who attend flying training that includes flights in non -USAF
aircraft, the orders directing such activity constitute MAJCOM approval and satisfy
validation requirements for paragraph 1.11.1.. The member‗s servicing HARM office will file
a copy of the orders in the member‗s flight record folder as the source document for
authorization to fly in non-USAF aircraft.
4. (Added) Aircrew members will perform duties associated with their current aeronautical
rating and aircrew qualification, or when specifically authorized to perform mission-related
observation or evaluation duties. If a waiver        is required to accommodate unique
requirements, submit request IAW paragraph 1.7.2..
   1.11.1. (PACAF) PACAF/A3TC is the OPR for processing requests to perform in-flight
   duties in non-USAF aircraft. Approval authority is PACAF/A3T. Request must be received
   at least three weeks prior to the proposed flight. Requests not received within the specified
   time period run the risk of not getting approved. Blanket authorization request will be
   entertained on a case-by-case basis.
       1.11.1.1. (Added-PACAF) Qualified Pararescue and Combat Rescue Officer personnel
       (X-coded) are authorized to perform in-flight duties and maintain flying currency on
       foreign and sister service aircraft they are current and qualified on when in performance
       of their assigned duties. Current and qualified is defined as having a current physical,
       aeronautical orders, a current AF Form 4324 with Aircraft Assignment, a closed book test
       with questions covering the foreign or sister-service aircraft, and egress completed. For
       logging time on aircraft not listed on the member‘s current AF Form 4324, the member
       must provide a mission requirement letter (signed by the sister service or Foreign Flying
       Unit CC and approved by the CJSOAC or member‘s group commander) referencing the
       reason(s) the member was required for the mission and listing the member‘s current
       qualification in that specific aircraft. If not qualified, members must log ―XJ‖ and other
       time. An AF Form 4324 (depicting aircrew certification for that aircraft) and an AF Form
       1522 (showing egress and other qualifications) are required.

     1.11.1.2. (Added-PACAF) PACAF Flight Surgeons, assigned to an API-5 coded
     position may perform in-flight duties in non-USAF aircraft under any of the following
     circumstance:
         1.11.1.2.1. (Added-PACAF) Sister service, or other allied aircraft/crew where the
         local PACAF flight medicine element routinely provides medical support to non-
         USAF crew members IAW the terms of an existing support agreement.
         1.11.1.2.2. (Added-PACAF) PACAF Flight Surgeons participating in a joint service
         or multi-nation exercise (e.g., COPE TIGER, RED FLAG ALASKA) and required to

     assigned to the 18 AES are approved to participate in a C-130 training mission with the
     1st Marine Aircraft Wing (MAW) to maintain proficiency if all attempts have been
     exhausted and are unable to complete a flight for over 30 days on an USAF C-130. Back
     to back training flights in the Marine C-130 are not authorized unless another 30 days has
     elapsed.
  1.11.2. Performing duties in non-US Air Force aircraft does not remove military personnel
  from line-of-duty determination status. When aircrew members are not assigned to API 7 or
  API G coded positions, MAJCOMs will provide the member‗s HARM office with a letter of
  justification authorizing the member to perform official aircrew duties in non -US Air Force
  aircraft and log flying time IAW Paragraph 3.3. HARM offices will use this letter as the
  source document to assign an appropriate aircrew qualification code IAW Table A3.1.
  1.11.3. Orientation Flights in Non-US Air Force Aircraft. MAJCOMs may authorize
  orientation flights in non-US Air Force aircraft for individuals within their command who are
  otherwise eligible to fly on US Government aircraft. This authority may be delegated, but not
  lower than wing commander or equivalent level. Prior to authorizing such flights, approving
  authorities will ensure a valid requirement exists. Obtain approval from the appropriate
  authority that controls the non-USAF aircraft. The approving office will clearly indicate to
  the non-USAF controlling authority and the foreign government (as applicable) that
  acceptance of an orientation flight does not infer that the USAF/US Government will extend
  a reciprocal invitation to non-USAF or foreign government (as applicable) personnel.
  Individuals will not log flight time on orientation flights. Flights do not satisfy flight pay or
  OFDA requirements.
  1.11.3. (PACAF) PACAF/A3TC is the OPR for processing requests to participate in
  orientation flights on non-USAF aircraft. Approval authority is PACAF/A3T. Request must
  be received at least three weeks prior to the proposed flight. Requests not received within the

1.12. Requirements for Pilots in Dual Controlled Aircraft.
   1.12.1. Every flight in a dual-controlled aircraft requires two pilots with current qualification
   in the aircraft. Anytime an individual not fully qualified in the specific mission -design-series
   (MDS) occupies a pilot‗s seat with a set of controls, a current and qualified instructor pilot
   will occupy the other seat. EXCEPTIONS:
      1.12.1.1. If operational, command mission requirements, or MDS-specific instructions
      dictate that these requirements are not practical.
      1.12.1.2. To accommodate training programs for checkout or continuation programs.
      1.12.1.3. If the crew composition requires another rated specialty (such as a weapons
      system officer).
      1.12.1.4. To accommodate established programs (for example, indoctrination and
      orientation programs).
      1.12.1.5. Flight surgeons and MAJCOM-designated Flight Test Engineers who take part
      in flights in dual-controlled aircraft.
   1.12.2. At no time will an individual who is not fully qualified as a pilot in the specific type
   aircraft being flown occupy any pilot‗s seat (with a set of controls) with passengers on board
   the aircraft. For general officer flying, waiver authority to this guidance is AF/CC.
   EXCEPTIONS:
      1.12.2.1. To accommodate training objectives required by formal training programs. This
      exception allows passengers, who are an integral part of the mission (e.g., Pararescue,
      Rangers, CCT, SEALs, etc.) and when their presence is required by the training syllabus,
      to be on board the aircraft. During such times, a current and qualified instructor pilot will
      occupy the other pilot‗s seat.
      1.12.2.2. In order to accommodate training objectives or mission requirements, pilots
      (including non-current or unqualified pilots) and other aircrew members, when
      their presence is required by the training syllabus, authorized to obtain and
      maintain qualification in a particular MDS aircraft may occupy a pilot's seat for
      purpos es of conducting training or accomplishing mission requirements when MEP are
      on board the aircraft.
          1.12.2.2.1. During such times, if the pilot is non-current or unqualified, or another
          aircrew member is in a pilot‗s seat, a current and qualified instructor pilot will occupy
          the other pilot's seat.
          1.12.2.2.2. Pilots and other aircrew members not authorized to obtain or maintain
          aircraft qualification will not occupy a seat with a set of controls with passengers or
          MEP on board.
      1.12.2.3. Dual-control aircraft designated in the aircraft flight manual for single pilot
      operations in IMC/VMC flight may be operated with a single pilot on passenger -carrying
      missions when operational or command mission requirements dictate that two pilots are
      not practical. In addition, the other pilot seat may be used for passengers and/or MEP as
      defined and directed by the MAJCOM. Under no circumstances will a passenger or MEP
      be given control of the aircraft.
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                       35


       1.12.2.4. (Added) General officers not qualified as a pilot in the specific type aircraft
       being flown may accomplish aircraft delivery flights, under the supervision of a current
       and qualified instructor pilot, with MEP on board the aircraft.

                   AVIATION RESOURCE MANAGEMENT POLICIES

Section 2A—Flying Program.

2.1. Rated Officer and Career Enlisted Aviator (CEA) Flying Program. The rated officer
and CEA inventory requires close management at all levels to ensure a high state of readiness is
maintained with available resources. The authorized rated inventory includes pilots,
navigators/combat systems operators (CSO) and air battle managers in the grade of lieutenant
colonel and below. To manage these as well as other rated/CEA aircrew positions, API codes are
assigned to identify these positions. NOTE: API codes 1-0 apply to all rated officers, and codes
A-Z apply to CEA personnel (Table 2.1).
     2.1.1. Until the Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) is modified to maintain API
     effective dates and interface this data to the ARMS database, HARM offices will enter the
     API effective date in ARMS. Upon receipt and validation of MilPDS interface API change,
     enter the effective date of the API change.

        2.4.1.1. Use 1 June 1974 for officers rated before 1 June 1974.
        2.4.1.2. Use the individual‗s aviation service date for medically qualified officers and
        CEAs entering formal Undergraduate Flying Training (UFT) or approved local initial
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                     51


     qualification training (IQT) flying training courses where flying is part of the course. This
     date cannot be prior to member meeting qualification requirements IAW AFI 11 -402.
     2.4.1.3. Use the day after DDLDS from the losing organization for a PCS move that
     requires an ASC change. This includes inactive officers who require active AOs to attend
     formal flying training      TDY enroute to PCS to an active flying assignment.
     EXCEPTIONS:
        2.4.1.3.1. Use the day a rated officer or CEA UFT graduate signs in to the
        operational unit at the permanent base following initial qualification training to
        change the FSC from "X" to "A."
        2.4.1.3.2. Use the day after departing the TDY location where initial qualification
        was completed to change FSC "X" to "A" when an officer/CEA UFT graduate
        changed base locations to his or her first operational duty assignment following
        completion of UFT, then later completed initial qualification training at another
        location.
        2.4.1.3.3. Officer/CEA UFT graduates assigned to operational duty after UFT and
        then entered into in-unit or formal training leading to initial qualification in the
        primary aircraft will retain FSC X until completion of training as document ed by a
        flight evaluation, AF Form 8,Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, or AF Form
        8a,Certificate of Aircrew Qualification (Multiple Aircraft). The unit will submit an
        AF Form 4324 or an AF Form 1522 (documenting the basic qualification) to the
        HARM office to publish the AO.
        2.4.1.3.4. A previously rated officer or CEA returning to another UFT course will
        maintain their current ASC until the UFT class-start date. For example: Captain
        Lopez, a rated navigator with a current ASC of 1A is selected to attend pilot UFT.
        Captain Lopez has a PCS assignment to Laughlin AFB to attend UPT and departs
        Robins AFB on 5 Sep 05. The UFT class-start date is 15 Sep 05. The Laughlin
        HARM office changes Captain Lopez‗s ASC from 1A to 1U effective 15 Sep 05.
        2.4.1.3.5. Use the date an officer/CEA completes an in-unit or formal qualification
        training course (combined UFT/MQT) at the permanent duty station, as documented
        by an AF Form 8/8a evaluation, to publish an AO to change the member‗s FSC from
        ―U‖ to ―X‖. Publish an AO to the change the member‗s FSC from :X‖ to ―A‖
        effective one calendar day after the effective date of the AF Form 8/8a.
     2.4.1.4. Use the latest UFT graduation date to publish the ASC change from 1U to 1X
     (rated) or AU to AX (CEA). The UFT HARM office will publish the AO. For CEA UFTs
     without a formal graduation, use the effective date of the AF Form 8/8a.
     2.4.1.5. Use the formal jump school training (leading to the basic parachutist rating)
     class start date as the AO effective date to initiate Air Force parachutist service for
     members initially assigned to an authorized jump ("J" prefix AFSC or AFSC 1C2XX,
     1T2XX, 13DXX, 1T0XX, and 1W0XXC) UMD position. HARM offices may use TDY
     orders or formal training notification to jump school to process initial AO prior to the
     member attending training.

        2.4.1.5.1. HARM offices will publish AOs for parachutists to attend HALO (High
        Altitude Low Opening) school prior to the member attending school, effective the
        class start date. Member must be on competent orders for that type of jumping and
        AOs must specify the type of pay (HALO). HALO pay will not start until the member
        performs a HALO jump. Once the member performs a HALO jump, HALO pay is
        authorized from effective date of the AO forward (if otherwise qualified). If the
        member does not complete the course, HALO pay terminates on the day the member
        is disenrolled from class. A new AO must be published effective the day after
        disenrollment to reinstate Static Line HDIP (if member returns to previous jump duty)
        or previous ASC held (prior to the class).
        2.4.1.5.2. For members approved to attend a formal jump course prior to an approved
        assignment (PCS or PCA) to a "J" prefixed AFSC or jump inherent DAFSC, the
        HARM office will publish an AO authorizing jump status effective the class start
        date. HARM offices will process an AO assigning ASC 06 effective one day after the
        course completion date. Member‗s gaining HARM office will publish an AO
        authorizing active jump statu s again, once the member is officially assigned to the
        billet.
     2.4.1.6. Use the duty effective date for a change in duty that does not involve PCS but
     requires an ASC change (suspension/disqualification actions, flying waivers, etc.). For
     example: Member assigned to an inactive position approved for a Flying Activity Code
     (FAC) waiver to support a contingency or date a commander directs
     suspension/disqualification IAW AFI 11 -402.
        2.4.1.6.1. For inactive aircrew approved to attend a formal flying qualification or
        requalification course prior to PCS or PCA to an active flying position, the HARM
        office will publish an AO assigning FAC 6/E and FSC A effective on the class start
        date. For inactive aircrew deploying to positions requiring active flying, the HARM
        office will validate the requirement to fly utilizing the member‗s deployment order
        and publish an AO assigning FAC 6/E and FSC A for the duration of the deployment,
        effective on the member‗s report date or the member‗s training/requalification start
        date, whichever is earlier. All other uses of FAC 6/E must be approved by
        MAJCOM/A3. Approval authority may not be delegated below the MAJCOM level.
        (See Table 2.2).
        2.4.1.6.2. (Added) MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent function) will coordinate on
        assignment of FAC 6/E in excess of 365 days and on any extensions that would
        continue assignment of FAC 6/E beyond 365 days.
     2.4.1.7. For rated officers/CEAs required to perform air battle staff, airborne emergency
     actions officer, combat rescue officer, mission crew commander, RP, IIO, or other duties
     that do not fall under the operational support program, use the effective and termination
     dates of the duty orders to authorize FAC 8. FAC 8 terminates upon completion of flying
     duties. Rated or CEA personnel not already receiving ACIP or CEFIP are eligible to
     receive HDIP IAW AFI 11-421 for the duty period (if otherwise qualified); OFDA, ACIP
     and CEFIP are not authorized for these duties. Do not change the ASC for a rated officer
     or CEA. Assign ASC 9C for non-rated/non-CEA members who perform this duty.
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                 53


     2.4.1.8. Use the effective date of the new API code for a change from inactive flying
     status to active flying status or vice versa.
     2.4.1.9. Rated officers. Use the anniversary date (same month and day) plus 12, 18, 22
     (if applicable), and 25 years of aviation service when passing an OFDA milestone.
     2.4.1.10. CEAs. Use the anniversary date (same month and day) plus 10, 15, 20, or 25
     years of aviation service, when passing an OFDA milestone.
     2.4.1.11. Parachutists. Publish AOs only for individuals assigned to authorized
     permanent (UMD "J" prefix or DAFSC 1C2XX, 1T2XX, 13DXX and 1T0XX) positions,
     on temporary or permissive jump status, or for USAFA cadets enrolled in approved jump
     programs. Process commander requests to initiate jump status IAW AFI 11 -410. Process
     disqualification requests IAW AFI 11 -402.
        2.4.1.11.1. The AO effective date will be the date the member is assigned to a
        designated Unit Manpower Document (UMD) position that requires active jump
        status ("J" prefix DAFSC or AFSC 1C2XX, 1T2XX, 13DXX and 1T0XX) IAW
        AFI11-410 without a PCS change, or the date a member is authorized attachment
        to another US military unit requiring active parachute duty. The HARM office
        publishes AOs, assigning ASC 9E for jump duty only or 9D if the member is assigned
        to duty that requires both aircrew and parachutist qualification IAW AFI 11 -401.
        The AO must specify type of jump duty required and pay authorized.
        2.4.1.11.2. For an officer/enlisted member qualified for parachutist service who is
        authorized temporary jump status IAW AFI 11-410, publish an AO with a start date
        established in the commander‗s request letter and with a termination date not to
        exceed 180 days. For example, a qualified parachutist, currently not assigned to a ―J‖
        coded UMD position is approved to provide manning assistance on a Joint Readiness
        Exercise from 19 Jul 05 through 23 Sep 05. The HARM office would publish an AO
        effective 19 July 05, with a termination date of 23 Sep 05. AO remarks will reference
        approval letter justification.
        2.4.1.11.3. For an officer/enlisted member authorized permissive jump status IAW
        AFI 11-410, publish an AO with a start date established in the commander‗s request
        letter; the termination date will not exceed 12 months. Do not change the ASC or
        authorize HDIP.
        2.4.1.11.4. If a parachutist reenlists without a break in service, publish a new AO to
        change only the termination date. If otherwise qualified, incentive pay and badge
        creditable months continue through this period.
        2.4.1.11.5. Publish a new AO when type of jump duty changes (static/HALO).
        Member must be required to perform HALO duty to be eligible for the
        HALO incentive pay rate. This includes attending HALO school (reference
        Paragraph 2.4.1.5.1). If a member is in a HALO -authorized manning position and
        departs PCS to a position that does not require HALO jumping, publish a new AO
        authorizing static jumping/pay only.
        2.4.1.11.6. Use the day a member is no longer assigned to an authorized UMD
        parachutist position ("J" prefix, AFSC or AFSC 1C2XX, 1T2XX, 13DXX and
54                                AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


        1T0XX) IAW AFI 11-410 to assign ASC 06 (Conditional HDIP—Flying/Jump
        requirement terminated) at the same duty location. This includes members who
        retrain out of parachutist duties or members who are assigned to a unit that has no
        available jump authorizations (manning in excess of total UMD authorizations).
        2.4.1.11.7. Use the day after departed last duty station or jump school for members
        who PCS to a base without an available UMD parachutist position ("J" prefix, AFSC
        or AFSC 1C2XX, 1T2XX, 13DXX and 1T0XX) IAW AFI 11-410 to remove the
        parachutist from parachute duty and assign ASC 06 (Conditional HDIP—
        Flying/Jump requirements terminated).
        2.4.1.11.8. HARM offices will publish AOs for USAFA cadets and other approved
        Air Force members participating in jump related duties as part of the USAFA
        Airmanship Program. Use the effective date of entry to the USAFA Airmanship
        Program. The effective period of the AO authorizing parachutist service is limited to
        the period of training at the USAFA. Do not assign an aviation service code. Leave
        the ASC section of the AO blank. Neither jump duty credit nor jump incentive pay
        are authorized.
     2.4.1.12. Non-rated officer and non-CEA enlisted aircrew members. The effective
     period of an AO authorizing aviation service as a non-rated aircrew member is limited by
     the member‗s duty availability. The member must be assigned to an aircrew-prefixed
     manpower position on the UMD. For members initially beginning aviation status, the AO
     effective date is the date the member is certified for aircrew duty and is entered into a
     formal school where in-flight duties (not observation) are part of the course curriculum.
     Example: On 1 Jun 05, a member reported to the base for aircrew duty. On 15 Jun 05 ,
     the commander certified eligibility and assigned the member to an aircrew-
     prefixed manpower position on the UMD. On 1 Jul 05, the member commenced TDY to
     begin formal flying training. The initial AO effective date is 1 July 05. For in -unit
     initial training, the AO is effective when formal in-flight flying training begins after
     being assigned to an authorized aircrew position within a unit. For example: On 1 May
     05, a member reported to a base for aircrew duty. On 15 May 05, the commander
     certified eligibility, assigned the member to the appropriate UMD aircrew prefixed
     DAFSC, and notified the HARM office of in-flight training start date. On 20 May 05, the
     member began formal in-unit flying training. The AO effective date is 20 May 05;
     however, the initial training must lead toward initial qualification.
        2.4.1.12.1. For previous non-rated/non-CEA inactive aircrew members assigned to
        an active flying position at the gaining unit, HARM offices will assign ASC 9D
        (Active Non-rated Aircrew Member) effective one day after member departed last
        duty station, providing the member is qualified for aircrew duty and is assigned to an
        authorized non-rated/non-CEA aircrew "X," "K," or "Q" UMD DAFSC position, not
        occupied by another active flyer. If there was no PCS involved, use the effective date
        of duty (if otherwise qualified). See AFI 11 -402 for limitations on exceeding UMD
        manpower authorizations for non-rated/non-CEA aircrew positions.
        2.4.1.12.2. Use the date the non-rated/non-CEA aircrew member is no longer
        assigned to an authorized aircrew "X," "K," or "Q" prefixed UMD manpower position
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                       55


           to terminate aviation service and assign ASC 9J (Inactive-Restricted). This paragraph
           also applies to members approved for retraining.
           2.4.1.12.3. If a non-rated aircrew member reenlists without a break in service,
           publish a new AO to change only the termination date. If otherwise qualified,
           incentive pay and badge creditable months continue through this period.
       2.4.1.13. Operational Support Members. IAW AFI 11-402, use the effective date
       when man-months are authorized, not to exceed a one-month period.
2.5. Operational Flying Duty. Operational flying duty is flying duty performed under
competent orders while serving in assignments in which flying skills are maintained in the
performance of assigned duties. The Aviation Career Incentive Act of 1974,theAviation Career
Improvement Act of 1989,and the FY 1996National Defense Authorization Act established
months of operational flying duty accumulation (OFDA) required for entitlement to continuous
monthly incentive pay for specific years of aviation service. Current legal authority is established
in the US Code. Table 2.7 shows OFDA requirements for each of the establishing acts.

2.6. Transition Status Codes (TSC). Transition Status Codes were established to track the
OFDA requirements for rated officers affected by the Aviation Career Incentive Act of 1974, the
Aviation Career Improvement Act of 1989, and the FY 1996 National Defense Authorization Act.
Table 2.8 lists and defines TSCs. Figure 2.3 provides a timeline chart based on aviation service
dates and provides additional guidance to aid in determining a member‗s TSC. Table 2.9 shows
OFDA requirements based on the member‗s TSC.

2. Aircrew members assigned TSC "A" require 96 months OFDA at 12 years to receive
continuous pay until 18 years, and 120 or 144 months OFDA at 18 years to receive continuous
ACIP until 22 years or 25 years respectively.
3. Aircrew members with an ASD between 2 Oct 1979 and 1 Oct 1985 inclusive, who
accumulated at least 72 months of OFDA as of 1 Oct 1991, are assigned TSC "C".
Example A. If a member in this status accumulated 72-107 months OFDA as of 1 Oct 1991,
he/she was entitled to continuous ACIP until 18 years.
Example B. If the member accumulated 108-131 months OFDA as of 1 Oct 1991, he/she was
entitled to continuous ACIP until 22 years.
Example C. If the member accumulated at least 132 months OFDA as of 1 Oct 1991, he/she was
entitled to continuous ACIP until 25 years.
Example D. Members assigned TSC "C" with less than 132 months OFDA as of 1Oct 1991,
were reviewed again at 18 years to determine appropriate incentive pay action.
4. Aircrew members with an ASD between 2 Oct 1979 and 1 Oct 1985 inclusive, who
accumulated less than 72 months of OFDA as of 1 Oct 1991, were assigned TSC "B."
Example A. Members assigned TSC "B," with an ASD of 2 Oct 1979 – 9 Feb 1984 inclusive,
require 108 months OFDA at the 12-year point to receive continuous ACIP until 18 years.
Example B. Members assigned TSC ―B‖ , with an ASD of 10 Feb 1984 or after, require 96
months OFDA at the 12-year point to receive continuous ACIP until 18 years.
Example C. Members assigned TSC ―B‖ who did not meet the 12-year requirement, but
accumulated at least 72 months OFDA at the 12-year point, were assigned ASC ―5Y‖ and were
reviewed again at the 15-year point.

2.7. Rated Officer and Career Enlisted Aviator Operational Flying Duty. To control the
award of operational flying duty credit required by public law, HARM offices must assign active
operational fliers (FSC A) who fail to perform flying duties to a temporary status, FSC S
(Inactive-Nonperformance) effective the first day of the fourth month of inactivity. FSC S will
remain valid until: the member accomplishes an OFDA-creditable flight; is disqualified for
Aviation Service; or is reassigned to non-flying duty. Active rated officers and CEAs
recommended for DNIF are identified in ARMS by a physical availability date and code. When
the DNIF is expected to last more than 30 days or has lasted for 30 days, ARMS automatically
reports the member on the Consolidated Headquarters Aviation Resource Management System
interface as FSC G. (The FSC G is for reporting purposes only.) An AO change is not necessary.
Members continue to accumulate OFDA credit until FSC S applies.
   2.7.1. As defined by public law, operational flying duty is flying performed under competent
   orders by rated or designated members while serving in assignments in which basic flying
   skills are normally maintained in the performance of assigned duties as determined by the
   Secretary concerned, and flying performed by members in training that leads to the award of
   an aeronautical rating or designation. Rated officers and CEAs must attain and maintain, as a
   minimum, basic aircraft qualification in mission or support aircraft. One of the following
   indicates the need to fly:
         2.7.1.1. The assigned API code associated with a specific position.
         2.7.1.2. Assignment to a formal course of flying instruction.
         2.7.1.3. A case-by-case determination by AF/A3O-A when unusual circumstances
         dictate.
   2.7.2. The requirement for the Air Force to track the flying activity of rated members, other
   than flight surgeons and UFT students, is based upon the Aviation Career Incentive Act of
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                   59


  1974, the Aviation Career Improvement Act of 1989, the FY 96 National Defense
  Authorization Act (NDAA), and the FY 99 NDAA. These acts established the criteria to
  determine eligibility for ACIP. The requirement to track flight activity of CEAs is based
  upon the FY 00 NDAA. Title 37 US Code, Chapter 5, Article 301a provides curr ent public
  law guidance on ACIP and OFDA requirements.
     2.7.2.1. The 1974 Act set standards of minimum experience necessary to receive ACIP:
     at least 72 months (6 years) of operational flying completed prior to the 12th year of
     aviation service and 108 months (9 years) of flying completed by the 18th year of
     aviation service. Individuals meeting these requirements were, if otherwise qualified
     (medically and physiologically [if applicable]), entitled to continuous ACIP until the
     22nd year of officer service (using an individual‗s OSD), without meeting a specific
     flying performance standard. Members who completed at least 132 months (11 years) of
     operational flying by the 18th year of aviation service received, if otherwise qualified,
     continuous entitlement to ACIP until the 25th year of officer service. Those who failed to
     meet the standards were conditionally entitled to ACIP only through a minimum
     performance standard by flying an average of four hours per month (two hours for ARC
     members) while assigned to operational flying duties. In addition, rated officers with over
     25 years of officer service (grade O -6 and below) and assigned to operational flying
     positions were eligible to receive conditional ACIP.
     2.7.2.2. The 1989 Act modified the required OFDA months rated officers must achieve
     for ACIP entitlement. The new law established revised OFDA requirements of 108
     months (9 years), 120 months (10 years), and 144 months (12 years) from the previous
     requirements of 72 months (6 years), 108 months (9 years), and 132 months (11 years).
     The effective date for the new criteria was 1 October 1991. On 1 October 1991, the
     USAF began transition to the new requirement structure and rated members were
     assigned Transition Status Codes (TSC) in order to determine OFDA requirements. Rated
     officers with ASDs of 1 October 1985 and later were required to meet the 9, 10, and 12 -
     year OFDA requirements under the ACIA of 1989.
     2.7.2.3. The FY 96 NDAA modified the requirements rat ed officers must achieve for
     ACIP entitlement established by the 1989 Act. The new law established revised OFDA
     requirements for rated members who completed, or would complete, 12 years of aviation
     service on or after 10 Feb 1996. Rated members assigned TSC A must have accumulated
     8 years or more of OFDA months within their first 12 years of aviation service to qualify
     for continuous ACIP through 18 years of aviation service. Rated members who
     completed 12 or more years of aviation service prior to 10 Feb 1 996 must have
     accumulated at least 9 years of OFDA within their first 12 years of aviation service to
     qualify for continuous ACIP through 18 years of aviation service. Rated members who
     did not meet the applicable standard for entitlement to continuous ACIP remained
     entitled to conditional ACIP contingent upon meeting the monthly flying
     hour requirement.
     2.7.2.4. The FY 99 NDAA changed the way ACIP entitlement was computed for all
     rated officers. Previously, eligibility determination was based on t he anniversary of the
     Officer Service Date (OSD). The FY 99 NDAA changed eligibility determination to the
     anniversary of the ASD. This change did not apply to those aviators who had passed 22
     or 25 years of OSD and had ACIP terminated under the ACIA of 197 4.
60                                 AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


     2.7.2.5. The FY 00 NDAA set minimum experience levels required for CEAs to receive
     continuous CEFIP: at least 72 months (6 years) of operational flying completed prior to
     the 10year of aviation service, 108 months (9 years) of flying completed by the 15year of
     aviation service, and 168 months (14 years) completed by the 20year of aviation service.
     CEAs who meet these requirements and are medically, professionally and, if required,
     physiologically qualified, are entitled to continuous CEFIP unt il their 25year of aviation
     service and without regard to a specific flying performance standard. Members who fail
     to meet standards for entitlement to continuous CEFIP are entitled to conditional CEFIP
     if they are assigned to active operational flying duties and perform aircrew duties an
     average of four hours per month (two hours for ARC members) until they reach their next
     aviation service requirement point.
  2.7.3. OFDA Computations. To receive credit for a month of OFDA, an individual must:
     2.7.3.1. Be assigned to primary or corollary duties that require flying and perform valid
     flying duties which are authorized OFDA credit in the current month or preceding three
     months.
         2.7.3.1.1. (Added) After establishment of an ASD, ABMs assigned to OFDA-
         creditable ground based radar duties will receive OFDA credit for these duties.
     2.7.3.2. Be assigned to rated/CEA in-flight or similar RP duties while assigned FSC A,
     U, X, or Z for at least 15 days within each calendar month that earned OFDA credit from
     the current month or previous three months. Rated officers or CEA members assigned to
     an active flying billet pending a PCS assignment to an inactive billet should sign out from
     the losing base after the 15day of the month in order to receive OFDA credit for that
     month. They must have also performed OFDA-creditable flying within three months of
     the departure month.
     2.7.3.3. Have no more than 18 years of aviation service for rated officers and 20 years of
     aviation service for career enlisted aviators. NOTE: If required, members may
     accumulate badge-creditable OFDA months toward advanced rating criteria after the 18or
     20year of aviation service. See AFI 11 -402.
     2.7.3.4. Individuals initially assigned to flying duty (FSC A) or returning to such duty
     from a disqualified or inactive status, other than FSC S, receive OFDA credit from the
     date of assignment of an active FSC. If such individuals do not fly within three months of
     that date, the HARM office will retroactively change the active FSC to FSC S, effective
     the day following the date of initial assignment of the active FSC. Deduct OFDA credit
     which began accruing with assignment of the original active FSC and terminate
     entitlement to OFDA credit. Assign an active FSC when flying begins, effective two
     months before the date of the first flight. OFDA credit resumes from that date.
     EXAMPLE: Captain Wiggins is assigned FSC A on 19 December but first flies on 17
     April: On 20 March, the HARM changes the FSC A to FSC S, effective 20 December.
     Captain Wiggins accumulated three months OFDA credit for January, February, and
     March. (Do not credit December because Capt Wiggins was assigned an active FSC for
     less than 15 days during that month.) The FSC S action deducts the three months credited
     and stops further accumulation. On 17 April, change the FSC S to FSC A, effective 17
     February. This retroactive change restarts OFDA credit. Do not award OFDA credit for
     February (less than 15 days assigned), but award credit for March and April. Credit
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                        61


       continues to accumulate until the individual fails to perform for a period greater than
       three months
       2.7.3.5. When aircrew members who are actively flying prior to reaching 18 years (rated)
       and 20 years (CEA) of aviation service do not perform by the end of the third month
       following the month in which flying duties were last performed, change FSC to "S"
       effective the first day of the fourth month following the month in which flying duties
       were last performed and stop OFDA credit. Change the FSC to "A" again effective the
       date of the member‗s next OFDA-creditable flight. Do not award retroactive credit.
       EXAMPLE: Lt Ostrowski flew on 14 May and did not fly again until 18 November: The
       HARM office assigns FSC S on 1 September. Credit OFDA for May, June, July, and
       August. The HARM office changes the FSC back to "A" on 18 November. There is no
       OFDA credit for November because the member was assigned FSC A for less than 15
       days during that month. OFDA credit is not earned in September and October.
       2.7.3.6. (Added) Unit commanders will notify the servicing HARM office when an
       ABM assigned to OFDA-creditable ground based radar duties prior to reaching 18 years
       of aviation service does not perform crew duties by the end of the third month following
       the month in which crew duties were last performed. HARM office personnel will
       change the member‗s FSC to S effective the first day of the fourth month following the
       month in which crew duties were last performed and stop OFDA credit. Change the FSC
       to B effective the date the member resumes crew duties. Do not award retroactive credit.
2.8. OFDA Waivers. Operational flying duty requirements for officers and CEAs are
established by public law: Title 37, U.S. Code, Chapter 5. IAW AFI 36 -2110,Assignments, it is
Air Force policy that as many rated officers as possible complete at least 10 years (120 months)
of operational flying by the 18th year of aviation service, however not all officers will fulfill the
requirements to receive ACIP through 25 years of aviation service. For CEAs, Air Force policy
is to manage CEAs to complete at least 9 years (108 months) of operational flying by the 15year
of aviation service; not all CEAs will fulfill the requirements to receive CEFIP through 25 years
of aviation service. The Aviation Career Improvement Act of 1989 and FY 00 NDAA authorized
the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) to waive OFDA requirements for rated officers and
CEAs who are unable to meet their flying requirements due to reasons beyond their control. Ea
ch year, MAJCOM commanders may submit nominations for Lieutenant Colonels and below
and SMSgts and below to AF/A3O-AT, for Colonels (and selectees) to AF/DPO, and for
CMSgts (and selectees) to AF/DPE, for review and staffing to SECAF. To implement this
program the following procedures apply:
   2.8.1. Rated officers assigned TSCs A, B, C, and CEAs are eligible for OFDA waivers.
   Because TSC D and E rated officers were grandfathered to the pre -ACIA of 1989 OFDA
   requirements, they are not eligible for waivers. Candidate rated officers must have at least 72
   months (6 years) of OFDA credit to apply for a waiver. CEAs must accomplish at least 60
   months (5 years) of operational flying during the first 10 years of aviation service, or 96
   months (8 years) of operational flying duties during the first 15 years of aviation service to
   apply for a waiver. Officers and CEAs who have not accumulated the minimum number of
   months shown above are not eligible for waiver consideration. By direction of the SECAF,
   third gate waivers, for individuals to receive ACIP or CEFIP through 25 years of aviation
   service when OFDA requirements have not been met, will not be considere d.
62                                  AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


     2.8.1.1. When retroactive waivers are approved by SECAF for rated officers who obtain
     72 months of OFDA credit after the 12th of aviation service, members will be authorized
     continuous entitlement to ACIP from the month in which they completed 72 months
     credit. (Members are not qualified for continuous entitlement prior to meeting
     qualification requirements.) EXAMPLE: Major Farrell reached his 12th year of aviation
     service on 18 January 04 and had accumulated 60 months of OFDA credit, 36 months
     short of the 12 year requirement, and was assigned ASC 5A, conditional entitlement
     status. Effective 17 January 05 he accumulated 72 months of OFDA and applied for a
     waiver of his 12th year requirement on that date. SECAF approved a 24 -month OFDA
     waiver on 15 June 05 and Major Farrell‗s HARM office was directed to publish an AO
     changing Major Farrell‗s ASC from 5A to 2A and start continuous ACIP effective 17
     January 05. NOTE: CEAs are not eligible for retroactive waivers.
     2.8.1.2. For OFDA waiver requests submitted from the MAJCOM or equivalent, and
     approved by SECAF prior to loss of continuous pay, members will be authorized
     continuous entitlement to ACIP or CEFIP from the requirement anniversary date (if
     otherwise qualified).
     2.8.1.3. For OFDA waiver requests submitted from the MAJCOM or equivalent, and
     approved by SECAF after the loss of continuous pay, members will be authorized
     entitlement to ACIP or CEFIP from the date the member submitted the original request to
     the first office in the member‗s MAJCOM or equivalent chain of command (if otherwise
     qualified). See also Paragraph 2.8.9.
  2.8.2. MAJCOM commanders may submit OFDA waiver nominations only when the
  member failed to achieve requirements due to reasons beyond his or her control. Examples
  include, but are not limited to: banked UPT graduates, extended DNIFs, rated officers
  assigned to deactivating/draw down flying units or Air Liaison Officer assignments who
  cannot be placed into another flying position prior to completion of 120 months of OFDA
  credit at 18 years of aviation service, rated officers assigned to non -flying duties necessary
  to comply with the requirements of the Goldwater -Nichols Act (joint duty schools/follow-
  on tours) or the Acquisition Public Law, and CEAs assigned to inactive flying billets to
  perform UAS sensor operator duties.
     2.8.2.1. Officers and CEAs selected for highly competitive and nominative assignments
     merit OFDA waiver consideration, when those assignments are specifically responsible
     for rated officers and CEAs failing to accomplish OFDA requirements. Should such
     assignments jeopardize the achievement of OFDA requirements, place appropriate
     documentation in the member‗s personnel record. Documentation will include reasons
     why the member was assigned to a non-flying position (see Paragraph 2.8.7).
  2.8.3. Rated officers receiving acquisition bonus monies may not be eligible for OFDA
  waivers.
  2.8.4. Months lost due to time spent under flying status code K (inactive --lack of support)
  do not meet OFDA waiver criteria unless the officer or CEA was assigned to a unit
  undergoing draw down or conversion to an aircraft in which the individual‗s specialty was
  not required (i.e., an F-4 navigator assigned to a unit converting to single-place fighters), or
  when the unit aircraft was operationally grounded (paragraph 1.3.2). Individuals must meet
  both K code and draw down, conversion, or grounding criteria to be considered for
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                  63


  a waiver. EXCEPTION: Members in active flying assignments assigned flying status code
  K while deployed TDY to non-flying assignments IAW Table 2.6 are eligible for
  waiver consideration.
  2.8.5. (DELETED)
  2.8.6. Individuals who voluntarily turn down a flying opportunity or elect to move to a non -
  flying position which would preclude the possibility of meeting OFDA requirements are not
  eligible for OFDA waivers (except as provided for in paragraph 2.8.2.1). When an
  individual declines an opportunity to fly and is selected for a non -flying assignment,
  document this action in the member‗s personnel record, as specified in Paragraph 2.8.7.
  Reference the flying assignment that was declined.
  2.8.7. AFPC, HQ USAF, or MAJCOM assignment officers, as applicable, will document
  that the above situations existed at the time of assignment to establish an audit trail.
  (MAJCOMs will verify flying status code K criteria.) This may then be used to verify why
  OFDA waiver candidates were unable to accomplish OFDA requirements.
  2.8.8. MAJCOM commanders will forward OFDA waiver nominations for Lieutenant
  Colonels and below and SMSgts and below to AF/A3O -AT, for Colonels (and selectees) to
  HQ AF/DPO, and for CMSgts (and selectees) to AF/DPE. If submission is not warranted,
  MAJCOM commanders may deny requests.
  2.8.9. Submit OFDA waiver requests to the servicing HARM office no earlier than the year
  prior to loss of flight pay. HARM offices will staff requests to the MAJCOM. For members
  assigned to Headquarters, USAF, submit waivers through the individual‗s supervisory chain
  of command (A1, A3, A4, etc.), then to A3O -AT, DPO, or DPE; submit waivers for
  Colonels to AF/CVA prior to routing to AF/DPO. For members not assigned to an
  Air Force MAJCOM (i.e. members assigned to organizations such as USCENTCOM,
  USPACOM, or USSTRATCOM), individuals will submit packages to their servicing Air
  Force HARM office, which will staff packages to the MAJCOM that is in the HARM
  office‗s chain of command. As a minimum, the submission will include the member‗s
  dated request letter, Aviation Service Worksheet, justification for OFDA request, Military
  Personnel Data System duty history (SURF), and any other documents to support
  justification. MAJCOMs will coordinate with AFPC to ensure support for packages when
  waivers are based on assignment actions. Packages forwarded to HAF for SECAF approval
  must also contain MAJCOM/CC (or equivalent) indorsement. It is the responsibility of the
  member submitting the OFDA waiver request to establish adequate justification for waiver
  consideration.
     2.8.9.1. HARM offices will review the package for accuracy and validate eligibility
     criteria IAW this instruction. Review ARMS data/member‗s FRF to validate TSC code.
     Do not forward OFDA waiver request packages for members with TSC D or E. See also
     Paragraph 2.8.1.
     2.8.9.2. Commanders ensure eligible members submit waiver packages within the year
     prior to the applicable aviation service point for which the member requests an OFDA
     waiver.
         2.8.9.2.1. If a rated officer requests waiver of OFDA requirements, submit the
         package during: (a) the 11th year of aviation service for a waiver of the 12 -year
 64                                   AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


           requirement or (b) the 17th year of aviation service for a waiver of the 18 year/120 -
           month requirement.
           2.8.9.2.2. If a CEA requests waiver of OFDA requirements, submit the package
           during: (a) the 9th year of aviation service for a waiver of the 10 -year requirement or
           (b) the 14th year of aviation service for a waiver of the 15 year/108 -month
           requirement.
   2.8.10. Eligibility Criteria for Air Battle Manager OFDA waivers. In addition to meeting
   established criteria in this section (paragraph 2.8), an ABM must have an established ASD
   and be eligible to receive ACIP.
       2.8.10.1. (DELETED)
       2.8.10.2. (DELETED)
       2.8.10.3. (DELETED)
       2.8.10.4. (DELETED)
   2.8.11. AF/A3O-AT, AF/DPO, or AF/DPE will verify that packages meet eligibility criteria.
   AF/A3O-AT (or AF/DPO/DPE) and AF/A1 staff representatives will review packages. If all
   offices concur, nominations will be forwarded through the HAF chain of command to
   will be returned to the MAJCOM. Waivers will be approved only for the minimum months
   required.
   2.8.12. MAJCOMs are responsible to ensure each individual eligible for an OFDA waiver is
   considered for a waiver.
       2.8.12.1. The MAJCOM OFDA waiver process must include Operations Staff (A3) and
       Personnel Staff (A1) to ensure compliance with all applicable regulations and laws.
       MAJCOMs will coordinate with AFPC/AFCMO to ensure support for packages when
       waivers are based on assignment actions. Each submission must include the items
       specified in paragraph 2.8.9, above.
       2.8.12.2. Prior to MAJCOM/CC approval, MAJCOMs may send OFDA waiver packages
       to AF/A3O-AT, AF/DPO, or AF/DPE for an informal review. MAJCOMs will provide
       the initial review function. If the package needs revision, MAJCOMs will accomplish this
       prior to submission to HAF agencies. If requested, AF/A3O -AT, AF/DPO, or AF/DPE
       will provide a recommendation to the submitting MAJCOM staff with an assessment of
       the validity of each case.
   2.8.13. AFRC and ANG will develop initial MAJCOM procedures for reviewing OFDA
   waiver packages. Following MAJCOM/CC approval, forward OFDA waiver packages to
   AF/A3O-AT, AF/DPO, or AF/DPE for processing and final action.
   2.8.14. (Added) Individuals who receive an OFDA waiver are not eligible for a second
   OFDA waiver. For individuals who receive waivers, the specific eligibility requirement is
   waived for the member; members are not granted additional months of OFDA credit to meet
   the established requirement.
2.9. Taking Part in Flying by Rated Officers. Public law and DoD directives restrict active
rated flying to officers in positions that require members to maintain flying skills. If certain
SECAF approved mission requirements are more than the number of such officers locally
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                     65


assigned, a minimum number of other qualified members of the authorized rated inventory may
also be assigned rated aircrew duties.
   2.9.1. Flying duties are assigned in the following precedence:
      2.9.1.1. API 1 or 2 officers assigned to support the weapon system crew ratio.
      2.9.1.2. Student officers assigned to a formal course of flying training.
      2.9.1.3. Officers assigned to positions coded API 6 or 8.
      2.9.1.4. Officers assigned to positions at MAJCOM or FOA level or below coded API 3
      or 4, or non-rated (API 0). Assign such officers to rated aircrew duties on the basis of the
      most recent aviation service date, if:
          2.9.1.4.1. The assignment provides at least 24 months of local flying availability (12
          months at short tour bases).
          2.9.1.4.2. The flying assignment is to an approved operational support mission
          specifically designated by HQ USAF.
      2.9.1.5. Crewmembers will not perform flight duties while on leave, permissive TDY,
      non-flying TDY, or participating in an orientation flight, unless required to perform
      official aircrew duties. EXCEPTION: Members on terminal leave, who are otherwise
      eligible to fly, may perform flight duties and participate in orientation flights.
   2.9.2. Special Circumstances.
      2.9.2.1. If special circumstances require active temporary operational flying that is not
      IAW paragraph 2.9.1, MAJCOM/A3 may approve exceptions on an individual case
      basis (FAC 6/E waiver). See Table 2.2.
      2.9.2.2. If special circumstances require rated officers to perform temporary in -flight
      non-rated or non-crew (operational support) duties, HARM offices will assign FAC 8.
      For rated officers who were in inactive status, publish an AO assigning FAC 8, FSC J,
      and include in the remarks section of AO: "Rated Officer assigned to perform in -flight
      non-rated (or non-crew) duties." Officers performing non-rated duties will log aircrew
      certification code "Z" on the AFTO For m 781; flight time does not count towards OFDA
      or ACIP entitlement.
   2.9.3. Do not assign active flying duties to members scheduled for an academic instruction
   course of 180 days or longer. The HARM office will assign FSC L to these members.
   2.9.4. Reserve officers not on extended active duty (EAD) may be assigned to inactive rated
   positions (API 3 or API 4).
      2.9.4.1. Send requests for removing Reservists from flying to AFRC/A3TS (with copies
      to AF/REO and AF/A3O-AT) for approval.
      2.9.4.2. Send requests for removing ANG personnel from flying to NGB/CF (with a
      copy to AF/A3O-AT) for approval.
   2.9.5. (Added) Rated officers assigned to API-0 billets may fly on a non-interference basis
   when required. Incentive pay and OFDA credit are not authorized for non-interference
 66                                   AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


   flying. Members will not log flying time on the AFTO form 781. (See also paragraph
   2.12.4).
2.10. Flight Surgeon Flying Policy.
   2.10.1. To be assigned to active flying status, a flight surgeon must be medically qualified,
   physiologically qualified (if applicable), and maintain flight medicine credentials. To receive
   conditional ACIP, active flight surgeons must be assigned to an API 5 unit manpower
   document (UMD) position with Duty Air Force Specialty Code (DAFSC) 48XX, or 40C0C
   with an additional AFSC of 48XX, be on active flying status AOs, and be qualified in the
   aircraft. IAW DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 7a, Military Pay Policy and Procedures -
   Active Duty and Reserve Pay, flight surgeons are conditional fliers and qualify for
   entitlement to conditional ACIP by completing the prescribed number of operational flying
   hours per month.
       2.10.1.1. When a flight surgeon is assigned to an API coded ―0‖ position, the HARM
       office will terminate active flying AOs and assign the member ASC 8J. Inactive flight
       surgeons may be authorized to fly and log time without ACIP on a noninterference basis
       with unit training and flying schedules. Flight surgeons not qualified in an aircraft, on
       inactive AOs, will log only ―Other‖ flight time and include remarks on the reverse side of
       AFTO Form 781 (for example, ―Inactive flight surgeon‖, or ―Flight surgeon not qualified
       in aircraft‖). Paragraph 2.16.3 through 2.16.5 apply.
   2.10.2. A flight surgeon possessing an additional pilot or navigator rating and assigned to an
   API 5 flight surgeon position flies only as a flight surgeon, unless selected and approved as a
   pilot-physician or navigator-physician IAW AFI 11 -405. Pilot-physicians/navigator-
   physicians assigned to active flying positions (API 1/2) fly as line pilots/navigators. AF/A3/5
   authorizes exceptions upon request, based on justification provided by the Surgeon General
   (AF/SG). Flight surgeons who hold valid pilot or navigator ratings are entitled to conditional
   ACIP only; OFDA credit is not authorized, even when members are assigned to API 1/2
   positions.
   2.10.3. Pilot-Physicians Procedures. AFI 11-405,The Pilot-Physician Program, prescribes
   procedures for the US Air Force Pilot-Physician Program. Pilot-physicians remain
   conditional fliers for ACIP entitlement and do not earn OFDA credit. Except as noted above,
   active flying pilot-physicians will be assigned ASC 8A, FAC 9, and API 5, and hold DAFSC
   48VX. Retain members in ASC 8 beyond 25 years of aviation service. Credit flight time
   logged as a pilot towards advanced pilot and flight surgeon ratings (only when member is
   assigned FAC 9) and ACIP entitlement.
   2.10.4. Critical Care Air Transport Teams (CCATT) Procedures. Active and inactive
   flight surgeons may be tasked to assist CCATTs with patients on a mission.
       2.10.4.1. Active flight surgeons assigned to API 5 positions, with ASC 8A, are
       authorized to log crew position "FS" and primary time on all USAF aircraft missions
       based on their aircraft qualification.
       2.10.4.2. Inactive flight surgeons assigned to API 0 positions, in ASC 8J and tasked to
       perform CCATT non-crew duties, are authorized to log "FZ" crew position and primary
       time on these missions. Flight time may only be logged when critical care patients are
       onboard. When authorized, the member‗s HARM office will process the operational
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                      67


      support AO. Assign FAC 8, and include AO remarks: "Rated officer tasked to perform
      CCATT non-crew FAC 8 duties. Crew position FZ and non-crew HDIP authorized." The
      member‗s ASC remains ASC 8 J.
   2.10.5. (Added-PACAF) The HARM is required to submit a letter/E-mail to PACAF/SG,
   with an info copy to PACAF/A3T, each time an active flight surgeon exceeds the 60-day
   flight currency. Flight Surgeons exceeding their 60-day flight currency will be required to
   re-accomplish the flight surgeon qualification examination. Failure to accomplish the flight
   surgeon qualification examination will result in a go-no-go violation, and refusal to be
   allowed to fly. HARM/SARM offices will develop local procedures to track this
   requirement.
      2.10.5.1. (Added-PACAF) For Flight Surgeons remaining non-current for more than 30
      days, the HARM will submit a follow-up notification, at the end of each month, to the
      original addressees as well as the individual‘s unit commander, OG/CC and MDG/CC.
2.11. Taking Part in Flying by Career Enlisted Aviators.
   2.11.1. Flying duties are assigned in the following precedence:
      2.11.1.1. API A or B CEAs assigned to support the weapon system crew ratio, flying
      training instruction duty, operational test and evaluation functions, Foreign Military Sales
      (FMS), etc.
      2.11.1.2. Students assigned to a formal course of flying training.
      2.11.1.3. Career enlisted aviators assigned to positions coded API B or D.
      2.11.1.4. Career enlisted aviators assigned to positions at MAJCOM or FOA level or
      below coded API C or E. Assign career enlisted aviators API C or E aircrew duties on the
      basis of the most recent aviation service and be careful not to cause the member to fall
      short of meeting OFDA credit.
   2.11.2. Do not assign active flying duties to members who are scheduled for an academic
   instruction course of 180 days or more.
   2.11.3. Crewmembers will not perform flying duties while on leave, permissive TDY, non -
   flying TDY, or participating in an orientation flight, unless required to perform their official
   aircrew duties.
   2.11.4. If special circumstances require active temporary flying that is not IAW paragraph
   2.11.1, MAJCOM/A3 may approve exceptions on an individual case basis (FAC E waiver).
   2.11.5. (Added) CEAs assigned to API-Z billets may fly on a non-interference basis when
   required. Incentive pay and OFDA credit are not authorized for non -interference flying.
   Members will not log flying time on the AFTO Form 781. (See also paragraph 2.12.4).
2.12. Taking Part in Flying by Non-rated Officer Aircrew Members and Non-CEA
Enlisted Aircrew Members.
   2.12.1. Non-rated officer and non-CEA enlisted aircrew members (FSC D) are qualified
   personnel assigned to designated aircrew positions. Non-rated aircrew members are included
   onboard aircraft when their presence is required for the aircraft to accomplish its primary
   tasked mission. This is their full-time duty. When a full-time presence is not
68                                  AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


  required, operational support flying may be applicable (see Paragraph 2.12.2). Non-rated
  aircrew members will maintain flying class III physicals.
     2.12.1.1. Non-CEA enlisted aircrew members require an aircrew prefix of X (Basic
     Aircrew), K (Instructor), or Q (Evaluator).
     2.12.1.2. Non-rated officer aircrew members may be assigned to duty positions with an
     AFSC prefix of X (Basic Aircrew), B (Squadron Operations Officer), C (Commander), F
     (Flight Test), K (Instructor), or Q (Evaluator).
         2.12.1.2.1. When a non-rated officer aircrew member and/or parachutist is assigned
         to an authorized X or J (Jump) prefixed UMD position which is also a Commander (C
         prefix) or a Squadron Operations Officer (B prefix) position, the C/B prefix does not
         remove the authorization to fly or jump. Place the following remark on the
         individual‗s AO: ―Member occupies an X (or J) prefix UMD position‖.
         2.12.1.2.2. FSC J (Inactive) or L (TDY School) identifies aircrew members not
         assigned to active flying positions. AOs terminate authorization to fly and entitlement
         to incentive pay.
  2.12.2. FSC C (Operational Support) identifies non-rated/non-CEA personnel required to
  perform essential inflight duties that cannot be accomplished by rated officers, CEAs or non -
  rated aircrew members. Operational Support fliers may be required to perform flight duties
  on an occasional basis. However, their assigned full -time duties do not require them to be
  onboard the aircraft to accomplish its assigned primary mission. When the requirement to fly
  terminates, flight record responsibility ends. Authorized man-months are required prior to
  issuance of AOs. Process requests for operational support flying IAW AFI 11 -402.
  2.12.3. Aerospace physiologists (DAFSC 43AX), Human Performance Training Teams
  (DAFSC 4M0X1), and non-aircrew aeromedical technicians (DAFSCs 42GX and 4N0XXs)
  are authorized to participate in aircraft flights as observers on a noninterference basis.
  HARM offices will publish AOs according to this instruction and MAJCOM directives.
  Neither ACIP entitlement nor OFDA credit are authorized. Personnel who provide high
  altitude airdrop mission support qualify for Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay (HDIP).
  Paragraph 2.16.3 through 2.16.5 apply. Personnel who fly in support of high altitude
  airdrop missions will comply with AFI 11-402.
  2.12.3. (PACAF) Aerospace physiologists (DAFSC 43AX) and Human Performance
  Training Teams (DAFSC 4M0X1) will have a letter authorizing them Non-Interference
  Flying in PACAF signed by the WG/CC.
  2.12.4. Other non-rated personnel who fly occasionally to perform specific tasks (e.g.,
  administrative duties, evaluation of equipment, maintenance, passenger escort, security for
  classified documents, crew chiefs who perform duties on the ground at the final destination
  or points enroute and other duties not authorized as operational support IAW AFI 11 -402)
  may have AOs published according to this instruction and MAJCOM directives. Individuals
  in these categories will fly on a non-interference basis. Neither flying incentive pay nor
  OFDA credit is authorized. Paragraph 2.16.3 and 2.16.5 apply.
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                    69


       2.12.4.1. Members who fly on non-interference AOs will not be placed on the AFTO
       Form 781 (see Paragraph 1.6.2.2), except for those members specified in Paragraph
       3.3.1.5.2.
       2.12.4.2. Non-Aircrew personnel who fly occasionally to obtain familiarity with the
       flying environment or directed to perform specific inflight duties on an infrequent or
       irregular basis (Commanders [including unit commanders], Operations Officers, and
       supervisory personnel) may do so under the guidelines of Paragraph 1.6. Non-aircrew
       members assigned to flying unit commander positions may log flying time IAW
       Paragraph 3.3.1.5.2.
       2.12.4.3. (Added-PACAF) In PACAF, the flying category ―other non-rated member‖ is
       not to be used for the convenience of transporting individuals TDY or as a substitute for
       the orientation flight program. Examples of members who may fly in this status in
       PACAF aircraft may be SERE Specialist supporting personnel recovery/CSAR activities,
       intelligence officers, operations group or command chief master sergeants and first
       sergeant of flying unit/group who fly frequently with their units to obtain/maintain
       familiarity of their flying environment and of their unit members. Individuals not
       meeting the criteria above will not be placed on aeronautical orders.
       2.12.4.4. (Added-PACAF) OG/CC will identify in writing the individuals to place on
       AOs. OG/CC will validate the requirement to fly annually and the AO will not exceed 12
       months.
       2.12.4.5. (Added-PACAF) For NAF and HQ PACAF personnel, Non-Interference
       Flying will be used for established categories of individuals only. These groups must
       submit a plan outlining their need to be on the aircraft, complete with objectives and
       expectations. Submit your proposed plan to HQ PACAF/A3T, 25 E. ST SUITE G320,
       HICKAM AFB, HI 96853-5426 for approval, prior to requesting non-interference AOs.
   2.12.5. Aircrew members not formally entered into Initial Qualification Training will fly
   under orientation flight guidelines of Paragraph 1.9.4.7.
   2.12.6. Performance of flying duties is not authorized while on leave, permissive TDY, non -
   flying TDY, or participating in an orientation flight, unless individuals are required to
   perform their official aircrew duties.
   2.12.7. UAS sensor operators are authorized to participate in UAS aircraft flights as non -
   aircrew members. HARM offices will publish AOs according to this instruction and
   MAJCOM directives authorizing the performance of sensor operator duties. Neither HDIP
   entitlement nor OFDA credit are authorized. Non-aircrew members assigned to UAS sensor
   operator positions may log flying time IAW Paragraph 3.3.1.5.3.

Section 2B—Supervisory Operational Flying Positions

2.13. Supervisory Position Criteria. To conserve available resources, clearly identify rated
officers and CEA supervisory positions (API 6, 8, B, or D) that require the incumbent to actively
fly.
2.14. Supervisory Flying.
70                                  AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


  2.14.1. Rated officer and CEA supervisory flying is necessary to ensure that appropriate
  rated staff officers maintain a current and comprehensive background in the overall flying
  operations of the organization. Although occasional indoctrination flights normally maintain
  inactive rated staff officers and career enlisted aviators at an acceptable level of experience
  for their jobs, it is Air Force policy that key supervisors must actively maintain their basic
  flying skills to provide them with expert awareness of the unit mission.
     2.14.1.1. (Added-PACAF) Rated supervisors. Defined as commanders (including unit
     commanders)/key supervisors (OG/CD, unit DO) (API 6 and 8) are authorized to perform
     aircrew duties in any aircraft under their control for the purpose of supervising or
     observing flying training programs. Additionally, OG Superintendents who are on
     aeronautical orders, are current and qualified in an aircraft and assigned to a base with
     CEA/multi crew aircraft may fly under this paragraph. AFI 11-401, 3.7.1, also applies.
         2.14.1.1.1. (Added-PACAF) With the exception of COMPACAF, rated supervisors
         unqualified in fighter aircraft will not fly in the front seat of the aircraft.
         2.14.1.1.2. (Added-PACAF) Mobility and rotary-wing aircraft: Rated supervisors
         unqualified in the aircraft are authorized to fly a primary crew position but must meet
         the following criteria:
             2.14.1.1.2.1. (Added-PACAF) Fly with          an   IP,   and   a   complete    crew
             complement.
             2.14.1.1.2.2. (Added-PACAF) Attend a senior officer orientation course. If one
             doesn‘t exist receive in-unit aircraft familiarization training, and complete all
             required Aircrew Flight Equipment training for that aircraft.
             2.14.1.1.2.3. (Added-PACAF) OG Superintendents will not fly in a primary
             crew position on any aircraft they are not qualified in.
  2.14.2. Perform supervisory flying to the maximum extent possible in primary mission
  aircraft inventory (PMAI) associated with the position. When PMAI resources are not
  available or not practical to use, and maintenance of flying skills is mandatory, perform
  supervisory flying in the most cost-effective aircraft available.
  2.14.3. Commanders (including unit commanders) authorized to designate rated and CEA
  supervisory positions must minimize the impact of such flying and designate AP I 6, 8, B, or
  D positions only when active flying is essential for mission accomplishment. Designating
  authorities are:
     2.14.3.1. General Officer. The Chief of Staff designates general officer operational
     flying positions. MAJCOM commanders may manage assigned general officer
     operational flying positions above wing level to meet command requirements. Notify
     AF/A3/5 when a status change is made (send an info copy to AF/A3O-AT and AF/DPG).
     MAJCOMs are not authorized to increase the number of general officer operational fliers
     without the Chief of Staff‗s approval. MAJCOMs desiring to add operational fliers must
     submit a request for a change of status to AF/A3/5. AF/A3/5 will coordinate changes
     with AF/DPG. All requests for general officer operational flying training must be
     coordinated with AF/DPG. See paragraph 2.16.1 and Table 2.11 for additional
     guidance on general officer indoctrination fliers.

NOTE:
1. Combatant Commanders may determine their flying status, based on requirements. Notify
AF/A3/5 of status, with info copy to AF/A3O -AT and AF/DPG.
2. The Chief of Staff will determine the status of the AF/CC position.
3. (Added) MAJCOMs may determine the flying status of general officers assigned within their
command, utilizing the available AF/CC -approved operational positions within the command.
This option applies to all approved operational flying positions above wing comma nder.
Current approved positions are shown in Table with most recent HAF authorized status ( May
not reflect actual status if a MAJCOM change has been made). If a change is made, notify
AF/A3/5 with an info copy to AF/A3O-AT and AF/DPG.

4. (Added) Wing Commander applies to commanders of flying wings (and includes
expeditionary flying wings). Air base and support wing commanders are specifically excluded.
5. (Added) Current list of approved general officer operational flying positions is maintained
on file in AF/A3O-AT. AF/A3O-AT maintains records of approval for all general officer
operational flying positions.
6. (Added) Individuals (O-6) in currently authorized operational flying positions who have been
selected for promotion to the grade of Brigadier General may continue to fly operationally while
assigned to their current flying position.
       2.14.3.2. Colonel. MAJCOMs designate colonel active flying positions (API 6/8) by
       forwarding AF Form 480, Aircrew AFSC/Active Flying Justification, to AF/DPO for
       review and approval (see AFI 38-201, Determining Manpower Requirements). Colonel
       flying positions will be limited to individuals who directly supervise aircraft flying
       operations, flight safety, standardization/evaluation programs, and operational readiness
       inspection programs. Should positions not warrant full time flying, there may be
       justification for the individual to participate in the indoctrination flying program.
       2.14.3.3. Lieutenant Colonel and Below.           MAJCOMs designate Lt Colonel-and-
       below rated officer and CEA positions that require active flying IAW AFI 38 -201.
       If the position requires an AF Form 480, provide justification for flying on the form.
       Normally, API 8/D positions (NAF/FOA/DRU/MAJCOM) are authorized only in safety,
       inspector general, and standardization/evaluation functional areas in which flying is a
       requirement associated with the position. On occasion, justification may exist for an
       aircrew member to fly while in inactive status; see Paragraph 2.17.
           2.14.3.3.1. (Added-PACAF) Submit all Authorization Change Requests (ACRs) for
           API 3, 4, 6 and 8 positions to Manpower and Organization Division (HQ
           PACAF/A1M), 25 E. ST SUITE F-214, HICKAM AFB, HI 96853, and coordinate
           through HQ PACAF/A3T and appropriate NAF for review. An AF Form 480,
           Aircrew AFSC/Active Flying Justification, must accompany these ACRs and fully
           justifying rated expertise in supervisory positions. Base active (API 6/8) or inactive
           (API 3/4) flying status solely on job requirements, not on individual needs or aircraft
           support capability.
2.15. Supervisory Position Limitations. MAJCOMs will establish procedures to review API
6, 8, B, and D supervisory flying positions when incumbents are assigned FSC K (lack of
support) and when adequate support will not be available within six months. Where practical,
convert such positions to API 3, 4, C or E.
2.15. (PACAF)PACAF HARM s will review all API 6, 8, B, and D flyers in inactive status
due to lack of support (FSC ―K‖) quarterly. The HARM will audit the Unit Manpower
Document, or other source document to verify these positions. Forward the names of inactive
API 6, 8, B, and D incumbents to HQ PACAF/A3T, 25 E. ST SUITE G-317, HICKAM AFB, HI
96853-5426 to be considered for conversion to API 3, 4, C, or E positions in accordance with the
basic instruction.
2.16. Indoctrination Flying. Rated officers and CEAs in inactive status who are required to
perform operational flying on a temporary basis to complete a specific official task (for example,
to evaluate an operational flying procedure, review flying training effectiveness, take part in a
 74                                  AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


flying exercise or test program, or become familiar with a specific operational weapon system
and procedure) may be authorized indoctrination flying status. The following policy applies:
   2.16.1. MAJCOMs (or MAJCOM equivalents) select and authorize rated staff and CEA
   positions for indoctrination flying. Indoctrination flying allows inflight observations of
   mission equipment or procedures that will benefit the organization. Incumbents must request
   to fly. Take a conservative approach in designating these positions. MAJCOMs (or
   MAJCOM equivalents) will establish procedures for approval of indoctrination flying in
   accordance with Table 2.11. MAJCOMs will identify the incumbent by assigning FSC T.
   MAJCOMs may not increase the number of general officer indoctrination fliers without
   AF/CC approval.
       2.16.1.1. (Added-PACAF) In PACAF, due to limited crewmember training
       opportunities and flying hours, it is essential for commanders to personally review each
       request to ensure it is in the best interest of the command. Forward requests for
       indoctrination flying, with supporting rationale, through appropriate channels. PACAF
       units submit request to HQ PACAF/A3T, 25 E. ST SUITE G-317, HICKAM AFB, HI
       96853-5426, through the NAF/A3.              PACOM units submit requests to HQ
       PACAF/A3/5/8, through HQ USPACOM/J3. Incumbents of indoctrination flying
       positions not within PACAF or those above NAF level request indoctrination support
       through the appropriate NAF/A3. Individuals at NAF level may fly in other than NAF
       assigned aircraft with the concurrence of the NAF commander concerned. Individuals at
       wing level will fly in wing assigned aircraft only (HQ PACAF/A3T may approve
       exceptions on a case-by-case basis). Requests will be forwarded through channels to
       arrive at HQ PACAF/A3T, 25 E. ST SUITE G-317, HICKAM AFB, HI 96853-5426, at
       least 30 days prior to first flight. The HARM will not assign FSC ―T‖ to an inactive flyer
       without written approval from PACAF/A3/5/8.
       2.16.1.2. (Added-PACAF) Incumbents of the following positions, if rated officers, are
       authorized indoctrination flying: HQ PACAF/IG/IGI/IGO, HQ PACAF/A1, HQ
       PACAF/SE/SEF, 13 AF/SE, 36WG/CC/CV, 36 OSS/DO, 497CTS/DO, 8 OSS/EWO, 18
       OSS/EWO, 35 OSS/EWO, 51 OSS/EWO and 354 OSS/EWO. Incumbents will be
       identified with flying status code (FSC) ―T‖.
   2.16.2. MAJCOM commanders must approve the use of command aircraft resources to
   support indoctrination flying for personnel outside their commands. Authorization may be
   delegated, but not lower than MAJCOM level.
   2.16.3. MAJCOMs must ensure individuals complete, before flight, adequate training on
   emergency procedures, life support equipment, and aircraft systems. Individuals must be
   physically and, where required, physiologically qualified.
   2.16.4. Indoctrination flights in inactive status do not entitle the member to OFDA credit or
   incentive pay and do not allow authority to change ASCs except to assign FSC T.
   MAJCOMs will ensure indoctrination flying does not impact unit training, and will not
   increase command flying hour allocations.
   2.16.5. Obtaining or maintaining aircraft qualification while in inactive status is not
   authorized. Individuals flying in inactive status may not act as pilot in command and flights
   in single-place aircraft are specifically prohibited. Document indoctrination flights on the
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                     75


   AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document using Other flight time,
   IAW Paragraph 3.4.5.
   2.16.6. (Added) MAJCOMs may authorize indoctrination flying for individuals assigned to
   active operational flying positions. Do not change FSC.
   2.16.7. (Added) Indoctrination flying is not authorized for individuals assigned to API 0 or
   Z coded positions. EXCEPTION: MAJCOMs may authorize indoctrination flying for CEAs
   assigned to 9G100 positions, and for individuals tasked to perform indoctrination flying
   duties while deployed.
   2.16.7. (PACAF) General officers who perform rated and Airborne Emergency Action
   Officer (AEAO) duties on a flight will use the two flight authorizations duty codes reflecting
   the flight time performed in each position (rated/non-crew). For rated duties, log flight
   authorization duty character code IAW AFI 11-401, Table A2.3 that indicates the general‘s
   flying status. For AEAO duties log the flight authorization duty ―FZ‖.
   2.16.8. (Added-PACAF) Prior to flight, all indoctrination fliers will complete orientation
   flight Aircrew Life Support training according to AFI 11-301, Vol 1., PACAF Sup 1,
   Aircrew Flight Equipment Program, and cockpit familiarization training. Indoctrination
   flyers will occupy the jump seat, additional crew member seats or the rear cock pit position.
   PACAF/A3/5/8 is the approval authority to allow indoctrination flyers to fly in a pilot
   position. Approved flyers must accomplish a Bold Face/Critical Action Procedures (CAP)
   test (if applicable) and situational emergency procedures training (SEPT) with an instructor
   pilot as established in the applicable training directives. A cockpit procedural trainer or in-
   cockpit review session may be substituted for the simulator. This training is valid for 30
   days.

Section 2C—Flight Management Administration

2.17. Host Aviation Resource Management Office. The host command of the Air Force base
designates within the operations group a HARM office function to be the base OPR for ARMS
and for FRF/JRF management of all aircrew/parachutists on base or in the locale (regardless of
MAJCOM). (EXCEPTION: For ANG units not associated with active duty units, the ANG
Wing/GSU Commander will appoint an ANG HARM office for management of ANG flight
records.) The Wing/Group HARM Chief will be the senior or most qualified person, with a
primary AFSC of 1C072, 1C092, 1C000, or civilian equivalent. The individual appointed to this
position will have a minimum of three years experience in the Aviation Resource Management
career field, and obtained/maintained Special Experience Identifier (066). (Waiver requests to
these qualification requirements must be submitted to the MAJCOM functional manager with
documentation of member‗s qualification [copy of 1C0X2 training record documenting AO task
certification], and expected get well date.) HARM offices will be manned according to Air Force
Manpower Standard (AFMS) 13C1, OFPP Policy Letter 92-1, and the Defense Reform Initiative
Directive (DRID) 20. (EXCEPTION: Air National Guard Wing/Group HARM offices will be
manned IAW NGB/OL manpower standards for specific MDS or missio n.) HARM positions are
inherently governmental and only qualified 1C0X2 personnel (and government equivalent) will
operate ARMS for the purpose of processing aviation/parachutist service entitlement actions, or
monitoring and validating entitlement to flight/parachutist incentive pay
   2.17.1. Prepare AOs according to Attachment 3 of this instruction and AFI 11-402.
   2.17.2. Maintain all FRFs/JRFs according to this instruction, AFI 11 -410, Personnel
   Parachute Operations, AFI         11-421, Aviation Resource Management, AFPD 33-3,
   Information Management, and AFMAN 37-123, Management of Records, and dispose of
   records in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS), located at
   https://afrims.amc.af.mil. Maintain all FRFs/JRFs at the HARM office nearest to where the
   aircrew member maintains personnel, finance, and if possible, medical records.
   (EXCEPTION: All inactive IMA FRFs/JRFs will be maintained by AFRC/RMG.) To ensure
   proper aviation or parachutist incentive pay validation and prevent interruptions in the
   MilPDS to ARMS interface, FRF/JRF management will not change for TDY periods of less
   than 90 days. For formal courses where the member will accomplish flight/jump
   activity, provide to the TDY unit a TDY/Formal Flying Processing Checklist and
   ARMS training products IAW AFI 11-421. If the member‗s personnel and finance records
   are maintained at different locations, the HARM office located nearest to where the
   finance records are maintained will manage the member‗s FRF. With the concurrence of
   both HARM offices (and MAJCOMs if different), and with MOAs in place, FRFs of attached
   flyers may be kept at the attached HARM office. Request exceptions to this policy from
   AF/A3O-AT.
   2.17.3. Obtain medical information from the FME. The FME will provide the initial
   notification to the HARM office when required periodic physical examinations are
   completed, or when there are changes to an individual‗s medical status that affect flying
   duty. Suspense is one duty day.

       Medical Recommendations for Flying or Special Operational Duty ) to the HARM office
       within 10 duty-days. If the medical examination is incomplete due to reasons beyond the
       member‗s control, the appropriate medical waiver authority may extend certification to
       cover administrative processing. The FME will inform the HARM office via AF Form
       1042 if the applicable waiver authority extends an aircrew member‗s medical
       certification. The official date of the AF Form 1042 will be the date of the flight
       surgeon‗s signature. See also AFI 11-402.
   2.17.4. Validate entitlement to flying/jump incentive pays with member‗s finance office. The
   HARM office will ensure receipt of documentation required to validate accurate flight/jump
   pay entitlement, to include verification that the member is receiving the correct rate of
   incentive pay.
   2.17.5. Validate personnel data changes with member‗s unit orderly room. Contact the MPF
   to obtain a UMD and a personnel listing to reflect member‗s current assignment data. As a
   minimum, validate DAFSC, API, effective date of duty, unit manning position numbers, and
   active Guard/Reserve duty (AGR) or non-EAD status for ARC personnel.
   2.17.6. Monitor and ensure the proper FAC and ASC are assigned for all assigned and
   attached fliers.
   2.17.7. Ensure Special Category Codes are updated in ARMS according to Table 2.13 when

Facilities or Aircraft

2.20. Attachment for Flying/Parachuting.
   2.20.1. Aircrew/parachutist       members assigned by PCS/PCA orders to active
   flying/parachutist positions in US Air Force units and organizations without flying facilities
   or aircraft may be attached for flying/parachuting to units with appropriate resources. Intra -
   wing attachments may be approved by the OG/CC. Individuals must request (in writing)
   attachment for flying/jumping through their chain of command to their MAJCOM or
   equivalent. (EXCEPTION: Request for attachment for flying/parachuting is not required if
   flying/parachuting support and a primary unit/aircraft is addressed in a host -tenant
   agreement. Members will provide required information to the servicing HARM office.)
   Approval authority may be delegated as directed by MAJCOMs. The request must include:
   Individual‗s name, rank, Social Security Number (SSN), aviation service date (ASD),
   aviation service code (ASC), aeronautical rating (or badge), expected duration of attachment,
   date of separation (DOS)/expiration of term of service (ETS), assigned duty position
   title/position number/API code, aircraft last qualified in, date last flown, current AO, current
   AF Form 1042, and requested unit of attachment and point of contact. (Parachutists need
   only provide information applicable to parachuting.) Individuals should coordinate
   flying/parachute qualification, currency and attachment with requested units prior to
   submitting formal request. MAJCOMs will develop procedures for attachments within the
   MAJCOM. For attachments outside an individual‗s MAJCOM, submit the request to both
   MAJCOMs (or equivalent) for coordination. For attachments outside the USAF, submit the
80                                  AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


  request to the gaining unit‗s MAJCOM equivalent approval authority and the individual‗ s
  parent MAJCOM (or equivalent) approval authority for coordination.
  2.20.1. (PACAF) All flyers in PACAF assigned to an active flying/parachutist position
  without flying facilities or aircraft will be attached to a flying/jumping unit that will track
  their flying/jump requirement. HQ PACAF/A3/5/8 has delegated final approval authority for
  all attachments for flying/jumping within PACAF to PACAF/A3T and it is the A3T‘s
  responsibility to equitably distribute all attached flyers/jumpers throughout the command.
  Attachment for flying/jumping requests must be accomplished in writing by the individual
  requesting attachment. It is the responsibility of the requesting individual to pre-coordinate
  with the prospective unit of attachment. Submit formal requests through the individual‘s
  commander, to the requested unit training office, for endorsement by the requested unit
  commander. Obtain the concurrence of the OG prior to submission to HQ PACAF.
  Requests can be submitted electronically to expedite the approval process. Scan and attach
  three documents (current Aeronautical Order (AO), AF Form 1042, UMPR, Individual Data
  Summary and Individual Training Summary). Forward requested unit recommendations for
  approval, or rational for disapproval, to HQ PACAF/A3T. No flights/jumps will take place
  until approved request has been approved. HQ PACAF/A3T will send an information copy
  of the approved request to the individual, the attached unit, and assigned HARM who will
  maintain the approved request in the member FRF throughout the individual‘s tenure of
  attachment. With the exception of COMPACAF, Flight record folders will be maintained at
  the servicing HARM for the attached unit. The HARM who owns the FRF will notify HQ
  PACAF/A3T and the unit of attachment when the individual is no longer attached for
  flying/jumping.
     2.20.1.1. (Added-PACAF) Cross-command attachments must be coordinated by the
     requesting member‘s MAJCOM prior to arriving at HQ PACAF/A3TC. Additionally,
     PACAF/A3T must coordinate on PACAF flyers seeking attachment to another
     MAJCOM‘s flying unit prior to the request being sent to that MAJCOM. PACAF/A3T is
     the final approval authority for flyers and jumpers from other MAJCOM‘s attaching to a
     PACAF unit. EXCEPTION: Flight surgeons of other commands, in valid API 5
     positions, may be attached to PACAF units without memorandums of attachment
     provided such support is addressed in a memorandum of agreement between the flight
     surgeon‘s base/command and the PACAF unit owning the aircraft. All such
     memorandums of attachment will be forwarded to HQ PACAF/A3TC and kept on file.
     Memorandums of attachment are reaccomplished every 36 months or upon reassignment
     (PCS/PCA) (this includes when the unit of attachment deactivates), whichever is earliest.
     2.20.1.2. (Added-PACAF) API 6/B Individuals assigned to units falling within or under
     the same OG (i.e., the OSS), do not require formal attachment for flying when flying with
     other units within the group.
  2.20.2. Attachment units will provide resources necessary for the member to complete and
  maintain minimum training requirements established in applicable aircrew/parachutist
  training publications, including TDY cost to formal training courses. The unit to which the
  member is assigned is responsible for cost of the member‗s TDY travel to the attached unit to
  accomplish normal training requirements. The attached unit will maintain the FEF.

      2.22.1.2. (DELETED)
      2.22.1.3. (DELETED)
   2.22.2. Inter-Fly. AFRC operations group commanders are authorized to approve flights
   with AFRC units for aircrew members not assigned or attached to an AFRC unit and are the
   final authority for determining when an active duty/air national guard member may fly unit
   aircraft. Such aircrew members must provide operations group commanders with a source
   for validating aircrew qualifications, training and currencies prior to flying. AFRC OG/CCs
   will forward information copies of interfly agreements to the respective NAF/A3.
   EXCEPTION: Those units with an existing written agreement, e.g. TFI/associate units, will
   follow guidance within the agreement.
      2.22.2.1. (Added) Interfly agreements may involve the exchange and/or substitution of
      aircrew members and/or aircraft between different MAJCOM units to accomplish flying
      in support of contingencies, exercises or designated missions according to the appropriate
      OPLAN/CONOPS.
      2.22.2.2. (Added) During situations where interfly may be an option, aircraft ownership
      does not change. Aircraft hours executed will be credited to the command and unit of
      assignment of the aircraft regardless of the crews MAJCOM affiliation. Ensure use of
      correct mission symbol.
          2.22.2.2.1. (Added) For TFI units, there are two separate and distinctly funded
          flying hour programs. Unit ‗owning aircraft‘ has responsibility for oversight and
          management of both programs in tandem. TFI and Associate units are t o use their
          respective command‗s mission symbols regardless of crew status
          (Active/ANG/Reserve).

2.23. Flying With ANG Units.
   2.23.1. The ANG Wing Commander must concur on all active duty flying with ANG units.
   Flying is restricted to Air Force advisors and aircrews who support unit training objectives,
   contingencies, or operational missions to include aircrew that inspect, standardize, augment,
   or assist in unit conversion. (Individuals will not be listed on the ANG web page since they
   are not formally attached to an ANG unit for the purpose of obtaining continuation training.)
   With the deployed commander‗s concurrence, active duty aircr ew attached to Air Warrior,
   Combat Archer and Combat Hammer are authorized to fly with ANG units.
   2.23.2. Active duty flying with ANG units for the sole purpose of continuation training (CT)
   is prohibited without approval from the ANG Director of Operations (NGB/A3). (Future
   Total Force [FTF] wings will coordinate active duty CT flying IAW the MAJCOM
   CONOPS). Forward all requests for active duty CT flying support to NGB/A3 with
   appropriate ANG Wing Commander and MAJCOM/A3 concurrence. Requests must include:
   name, rank, office symbol (e.g., 9 AF/DOV), primary aircraft MDS (e.g., F -16C, C-130E),
   aircrew position (e.g., IP, IN), and reason for requested CT support. A complete list of AD
   aircrew approved to fly CT sorties with the ANG is available on the NGB/A3O Portal.
   2.23.3. Active duty aircrew members authorized to fly ANG aircraft in accordance with
   Paragraph 2.22.2 may coordinate sortie support directly with the unit. Members must
   provide the supporting unit operations group commander with a source for verifying
   currencies, egress training, flight qualification, etc., before flying. The supporting unit
   operations group commander is the final authority for determining when active duty aircrew
   may fly unit aircraft.
   2.23.4. Conduct flying in accordance with applicable US Air Force, lead MAJCOM, and
   ANG instructions.
2.24. Coordination Authorization. Direct communication with MAJCOMs, AFRC, and ANG
concerning attachment of rated personnel is authorized.

                               FLIGHT DOCUMENTATION

Section 3A—Records Maintenance

3.1. Flight and Jump Records and Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS)
Functional Responsibility. The individual flight or jump record folder is the official source for
determining incentive pay entitlement, current flying or jump status, and total experience.
HARM offices will enter aviation resource data into the ARMS database and maintain
FRFs/JRFs IAW Paragraph 2.17.2 of this instruction. Dispose of Air Force records in
accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS), located at
https://afrims.amc.af.mil, and this instruction.
   3.1.1. Use these records as the basis for USAF flying resource inventory reporting (RCS:
   HAF-A3O[M&AR]0701). This report provides essential individual flying information to HQ
   USAF and MAJCOMs. HARM offices ensure the report is transmitted not later than the 10th
   of each month (or as soon as possible for special reports). Continue to report during
   emergency conditions, precedence delayed (Emergency Status Code C -3).
   Continue reporting during MINIMIZE.
   3.1.2. The HARM office is the sole approval authority (except for HQ USAF/A3OT) at each
   flying base for entitlement to and the initiation and termination of Aviation Career Incentive
   Pay (ACIP), Career Enlisted Flyer Incentive Pay (CEFIP), and Hazardous Duty Ince ntive
   Pay (HDIP) for flying and parachute duties. The HARM office interprets public law as it
   pertains to flying/jumping incentive pays; audits, reconciles, and processes associated waiver
   requests; is the single point of contact for ARMS; and is responsible for the following
   procedures:
       3.1.2.1. The HARM office, maintains FRFs/JRFs for all flying (active and inactive) and
       jump personnel with the assigned HARM code established for that base. The ARMS
       program manager will allocate one ARMS database code per base. (EXCEPTION: The
       ARMS program manager may allocate more than one ARMS database code for
       installations granted an exception IAW Paragraph 2.17 of this instruction.) The HARM
       office must be located in a securable area to ensure integrity of Privacy Act material
       when office personnel are not present.
           3.1.2.1.1. Base HARM offices keep the FRFs/JRFs for all assigned tenant and
           attached personnel ordered to take part in regular and frequent flights as aircrew,
           operational support members, and parachutists. This includes all active duty and ARC
           active and inactive aircrew members, active operational support members, and
           parachutists. (EXCEPTION: HARM offices will not create/maintain FRFs or JRFs
           for UNRAPPs.)
           3.1.2.1.2. Base HARM offices will combine the FRF and JRF into one folder for dual
           qualified aircrew and parachutist members. File documents IAW AFI 11 -421.
           3.1.2.1.3. Base HARM offices will maintain FRFs/JRFs for disqualified aircrew or
           parachutists (entitlement status 0) for eight years after such designation. After eight
           consecutive years, return the FRF/JRF to the member. (EXCEPTION: for UFT

         students disqualified from training and operational support fliers removed from flying
         for more than one year, release the FRF to the member and comply with out -
         processing guidance in AFI 11-421.)
  3.1.3. Initiate a Military Pay Order (MPO) (except for non-USAF members) NLT 5 work
  days when:
     3.1.3.1. An aircrew/parachutist member initially meets or fails to meet flight/jump
     entitlement requirements for pay.
     3.1.3.2. An    aircrew/parachutist    member      satisfies  flight/jump  entitlement
     requirements for pay following a period of failure to meet minimum requirements (or a
     period of suspension disqualification has been removed), or a member
     otherwise regains entitlement to incentive pay.
     3.1.3.3. An individual in conditional entitlement status (ESC 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, E, F, G, or H)
     departs PCS to a non-flying or non-jump position.
     3.1.3.4. A parachutist enters into a 12-month Rule 3 waiver period IAW DODFMR and
     AFI 11-421, Aviation Resource Management. The HARM office will terminate pay until
     jump requirements are met.
  3.1.4. Release the FRF to individual custody only after the HARM office receives:
     3.1.4.1. Official PCS orders or TDY orders indicating a TDY with another USAF
     activity for a period of 90 days or more (ref. Paragraph 1.5.4). (Units have the option to
     transfer records to the gaining HARM office for TDYs.).
         3.1.4.1.1. (Added-PACAF) While attending a formal school over 30 days where
         flying is authorized, or otherwise on a flying TDY of 30 days or more, individuals
         will document all flying hours and continuation training on the appropriate extract
         documents (AF Form 3520, TAR/MAR). Within 3 duty days after returning to their
         duty station, individuals will provide this documentation to their unit flight manager
         who will in-turn update the ARMS database.
     3.1.4.2. Official retirement or separation orders.
     3.1.4.3. Notice that the aircrew member has been disqualified for more than eight
     consecutive years. (See Paragraph 3.1.2.1.3 for one-year release.)
     3.1.4.4. (Added-PACAF) Do not release FRFs to any other individual without the
     approval of the Host Aviation Resource Management Chief. All records authorized to be
     signed in/out will have such action documented and tracked on an AF Form 614, Charge-
     Out Record. The individual signing for the record is responsible for returning it in the
     same condition as received. Do not release the FRF to individuals in suspended (ASC
     04) aviation service status or individuals otherwise known to be under investigation.
  3.1.5. Release of Data from Flight/Jump Records.
     3.1.5.1. Information maintained in the FRF/JRF is subject to the provisions of the
     Privacy Act of 1974. HARM offices have a legal obligation to safeguard these records
     from unlawful disclosure. Standard ARMS reports or ad hoc queries which contain
     personal data will have the symbol "(PA)" in the product title and contain the statement
     "Personal Data - Privacy Act of 1974."
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                      85


      3.1.5.2. The disclosure of information, for any purpose, to other than those AF activities
      with an official need, is not authorized without the expressed written consent of the
      member concerned.
      3.1.5.3. Except where allowed by law, do not disclose data to agencies outside the
      Department of Defense. Reference AFI 33-332, Privacy Act Program. Maintain a record
      of each disclosure to include name and address of the person or agency receiving the
      data, date, nature and purpose of each disclosure.
          3.1.5.3.1. Retain a copy of the disclosure on file as part of the FRF/JRF. Prior to
          releasing the FRF/JRF, the HARM office will remove all records disclosures. Retain
          the disclosure accounting on file for five years or for the life of the record, whichever
          is longer.
      3.1.5.4. The Pilot Records Improvement Act of 1996 requires that before a civilian
      airline hires a pilot, the air carrier must request and receive certain records from "any
      carrier or other persons that have employed the individual at any time during the
      preceding five years." Before any information is released to an agency based on this Act,
      HARM offices must receive a written release of information statement signed by the
      applicant via the agency or applicant. This statement confirms the applicant agrees to the
      release of records to the air carrier. The HARM office will not release any information
      without receipt of this signed statement. HARM offices must release information within
      30 days of receipt of the request. Additionally, the releaser must provide notice to the
      applicant that a release request has been received and inform the applicant of his or her
      right to receive a copy of the records. The HARM office will provide the Individual
      Flight Record (IFR), Flying History Report (FHR), and documents contained in the
      member‗s Flying Evaluation Folder (FEF) for the preceding five years from the date of
      employment application of the member. If the member‗s FEF is maintained in another
      location, the HARM office must obtain and provide copies to the requesting agency.
   3.1.6. The FRFs/JRFs of personnel assigned or attached to other than USAF activities must
   be kept at a designated HARM office. The following guidance applies:
      3.1.6.1. The parent command will designate a HARM office to maintain FRFs/JRFs for
      individual aircrew members or parachutists on duty with other US military services.
      3.1.6.2. The MAJCOM with geographical cognizance over the area or country to which
      the individual is assigned or attached for duty with an allied service or on duty with non -
      US military agencies will designate a HARM office to maintain the FRF/JRF.
      3.1.6.3. If the individual‗s FRF/JRF is required at the crewmember‗s or parachutist‗s
      duty station, provide a duplicate copy. The master record will be kept at the HARM
      office designated by the MAJCOM.
      3.1.6.4. The designated HARM office will notify the member‗s parent MAJCOM if the
      member will exceed 180 days in FSC ―S‖ or FSC ―4‖ status. Notify the MAJCOM prior
      to the member exceeding the 180-day limit. See also Paragraph 1.4.1.8.

3.2. Background Information. This section explains the conditions under which personnel are
authorized to log flight activity into ARMS. ARMS will be used for tracking and management of
all aircrew and operational support flight activity. NOTE: 306 OSS/OSOF (USAFA HARM)
will assign military DoD/UNRAPP training requirements in the ARMS training database to those
who obtain a qualification through completion of 306 FTG airmanship programs.
   3.2.1. The Air Force flying program is designed to ensure that each individual actively
   engaged in performing airborne duties maintains basic professional skills. This
   requires accurately logged flight and simulator activity to record and monitor flying
   experience.
   3.2.2. Flight data must be recorded and reported accurately to provide commanders with
   meaningful flight experience information to ensure resources are effectively used and only
   qualified personnel receive incentive pay. Units will follow AFI 33 -360,Publications and
   Forms Management, to develop local training accomplishment forms for entering training
   data into ARMS.
       3.2.2.1. (Added-PACAF) Locally developed training accomplishment documents will
       be submitted to PACAF/A3T for approval prior to utilization. Additionally, a waiver is
       required if the unit plans on going to paperless TARS by utilizing PEX or other types
       systems to track continuation training.
   3.2.3. Responsibility of Pilot in Command. Enter and credit flight time on an individual‗s
   flight record only when flown according to this instruction and properl y logged on AFTO
   Form 781 or AF Form 3250. The pilot designated, as "in command" of the aircraft is
   responsible for making sure the appropriate form is dated and properly completed, to include
   specific remarks as required. These forms provide an accurate record of pertinent flight data
   for personnel authorized to take part in the flight and to receive ACIP, CEFIP, or HDIP.
3.3. Crediting Flight Time. Credit flying time as follows:
   3.3.1. To credit flight activity, personnel must:
       3.3.1.1. Be physically qualified. The member cannot be in DNIF status and must be
       medically cleared for flying duty, documented on an AF Form 1042.
       3.3.1.2. Be physiologically qualified (if applicable for the aircraft).
       3.3.1.3. Be on AOs to take part in frequent and regular flights as aircrew, to obtain
       aircrew qualification, or as operational support members (IAW AFI 11-402).
       3.3.1.4. Be under an approved aircrew qualification code (based on AF Form 8/8a
       qualification) and aircrew position identifier (Table A2.3) designated on the flight
       authorization for the aircraft. (EXCEPTION: aircrew members authorized to perform
       inflight duties in non-USAF aircraft, IAW Paragraph 1.11, will comply with guidance
       applicable to the authority controlling the aircraft in regards to flight authorization
       requirements.)
       3.3.1.5. Be part of the crew complement (AFI 65 -503) authorized to perform aircrew
       duties in the aircraft in order to obtain and maintain aircrew qualification, or be required
       for the mission.
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                    87


          3.3.1.5.1. Individuals required for the mission who are not par t of the crew
          complement may log flying time only when specifically authorized to perform duties
          required for the mission (e.g. AEs, CROs, PJs, combat camera, etc), or when
          specifically authorized to perform mission-related observation or evaluation duties.
          Members will comply with all other applicable requirements to include medical
          clearance and physiological training (if applicable).
          3.3.1.5.1. (PACAF) Individuals required for a mission to perform mission-related
          observation duties or evaluation duties but are not part of the crew complement must
          be approved by the squadron commander of the flying unit prior to flight. Document
          approval on a mission requirements letter (Atch 13) and provide to HARM to be filed
          permanently in the FRF.
              3.3.1.5.1.1. (Added) Commanders will include an explanatory note in the
              remarks section of the FA for crewmembers that exceed the crew complement
              but are required for the mission.
          3.3.1.5.2. Non-aircrew members assigned to flying unit commander positions may
          log flying time in assigned aircraft. Individuals will fly on a non -interference basis
          (reference Paragraph 2.12.4), will use crew position "OX" (Colonel and above) or
          "XX" (Lt Col and below) IAW Table A2.3, and will log other time on the AFTO
          Form 781 for entry into ARMS.
          3.3.1.5.3. Non-aircrew members assigned to UAS sensor operator positions will log
          flying time in assigned UAS aircraft. Individuals will fly on a non -interference basis
          (reference Paragraph 2.12.7), will use aircrew position (Second Character) "X"
          IAW Table A2.3, and will log AFTO Form 781 flying time category commensurate
          with qualification and duties performed for entry into ARMS.
   3.3.2. Flights in any other capacity are orientation flights IAW Paragraph 1.9.4.7.1 and
   logging flight time on an AFTO Form 781 is not authorized. Commanders will ensure
   crewmembers and parachutists do not credit flights/jumps while on leave, permissive TDY,
   or nonflying/nonjumping TDY/Temporary Assignment Duty (TAD), regardless of duration,
   or while flying on an aircraft during point-to-point travel (not authorized or required to
   perform aircrew duties). Aircrew members will not log flying time when the purpose for
   flying is to make a proficiency sustaining jump or perform jumpmaster duties.
   EXCEPTION: Pararescue personnel in "X" coded billets may log flying time if aircrew
   duties are performed during the flying portion of the mission. Document duties performed in
   the remarks section of the AFTO Form 781.
   3.3.3. For individuals authorized to perform inflight duties in non-US Air Force aircraft,
   reference Paragraph 1.11, Paragraph 3.3.1.4, above, does not apply. IAW Paragraph
   3.3.1.5, individuals must be required for the mission.
3.4. Definition of Flight Time Categories. The references in this paragraph to aircraft also
apply to synthetic training devices categorized as operational flying trainers or weapon system
trainers. Log flight time only on the AFTO Form 781 and AF Form 3520,

  3.4.1. Primary Flight Time. Time logged by a member occupying a designated du ty
  station identified in AFI 65-503, and actively performing the duty associated with their
  aircrew specialty. Only qualified aircrew members and aircrew members obtaining
  qualification in the aircraft will log primary time when performing in -flight duties. Non-
  rated aircrew members and operational support personnel who do not have an established
  crew duty station will log primary time only when actually performing required in -flight
  duty. For example: operating equipment or caring for medical evacuation patients.
     3.4.1.1. EXCEPTIONS:
         3.4.1.1.1. Pilot commanders and key supervisors who fly IAW the provisions of
         Paragraph 3.7.1 will log primary time only when actually controlling the aircraft.
         3.4.1.1.2. Pilots who maintain qualification in single-place aircraft when completing
         instrument training or the instrument flight check in similar dual -place aircraft.
         3.4.1.1.3. Graduates of a military test pilot school (Air Force Test Pilot School, Navy
         Test Pilot School, etc.) are considered qualified and may log primary flight time using
         FP, FN, or FW as the flight authorization duty code while actively flying qualitative
         or approved short-term aircraft tests or evaluations. This does not authorize Test Pilot
         School graduates to perform duties on other missions requiring qualified aircrew
         members at the controls of the aircraft (e.g. functional check flights).
         3.4.1.1.4. Pararescue/Combat Rescue Officer aircrew members assigned to
         authorized flying billets, on active flying AOs and qualified in the MDS, who are
         required in addition to the normal aircrew complement to perform in -flight duties for
         mass rescued aircrew member/personnel missions may log primary flight time when
         performing patient support duties on mass personnel recovery missions. Primary time
         is authorized only during the time required in-flight duties are performed. During
         periods when the PJ is not performing in-flight duties associated with the rescued
         members, or if the PJ is non-current for that MDS, "Other" flight time will be logged.
         Annotate specific inflight duties that require additional crewmembers (in additional to
         basic crew complement) on the mission in the remarks section of the AFTO Form
         781.
         3.4.1.1.5. (Added) Operational support medical personnel may log primary time
         when tasked to perform primary medical support duties on real world Combat Search
         and Rescue (CSAR), Casualty Eva cuation (CASEVAC) or Medical Evacuation
         (MEDEVAC) missions. If tasked to fly on sister service CSAR, CASEVAC, or
         MEDEVAC missions, ensure requests are coordinated though the member‗s
         MAJCOM IAW Paragraph 1.11.1 of this instruction.
         3.4.1.1.6. (Added) Aeromedical        Evacuation      Crewmembers        (AECM)      on
         Aeromedical Readiness Missions (ARM) are authorized to conduct simultaneous
         (tandem) training on the same aircraft utilizing no more than two basic AE crews to
         meet flight currency requirements. AECMs in primary crew positions will log
         primary time when performing in-flight duties. Example: Two basic AE crews
         conducting separate in-flight training using separate in-flight kits, medical equipment,
         and mission documentation. A lead crew will be identified to the flight crew prior to
         take off for CRM purposes.
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                    89


     3.4.1.2. For pilots, primary time is time actively controlling the aircraft, excluding
     hands-on-time flown while instructing and evaluating (log such time under instructor or
     evaluator). It is not predicated on which set of controls is being used (multi -place
     aircraft), or on the duty position indicated on the flight authorization. Pilots receiving
     instruction while controlling the aircraft will log primary time
     3.4.1.3. Astronauts performing duties in the space shuttle may log primary time in their
     rated specialty in accordance with the preceding paragraphs. Astronauts performing space
     station duties may log primary time for the duration of space station activity. For space
     station duty, use Aircrew Position Identifier (Second Character) "A" from Attachment 2,
     Table A2.3.
     3.4.1.4. For other aircrew specialties, log primary flight time only when
     performing duties at a duty position established for that specialty. Where more than one
     station is established for the same specialty, one member at each such station may log
     primary time while actually performing the duties associated with that station (for
     example, multiple Air Surveillance Operator positions on a single aircraft). (MAJCOMs
     will specify which AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning Factors, authorized
     crew duty station(s) flight test engineers may occupy during test functions. During
     periods when the flight test engineer is not actively performing his or her evaluation/test
     duties, Other time will be logged.) Except under conditions in this paragraph, the total
     primary time for any specific aircrew specialty will not exceed the total flight time.
         3.4.1.5. Nonrated aircrew members on active flying AOs, qualified in specific
         aircraft, but tasked to perform in-flight aircrew duties for a time-sensitive mission in
         an aircraft in which they are not current and/or not qualified, will log aircrew
         certification code (first character of crew position) "F" and primary time for that
         mission. See also paragraph 3.3.1.5.1.
  3.4.2. Secondary Flight Time. Flight time logged by a crewmember who is performing
  inflight duties related to the crewmember‗s specialty, but who is not controlling the function
  of that specialty. Except as listed below, the total secondary time logged in each specialty
  will not exceed the total flight time. When crewmembers are in excess of the authorized crew
  complement, annotate in the remarks of the AFTO Form 781 the secondary duties performed
  by additional aircrew.
     3.4.2.1. The member must be maintaining or obtaining qualification in the aircraft to log
     secondary time. EXCEPTION: Crewmembers in aircrew positions designated in AFI 65
     -503; and tasked to perform primary duties on aircraft other than their assigned aircraft
     (e.g., Flight Attendants tasked by TACC or HHQ to support Silver Bullet or DV
     missions) will log secondary time a s long as they maintain currency in their primary
     aircraft. The member‗s aircrew certification code will reflect the current qualification. If
     not qualified in the aircraft, the member will log ―X‖ or ―O‖ as the aircrew qualification
     code first character IAW Table A2.3.
     3.4.2.2. For pilots, log secondary time while occupying a duty position having a set of
     flight controls and not actively controlling the aircraft, instructing, or evaluating.
     3.4.2.3. For other aircrew specialties, log secondary time when actually performing
     inflight duties of the specialty, but not at the primary duty station established for that
90                                   AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


     specialty (for example, second navigator during airdrop missions or additional PJs/CROs
     on AOs required to perform "in-flight duties" assisting mass aircrew/personnel on a
     rescue mission) when dictated by mission requirements.
         3.4.2.3.1. Annotate in the remarks section of the AFTO Form 781 specific inflight
         duties performed and circumstances that require additional crewmembers (in
         additional to basic crew complement) to perform the mission.
     3.4.2.4. A current Aeromedical Evacuation Crewmember (AECM) may log secondary
     time when performing simulated patient duties or Mission Clinical Coordinator duties
     during aeromedical readiness missions. A noncurrent AECM may only log Other flight
     time when performing simulated patient duties
     3.4.2.5. Except as provided for in AFI 65-503, the total secondary time logged in each
     specialty will not exceed the total flight time.
     3.4.2.6. Pararescue aircrew members assigned to authorized flying billets, on active
     flying AOs and qualified in the MDS, who are required in addition to the normal aircrew
     complement to perform in-flight duties for mass rescued aircrew member/personnel
     missions, may log secondary time when performing simulated patient duties or Mission
     Coordinator duties on mass personnel recovery training missions. Secondary time is
     authorized only during such time those in-flight duties are performed. During periods
     when the PJ is not performing "in-flight" duties associated with the rescued members or
     mission coordinator, or non-current for that MDS, only Other flight time will be logged.
  3.4.3. Instructor Flight Time. Flight time logged by a designated and qualified instructor
  while actively performing authorized instructional duti es. Includes "hands on" time during
  demonstration activities that are part of instructional duties. The instructor is not required to
  occupying a primary duty station established for that specialty, but must be actually
  performing instructor duties. Except as provided for in this section, members must be
  qualified and current in the aircraft to log instructor time. Except as provided for in AFI 65 -
  503 and Paragraph 3.4.3.1, the total instructor flight time for each aircrew specialty will not
  exceed the total flight time.
     3.4.3.1. Instructors may log instructor time while accomplishing unlike specialty training
     instruction (e.g., an instructor navigator training pilots/boom operators for the three -
     person crew or third pilots in the navigator seat). Only the amount of time used to tr ain a
     specific event may be logged as instructor time. If more than one instructor of like
     specialty are on the aircraft to provide simultaneous instruction for crewmembers of
     different specialties, both instructors may log instructor time (e.g., two instr uctor
     navigators are on the same aircraft, one is instructing a student navigator and the other is
     instructing a boom operator). In this case, total instructor time logged may exceed total
     flight time logged. Enter a remark on the back of the AFTO Form 781 explaining the
     rationale for logging excess instructor time.
     3.4.3.2. Two instructors (to include FTU) of the same specialty may fly together and
     each log instructor time; however, total instructor time logged may not exceed total flight
     time logged. (e.g., A new FTU instructor is flying with a student crew and a more
     experienced FTU instructor flies with the new FTU instructor; instruction can occur
     between the new FTU instructor and student or between the experienced FTU instructor
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                      91


     and new instructor, but not both simultaneously. Therefore, the total instructor time
     logged may not exceed total flight time.)
     3.4.3.3. Aircrew members who are instructor qualified in one aircraft, and who are
     current and qualified (but not qualified as an instructor) in another aircraft, may log
     instructor time while flying in the second aircraft and providing instruction to an aircrew
     member in the first aircraft. This applies to instructors in single seat aircraft who are also
     qualified in chase aircraft, but who do not maintain instructor qualification in the chase
     aircraft. Instructor time may be logged only while actively providing instruction. Enter a
     remark on the back of the AFTO Form 781 to explain the rationale for logging instructor
     time in the chase aircraft (this paragraph may be cited as a reference).
     3.4.3.4. Instructors will log primary, secondary, or other time, depending on their
     activity, when not performing instructor duties.
     3.4.3.5. Log simulator console time as instructor time when the crewmember is qualified
     as an instructor in the aircraft. When MAJCOMs authorize crewmembers to be
     instructors in the simulator only, they may log simulator console time as instructor time.
     MAJCOMs will determine which types of simulators qualify for this approval, e.g.,
     operational flight trainers, weapon system trainers, etc.
  3.4.4. Evaluator Flight Time. Flight time flown by a designated and certified flight
  evaluator while actively performing authorized flight evaluation duties. Includes ―hands on‖
  time if coincident with performance of flight evaluator duties. The member is not required to
  occupy a primary duty station established for that specialty, but must be actually performing
  evaluator duties. Evaluators will also log instructor, primary, secondary, or other time,
  depending on their activity, when not performing evaluator duties.
     3.4.4.1. (Added) Aircrew members who are designated and certified as a flight
     evaluator in one aircraft, and who are current and qualified (but not certified as a flight
     evaluator) in another aircraft, may log evaluator time while flying in the second aircraft
     and evaluating an aircrew member in the first aircraft. This applies to flight evaluators in
     single seat aircraft who are also qualified in chase aircraft, but who are not certified as a
     flight evaluator in the chase aircraft. Enter a remark on the back of the AFTO Form 781
     to explain the rationale for logging evaluator time in the chase paragraph (this paragraph
     may be cited as a reference).
  3.4.5. Other Flight Time. Flight time flown by members who are on the
  flight authorization, but who are not occupying a designated duty station or conforming to
  the requirements of primary, secondary, instructor, or evaluator time. For example: additional
  or extra crewmembers taking part in the flight, required for the mission to augment the crew
  or perform mission-related observation or evaluator duties (not qualified in the
  aircraft). Indoctrination fliers log other time. Crewmembers will log other time during
  periods of crew rest or sleep.
  3.4.6. Combat and Combat Support Flight Time.
     3.4.6.1. Combat. Aerial activity, engagements, or attacks conducted by aircraft against
     an enemy of the US or an opposing foreign force when there is risk of exposure to hostile
     fire. Aerial activity in support of forces engaged in combat when there i s risk of
     exposure to hostile fire. Combat includes both elements: activity against an enemy or
 92                                  AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


       opposing force (or activity supporting forces engaging an enemy or opposing force) and
       risk of exposure to hostile fire.
          3.4.6.1.1. As soon as possible after a combat zone is established, the Commander Air
          Force Forces (COMAFFOR) will identify which portion constitutes hostile airspace.
          Hostile airspace is airspace within a combat zone that has been specifically
          designated as hostile airspace by the COMAFFOR, based on risk of exposure to
          hostile fire. The combat zone may contain areas that are not designated as hostile
          airspace. For the purposes of logging combat time the aerial activity must be
          accomplished in a designated combat zone within the desi gnated hostile airspace.
          Flight within the combat zone but outside of the designated area or areas of hostile
          airspace does not qualify as combat time, since there is no risk of exposure to hostile
          fire. (EXCEPTION: In cases of aircrews that employ standoff weapons, the
          COMAFFOR under extraordinary circumstances may permit those aircrews to log
          combat time outside of the hostile airspace and/or outside of the designated combat
          zone. If an exception is granted, include the exception in the guidance designa ting
          the combat zone and the hostile airspace.) COMAFFOR will publish
          guidelines specifying which aircraft missions may log combat/combat support flight
          time and will identify the inclusive dates that the hostile airspace is activated for
          logging combat time. During contingencies when a combat zone is not designated but
          the use of force is authorized, COMAFFOR will coordinate with AF/A3/5 to establish
          hostile airspace criteria and guidelines for logging combat/combat support flight
          time. NOTE: COMAFFOR will issue new guidance and procedures every two years
          to ensure all Air Force units are aware of the current policy.
       3.4.6.2. Combat Support. Aerial activity, engagements, or attacks conducted by aircraft
       against an enemy of the US or an opposing foreign force that operate outside the
       designated hostile airspace, where there is no risk of exposure to hostile fire. Includes
       aerial activity directly supporting forces engaged in combat or directly supporting those
       who are actively supporting combat when the aerial activity occurs outside the designated
       hostile airspace. Hostile airspace is determined as described above under combat time.
       3.4.6.3. Combat or combat support time will be logged from takeoff to landing when an
       individual: (1) meets the requirements of combat/combat support flight time, (2) is on an
       AO that requires the member to fly, (3) is listed on the flight authorization authorized to
       perform in-flight aircrew duties and, (4) is required for the mission IAW paragraph 3.3
       of this instruction. Additionally,eligible members authorized to fly IAW paragraph 3.7.1
       may log combat or combat support time. Do not combine mission symbols; use one
       symbol for the entire flight.
   3.4.7. Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Time. UAS crews may be authorized to
   simultaneously control more than one aircraft during flight operations. The total time logged
   by each individual will reflect the total time spent controlling aircraft inflight and is not
   dependent upon the number of aircraft actually controlled. Flight time logged will not exceed
   the time the individual was performing inflight duties.
3.5. Flight Condition Time. The categories listed in Paragraph 3.4 are the basis for
accumulating flying experience for all flying personnel. Record all flying time accrued on a
mission in the appropriate category. Provisions have been made to record, for historical
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                    93


purposes, a breakout of flight time by flight condition: night, instrument, and simulat ed
instrument. Primary time flown in more than one condition simultaneously (for example, night
and instrument) would result in entries under both of these categories on the form. The type of
time logged will be consistent with the flight condition actually encountered or procedure
accomplished. MAJCOMs may further restrict logging combinations that are inconsistent with
command policy or procedures. Use the following guidance for logging flight condition time:
   3.5.1. Night Time. That portion of primary, secondary, instructor, or evaluator flight time
   logged between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil twilight,
   as published in the American Air Almanac. (EXCEPTION: An evaluator will log night time
   as a flight condition in conjunction with "other" flight time when performing evaluation
   duties onboard aircraft in which he or she does not maintain qualification.) Crewmembers
   having night training requirements (includes wear of NVG) specified by Air Force or
   MAJCOM publications will log this time. For personnel assigned at latitudes above 60
   degrees north (May through August) or below 60 degrees south (November through
   February), night requirements are waived when removal from active flying or PCS occu rs
   during the summer months. May be logged in a flight simulator when operating in simulated
   night conditions.
   3.5.2. Primary Instrument Time. The portion of primary, instructor, or evaluator flight
   time logged when external conditions require that the aircraft attitude be maintained
   primarily by reference to the flight instruments. Pilots only will log this time when
   performing duties in this flight condition.
   3.5.3. Primary Simulated Instrument Time. The portion of primary, "hands-on"
   instructor, or "hands-on" evaluator time logged by an individual controlling the aircraft
   attitude primarily by reference to the flight instruments. Pilots only will log this time when
   performing duties in this flight condition. May be logged in a flight simulator.
   3.5.4. Night Vision Goggle Time. The portion of flight time logged by an aircrew member
   wearing night vision goggles between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of
   morning civil twilight, as published in the American Air Almanac. Crewmembers performing
   aircrew duties in a crew position with NVG training requirements will log this time while
   wearing NVGs. NVG time may also be logged by flight surgeons and aircrew members
   instructing or evaluating individuals who are performing crew duties where NVGs are
   required and worn. NVG time will not exceed total night time logged. NVG time may be
   logged in a flight simulator if the simulator is accredited for NVG training (simulator model
   and simulator software).
3.6. Non-rated Flight Time. Non-rated aircrew members will log flying time using the proper
flight authorization duty code. Log time only when authorized on AOs and when
actively performing specific inflight duties as designated by flight authorization orders
(Paragraph 3.9). Aeromedical evacuation crewmembers log time only when listed on the flight
authorization and actively engaged in operational air evacuation or air rescue missions;
aeromedical research and development inflight; or air evacuation tra ining missions that require
AECMs in a crew position, being instructed, being evaluated, or as listed in Paragraph 3.4.2.4
above.

3.7. Logging Flight Time for Pay. Credit only flight time logged according to Paragraph 3.3
toward incentive pay requirements. Flight time flown in "O" or "X" status does not
entitle the member to OFDA credit, ACIP or HDIP. NOTE: See Attachment 2, Table A2.3.
EXCEPTION: Air Technicians (AT) and Air Reserve Technicians (ART) must be in military
status to log time for incentive pay. This Air Force Instruction and MAJCOMs define the inflight
duties that qualify individuals for ACIP, CEFIP, or HDIP.
   3.7.1. Logging Flight Time by Rated Officers and CEAs Who are Qualified in One
   Aircraft and Not Other Types of Aircraft Assigned to Their Units. MAJCOMS and
   equivalent organizations, and subordinate organizations, may authorize commanders
   (including unit commanders) and key supervisors (API 6, 8, B, or D) who are qualified and
   maintain currency in one type aircraft, but have other types assigned to their units, to fly in a
   primary crew position in assigned aircraft in which they are not qualified. Individuals will be
   under the supervision of an instructor for the applicable crew position. The crewmember will
   log an "O" or "X" as the aircrew qualification code first character and his or her assigned
   second character crew position code IAW Table A2.3 (As noted above, Flight time flown in
   "O" or "X" status does not entitle the member to OFDA credit, ACIP or HDIP.) See also
   paragraph 3.4.1.1.1. Members who fly IAW this paragraph will log all applicable flight
   time, to include combat or combat support time (see paragraph 3.4.6.3).
   3.7.1. (PACAF) Rated/key supervisors unqualified in the aircraft will log ―other‖ time.
   Para 2.14.1.1.of this supplement also applies.
3.8. Logging Flight Time by Rated Officers and Career Enlisted Aviators in Inactive
Flying Status. Personnel in such status do not log flying time in their specialty in US
Government aircraft except as provided in FAC waivers listed in Table 2.2, paragraphs 2.9.2.2,
2.10.1.1, and 2.16. In all such cases, inactive crewmembers must maintain physical and
physiological qualification (if applicable) for aviation service.
3.9. Non-rated Crewmembers and Operational Support Flight Time. Inflight
duties authorized by Air Force and MAJCOM instructions determine the proper flying duty or
position symbol for logging flight time on AFTO Form 781. This flying time is accomplished
when actively performing inflight duties as follows:
   3.9.1. Non-rated Crewmember Duty. When on AOs and properly assigned to an
   authorized non-rated aircrew position as part of the regularly constituted crew IAW AFIs 11 -
   401, 11-402, and 65-503, and:
       3.9.1.1. The individual‗s primary duty requires the performance of inflight duties on a
       frequent and regular basis.
       3.9.1.2. The approved inflight duties are essential to operating aircraft systems and
       associated equipment required for mission accomplishment.
   3.9.2. Operational Support (Non-crewmember) Duty. Members are placed on AOs for a
   specified time and must be properly authorized to perform inflight duties not prescribed in
   AFI 65-503 and to supplement a regularly constituted aircrew. They are on flight status for
   limited periods to perform essential and specific in-flight duties that cannot be accomplished
   by authorized aircrew personnel. Refer to AFI 11-402 for guidance.
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                     95


3.10. Logging Flight Time in Non-US Air Force Aircraft. Only members performing inflight
duties authorized by Paragraph 1.11 may log flying time in non-Air Force aircraft for credit
towards OFDA requirements or incentive pay. Otherwise only "Other" flight time wi ll be
credited in an individual‗s flight records.
3.11. Logging Other US Military Time. Total career flight time obtained in the service of
other US military agencies when not officially directed by the Air Force, and when verified by
logbook or other official records certified by authorized persons. This time will be entered into
ARMS in the Other US Military hour block. Time obtained in other US military aircraft is not
included in this category if performed in an official capacity (e.g., directed by competent Air
Force order); such time is recorded as Air Force rated time.
3.11. (PACAF)Logging Other US Military Time. For Inter-Service transfer members, HARM
must obtain an official military document to update ―Other US Military Time‖ in the career total
field in ARMS. Do not enter time in as individual aircraft.
3.12. Logging Student Time. Total career flight time acquired by rated trainees in USAF or
USAF-directed undergraduate flight training prior to attaining a rating. This time will be entered
into ARMS in the student time hour block.
3.13. Logging Foreign Military Time. Total career flight time obtained in the service of other
governments when not officially directed by the Air Force, and when verified by logbook or
other official record certified by authorized persons. This time will be entered into ARMS in the
Foreign Military hour block.
3.14. Logging Flight Time in Other Than Military Aircraft. Flight time logged according to
Paragraph 3.3 in other than military aircraft is credited toward annual flying requirements only
when directed by competent Air Force AOs and such flying is inherent in the primary duty
assignment of the person concerned. Aircrews must document flight time on an AFTO Form 781
or AF Form 3250 and, except for CAP-USAF or Introductory Flying Training missions, be in
aircraft with 450 or more rated horsepower.
3.15. Logging Civilian Flight Time. Total career flight time acquired in civilian aircraft of 450
or more rated horsepower, when verified by logbook or other official record certified by
authorized persons. (These authorized persons are operations officers of military aviation
activities; suitable agents of commercial aviation companies; operating managers of fields from
which the reported flying was performed, if in privately owned aircraft; and officials of
recognized civil flight schools.) This time will be entered into ARMS in the civilian hour block.
3.16. Quarterly General Officer Flying Hour Information Report. MAJCOMs will submit
Quarterly GO Flying Hour Information Report (RCS: HAF -A3O[Q]0702) via message to HQ
USAF/A3OT by the 15of the month following each calendar quarter. This report is designated
emergency status code C-3. Submit data requirements as prescribed, but they may be delayed to
allow the submission of higher precedence reports. Continue reporting during emergency
conditions, delayed precedence. Discontinue reporting during MINIMIZE. The report will
include the following:
   3.16.1. Rank/Name/Position. Include general officer selectees.
   3.16.2. Aircraft qualification/aircrew status.
   3.16.3. Flight Authorization Duty Codes.

support, and authorized non-interference members on AOs,        who are qualified and required to
perform duties on specific aircraft for a scheduled mission.    MEP may be placed on the flight
authorization, only in the Remarks section. AE/PJ FAs are       attached to the aircraft FA for the
mission(s) on which they performed duties.
Form—Term used to identify Air Force forms and IMTs (Information Management Tools).
IAW AFI 33-360, the IMT designator is being phased out; it is not used in this publication.
Frequent And Regular—"Frequent and regular" is a DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, Part Two,
term which establishes the minimum monthly flight requirements to be entitled to conditional
Aviation Career Incentive Pay (ACIP), Career Enlisted Flight Incentive Pay (CEFIP), or

each flying base for determining entitlement and the starting and stopping of Aviation Career
Incentive Pay (ACIP), Career Enlisted Flier Incentive Pay (CEFIP), and Haza rdous Duty
Incentive Pay (HDIP) for flying and parachute duties; responsible for interpreting public law as it
pertains to entitlement to these incentive pays along with auditing and reconciliation of these
incentive pays; and the single point of contact for ARMS. This position is inherently
governmental.
Instrument Flight—Flight conducted when external conditions require that the aircraft attitude
be maintained primarily by reference to the flight instruments.
Intent—For the purpose of publishing an Aeronautical Order, the intent of an AO is to validate
individual qualification for aviation and/or parachutist service, authorize and direct frequent and
regular participation in aerial flight or parachute duties; and establish or terminate individual
entitlement to ACIP, CEFIP, and HDIP. Intent also includes the effective date of the AO.
Interfly—The exchange and/or substitution of aircrews and aircraft between MAJCOMs.
Mission—For the purpose of this instruction only, mission is defined as a primary objective for
which an aircraft is operated (see Mission Symbols) and which may consist of an increment of
one or more sorties. Several missions may be accomplished in one sortie. See.
Mission Essential Ground Personnel (MEGP)—(DELETED).
Mission Essential Personnel (MEP)—personnel who are required for the execution of the
aircraft or unit mission, to include follow-on missions. Includes additional aircrew members
required for follow-on missions (may be further defined in MAJCOM supplements to this
instruction) and personnel not authorized AOs who are tasked to perform ground support duties
at enroute locations or destination points that are directly related and essential to accomplishment
of the aircraft or unit mission, e.g. a specialist or technician required to provide aircraft support
or a security team required to guard the aircraft. MEP may include military staff personnel and
U.S. Government employees when those individuals are required for the mission. MAJCOMs
may further define MEP in supplements to this instruction but guidance may not be less
restrictive than the guidance contained herein. The OG/CC (or equivalent) with operational
control of the aircraft grants MEP status. ( EXCEPTIONS: For AMC missions already in the
system,         the TACC Senior           Controller      may approve MEP status. MAJCOM
Standardization/Evaluation Chiefs may approve MEP status for MAJCOM or MAJCOM -gained
missions for evaluators assigned to the MAJCOM.) If operational control transfers, the OG/CC
(or equivalent) who assumes follow-on operational control may continue/revise MEP status
(coordinate changes with originating authority). MAJCOMs may establish intra -command and
inter-command guidance to facilitate this process. MEP, to include additional crewmembers who
fly in MEP status, are passengers and may only fly in aircraft capable of carrying
passengers IAW the provisions of DoD 4515.13-R. (EXCEPTION: MEP who are mission
essential to aircraft launch/ recovery may fly on aircraft not normally equipped for carrying
passengers. MEP who fly under the provisions of this exception must be physically
and physiologically [when required] qualified and must complete applicable egress training prior
to flight.)
Officer Service Date (OSD)—Effective date of service as a commissioned, warrant, or flight
officer, whether or not served on extended active duty. This is usually equivalent to total federal
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                       107


commissioned service date backdated by any period served as a warrant or flight officer. For
flight surgeons, the OSD includes constructive service granted medical officers in the
computation of creditable service for basic pay.

(primarily for mission, support, or training purposes) while serving in an assignment where basic
flying skills usually are maintained for performing assigned duties.
Operational Support Flier—An individual whose primary, full-time duty does not require
flying. The Air Force may require these individuals to fly on an occasional basis to perform a
specific, essential inflight duty that cannot be performed by an assigned aircrew member. Duties
may include, but are not limited to inflight test, operation, or inflight maintenance of specific
aircraft systems or installed equipment. To receive non-crew hazardous duty pay, operational
support fliers must be placed on aeronautical orders and complete prescribed flying hour
requirements. Authorized man-months are required prior to issuance of aeronautical orders.
Orientation Flight—Continuous flights in DoD-owned aircraft performed within the local
flying area and terminating at the point of origin. See also paragraph and .
Pilot In Command—The aircrew member designated by competent authority as being in
command of an aircraft and responsible for its safe operation and accomplishment of the
assigned mission.
Point-To-Point—Point-to-point means flights that takeoff from one location and land at a
different location. Point-to-point orientation flights are not authorized.
Sortie—An AFTO Form 781 aircraft sortie begins when the aircraft begins to move forward on
takeoff or takes off vertically from rest at any point of support. It ends after airborne flight when
the aircraft returns to the surface and either of the following conditions occur: a) the engines are
stopped, or the aircraft is on the surface for five minutes, whichever occurs first; or, b) a change
is made in the crew which enplanes or deplanes a crewmember. For logging aircrew proficiency
training, on missions during which some crewmembers deplane and the remaining crew from the
original takeoff re-launch, this may be considered to be a continuation of the original aircrew
sortie. MAJCOMs may establish MDS-specific crew requirements and procedures for aircrew
continuation sorties.
STANAG 3526 AMD—Interchangeability of NATO Aircrew Medical Categories.
Supervisory Aircrew Or Staff Member—Personnel in supervisory or staff positions (API 6, 8,
B, and D) who actively fly; or in positions (API 3, 4, C, and E) that require aircrew expertise but
individuals are not required to fly.
Training Level—Assigned to individuals based on the continuation training aircrew status
(basic aircraft qualification, basic mission capable, or mission ready/combat mission ready) they
are required to maintain.
Training Period—Any training period determined by the MAJCOM or Wing in which training
requirements are performed.
Unit Commander—When used in this instruction, "unit commander" refers to the squadron
commander (or comparable level) or higher level within the chain of command.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING AFTO FORM 781, ARMS AIRCREW/MISSION FLIGHT
                         DATA DOCUMENT

A2.1. Purpose. The AFTO Form 781-series provides maintenance, inspection, service
configuration, and flight operations records for weapon or support systems. AFTO Form 781,
ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, is the source document for recording and
reporting operational flight or training device information for each individual authorized to take
part in a mission. This form is the primary record of both personnel and aerospace vehicle flying
hours. It is the official record to validate flight pay eligibility for rated, CEA, and other non -
rated officer and enlisted members required to fly. The original AFTO Form 781 must be
maintained in the HARM office that services the unit to which the aircraft is assigned. This form
is available for downloading on the e-publishing website at www.e-publishing.af.mil.
A2.2. Scope. These instructions apply to all members authorized to log flight or training device
time in an airborne duty or position for the purpose of maintaining an official Air Force Flight
Record.
A2.3. Responsibilities. The AFTO Form 781 is established by TO 00-20-1. In most cases,
maintenance personnel are responsible for distributing and collecting these forms. Completing
the AFTO Form 781 and other forms in the series is a joint responsibility of maintenance
personnel and the pilot in command.
   A2.3.1. The crew chief or alternate ensures a sufficient number of copies of AFTO Form
   781 are onboard the aircraft and completes items 2 through 5 on a sufficient number of
   copies to fulfill mission requirements. If the forms are generated in advance, the pilot in
   command will confirm with maintenance personnel the correct data for items 2 and 3.

            terminated without landing for a change in mission symbol, enter "INFL." Use
            ―XXXX‖ for classified locations or locations without an official ICAO identifier.

11          24-hour GMT clock time. The takeoff time is when the aircraft begins to move
            forward on takeoff roll.
112                                    AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


ITEM   ENTER
12     24-hour GMT clock time. The landing is when the aircraft is on the ground after
       being airborne and any of the following conditions occur: (a) The engines a re
       stopped and shutdown occurs at or before five minutes after touchdown. (b) The
       aircraft has been on the ground for five minutes after touchdown; however, a series
       of practice landings is considered one flight. (c) A change is made in the crew where a
       crewmember enplanes or deplanes. NOTE: When a flight starts before 2400 GMT
       and ends after GMT midnight (2400Z), record and report the flight on the date of
       takeoff. A separate AFTO Form 781 is not necessary.
13     Subtract takeoff time from landing time. Use the conversion table to the right to
       convert to hours and tenths, and enter the result.
14     Number of touch-and-go, full stop, and total landings.
15     Number of sorties accomplished. A sortie covers a flight from first take off to
       landing as described in block 12; however, if any flight entry is split (INFL), the
       sortie will be recorded on the flight that lists final landing.
16     Special use as specified by MAJCOM.
17     Flight authorization number generated in the SARM as specified in AFI 11 -421.
       (MAJCOM option.)
18     Unit issuing the flight authorization and designated to perform this mission (MAJCOM
       option).
TOTALS Sum of flight sequences ―a‖ through ―f‖ for total flight time, landings, and sorties at
       the end of the mission.
19     Four-digit unit number to which the crewmember is assigned/attached for flying
       purposes. Use leading zeros when the unit number has fewer than four digits.
20     Last four digits of the SSN of the crewmember. An error in this entry will result in
       time being lost or credited to another crewmember.
21     Crewmember‗s last name (printed). May use additional characters if another
       member in the unit has the same last name.

22         Flight Authorization (FA) Duty Code assigned on the FA to the crewmember for this
           mission. This code cannot be higher than the individual‗s current qualification, but will indicate
           duties that the individual crewmember is scheduled to perform on the mission. For
           example, if the individual is an IP, but is scheduled to perform MP duties on a mission,
           the individual will be listed as an MP on the Flight Authorization. Refer to Table A2.3
           for a complete list of duty codes. NOTE: The only time the FA code will not match
           the scheduled duties on the FA is for extenuating circumstances. The AC must
           document the reason in the remarks of the AFTO Form 781. For example, a pilot was
           scheduled to perform IP duties in conjunction with upgrade training for a second pilot;
           however, the upgrading individual was DNIF and did not fly, so the pilot only
           performed primary duties. MP is logged with primary time and the AC documents the
           reason in the remarks section. When using the FA more than one day, log FA Duty
           Code actually performed a nd annotate in remarks if different from the FA.


23-28      Times in hours and tenths for each category as defined in Chapter 3 of this
           instruction. The total time in item 28 cannot exceed the grand total in item 13 and

             sorties, the pilot in command initials for each sortie sequence. If the pilot in
             command changes during multiple sorties, the individual who acted as pilot in
             command for a particular sortie must initial in the sortie block. If the pilot in
             command changes during any single sortie, the last individual to act as pilot in
             command for that sortie will initial the sortie block.
 41         Initials of the unit operations officer or Aviation Resource Manager (ARM) who
            verifies the accuracy and legibility of the form prior to entry into ARMS.
 42         Date (e.g., 22 Sep 2008) and initials of the ARM who input and audited the form.
 43         Date (e.g., 22 Sep 2008) and initials of the ARM who audited and processed the

A2.4. Extract AFTO Form 781. Each individual on the form whose flight records are
maintained by another HARM office prepares a data extract photocopy of the original AFTO
Form 781 to be sent, usually within five duty-days, to that member‗s HARM office. If more than
one individual named on the form is serviced by the HARM office, a single data extract copy
may be used. For example Captain Grengs, a pilot from Minot AFB, flew a mission at Grand
Forks AFB. A photocopy of the AFTO Form 781 is made, certified in item 43, and sent to the
HARM office at Minot. Extracts at the same base for aircrew members serviced by the same
HARM office are not authorized.
   A2.4.1. Individuals whose flight records have been closed out to transfer custody must
   prepare a data extract form for each authorized flight during that period.
   A2.4.2. The data extract AFTO Form 781 is an exact copy of the original AFTO Form 781.
A2.4.3. Upon receipt of an extract, member's servicing SARM/HARM personnel will lightly
line through individual mission data lines of members not in the local ARMS database, leaving
only the members they will enter in ARMS. The SARM office responsible for management of
the original AFTO Form 781 will have a line lightly drawn through members who were extracted
(not from aircraft's home station).
   A2.4.4. The data extract form is so identified and certified in item 43, either by a
   commissioned officer (preferably the pilot in command), a government civilian (when pilot
   in command), or by the HARM Chief/ Superintendent.

   A2.6.6. Flight Authorization Duty Codes. Flight authorization duty codes identify the
   aircrew member‗s flight duty status. They are four (or more) letter codes and MAJCOMs
   have the option to specify the third, fourth and any additional characters.

       A2.6.6.1. (Added-PACAF) The first character of the Flight Authorization Duty Code
       indicates the type of duty crewmembers are authorized to perform on a particular
       mission. This will not necessarily be the crewmember‘s highest crew qualification,
       unless specifically required by the mission profile. For example, in a dual-place aircraft
       two fully current and qualified instructor pilots, neither crewmember would be assigned a
       Flight Authorization Duty Code of ―IP,‖ nor log Instructor Time. However, when
       authorized to perform instructor duties, crewmembers will only log Instructor Time for
       the actual time those duties are performed, not the entire duration of the flight.

NOTE:
1. Log their flight time using both an aircrew certification code and position identifier valid to
credit time (a "yes" in column 3).
2. Log primary, secondary or instructor flight time. Evaluator flight time is also creditable when
the evaluator is current in the aircraft. Otherwise the evaluator should use the aircrew
certification code O or X.
3. Be attaining or maintaining qualification in the aircraft.
4. Operational support fliers must log primary time to meet the requirement for HDIP. When not
performing primary duties, they will log other time. Operational Support medical technicians
on AOs will only log primary time when performing in -flight medical assistance to actual
patients. Only other time is authorized for periods of the mission when medical assistance is not
being provided. EXCEPTION: AFSPC and AETC medics will log primary time for that
portion of the mission when they perform required temporary CEA duties on aircraft equipment
(hoists and litters).
5. Non-interference flyers (other than flying unit commanders and UAS sensor operators) must
receive HQ USAF/A3OT approval to log flying time on AFTO Form 781 and enter data into
ARMS. See paragraphs 3.3.1.5.2. and 3.3.1.5.3..
6. Rated officers and CEAs will log second character crew position ―Z‖ when tasked to
perform in-flight non-crew duties (e.g. safety observer). Include a remark on the back side of the
AFTO Form 781 to explain the duty performed.
NOTE: MAJCOMs may specify additional characters and may provide supplemental
guidance.

A2.7. (Added-PACAF) USAF Flying Hour Program.
  A2.7.1. (Added-PACAF) Operations is charged with the overall accountability of the
  USAF Flying Hour Execution Program from allocation, through execution, to reporting back
  to their respective MAJCOM Flying Hour Program Manager.
  A2.7.2. (Added-PACAF) Wing Current Operations will ensure squadron SARMs on a
  daily basis will reconcile their daily aircraft utilization reports (AURs), utilizing the AFTO
  Forms 781 as a source document, with maintenance debrief, which inputs the top half of the
  AFTO Form 781 into the Core Automated Maintenance System (CAMS) database. If there
  are any discrepancies between operations (SARM) and maintenance debrief, the
  discrepancies should be reconciled the next duty day or as soon as possible. This process
  should be carried over until the end of the month, but keep in mind that CAMS cut-off date is
  the fourth day of the following month. In addition, the SARM will validate the EOM flying
  hour totals with Maintenance Plans and Scheduling (P&S) not later than the third day after
  the close out of a given month.
  A2.7.3. (Added-PACAF) Once all flying hours/sorties have been validated and corrected
  for current month, squadron SARMs and P&S will send their EOM flying hour reports to
  Wing Operations by the fifth day of each month for consolidation.

                         PREPARING AERONAUTICAL ORDERS

A3.1. AO Purpose. AOs are:
A3.1.1. Published on AF Form 1887, or in an approved computer output format, AOs are used
to validate individual qualification for aviation and parachutist service; to authorize and direct
individual performance of duty that involves frequent and regular participa tion in aerial
flight or parachute duties; to authorize and direct individuals (non -aircrew) to perform non-
interference flying duties; and to establish or terminate individual entitlement to aviation career
incentive pay (ACIP), career enlisted flyer incentive pay (CEFIP), and hazardous duty incentive
pay (HDIP). HDIP for parachutists must specify static or HALO jump requirement and type of
HDIP authorized. AOs initiating and authorizing aviation/parachutist service will not be
effective before the member is medically qualified. This form is available for
downloading on the e-publishing website at www.e-publishing.af.mil.
   A3.1.2. Maintained in individual FRFs/JRFs to provide a complete chronological history of
   each individual‗s aviation/parachutist career. A record set will be maintained in the HARM
   office file system until moved to staging area.
   A3.1.3. Distributed according to Table A3.2.
   A3.1.4. Completed according to Table A3.1 through Table A3.4.
   A3.1.5. Signed by the wing Host Aviation Resource Manager (HARM). The wing
   HARM must be an Aviation Resource Management SNCO (E -7 or above/civilian equivalent
   [GS-6] or E-7/GS-7 or above for ANG) with a seven (7) skill level, with at least
   three years experience in the 1C0 career field, a current CHARM qualification, and SEI
   Code 066. NOTE: The MAJCOM 1C0 Functional Manager may waive this requirement.
   All waiver requests will include full justification, proof of member‗s qualification (copy of
   1C0 training record AO task certification), and expected get well date. Send an
   information copy to AF/A3O-ATF for waivers approved for longer than 180 days.
       A3.1.5.1. With approval of the MAJCOM 1C0 Functional Manager and subject to the
       qualification requirements listed in Paragraph A3.1.5, the assistant CHARM may sign
       aeronautical orders on behalf of the CHARM. Additionally, the statement "Signed for"
       must be written or typed above the signature block and the assistant CHARM will sign
       his or her name above the CHARM‗s signature block. The MAJCOM 1C0 Functional
       Manager will document this approval.
A3.2. AO Publication. Publish AOs for:
   A3.2.1. Officers and CEAs qualified for an aviation career (restricted to rated officers,
   officers in flying training leading to award of an aeronautical rating, or enlisted members in
   flying training leading to the CEA designation) to:
       A3.2.1.1. Start or stop the requirement to perform operational flight/jump duty.
       A3.2.1.2. Direct and record changes to ASC and incentive pay entitlement. When
       the AO initiates or terminates flight/jump pay at the same time as the ASC change,
       complete the bottom portion of the AO. This serves as a Military Pay Order (MPO) to
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                       125


       start and stop flight/jump incentive pay. HARM offices will use a DD Form 114 to start
       and stop past or future entitlements based on qualifications or actions not applicable to
       the current AO. MPOs may be cut as separate documents to control privacy act
       information contained in aeronautical order remarks section.
   A3.2.2. Members (officer and enlisted) not qualified for an aviation/parachutist career to:
A3.2.2.1. Initiate or terminate member‗s requirement to perform regular and frequent flight as
a crewmember.
       A3.2.2.2. Direct and record changes to ASC, FAC 4, 5, 6, 8, and E duties and incentive
       pay entitlement.
       A3.2.2.3. Establish or terminate member‗s requirement to perform frequent and regular
       parachute jump duties as a parachutist member.
       A3.2.2.4. Initiate operational support and non-interference flying. Once AO
       terminates, it is no longer in effect. Do not publish an AO to terminate aviation service
       for these members.
       A3.2.2.5. Track members required to perform UAV sensor operator
       duties. Termination date will be three years from the AO effective date or member‗s
       DOS, whichever occurs first. The AO will read as follows: ―Initiate Sensor Operator
       Duties‖.
   A3.2.3. Award authorized basic ratings and badges. AOs that award aeronautical ratings,
   aircrew member badges, and parachutist ratings are single-action orders. NOTE: Do not
   publish an AO to award advanced ratings or badges. HARM personnel will validate
   advanced ratings/badge criteria was satisfied IAW AFI 11 -402 and update advanced
   ratings/badges in ARMS only. The day the information is updated in ARMS is the effective
   date for award of an advanced rating/badge. NOTE: HARM offices may publish AOs for
   professionally qualified government civilian employees using AF Form 1887. Do not publish
   AOs for qualified members of other US military or foreign services (unless in UFT), or
   government contractors. Place all members on the unit‗s flight authorization. (See
   paragraph 1.8). Validate US military and foreign service members have competent orders
   (AOs) from their respective service directing them to perform flying duties. HARM offices
   may enter other US military, foreign service, government contractor, or government civilian
   members in ARMS for the purpose of tracking aircrew training and physical/physiological
   qualifications when the member will perform flying duties on a frequent basis.
A3.3. General Instructions.
   A3.3.1. The HARM office prepares AOs IAW this instruction and inputs from unit HARM
   offices, commanders (including unit commanders) and AF/A3O -AT.
       A3.3.1.1. Number AOs in sequential order, starting with number one for each fiscal year.
       Cite, above the heading of the first order of a year, the number of the last order published
       the previous year. For example: "FY06. Last AO was #2140."
           A3.3.1.1.1. A record set of AOs contains all orders published during a fiscal year, to
           include regular, amendment and revocation orders. Each order number must be
           accounted for (log required), from the first order through the last order published for
           that fiscal year. Multiple logs and numbers (with letters added) are not authorized.
126                                 AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


         A3.3.1.1.2. A separate file of background material (from official sources)
         which supports each order‗s publication must be maintained for each fiscal year
         IAW AFMAN 37-123. Annotate (in ink) the background material in the lower right -
         hand corner (bottom margin of page) to show the order number to which it pertains.
         For example: ―Supporting document (or background material) for AO # 0469, dated
         15 Dec 2005‖.
             A3.3.1.1.2.1. Source documents include information from personnel database
             interfaces, military identification cards, finance system documents, re-enlistment
             papers, etc. Do not use documents that transferred dates or information from one
             source document to another—use the source. If using information logged on a
             member‗s in-processing or out-processing checklist, for example DDLDS or
             Effective Date of Duty to process AOs, the HARM office will request a MILPDS
             interface and validate the data for processing the AO.
         A3.3.1.1.3. Post each amendment AO to the HARM office record set and
         FRF/JRF. Post revocation AOs to the HARM office record set only. Enter an
         explanation in ink on the left margin of the original order. For example: "Revoked by
         AO #2424, dated 18 Sep 05."
      A3.3.1.2. Confirm verbal orders (in writing) within three duty-days. Include in
      the written order the date and by whom the verbal order was issued and, if flying/jump
      status or aeronautical ratings/badges were affected, a statement why writt en orders were
      not issued earlier. For example, "The verbal orders of the commander on (date)
      are confirmed; circumstances prevented written orders in advance."
  A3.3.2. Unit commanders will notify the HARM office to request aviation or parachutist
  service actions that originate at the unit level. For example: Initiating aviation/parachutist
  service, non-interference flying, or operational support requests.
  A3.3.3. The host base Information Management (IM) office will provide reproduction
  facilities for publishing AOs when facilities are not available within the HARM office.
  A3.3.4. HARM offices may publish a single aeronautical order affecting several members
  providing the action is exactly the same for each member. For group order s, mask
  information protected under the Privacy Act of 1974 (SSNs) to prevent unauthorized
  disclosure.
  A3.3.5. A single AO may be published directing several actions that pertain to an individual,
  provided all actions have the same effective and t ermination dates. EXCEPTION: AOs
  awarding basic or advanced aeronautical ratings or badges do not contain other actions.
  A3.3.6. Use AF Form 1887 or ARMS AO to amend or revoke a previous AO.
      A3.3.6.1. Amend AOs to correct minor administrative errors (erroneous SSN, improper
      grade, termination date, misspelled name, etc.), if the intent of the original order is
      unaffected by the correction. The amendment order should contain the original effective
      date and only other required identifying data (name, grade, SSN, and organization) and
      the amended data. If other personal data is the same as the AO being amended (ASD,
      ASC, FAC, etc.), it may also be included on the AO. Underline amended items and
      reference the amended item(s) in the AO remarks.(An amendment makes the
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                   127


       amended order read as it should have initially.) An AF Form 1887 is the recommended
       medium for amending AO because, as an automated system, ARMS automatically
       includes current information that may not be applicable for the effective period of the AO
       being amended. This information may be included if it mirrors the AO being amended.
       Use of AF Form 1887 avoids HARM system "work-arounds" that entail entering false
       date into ARMS. False data may interface with other Air Force systems and corrupt
       promotion or assignment processes.
          A3.3.6.1.1. HARM offices may use a single amendment AO to correct erroneous
          data on more than one AO if the data to be changed is the same on each incorrect AO.
          EXAMPLE: A HARM office does not amend the ASD and termination date on AOs
          following an ASD adjustment. This may be corrected by publishing one AO to
          correct the ASD and termination date and listing each AO number that required
          correction in the remarks section of the amendment AO.
          A3.3.6.1.2. Do not publish an amendment order to another amendment order. Revoke
          the incorrect amendment and publish a single correct amendment.
          A3.3.6.1.3. Amending a termination date is TI
          A3.3.6.1.4. HARM offices will not amend an AO to correct an effective
          date. Since the intent of a published AO is that the AO is valid from the beginning
          (effective date), an incorrect AO effective date invalidates that AO from the
          beginning. HARM offices must revoke the AO and publish a new AO with the
          correct effective date and the required aviation service change.
          A3.3.6.1.5. (Added) HARM offices will not amend an AO to correct an erroneous
          OFDA total or FAC unless the AO was published to mark an aviation service point,
          e.g. 12 years of aviation service, or to assign FAC 6/E, respectively.
          A3.3.6.1.6. (Added) HARM offices will not amend a past AO solely to correct an
          erroneous authority paragraph reference. The authority paragraph reference must be
          correct on the member‗s current AO.
       A3.3.6.2. Do not rescind AOs. Action taken on a later AO supersedes only the same
       item on previous orders. Previously awarded items on an order maintain the same
       effective date. Example: MSgt Jones", (ASC 9D) aeronautical order (AO) will
       terminate 27 December 2005. However, MSgt Jones reenlists on 15 Dec 2005, and will
       remain on active flying status. An AO must be printed to reflect the new termination date
       based on the new DOS; the effective date of the new AO will remain the same as the
       original AO that placed MSgt Jones on flying status.
A3.3.6.3. Revoke an order when it is void and without effect from the beginning. (A revocation
deletes the order from the chronological history in the member‗s FRF or JRF.) However, the
revoked AO must be filed with the record set background material of AOs to support the AO
being published. When an AO is revoked, it no longer exists as an official document. Do not
revoke a revocation; instead, publish a new order. For Example: When the HARM office
publishes AO #2424 to r evoke AO #444. Remove AO #444 from the FRF and file AO
#2424 in the HARM office record set. Document revoked information on the lower left-
hand side margin of revoked AO. For Example: Revoked by AO #167, dated 18 Jan 03. HARM
offices must send a copy of both AOs to the member and AFPC/DPAOY. AFPC/DPAOY
 128                                  AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


maintains a permanent file in member‗s historical file to show all aviation service actions
processed.
A3.4. Restrictions on Publication.
   A3.4.1. Do not publish an AO to authorize Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) or Air
   National Guard (ANG) personnel to take part in flight activity during short periods of EAD.
   EXCEPTION: AOs will be published for AFRC and ANG personnel while attending the
   Flight Screening Program.
   A3.4.2. The AO effective date will not precede the date the member met all eligibility
   requirements.
   A3.4.3. Prior to publication of an AO that will involuntarily terminate aviation service for
   non-CEA enlisted aircrew members, the HARM office must ensu re the member was given a
   120-day notification before removal from aviation service (IAW AFI 11 -402). Receipt of
   assignment notification documentation from the MPF, as directed by AFI 36 -2102,Base-
   Level Relocation Procedures, verbal orders of the member‗s unit commander (written
   confirmation must be received within three duty-days), or any official documentation
   received from AF/A3O-AT constitutes certification and will be noted in remarks of the
   published order. Place MPFs on distribution for all such AOs.
   A3.4.4. AOs should not be published later than the effective date if the action changes,
   initiates, or terminates incentive pay entitlement or OFDA, unless:
       A3.4.4.1. The AO confirms an ASC change as a result of PCS. In this case, the
       effective date is the day after the member signs out from the losing organization, as
       provided by the MPF. A retroactive statement is not necessary for this action. HARM
       offices will verify DDLDS documented on the member‗s in-processing sheet with
       MILPDS data.A3.4.4.2. The AO involves circumstances where a directive establishes an
       effective date of AO. Cite the governing directive that applies as authority.

                 ARMS AIRCREW/MISSION FLIGHT DATA EXTRACT

A4.1. Purpose. The AF Form 3520 is the source document for recording and reporting flight
training and space shuttle/space station information for each individual authorized to take part in
missions. This form is primarily used for aircrew members attending qualification school or
aircrew logging space time. Aircrew who fly operational missions off-station will use/make an
exact copy of the original AFTO Form 781, certify this as a true extract, and turn in the
form/copy to their HARM or SARM office for updating in ARMS. This is an official record to
validate flight pay eligibility for rated, CEA, and other non-rated officer and enlisted members
required to fly while TDY. This form will not be used for flights involving combat/combat
support operations. The original AF For m 3520,ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Extract,
must be maintained in the HARM office that services the unit to which the member is assigned.
This form is available for downloading on the e-publishing website at                     www.e-
publishing.af.mil.
A4.2. Scope. The instructions listed on the reverse side of the AF Form 3520 apply to all rated,
CEA, and other non-rated officer and enlisted members authorized to log flight time while
attending training to attain qualification in an aircraft or training device and t o log authorized
flights in non-USAF aircraft (includes space shuttle and space station) for the purpose of
maintaining an official Air Force Individual Flight Record. Source documents used to transfer
flight data from non-USAF aircraft are maintained as source documents IAW AFMAN 37 -139.
A4.3. Responsibilities. SARM/HARM office personnel are responsible for distributing and
collecting these forms. Completing the AF Form 3520 is a responsibility of the aircrew member.

     INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING AF FORM 4327, ARMS FIGHTER FLIGHT
 AUTHORIZATION, AND AF FORM 4327A, CREW FLIGHT AUTHORIZATION (FA)

A5.1. Purpose. Unit commanders will use the AF Forms 4327 and 4327a to authorize the use
of USAF aircraft to perform a specific mission(s), and to authorize aircrew members required to
perform in-flight duties. Use the AF Form 4327 to authorize flights of utility, fighter, and trainer
aircraft for missions that originate and end at the same location. Use the AF Form 4327a to
authorize all other aircraft missions and for fighters/trainers (if desired). These are critical
documents used during mission review to validate duties performed/logged on the AFTO Form
781, and for reimbursement of temporary duty expenses. Forms are available for downloading on
the e-publishing website at www.e-publishing.af.mil.
   A5.1.1. Additional members authorized to fly, who are not required to perform aircrew
   duties (except for noninterference fliers, and MEP when specifically authorized [see
   paragraph A5.1.3]) must be listed on a passenger manifest.
   A5.1.2. The FA accounts for aircrew personnel required/authorized to perform in -
   flight aircrew duties and the passenger manifest lists all additional members approved to fly
   on the aircraft, but not performing specific aircrew duties on that mission. MEP and
   non- interference fliers not on AOs may be listed on the FA, in the Remarks section; if not
   listed on the FA, these individuals will be placed on the passenger manifest. The FA and
   passenger manifest combined account for all personnel on the aircraft.
   A5.1.3. Units may use computer-generated programs to produce AF Forms 4327/4327a in
   lieu of the actual form program. If used, computer -generated forms must duplicate AF forms
   located at the AFDPO e-publishing web site.
A5.2. Scope. These instructions apply to all flying unit commanders with operational control of
USAF aircraft who direct the use of aircraft and aircrews in support of command operations; and
AE, pararescue unit and ANG Senior Scout unit commanders who publish AE/PJ/Senior Scout
flight authorizations for aircrew members assigned to their units who are required to perform
aircrew duties on the mission.
A5.3. Responsibilities. AF Forms 4327 and 4327a are established by this instruction. Aviation
Resource Management personnel are responsible for publication of these forms and performing
Go/No-Go validation (review of ARMS products and member‗s AOs) during pre-mission
review.
   A5.3.1. When additional aircrew members are added after completion of the FA, the
   authenticating official, pilot in command, or flight lead must confirm Go/No -Go
   requirements are accomplished by validating ARMS training products and AOs prior to
   flight.
   A5.3.2. The completed FA and the AFTO Form 781 will be used during post mission review
   to ensure proper documentation and accounting for all aircrew members authorized to
   perform duties. The pilot in command will document deviations between scheduled duties on
   the FA (Duty Position) and actual duties performed in the remarks of the AFTO Form 781.

command must validate specific mission elements (blocks 1 thru 10) on AE/PJ/Senior Scout
flight authorizations match the aircraft‗s flight authorization for that specific mission.
3. As a minimum, AE/PJ/Senior Scout flight authorizations must contain information in blocks
11 18.
4. The pilot in command must validate all aircrew members listed on the flight authorization(s),
including AE/PJ/Senior Scout aircrew members, are required to perform aircrew duties or are
required to perform specific tasks (non-interference flyers on AOs) by initialing in Block 16.

                                Attachment 7 (Added-PACAF)
                      PACAF ORIENTATION FLIGHT GUIDELINES

A7.1. (Added-PACAF) General. Orientation flights are regulated by DoD 4515.13-R, Air
Transportation Eligibility. These flights are an exceptional use of USAF aircraft, flown only
when the benefits to the USAF are clearly established. These limited resources may be used to
familiarize selected passengers with aircraft capability and employment concepts, and to increase
public understanding and appreciation of USAF roles and missions. Direct all inquiries
concerning the PACAF Orientation Flight Program to HQ PACAF/A3TC, 25 E. ST SUITEG-
317, HICKAM AFB, HI 96853-5426, or telephone DSN 449-8987.
A7.2. (Added-PACAF) Orientation Flights. Orientation flights are a broad category of four
separate types of ―exceptional use‖ flights: Incentive, Distinguished Visitor (DV),
Familiarization (FAM), and Spouse Orientation. Table 1.1. of the basic instruction, as
supplement by PACAF, lists orientation flight eligibility and approval authorities. The approval
authorities indicated have been delegated as listed. If a particular category is not listed, then the
approval authority has not been delegated. Approvals for incentive, DV and spouse orientation
flights are for a one-time flight only. Familiarization flight approvals may include periodic
flights (not to exceed 1 per calendar quarter), but local commanders will ensure specific learning
objectives for each mission are established. Develop local procedures to identify and outline
those objectives, and ensure they are met after each flight.
   A7.2.1. (Added-PACAF) Officers Awaiting PCS Training (APT). APT participants are
   Air Force active duty officers awaiting Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (SUPT).
   These personnel are specifically authorized to receive familiarization flights based on the
   level of preparatory training accomplished prior to such flights. They are authorized an
   unlimited number of familiarization flights, but only if such flights do not adversely effect
   unit ―C‖ rating or create a backlog for other orientation flight programs. Although not
   specifically authorized to fly as MEPs, for administrative purposes, APT participants will be
   included on the Flight Authorization as ―MEP.‖ These individuals will not be included on
   the AFTO Form 781, and will not log flight time.
A7.3. (Added-PACAF) Request Procedures. PACAF/A3TC is the OPR for processing and
directing all orientation flight requests whose approval authority is above NAF level. Requests
requiring approval above NAF level, and all requests requiring SAF/IA and/or foreign disclosure
coordination, must be staffed through the NAF/CC to HQ PACAF/A3TC. Requests requiring
PACAF/A3/5/8 approval must be received at least two weeks before the date of the proposed
flight. If PACAF/CC approval is required, request must be received at least three weeks prior to
the flight. If HHQ approval authority is required, request must be received at least 30 days prior
to flight. Requests not received within the specified time period will not be processed.
   A7.3.1. (Added-PACAF) Submit requests either via hard copy, or by electronic means,
   with an accompanying Staff Summary Sheet (SSS) in Electronic Staff Package (ESP) format.
   Orientation flight requests within PACAF will be submitted to PACAF/A3TC for staffing
   though HQ PACAF. Orientation flight requests within PACAF will be submitted IAW the
   format listed in Attachment A10 of this guidance. The following minimum information must
   be on all requests, regardless of the level of approval required:
 146                                 AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


       A7.3.1.1. (Added-PACAF) Name, grade, nationality, and position of the orientation
       candidates. Flights may be approved for well-defined groups if individual names are not
       known.
       A7.3.1.2. (Added-PACAF) Aircraft Type.
       A7.3.1.3. (Added-PACAF) Unit, location, and type of orientation flight requested (as
       defined in Table 1.1 of the basic AFI, and para A7.2 of this guidance).
       A7.3.1.4. (Added-PACAF) Requested date or time period window for the flight. Allow
       sufficient time for flexibility in scheduling due to weather, distinguished visitor
       schedules, and aircraft availability. The time period window will not exceed six months
       for flights.
       A7.3.1.5. (Added-PACAF) Specific statement of benefit to the USAF or DoD.
       A7.3.1.6. (Added-PACAF) Other relevant comments, such as background of the
       orientation candidate (especially flying background), media coverage, unusual details of
       the planned mission, etc.
       A7.3.1.7. (Added-PACAF) Statement of specific learning objectives for any recurring
       familiarization flights (Reference A7.2.).
   A7.3.2. (Added-PACAF) Unless otherwise directed in this guidance, approvals for all
   categories of orientation flights are one-time only for a specific individual. If a cancelled
   flight (WX, MX, etc.) must be rescheduled for the same individual, re-approval within six
   months of the original signed approval is not required.
Note: Requests approved below MAJCOM level will info the PACAF A3/5/8, CV, or CC as
appropriate.

A7.4. (Added-PACAF) Operating Procedures-All Categories. The following applies to all
categories of orientation flights:
   A7.4.1. (Added-PACAF) Do not publicly offer flights or imply approval until the
   appropriate authority has formally approved the request. Orientation/Familiarization flights
   constitute official military duties for Active Duty, Guard and Reserve members. Due to line-
   of-duty considerations, do not allow any military individual to participate in
   orientation/familiarization flights while on leave, or permissive TDY.
   A7.4.2. (Added-PACAF) Provide orientation flights within approved flying hour program
   limitations. Whenever possible, include flights on regularly scheduled missions, however,
   orientation flights must not interfere with those missions. Fighter orientation flights should
   provide the best training opportunity possible while still keeping the intent of the orientation
   ride in mind. Under no circumstances will incentive orientation flight candidates be allowed
   on fighter sorties consisting of air combat training ((D)BFM, (D)ACM, (D)ACT), or air to
   ground training (BSA/SAT)) unless orientation candidates accomplish the appropriate
   ground training indicated in Table A7.4.7. Refer to the appropriate AFI 11-2MDS
   publication for specific definitions and restrictions covering air combat or surface attack
   missions.
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                  147


  A7.4.3. (Added-PACAF) For flying in ejection seat aircraft, orientation candidates without
  a current AF Form 1042 (or national equivalent), must receive an AF Form 1042 from a
  flight surgeon no earlier than fourteen calendar days before the flight. Minor technically
  disqualifying defects may be subsequently waived by telephone coordination with HQ
  PACAF Flight Medicine Branch (HQ PACAF/SGPF). For non-ejection seat aircraft the
  individual will complete a locally generated health statement IAW AFI 48-123, paragraph
  6.48.8. If civilian or they answer yes to any questions on the health statement, the health
  statement will be sent to the Flight Surgeons Office for review. See Attachment 14 for a
  sample health statement. Individuals having successfully completed physiological training
  will be authorized to engage in familiarization/orientation flights above FL 180 in fighter
  aircraft.
  A7.4.4. (Added-PACAF) Brief all Orientation Flight Passengers IAW the minimum
  Orientation Flight Passenger Briefing Guide. On multi-crew aircraft, the PIC may designate
  another qualified crew member to brief specific items, when the passenger will be under the
  supervision of that crew member (e.g., Loadmasters may brief emergency equipment and
  locations in the cargo compartment). All items will be briefed at the aircraft by the PIC or
  designated crew member. Where appropriate, brief these items after the passenger is
  strapped in.
  A7.4.5. (Added-PACAF) Ensure the passenger is properly strapped in and the oxygen
  system is properly configured and correctly connected. On multi-crew aircraft, the PIC may
  designate another qualified crew member to ensure the passenger is properly strapped in and
  the oxygen system is properly configured and connected anytime the passenger is connected
  to an oxygen system.
  A7.4.6. (Added-PACAF) If the PIC believes a passenger does not fully understand the
  emergency procedures, the passenger will not be allowed to fly.
  A7.4.7. (Added-PACAF) Ensure orientation candidates receive appropriate Aircrew Flight
  Equipment, and abbreviated survival training, as specified in AFI 11-301 PACAF SUP 1, and
  PACAF/A3/5/8 Policy letter. Required life support training will be accomplished in certified
  training devices to the maximum extent possible. When a requirement for water survival
  training exists, ―wet‖ immersion training will be provided if at all possible.
  A7.4.8. (Added-PACAF) In fighter aircraft, for a flight above FL 180, orientation
  candidates must have current physiological training according to AFI 11-403, Aerospace
  Physiological Training Program, or their national equivalent. (Not applicable for passenger
  carrying, airlift, or air refueling aircraft.)
  A7.4.9. (Added-PACAF) Prior to orientation flight, brief all orientation candidates on
  appropriate procedures, or have them attend the appropriate training. Individuals with current
  rated experience must provide current documentation of USAF, Sister Service, DoD, or
  national equivalent training, or re-accomplish these requirements.
  A7.4.10. (Added-PACAF) List all orientation candidates on DD Form 2131, Passenger
  Manifest. Orientation candidates travel in passenger status, but will report through the
  command and control center to the aircraft commander. This will expose the individual to
  pre- and post-flight procedures, helping them understand these critical processes. Do not
  place non-aircrew members on the flight authorization. Exception: Approved MEPs (in
148                                  AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


  accordance with A8.3.3. of this guidance) and APT candidates. Include anti-hijacking
  protective measures according to AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting/Aircraft Piracy
  (Hijacking).
  A7.4.11. (Added-PACAF) The aircrew conducting the orientation flight must be highly
  qualified. At no time will an individual who is not qualified in the specific aircraft being
  flown occupy any pilot‘s seat (with a set of controls) with passengers on board. If the
  orientation candidate is a brigadier general (equivalent) or above, the aircraft commander
  must be an IP.
  A7.4.12. (Added-PACAF) In two-place aircraft, orientation candidates may occupy the
  right/rear seat as appropriate but will not be given control of an orientation aircraft unless the
  pilot has access to the controls and then only during non-critical phases of flight as defined in
  the applicable AFI 11-2MDS training publication. With an IP on board, rated general/flag
  officer pilots may fly the entire sortie in the front/left seat provided all of the following are
  accomplished: approved Senior Officer Course (if one exists), Bold Face/Critical Action
  Procedures (CAP) test (if applicable), appropriate normal/emergency landing procedures
  training in a simulator (if available).
  A7.4.13. (Added-PACAF) Critical Phases of Flight. In two place aircraft, no unqualified
  individual participating in an orientation flight will occupy a seat with controls.
      A7.4.13.1. (Added-PACAF) Non-Critical Phases of Flight. In two place aircraft,
      unqualified individuals participating in orientation flights may only occupy a seat with a
      set of controls once the aircraft is at altitude, and only with a highly experienced
      instructor pilot in the other seat. Refer to applicable AFI 11-2MDS training publication
      for exact definitions. IAW AFI 11-401, para 1.9.4.7.1.4.4, under no circumstances will a
      spouse be given control of the aircraft.
  A7.4.14. (Added-PACAF) The mission and briefing will not exceed the clearance level of
  the individual receiving the orientation flight. Ensure foreign disclosure requirements
  concerning visit authorizations and disclosure of USAF information are satisfied for foreign
  national orientation flights IAW AFI 16-201, Disclosure of Military Information to Foreign
  Governments and International Organizations. Contact HQ PACAF/FA3 at DSN 449-4149
  for any questions concerning foreign disclosure.
  A7.4.15. (Added-PACAF) Additional Operating Procedures – Civilians and Non-rated
  Individuals: The following additional restrictions apply to all civilians and non-rated
  individuals:
      A7.4.15.1. (Added-PACAF) Plan and execute mission profiles in a low risk
      environment with the exception of takeoff and landing. The enroute portion of the flight
      will not be flown below 1,000 feet above ground level (AGL) (500 ft AGL for C-130s).
      On Incentive flights, mechanically safe guns and download all film and external
      ordnance.
      A7.4.15.2. (Added-PACAF) Incentive flights in fighter aircraft will not involve air
      combat training ((D)BFM, (D)ACM, (D)ACT), or air to ground training (BSA/SAT)).
      Refer to the appropriate AFI 11-2MDS publication for specific definitions covering air
      combat or surface attack missions.
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                 149


      A7.4.15.3. (Added-PACAF) Conduct Incentive flights to avoid abrupt, unexpected
      maneuvers and high G-loading.
      A7.4.15.4. (Added-PACAF) Squadron Top Three must ensure pilots flying incentive
      flights receive adequate briefings to emphasize that the sortie objective is to reward
      and/or provide an incentive. Conduct missions so as not to overwhelm the observer and
      thus render the effort useless.
      A7.4.15.5. (Added-PACAF) Thoroughly brief all orientation candidates on all aspects
      of the flight to alleviate apprehension. Provide in-flight advisories to the orientation
      candidate to achieve the same objective.
      A7.4.15.6. (Added-PACAF) Civilian passengers aboard Air Force aircraft are
      prohibited from ―Flying‖ or manipulating the controls of the aircraft to include on-board
      systems such as air refueling booms.
      A7.4.15.7. (Added-PACAF) Following each flight, the SARM will return a copy of the
      completed checklist to their respective current operations section for accounting
      purposes. Current operations will maintain a log along with all completed flight
      checklist, AF Form 1042, AF Form 702 (if applicable), and AF Form 1522 (documenting
      egress training completed for passengers) for six months after flight completion.
   A7.4.16. (Added-PACAF) Spouse Orientation Flights will not be conducted in fighter,
   bomber, or two-seat trainer aircraft, however, Spouse Taxi Rides are authorized in fighter
   aircraft as an alternative. Limited to spouses of the following USAF military personnel:
   aircrew members, flight authorized crew chiefs, flight authorized mission-support personnel,
   and critical specialties in direct support of flying operations. The OG/CC determines
   personnel considered critical specialties and will not expand the program to an all-skills

  MISSION ESSENTIAL PERSONNEL (MEP) (PREVIOUSLY MISSION ESSENTIAL
      GROUND PERSONNEL (MEGP)/ADDITIONAL CREWMEMBER(ACM))

A8.1. (Added-PACAF) Definition. Mission Essential Personnel (MEP) are individuals who
are required for the execution of the aircraft or unit mission, to include follow-on missions. MEP
includes additional aircrew members and other personnel not authorized AOs who are tasked to
perform ground support duties at en route locations or destination points that are directly related
and essential to accomplishment of the aircraft or unit mission, e.g., a specialist or technician
required to provide aircraft support or a security team required to guard the aircraft. MEP may
include military staff personnel when required to accompany a senior officer and U.S.
Government employees when those individuals are required for the mission. Civilian contractors
will only be authorized MEP status if the Air Force is required to provide airlift as stipulated in
individual employment or company contracts. Foreign nationals (military or civilian) are not
authorized MEP status unless they are approved and participating in the military exchange
programs described in AFI 16-107, International Personnel Exchange Program and assigned to
USAF units.
A8.2. (PACAF) Responsibility. HQ PACAF/A3T is responsible for oversight of the MEP
program.
   A8.2.1. (Added-PACAF) MEP, to include additional crewmembers who fly in MEP status,
   are passengers and may only fly in aircraft capable of carrying passengers in accordance with
   the provisions of the basic instruction, and DoD 4515.13R, Air Transportation Eligibility,
   MEP status does not require physical or physiological training. They are not authorized to
   log time in the aircraft, nor are they entitled to flying incentive pay. MEP travel in passenger
   status, are manifested using a DD Form 2131, Passenger Manifest, but will report through
   the command and control center to the aircraft commander. Include anti-hijacking protective
   measures according to AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting/Aircraft Piracy (Hijacking).
   Limit the number of MEPs to the minimum necessary to complete the unit‘s mission. MEPs
   are authorized flight deck seating with aircraft commander approval. Do not use MEP status
   as a substitute for point-to-point travel requirements (see DoD 4515.13R, Air Transportation
   Eligibility, for Space-A duty passenger requirements). Commanders will ensure that MEP
   status is not used for travel at a higher priority than, or in lieu of regular passenger travel, for
   avoidance of travel expenses, or for travel while on leave. Do not bump MEPs en route
   without PACAF/AMOCC, PACAF/TACC, or Director Mobility Forces (DIRMOBFOR)
   approval. Do not use MEP status to provide blanket approval for recurring familiarization
   flights. Strictly control and approve MEP travel status for those with a bona fide mission
   essential purpose.
   A8.2.2. (Added-PACAF) Further guidance or restrictions concerning specific conditions of
   MEP presence on-board the aircraft will be the responsibility of individual AFI 11-2MDS
   series publications, as supplemented by the MAJCOM.
   A8.2.3. (Added-PACAF) Military members required to perform in-flight duties, frequently
   or occasionally, as defined by aircrew positions in paras 2.6. through 2.6.3. of the basic
   instruction will not be placed in MEP status.
A8.3. (Added-PACAF) Approval Authority.
 152                                 AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


   A8.3.1. (Added-PACAF) The OG/CC (or equivalent; approval level cannot be delegated
   below OG/CC) with operational control of the aircraft being flown approves MEP status on a
   case-by-case basis (each flight or mission). This includes any HQ PACAF or NAF Staff
   personnel or sister-service members. Blanket approval is not authorized. Forward a copy of
   all approval letters/memos to PACAF/A3T prior to flight. HQ PACAF/A3T approves
   civilian members of other U.S. federal agencies for MEP status on passenger capable aircraft
   when supporting PACAF missions (e.g., simulated survivors for CSAR exercises with en
   route ground-based duties).
A8.3.1.1. (Added) Air Mobility Division (AMD) Contractors are authorized to occasionally
fly on PACAF mobility aircraft to obtain familiarity with the flying environment as Mission
Essential Personnel (MEP). AMD Contractors will be designated as MEP on an approval
memorandum prior to each mission. PACAF/A3T is the approval authority. AMD Contractors
will present the approved memo to the unit flying the mission to have their names added to the
flight authorization. Flying time and training is not authorized to be logged or updated in
ARMS.
   A8.3.2. (Added-PACAF) Procedures. Submit requests for MEP status either via hard
   copy, or by electronic means to pacaf.a3t@hickam.af.mil. Requests requiring MAJCOM
   approval must be accompanied by a Staff Summary Sheet (SSS) in the Electronic Staff
   Package (ESP) format. Forward requests to the approving agency at least ten days prior to
   the expected date of flight(s). Include name, rank, organization, reason for travel, proposed
   itinerary, and dates. Ensure routing includes appropriate HQ PACAF agency staffing prior to
   arriving at PACAF/A3T. Failure to include appropriate staffing will result in a delay in
   processing and/or possible failure to approve request in a timely manner.
   A8.3.3. (Added-PACAF) Orders. Cite MEP approval in TDY travel orders, or approval
   authority letter. The following is an example statement: ―MEP status is authorized by
   (appropriate OG/CC, or PACAF/A3T) on (aircraft number or mission number, exercise or
   contingency name) for or between (duration, i.e., 22-27 June 2009).‖ End the statement with
   name and phone number of individual approving MEP status. MEP authority may also be
   cited in a letter or message using this statement. (Note: Approved MEPs may be placed on
   the Flight Authorization in the ―Remarks‖ section only for the purpose of maintaining
   billeting and transportation integrity with the aircrew only. They will not be annotated on the
   AFTO Form 781).
   A8.3.4. (Added-PACAF) Coordination of MEP travel. Individuals will coordinate their
   travel with the appropriate current operations function prior to travel. It is imperative that
   mission operators and air terminal operations centers are aware of MEP requirements when
   scheduling missions and crews. Individuals joining missions en route will present their travel
   orders to the appropriate PACAF command and control agency at least three hours prior to
   intended travel. Medical MEPs anticipating travel on aeromedical evacuation missions
   require prior approval from the AECC.
   A8.3.5. (Added-PACAF) Aircrew Procedures. With the concurrence of the aircraft
   commander and seats permitting, MEP may be seated on the flight deck/crew compartment
   during takeoff and landing, to include touch-and-go landings. Simulated emergencies, to
   include no-flap landings, with MEPs on-board are prohibited. Crews must be prepared to

  include MEPs on a DD Form 2131 and provide force protection measures (anti-hijacking)
  screening when passenger service is not available.

         8TH FIGHTER WING (8 FW) ORIENTATION FLIGHT GUIDELINES

A15.1. (8FW) General: DoD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation Eligibility and AFI 11-401,
Aviation Management regulate orientation Flights. These flights are an exceptional use of USAF
aircraft, flown only when benefits to the USAF are clearly established. This 8 FW Supplement
specifically provides incentive and familiarization flight guidance.
A15.2. (8FW) Definitions: An Orientation Flight is a continuous flight performed within the
local flying area (or other designated, approved location) terminating at the point of origin. An
orientation flight cannot be used for transporting an individual from one location to another. The
purpose is to reward, motivate, or increase an individual‘s understanding of the Air Force
mission. The Orientation Flight Program is a valuable tool for Kunsan AB and the Air Force,
and effectively managing the program requires strong leadership at all levels to ensure that the
appropriate benefits are derived from the program. Commanders must ensure each flight is
properly justified, to include benefits to the Air Force, and each sortie profile is designed to meet
the individual‘s needs or limitations to ensure a positive flight experience.
A15.3. (8FW) Types of Orientation Flights:
   A15.3.1. (8FW) Incentive Flight. Incentive Flights are dedicated missions for the
   passenger, generally as a reward for superior performance and continued motivation. These
   flights provide a visible reward to military personnel for outstanding service and motivate
   others to similar levels of performance. This category encompasses those flights allocated to
   the Wing and Group (or equivalent) Commanders to be utilized at their discretion. Flights
   will not be flown as part of any Continuation Training (CT) mission. Approval for an
   incentive ride is for a one-time flight only.
       A15.3.1.1. (8FW) Incentive Flight passengers will not have more than one incentive
       ride during their tour at Kunsan AB. NOTE: Familiarization flyers may receive an
       incentive flight as long as flight does not exceed 1 flight per calendar quarter and not
       above four authorized FAM sorties.
   A15.3.2. (8FW) Familiarization Flight. FAM flights are non-dedicated sorties that do not
   interfere with normal training. These flights familiarize individuals with USAF, PACAF and
   8 FW missions. Individuals receiving these flights have aviation-related responsibilities with
   USAF aircraft or missions or a requirement to observe routine training missions; thus the
   flight profile does not restrict mission training and may be conducted as part of CT missions.
   Individuals can be approved to perform these flights on a recurring (frequent) basis if
   justified by their commander and approved by the 8 FW/CC. FAM flights must have
   specific desired learning objectives spelled out for the FAM flyer, who has ―aviation-related
   responsibilities with USAF aircraft and missions.‖
       A15.3.2.1. (8FW) Members authorized for a FAM flight may not fly within 30 days of
       DEROS.
A15.4. (8FW) Roles and Responsibilities:
   A15.4.1. (8FW) 8 FW/CC will:
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                               163


     A15.4.1.1. (8FW) Annually review the base orientation flight program. Approve, as
     appropriate, any temporary or permanent changes to the quarterly quota distribution as
     listed in para A8.18.
  A15.4.2. (8FW) 8 OG/CC will:
     A15.4.2.1. (8FW) Provide guidance for the overall implementation of the Kunsan
     orientation flight program.
     A15.4.2.2. (8FW) Ensure Medical Group (8 MDG), Maintenance Group (8 MXG), and
     Mission Support Group (8 MSG) Commanders submit incentive flight nomination letters
     quarterly and ensure individuals selected for incentive flights are made available to
     complete all flight prerequisites and fly when scheduled. 8 OSS/OSOS will return
     request letters that exceed quota limit. (See para A8.18 for quotas).
        A15.4.2.2.1. (8FW) Incentive Flights are normally offered to 8 FW Yearly and
        Quarterly Award Winners. The 8 FW‘s four quarterly award winners (CGO, SNCO,
        NCO and Airman) and annual award winners are eligible to receive incentive flights
        as IAW para *A8.3.1 Additionally, 8 MSG/CC and 8 MXG/CC may nominate four
        additional people for Incentive Flights per quarter, and the 8 FW/CC, 8 OG/CC and 8
        MDG/CC may nominate two additional people per quarter. Additionally, the Patriot
        Battery commander can nominate one individual per half in using sample format (See
        Attachment 4).
        A15.4.2.2.2. (8FW) Other requests for Incentive Flights require an AF Form 1768,
        Staff Summary Sheet, routed through the GP/CC, 8 OG/CC to the 8 FW/CC for
        approval. After 8 FW/CC approval the package will be sent back to 8 OSS Wing
        Scheduling (8 OSS/OSOS) for scheduling and tracking purposes. It is incumbent
        upon the groups to submit their nominees in ample time to schedule their flight. As a
        general rule, this means an Incentive Flight nomination package should be completed
        at least two months prior to the individual‘s DEROS.
  A15.4.3. (8FW) 8 OSS/OSOS (Wing Scheduling) will:
     A15.4.3.1. (8FW) Provide oversight of the Orientation Flight Program, which includes
     the Incentive Flight Program, and the Familiarization Flight Program.
     A15.4.3.2. (8FW) Coordinate the update, review and approval of this Instruction.
     A15.4.3.3. (8FW) Administer the Orientation Flight Programs.
        A15.4.3.3.1. (8FW) Compile a list NLT 15st day of the quarter of personnel
        qualified for the Familiarization Flight Program from approved memorandums signed
        by the 8 OG/CC and 8 FW/CC.
        A15.4.3.3.2. (8FW) Provide a list of personnel to 8 FW/SEF (Aeromedical Safety)
        that will require a physiology training/waiver for altitude chamber training.
        A15.4.3.3.3. (8FW) 8 OSS/OSOS will monitor names submitted to ensure quotas
        are not exceeded.
        A15.4.3.3.4. (8FW) OSS/OSOS will prioritize and schedule the incentive flights.
        Scheduling priority is based on DEROS, followed by 8 FW Award Winners, the date
        of award, and finally by the date the request letter was approved by the 8 FW/CC.
 164                                 AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010


A15.5. (8FW) To conduct Incentive or FAM Flights while deployed off station, a list of
nominees must be approved by the 8 FW/CC through the 8 OG/CC prior to deployment. Blanket
approvals for deployments may be submitted and should be forwarded to the 8 OG/CC NLT two
weeks prior to the deployment date.
A15.6. (8FW) The process for Incentive Flights is:
   A15.6.1. (8FW) Group commanders send the names of their nominees to 8 OG/CC and 8
   FW/CC for approval no later than one month before the end of the quarter. If the individual
   is PCSing earlier, the nomination letter must reach the 8 OSS/OSOS at least two months
   prior to the anticipated DEROS.
       A15.6.2. (8FW) If an award winner declines their incentive flight, the slot reverts to the
       GP/CC and does not count against their quarterly quota.
A15.7. (8FW) For D-Model scheduling, incentive Flights take priority over FAM Flights.
Though every attempt will be made to accomplish all Incentive Flights, sorties are not
guaranteed due to aircraft availability, pilot training requirements, exercise requirements, or
other operational constraints. Incentive Flights will normally be scheduled on Fridays. FAM
Flights are flown on a non-interference basis, normally on days other than Fridays.
A15.8. (8FW) Supervisors will make every effort to allow award winners to receive their
flights when scheduled. Orientation Flights may not be able to be flown at a later date if
cancelled. If a flight must be cancelled, notify 8 OSS/OSOS as soon as possible.
A15.9. (8FW) Orientation flyers must familiarize themselves with this supplement and all pre-
flight requirements and coordinate his, or her, own schedule to be available for the flight.
A15.10. (8FW) Squadron SARMs will inform 8 OSS/OSOS of all completed FAM/Incentive
Flights by forwarding the completed Incentive/Orientation checklist to 8 OSS/OSOS NLT 48
hours after completion of the flight.
   A15.10.1. (8FW) 8 OSS/OSOS manages, coordinates, and tracks ALL Incentive and FAM
   Flights to meet the requirements of this supplement.
   A15.10.2. (8FW) 8 OSS/OSOS will maintain a master list containing all names of incentive
   and FAM flyers on the base network.
   A15.10.3. (8FW) Each 35 FS and 80 FS will schedule available D-model aircraft every
   non-PENCERE/CERE Friday. Two D-models from each squadron are desired for each turn
   on Fridays.
   A15.10.4. (8FW) Each 35 FS and 80 FS will inform 8 OSS/OSOS the week prior when
   they have open D-model aircraft that can be scheduled for incentive/FAM sorties.
   A15.10.5. (8FW) 8 OSS/OSOS will provide each participating individual a locally
   developed orientation sortie ground training schedule/checklist no later than 1200 noon on
   the Monday prior to their scheduled flight. They will also brief the individual on training
   requirements to ensure he/she will have adequate time to accomplish his/her training (See
   Attachment 9).
A15.11. (8FW) The individual incentive flyer is responsible for completion of the checklist and
accomplishment of all required training prior to flight. If the individual fails to accomplish
AFI11-401_PACAFSUP_8FWSUP_I 31 AUGUST 2010                                                  165


required ground training and submit the completed checklist to the SARM, he/she may be
removed from the Scheduled Flight list.
A15.12. (8FW) Prior to flight, the squadron Top 3 on duty will ensure the orientation sortie
ground training schedule/checklist has been completed and is on file with the SARM.
A15.13. (8FW) Pilots will use the crew coordination/passenger brief from the 8 FW In-Flight
Guide to thoroughly brief all passengers on normal and emergency procedures.
A15.14. (8FW) Aerospace Physiology, flight surgeons, aircrew flight equipment technicians,
and SERE trainers will conduct required briefings, examinations and training for passengers, and
document their completion on the orientation sortie ground training schedule/checklist.
A15.15. (8FW) Incentive Flight profiles should be tailored to the individual’s desires and
may include the following:
   A15.15.1. (8FW) Afterburner or military power takeoff.
   A15.15.2. (8FW) Max performance climb.
   A15.15.3. (8FW) Cruise to working area; formation work as desired.
   A15.15.4. (8FW) Supersonic run IAW applicable restrictions.
   A15.15.5. (8FW) Demonstration of aircraft handling and acrobatic performance.
   Maneuvers selected and flown are planned and tailored to meet the flight objectives. At no
   time will the comfort level or the ―G‖ tolerance of the back seat occupant be exceeded.
   A15.15.6. (8FW) Low level navigation (at or above 1, 000 feet AGL), level simulated
   weapons delivery, intercepts versus non-maneuvering target. Defensive reactions are limited
   to wing rocks only.
   A15.15.7. (8FW) Practice emergency procedures of any kind (e.g., simulated flame out
   patterns) are not permitted.
   A15.15.8. (8FW) Variations must be approved by 8 OG/CC.
A15.16. (8FW) FAM Flights:
   A15.16.1. (8FW) The intent of the FAM program is to educate FAM flyers through an
   ―Immersion Program‖ that results from meeting ―Desired Learning Objectives‖ (DLOs)
   tailored around the 8th FW combat mission.
   A15.16.2. (8FW) Squadron commanders will scrutinize each FAM sortie for achievable and
   valid DLOs. Squadron commanders will articulate on paper the DLOs for their nominated
   FAM flyers and include them in the submission package to the Group Commanders for
   approval.
   A15.16.3. (8FW) FAM Flights are non-interference sorties flown at the discretion of the 35
   FS and 80 FS Commanders.
   A15.16.4. (8FW) FAM Flights do not take precedence over Incentive Flights.
   A15.16.5. (8FW) FAM Flight recipients will complete the checklist in Attachment 3.
A15.17. (8FW) FAM Flights are primarily targeted for:
