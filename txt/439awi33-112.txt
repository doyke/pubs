This instruction implements AFPD 33-1, Information Resources Management, and AFI 33-104,
Base-Level Planning and Implementation. It provides direction for planning Communications
and Information (C&I) systems by establishing the Westover periodic formal planning forum,
called the C&I Planning Forum (CIPF), chaired by the installation commander. The CIPF meets
to discuss current and future issues affecting the C&I infrastructure and various systems it
supports and to formalize approval of the C&I Systems Blueprint. The forum’s purpose is to
coordinate planning of the C&I infrastructure with a proactive, centralized, base-wide focus.
This instruction applies to all organizations at Westover Air Reserve Base using C&I systems,
including new systems, changes to existing capabilities, or deletion of functions in a C&I system.
