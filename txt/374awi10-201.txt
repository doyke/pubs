SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This document
has minor formatting revisions (Attachment 1).
1. General Information. To be cognizant of assigned unit’s resources and training status,
designated individuals should review database retrievals provided by the 374th Airlift Wing
Reports/SORTS (374 AW/CP).
 2                                                                 374AWI10-201 3 MAY 2012


2. Responsibilities:
     2.1. The 374th Airlift Wing Commander (374 AW/CC) or appropriate authority will:
        2.1.1. Ensure at least two SORTS managers are appointed from 374 AW/CP to ensure
        continuity of reporting during peacetime and contingencies (i.e., deployments, leave,
        TDY, or permanent change of station [PCS]).
        2.1.2. Ensure the two appointed individuals are trained in the responsibilities of being a
        374 AW SORTS manager to provide continuity within the SORTS program. (Managers
        should have at least 12 months retainability.)
        2.1.3. Ensure that all newly assigned unit commanders receive SORTS indoctrination
        training upon inprocessing to the wing.
     2.2. 374 AW/CP will:
        2.2.1. Conduct wing-level initial training for new SORTS monitors and quarterly
        SORTS training for unit monitors to address the general responsibilities and procedures
        encompassing SORTS reporting, to include newly established reporting guidance. The
        374 AW/CP will also provide training to individual units and commanders upon request.
        The wing SORTS managers will keep all training documentation on file for initial (wing-
        level) and quarterly training for unit monitors.
        2.2.2. Ensure all new commanders receive training from the wing SORTS managers
        NLT 60 days from appointment. The wing SORTS managers will keep all commanders’
        training documentation on file.
        2.2.3. Maintain a classified SORTS continuity folder on each reporting unit containing
        the current master copy of the unit’s designed operational capability (DOC) statement,
        completed SORTS worksheets for 60 days, and GSORTS retrievals for 60 days.
        2.2.4. Maintain an unclassified continuity book (may be more than one) with information
        from each reporting unit to include: unit SORTS appointment letter, Manpower
        appointment letter, initial and quarterly unit monitor training, initial commander’s
        training, two most recent higher headquarters (HHQ) Staff Assistance Visits (SAVs) and
        results, two most recent Wing level SAVs and results, pertinent HHQ unit guidance
        messages, and 374 AW SORTS manager policy letters.
        2.2.5. Provide an annual schedule of monthly appointments for units to deliver their
        SORTS report. The scheduled show times will allow adequate time to address accuracy
        of the report as well as issues affecting the units reporting. The SORTS report will be
        processed while the unit monitor is in the command post. The GSORTS Database
        Retrieval will be provided to the unit monitor and the Wing SORTS managers will
        correct any errors found by the unit monitor within 24 hours.
            2.2.5.1. Maintain positive control of the most recent original worksheets for each unit
            reported in the wing’s SORTS database until such time as the material is properly
            destroyed.
        2.2.6. Brief the 374 AW/CC or designated alternate on the wing’s monthly SORTS
        reports and any out-of-cycle report(s) prior to transmission to HHQ. Ensure 374 AW/CC
        or designated alternate signs a releasing letter prior to transmission of any report.

     2.2.7. Transmit the wing’s SORTS report to HHQ by the last duty day of the month or
     within 24 hours of a change in readiness.
     2.2.8. Ensure all error notification messages are corrected within 24 hours after receipt.
     2.2.9. Conduct a SAV on each reporting unit semi-annually and as required. The last
     two SAV reports and any corrective action memos applicable to those SAV reports will
     be maintained on file in unit SORTS folders.
     2.2.10. Pull a database retrieval (DBR) for every report sent within 24 hours.
        2.2.10.1. Provide unit SORTS monitors with a copy of that unit’s DBR anytime an
        updated report is submitted. DBRs will be sent over SIPRnet to the unit monitor for
        verification, forwarded to the unit commander for review, and returned to the unit
        monitor and wing SORTS Manager. The DBR and email will be printed and posted.
        If for any reason this process cannot be completed due to technical difficulties, the
        unit commander will sign a hard copy which will be turned into the Wing SORTS
