   The Inspector General Complaints Resolution Program is prescribed by AFI 90-301, Inspector General
   Complaints Resolution. Air Force military and civilian members have a duty to promptly report fraud,
   waste, and abuse (FWA) or gross mismanagement; violations of law, policy, procedures, or regulations;
   an injustice; abuse of authority; misconduct; inappropriate conduct; and deficiencies, or like conditions,
   to the appropriate supervisor or commander, to an IG or other appropriate inspector, or through an
   established grievance channel.
   You have a right to file an IG complaint at any level, but experience has shown that many complaints
   can be resolved through the chain of command. For this reason, although not required to, you are
   encouraged to discuss your concerns with your chain of supervision and/or your commander before
   coming to the IG. If you wish to file an IG complaint, contact the Complaints Resolution Division:
