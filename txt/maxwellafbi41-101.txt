   1.3. No hospital or emergency room is available on Maxwell-Gunter AFB.

    Assistance by Montgomery Fire Department is requested through a local mutual aid
    agreement by 42 MSG/CEF personnel for response to Maxwell-Gunter AFB.

    1.5. In the event of multiple emergencies, delays in medical services may occur based on
    response priorities. Response to aircraft emergencies will have priority.

    1.6. The 42 MDG/CC or designated physician representative will review and approve
    standard emergency medical protocols to be used by 42 MSG/CEF personnel. The review of
    protocols will occur at least every two years. Protocols will be written to the Emergency
    Medical Technician-Basic (EMT-B) level.

2. Policy.

    2.1. The Air Force is responsible for paying ambulance service fees when active duty Air
    Force members require ambulance services due to an illness or injury.

    2.2. Billing for dependents of active duty members, retired personnel, or dependents of
    retired personnel may be cost shared by the patient under the TRICARE.

    2.3. Civilian employees pay for ambulance service, except when it is in response to an on-
    the-job injury or illness.

    2.4. The 42 MDG will determine and provide a limited budget for medical supplies and
    logistical support for 42 MSG/CEF to support the emergency medical response mission.

    2.5. The 42 MDG will assist 42 MSG/CEF in conducting required certification training and
    learning resources.

3. Responsibility.

    3.1. When contacted with a medical emergency, the 42 MSG/CEF Flight dispatcher will
    immediately dispatch a senior fire officer (SFO) and a rescue vehicle with at least two
    emergency medical technicians (Basic) to the scene. He or she will coordinate with Security
    Forces to escort off-base ambulance crews and/or Montgomery Fire Medics to the scene, if
    they are requested by the SFO. A contract ambulance service will provide emergency
    medical service on Maxwell AFB as administered by 42 MDG and 42 CONS.

    3.2. The 42 SFS dispatcher will dispatch a patrol to the scene of the medical emergency as
    needed or requested.

    42 MSG/CEF will respond to medical emergencies to provide basic life support until more
    advanced medical services arrive on scene.

   3.5. The SFO will request an additional off-base contract ambulance and/or Montgomery
   Fire Department medics when he/she determines the illness or injury requires advance
   medical assistance.

   3.6. 42 MSG/CEF dispatchers will notify the base command post (and medical control
   center, if open) when a person is transported via ambulance. The dispatcher will also relay to
   the hospital where the patient was transported.

   3.7. Follow-up on patient status will be solely coordinated by 42 MDG.

   3.8. Based on the situation, the SFO may request activation and deployment of 42 MDG
   mass casualty teams in accordance with Incident Command System procedures and policies.

   3.9. Hazardous medical waste will be placed in red Bio Hazard bags or sharps containers and
   brought to the base clinic for disposal in approved areas. Transportation will be made in a
   government owned vehicle (GOV) and materials secured and marked appropriately. Civilian
   ambulances will dispose of medical waste through their own channels.

   3.10. 42 MSG/CEF personnel will use the Maxwell AFB Form 2, Fire Department
   Emergency Medical Report. The Maxwell AFB Form 2 documents patient information
   relevant to emergency calls for assistance. The data is filled in as applicable/other areas
   filled in are self-explanatory. It is stocked and used by 42 MSG/CEF.

Emergency Services Flight, the SFO will ensure the crew leader completes MAFB Form 13,
Event Summary Sheet (prescribed by MAFBI 41-102, Public Access Defibrillation Program).
The SFO will immediately take control of the AED, remove it from service, clean, and download
it. The SFO will ensure two copies of the report are printed and saved on two separate electronic
copies to removable data storage devices. Data will be immediately provided to the 42 MDG/CC

ensuring the AED unit is immediately returned to service.
