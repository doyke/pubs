This instruction implements AFPD 21-1, Air and Space Maintenance. It establishes procedures for the
identification, documentation and transportation of PME for calibration purposes to the required precision
measurement equipment laboratory (PMEL). It applies to all organizations possessing PME assigned or
attached to Westover ARB.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision changes the location of the base PME coordinator and establishes a time frame for transport-
ing PME to the laboratory (paragraph 2.2.). A bar ( | ) indicates a revision from the previous edition.


1. Responsibilities. Owning work centers will be familiar with the following technical references: T.O.
00-20-14, Air Force Metrology and Calibration Program, and T. O. 33K-1-100-1, TMDE Calibration
Notes.

2. Owning Organizations.
   2.1. Work centers will identify and add all PME to their respective owning center equipment listing
   and maintain a current status.
   2.2. Work centers will deliver PME to the base PME coordinator during duty hours in building 2426,
   room 9, two days prior to transporting to PME laboratory.
   2.3. Work centers will provide the necessary documents required to process the PME equipment in a
   timely manner. A copy of hand receipts for PME items at the laboratory will be kept on file.

    2.5. Work centers will notify PMEL prior to purchase of items not listed in T. O. 33K-1-100-1 to
    determine test measurement diagnostic equipment support for initial calibration. Contact base coordi-
    nator for PMEL laboratory numbers.
