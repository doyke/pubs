2. AAFES/DECA Responsibilities.
    2.1. Upon detention of an individual suspected of shoplifting (hereinafter referred to as
    ―subject‖), determine the amount of actual damages sustained by the shoplifting incident.
    The ―actual damages sustained‖ means the retail price of the item the subject stole or
    attempted to steal if the item is unfit or unavailable for sale subsequent to the theft. If the
    item is recovered and available for resale, there are no actual damages.
    2.2. When a shoplifting occurs, complete and hand deliver or mail via certified mail to the
    subject or sponsor:
       2.2.1. A first payment demand letter (Attachment 2), which clearly states the claimed
       amount. If merchandise is recovered and is available for sale, the amount claimed will
       be: the difference between the full retail value and the reduced sale value, plus an
       administrative charge of $200.00. If the merchandise is lost or otherwise cannot be sold,
       the amount claimed will be the full retail value of the merchandise, plus an administrative
       charge of $200.00. This demand letter must also include a statement that if the debt is
       not paid in full by a date certain (determined to be 30 days after the date the first demand
       letter was hand delivered or sent via certified mail), the AAFES store manager will be
       required to notify the unit commander of the debt. In addition, the demand letter must
       state that the military sponsor’s check cashing and any Military Star card privileges will
       be suspended until the debt is either paid or waived.
       2.2.2. A second demand letter will be sent if the first demand letter does not result in full
       payment of the debt within 14 days after the first demand letter was sent by hand delivery
       or via certified mail. The second demand letter must contain the same information
       provided in paragraph 2.2 above.
       2.2.3. A completed payment receipt (Attachment 3) demanding payment for the
       damages within 20 days, must accompany each demand letter.
       2.2.4. The acknowledgment of receipt of apprehension letter (Attachment 4).
    2.3. Inform Security Forces of any known aggravating circumstances and the subject’s
    history of prior shoplifting detentions at the Base Exchange/Commissary if known.
    2.4. Inform 87 ABW/JA whether subject has or has not made payment in satisfaction of the
    demand letter.

     3.1.2. If the subject is a minor, attempt to locate sponsor or guardian in the store area. If
     attempts fail, contact the sponsor’s residence and request he/she respond to the incident
     location. Juvenile names will not be transmitted over the radio.
     3.1.3. Review the closed circuit television videotapes, if any, to ensure the subject
     detained is the same individual observed on the tapes. Seize videotape via AF Form 52,
     Evidence Tag. Ensure the tab is removed from video to prevent erasure. If an
     AAFES/DECA employee directly observed the shoplifting, ask the employee to identify
     the subject and describe the events leading to the detention.
     3.1.4. If there is a reasonable basis for believing the subject stole AAFES/DECA
     property: For active duty military - apprehend and transport the subject to the law
     enforcement desk and notify subject’s first sergeant or unit commander; for civilians –
     process paperwork and give citation on scene, and then release the individual.
     3.1.5. Inform the subject of his or her rights under Article 31 of the Uniform Code of
     Military Justice (active duty military) or under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S.
     Constitution (all others) using AF Form 1168. If the subject is a minor, advisement of
     rights should take place in the presence of the sponsor, parents, or a witness prior to
     asking any questions.
     3.1.6. Describe evidence fully on AF Form 52 and AF Form 3545, Incident Report.
     Security Forces will retain stolen article(s).

     3.1.8. Security Forces Reports and Analysis Section will coordinate with 87 MSG/CC on
     all AAFES/Commissary privilege suspensions.
     3.1.9. Hand adult subjects written notice of preliminary suspension of
     AAFES/Commissary privileges, if approved by the 87 MSG/CC. If the subject is a
     minor, deliver the written notice to the minor’s sponsor or parent.
     3.1.10. Security Forces will seize subject’s DD Form 1173, Uniformed Services
     Identification and Privilege Card, (for all dependents) via AF Form 52, ―No
     AAFES/DECA Privileges‖ will be typed/stamped on the AF Form 52 so the individual(s)
     can’t use the AF Form 52 to enter other AAFES facilities. Ensure the subject receives a
     copy of the AF Form 52 since it will serve as a temporary ID card until a new card is
     issued at Military Personnel Flight. ID cards of active duty, reservists, and retired
     personnel will not be seized.
     3.1.11. Complete an AF Form 3545 for every case.
     3.1.12. Release the subject upon completion of processing. Active duty military
     personnel should be released to their first sergeants or commanders. All others, with the
     exception of minors, will be released on their own recognizance. Minors should be
     released to a custodial parent or guardian, if one can be found.
  3.2. Within seven days of the incident, deliver to 87 ABW/JA a copy of any description of
  aggravating circumstances, any criminal record, the incident report, and the preliminary
  suspension letter.

       4.1.1. Review the evidence and determine if the preponderance of the evidence supports
       the suspension of AAFES/DECA privileges. If suspension is not justified, withdraw the
       preliminary suspension.
       4.1.2. In all other cases, keep the suspension of AAFES/DECA privileges in place.
       4.1.3. If the subject has committed another shoplifting offense within the past 5 years,
