This instruction implements Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as
amended, Title 40, United States Code, Section 471, et.seq., Air Force Policy Directive 23-1,
Materiel Management,and AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual,Volume 6, Chapter 4,
Precious Metals Recovery Program (PMRP), and provides basic policy for managing the
recovery of precious metals. Procedures are provided to ensure the proper control, identification,
and accounting of items containing precious metals. The PMRP is established to promote the
economic recovery of precious metals from excess and scrap materials. Within the Air Force
inventory, a number of commodities contain precious metals which are not consumed in their
use. Retention of this residue is of vital importance to the USAF, in that dollar savings can be
realized and affects the better utilization of metals which are limited within our country’s natural
resources. The PMRP applies to all USAF activities, and on Aviano AB, to all organizations and
geographically separated units, which generate, store or dispose of precious metals bearing scrap
or residue. Refer any questions, concerns, or recommended changes regarding this publication to
the 31 LRS/Compliance & Analysis Office, 31lrs.compaccount@aviano.af.mil. Ensure that all
records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of
in accordance with the Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Air
Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-

        assume responsibility for managing the installation PMRP, and appoint in writing an
        installation PMRPM in the grade of E-5 or higher, or a civilian of equal grade/rank. The
        appointment letter must be signed by the 31 FW/CC, IAW AFMAN 23-110, Vol 6, Ch
        4, Precious Metals Recovery Program, Para 4.2.1 The PRMPM will act as the single
        point for all matters concerning the PMRP. Duties of the PRMPM will include at a
        minimum the following responsibilities:
            1.1.1.1. Review supply account records quarterly to identify stock numbers assigned
            a Controlled Identification Code (CIC) “R” (fine precious metals or high precious
            metals content). Item record review will be accomplished with a Discoverer script.
            All items with a CIC “R” will be assigned an Issue Exception Code (IEX) “S” to
            restrict automatic issue of these assets. Ensure all activities receiving, issuing and
            using items assigned IEX “S” appoint an individual (s) in writing to receipt for these
            materials. The appointment letter must be signed by the section NCOIC or higher.
            1.1.1.2. The PMRPM will schedule and perform annual visits of all organizations
            involved in the PMRP, in conjunction with the supply procedural surveillances
            performed by the Maintenance Support Liaison (31 LRS/LGRMMM, email: 31
            LRS/MSL@aviano.af.mil) at maintenance work centers. Review of the Electrolytic
            Recovery Program, if any, the organization’s self-inspection program, and issue/turn-
            in procedures per Attachment 3 below, are minimum requirements.
            1.1.1.3. Provide guidance to organization PMRP monitors on local Defense Reutilization
            and Marketing Office(s) (DRMO), (https://www.drms.dla.mil/drmo/aviano.shtml, DSN
            632-5082), procedures for the turn-in of precious metals scrap.
     1.2. On-Base Activities:
        1.2.1. Assign an individual in writing as the Unit PMRP monitor. The appointment letter
        will be signed by the individual’s unit commander or delegated member, and must
        include name, rank, office symbol, duty phone, type of recovery equipment (if any), kind
        of precious metals scrap generated and the kinds of fine precious metals items used (if
        any). Forward a copy of this letter to the installation PRMPM in Inspection.
        1.2.2. If fine precious metals (i.e. pure gold) are used within the unit, submit a letter
        signed by the Unit Commander to the installation PRMPM, listing individuals authorized
        to receipt for fine precious metals.
        1.2.3. Develop unit PMRP instructions to facilitate the recovery of all precious metal
        bearing material (i.e. bench stock one-for-one trade).
AVIANOABI23-107 23 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                3


     1.2.4. Unit PMRP Monitors:
         1.2.4.1. Maintain a PMRP binder to include a current copy of this instruction,
         AFMAN 23-110, Volume 6, Chapter 4, unit PMRP monitor appointment letter, unit
         PMRP instructions, letter authorizing receipt for fine precious metals (if required), list
         of precious metal codes, accountability log, inventory of recovery equipment (if
         required), copies of signed DD Form 1348-1A, Issue Release/Receipt Document,
         turn-ins, and copies of the PMRP self-inspections for a minimum of one year.
         1.2.4.2. Conduct a semiannual self-inspection of the unit PMRP in May and
         November. The self-inspection will be accomplished to coincide with the base self-
         inspection program. Maintain one copy of the self-inspection report in unit’s PMRP
         binder and forward one copy to the base PRMPM. Use Attachment 3 for checklist
         format.
         1.2.4.3. Conduct in-house training for personnel involved in both the use and
         recovery of precious metals bearing material. Focus training on understanding and
         applying proper procedures to protect and recover precious metals bearing material.
         1.2.4.4. Maintain a secured/centralized precious metals holding bin/area. Ensure this
         area is visibly identified as “Precious Metal Bearing Material Holding Area”; it will
         be used to store material containing precious metals until a sufficient amount is
         collected for turn-in. When a sufficient amount of precious metal bearing scrap is
         collected, the unit PMRP monitor will process an off-line transfer to DRMO. Off-line
         document numbers must be obtained from Inspection. IAW AFMAN 23-110, Vol 1,
         Part 1, Chap 3, Para 3.55.2.3, customers will coordinate with Documented Cargo,
         31 LRS/LGRDDO, DSN 632-5509, for delivery of assets to Inspection. In addition, at
         the option of the PRMPM, unserviceable assets may be picked up during semiannual
         inspections. Once the items have been turned-in, forward a signed copy of the turn-in
         document to the base PRMPM in Inspection. The off-line transfer DD Form 1348-1A
         document will be formatted per Attachment 2.            NOTE: Only items with a
         Demilitarization code of “A” can be turned in locally. For all other Demilitarization
         codes, see Attachment 2.
  1.3. Photographic Processing Activities:
     1.3.1. Comply with all generating activity guidelines as stated above.
     1.3.2. Keep sufficient containers on-hand for storage of spent (waste) hypo solution.
     1.3.3. Hypo storage tanks containing precious metal bearing solution, will be stored in a
     secured area.
  1.4. Off-Base Activities:
     1.4.1. Off-base activities will participate in this program to the maximum extent
     possible, and comply with the same responsibilities assigned to on-base activities
     described above. Limited or non-participation must be approved in writing by the 31
     Mission Support Group Commander.
     1.4.2. Geographically Separated Units (GSU) will utilize local DRMO at each site for
     turn-in of precious metal scrap.

        1.4.3. Screen all agencies at the GSU for possible reutilization of serviceable precious
        metal bearing material prior to processing a shipment using DD Form 1149, Requisition
        and Invoice/Shipping Document, to 31 LRS/Inspection Section. Every effort should be
        made to utilize excess consumable material at GSUs. If a user is found, the material will
        be provided to the user at no charge.
        1.4.4. If a user of excess precious metal bearing material cannot be located at the GSU,
        ship the material as volume dictates, using a DD Form 1149, on a space available basis to
        the following address:
31 LRS/LGRMCI
ATTN: PMRP Manager
Unit 6108, Box 230
APO AE 09604-8230


2. Procedures:
     2.1. Activities/organizations must maintain a neat and organized precious metal scrap
     holding area.
     2.2. All material awaiting off-line transfer to DRMO must be clean and free of excess dirt
     and oil.
     2.3. As the volume of precious metals scrap dictates, the using activity will segregate scrap
     in accordance with the DRMO handbook and prepare off-line transfers to DRMO.
     Generating activities will prepare DD Form 1348-1A, for all material being transferred to
     DRMO IAW Attachment 2.
     2.4. Material being transferred off-line to DRMO, including batch lots of scrap(s), will be
     tagged with a condemned/red tag, DD Form 1577-1, Unserviceable (Condemned) Label –
     Materiel, materials.
