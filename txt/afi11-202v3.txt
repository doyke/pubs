   1.1.1. Pilot in Command Authority. The Pilot in Command (PIC), regardless of rank, is
   responsible for, and is the final authority for the operation of the aircraft.
   1.1.2. This AFI provides broad guidance and cannot address every situation. Aircrew will
   use best judgment to safely conduct flying operations.
   1.1.3. Supplemental information to this AFI may be found in the AFMAN 11-217 series.
   1.1.4. This instruction is a common source of flight directives that includes:
       1.1.4.1. Air Force guidance;
       1.1.4.2. Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFRs) and the Aeronautical Information
       Manual (AIM); and,
       1.1.4.3. International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Standards and Recommended
       Practices (SARPs).
   1.1.5. Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) or Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) applicability.
       1.1.5.1. Categories 4 and 5 RPA operations shall follow this AFI; Categories 1-3
       (“Small”) UAS shall be governed by AFI 11-502V3, Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems
       Operations. UAS/RPA categories are listed in AFI 11-502V3.
1.2. Waivers. Directive guidance (will, shall, must, etc.) throughout this regulation are tiered
IAW AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management. For examples of tiered waivers, see
AFI 33-360. HAF/A3O designates the HQ AFSSA/CC as the Approving Official to concur with
renewal of existing waivers. MAJCOM/A3 is waiver authority for MAJCOM supplements to this
instruction and in the appropriate MDS-specific Volume 3.
   1.2.1. Waiver Process. Coordination through HQ AFFSA/XOF (hqaffsa.xof@us.af.mil) is
   required for the initiation of Tier 0 and 1 waivers and is recommended prior to initiation of
   Tier 2 and 3 waivers. HQ AFFSA/XOF will provide only written waivers; verbal waivers are
   not authorized.
       1.2.1.1. Tier 0: Annotated by “(T-0)”. Determined by respective non-AF authority (e.g.
       Congress, White House, Secretary of Defense, Joint Staff, etc.). The waiver authority is
       external to AF.
           1.2.1.1.1. HQ AFFSA/XOF will be contacted to initiate Tier 0 waivers. Following a
           MAJCOM/CC (delegable no lower than MAJCOM/A3) request, HQ AFFSA/XOF
           will request AFI Certifying Official approval for a Tier 0 waiver after concurrence
           from the external agency (i.e. an Exemption to the CFRs granted by the Federal
           Aviation Administration (FAA) Administrator). Tier 0 waiver renewal requests will
           only be accepted from MAJCOM Stan/Eval.
           1.2.1.1.2. Tier 0 guidance may include FAA guidance from the Codified Federal
           Regulations (CFRs) or ICAO guidance from the SARPs.

        1.2.1.2. Tier 1: Annotated by “(T-1)”. Non-compliance puts Airmen, commanders or
        the USAF strongly at risk of mission or program failure, death, injury, legal jeopardy or
        unacceptable fraud, waste or abuse.
            1.2.1.2.1. HQ AFFSA/XOF will initiate Tier 1 waivers. Following a MAJCOM/CC
            (delegable no lower than MAJCOM/A3) request, HQ AFFSA/XOF will request AFI
            Certifying Official concurrence. Tier 1 waiver renewal requests will only be accepted
            from MAJCOM Stan/Eval.
            1.2.1.2.2. Tier 1 includes guidance that lends to standardization across all USAF
            wings and platforms.
        1.2.1.3. Tier 2: Annotated by “(T-2)”. Non-compliance may degrade mission or
        program effectiveness or efficiency and has potential to create moderate risk of mission
        or program failure, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable fraud, waste, or abuse.
            1.2.1.3.1. MAJCOM Stan/Eval will initiate Tier 2 waivers and will request
            MAJCOM/CC (delegable no lower than MAJCOM/A3) approval for all Tier 2
            waivers. Tier 2 waivers only apply within the approving MAJCOM.
            1.2.1.3.2. Tier 2 guidance includes instruction that lends to standardization across
            MAJCOM-specific wings and platforms. Once approved, MAJCOM Stan/Eval will
            send an informational copy to HQ AFFSA/XOF within 5 duty days.
        1.2.1.4. Tier 3: Annotated by “(T-3)”. Non-compliance may limit mission or program
        effectiveness or efficiency and has a relatively remote potential to create risk of mission
        or program failure, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable fraud, waste, or abuse.
            1.2.1.4.1. Wing commanders, delegable no lower than operations group commanders
            or equivalent, will initiate and approve Tier 3 waiver requests. Once approved, wings
            will send an informational copy to MAJCOM Stan/Eval and HQ AFFSA/XOF within
            5 duty days.
            1.2.1.4.2. Tier 3 guidance includes instruction that is limited to wing- and location-
            specified rules that do not affect AF-level standardization.
     1.2.2. For the purposes of this instruction, flying MAJCOMS are: ACC, AETC, AFDW,
     AFGSC, AFMC, AFRC, AFSOC, AMC, DIA, NGB, PACAF, and USAFE. Commander Air
     Force forces (COMAFFORs) in the grade of O-8 or higher in Combatant Commands
     (CCMDs) are considered MAJCOM commanders only for forces under their operational
     control.
1.3. Compliance. The PIC will ensure compliance with this AFI and the following (see
Attachment 1 for related publications):
     1.3.1. Air Force, Major Command (MAJCOM), and Mission Design Series (MDS)-specific
     instructions;

comply with the reporting requirements in paragraph 1.6. (T-0). MAJCOMs may authorize
tactical operations for training and compliance with paragraph 1.2.5.
1.5. MAJCOM Supplements. MAJCOM supplements shall not be less restrictive than this
instruction and be IAW AFI 33-360. Submit supplements to HQ AFFSA/XOF
(hqaffsa.xof@us.af.mil) for coordination prior to publishing.
   1.5.1. Tier 0 and 1 waivers shall not be published in MAJCOM supplemental guidance.
1.6. Deviations. An ATC clearance is not authority to deviate from this instruction. A PIC may
only deviate from this instruction, flight rule, or ATC clearance to protect life, for safety of
flight, or when an in-flight emergency requires immediate action.
   1.6.1. Notification. When deviating from an ATC clearance, notify ATC of the action taken
   as soon as possible.
   1.6.2. Post-Flight Actions. In the event of a deviation from a flight rule and/or when given
   traffic priority by ATC in an emergency, the PIC will verbally report the incident to a
   supervisor and commander within 24 hours of the incident and shall make a detailed written
   record (T-0). The unit will keep a copy of the record for a minimum of 1 year from the date
   of the incident and be prepared to provide the record to the appropriate investigating
   authority if required (T-0).
1.7. Violations. A violation may result when a USAF aircraft deviates from flight rules. FAA
ATC deviation reports involving a USAF aircraft are processed by the Air Force Representative
to the FAA (AFREP) IAW AFI 13-201, Airspace Management. Air Force ATC deviation reports
involving USAF aircraft are processed IAW AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention
Program. Violations that occur in the airspace of foreign nations are processed IAW the
procedures of that nation.
   1.7.1. For any alleged violation, utilize aircraft call-sign for any contact with ATC. Do not
   release names of crewmembers to non-USAF agencies without the permission of the AFREP
   in coordination with the MAJCOM/A3 or HQ USAF/A3O.
   1.7.2. If notified by an AFREP of a possible violation, MAJCOMs will preserve any

                                           Chapter 2

                                    FLIGHT READINESS

2.1. Crew Rest. Crew rest is compulsory for aircrew members prior to performing any duties
involving aircraft operations and is a minimum of 12 non-duty hours before the Flight Duty
Period (FDP) begins (T-2). Crew rest is free time and includes time for meals, transportation, and
rest. This time must include an opportunity for at least 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep. Crew rest
period cannot begin until after the completion of official duties.
   2.1.1. Aircrew members are individually responsible to ensure they obtain sufficient rest
   during a crew rest period.
   2.1.2. Any official business interrupts the crew rest period. If crew rest is interrupted,
   individuals will immediately inform appropriate leadership or command and control (C2) and
   will either begin a new crew rest period or not perform flight duties (T-1). Exception:
   Aircrew may initiate mission-related communication with official agencies without
   interrupting crew rest.
   2.1.3. Exceptions to the 12-Hour Minimum Crew Rest Periods. For continuous operations
   when basic aircrew FDPs are between 12 to 14 hours, subsequent crew rest may be reduced
   to a minimum of 10 hours by the PIC in order to maintain a 24-hour work/rest schedule (T-
   2). “Continuous operations” is defined as three or more consecutive FDPs of at least 12 hours
   duration with minimum crew rest period.
       2.1.3.1. The 10-hour crew rest exception shall only be used to keep crews in 24-hour
       clock cycles, not for scheduling convenience or additional sortie generation.
       2.1.3.2. Any reduction from 12-hour crew rest requires pre-coordination for
       transportation, meals, and quarters so that crewmembers are provided an opportunity for
       at least 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep.
2.2. Flight Duty Period (FDP) (see Table 2 1). FDP may be waived by MAJCOM/A3 when
an ORM assessment determines that mission requirements justify the increased risk. At
MAJCOM/A3 discretion, waiver authority may be further delegated to no lower than the
operations group commander (or equivalent). Waivers to flight duty limitations may be
published in MAJCOM guidance or on a case-by-case basis.
   2.2.1. FDP begins when an aircrew member reports for a mission, briefing, or other official
   duty and ends at final engine shutdown after the final flight of the completed mission. FDP
   for UAS aircrew member ends at final engine shutdown, final in-flight handover briefing, or
   final crew swap, whichever occurs last.
   2.2.2. When authorized by the waiver authority, the PIC may extend FDP a maximum of 2
   hours to compensate for mission delays.
2.3. Post-Flight Duties. If official post-flight duties are anticipated to exceed 2 hours,
commanders should consider reducing the FDP to ensure the safe completion of those duties.

 NOTE 1: Sleeping provisions are crew bunks or other MAJCOM-defined rest facilities aboard the aircraft.
 Rest facilities should provide adequate privacy and noise levels to obtain suitable rest.


2.4. Deadhead Time. Deadhead time is when an aircrew member flies as a passenger (no
flight-related duties performed) while on flight orders and may be flown without crew rest.
    2.4.1. If flight-related duties are planned to be performed in conjunction with deadheading,
    crew rest and FDP restrictions apply (T-2).
    2.4.2. Deadhead time will not occur within 12 hours after accomplishing aircrew-related
    duties unless requested by the aircrew member and coordinated by C2 (T-3).
    2.4.3. Deadhead crewmembers will be annotated as Mission Essential Personnel (MEP) on
    the Flight Authorization IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management.
2.5. Alert Duty. MAJCOMs establish alert and compensatory periods in keeping with mission
requirements and risk management (RM).
2.6. Maximum Flying Time. 56 flight hours per 7 consecutive days, 125 flight hours per 30
consecutive days, and 330 flight hours per 90 consecutive days (T-1).

     paragraph 2.1. (T-2).
     2.7.1.2. If any alcohol is consumed within 12 hours prior to takeoff (or assuming aircraft
     control for UAS) or if impaired by alcohol or any other intoxicating substance, to include
     the effects or after-effects.
     2.7.1.3. Anytime a physical or psychological condition is suspected or known to be
     detrimental to the safe performance of flight duty. Consult a flight surgeon at the earliest
     opportunity.
     2.7.1.4. While self-medicating, except IAW the “Official Air Force Aerospace Medicine
     Approved Medications” found in AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards.
     2.7.1.5. Within 24 hours of compressed gas diving including SCUBA, surface supplied
     diving, hyperbaric (compression) chamber exposure or aircraft pressurization checks (to
     below sea level) that exceed 10 minutes duration (this restriction not applicable to UAS
     flight operations) (T-1). Exceptions: Following Helicopter Emergency Egress Device
     System (HEEDS) training, aircrew may only fly within the 24-hour window if the
     aircraft’s maximum altitude remains below 10,000 ft. MSL. Air Force divers on
     aeronautical orders will follow guidelines IAW SS521-AG-PRO-010 U.S. Navy Diving
     Manual for flying and diving restrictions (T-1).
     2.7.1.6. Within 12 hours after completion of a hypobaric (altitude) chamber flight above
     25,000 ft. mean sea level (MSL) (T-1). Personnel may fly as passengers in aircraft during
     this period provided the planned mission will maintain a cabin altitude of 10,000 ft. MSL
     or less. For altitude chamber flights to a maximum altitude of 25,000 ft. MSL or below,
     aircrew members may fly without restriction as crewmembers or passengers if cabin
     altitude is not planned to exceed 15,000 ft. MSL (this restriction not applicable to UAS
     flight operations). There are no restrictions following Reduced Oxygen Breathing Device
     (ROBD) training.
     2.7.1.7. Within 72 hours after donating blood, plasma, or bone marrow (T-1).
  2.7.2. Medical. Aircrew members must maintain a medical clearance from the flight
  surgeon to perform in-flight duties (T-1). Medical or dental treatment obtained from any
  source must be cleared by a flight surgeon prior to reporting for flight duty (T-1).
     2.7.2.1. Use of any medication or dietary supplements is governed by AFI 48-123 and as
     approved by a flight surgeon. Aircrew members will not normally self-medicate. In the
     absence of other MAJCOM guidance, the following is a partial list of medications that
     may be used without medical consultation:
         2.7.2.1.1. Single doses of over-the-counter (OTC) aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen
         to provide analgesia for minor self-limiting conditions.
         2.7.2.1.2. OTC skin antiseptics, topical anti-fungals, 1% hydrocortisone cream, or
         benzoyl peroxide for minor wounds and skin diseases which do not hinder flying
         duties or wear of personal equipment.
         2.7.2.1.3. OTC antacids for mild isolated episodes of indigestion.
         2.7.2.1.4. OTC hemorrhoidal suppositories.
AFI11-202V3 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                    15


          2.7.2.1.5. OTC bismuth subsalicylate for mild cases of diarrhea.
          2.7.2.1.6. OTC oxymetazoline or phenylephrine nasal sprays may be carried should
          unexpected ear or sinus block occur during flight. Aircrew may only use such sprays
          as “get me downs.” Do not use to treat symptoms of head congestion prior to flight.
2.8. Alertness Management and Fatigue Mitigation. MAJCOMs will provide guidance to
address aircrew alertness and fatigue management.
   2.8.1. Fatigue Countermeasure Medications. MAJCOMs will provide guidance on the
   use of go and no-go medications IAW AF/SG policy.
   2.8.2. Controlled Cockpit Rest. Controlled cockpit rest may be implemented when the
   basic aircrew includes a second qualified pilot. All cockpit crewmembers must remain at
   their stations (T-0). Cockpit rest shall be limited to 45 minutes, taken by only one
   crewmember at a time, and must be restricted to non-critical phases of flight between cruise
   and one hour prior to planned descent (T-2). More than one rest period per crewmember is
   permitted. Cockpit rest is not authorized when aircraft system malfunctions increase cockpit
   workload (e.g., autopilot, navigation systems) (T-1). The resting crewmember must be
   awakened immediately if a situation develops that affects flight safety. Cockpit rest shall not
   be a substitute for any required crew rest (T-1).
   2.8.3. Flight publications describe procedures for loss of pressurization, oxygen, cockpit
   temperature control, inoperative autopilot, and other in-flight malfunctions or emergencies
   that restrict flight duration and contribute to aircrew fatigue. Such limitations in-flight
   publications take precedence over less restrictive standards in this instruction.
2.9. Aircrew Flight and Survival Equipment. Wear and use authorized clothing and
equipment IAW AFI 11-301, Volume 1, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Program, AFI 16-
1301, Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) Program, MAJCOM guidance, Special
Instructions (SPINS), and the aircraft technical order (T.O.) (T-1).
   2.9.1. Spectacles. Crewmembers that require corrective spectacles while performing
   aircrew duties must only use Air Force-provided spectacles (T-1). Crewmembers must also
   carry a spare set of clear Air Force-provided spectacles while performing aircrew duties (T-
   1).
   2.9.2. Sunglasses. MAJCOMs will determine the types of sunglasses approved for flight.
   2.9.3. Contact Lenses. Crewmembers who desire contact lenses must consult a flight
   surgeon, meet criteria, and follow guidelines outlined in AFI 48-123. While performing
   aircrew duty, comply with paragraph 2.9.1. (T-1).
   2.9.4. Laser Eye Protection. MAJCOMs that permit aircrew laser eye protection will
   publish specific guidance on training and use prior to in-flight use. Aircrew will follow AFI
   11-301, Volume 4, Aircrew Laser Eye Protection (ALEP), when potential laser hazards
   exists.
   2.9.5. Night Vision Devices (NVDs). Crewmembers must undergo a MAJCOM-approved
   initial certification course IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 1, Aircrew Training, prior to their
   initial flight with NVDs (T-1). If wearing clear spectacles, contact lenses, or laser eye
   protection with NVDs, conduct pre flight adjustments wearing both (T-1).

3.14. Oxygen and Pressurization Requirements (N/A for UAS).
   3.14.1. Oxygen. Ensure sufficient oxygen for the planned mission is available to all
   occupants before takeoff (T-0). Normally, aircrew will use supplemental oxygen any time the
   cabin altitude exceeds 10,000 ft. MSL.
   3.14.2. Unpressurized Operations. When mission essential, aircrew trained IAW AFI 11-
   403, Aerospace Physiological Training Program, may operate aircraft unpressurized up to
   Flight Level (FL) 250 IAW MAJCOM guidance and the following restrictions (T-1):
      3.14.2.1. Without supplemental oxygen:
          3.14.2.1.1. Altitude is limited to 14,000 ft. MSL.
          3.14.2.1.2. Flight time between 10,000 and 12,500 ft. MSL is unrestricted, but shall
          not exceed 1 hour if any portion of the flight is conducted in IMC, at night (with or
          without NVDs), while employing weapons, conducting airdrop, air-refueling, or if
          performing high-g maneuvers.
          3.14.2.1.3. Flight time between 12,500 and 14,000 ft. MSL shall not exceed 30
          minutes.

NOTE 1: Single-pilot aircraft must follow the most restrictive guidance in this table.

NOTE 2: Cockpit crew is defined as those crew positions with access to flight controls or
 responsibility for flight engineer panel, communication, or navigation systems.

LEGEND:

A - Oxygen available. Carry or place portable oxygen units or extra oxygen outlets with masks throughout the
   cabin/cargo area so that any person has quick access to oxygen should a loss of pressurization occur.

R - Oxygen readily available. A functioning system and mask shall be located within arm’s reach, and the
   regulator must be set to 100 percent and ON (when regulator is adjustable).

I - Oxygen immediately available. Must wear helmets with an oxygen mask attached to one side, or have available
    an approved quick-don style mask properly adjusted and positioned. Regulators shall be set to 100 percent and
    ON.

O - Oxygen mask ON. Regulator ON and normal.

G - Wear a partial pressure suit. Suit must provide 70mm Hg of assisted positive pressure breathing for altitude
   (pressure breathing for altitude system/get-me-down scenario).

S - Wear a pressure suit. Suit must provide a total pressure (atmospheric plus suit differential) of at least 141mm
    Hg to the head and neck with adequate body coverage to prevent edema and embolism.
AFI11-202V3 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                     21


   3.14.4. Procedures for Loss of Cabin Pressure. Initiate an immediate descent to the
   lowest practical altitude, preferably below 18,000 ft. MSL. Do not allow cabin altitude to
   remain above FL250 unless occupants are wearing functional pressure suits (T-1). If any
   occupant lacks functioning oxygen equipment, descend to an altitude of 13,000 ft. MSL or
   less (terrain or fuel requirements permitting) and comply with paragraph 3.14.2. (T-1).
       3.14.4.1. If cabin altitude exceeds 18,000 ft. MSL following the unintended loss of cabin
       pressure, aircrew and passengers must be evaluated by a flight surgeon or other aviation
       medical authority prior to further flight (T-1). If cabin altitude cannot be determined, use
       the aircraft altitude at the time of the event. Report a loss of cabin pressurization IAW
       AFMAN 91-223.
   3.14.5. Decompression Sickness (DCS). If any occupant exhibits DCS symptoms, descend
   as soon as practical and land at the nearest suitable installation where medical assistance can
   be obtained (T-1). Individuals suspected of DCS shall be administered and remain on 100%
   oxygen (using tight-fitting mask or equivalent) until evaluated by an aviation medical
   authority (T-1). Decompression sickness may occur up to 12 hours after landing. Aircrew
   will not fly after a DCS event without specific authorization from a flight surgeon (T-1).
   3.14.6. Hypoxia. If anyone on the aircraft experiences hypoxia symptoms, descend
   immediately to the lowest practical altitude and land at a suitable location to obtain medical
   assistance (T-1). Aircrew will not fly after a hypoxia event without specific authorization
   from a flight surgeon (T-1). For hypoxia symptoms caused by an On-Board Oxygen
   Generation System (OBOGS), follow MDS-specific guidance.
   3.14.7. High Altitude Operations. Without functional pressure suits, maintain a cabin
   altitude below FL250 and adhere to the time limits in Table 3.2. (T-1). For high-altitude
   airdrop missions, use the oxygen requirements in AFI 11-409, High Altitude Airdrop Mission
   Support Procedures. If the aircraft lands between missions and the time on the ground equals
   or exceeds the time spent at or above a cabin altitude of FL210, the time of allowable
   duration can be reset to the maximum (T-1).

Table 3.2. Cabin Altitude Time Limits (DCS Prevention) (N/A for U-2 Operations).

3.15. Aircraft Lighting. Operate aircraft lighting according to the following guidance or IAW
host-nation rules and theater SPINS (T-0):
 22                                                          AFI11-202V3 7 NOVEMBER 2014


   3.15.1. Position Lights. Illuminate position lights (one per side minimum) between official
   sunset and sunrise (T-0); and,
       3.15.1.1. When an engine is starting or running. Aircraft that do not have power
       available before start shall turn them on as soon as power is available (T-0); or,
       3.15.1.2. While being towed, or when parked in an area likely to create a hazard, unless
       clearly illuminated by an outside source (T-0).
   3.15.2. Anti-collision or Strobe Lights. If equipped, turn anti-collision or strobe lights on
   from just prior to engine start until engine shutdown (T-0).
       3.15.2.1. Aircraft that do not have power available before engine start shall turn anti-
       collision or strobe lights on as soon as power is available (T-0).
       3.15.2.2. Flashing lights may be switched off or reduced in intensity if they adversely
       affect the performance of duties, or subject an outside observer to harmful glare (T-0).
   3.15.3. Landing Lights. If equipped, landing lights should be turned on when takeoff
   clearance is received, when commencing takeoff roll at an airport without an operating
   control tower, or when operating below 10,000 ft. MSL within normal MDS-specific
   operating procedures.
   3.15.4. Reduced Aircraft Lighting. MAJCOMs may authorize reduced or lights-out
   operations in restricted areas, warning areas, host-nation approved areas, or designated
   airfields. Designated airfields shall be documented in a Letter of Agreement (LOA) (T-0).
3.16. Airfield Lighting.
   3.16.1. Fixed-wing operations at night:
       3.16.1.1. Will not be conducted from a runway unless it is outlined with operable
       lighting or high-intensity runway reflective markers and is clearly discernible (T-2).
       3.16.1.2. Are restricted to military airfields or civilian airports with an appropriate LOA
       during non-contingency operations from unlighted runways or landing zones (or those
       using high-intensity runway reflective markers) (T-0).
       3.16.1.3. Must comply with MDS-specific operating instructions, including
       comprehensive risk mitigation measures (such as infrared (IR) lighting requirements,
       NVD usage, non-participating aircraft procedures, NOTAM issuance, weather and lunar
       illumination requirements and RM assessments) (T-2).
   3.16.2. Covert IR runway lighting used by qualified crews equipped with NVDs meets the
   intent of lighted landing surface.
   3.16.3. Extreme Latitudes. In Alaska, areas located north of 60° North latitude, Antarctica,
   and areas located south of 60° South latitude, aircraft may be operated to unlighted airports
   during the period of civil twilight (T-0).
3.17. Right-of-Way. Each pilot must take whatever action is necessary to avoid collision,
regardless of who has the right-of-way. The yielding aircraft must not pass over, under, abeam,
or ahead of the other aircraft until well clear.
   3.17.1. Distress. Aircraft in distress have the right-of-way over all other air traffic.
AFI11-202V3 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                        23


   3.17.2. Converging. When converging at approximately the same altitude (except head-on
   or approximately so), the aircraft to the other's right has the right-of-way. Aircraft of different
   categories have the right-of-way in the following order of priority: balloons, gliders, aircraft
   towing or refueling other aircraft, airships, rotary- or fixed-wing aircraft.
   3.17.3. Approaching Head-On. If aircraft are approaching each other head-on or
   approximately so, each shall alter course to the right.
   3.17.4. Overtaking Aircraft. An overtaken aircraft has the right-of-way. The overtaking
   aircraft must alter course to the right.
   3.17.5. Landing. An aircraft established on final approach has the right-of-way over other
   aircraft on the ground or in the air, except when two or more aircraft are approaching to land.
   In this case, the aircraft at the lower altitude has the right-of-way but it shall not use this
   advantage to cut in front of or overtake the other.
3.18. Sense and Avoid. Pilots under instrument flight rules (IFR) or visual flight rules (VFR),
whether or not under radar control, are responsible for avoiding traffic, terrain/obstacles, and
environmental hazards.
   3.18.1. Standard IFR separation is provided between aircraft operating under IFR in
   controlled airspace. Within the National Airspace System (NAS), ATC provides traffic
   advisories on VFR aircraft on a time-permitting basis. Outside the NAS, consult ICAO and
   country-specific guidance outlined in the FCG and FLIP.
   3.18.2. UAS without approved sense and avoid capabilities will be operated under specific
   arrangements with appropriate aviation authorities (e.g., FAA, host nation, or military
   control).
3.19. Proximity of Aircraft. Do not allow the aircraft to be flown so close to another that it
creates a collision hazard. Use 500 ft. of separation as an approximate guide except for:
   3.19.1. Authorized formation flights.
   3.19.2. Emergency situations requiring assistance from another aircraft. If an emergency
   requires visual checks of an aircraft in distress, exercise extreme care to ensure this action
   does not increase the overall hazard. The capabilities of the distressed aircraft and the
   intentions of the crews involved must be considered before operating near another aircraft in
   flight.
   3.19.3. MAJCOM-approved maneuvers in which participants are aware of the nature of the
   maneuver and qualified to conduct it safely (e.g. interceptor visual identification training).
3.20. Dropping Parachutists, Stores, or Other Objects. Do not allow objects to be dropped
except in an emergency or when required for mission accomplishment. Report any accidental
loss of equipment, aircraft parts, or cargo IAW AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting, and
AFMAN 91-223.
3.21. Fuel Jettison. Do not jettison fuel except in an emergency or when required for mission
accomplishment. When jettisoning fuel and circumstances permit, provide the appropriate ATC
or flight service facility with intentions, altitude, location, and completion time. Report any
jettisoning of fuel IAW AFI 10-206.

3.22. Radio, Laser, and Other Electromagnetic Emitter Restrictions. Equipment which
transmits radio, laser, or other energy will only be operated for the intended purpose and in the
authorized manner to prevent unintentional interference, damage, or injury (T-0).
3.23. Communication, Navigation, and Surveillance Equipment. Operate equipment as
authorized by the MAJCOM. MAJCOMs will establish tactical operations guidance. When
operating in controlled airspace under IFR, immediately report to ATC the loss or impairment of
navigational, air-to-ground communications, or surveillance capability IAW the FIH.
   3.23.1. Transponders. Operate the transponder IAW ATC instructions, host nation,
   MAJCOM directives, and theater SPINS (T-0). In the NAS, transponders will be operated in
   controlled airspace, including Mode C if installed, on the appropriate code or as assigned by
   ATC (T-0). Additionally, unless local procedures dictate otherwise, transponders should be
   turned to the “ON” or normal altitude reporting position prior to aircraft movement (T-0).
       3.23.1.1. Mode S Flight ID. Prior to each flight, ensure the Mode S Flight ID matches
       the call sign entered exactly on the flight plan with no embedded spaces, dashes, extra
       characters, or added zeros (T-0). When the flight plan call sign is less than seven
       characters, place blank spaces only at the end.
       3.23.1.2. Mode S Address. Prior to each flight, ensure the Mode S address is entered
       correctly. MAJCOMs will manage assigned dynamic addresses to ensure no two aircraft
       are airborne with the same address.
       3.23.1.3. Mode 4/5. If required, Mode 4/5 operations are outlined in the Flight
       Information Handbook (See MODE 4/5 in glossary).
   3.23.2. Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). Aircraft equipped with TCAS shall
   operate in the TCAS mode that provides both Traffic Alerts (TAs) and Resolution Advisories
   (RAs) unless otherwise dictated by the aircraft manual, formation flight requirements,
   MAJCOM guidance, mission requirements, or host-nation agreements.
       3.23.2.1. TCAS on the Ground. While on the ground, operate in standby or TA Only (T-
       0). TA/RA will be selected during takeoff and landing (T-0).
       3.23.2.2. Response to TCAS Alerts. Respond to all RAs regardless of ATC instructions,
       right-of-way rules, cloud clearance requirements, or other VFR/IFR flight rules, as
       directed by TCAS unless doing so would jeopardize the safe operation of the aircraft
       (e.g., descent into obstacles).
           3.23.2.2.1. Do not deviate from an assigned ATC clearance based solely on TA
           information. Attempt to attain visual contact and maintain safe separation.
           3.23.2.2.2. In the event of an RA, alter the flight path only to the extent necessary to
           comply with the RA.
           3.23.2.2.3. After deviating from an ATC clearance in response to an RA, notify ATC
           of the deviation as soon as practical and promptly return to the current ATC clearance
           when the traffic conflict is resolved or obtain a new clearance.
   3.23.3. Terrain Awareness and Warning Systems (TAWS). Comply with appropriate
   flight manual procedures and MAJCOM guidance upon receipt of a Ground Proximity
   Warning System (GPWS)/TAWS/Enhanced GPWS (EGPWS)/Ground Collision Avoidance

   System (GCAS) warning. During VMC flight, terrain warnings do not need to be followed if
   the pilot can verify the warning is false by visual contact with terrain or obstacles.
   3.23.4. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Equipment.
      3.23.4.1. GPS Equipment. MAJCOMs will determine if GPS is approved as the primary
      means of navigation and provide guidance for its use. If GPS is not approved as primary,
      ensure the approved primary means of navigation (e.g., VOR, TAC, etc.) is operational
      and monitored (T-0).
      3.23.4.2. GPS Standard Position Service (SPS) and Precise Position Service (PPS).
      Follow MAJCOM or SPINS guidance on use of SPS/PPS.
      3.23.4.3. Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) is required unless integrity
      is ensured by other means approved by the MAJCOM (T-0).
          3.23.4.3.1. Active RAIM. If RAIM is not available, actively monitor an alternate
          means of navigation and inform ATC of any degraded capability (T-0).
          3.23.4.3.2. Predictive RAIM (P-RAIM). Check P-RAIM prior to departure when
          possible (T-0). If RAIM is predicted to be unavailable for more than five minutes
          along the route of flight, the flight must rely on other approved equipment, be
          rerouted, or delayed (T-0). Not required if Wide-Area Augmentation System
          (WAAS) enabled and flight is in WAAS coverage area (T-0).

       3.24.4.1. Only one aircraft (normally the lead) of a standard formation should squawk
       (T-0).
       3.24.4.2. Unless otherwise directed, receivers will not squawk when less than 3 nautical
       miles (NM) from the tanker (T-0).
       3.24.4.3. Unless otherwise directed by ATC, all aircraft within a non-standard formation
       flight will squawk until established within the assigned altitude block and closed to the
       proper en route interval (T-0). When aircraft interval exceeds 3 NM, both the formation
       leader and the last aircraft will squawk (T-0).
   3.24.5. Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) Operations.
       3.24.5.1. Formation leads (and last aircraft, when formation length exceeds 3 NM) shall
       operate in TA mode unless otherwise required by ATC, host-nation agreement or
       specified in the MDS-specific guidance (T-0).
       3.24.5.2. During refueling operations, the tanker aircraft will operate in TA mode (T-0).
   3.24.6. Non-standard Formations. Non-standard formation flights may be conducted:
       3.24.6.1. When approved by ATC;
       3.24.6.2. Operating under VFR in visual meteorological conditions (VMC);
       3.24.6.3. Operating within an authorized Altitude Reservation (ALTRV);
       3.24.6.4. Operating under the provisions of a Letter of Agreement (LOA); or,
       3.24.6.5. Operating in airspace specifically designated for a special activity.
3.25. Large Scale Exercises. MAJCOMs will conduct large-scale exercises in permanent or
temporary special-use airspace (SUA) established according to FAA Joint Order (JO) 7400.2,
Procedures for Handling Airspace Matters, and FAA JO 7610.4, Special Operation. When
MAJCOMs approve large-scale exercises or short-term special missions they will ensure
information on approved activities is available to the non-participating flying public and
coordinate these operations with:
   3.25.1. Affected non-participating military flying units;
   3.25.2. Affected FAA Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC);
   3.25.3. Affected FAA regions through the Air Force representative (AFREP); and,
   3.25.4. Other agencies, as appropriate.

Airspace (ATCAA), military training routes (MTRs) or host-nation approved airspace IAW the
guidelines in AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures (T-0). Aircraft deployed or
based at overseas locations will operate IAW applicable host-nation agreements or ICAO SARPs
(T-0). If the aircraft operating requirements (altitude requirements, maximum airspeeds,
dropping of objects, etc.) dictated in the host-nation agreement are less restrictive than
USAF/MAJCOM guidance, the most restrictive guidance shall be used (T-1).
3.27. Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) Airspace. Aircraft will not operate in TFR
airspace unless authorized (T-0).
AFI11-202V3 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                        27


3.28. Uncontrolled Field Procedures. Use runway favored by the winds if no other factors
make that runway unacceptable (T-0). Announce your activities on the appropriate frequencies
(T-0). UAS operations are prohibited at uncontrolled fields when other traffic is present (T-2).
3.29. Obstacle Clearance Responsibility. Pilots are never relieved of the responsibility for
terrain and obstacle avoidance. The radio call “Radar Contact” only means the aircraft has been
identified on radar. Responsibility is shared between pilot and controller only after navigational
guidance is issued.
3.30. Participating in Aerial Events. Ensure compliance with AFI 11-209 when participating
in aerial events, demonstrations, and static displays.
3.31. Simulated Instrument Flight.
   3.31.1. For non-qualified instrument pilots, a safety observer who is able to clear outside at
   all times, should accompany the flight either as a crewmember or in a chase aircraft (T-0). If
   a chase aircraft is used, maintain continuous visual contact and two-way communications
   between aircraft (T-1). A safety observer is defined as a current and qualified instrument
   pilot or a fighter weapons systems operator (or other MAJCOM-designated aircrew member)
   with access to a set of flight controls (T-1).
   3.31.2. Vision Restricting Devices. MAJCOMs must approve the use of vision restricting
   devices and provide specific approval for use during takeoffs and landings. Vision restricting
   devices will not be used without a safety observer (T-0).
       3.31.2.1. Maintain at least 2,000 ft. of obstruction clearance when using vision restricting
       devices if the safety observer is in a chase aircraft, or not qualified as a pilot, or does not
       have full view of the flight instruments and access to the flight controls (T-1).
   3.31.1. When not on an IFR flight plan, the aircraft must be equipped with a functional two-
   way radio and have the airport environment in sight when established on the final segment of
   an approach (T-0).
3.32. Simulated Emergency Flight Procedures.
   3.32.1. Terminate simulated emergency training if an actual emergency occurs.
   3.32.2. MAJCOMs must provide guidance when an instructor pilot or flight examiner does
   not have immediate access to the aircraft controls.
   3.32.3. Passengers will not be onboard (T-1). Exception: simulated emergencies may be
   performed with passengers onboard if there is no flight deck crew participation; flight deck
   crew may participate with MAJCOM approval. (N/A for UAS).
   3.32.4. Single-pilot aircraft require day (including civil twilight) VMC (N/A for UAS) (T-1).
   3.32.5. Multi-pilot aircraft in day IMC require weather conditions at or above published
   circling minimums for the approach to be flown (N/A for UAS) (T-1).
   3.32.6. Multi-pilot aircraft at night require weather conditions at or above 1,000 ft. ceiling
   and 2 SM visibility or circling minimums, whichever is higher (N/A for UAS) (T-1).
   3.32.7. Simulated Flameout, Forced Landing, or Emergency Landing Patterns (SFO/ELP).
   At controlled fields where SFO/ELP maneuvers are conducted, the facility air traffic

   manager shall issue an LOA with the appropriate military authority and adjacent facilities as
   required. The LOA shall conform to FAA Joint Order (FAA JO) 7610.4. (T-0).
       3.32.7.1. MAJCOMs must provide guidance for SFO/ELP approaches when the T.O.s do
       not provide specific guidance; the approaches do not conform to the T.O. guidance; the
       approaches have not been coordinated with the ATC responsible for the airspace; or the
       airport/landing area does not have a prepared runway surface, an active tower/Runway
       Supervisory Unit (RSU), enough runway, or proper crash/rescue equipment (T-0).
3.33. Vertical-Lift Operations. For this instruction, tilt-rotor aircraft in vertical-flight mode
will follow helicopter guidance (T-1). MAJCOMs will provide guidance on determining phase-
of-flight for aircraft capable of transition to/from vertical flight.
AFI11-202V3 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                      29

an appearance of government waste or abuse.
4.7. Military and Joint-Use Airports. Aircrew may file to and land at US military and Joint-
Use (i.e. MIL/CIV) fields.
4.8. Civil Airports.
   4.8.1. MAJCOMs may authorize filing to or landing at civil airfields. Use of civil facilities
   not governed by agreement or law may result in landing fees or use fees charged to the pilot
   or the military unit.
   4.8.2. “P-coded” Civil Airports (as listed in the IFR Supplement). Aircrew may file to or
   land USAF aircraft at US civil public airports when:
       4.8.2.1. In an emergency;

   websites, flight planning services).
   4.12.2. Runway Visual Range (RVR). RVR reports apply to all takeoffs, landings, and
   approaches to the runway and take precedence over any other visibility report for that
   runway. Use the static RVR when available. If only a variable RVR report is received and a
   static RVR cannot be determined, apply the lowest reported RVR value. If necessary, convert
   the reported visibility from one format to another (e.g. RVR to Prevailing Visibility (PV))
   only for takeoffs and straight-in approaches using the conversion tables printed in the front of
   the Terminal Procedures Publication (TPP) booklet. For conversions, use the higher value; do
   not interpolate (T-0).
4.13. Aeronautical Information and Publications. Operational commanders are responsible
for providing their crews with access to appropriate aeronautical information and publications for
flight (T-1).
   4.13.1. Authorized Information and Publications. Obtain and use information or
   publications from US Government (USG) sources as first preference (T-0). Do not use

   publish MDS-specific information for use of RAIM prediction procedures.
       4.13.6.1. Precise Positioning Service (PPS) RAIM. MAJCOMS may authorize use of
       civil (i.e. Standard Positioning Service (SPS)) RAIM prediction services if a PPS RAIM
       prediction tool is not available.
4.14. Area Navigation (RNAV) and Required Navigation Performance (RNP).
   4.14.1. Before flight, confirm the availability of the performance-based operations
   infrastructure for the intended route and procedures (T-0).
   4.14.2. If a specified RNP level cannot be achieved, revise the route or delay departure until
   the appropriate RNP level can be assured (T-0).
   4.14.3. The onboard navigation database should be current for the region of intended
   operation (T-2). MAJCOMs will publish guidance for continued enroute operations with a
   non-current navigation database. For terminal procedure guidance see paragraph 7.3.2.

          published landing minimums (TEMPO conditions may be below published
          minimums at ETA 1 hour) (T-0). Helicopters may reduce visibility by one-half, but
          no lower than 1/4 SM PV or 1,200 ft. RVR (T-0). See paragraph 4.15.3. for alternate
          requirements (T-0). Exception: MAJCOMs may authorize filing to a destination with
          weather below the lowest compatible landing minimums, but must establish
AFI11-202V3 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                               33


        supplemental recovery procedures such as the use of two or more alternate airports,
        additional holding fuel, etc.
            4.15.2.1.1.1. For a straight-in or sidestep approach, the forecast weather must
            meet required visibility minimums (T-0).
            4.15.2.1.1.2. For a circling approach, the forecast weather must meet both the
            ceiling and prevailing visibility minimums (T-0).
            4.15.2.1.1.3. For an RNAV/RNP/GNSS approach based on SBAS and annotated
            with the “W” symbol, weather must meet Lateral Navigation (LNAV) minimums
            (T-0).
        4.15.2.1.2. UAS. In the absence of MAJCOM UAS weather guidance, follow
        manned fixed-wing and helicopter weather requirements.
     4.15.2.2. Available Instrument Approach.
        4.15.2.2.1. Pilots may file IFR to a destination or an alternate with a compatible
        instrument approach (T-0). If there is no compatible published approach at the
        destination, pilots may file to a point served by a published approach where forecast
        weather at ETA 1 hour allows the pilot to continue on a composite IFR/VFR flight
        plan to the destination (T-0).
  4.15.3. Requiring an IFR Alternate.
     4.15.3.1. Weather. An alternate is required when the worst weather at destination, to
     include TEMPO conditions, at the ETA 1 hour is less than:
        4.15.3.1.1. Fixed-Wing Aircraft. A ceiling of 2,000 ft. and a visibility of 3 SM (T-
        1). MAJCOMs may lower this requirement as low as a ceiling of 1,000 ft. and a
        visibility of 2 SM if two or more suitable independent precision approaches are
        available and operable for the airport of intended landing at ETA 1 hour.
        4.15.3.1.2. Helicopters. A ceiling of 1,000 ft. (or 400 ft. above the lowest
        compatible approach minimums, whichever is higher) and a visibility of 2 SM (T-1).
        4.15.3.1.3. UAS. MAJCOMs will determine alternate airfield policies for UAS.
     4.15.3.2. Other Conditions Requiring an Alternate:
        4.15.3.2.1. All compatible approaches require radar (T-1);
        4.15.3.2.2. Required navigational aids (NAVAID) will be unmonitored (T-1);
        4.15.3.2.3. The destination has no weather reporting capability (T-1); or,
        4.15.3.2.4. The airfield’s lowest compatible approach weather minimums are greater
        than or equal to a 1,500 ft. ceiling or 3 SM visibility (T-1).
     4.15.3.3. Exceptions:
        4.15.3.3.1. Remote or Island Destinations. MAJCOMs may authorize holding for a
        specified time in lieu of filing an alternate for remote or island destinations.
        MAJCOMs will define remote or island destinations and prescribe weather criteria
        and recovery procedures.
 34                                                         AFI11-202V3 7 NOVEMBER 2014


          4.15.3.3.2. Alternate requirement may be cancelled enroute if weather conditions
          improve at destination to exceed paragraph 4.15.3.1.
      4.15.3.4. Selecting an Alternate. The worst alternate forecast weather conditions for
      ETA 1 hour, to include TEMPO conditions (except those caused by thunderstorms, rain,
      or snow showers), will meet or exceed:
          4.15.3.4.1. Fixed-Wing Aircraft. A ceiling of 1000 ft., or 500 ft. above the lowest
          compatible minimum, whichever is higher; and a visibility of 2 SM or 1 SM above
          the lowest compatible minimum, whichever is higher (T-1).
          4.15.3.4.2. Helicopters. A ceiling of at least 200 ft. above, and a visibility of at least
          1 SM above the lowest compatible published landing minimum (T-1).
          4.15.3.4.3. UAS. MAJCOMs will establish UAS alternate airfield policies.
      4.15.3.5. Conditions Disqualifying an Alternate. The disqualifying conditions below
      may be listed throughout various sources (e.g., TPP, NOTAMs, IFR Supplement):
          4.15.3.5.1. All compatible approaches require radar (T-1).
          4.15.3.5.2. All compatible approaches require an unmonitored NAVAID (T-1).
          4.15.3.5.3. The airfield does not have a weather reporting service (T-1).
          4.15.3.5.4. “   NA” (Alternate Not Authorized) on all compatible approaches (T-1).
          4.15.3.5.5. Any note disqualifying the airfield or all compatible approaches in the
          IFR Alternate Minimums section     (T-1).
          4.15.3.5.6. All compatible approaches at the alternate require use of GNSS and
          planning to the destination was also based on the use of only GNSS approaches (T-1).
          Exception: Aircraft with approved WAAS/SBAS equipment if a WAAS compatible
          approach is available (T-1). Alternate weather planning will only be based on the
          LNAV minimums (T-1).
      4.15.3.6. MAJCOM Exception. MAJCOM/A3 may authorize the use of any airfield as
      an alternate regardless of weather conditions if mission justifies the increased risk. This
      authority may not be further delegated.
4.16. VFR Flight.
   4.16.1. Weather. The forecast weather for the departure, planned route of flight, and arrival (
   1 hour of the ETA) must be at or better than the minimums contained in Table 6.1. or 6.2. (T-
   1).
   4.16.2. Fly aircraft under VFR only when required for mission accomplishment. Mission
   examples include: operational necessity, host-nation requirements, training, proficiency or
   evaluation sorties, aircraft equipment that precludes IFR flight, and ATC or NAVAID
   limitations that preclude IFR flight. Comply with the AFMAN 11-217 series and the
   following:
      4.16.2.1. Ensure VFR operations are authorized and properly planned.
      4.16.2.2. Utilize radar advisory and monitoring or control services when practical to
      ensure flight following by any available means (e.g. FSS or C2 agency).
AFI11-202V3 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                         35


       4.16.2.3. When conditions (weather, airspace, etc.) prevent completing the mission under
       VFR, alter route and continue under VFR until reaching the destination, obtaining an IFR
       clearance, or landing at a suitable location.
       4.16.2.4. When conducting tactical operations, fly under VFR unless compliance with
       VFR degrades mission accomplishment.
       4.16.2.5. Special VFR (SVFR). Fixed-wing aircraft shall not fly under SVFR (T-1).
       MAJCOMs may allow helicopter aircrews to fly under SVFR IAW 14 CFR §91.157
       (within the NAS) or appropriate host-nation guidance.
       4.16.2.6. VFR Over-the-Top. When operating VFR above a ceiling, comply with
       AFMAN 11-217 (T-1).
       4.16.2.7. IFR "VFR-on-Top." Pilots may request "VFR on Top" operations (IAW
       AFMAN 11-217) when the mission dictates.
4.17. Flight Plans.
   4.17.1. Ensure a flight plan is filed IAW MAJCOM guidance for any flight. By filing a flight
   plan, the PIC certifies:
       4.17.1.1. The flight was properly ordered, authorized, and released IAW AFI 11-401;
       4.17.1.2. The flight will be conducted IAW all governing directives (see paragraph 1.2.);
       4.17.1.3. Compliance with paragraph 4.5;
       4.17.1.4. The flight plan has been reviewed for completeness and accuracy;
       4.17.1.5. Responsibility for the safety of the aircraft, the formation, and its occupants;
       4.17.1.6. The flight complies with Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) restrictions
       and SUA or MTR scheduling and coordination procedures specified in FLIP and
       NOTAMs.
   4.17.2. Passenger Manifests and Crew Lists. List passengers on a DD Form 2131,
   Passenger Manifest, or a MAJCOM-approved form (T-0). File the manifest and crew list
   with the flight plan, the passenger service facility, or other responsible agency (T-0). Notify
   C2 prior to departure if there is a passenger manifest (or crew list) change (T-1). When able,
   process crew and manifest changes with the original processing facility or with a responsible
   agency.
   4.17.3. Flight Plan Changes. The format for making changes to a flight plan is printed on
   the back of the DoD IFR Supplement. Ensure ATC and/or destination is aware of changes to
   prevent erroneous Search and Rescue (SAR) or unannounced arrival. Before takeoff or while
   airborne, changes may be made to the original filed flight plan without re-filing provided:
       4.17.3.1. The change does not penetrate an ADIZ;
       4.17.3.2. The controlling ATC agency approves the change for an IFR flight; or,
       4.17.3.3. The change complies with applicable host-nation rules.
   4.17.4. Closing the Flight Plan. When landing at a tower-controlled airfield in the NAS,
   the flight plan should close automatically. In all other cases, close flight plans with an FSS or
   ATC facility by any means of communication available (T-0).
 36                                                         AFI11-202V3 7 NOVEMBER 2014


4.18. Fuel Requirements.
   4.18.1. Ensure sufficient fuel is available onboard the aircraft to comply with the
   requirements of this instruction and safely conduct the flight (T-0). Use MAJCOM-approved
   fuel efficiency techniques and procedures to the maximum extent practical. Before takeoff or
   immediately after in-flight refueling, the aircraft must have enough usable fuel to complete
   the flight:
       4.18.1.1. To a final landing, either at the destination airport or alternate airport (if
       required), plus fuel reserves; or,
       4.18.1.2. Between Air Refueling Control Points (ARCPs) and then to land at the
       destination (or a recovery base, if refueling is not successful), plus the fuel reserve.
          4.18.1.2.1. Helicopters may fly between ARCPs without required fuel to destination
          or recovery base in the event of an unsuccessful air refueling.
   4.18.2. Alternate Airport Fuel Requirements. When an alternate airport is required, fuel
   required for an approach and missed approach must be included in the total flight plan fuel if
   visibility-only weather criteria is used at destination (T-1). Fuel required for a missed
   approach is not required if both ceiling and visibility criteria are used.
   4.18.3. Fuel Reserve. Ensure the aircraft is carrying enough usable fuel on each flight to
   increase the total planned flight time between refueling points by 10 percent (up to a
   maximum of 45 minutes for fixed-wing or 30 minutes for helicopters) or 20 minutes,
   whichever is greater (T-1). Compute fuel reserves using MAJCOM-defined consumption
   rates for normal cruising speeds or the following:
       4.18.3.1. For reciprocating engine aircraft and helicopters, use fuel consumption rates for
       normal cruising altitudes (T-1).
       4.18.3.2. For turbine-powered aircraft use fuel consumption rates that provide best
       endurance at 10,000 ft. MSL (T-1).
       4.18.3.3. If the MAJCOM authorizes holding (instead of an alternate airport) for a
       remote or island destination, do not consider the prescribed holding time as part of the
       total planned flight time or fuel reserve (T-1).
   4.18.4. Equal Time Point (ETP). In the absence of MDS-specific guidance, multi-engine
   aircraft without the availability to in-flight refuel, operated for extended periods over large
   bodies of water or desolate land areas (outside gliding distance to a suitable landing site)
   shall calculate and plot on a navigational chart an ETP to a suitable alternate for that mission
   leg. Contingency fuel requirements shall also be planned (i.e. engine-out depressurized flight
   from an ETP to a suitable landing site) (T-1).
4.19. Preflight Briefings.
   4.19.1. Prior to flight, ensure each crewmember and passenger is briefed on items affecting
   safety or mission completion (T-0). At a minimum, briefings will include:
       4.19.1.1. Emergency signals and procedures (T-0);
AFI11-202V3 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                            37


     4.19.1.2. Aircrew and passenger flight equipment/systems usage information to include
     the location and use of emergency exits, parachutes, oxygen, communications systems,
     and survival equipment (T-0); and,
     4.19.1.3. Safety precautions and restrictions to include Foreign Object Damage (FOD)
     hazards and electronic device prohibitions (T-1).

                                           Chapter 5

                                         DEPARTURE

5.1. Weather.
   5.1.1. Minimum Takeoff Weather. Takeoffs are prohibited when existing weather is
   below landing minimums (T-2). Takeoff visibility must be greater than 500 RVR (150
   meters) (T-1). MAJCOMs will publish alternative takeoff minimums and recovery
   procedures when takeoff weather is lower than published landing minimums.
       5.1.1.1. Fixed-wing RVR Requirements. Minimums below 1600 RVR are not authorized
       unless the runway has operating centerline lights, visible runway centerline markings,
       and two operative RVR reporting systems (T-1). All RVR readings must meet or exceed
       minimum authorized values for departure (T-1).
   5.1.2. Freezing Precipitation. Do not takeoff with ice, snow, frost, or other contamination
   adhering to the wings, control surfaces, propellers, engine inlets, or other critical surfaces of
   the aircraft, unless authorized by the flight manual (T-2).
       5.1.2.1. A thin coating of frost is permitted on the fuselage, provided the lettering and/or
       paint lines are visible.
       5.1.2.2. Light frost (up to 1/8 inch thick) caused by super-cooled fuel is permitted on the
       lower wing surface (i.e., below the fuel tank area) if the fuselage and all other control
       surfaces are free of icing. If deicing is required on any other aircraft surface, the under
       wing frost shall also be removed (T-2).
       5.1.2.3. Information on the removal and prevention of frozen precipitation is contained
       in AF T.O. 42C-1-2, Anti-Icing, De-Icing and Defrosting of Parked Aircraft.
   5.1.3. Takeoff Near Hazardous Weather. Do not takeoff where thunderstorms or other
   hazardous conditions are producing hail, strong winds, gust fronts, heavy rain, lightning,
   wind shear, or microbursts (T-1).
5.2. Turns after Takeoff. Do not turn after a takeoff until at least 400 ft. above the Departure
End of the Runway (DER) elevation, at a safe airspeed, and past the end of the runway (if
visible) unless specifically cleared by the controlling agency, required by a published procedure,
or when executing a closed pattern (T-0).
5.3. VFR Climb Performance. Unless specifically authorized, fixed-wing multi-engine aircraft
will not depart a location under VFR without ensuring that they can vertically clear published
IFR departure procedure restrictions along the planned departure route with one engine
inoperative (OEI) (T-2).
5.4. IFR Climb Performance. Unless otherwise published and charted with “ATC”
designation, all climb gradients must be assumed to be obstacle based. Only MAJCOM-
authorized procedures for climb performance assessment may be used (vice locally developed
procedures). MAJCOMs may authorize SDPs. Aircrew must be trained before use of any SDP.
   5.4.1. Low Close-in Obstacles. Ensure the aircraft can vertically clear applicable published
   low close-in obstacles along the planned ground track. Low close-in obstacles may be listed
AFI11-202V3 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                      39


   in the Obstacle Departure Procedures           (ODP) section, NOTAMs, or charted on the
   published procedure. Published or ATC climb gradients do not account for low close-in
   obstacles in their climb gradient calculations; therefore, low close-in obstacle clearance is not
   assured when complying with the published or ATC climb gradient.
   5.4.2. ATC Climb Gradient. Aircraft are required to meet ATC climb gradients with all
   engines operating (AEO) (T-0). If the aircraft does not have the computed performance to
   meet the charted ATC climb gradient, coordinate with ATC prior to flight.
   5.4.3. Obstacle Climb Gradient.
      5.4.3.1. Ensure the aircraft can comply with the respective obstacle climb gradients
      below:
          5.4.3.1.1. Single Engine Aircraft and Helicopters. Ensure the aircraft can meet or
          exceed 200 ft/NM or the published climb gradient, whichever is higher, to an
          appropriate IFR altitude (T-0).
          5.4.3.1.2. Multi-Engine Fixed-Wing Aircraft. With OEI, ensure the aircraft can
          meet 200 ft/NM or the published climb gradient, whichever is higher, to an
          appropriate IFR altitude (T-0).
              5.4.3.1.2.1. If unable to meet published obstacle climb gradient OEI, and
              operationally necessary, the MAJCOM/A3 may authorize subtraction of up to
              48’/NM from the required obstacle climb gradient. This authority may be further
              delegated, but may not be delegated to the respective aircrew for which the waiver
              would apply (T-1). Subtraction does not apply to SDPs.
      5.4.3.2. If unable to meet the required obstacle climb gradient, consider aircraft, mission,
      or environmental changes such as reducing aircraft gross weight or delaying for more
      favorable weather conditions. If still unable to comply with the required obstacle climb
      gradient, an IFR departure is not authorized (T-0).
          5.4.3.2.1. If the mission justifies the increased risk, MAJCOM/A3 may authorize a
          departure in VMC regardless of climb gradient compliance. This authority may not be
          further delegated (T-1).
5.5. IFR Departure Methods. Obstacle Departure Procedures (ODPs) and/or Standard
Instrument Departures (SIDs) should be flown to the maximum extent possible.
   5.5.1. Depart IFR using one, or a combination of, the methods listed below. If the airport
   does not have one of these IFR departure methods, an IFR departure is not authorized (T-2).
      5.5.1.1. Diverse Departure (ICAO - Omnidirectional Departure).
      5.5.1.2. Obstacle Departure Procedure      (ODP).
      5.5.1.3. Standard Instrument Departure (SID).
      5.5.1.4. Specific ATC Departure Instructions.
      5.5.1.5. Non-Standard Takeoff Minimums.
      5.5.1.6. MAJCOM Certified Procedure.
   5.5.2. The following information applies to the departure methods listed above:
40                                                       AFI11-202V3 7 NOVEMBER 2014


     5.5.2.1. Diverse Departure (ICAO - Omnidirectional Departure). A diverse
     departure is an IFR departure procedure used at an airport that has at least one published
     approach but lacks non-standard takeoff minimums and/or IFR departure procedures.
     Track runway centerline to 400 ft. above the DER elevation before turning on course.
     Ensure aircraft will vertically clear applicable low close-in obstacles published in
     NOTAMs or the Takeoff Minima and ODPs               before turning on course. Diverse
     departures are not authorized when an ODP, obstacle climb gradient, or non-standard
     takeoff weather minimums are published for the planned departure runway (T-0).
        5.5.2.1.1. Sector Diverse Departure. Fly “sector” diverse departures as published (T-
        0).
     5.5.2.2. Obstacle Departure Procedures (ODP). Also known as a “trouble T ”,
     ODP refers to textual or graphical instructions to ensure departure obstacle clearance.
     ODPs also include:
        5.5.2.2.1. Visual Climb Over Airport (VCOA). Do not fly any VCOA procedure
        until completion of MAJCOM-specified training. The weather must be at or above
        the minimums published for the VCOA (T-0). Unless otherwise published, consider
        VCOA visibility requirements as the “remain within” distance and do not exceed this
        radius from the center of the airfield while climbing to the specified altitude (T-1).
        Notify ATC (or other traffic) when planning to depart via the VCOA (T-0). Except
        for MAJCOM-approved NVD trained and equipped aircrew, do not fly VCOA
        procedures at night (T-1).
        5.5.2.2.2. Reduced Takeoff Runway Length (RTRL). When using a published RTRL
        procedure ensure the aircraft can attain a safe liftoff speed prior to the distance
        remaining specified in the procedure (T-0). MAJCOM-approved RTRL procedures
        will be considered a published ODP.
     5.5.2.3. Standard Instrument Departures (SID). Follow SID procedures as published
     (T-0). Comply with applicable notes, low close-in obstacles, and climb gradients on the
     SID (T-0). SIDs without a published climb gradient have been assessed at 200 ft/NM. If
     the SID does not have published low close-in obstacles but has an ODP         annotated,
     refer to the corresponding runway ODP for potential low close-in obstacles. Reference all
     published low close-in obstacle locations to ensure compliance.
        5.5.2.3.1. Retrieve RNAV/RNP/GNSS procedures in their entirety by procedure
        name from a current navigation database and compare against approved publications
        (T-0).
     5.5.2.4. Specific ATC Departure Instructions. ATC instructions refer to navigational
     guidance (e.g. heading, routing, and altitude) issued with a departure clearance.
        5.5.2.4.1. If the departure runway has multiple published climb gradients, pilots must
        meet or exceed the highest gradient when departing via ATC instructions (T-0).
        5.5.2.4.2. Outside the NAS in a non-radar environment, confirm minimum climb
        gradient for departure sector (T-0). The obstacle-based climb gradient is not
        standardized at 200 ft/NM outside the NAS.
AFI11-202V3 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                 41


     5.5.2.5. Non-Standard Takeoff Minimums. Departures using non-standard takeoff
     minimums (ceiling and visibility) must ensure the aircraft is at or above the published
     ceiling by the end of the runway (OEI for multi-engine fixed-wing aircraft), then continue
     climbing at 200'/NM (or IAW 5.4.3.1.2.1.) to a minimum IFR altitude (T-1).
        5.5.2.5.1. If the ODP has a non-standard takeoff minimum with a published climb
        gradient, cross the departure end of runway at the published ceiling then comply with
        the published climb gradient (T-1).
     5.5.2.6. MAJCOM Certified Procedure. In Restricted Areas or during contingency
     operations, MAJCOM/A3s may develop and authorize departure procedures for their
     aircraft at specific locations if no other procedure can be developed IAW AFI 11-230,
     Instrument Procedures. Authority may not be further delegated (T-1). Complete
     MAJCOM-specific training before using such procedures.

                                          ENROUTE

6.1. Airspace Clearance Authority.
   6.1.1. Uncontrolled Airspace. The PIC is the clearance authority for IFR or VFR flight in
   uncontrolled airspace (T-0).
   6.1.2. Controlled Airspace.
      6.1.2.1. VFR. The PIC is the clearance authority for VFR flight (if allowed) in
      controlled airspace (T-0). If cancelling an IFR clearance, VFR flight following is not
      required if already in contact with the destination’s control tower.
      6.1.2.2. IFR. Pilots shall obtain ATC clearance before an IFR departure (or as soon as
      practicable after departure while maintaining VMC) or before entering controlled
      airspace (T-0).
6.2. Minimum Aircraft Altitude.
   6.2.1. VFR. In the NAS, fly appropriate VFR hemispheric altitudes when higher than 3,000
   ft. above ground level (AGL), unless authorized by ATC (T-0). Do not apply these altitudes
   when turning or holding in a holding pattern of 2 minutes or less. Outside the NAS, fly
   altitudes or flight levels as specified in FLIP (T-0).
   6.2.2. IFR. Except when necessary for takeoff, landing, or when being vectored by ATC, do
   not fly lower than:
      6.2.2.1. On Airways, no lower than any published minimum for the airway (T-0).
      6.2.2.2. Off Airways, no lower than:
          6.2.2.2.1. The Off Route Obstacle Clearance Altitude (OROCA) (T-0);
          6.2.2.2.2. The Off Route Terrain Clearance Altitude (ORTCA) (T-0); or,
          6.2.2.2.3. An altitude that provides at least 1,000 ft. of clearance above all obstacles
          within 4 NMs of the course to be flown in non-mountainous terrain, or 2,000 ft. in
          mountainous terrain (T-0).
   6.2.3. Other     Minimum       Altitudes. Except       for   MAJCOM-approved           aerial
   demonstrations/events or during takeoff or landing, do not operate aircraft below an altitude
   that, should an emergency landing become necessary, creates undue hazard to persons or
   property.
      6.2.3.1. Military Routes and Special Use Airspace. Adhere to minimum altitudes
      published in FLIP AP for all military routes and special use airspace (e.g., military
      operations area (MOAs), slow speed training routes (SR), IFR military training routes
      (IR), VFR military training routes (VR), controlled firing areas, restricted airspace) (T-0).
      6.2.3.2. Non-congested Areas. Operate over non-congested areas at an altitude at or
      above 500 ft. AGL except over open water, in special use airspace (SUA), or in sparsely
      populated areas (T-0). Under such exceptions, do not operate aircraft closer than 500 ft.
      to any person, vessel, vehicle, or structure (T-0). Helicopters in FAA airspace or
AFI11-202V3 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                        43


       operating IAW host-nation agreements may operate at lower altitudes and in closer
       proximity if they do not create a hazard to persons or property on the surface.
       6.2.3.3. Congested Areas. Operate over congested areas (e.g., cities, towns,
       settlements) or groups of people at an altitude which ensures at least 1,000 ft. above the
       highest obstacle within a 2,000-ft. radius (T-0). Helicopters in FAA airspace or operating
       IAW host-nation agreements may operate at lower altitudes and in closer proximity if
       they do not create a hazard to persons or property on the surface.
       6.2.3.4. Flight over National Recreation Areas and Wildlife Refuges. Operate no less
       than 2,000 ft. AGL (mission permitting) over: National Park Service monuments,
       seashores, lake shores, recreation and scenic riverways; US Fish and Wildlife Service
       refuges; and US Forest Service wilderness and primitive areas (T-0). This paragraph is
       not applicable to SUA, low-altitude tactical navigation areas and MTRs. Specific areas
       may require higher altitudes (see FLIP and sectional aeronautical charts).
       6.2.3.5. Disaster Areas. Do not operate within a designated disaster area unless the
       aircraft is: assisting efforts, specifically cleared by ATC, or flying to or from an airport in
       the area without hampering or endangering relief activities (T-0). Check NOTAMs for
       disaster areas.
6.3. Aircraft Speed.
   6.3.1. Supersonic Flight. Do not operate aircraft at or above Mach l except as specified in
   AFI 13-201. See same guidance if inadvertent flight occurs above Mach 1.
   6.3.2. In the NAS:
       6.3.2.1. Do not exceed 200 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) at or below 2,500 ft. AGL
       within 4 NM of the primary airport in Class C or Class D airspace unless authorized by
       ATC or required to maintain the minimum operating airspeed specified in the aircraft
       T.O. (T-0).
       6.3.2.2. Do not exceed 200 KIAS in the airspace underlying Class B airspace or in a
       VFR corridor designated through Class B airspace unless required to maintain the
       minimum operating airspeed specified in the aircraft T.O. (T-0).
       6.3.2.3. Do not exceed 250 KIAS below 10,000 ft. MSL (T-0). MAJCOMs may approve
       operations exceeding 250 KIAS below 10,000 ft. MSL:
          6.3.2.3.1. Within restricted areas or MOAs.
          6.3.2.3.2. Within DoD/FAA mutually developed instrument routes or DoD
          developed visual routes. (Do not exceed 250 KIAS on slow speed training routes
          (SR)).
          6.3.2.3.3. Within unpublished DoD- and FAA-designated areas or routes. This
          provision is intended to accommodate speed requirements, as necessary to
          accomplish the national defense mission, on an interim basis until the area/route can
          be published.
          6.3.2.3.4. During large-scale exercises or short-term special missions with
          appropriate coordination to ensure awareness of the nonparticipating flying public.
 44                                                      AFI11-202V3 7 NOVEMBER 2014


          6.3.2.3.5. When the aircraft T.O. requires a higher airspeed. If the airspeed in the
          T.O. is listed as a range, fly the slowest practical speed in that range. MAJCOM
          supplements or MDS-specific Volume 3s do not constitute the aircraft T.O.
   6.3.3. Outside the NAS. Do not exceed 250 KIAS below 10,000 ft. MSL unless: in
   international airspace and mission requirements dictate, ICAO/host-nation rules permit, or
   necessary to maintain the minimum safe airspeed in the aircraft T.O. (T-0).
   6.3.4. Holding. Conduct holding at airspeeds prescribed in FLIP or MDS-specific guidance
   (T-0).
6.4. Hazard Avoidance.
   6.4.1. Hazardous Weather. Use all available information to avoid hazardous weather.
      6.4.1.1. “Severe” Conditions. Do not operate in any forecast or actual severe condition
      (e.g. severe icing, turbulence) (T-2). See AFH 11-203 for detailed information.
      6.4.1.2. Thunderstorms. Do not intentionally fly into a thunderstorm (T-2). Damaging
      lightning strikes, electrostatic discharges, and hail encounters can occur in apparently
      benign conditions. Do not fly in IMC in the vicinity of actual thunderstorms without
      operable weather radar (T-2).
   6.4.2. Volcanic Activity. Unless conducting rescue operations, do not operate within 50
   NM of known or reported hazardous volcanic ash (T-2). MAJCOMs may issue guidance on
   operations including procedures for inadvertent ash encounters and avoidance criteria.
      6.4.2.1. Consult an authorized weather source for current Volcanic Ash Advisory Center
      (VAAC) ash cloud information (or significant meteorological information (SIGMET)). If
      unable to contact an authorized weather source consider areas depicted on VAAC charts
      (or SIGMETs) as hazardous. Encounters with volcanic ash will be reported as soon as
      possible to the controlling agency and aircraft maintenance authorities. Report volcanic
      ash encounters to pilot-to-metro service (PMSV) or other weather agencies to ensure
      rapid dissemination (T-0). See PIREP procedures in the FIH.
   6.4.3. Bird Watch Condition (BWC).
      6.4.3.1. BWC MODERATE. Operational commanders will consider restricting
      formation departures, approaches, and pattern work. To increase the chances of seeing
      and avoiding birds, avoid hard turns or excessive climb angles. During BWC Phase II
      periods (see AFI 91-202), accomplish one approach to a full stop unless mission needs
      warrant additional approaches and sufficient fuel exists to divert if BWC changes to
      SEVERE (T-3).
      6.4.3.2. BWC SEVERE. Do not conduct flight operations except in an emergency (T-3).
      Arriving aircraft will either hold awaiting a lower BWC or divert (T-3). Non-emergency
      landings in BWC SEVERE require approval by the operations group commander (or
      designated representative) responsible for airfield flight operations (T-3).
      6.4.3.3. Civil or Foreign Fields. Follow BWC MODERATE procedures if receiving a
      civilian ATC/Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) hazard advisory to use
      caution for birds in the vicinity (T-3).
AFI11-202V3 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                  45


       6.4.3.4. NATO countries may use a numerical system to report BWC (see NATO
       STANAG 3879). Use this intensity conversion: 0-4: low, 5: medium, 6-8: severe. Risk
       warning      updates      for     NW        Europe        are     available      at
       https://www.notams.jcs.mil/common/birdtam.html
6.5. Flight in Extreme Barometric Pressures. If unable to display proper altimeter setting (i.e.
barometric pressure is lower than 28 or higher than 31 inches of mercury), obtain operations
group commander approval for sustained flight in IMC below FL180. See AIM for more
information.
6.6. Flight in Colder Than International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) Temperatures. If the
air temperature at altitude is lower than ISA, true altitude will be lower than indicated by the
barometric altimeter.
   6.6.1. When flying IFR, or VFR at night, over mountainous terrain with the outside air
   temperature (OAT) colder than ISA minus 10°C, plan to fly at least 1,000 ft. above published
   minimum altitudes obtained from terrain and IFR enroute charts (e.g. minimum enroute
   altitudes (MEA), minimum obstruction clearance altitudes (MOCA), OROCAs or other
   minimum safe altitudes during low-levels) (T-1).
6.7. Communications.
   6.7.1. Emergency Frequencies. If suitably equipped, monitor at least one emergency
   frequency at all times as mission and operational conditions permit (T-1). Report distress or
   emergency locator transmitter (ELT) transmissions to ATC (T-0).
6.8. RNAV and RNP Operations.
   6.8.1. Navigation Database Operations.
       6.8.1.1. Do not modify database waypoints or insert user-defined waypoints on RNAV,
       RNP, etc. routes or procedures except to change altitude and/or airspeed to assist in
       complying with an ATC instruction (T-0). Systems which allow additional waypoints on
       the track may be used.
       6.8.1.2. Crosscheck the cleared flight plan against current FLIP, the navigation system
       textual display, and aircraft map display (if applicable) (T-0). Include confirmation of
       waypoint sequence, reasonability of track angles and distances, altitude or speed
       constraints, and identification of fly-by or fly-over waypoints (T-0). Do not execute any
       procedure for which there is doubt about validity of the navigation database or
       publications (T-0).
   6.8.2. Random RNAV in the NAS. Radar monitoring is required on all unpublished
   (random) RNAV routes (T-0). Refer to FLIP GP.
   6.8.3. Published RNAV routes (Q or T routes). If RNAV routes cannot be retrieved from the
   database, selecting and inserting ALL of the named fixes from the database is permitted.
   6.8.4. Use of RNAV Systems on Conventional Routes and Procedures. Suitable RNAV
   systems may be used as a substitute or alternate means of navigation on conventional routes
   and procedures. MAJCOMs reference FAA Advisory Circular (AC) 90-108, Use of Suitable
   Area Navigation (RNAV) Systems on Conventional Routes and Procedures, and provide
   operational guidance. Outside the NAS, comply with host-nation/oceanic procedures (T-0).
 46                                                      AFI11-202V3 7 NOVEMBER 2014


       6.8.4.1. MAJCOMs may approve the use of other RNAV systems (i.e. not “suitable” as
       defined in AC 90-108) to enhance IFR navigation on conventional routes and procedures.
       Underlying conventional NAVAIDS/routes/procedures must be tuned and monitored (T-
       0).
       6.8.4.2. “Alternate means” refers to using a suitable RNAV system in lieu of operable
       conventional NAVAIDS or installed and operable avionics. “Substitute means” refers to
       using a suitable RNAV system in lieu of out-of-service conventional NAVAIDS or non-
       installed/non-operable avionics.
       6.8.4.3. The following uses are prohibited:
          6.8.4.3.1. Substitution for the final approach segment of a VOR/TACAN/NDB
          approach (T-1).
          6.8.4.3.2. Navigation on LOC-based courses (including LOC back-course guidance)
          without monitoring the raw LOC data (T-1).
          6.8.4.3.3. Navigation with DME/DME/IRU systems (without GNSS/WAAS input)
          unless specifically authorized by NOTAM or FAA guidance (T-2).
          6.8.4.3.4. Use of a procedure identified as “NA” without exception by a NOTAM (T-
          0).
       6.8.4.4. Except as prohibited, either substitute or alternate means of navigation may be
       used as follows:
          6.8.4.4.1. Determine position relative to or distance from a VOR, TACAN, NDB,
          compass locator, or DME fix.
          6.8.4.4.2. Determine position relative to or distance from a named fix defined by the
          intersection of a radial/bearing/course of a VOR/LOC/TACAN/NDB/compass
          locator.
          6.8.4.4.3. Navigate to/from a VOR/TACAN/NDB/compass locator.
          6.8.4.4.4. Hold over a VOR/TACAN/NDB/compass locator, or DME fix.
          6.8.4.4.5. Fly an arc based upon DME.
       6.8.4.5. Operating Requirements and Considerations.
          6.8.4.5.1. Retrieve all NAVAIDS, fixes, and procedures from a current navigation
          database (T-0).
          6.8.4.5.2. Tune, identify, monitor, and display the appropriate ground-based
          NAVAIDs whenever practicable (T-0).
          6.8.4.5.3. Notify ATC when substituting for an out-of-service NAVAID (T-0).
6.9. Performance-Based Operations. Performance-based operations may be based on
performance of a combination of navigation, communications, and/or surveillance capabilities
(e.g., Required Navigation Performance (RNP)).
   6.9.1. Do not execute performance-based operations (airspace/routes/procedures) without
   specific approval (T-2). MAJCOMs will publish special conditions or limitations associated
   with each performance-based airspace or procedure.
AFI11-202V3 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                   47


   6.9.2. Follow equipment requirements and/or limitations published in FLIP (T-0).
   6.9.3. Advise ATC if an equipment failure or other malfunction results in the loss of aircraft
   capability to continue operations (T-0).
   6.9.4. When unable to comply with performance-based operations, revise the route or delay
   the operation (T-0).
6.10. Legacy Special Civil Airspace Requirements.
   6.10.1. Minimum       Navigation       Performance       Specifications   (MNPS)
   Airspace. MAJCOMs must provide approval and guidance for operations in MNPS
   Airspace. Comply with applicable FLIP area planning documents (T-0). HQ USAF/A3O,
   through HQ AFFSA/XOF (hqaffsa.xof@us.af.mil), must approve waivers to the
   requirements of North Atlantic Track Minimum Navigation Performance Specifications
   (NAT MNPS) and/or Canadian Minimum Navigation Performance Specifications (CMNPS)
   airspace.
   6.10.2. Reduced Vertical Separation Minimums (RVSM) Airspace. Unless specifically
   cleared by ATC, do not operate in RVSM airspace without functional RVSM equipment (T-
   0). Comply with applicable FLIP area planning documents (T-0). Notify ATC as soon as
   possible if required equipment fails after entering RVSM airspace (T-0).
6.11. VFR Flight. When in FAA airspace, adhere to the weather minimums listed in Table 6.1.
(T-0). When outside of FAA airspace, comply with guidance in FLIP, FCG, or the ICAO VFR
weather minimums depicted in Table 6.2. (T-0). When operating under VFR, aircrews must be
able to control the aircraft by referencing visual cues from a discernible horizon regardless of
cloud clearance requirements (T-0).
   6.11.1. Before transition from IFR to VFR, establish appropriate visibility and cloud
   clearances IAW Table 6.1 or 6.2. (T-0).
   6.11.2. During transition from VFR to IFR, maintain appropriate visibility and cloud
   clearance requirements to a minimum IFR altitude until receipt of the IFR clearance (T-0).

                                         ARRIVAL

7.1. Weather.
   7.1.1. Destination Weather Update. Obtain the latest destination airport conditions prior to
   beginning descent or commencing an approach (T-0).
   7.1.2. Required Approach Minimums. Do not begin a descent if destination weather is
   below the following required approach minimums:
      7.1.2.1. For a straight-in or sidestep approach, the required visibility minimums (T-0).
      7.1.2.2. For a circling approach, both the required ceiling and visibility minimums (T-0).
   7.1.3. Changes to Weather During Arrivals. If the reported weather decreases below
   minimums after starting a descent, receiving radar vectors for an approach, or established on
   any segment of an approach prior to the missed approach point (MAP), the approach may be
   continued to the MAP and either execute a missed approach or continue to land if conditions
   in paragraphs 7.5.2. and 7.5.3. are met.
   7.1.4. Approach or Landing Near Hazardous Weather. Do not fly an approach or land at
   an airport where thunderstorms or other hazardous conditions are producing hail, strong
   winds, gust fronts, heavy rain, lightning, wind shear, or microbursts (T-2).
   7.1.5. Landing Criteria.
      7.1.5.1. Fixed-Wing. MAJCOMs may authorize Category I Instrument Landing System
      (ILS) approaches to less than 2400 RVR at locations without Touchdown
      Zone/Centerline Lighting (TDZ/CL) (or when such system is inoperative) provided the
      approach is flown using guidance from an approved flight director, heads-up display, or
      coupled to an autopilot flown to a Decision Altitude (DA). In addition to MAJCOM
      approval, authorization must be stated on the instrument approach procedure (IAP) or be
      published in the inoperative components or visual aids table of the TPP (T-0).
          7.1.5.1.1. Category I (1800 RVR or greater). Touchdown zone RVR must be equal to
          or greater than the specified minimums on the IAP (T-0).
          7.1.5.1.2. Category II (1200 to less than 1800 RVR). Touchdown zone RVR must be
          equal to or greater than the specified minimums on the IAP (T-0).
          7.1.5.1.3. Category III (RVR less than 1200). Touchdown, midfield, and rollout RVR
          must be equal to or greater than the specified minimums on the IAP (T-0).
          MAJCOMs will publish Category III RVR requirements if applicable.
      7.1.5.2. Helicopter. Category A minimums may be used regardless of approach speed.
      Additionally, visibility minimums may be reduced by one-half, but no lower than 1/4 SM
      PV or 1,200 ft. RVR (T-0). Apply any inoperative approach lighting visibility correction
      before reducing minimums (T-0). Do not reduce the visibility minimums on Copter,
      Category II, Category III, circling procedures, or if “Visibility Reduction by Helicopters
      NA” is annotated on the procedure (T-0). Apply airspeed limitations IAW Table 7.1. (T-
      0).

                                                              are limited to 90 KIAS for all
                                                              segments.

7.2. Cold Weather Altitude Corrections. Add the values derived from the FIH Temperature
Correction Chart to the published procedure altitudes IAW Table 7.2. (T-0). Advise ATC if any
applied correction exceeds 80 ft. (T-1).
   7.2.1. Do not apply a temperature correction to an ATC-assigned altitude (T-0). Radar
   vectoring altitudes assigned by ATC in the NAS are not temperature compensated and may
   be queried or refused if obstacle clearance is in doubt.

7.3. Types of Arrivals.
   7.3.1. Conventional Arrivals. Fly these procedures using the appropriate conventional
   NAVAID(s) as the primary means of navigation except as authorized with approved RNAV
   equipment (T-0); see paragraph 6.9.
   7.3.2. RNAV/RNP/GNSS Arrivals. Retrieve RNAV/RNP/GNSS procedures in their
   entirety by procedure name from a current navigation database and compare against
   approved publications (T-0).
   7.3.3. MAJCOM Certified Procedure. Fly these procedures as authorized by the
   MAJCOM.
7.4. Types of Approaches.
   7.4.1. NDB/VOR/TACAN/ILS Approaches. Fly these procedures using the appropriate
   conventional NAVAID(s) as the primary means of navigation except as authorized with
   approved RNAV equipment (T-0); see paragraph 6.9.
   7.4.2. RNAV/RNP/GNSS Approaches. Retrieve RNAV/RNP/GNSS procedures in their
   entirety by procedure name from a current navigation database and compare against
   approved publications (T-0).
   7.4.3. Self-Contained Approaches (SCA). SCAs are approved for IMC when developed
   by TERPS authority IAW AFI 11-230 and approved for use by the MAJCOM (T-1). When
   unable to develop a procedure IAW AFI 11-230 by a TERPS authority, see paragraph 7.4.6.
   7.4.4. Precision Runway Monitoring (PRM) Approaches. Do not fly PRM approaches
   unless the aircrew and the aircraft are properly certified by the MAJCOM (T-0). If unable to
   accept a PRM approach clearance, contact Air Traffic Control System Command Center at 1-
   800-333-4286 to coordinate an arrival time. Without coordination, expect an ATC-directed
   divert to a non-PRM airport (T-0).
       7.4.4.1. TCAS II equipped aircraft will fly the ILS PRM approach in TA/RA mode (T-
       0).
       7.4.4.2. If an ATC breakout and a TCAS RA are received simultaneously, or shortly
       after one another, turns will be in accordance with ATC breakout instructions while
       vertical corrections will be in accordance with the TCAS system (T-0).
   7.4.5. Authorization Required Procedures. Do not fly any RNP “Authorization
   Required”, conventional “Special Authorization”, or any procedure with a note requiring
   specific authorization without MAJCOM training and operational approval (T-0).
 54                                                        AFI11-202V3 7 NOVEMBER 2014


   7.4.6. MAJCOM Certified Procedure. MAJCOM/A3s may develop and authorize an
   approach procedure for use in IMC for their aircraft. Authority may not be further delegated
   (T-1). Complete MAJCOM-specific training before using such procedures. These procedures
   may be conducted in the NAS (or elsewhere with host-nation agreement):
       7.4.6.1. With ATC approval; or,
       7.4.6.2. In conjunction with a published instrument approach procedure; or,
       7.4.6.3. In SUA; or,
       7.4.6.4. Under VFR.
7.5. Approach Minimums.
   7.5.1. Determining Decision Height (DH)/Decision Altitude (DA)/Minimum Descent
   Altitude (MDA). Determine minimum approach altitudes with the barometric altimeter
   except when directed by MAJCOM or aircraft T.O. guidance.
   7.5.2. Descent Below DH/DA/MDA. Do not descend below DH/DA/MDA until sufficient
   visual reference with the runway environment has been established and in a position to
   execute a safe landing (T-0).
   7.5.3. Descent Below 100 ft. Do not descend below 100 ft. above the threshold elevation
   (THRE) or touchdown zone elevation (TDZE) using the approach lights as a reference unless
   the red termination bars or the red side row bars are visible and identifiable (N/A on CAT III
   approaches) (T-0).
7.6. Inoperative Approach Lighting System (ALS). Unless paragraph 3.16.1. applies, when
the runway ALS (or any portion, but not including sequenced flashers or visual glide slope
indicators) as depicted on the procedure is inoperative, increase the published visibility
minimums of an instrument approach by one of the following:
   7.6.1. As directed by the inoperative components table in the TPP (T-0); or,
   7.6.2. As stated on IAP, NOTAMs, ATIS, or other airport information source (T-0); or,
   7.6.3. If no other guidance is provided, increase published visibility by ½ mile (T-0).
7.7. Landing Gear Reporting Procedures. Retractable gear aircraft will report gear down
status to ATC or runway supervisory unit after extending the landing gear (T-1). This report shall
be made during any approach prior to crossing the runway threshold (T-1).
7.8. Missed Approach.
   7.8.1. Executing the Missed Approach. If at the MAP/DH/DA and not in a position to
   execute a safe landing, immediately execute the appropriate missed approach procedure or
   ATC-issued climbout instructions (T-0). If beyond the MAP/DH/DA, coordinate with ATC
   for climb-out instructions (T-0).
       7.8.1.1. The missed approach procedure should not be initiated until over the
       MAP/DH/DA unless otherwise cleared by ATC (T-0). Climbing prior to the
       MAP/DH/DA is permitted, but ATC should be advised as soon as practical.
AFI11-202V3 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                     55


       7.8.1.2. During an emergency, if unable to comply with the missed approach routing or
       climb requirements, coordinate alternate climbout instructions to ensure obstacle
       clearance.
   7.8.2. Missed Approach Climb Performance. Prior to starting any instrument approach,
   ensure compliance with the following missed approach climb gradients:
       7.8.2.1. Single Engine Aircraft. Climb performance must meet or exceed 200 ft/NM or
       the published missed approach climb gradient, whichever is higher, to an appropriate IFR
       altitude (T-1).
       7.8.2.2. Multi-Engine Fixed-Wing Aircraft. Using thrust available when starting the
       approach (AEO or OEI), ensure the aircraft can meet 200 ft/NM or the published missed
       approach climb gradient, whichever is higher, to an appropriate IFR altitude (T-1).
           7.8.2.2.1. If unable to meet published missed approach climb gradient OEI, and
           operationally necessary, the MAJCOM/A3 may authorize subtraction of up to
           48’/NM from the missed approach climb gradient. This authority may be further
           delegated, but may not be delegated to the respective aircrew for which the waiver
           would apply (T-1).
       7.8.2.3. Helicopter. Climb performance must meet or exceed 200 ft/NM or the
       published missed approach climb gradient, whichever is higher, to an appropriate IFR
       altitude which ensures obstacle clearance or 400 ft/NM for “Copter Only” approaches (T-
       1).
7.9. Land and Hold Short Operations (LAHSO). Fixed-wing pilots are prohibited from
accepting LAHSO clearances (T-1).
   7.9.1. Aircrews may passively participate in LAHSO (land or take-off when another aircraft
   has been given a LAHSO clearance). The PIC is the final authority whether to take-off, land,
   or continue a touch-and-go when a merging aircraft has received a LAHSO clearance.
7.10. Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS). MAJCOMs may approve non-formation
RSRS operations. Host ATC and user units will publish RSRS procedures (T-2). MAJCOM
approval shall include MDS-specific RSRS criteria governing similar and dissimilar
landing/touch-and-go/low approach operations.
7.11. Helicopter Landing Areas. Helicopters may operate from/to other than established
landing areas (e.g., fields, highways, parks) if conducting an operational or training mission. For
training missions, permission must be received to use the area and safeguards must exist to
permit operations without hazard to persons or property (T-3).
7.12. Landing With Hot Armament. MAJCOMs will ensure units publish procedures for
aircraft operations with hot armament.
   7.12.1. Before landing with hot armament or practice munitions at any airfield where such
   procedures are unfamiliar, aircrew must:
       7.12.1.1. Advise the tower of the circumstances (T-0);
       7.12.1.2. Advise transient alert and other appropriate agencies (T-0); and,
       7.12.1.3. Request taxi instructions to a designated safe (de-arm) area (T-0).
 56                                                          AFI11-202V3 7 NOVEMBER 2014


   7.12.2. After landing, aircrew must:
       7.12.2.1. Avoid taxiing into an area that could threaten personnel or equipment (T-0).
       7.12.2.2. Ensure the ground crew is aware of the armament onboard (T-0); and,
       7.12.2.3. Request assistance from the nearest DoD facility, if necessary (T-0).
7.13. Touch-and-Go Landings. MAJCOMs will publish guidance addressing operating
conditions and qualifications.
7.14. Turns after Touch-and-Go or Low Approach. Do not turn after a touch-and-go or low
approach until at least 400 ft. above the DER elevation, at a safe airspeed, and past the end of the
runway (if visible) unless specifically cleared by the controlling agency, required by a published
procedure, or when executing a closed pattern (T-0).
7.15. Traffic Pattern Procedures.
   7.15.1. Fly traffic patterns IAW with control tower instructions, local flying procedures,
   AFMAN 11-217, or FLIP (T-0).
   7.15.2. At airports with no control tower, follow the standard light signals or visual
   indicators that prescribe the direction of traffic and landing runway (T-0).
   7.15.3. Helicopters should avoid the flow of fixed-wing aircraft unless operating at an
   equivalent airspeed.
7.16. Practice Instrument Approaches Under VFR. MAJCOM approval is required to
practice instrument approaches under VFR (T-1). The following restrictions apply:
   7.16.1. Maintain VFR cloud clearances and visibilities IAW Table 6.1 and 6.2 (T-0);
   7.16.2. Use terminal radar service when available (T-1);
   7.16.3. Make all position reports IAW AFMAN 11-217 (T-1); and,
   7.16.4. Request ATC clearance to fly the published missed approach (T-0).
7.17. Night VMC Approaches. Fly the most precise IAP available (T-2).

member as explained in AFPD 11-4, Aviation Service, AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist
Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Aviation Badges, and is assigned to a position listed in AFI
65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning Factors, and is designated on orders to fulfill specific
aeronautical tasks.
Aircrew or Crew—The full complement of military, civilian and contract personnel required to
operate a USAF aircraft and complete an assigned mission.
Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA)—HQ USAF Field Operating Agency charged
with the development, standardization, evaluation and certification of procedures, equipment and
standards to support global flight operations.
Anti-collision Lights—The primary flashing light system on the aircraft intended to attract the
attention of others to enhance sense-and-avoid operations.
AFI11-202V3 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                     65


ASAP—An identity protected, self-reporting system designed to encourage the voluntary
reporting of issues that increase risk to flight operations.
Augmented Aircrew—A basic aircrew supplemented by additional aircrew members to permit
in-flight rest. If the basic aircrew requires only one pilot and a second qualified pilot (includes
pilots enrolled in an AETC formal aircrew training course) is designated an aircrew member to
augment pilot duties, the crew can be considered augmented.
Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast—A system of two avionics components
consisting of a GPS and a transponder (usually Mode S) which will replace radar as the primary
surveillance method worldwide. ADS-B consists of two different services: “ADS-B Out”
transmits aircraft position to ATC and other aircraft, and “ADS-B In” which receives position of
other aircraft and may include separation applications.
Basic Aircrew—Aircrew positions as defined in the aircraft T.O. (or MDS-specific AFI) for the
normal operation of the aircraft or mission.
Civil Twilight—Evening Civil Twilight is the period that begins at sunset and ends in the
evening when the center of the sun’s disk is 6 degrees below the horizon. Morning Civil Twilight
begins prior to sunrise when the center of the sun’s disk is 6 degrees below the horizon, and ends
at sunrise. Use an authorized weather source, the latest version of the Air Almanac, MAJCOM-
approved computer program, or US Naval Observatory data to determine and calculate sun and
moon data. Both periods of twilight are considered “day”, unless further restricted by the
MAJCOM.
Critical Phase of Flight—In the absence of MAJCOM guidance, this term should include:
terminal area operations including taxi, takeoff and landing, low-level flight, air refueling,
airdrop, weapons employment, flight using NVDs, tactical/air combat and formation operations
(other than cruise), and all portions of any test or functional check flight or any aerial
demonstration.
Day—The time between the beginning of morning civil twilight and the end of evening civil
twilight, as published in the Air Almanac.
Decision Altitude (DA) / Decision Height (DH)—A specified altitude during a precision
approach at which a decision must be made to either continue the approach if the pilot acquires
the required visual references, or immediately executes a missed approach. Decision Altitude is
referenced to mean sea level and Decision Height is referenced to the threshold elevation.
Emergency Fuel—The point at which it is necessary to proceed directly to the airport of
intended landing due to low fuel. Declaration of “emergency fuel” is an explicit statement that
priority handling by ATC is both required and expected.
FAA Exemption or Authorization—An official written FAA document which provides the
petitioner relief from specified parts of the CFRs.
Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE)—A RAIM algorithm that can automatically detect and
exclude a faulty satellite from the position solution when a sufficient number of redundant
satellite measurements are available.
Flight Management Computer (FMC) / Flight Management System (FMS)—An on-board
computer system that automates a wide variety of in-flight tasks, to include flight plan
management, multi-sensor navigation, aircraft guidance, and performance management.
 66                                                          AFI11-202V3 7 NOVEMBER 2014


Formation Flight—More than one aircraft which, by prior arrangement between the pilots,
operates as a single aircraft with regard to navigation and position reporting. Separation between
aircraft within the formation is the responsibility of the flight leader and the pilots of the other
aircraft in the flight. This includes transition periods when aircraft within the formation are
maneuvering to attain separation from each other to effect individual control and during join-up
and breakaway. Such a group is treated for ATC purposes as a single aircraft.
Fuel Reserve—The amount of usable fuel that must be carried on each aircraft beyond that
required to complete the flight as planned.
Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)—A generic term for satellite-based navigation,
including GPS, SBAS/WAAS, and any other satellite navigation or augmentation system
suitable for aviation use.
Global Positioning System (GPS)—The United States satellite-based radio navigation system
that provides a global positioning, navigation, and timing service.
Ground Control Element—Comprises the UAS ground control station, power generation units,
communications infrastructure and antenna arrays.
ICAO—The International Civil Aviation Organization (a UN Specialized Agency),
headquartered in Montreal, Canada, is the global forum for civil aviation that works to achieve
its vision of safe, secure, and sustainable development of civil aviation through cooperation
amongst its member States. Promotes understanding and security through cooperative aviation
regulation.
Inertial Navigation System (INS)—A self-contained dead reckoning system that senses
acceleration along the three axes of the aircraft and calculates the distance traveled from a
reference point. Accuracy of the system decreases with time.
Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC)—Ceiling, visibility, and cloud clearances that
do not meet the criteria for VMC.
Land and Hold Short Operations (LAHSO)—Procedures developed to expedite traffic flow at
civil and joint-use airports needing additional tools to increase capacity. Allows civilian aircraft
to operate on intersecting runways simultaneously.
Lateral Navigation (LNAV)—RNAV non-precision approach providing lateral guidance.
Low Close-in Obstacles—Those obstacles within the Initial Climb Area that require an
excessive climb gradient to a climb-to-altitude of 200 ft. or less above the Departure End of
Runway elevation or alternate takeoff weather minimums. These obstacles are published in
NOTAMs, on the SID chart, or in the IFR Take-off Minimums and (Obstacle) Departure
Procedures section of the terminal procedure booklet. Typical chart notation is: “NOTE: Rwy
17L, tree 5610' from DER, 212' left of centerline, 82' AGL/2723' MSL.”
Minimum Fuel—Indicates that an aircraft's fuel supply has reached a state where, upon reaching
the destination, it can accept little or no delay. This is not an emergency situation but merely
indicates an emergency situation is possible should any undue delay occur.
Minimum Navigation Performance Specification (MNPS)—Implemented in the North
Atlantic region between FL285-420 and specifies a number of equipment, training, and
procedural requirements. MNPS navigation accuracy is equivalent to RNP 12.6. Dual long-range
AFI11-202V3 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                     67


navigation systems (LRNS) and dual long-range communication systems are required. RVSM is
mandatory in MNPS airspace. Aircraft that cannot meet dual LRNS requirements may be
accommodated on special routings ("Blue Spruce" routes). Aircraft that cannot meet RVSM
requirements are excluded from MNPS airspace unless operating on an ALTRV.
Mode 4—Transponder mode established to enable IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) functions
between military aircraft or military aircraft and military ground stations. Uses classified codes,
but operates on 1030 MHz and 1090 MHz; the same frequency pair used by the Air Traffic
Control Radar Beacon System that civil air traffic uses for Mode 3A/C, Mode S, and TCAS.
Mode 4 interrogation signals can suppress civil airborne transponders; therefore all Mode 4
operations in the NAS require prior authorization through the Air Force Frequency Management
Agency (AFFMA): affma.cc@pentagon.af.mil.
Mode 5—Performance upgrade to the current Mark XII IFF transponder system. Mode 5
provides new waveforms, new cryptography, more data, and improved radio frequency (RF) link
margin to resolve many of the deficiencies identified with Mark XII. It will eventually replace
the analog Mode 4 IFF system with digital IFF message formats which embed unprecedented
combat relevant data.
Mode S—The primary role of the Mode S transponder is to "selectively" respond to
interrogations, as opposed to responding to all interrogations, from a ground sensor or TCAS to
provide airborne data information including identification, equipage, and altitude.
Mountainous Terrain—In the absence of other MAJCOM guidance, USAF aircrews shall
consider as mountainous those areas defined in 14 CFR §95.11 for CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii and
Puerto Rico. In other areas, use 500 ft. surface elevation change over a ½ NM.
National Airspace System (NAS)—The NAS is the common network of United States (U.S.)
airspace: air navigation facilities, equipment, services, airports or landing areas, aeronautical
charts, information/services, rules, regulations, procedures, technical information, manpower,
and material. Included are system components shared jointly with the military. United States, in
a geographical sense, means (1) the States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the
possessions, including the territorial waters (within 12 nautical miles) and (2) the airspace of
those areas. Note: IAW ICAO Article 12 and Annex 2 and 11, the United States has accepted
responsibility for providing air traffic services within airspace overlying the high seas beyond 12
miles from the coast (also known as international airspace). These flight information regions of
international airspace include: Oakland Oceanic, Anchorage Oceanic, Anchorage Continental,
Anchorage Arctic, Miami Oceanic, Houston Oceanic and New York Oceanic. Aircrews should
be aware that although they are being provided air traffic services by the FAA, they are operating
in international airspace and ICAO SARPS, FLIP, and AFIs are applicable.
Navigation Specification—A set of aircraft and aircrew requirements needed to support
performance-based navigation operations within a defined airspace. Comprised of RNAV and
RNP specifications.
Night—The time between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil
twilight, as published in the Air Almanac.
Non-Standard Formation—Operations under any of the following conditions: 1. When the
flight leader has requested and ATC has approved other than standard formation dimensions (≤1
NM lateral separation or ≤ 100 ft. vertical separation), 2. When operating within an authorized
 68                                                          AFI11-202V3 7 NOVEMBER 2014


altitude reservation (ALTRV) or under the provisions of a letter of agreement, 3. When
operations are conducted in airspace specifically designed for a special activity.
OROCA—An off-route altitude which provides obstruction clearance with a 1,000 ft. buffer in
non-mountainous terrain areas and a 2,000 ft. buffer in designated mountainous areas within the
United States. This altitude may not provide signal coverage from ground-based navigational
aids, air traffic control radar, or communications coverage.
ORTCA—An off-route altitude that provides terrain clearance with a 3,000 ft. buffer from
terrain. This altitude may not provide signal coverage from ground-based navigational aids, air
traffic control radar, or communications coverage. This altitude is used on en route charts
covering those areas outside the United States.
P-Airfield—Civil airport that permits use by transient military aircraft.
Passenger—An individual onboard the aircraft who is not on the flight authorization. See AFI
11-401 for further guidance.
Performance-Based Operations (PBO)—Operations based on stated aircraft and aircrew
performance requirements addressing communications, navigation, and surveillance systems.
Portable Electronic Devices (PEDs)—Portable electronic devices which are not installed on an
aircraft as standard equipment. PEDs may include temporary mounts, a data interface, an
external antenna, and may require aircraft electrical power.
Precise Positioning Service (PPS)—GPS service available to authorized users via the encrypted
P(Y) code ranging signal. PPS can offer greater accuracy and resistance to jamming and
spoofing.
Predictive RAIM (P-RAIM)—Using a standard set of algorithms, the availability of RAIM
may be determined based on the satellite coverage expected at an aircraft’s ETA. Due to terrain
masking and other factors (e.g., satellite fails after RAIM prediction made), P-RAIM does not
guarantee there will be sufficient satellite coverage on arrival. P-RAIM does not have to reside in
the GPS receiver. It can be provided by FAA Flight Service (US NAS only) and other ground-
based RAIM algorithms.
Prevailing Visibility (PV)—The greatest horizontal visibility observed throughout at least half
of the horizon circle. It need not be continuous throughout 180 consecutive degrees.
Primary Flight Reference (PFR)—Any display or suite of displays and instruments used to
present the basic flight information needed for immediate control of the aircraft. PFR includes
attitude (climb/dive angle or pitch and vertical velocity, bank angle, and a prominent horizon
reference), indicated or calibrated airspeed, barometric altitude, heading, appropriate fault
indications, and the capability to recognize and recover from an unusual attitude. UAS PFR
includes link status, flight guidance mode, and logic.
PRM Approach—An instrument landing system (ILS) approach conducted to parallel runways
whose extended centerlines are separated by less than 4,300 ft. and the parallel runways have a
PRM system that permits simultaneous independent ILS approaches.
Procedures for Air Navigation Services-Aircraft Operations (PANS-OPS)—ICAO
documents detailing specific procedures for the safety of air traffic navigation agreed to by
ICAO signatories.
AFI11-202V3 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                   69


Radar Required—This note on an instrument procedure indicates aircraft using the procedure
will be monitored by ATC radar during a particular phase of flight or throughout the entire
procedure, as applicable. Coordination with air traffic is necessary to ensure ATC capability and
agreement to provide these services before adding the note to any instrument procedure.
Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM)—An algorithm that verifies the integrity
of the position output using redundant GPS measurements, or using GPS measurements and
barometric aiding. An algorithm that uses additional information (e.g., multi-sensor system with
inertial reference system) to verify the integrity of the position output may be acceptable as a
RAIM-equivalent.
Reduced Same Runway Separation—Allows reduction of the normal ATC aircraft separation
standards during landings and touch-and-goes and restricted low approach operations to increase
the airport/runway capacity.
Reduced Takeoff Runway Length Procedure (RTRL)—Method used by TERPS to reduce
high IFR climb gradients by shortening the available takeoff runway, thus increasing the distance
to the obstacle, spot elevation, or terrain feature. Normally printed in the IAP      section as:
“…or alternatively, w/ standard takeoff minimums and a normal 200'/NM climb gradient, takeoff
must occur no later than 2200' prior to departure end of runway.” Aircrews are not permitted to
compute climb gradients in this manner.
Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM)—Reduces the vertical separation between
properly equipped and certified aircraft to 1000 ft. in special qualification airspace, normally
between FL290-410 inclusive.
Remotely Piloted Aircraft—The aircraft portion of an unmanned aircraft system.
Remote/Island Destination—In the absence of more restrictive MAJCOM guidance, pilots will
consider a remote/island destination as any aerodrome that, due to its unique geographic
location, offers no suitable alternate within two hours flying time.
RNAV (Area Navigation) Specification—A navigation specification based on RNAV that does
not include the requirement for on-board performance monitoring and alerting, designated by the
prefix RNAV (e.g., RNAV 5, RNAV 1).
RNAV (Area Navigation) System—A navigation system which permits operation on any
desired flight path within the coverage of ground-based, space-based, or self-contained
navigation aids, or a combination of these.
RNP (Required Navigation Performance) Specification—A navigation specification based on
RNAV that includes the requirement for on-board performance monitoring and alerting,
designated by the prefix RNP (e.g., RNP 4, RNP APCH).
RNP (Required Navigation Performance) System—An RNAV system which supports on-
board performance monitoring and alerting.
Runway Environment—The runway environment consists of one or more of the following
elements: The approach light system (except that the pilot may not descend below 100 ft. above
the Touch Down Zone Elevation using the approach lights as a reference unless the red
termination bars or the red side row bars are also visible and identifiable), the threshold,
threshold markings or threshold lights, the runway end identifier lights, the touchdown zone

lights, the runway or runway markings, the runway lights, the visual approach slope indicator.
For more information refer to AFMAN 11-217.
Runway Visual Range (RVR)—The maximum distance in the direction of takeoff or landing at
which the runway, or the specified lights or markers delineating it, can be seen from a position
above a specified point on its center line at a height corresponding to the average eye-level of
pilots at touch down. This value is normally determined by instruments located alongside and
about 14 ft. above the runway and calibrated with reference to the high-intensity runway lights.
Satellite Based Augmentation System (SBAS)—Generic term for a wide coverage
augmentation system to GNSS that calculates integrity and correction data on the ground and
uses geostationary satellites to broadcast the data to SBAS users.
Self-Contained Approach—An arrival procedure, normally from an IFR altitude, to a runway,
using only navigational equipment onboard the aircraft (GPS, radar, or other sensors).
Single Medium Display—A single medium display is a Head-Up Display (HUD), Head-Down
Display (HDD), or Helmet-Mounted Display (HMD) presenting flight instrumentation on a
single display such as a HUD combiner, a “glass” multifunction display, or a helmet visor.
Special Departure Procedure (SDP)—A procedure designed to allow a safe takeoff for multi-
engine aircraft whose OEI climb rate would otherwise not meet the TERPS minimum climb
gradient requirement. The runway and all known obstacles along a chosen takeoff path are
analyzed and compared to the aircraft OEI takeoff and climb performance. The procedure
provides a maximum allowable takeoff gross weight for given environmental conditions that
ensure vertical and lateral obstacle clearance safety margins. The minimum allowable gross and
net climb gradients for SDPs are typically lower than TERPS standards. Unlike TERPS, the
takeoff path is selected to minimize obstacle clearance requirements and only those obstacles
within the lateral limits of the chosen flight path are considered. Pilots should understand that
most SDPs allow exactly zero feet of clearance between their aircraft and the offending
obstacles, and provide no safety factor for pilot technique, less than 100% engine thrust, etc. The
term SDP encompasses both the use of the textual obstacle data table information and the
graphical departure procedures.
Standard Formation—A formation in which no participating aircraft is more than 1 NM
horizontally and 100 ft. vertically from the lead aircraft.
Standard Positioning Service (SPS)—GPS service available to all users via the course/
acquisition (C/A) code ranging signal.
Stopover Flight—A flight where intermediate stops are planned en route to a final destination.
Strobe Lights—Systems such as wingtip strobes or other similar strobe light installations.
Tactical Operations—Flight operations consisting of maneuvers that are unique to the
employment of air power to: gain and maintain air superiority, prevent freedom of operation for
the enemy in the objective area, and to assist naval and ground forces in the attainment of their
objectives. Tactical operations must be specifically MAJCOM (or CCMD) defined, approved
and implemented. These operations are normally practiced only on training or exercise missions,
in a form of special use airspace or on designated training ranges or routes.
Terminal Area Operations—Terminal area operations are normally those flight phases
conducted within 30 NM of an airfield of intended departure or landing, or those operations on

charted Standard Instrument Departures, on charted Standard Terminal Arrivals (STARs), or
other flight operations between the last enroute fix/waypoint and an initial approach
fix/waypoint.
Terrain Alert Warning System (TAWS)—Generic term for any on-board system taking inputs
from terrain databases, radar altimeter, aircraft position sensors, etc. to activate a Ground
Proximity Warning System or Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System (AGCAS).
Developed to help prevent Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) mishaps.
Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS)—An airborne system that functions
independently of the ground-based radar to provide collision avoidance protection between
suitably equipped aircraft. TCAS I provides proximity warnings to pilots in the form of traffic
advisories. TCAS II provides both traffic advisories and recommended vertical escape
maneuvers, known as resolution advisories.
Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS)—Includes one or more control stations, one or more
unmanned aircraft, aircraft control and payload datalinks, and mission payloads, designed or
modified not to carry a human pilot and operated through remote or self-contained autonomous
control. A UAS must meet all applicable requirements of a manned aircraft unless specifically
exempted. The term RPA is specific to the Remotely Piloted Aircraft (the flying portion of the
UAS).
Unmonitored Navigational Aid—Most NAVAIDs have internal monitoring systems that
provide automatic shutdown or notification when a malfunction occurs. Unmonitored NAVAIDs
lack the ability to immediately notify ATC when a malfunction occurs. The pilot may still use
the NAVAID for all types of navigation, including instrument approaches, but must monitor the
NAVAID for a loss of identification since no prior warning of operation may be available from
ATC.
Vertical Navigation (VNAV)—A term that describes using GPS lateral and vertical guidance to
define the minimums for a GPS non-precision or precision approach.
VFR-on-Top—ATC authorization for an IFR aircraft to operate in VFR conditions at any
appropriate VFR altitude (as specified in FLIP and as restricted by ATC). A pilot receiving this
authorization must comply with VFR visibility, distance from cloud criteria, and minimum IFR
altitudes.
VFR-over-the-Top—VFR flight maneuver during which an aircraft on a VFR flight plan climbs
over a ceiling in VMC, maintains VMC above the clouds, then descends in VMC and lands.
Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC)—Meteorological conditions in which visual flight
rules may be used; expressed in terms of visibility, ceiling height, and aircraft clearance from
clouds along the path of flight. When these criteria do not exist, instrument meteorological
conditions prevail and instrument flight rules (IFR) must be followed.
WGS-84—World Geodetic Survey-1984: Developed by the U.S. for world mapping, WGS 84 is
an earth fixed global reference frame. It is the ICAO standard.
Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS)—The U.S. implementation of SBAS which
augments GPS SPS.
