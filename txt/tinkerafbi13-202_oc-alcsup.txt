               VEHICLE OPERATING PROCEDURES ON THE AIRFIELD

3.1. Airfield Diagram. Attachments 7 thru 8 depict the following items:
   3.1.1. Controlled Movement Area (CMA).
   3.1.2. Mandatory Radio Monitor Area (MRMA).
   3.1.3. Airfield access points.
   3.1.4. Restricted area boundaries/entry control points and controlled area boundary.
   3.1.5. Vehicle traffic lanes.
   3.1.6. ILS Glide Slope critical area boundaries.
3.2. Procedures for Gaining Access to the Airfield MRMA and CMA. All personnel
driving/working on the airfield will receive training, a briefing or a qualified escort prior to entry
on the airfield.
   3.2.1. Mandatory Radio Monitor Area (MRMA). The MRMA is outlined in Attachment 7
   and is the area inside the airfield perimeter fence excluding ramp areas and the Controlled
   Movement Area (CMA). All vehicles operating in the MRMA shall be two-way radio
   equipped and capable to communicate with the control tower. Vehicle operators shall
   monitor the control tower frequency at all times in the MRMA and shall respond
   immediately to control tower instructions. Vehicle operators shall request a radio check with
   the control tower, AM OPS, or another vehicle prior to entering the MRMA to ensure their
   radio is operating. No vehicle will operate in the MRMA unless the vehicle operator is
   airfield driver qualified and vehicle is equipped with an operable two-way radio or escorted
   by another vehicle that has operable radio capable to communicate with the control tower.
   3.2.2. Controlled Movement Area (CMA). The CMA is outlined in Attachment 7 and is the
   runway environment area outlined by runway hold short lines (200 ft from runway edge),
   overruns, ILS glideslope and localizer critical areas and portions of runway clear zones.
       3.2.2.1. Airfield drivers must request and receive permission from Tinker Tower
       Controller to enter the CMA. Using telephones or cell phones to communicate with the
       Control tower is prohibited. Permission cannot be relayed through another vehicle or
       dispatcher. While in the CMA, personnel must maintain direct two-way radio
       communications with Tinker Tower Controller and monitor the ramp net frequency or
       channel at all times. Personnel must inform Tinker Tower Controller when exiting the
       CMA.
       3.2.2.2. For multiple vehicle operations, such as snow removal, barrier maintenance,
       maintenance and/or construction crews, etc., at least one airfield driving qualified person
       shall maintain radio contact with Tinker Ground and accept responsibility for controlling
       all vehicles/personnel under their supervision.
   3.2.3. Base agencies that operate in the MRMA/CMA shall obtain a sufficient number of
   radios programmed for the AM OPS radio frequency with the selective call feature “channel
   guard” capability. Radios must be programmed by the base land mobile radio (LMR) office
18                                     TINKERAFBI13-202_OC-ALCSUP_I 1 APRIL 2014


  to provide this capability. This will require two different radio channel numbers on the radio.
  One channel number will be designated for “channel guard”; one-way communication with
  the Tinker Control Tower (receive only) and two-way communication with all other agencies
  on AM OPS radio frequency. The second channel allows two-way communication with
  Tinker Control Tower. Vehicle operators will use the “channel guard” when conducting
  routine transmissions with agencies other than Tinker Control Tower. This reduces the
  amount of chatter on the AM OPS radio frequency and allows Tinker Control Tower to make
  essential traffic calls. Vehicle operators must switch from channel guard to the second
  programmed channel in order to communicate with Tinker Control Tower.
  3.2.4. Short duration, non-recurring requirement (not to exceed seven days) may be satisfied
  by obtaining portable radios from AM OPS when available. Portable radios issued by AM
  OPS will be for a maximum of one day. Radio recipients must be airfield driving certified
  and receive radio/airfield refresher briefings every 90 days. AM OPS personnel will provide
  these refresher briefings and a record will be kept. Upon turn-in, the radio condition and
  operation will be checked. If a radio does not operate correctly, the hand receipt will not be
  released, and AM will have the radio inspected for abuse.
  3.2.5. Contractors requiring access to the airdrome for more than seven days must provide
  their own portable radios with access to communication on AM OPS radio frequency.
  3.2.6. Radio operators shall acknowledge and respond to Tinker Ground Control instructions
  in a timely manner. In the event of radio failure by vehicle or Tinker Control Tower, AM
  OPS will be notified by Tinker Control Tower to respond to the airfield to escort vehicle(s)
  off the MRMA/CMA.
  3.2.7. If relaying is unsuccessful, point vehicle at Tinker Control Tower and flash your
  lights. Tinker Control Tower will give instructions via light gun signals (see paragraph 3.14.
  and Attachment 9-1). Reposition vehicle to a safe distance/location from the MRMA/CMA.
  3.2.8. If loss of radio contact occurs while vehicle is in the CMA, the operator shall
  immediately exit the CMA, hold short of all other runways and reposition vehicle to a safe
  distance/location from the CMA.
  3.2.9. If Tinker Control Tower cannot communicate with a vehicle and the vehicle operator
  is unaware of this situation, the control tower will raise and lower the intensity of the runway
  lights. At this point the vehicle should exit the runway, hold short of all       runways and
  reposition to a safe distance/location from the MRMA and CMA.
  3.2.10. Tinker Control Tower will immediately notify AM OPS when unable to
  communicate with a vehicle in the MRMA/CMA. AM OPS shall respond to the scene to
  take action to remove vehicle from MRMA and CMA.
  3.2.11. When communicating on the radio about vehicle operations on the CMA, use the
      word “OFF” instead of the word “CLEAR.” EXAMPLE: “Tinker Ground, Ops-27, ‘off’
  runway 17 at taxiway Charlie.” The word “clear” shall not be used by personnel
      operating vehicles operating on the airfield.
  3.2.12. Vehicles operating in the MRMA, CMA and ALL RAMPS shall be equipped with a
  roof-mounted rotating amber beacon or four-way hazard/warning flashers, which shall be
  turned on while in the MRMA and CMA. Fire Department vehicles are exempt from this
TINKERAFBI13-202_OC-ALCSUP_I 1 APRIL 2014                                                      19


   requirement. Rotating beacon requirements are: 55-watt halogen bulb rated at 30,000
   candlepower and a rotation rate of at least 90 cycles per minute. Vehicles responding to an
   emergency shall have roof-mounted red or amber flashing lights and/or rotating beacon.
   3.2.13. Vehicular Call Signs. The Airfield Manager will approve and publish vehicle call
   signs for recurring vehicle operations in the CMA/MRMA to ensure duplicate call signs are
   not used. Agencies that require recurring vehicle operations in the CMA/MRMA (i.e. Fire
   Department, Civil Engineers, Aircraft Maintenance, Security Force, etc.) will notify the
   Airfield Manager for assignment/approval of vehicle call signs. Approved vehicle call signs
   listed in Attachment 12. A complete copy of the vehicle call sign list shall be kept in AM
   OPS and the Control Tower.
   3.2.14. Runway Crossing Procedures. Runway crossings must be limited to the absolute
       minimum to accomplish mission requirements. All vehicle operators/pedestrians shall
   stop 200’ prior to any runway, at the runway hold line marking and mandatory hold sign, as
   appropriate, and obtain radio approval from Tinker Ground Control to cross or enter a
   runway. After receiving approval, personnel shall verbally acknowledge (“read-back”) the
   approval and visually scan the runway and both final approaches prior to entering or
   crossing. If hold short instructions are issued, vehicle operators shall acknowledge and “read-
   back” hold short instructions. Operators/pedestrians shall advise Tinker Ground Control
   when off the runway after crossing the runway and past the hold line marking/hold sign.
   3.2.15. Airfield drivers will stop and hold at INST hold lines/signs. Drivers will request
   permission from Tinker Ground Control to proceed inside the INST hold lines/sign
   boundaries.
   3.2.16. The requirement to obtain radio approval is applicable when going “around the horn”
   from one taxiway to another by passing through the multiple intersection at TWY C, H and
   K, north of RWY 12/30.
   3.2.17. All vehicles operating on any runway will obtain radio approval from Tinker Ground
   Control to cross another runway regardless of runway in use. The requirement to obtain
   radio approval does not change for a closed runway.
   3.2.18. Runway crossing may be approved by Tinker Ground Control only at
   taxiway/runway intersections. EXCEPTION: Barrier Maintenance, Fire Department and AM
   OPS may be authorized to enter/cross runways at barrier/cable locations.
3.3. Restricted Areas/Controlled Area. Access to airfield controlled and restricted areas will
be in accordance with Base Supplement to AFI 31-209, TAFB Plan 31-209, and OC-ALC
TAFBI 31-101. See Attachment 7-3 for depiction of Controlled and Restricted Areas.

       A2.4.5.7. If escorting another vehicle, discuss route to be taken with the other driver.
       Remain together until mission is complete and off the airfield.
       A2.4.5.8. When exiting the CMA, notify Ground Control with location of exit point.
       A2.4.5.9. Vehicle Breakdown. If for any reason the vehicle fails to operate under its
       own power while in the MRMA and CMA, immediately contact Ground Control of the
       nature of the problem and your position on the airfield. Ground Control will then contact
       appropriate personnel and reroute any taxiing aircraft.
   A2.4.6. Procedures for proper radio terminology/phraseology and discipline. Refer to
   Training Guide and this instruction.
       A2.4.6.1. Make clear and concise radio transmissions and use proper radio terminology.
       Do not use “10” code/series phraseology.
       A2.4.6.2. Ensure Tinker Ground’s instructions are understood and followed. Read back
       “hold-short” instructions received from Tinker Ground.
       A2.4.6.3. After making a request to Tinker Ground, make sure the next transmission
       from Tinker Ground is yours – listen for your call sign. Tinker Ground is in
       communications with other vehicles and aircraft, don’t assume the next radio
       transmission is yours.
       A2.4.6.4. Ensure the radio frequency is open before making a transmission – do not
       interrupt another radio transmission. Maintain good radio etiquette.
       A2.4.6.5. Radios must be programmed by base LMR office to provide the selective call
       feature “channel guard” capability. This will require two separate programmed channel
       numbers on the radio. One channel number will be designated for “channel guard”; one-
       way communication with the Control Tower (receive only) and two-way communication
       with all other agencies on AM Operations radio frequency. The second channel allows
       two-way communication with the Control Tower. Vehicle operators will use the
       “channel guard” when conducting routine transmissions with agencies other than the
TINKERAFBI13-202_OC-ALCSUP_I 1 APRIL 2014                                                  45


     Control Tower. This reduces the amount of chatter on the AM OPS radio frequency and
     allows Control Tower to make essential traffic calls. Vehicle operators must switch from
     channel guard to the second programmed channel in order to contact the Control Tower.
     A2.4.6.6. When in doubt, ask for a repeat of Tinker Ground’s instructions.
     A2.4.6.7. Vehicles with radios can escort vehicles without radios. When escorting,
     vehicles must remain together at all times in the MRMA and CMA.
     A2.4.6.8. Do not use the words “CLEAR” or “CLEARANCE.” These words are part of
     Air Traffic Control terminology. It may also cause another driver to mistake the radio
     transmission for his/her authorization. Example:
              “Tinker Ground, Ops-29, Off Runway 17 at Taxiway Charlie.”
     A2.4.6.9. Radio Communications in the CMA will be closely monitored by Airfield
     Operations. Individuals failing to use proper communications with the control tower will
     be checked by AM OPS. Proper communication includes using vehicle call signs on
     each and every transmission, repeating hold short instructions, monitoring the radio and
     responding to radio calls promptly.
  A2.4.7. Speed Limits for vehicle parking areas/aircraft parking ramps/flightline access
  roads/taxiways/runways/towing operations. General purpose vehicle: 15 MPH; Special
  purpose: 10 MPH; EXCEPTION: Normal vehicle speed limit on the runway during non-
  emergency operations will be 30 MPH or as necessary to expedite exit at Control Tower
  direction. Speed limits for all emergency response vehicles responding to bona fide
  emergency situations will be a speed that is necessary to respond expeditiously and safely.
  No vehicle will operate in excess of 5 MPH when near aircraft. No vehicle will operate at a
  speed in excess of that deemed reasonable and prudent for existing traffic, road and weather
  conditions. If Ground Control, AM personnel, unit driving program manager, commander or
  anyone else on the airfield takes notice of your speed, then you are speeding. Normally, a
  warning via the radio will be issued unless driver is using unusually excess speeds. If the
  warning is not followed then you will be instructed to either hold your position until AM
  responds or report to AM Operations.
  A2.4.8. Identifying Airfield Marking and Signs and Night and inclement weather driving
  instructions, to include requirements to stop at “INST” holding positions.
     A2.4.8.1. Of primary concern are the HOLD SHORT LINE markings. The lines mark
     the boundary of the runway. Look for multiple yellow lines on a black background 200
     feet from the runway edge. DO NOT CROSS this line without authorization from
     Ground Control.
     A2.4.8.2. Co-located with the painted HOLD SHORT LINE marking is the RUNWAY
     HOLD POSITION SIGN, located to the left side of taxiway/runway boundary. This sign
     is on a red background with white numbers and is lighted for night/inclement weather
     operations.
     A2.4.8.3. Boundaries for the Instrument Land System (ILS) areas are marked by
     INSTRUMENT (INST) HOLD LINES. When personnel or equipment are within the
     ILS area it could seriously degrade the ILS performance. INST Hold Lines are painted
     with multiple yellow lines on a black background. Drivers will stop at INST Hold Lines
46                                   TINKERAFBI13-202_OC-ALCSUP_I 1 APRIL 2014


     and request permission from Tinker Ground to proceed across. CAUTION: Permission to
     proceed across an INST Hold Lines is not authorization to cross a normal HOLD SHORT
     LINE.
     A2.4.8.4. Co-located with the painted INST HOLD LINE marking is the INST HOLD
     LINE SIGN. This sign, located to the left of the INST hold line, has a red background
     with the letters ILS in white. The INST sign is illuminated for nighttime and inclement
     weather operations. Roadways that enter an ILS critical area have unlit signs warning
     vehicle operators not to proceed without approval from Control Tower.
     A2.4.8.5. Airfield Information and Guidance signs are black and yellow display panels
     located at A2.intersecting pavement areas. They define location, direction and
     designation of taxiways.
     A2.4.8.6. Taxiway line markings are used as guides for taxiing aircraft. Vehicles will
     use the markings as a road divider.
     A2.4.8.7. Night and Inclement Weather Driving.
         A2.4.8.7.1. The airfield environment at night is different than the day. The night
         environment may not be as busy but can be more hazardous due to impaired vision
         caused by the darkness and the confusion caused by the various lights on the airfield.
         When driving at night, use more caution.
         A2.4.8.7.2. Aircraft have the right of way on the airfield. Do not shine your vehicle
         headlights towards a moving aircraft. Turn vehicle headlights off, but always keep
         the four-way flashers or beacon on. Turning off headlights prevents temporary
         blindness in the pilot or tow operator. Leaving flashers or beacon operating lets the
         pilot/tow operator and Ground Control know your location at all times. Vehicles
         with “day running lights” will position vehicle where lights do not shine toward a
         moving aircraft.
         A2.4.8.7.3. The Tinker Base Weather Station disseminates weather advisories,
         watches and warnings on the local LAN during periods of inclement weather. Unit
         Commanders may impose additional airfield restrictions on their unit drivers.
         AFOSHSTD 91-100 provides additional safety information and guidance.
  A2.4.9. Runway Entry/Crossing, Runway Intrusion Prevention and Reduce non-essential
  vehicle movements on the airfield and procedures to limit vehicle traffic crossing the runway
  to an absolute minimum.
     A2.4.9.1. Emphasize the possible consequences of crossing or entering the runway
     without authorization from Tinker Ground. Unauthorized vehicles on the runway cause
     a serious potential for death and destruction. Failure to obtain authorization prior to
     entering or crossing any runway is considered a runway intrusion. Intrusions are serious
     and all vehicle operators must be thoroughly trained in runway entry/crossing procedures
     to prevent such occurrences. Remember, the primary function of a runway is the landing
     and take-off of aircraft. The runway environment is “hallowed ground.”
     A2.4.9.2. Emphasize and explain the Hold Short Line and Runway Hold Position
     Sign.
TINKERAFBI13-202_OC-ALCSUP_I 1 APRIL 2014                                                       47


     A2.4.9.3. Stop at the Hold Short Line marking/Runway Hold Position sign and obtain
     authorization from Tinker Ground to cross a runway. Give Tinker Ground location of
     entrance.
     A2.4.9.4. If requesting to enter a runway, give location and intent. Note: The only
     vehicles that have a mission requirement to be on the runways are Airfield Management,
     Barrier Maintenance, Airfield Lighting, CE Road & Grounds, SOF, Fire Department,
     FOD BOSS and Safety. Remind potential drivers that only mission essential vehicle
     operations are permitted in the MRMA/CMA. Non-essential vehicle traffic must use
     perimeter roads.
     A2.4.9.5. The only area on the airfield that does not have Hold Short markings to define
     the runway is where the runways intersect; however, runway hold position signs are
     installed. To cross or enter the intersecting runway, stop 200 feet prior to the intersecting
     runway at the runway hold position sign before requesting authorization from Ground
     Control. To cross an extended runway centerline beyond the overrun, stop a minimum of
     200 feet from edge of runway environment and request authorization from Ground
     Control.
     A2.4.9.6. When authorization is given by Tinker Ground, “read-back” the instructions
     while doing a visual check of the runway in both directions, then cross or enter the
     runway.
     A2.4.9.7. As soon as the vehicle has passed the Hold Short Line at the exit location or, if
     no hold line, 200 feet from the runway, inform Tinker Ground that you are “OFF” the
     runway and name the exit location.
  A2.4.10. Procedures for operating vehicles with daytime running lights. At night, vehicles
  with daytime running lights will not shine the vehicle lights towards a moving aircraft, but
  will park in a safe location that will allow lights pointing away from aircraft with parking
  brake set and emergency flashers on.
  A2.4.11. Vehicle Parking and Chocking Procedures.
     A2.4.11.1. POV are not authorized on the airfield without prior AM approval. There is
     no open POV parking on the airfield.
     A2.4.11.2. Unless parked in a designated parking area, all unattended vehicles on the
     airfield will park so that they will not interfere with taxiing or towed aircraft and will not
     be pointed towards a parked aircraft. When ignition is off, leave keys in the ignition. If
     vehicle has a manual transmission, place it in reverse, or if automatic, place it in park.
     Then set parking brake and leave the doors unlocked.
     A2.4.11.3. Use chocks to secure all vehicles and wheeled equipment that do not have an
     integral braking system when they are left unattended on the aircraft parking ramp. Refer
     to procedures for special purpose vehicles. Vehicles parked on a designated parking area
     are exempt.
     A2.4.11.4. When parked on the airfield at night, leave emergency lights/four-way
     flashers or beacon operating unless parked in a designated parking area.
     A2.4.11.5. Never leave your vehicle while on the airfield without advising Ground
     Control of your intentions unless parked in a designated parking area.

  A2.4.12. Airfield Violations and Consequences. Refer to chapter 4 of this instruction for
  detailed information.
     A2.4.12.1. Speeding, recklessness, ignoring FOD checkpoints and improper vehicle
     operation are the quickest ways to have your license revoked.
     A2.4.12.2. AM personnel, unit commander, program managers or ALC Ramp Monitor
     can revoke airfield driver privileges for any airfield driving violation.
     A2.4.12.3. Security Forces may stop you for an airfield driving violation, but will refer
     your violation to AM for action.
  A2.4.13. Airfield Driving and Intrusion Prevention/Communication video and/or CD’s.
  Show the airfield driving and Runway Intrusion Prevention and Communications video or
  CD’s to class. Copies of both video’s and/or CD’s are provided by AM.
  A2.4.14. AFFSA Flightline Driving CBT. Candidates must complete the Course as part of
  classroom training. The Course is available on ADLS web page. The test that is part of the
  Course will be used as part of training class. The Course test is not the final written test. The
  Course will also be completed as part of annual refresher training.
  A2.4.15. Unique unit requirements/operations and local restrictions.
     A2.4.15.1. Taxiways Bravo and Kilo are restricted to vehicle/aircraft use during
     AWACS Live Fires. Tinker Ground will issue appropriate advisories.
     A2.4.15.2. Local terms “Around the Horn” and “Multiple Intersection” are synonymous
     and are used when referring to the intersection at the north side of Runway 12/30 at
     Taxiways C, H and K. Use of either phrase is correct when requesting permission
     through this area.
     A2.4.15.3. Your unit requirements briefing.
  A2.4.16. Emergency vehicle operations. Drivers will give way/yield to all fire/crash vehicle
  ambulances, and other vehicles (AM Ops, Security, Safety) responding to an emergency. All
  emergency response vehicles must comply with airfield driving procedures for entry into and
  operation in the MRMA and CMA. EXCEPTION: Emergency response vehicles and AM
  vehicle procedures as outlined in TAFBI 13-201.
  A2.4.17. Tower or vehicle radio problem areas and visual blind spots. Areas for potential
  radio blind spots when communicating with the control tower include the ALC ramp,
  Munitions Facility and southern and western portions of the airfield and Echo ramp. Some of
  same areas cannot be seen from the Control Tower.
  A2.4.18. Procedures or restrictions for operating motorcycles, mopeds or scooters, bicycles,
  tricycles and other vehicles. Refer to chapter 3 of this instruction. Bi/Tricycle operations will
  be operated only within unit ramp areas and not in the MRMA/CMA. Bi/Tricycle operators
  must be airfield driver certified. Motorcycle/Moped operations on the airfield are prohibited
  except in designated vehicle parking areas and for the purpose of participating in the
  Motorcycle hands-on training class sponsored by Base Safety.
