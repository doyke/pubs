                  CAREER FIELD EDUCATION AND TRAINING PLAN



Part I

Preface

1. This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education
and training document that identifies life-cycle education/training requirements, training
support resources, and minimum requirements for this specialty. The CFETP will provide
personnel a clear career path to success and instill rigor in all aspects of career field training.

2. The CFETP consists of two parts. Supervisors plan, manage, and control training within
the career field using both parts of the plan.

   2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.
   Section A explains how everyone will use the plan. Section B identifies career field
   progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field
   path. Section C associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education,
   experience, training, and other). Section D indicates resource constraints. Some
   examples are funds, manpower, equipment, and facilities. Section E identifies transition
   training guide requirements for SSgt through MSgt.

   2.2. Part II includes the following: Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard
   (STS) and includes duties, tasks, technical references to support training, Air Education
   and Training Command (AETC) conducted training, wartime course, core task, and
   correspondence course requirements. Section B contains the course objective list and
   training standards supervisors will use to determine if airmen satisfied training
   requirements. Section C identifies available support materials. Air Force Qualification
   Training Packages (AFQTPs) and CerTests support both upgrade training (UGT) and
   qualification training (QT). Section D identifies a training course index supervisors can
   use to determine resources available to support training. Included here are both
   mandatory and optional courses. Section E identifies MAJCOM unique training
   requirements supervisors can use to determine additional training required for the
   associated qualification needs. Section F identifies home station training references and
   courses material required for this specialty in support of contingency/wartime training.

         2.2.1 At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and
         conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this guide.

3. Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive
effective and efficient training at the appropriate point in their careers. This plan will enable
us to train today’s work force for tomorrow’s jobs.




                                                 4
Abbreviations and Terms Explained

Advanced Distributive Learning (ADL). Anytime, anyplace learning within DoD
consisting of instructional modules comprised of sharable content objectives in an
Internet/Intranet environment.

Advanced Training (AT). A formal course which provides individuals who are qualified in
one or more positions of their Air Force Specialty (AFS) with additional skills/knowledge to
enhance their expertise in the career field. Training is for selected career airmen at the
advanced level of the AFS.

Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM). An individual on the Air Staff charged with
the responsibility for overseeing all training and career field management aspects of an Air
Force specialty or group of specialties.

Air Force Job Qualification Standard/Command Job Qualification Standard
(AFJQS/CJQS). A comprehensive task list that describes a particular job type or duty
position. Used by supervisors to document task qualifications. The tasks on the
AFJQS/CJQS are common to all persons serving in the described duty position.

Air Force Qualification Training Package (AFQTP). An instructional package designed
for use at the unit to qualify, or aid qualification, in a duty position or program, or on a piece
of equipment. AFQTPs identify the Air Force’s standardized method for performing the task.
The AFQTP may be printed (paper-based), computer-based, or in other audiovisual media.

Battlefield Airman. Airmen specifically identified as Battlefield Airmen perform tasks to
integrate and synchronize air and space operations in the deep or extended battlespace.
These airmen routinely fight with joint maneuver and SOF units.

Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP). A comprehensive, multipurpose
document encapsulating the entire spectrum of education and training for a career field. It
outlines a logical growth plan that includes training resources and is designed to make career
field training identifiable, to eliminate duplication, and to ensure this training is budget
defensible.

Certification and Testing (CerTest). A multi-media evaluation program used to test an
individual’s knowledge of principles and procedures in their career field.

Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS). Commercially-procured training products.

Computer-Based Training (CBT). A self-paced stand-alone computer product used to
deliver interactive subject and task knowledge.

Continuation Training. Additional training exceeding requirements with emphasis on
present and future duty assignments.

Core Task. A task Air Force Career Field Managers (AFCFMs) identified as a minimum
qualification requirement within an Air Force specialty or duty position. These tasks
exemplify the essence of the career field.

                                                5
Course Objective List (COL). A publication derived from initial/advanced skills course
training standard, identifying the tasks and knowledge requirements, and respective standards
provided to achieve a 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level in this career field. Supervisors use the COL to
assist in conducting graduate evaluations in accordance with AFI 36-2201, Developing,
Managing, and Conducting Training.

Critical Task. Tasks that have been identified by the work center supervisor as having a
detrimental effect on mission accomplishment if not performed correctly. Critical tasks may
or may not be the same as core tasks but are mandatory if identified as ‘critical’ to the
individual’s position by the supervisor or work center.

Diamond Tasks (♦). Diamond tasks are extremely important to the career field. Diamond
tasks are the same as core tasks with one exception--equipment shortfalls at most locations
have created problems with the actual hands-on certification of these tasks. In instances
where required equipment is not available for instruction, completion of the task’s AFQTP
and passing the corresponding CerTest is all that is required for upgrade and qualification
training. Hands-on certification should be accomplished at the first opportunity when
equipment is available. (♦) =5-level (♦♦) =7-level

Distance Learning (DL). Includes Video Teleseminar (VTS), Video Teletraining (VTT),
and Computer-Based Training (CBT). Formal courses that a training wing or a contractor
develops for export to a field location (in place of resident training) for trainees to complete
without the on-site support of the formal school instructor. For instance, courses are offered
by Air Force Institute of Technology, Air University, and Training Detachment.

Section A - General Information

4. Purpose. This CFETP provides the information necessary for Air Force Career Field
Managers (AFCFM), MAJCOM Functional Managers (MFM), commanders, training
managers, supervisors and trainers, to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective career
field training program. This plan outlines the training that individuals in the AFS should
receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career. This plan identifies initial
skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced, and proficiency training. Initial skills training is
the AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon
retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level. Normally, this training is
conducted by AETC at one of the technical training centers. Upgrade training identifies the
mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion
requirements for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-, 9-skill level. Qualification training is actual hands-
on task performance training designed to qualify an airman in a specific duty position. This
training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process. It is designed to
provide the performance skills and knowledge required to do the job. Advanced Training is
formal specialty training used for selected airmen. Proficiency training is additional
training, either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training
provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required
for upgrade. The CFETP has several purposes--some are:

  4.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field
  training program. Also, it is used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate
  point in an individual’s career.

  4.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the
  specialty and recommends education and training throughout each phase of an individual’s
  career.

  4.3. Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and
  training delivery methods.

  4.4. Identifies major resource constraints that impact full implementation of the desired
  career field training process.

5. Uses. The plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure
comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the
specialty.

  5.1. AETC training personnel will develop or revise formal resident, nonresident, field
  and exportable training based upon requirements established by the users and documented
  in Part II of the CFETP. They will also work with the AFCFM, Air Force Civil Engineer
  Support Agency Force Development Division (HQ AFCESA/CEOF), to develop
  acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training.

  5.2. MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial,
  upgrade, and proficiency requirements. OJT, resident training, contract training, CerTest,
  or exportable courses can satisfy identified requirements. MAJCOM-developed training
  to support this AFS must be identified for inclusion into the plan.

                                               9
  5.3. Unit Education and Training managers and supervisors must ensure each individual
  completes the mandatory training requirements (including MAJCOM supplemental
  requirements) for the upgrade training specified in this plan.

  5.4. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this
  plan. The lists of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.

6. Coordination and Approval. The AFCFM is the approval authority for the CFETP.
The AFCFM will initiate an annual review of this document to ensure currency and accuracy.
MAJCOM representatives and AETC personnel will identify and coordinate on the career
field training requirements. Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate
training.

9. Training Decisions. The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to
encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the Structural career field. The
spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet the training requirements.
The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate
a disjointed approach to training. The following decisions were made at the career field
Utilization & Training Workshop (U&TW) held at Naval Construction Battalion Center
(NCBC) Gulfport, MS 18-22 April 2005.

   9.1. Initial Skills Training. The initial skill course was reviewed for content.
   Additions, deletions, and modifications were made to the course. Wartime training tasks
   were identified and validated.

   9.2. Five Level Upgrade Training Requirements. Existing CDCs were reviewed and
   updated to ensure only current material remained and new technology information was
   added.

   9.3. Seven Level Upgrade Training Requirements. Seven-level training requirements
   were reviewed and validated.

   9.4. Proficiency Training. Any additional knowledge and skill requirements that were
   not taught through initial skills or upgrade training are assigned as continuation training.
   The purpose of continuation training is to provide training exceeding minimum upgrade
   training requirements with emphasis on present and future duty positions. MAJCOMs
   must develop a continuation-training program that ensures personnel in the Structural
   career field receive the necessary training at the appropriate point in their careers. The
   training program will identify both mandatory and optional training requirements.

   9.5. Supplemental Training. Subject Matter Experts (SME) and the Training
   Committee reviewed supplemental training courses for technical accuracy and identified
   training that was no longer required. They revalidated the remaining courses as
   necessary to fully support career progression in the AFS.

10. Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) Academic Programs. Enrollment in
CCAF occurs when members are awarded their primary AFSC. CCAF provides the
opportunity to obtain an Associate in Applied Sciences Degree. In addition to its associates
degree program, CCAF offers the following:

     10.1. Occupational Instructor Certification. Upon completion of instructor
     qualification training (consisting of the instructor methods course and supervised practice
     teaching). The instructor must be a full-time instructor teaching a CCAF course at the
     time of nomination. Additionally, instructors should: Hold an associate or higher degree
     from a degree-granting institution that is accredited in accordance with CCAF
     requirements. Complete a teaching practicum course of at least 5-semester hours credit.
     Complete an instructor-training course of at least 3 semester hours and have 2 years of
     experience as a CCAF instructor. Hold the journeyman (5-skill level) or higher (or fully
     qualified equivalent) in an AFS. Be recommended for certification by the affiliate school
     commander, commandant, or equivalent designated representative.

     10.2. Trade Skill Certification. When a CCAF student separates or retires, a trade skill
     certification is awarded for the primary occupational specialty. The College uses a
     competency-based assessment process for trade skill certification at one of four
     proficiency levels: Apprentice, Journeyman, Craftsman (Supervisor), or Master
     Craftsman (Manager). All are transcribed on the CCAF transcript.

     11. Degree Requirements. Prior to completing a CCAF degree, the individual must be
         awarded a 5-level and the following requirements must be met: Leadership,
         management and military studies; physical education; general education; and
         program elective requirements are identical for all programs. A student needs to
         hold the journeyman (5) level in the appropriate AFSC at the time of program
         completion. Attaining the journeyman level is waived for a student in the
         occupational specialties that do not have journeyman levels. A student must
         complete all degree requirements before separating, retiring, or becoming a
         commissioned officer. Degree programs consist of a minimum of 64 semester hours
         with requirements typically as follows:

12.2. CE Occupational Badge. The Civil Engineer badge reflects a great history and
tradition. By wearing it, you will be recognized by your fellow airmen as having achieved
an expected level of competence. The multitude of engineers before you established this
expectation through excellent service in both peace and war. Eligibility criteria for award
and wear of AF occupational badges can be found in AFI 36-2923 Aeronautical, Duty, and
Occupational Badges.

      12.2.1. CE Badge Heraldry. The gear wheel and compass have historically been
      used to represent the engineering profession, in both the military and civilian sector.
      The gear represents the essence of engineering: applying scientific principles and
      technology to practical ends. To Air Force engineers, the gear symbolizes an element
      (representing the built environment) that meshes with other environments (weapon
      systems and trained personnel) to enable the Air Force to perform its mission. The
      compass is a precision tool historically used by engineers in designing and
      constructing facilities and equipment. The gear and compass together symbolize all
      the diverse specialties within Air Force civil engineer. Finally, the wings help to
      portray the fundamental linkage between the engineering and aviation components;
      and that the built environment is the foundation supporting Air Force mission and
      people.

      12.2.2. Basic Badge. The basic badge is awarded upon successful completion of the
      apprentice course.

      12.2.3. Senior Badge. The senior badge adds a star to the top of the badge.
      Wear the senior badge after award of the 7-skill level.

      12.2.4. Master Badge. The master badge adds a wreath around the star. The
      Master Badge is awarded to master sergeant or above with 5 years in the
      specialty from award of the 7-skill level.

Part II

Section A - Specialty Training Standard

1. Implementation. This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC for the
3-level Structural Apprentice course with class beginning 24 Jan 06 and graduating 23 Mar
06.

2. Purpose. As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, this STS:

    2.1. Lists in Column 1 (Tasks, Knowledge, and Technical References) the most
    common tasks, knowledge, and Technical References (TR) necessary for airmen to
    perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level.

    2.2. Column 2 (Core Tasks) identifies core tasks (specialty-wide training requirements)
    by an asterisk (*) in the 5-skill level column or a double asterisk (**) in the 7-skill level
    column. As a minimum, trainees must complete hands-on certification on all core
    and critical tasks for skill-level upgrade.

          2.2.1. All tasks in the 3-level course column are considered wartime tasks. In
          response to a wartime scenario, these tasks will be taught in the 3-level course in a
          streamlined training environment.

          2.2.2. Tasks identified by a diamond ( ) for 5- and 7- skill levels or a double
          diamond ( ) for 7-skill level only in column 2 are extremely important to the
          career field. Equipment shortfalls at most locations however, have created
          problems with the actual hands-on certification of these tasks. In instances where
          required equipment is not available for instruction, completion of the task’s AFQTP
          and passing the corresponding CerTest is all that is required for upgrade and
          qualification training.

    2.3. Provides certification for OJT. Columns 3A, B, C, D, and E are used to record
    completion of task and knowledge training requirements. Task certification of core
    and critical tasks requires a training completion date and initials of the trainee, trainer,
    and certifier. All non-core tasks require training completion date and initials of the
    trainee and trainer only.

    2.4. Shows formal training and correspondence course requirements. Columns 4A,
    B, and C show the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result
    of training on the task/knowledge and the career knowledge provided by the initial skills
    training course, correspondence course, and computer-based training. See
    CADRE/AFSC/CDC listing maintained by the unit education and training manager for
    current CDC listings.

    2.5. Qualitative Requirements. Attachment 1 contains the Proficiency Code Key
    used to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and
    career development courses.



                                               32
2.6. Becomes a Job Qualification Standard (JQS) for on-the-job training when placed
in AF Form 623, Individual Training Record, and used according to AFI 36-2201. For
OJT, the tasks in Column 1 are trained and qualified to the go/no go level. Go means
the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets local requirements for
accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of procedures. AFQTPs, when available, shall be
used to identify Air Force standardized procedures. When used as a JQS, the following
requirements apply:

    2.6.1. Documentation. Document and certify completion of training.

           2.6.1.1. Identify current duty position requirements by circling the
           subparagraph number or letter next to the task statement. Additionally, all
           core (*) and diamond ( ) tasks should be circled. Document task completion
           by annotating columns 3A, 3B, 3C, 3D and 3E, as appropriate.

           NOTE: All entries shall be made in pencil, if applicable.

           2.6.1.2. Enter the start date of the AFQTP on the AFQTP
           documentation record. Once completed enter the completion date.
           When hands-on training is started and completed annotate the STS
           accordingly.

           2.6.1.3. Transcribing from old document (paper or automated) to
           CFETP. Use the new STS to identify and certify all current and past task
           qualifications.

                   2.6.1.3.1. For tasks previously certified and still required in the
                   current duty position:

                             2.6.1.3.1.1. For core and critical tasks, the trainer and
                             certifier evaluate airman’s current qualifications and
                             validates airman’s ability to complete the task. The new
                             certified date is entered in column 3B and the trainee and
                             certifier enter their initials in columns 3C and 3E,
                             respectively.

                             2.6.1.3.1.2. For non-core duty position tasks, the trainer
                             evaluates the airman's current qualifications and validates
                             the airman's ability to complete the task. The current date
                             is entered in column 3B and the trainee and trainer enter
                             their initials in columns 3C and 3D, respectively.

                   2.6.1.3.2. To transcribe previous certification for tasks not
                   required in the current duty position, carry forward only the
                   previous completion dates (not the initials of another person). If and
                   when these tasks become a duty position requirement, recertify with
                   current date and trainee, trainer and certifier’s initials.

                       2.6.1.3.3. Annotate the AF Form 623a , (for example, “I certify the
                       information contained in the CFETP dated XX was transcribed to the
                       CFETP dated XX, and the trainee was given the superseded
                       CFETP.” Signed and dated by the supervisor and trainee).

               2.6.1.4. Documenting Career Knowledge. When a CDC is not available,
               the supervisor identifies STS training references that the trainee requires for
               career knowledge IAW AFI 36-2201 Vol 3 and ensures, as a minimum, that
               trainees cover all mandatory items specified in AFMAN 36-2108, Enlisted
               Classification. For two-time CDC exam failures, the unit commander will
               take appropriate action IAW AFI 36-2201 Vol 3. NOTE: Career knowledge
               must be documented prior to submitting a CDC waiver.

               2.6.1.5. Decertification and Recertification. When an airman is found to
               be unqualified on a task, the supervisor shall erase previous certification and
               enter airman into qualification training. Appropriate remarks are entered on
               the AF Form 623a, On-The-Job Training Record Continuation Sheet, as to
               the reason for decertification. The individual is recertified using the normal
               certification process.

    2.7. The STS is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted
    Airman Promotion System (WAPS). Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) are developed
    at the USAF Occupational Measurement Squadron by senior NCOs with extensive
    practical experience in their career fields. The tests sample knowledge of STS subject
    matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for
    promotion to higher grades. Questions are based upon study references listed in the
    WAPS catalog. Individual responsibilities are in chapter 14 of AFI 36-2606, United
    States Air Force Reenlistment, Retention, and NCO Status Programs. WAPS is not
    applicable to the Air National Guard or Air Reserve Forces.

Explanations
* A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of knowledge for a specific task.
(Example: b and 1b)

** A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task, or for a
subject common to several tasks.

- This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course or CDC.

X This mark is used alone in the course columns to show that training is required but not given due to limitations in resources.

 NOTE: All tasks and knowledge items shown with a proficiency code are trained during war time.

NOTE 1: Diamond tasks are extremely important to the career field. Diamond tasks are the same as core tasks with
one exception--equipment shortfalls at most locations have created problems with the actual hands-on certification of
these tasks. In instances where required equipment is not available for instruction, completion of the task’s AFQTP and
passing the corresponding CerTest is all that is required for upgrade and qualification training. Hands-on certification
should be accomplished at the first opportunity when equipment is available. In locations where the equipment is
available for hands-on certification, CerTest completion is still a mandatory requirement.
NOTE 2: AFCESA is in the process of transferring all courses on CD-Rom to the new AFCESA Virtual Learning
Center. Once completed the CerTest for the applicable diamond task will be available online.

                     (This section used when developing lesson plans)

4. Measurement. Measurement of each objective is indicated as follows:

   4.1. Written Test (W) - used to sample each knowledge objective and the knowledge
   components of performance objectives.

   4.2. Performance Test (P) - used under specified conditions in a formal testing mode to
   measure student accomplishment of performance objectives after the teaching-learning
   activity has been completed.

   4.3. Progress Checks (PC) - administered by the instructor during classroom or
   laboratory instruction time to assess the student’s accomplishment of knowledge or
   performance objectives.

5. Standard. The standard is 70% on written examinations. Standards for performance
measurement are indicated in the objectives and delineated on the individual progress
checklist. Instructor assistance is provided as needed during the progress check, and students
may be required to repeat all or parts of the behavior until satisfactory performance is
attained.

6. Proficiency Level. Most task performance is taught to the “2b” proficiency level which
means the student can do most parts of the task, but does need assistance on the hardest parts
of the task (partially proficient). The student can also determine step-by-step procedures for
doing the task.

7. Course Objective List. These objectives are listed in the sequence taught by Block of
Instruction.

   7.1 Initial Skills Course. A detailed listing of the initial skills course objectives may be
   obtained by written request to 366 TRS/DO, 727 Missile Road, Sheppard AFB TX
   76311-2254.

8. CerTest.

   8.1. CerTest is a program that uses computer-based evaluation to ensure skilled
   craftsmen are available to meet the Air Force's changing needs. It enhances upgrade
   and qualification training by testing and evaluating an individual's knowledge of the
   principles and procedures in each specialty.

        8.1.1. The program contains tests used evaluate task knowledge received through
        different media such as paper products (text), videotapes, and computer–based
        programs.

        8.1.2. The CerTest program contains mandatory tests, required for upgrade. All
        diamond ( ) coded tasks on the STS have a corresponding mandatory test.

        8.1.3. CerTest is also a powerful training management tool. It can be used to find
        the strengths and weaknesses in an individual's training and experience. CerTest
        automatically records and updates all test results. The training manager can copy
        records to a disk so that an individual can bring current, accurate training
        information to a new unit; thereby helping the gaining supervisor evaluate the
        trainee's knowledge and experience.

    8.2. CerTest also enables unit personnel to develop site-specific tests. These custom-
    made tests standardize testing on tasks unique to a specific duty station and/or
    assignment. The program contains a graphics library that may be used along with a
    menu-driven test editor to develop these site-specific tests.

    8.3. CerTest also contains optional CDC pre-evaluation tools. Volume review
    exercises are available for progress checks after each volume is completed. After all
    volumes are completed in a set, the trainee may take the course review exercise before
    taking the final End of Course exam at the base training office. Commanders are
    encouraged to integrate these tools in their unit’s OJT program.

    8.4. CerTest has been adopted as the Air Force platform for future electronic CDC
    testing. The Air Force Institute for Distributive Learning (AFIADL) began using
    CerTest on 1 June 2000. Currently, all CE AFSs are allowed to use AFIADL’s CerTest
    on installations where Base Test Control Facilities (TCFs) are equipped. See your
    UETM for further information.

    8.5. The mandatory CerTests for each AFSC are identified, by number, with it’s
    corresponding AFQTP on the 3E3X1 AFQTP Documentation Record.

    8.6. For a complete list of up-to-date AFQTPs applicable to the 3E3X1 AFSC see our

                      SECTION F - HOME STATION TRAINING

15. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to identify the tasks, training references, and
training sources available in support of contingency/wartime training. Prime BEEF forces
will train to meet the full range of tasks expected in the contingency environment. Training
ranges from knowledge-type training conducted in a classroom (CAT 1), to task-oriented
hands-on (CAT II) training conducted in the field. These training requirements, frequencies,
and sources are listed in AFI 10-210, Prime Base Emergency Engineer Force (BEEF)
Program.

    15.1. Home Station Training (HST). HST is training that is conducted at the
    individual’s home station for contingency operations. The Civil Engineer Commander
    ensures training is provided and documented and arranges for subject matter experts to
    conduct training as required. Home Station training requirements fall into two
    categories, CAT I and CAT II.

           15.1.1. Category I (CAT-I) Training. Personnel assigned to base level Civil
           Engineer units will receive initial and refresher training in all CAT I (knowledge-
           based) topics as shown in AFI 10-210, Chapter 4, Attachment 2. Units will use
           Readiness Training Packages (RTPs), Qualification Training Packages (QTPs),
           other multimedia training packages, videos, and AF CE standardized lesson plans
           to present the material. MAJCOMs may develop and require other training
           materials to accomplish knowledge-based training.

                  15.1.1.1. Prime BEEF Orientation/General Contingency. Upon
                  assignment to the unit, all military and emergency-essential civilian
                  employees will be trained on the unit’s Prime BEEF and Emergency
                  Management missions. The training will emphasize the individual’s role
                  and how he or she fits into the program. It will also include an overview
                  of Civil Engineer Doctrine and explain the organization, training,
                  equipment, operating concepts, and contingency missions pertaining to
                  the unit.

                  15.1.1.2. General Contingency Responsibilities CD-ROM (GCRCD).
                  Personnel may receive annual credit for the applicable CAT I training
                  through completion of one of two available GCRCDs (one for 3-level civil
                  engineers; the second for all other personnel). The 3-level product is a
                  detailed version specifically designed for use as initial CAT I training.
                  Use of this product has become critical in light of recent reductions in
                  technical Prime BEEF training and education. All airmen should
                  complete this course within 90 days upon arrival at their first duty station
                  (6 months for ARC members). A second GCRCD product is available as
                  an optional source for attaining recurring CAT I training for those task
                  identified in AFI 10-210, Attachment 2. Duplication of both CDs is
                  strongly encouraged. AFCESA is in the process of transferring all courses
                  on CD-Rom to the new AFCESA Virtual Learning Center.

       15.1.1.3. Certification Test (CERTEST). Personnel who pass a
       CERTEST computer-based exam in a CAT I contingency subject area
       can receive credit for that training requirement. Document training as
       outlined in AFI 10-210.

15.1.2. Category II (CAT-II) Training. CAT II training is primarily hands-on
training as outlined in AFI 10-210, Chapter 4, Attachment 3. Units must make
every effort to incorporate realism into their respective CAT II training programs.
Field gear (to include primary weapons) will be used during training requirements
such as, personal/work party security, convoy operations, defensive fighting
positions, etc.

       15.1.2.1. Combat Skills Training (CST). CST must be institutionalized
       as an integral part of any CAT II HST program. Lessons learned from
       operations such as IRAQI FREEDOM have taught us the importance of
       maintaining a higher level of combat readiness. Although the inclusion
       of combat skills-focused training into HST does not fully prepare CE
       personnel to work in a high threat combat environment, the steps taken to
       enhance CAT II training will help elevate units to a readiness level
       capable of supporting safe and effective operations in low to medium risk
       combat environments.

       15.1.2.2. Mission Essential Equipment Training (MEETS). Wartime
       or contingency environments often involve the use of specialized and
       unique mission-essential equipment the Civil Engineers do not use in
       their day-to-day operations. Due to the cost and complexity, mission
       essential contingency equipment and trainer expertise are not commonly
       found at CONUS installations. Personnel must be hands-on certified and
       the certification documented in their CFEPT. AFI 10-210, Tables 4.1-
       4.6 identifies minimum personnel to be trained, positions by specialty,
       frequencies and locations of training sites. Inadequate training on these
       key equipment items can negatively impact Air Force contingency
       operations.

15.1.3. Category III (CAT III) Training. Team Training Venues

       15.1.3.1. Silver Flag Exercise Sites (CAT III). Silver Flag Exercise
       Sites are located at Tyndall AFB, FL; Ramstein AB, Germany; and
       Kadena AB, Japan and conduct CAT III training with their major focus
       on students being able to perform critical contingency task in a team
       environment. The training focuses on bare base beddown and
       sustainment operations using hands-on training with BEAR equipment in
       a realistic beddown environment. Where possible, combat skills training
       has been added to the curriculum to ensure realism and help fortify
       combat skills mentality amongst teams. All CE personnel who fill Unit
       Type Code (UTC) positions will receive team training at Silver Flag
       Exercise Sites with the exception of members on headquarters staff
       augmentation UTCs, pavement evaluation UTCs, and generator repair
       and maintenance UTCs.
