     2.2. OPSEC: Protection of Critical Information (CI) within 39 ABW plans, checklist and
     plans correspondence is vital to security and mission accomplishment of operations. Unit
     must remain aware, at all times, of the need to safeguard CI. All 39 ABW personnel affected
     by the plan are responsible for ensuring OPSEC.
     2.3. Storage: Plans must be stored in accordance with their classification. Plans containing
     sensitive or critical information are designated For Official Use Only (FOUO) and may
     require protection against public disclosure. Mark and store classified plans according to
     approved classification guidance and Department of Defense (DoD) 5200.1-R, Information
     Security Program.
3. Plan Creation.
     3.1. Any unit wishing to or tasked to develop a plan should first consult 39 ABW/IGI to
     determine if a similar document already exists. The unit will then gather the necessary
     information and build the plan according to the guidance in this document and any applicable
     HHQ documentation. Refer to Paragraph 5 for plan review and approval procedures.
4. Plan Development.
     4.1. Plan Title and Numbering:
        4.1.1. Wing plans are assigned a number and title to coincide with the number and title
        of the HHQ plans they support. If there is no HHQ plan, the plan number will
        correspond to the governing Air Force Instruction or other directive it supports.
        4.1.2. 39 ABW plans will be classified as Operations Plans (OPLANS), Concept Plans
        (CONPLANs), Functional Plans (FUNCPLANS) or Supporting Plans IAW AFI 10-401,
        paragraph 3.3.
     4.2. Plan Contents:
        4.2.1. Wing plans are written in the format described in this instruction unless otherwise
        prescribed in a HHQ directive. This instruction is based on AFMAN 10-401 Volume 2,
        Planning Formats and Guidance, and follows that format. Deviations should be kept to a
        minimum to maintain standardization.
        4.2.2. Plans are comprised of a number of elements including a cover, memorandum of
        transmittal, security instructions (with record of changes and record of review), plan
        summary, table of contents, basic plan and annexes. All 39 ABW plans will include these
        elements in the order listed, unless specified otherwise in HHQ directives.
        4.2.3. The front cover must show the date of the plan, the OPR, 39 ABW, long title, and
        number of the plan. See AFMAN 10-401, Vol 2, for guidance on properly marking the
        plan’s classification.
        4.2.4. The Memorandum of Transmittal of a plan should identify the reason for
        preparing the plan. The need for preparing further supporting plans must be specified.
        The OPR for the plan must be identified and disposition instructions must be included
        when the plan supersedes a previous plan. The Memorandum of Transmittal is not
        numbered and is signed by the 39 ABW/CC. The date of the transmittal letter should be
        the same as that of the plan.
INCIRLIKABI10-401 27 MARCH 2014                                                                5


     4.2.5. The Security Instructions and Record of Changes page is the first numbered page
     (use lower case Roman numbers -- i.e., “i” for the first page). The security instructions
     must include the long and short titles of the plan and will state any reproduction
     limitations. A record of changes is not necessary for changes made during formal
     reviews.
     4.2.6. Include a Plan Summary for all plans. It provides a brief review of the mission,
     general situation, and concept of operations and commander’s appraisal of the logistics
     and personnel feasibility of the plan.      The following paragraphs are mandatory;
     subparagraphs are at the discretion of the plan OPR: 1.) Purpose, 2.) Conditions for
     Implementation, 3.) Operations to be Conducted, 4.) Key Assumptions, 5.) Operational
     Constraints, 6.) OPSEC, 7.) Command Relationships, 8.) Logistics Appraisal, and 9.)
     Personnel Appraisal. (The numbering should be consistent throughout the entire
     document – see Paragraph 4.1.2.)
     4.2.7. The Table of Contents will include the first page of each division. It will also
     include elements published separately.
     4.2.8. The Basic Plan consists of the five major paragraphs: (The numbering should be
     consistent throughout the entire document – see Paragraph 4.1.2.) 1.) Situation, 2.)
     Mission, 3.) Execution, 4.) Administration and Logistics, and 5.) Command and Control.
     Additional paragraph headings may be included to fit the needs of the plan. The five
     paragraphs of the basic plan must be listed in every plan, even if they are not applicable.
     If they do not apply, “Not Applicable” will be inserted after the paragraph title (for
     example, “4.) Administration and Logistics. Not Applicable.”). This method permits
     standardization and enables planners to refer immediately to a standard paragraph when
     seeking specific information.
     4.2.9. Attachments to the basic plan listed in order of increasing detail are annexes,
     appendices, tabs and exhibits. The basic plan should refer to each annex that has been
     prepared; however, information provided in the basic plan is not normally repeated in the
     attachments. If other attachments are used, the planner should refer to any appendices in
     the text of the annex and to any tabs in the text of the appendix. The table of contents
     should contain a listing of all annexes, appendices, tabs, exhibits and maps. Annexes
     used for the plan should be listed on the final page of the basic plan. Other attachments
     (appendices, tabs, exhibits or maps) are listed on the final page of any attachment that has
     further attachments.
        4.2.9.1. An appendix is a subordinate addition to an annex. It includes information
        too lengthy or detailed for the basic annex. Normally, each appendix is devoted to a
        major category of information. For example, if a plan requires more than one
        response option, a separate appendix could be used to address each option.
        4.2.9.2. A tab is a further subdivision of an appendix used to organize and clarify the
        presentation of detailed data. Tabs are prepared in the same general format as
        appendices.
        4.2.9.3. An exhibit is a further subdivision of a tab to enable the planner to organize
        the portrayal of greater levels of detail.
6                                                     INCIRLIKABI10-401 27 MARCH 2014


           4.2.9.4. References. List documents that are required for complete understanding of
           the annex or appendix. Do not duplicate references in annexes or appendices that are
           listed in the basic plan. If no references are required, continue with the next
           paragraph. Additional information concerning plan format is available in AFMAN
           10-401, Vol. 2.
       4.2.10. An annex is produced by a functional area (e.g. Operations, Logistics, etc.) and
       describes the concept of mission support by the functional area. It contains detailed
       information for a specific organization or subject. All 39 ABW plans will contain, as a
       minimum, Annex A (Tasked Organization), Annex B (Terms and Definitions), Annex C
       (Operations), Annex Y (Operations Security) and Annex Z (Distribution). Per AFMAN
       10-401, Vol. 2, the letters “I” and “O” must not be used as annex designators. Other
       annexes will be assigned by the plan OPR.
       4.2.11. OPSEC is discussed briefly in the Plan Summary and Basic Plan. Ensure
       OPSEC is addressed as Annex Y. A template for the OPSEC annex is contained in
       Attachment 3 of this instruction.
       4.2.12. Include a list of all organization tasked by the plan in Annex A.
    4.3. Paragraph Formatting:
       4.3.1. Paragraphs will be subdivided by using the numeric system as reflected in this
       document.
       4.3.2. Plans will be typed in Times New Roman, font size 12.
       4.3.3. Pages are numbered at the bottom center to indicate the page order within each
       element of the plan. Thus, page C-1-A-3 denotes page 3 of Tab A to Appendix 1 to
       Annex C.
       4.3.4. Each new “section” (basic plan, annex, appendix, tab, etc.) must start on a front
       (odd) page. Pages marked “THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK” will be
       inserted as required to ensure this happens.
       4.3.5. Plan covers, Memorandum of Transmittal, and Distribution Change Memorandum
       will stand alone (nothing printed on the back). Exception: Page numbers and/or “THIS
       PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK” may appear on the back of Memorandum of
       Transmittal and Distribution Change Memorandum.
    4.4. Plan Classification:
       4.4.1. The plan cover will have the following information: plan identification number
       (see Paragraph 4.1. above), long title, full date of basic plan, overall classification
       (including appropriate caveats – e.g., Formerly Restricted Data (FRD), No Foreign
       (NOFORN), etc.) at top and bottom, front and back of the cover, downgrading
       declassification instructions and the 39 ABW emblem. The cover page must not contain
       any classified information.
       4.4.2. Each page (front and back) will contain the appropriate security classification
       header and footer.
INCIRLIKABI10-401 27 MARCH 2014                                                                  7


      4.4.3. Refer to DoD 5200.1-PH, DoD Guide to Marking Classified Documents, for
      additional guidance on the preparation and marking of plans classified CONFIDENTIAL
      or SECRET.
      4.4.4. Secret FRD and Secret Restricted Data (RD) will not have declassification
      instructions, according to DoD 5200.1-R, Information Security Program, paragraph
      C5.12.e.
      4.4.5. The back cover will be blank except for overall classification markings at the top
      and bottom of page.
      4.4.6. If the plan is classified Secret or higher, the cover will be red. If the plan is
      Confidential, the cover will be blue. If the plan is FOUO or is not classified, the cover
      will be black and white. At a minimum, all plans generated by the 39 ABW will be
      marked “For Official Use Only.”
5. Plan Validation Process
   5.1. Internal Review
      5.1.1. A 39 ABW plan is current for two years from the date approved by the 39
      ABW/CC or the date of the last formal wing review of the plan unless the review interval
      is otherwise directed in HHQ guidance.
      5.1.2. OPRs must begin a plan review approximately two months before the plan
      becomes overdue. The review is intended to identify areas requiring updates, changes or
      modifications.
      5.1.3. Units will review their own plans and annotate the review on the Security
      Instructions page.
      5.1.4. If no changes are required, a formal plan review memorandum will be routed
      through 39 ABW/IGI for 39 ABW/CC signature (Attachment 4). If the plan needs only
      administrative or minor changes, an interim change can be issued and the plan’s
      publication date doesn’t change. If there are substantial changes or the plan is five years
      old, it will undergo a formal revision which includes format updates and a review by all
      39 ABW units.
      5.1.5. An interim change to a plan or annex of a plan will be prepared and coordinated
      with all affected agencies by the plan OPR. Once approved, the interim change will be
      issued to all organizations on the distribution list by 39 ABW/IGI.
      5.1.6. The date of the change, the date of the basic plan, and the classification of the plan
      must be included in paragraph 1 of the Memorandum of Transmittal.
      5.1.7. A copy of the distribution list must be attached to the Memorandum of
      Transmittal. If a new Annex Z is accomplished, a distribution list is not required. The
      “To” element should read: “See Attached Distribution List” or “See Annex Z.”
   5.2. External Revision
      5.2.1. A revision is required when a plan is more than five years old, or when major
      changes need to be made.
 8                                                       INCIRLIKABI10-401 27 MARCH 2014


        5.2.2. Major changes include any actions that require the participation of another unit.
        The OPR cannot change the responsibilities that belong to a separate unit without
        receiving the approval of that unit commander.
        5.2.3. A revision is a formal review by all applicable wing agencies. Proposed changes will
        be annotated on a Comment Resolution Matrix (CRM), which will accompany the plan.
            5.2.3.1. The plan OPR will review the CRM and is responsible for annotating each
            item as accepted, rejected or modified. All rejected comments must be re-coordinated
            with the comment originator. If agreement is not reached, 39 ABW/IGI will
            determine how the rejected comments will be resolved.
        5.2.4. If a plan is revised, it must be routed by the OPR to HHQ functional managers to
        ensure the plan meets HHQ guidance. This coordination and HHQ approval may be
        documented keeping a digitally signed e-mail on file.
        5.2.5. The 39 ABW/IGI or wing plan OPR can direct an out-of-cycle review of any plan
        for which they are the OPR. An out-of-cycle review is when the review process is
        initiated at any time other than a plan’s required review date.
        5.2.6. Regardless of the plan OPR, 39 ABW/IGI will provide direction and oversight of
        the coordination process and review plans prior to coordination at the squadron and group
        commander level and subsequent approval by the wing commander.
6. Approval.
     6.1. Once a plan is reviewed by unit commanders and all comments on the CRM have been
     addressed, the IGI office will notify the OPR, who will produce a final hard copy version for
     routing to the 39 ABW/CC.
7. Distribution.
     7.1. After the plan or interim changes have been approved, 39 ABW/IGI will electronically
     notify the units listed on the distribution list (Annex Z) of its location.
     7.2. All units on the distribution list will be familiar with the electronic location of each plan
     they are tasked to support. The plan will also be posted on the 39 ABW SharePoint website.
     Classified plans will be posted on the wing SIPR server.
     7.3. Hard copy distribution will not occur. If a unit needs the plan in hard copy, it will be
     responsible for printing it on the appropriate color paper based on the plan’s overall security
     classification.
8. Wing Index of Plans.
     8.1. 39 ABW/IGI will publish a Wing Index of Plans, listing all current plans. A copy of the
     index will be maintained on the 39 ABW SharePoint website.
     8.2. 39 ABW/IGI will maintain the United States Air Forces In Europe (USAFE) Index of Plans.

2. CRITICAL INFORMATION: Primary considerations for OPSEC are mission
communications and specific mission data, including routings and aircraft capabilities.
3. TASKS: All personnel must avoid non-secure communications or overt actions which would
reveal critical information to unauthorized persons.
39 ABW OPSEC representatives will provide the 39 ABW Critical Information List (CIL) to all
Squadrons and Wing Staff Agencies assigned to the 39 ABW for briefing and posting.
Each Group/Squadron/Wing Staff Agency OPSEC Point of Contact (POC) will advise their
respective plans representative with their individual CIL. This allows for CIL’s to be updated at
the earliest possible time in the planning phase in order to reflect the individual characteristics of
this plan.
