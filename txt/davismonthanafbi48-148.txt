Terms
Abnormal Exposure Level— An exposure that, if continued at the same rate, would exceed the
limits specified in 10 CFR Part 20 and AFOSH Standard 48-125.
ALARA— As Low As Reasonably Achievable. A concept devised for management and
administrative actions taken to maintain exposures to radiation ―as low as is reasonably
achievable‖ consistent with existing technology, costs, and operational requirements. Scientific
evidence suggesting no level of radiation exposure is totally risk-free led to the development of
the ALARA concept.
ALI (Annual Limit on Intake)— The derived limit for radioactive material taken into the body
of an adult worker by inhalation or ingestion in a year. ALI values differ on the type of
radionuclide in question.
Investigation Action Level (IAL)— A dosimetry result that requires an investigation to
determine the reason for the exposure. Local threshold limit at DM AFB is established at 0.125
rem per quarter (0.5 rem annually). For pregnant workers, local threshold limit is established at
DAVISMONTHANAFBI48-148 5 OCTOBER 2011                                                           21


0.005 rem per month (0.05 rem per duration of pregnancy). Personnel should not receive a dose
in excess of 0.125 mrem quarterly. When exposure to personnel is above the local threshold
limit, investigation on the exposure will be conducted to determine the causative factors and
identify corrective measures.
Ionizing Radiation— Any electromagnetic or particulate radiation capable of producing ions
(free electrons or other charged subatomic particles) directly or indirectly in its passage through
matter. Ionizing radiation includes X-rays, gamma rays, alpha particles, beta particles, neutrons,
and protons.
Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPE)— The maximum level of laser radiation (radiant
exposure or integrated radiance) that does not cause adverse effects.
Non—ionizing Radiation – Any electromagnetic radiation incapable of producing ions directly
or indirectly. Microwave, Radio Frequency Radiation (RFR), infrared, ultraviolet, and Laser
(light amplification by stimulated emission radiation) are forms of non-ionizing radiation.
Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL)— The PEL is the maximum exposure level that will not
cause damaging biological effects. The PELs for RFR are based upon a whole-body specific
absorption rate (SAR) expressed in watts per kilogram (W/kg). There are no special RFR
exposure limits for pregnant females. Any RFR environment that is safe for the mother is also
safe for the developing embryo or fetus.
Radioactive Material (RAM)— Materials whose nuclei, because of their unstable nature, decay
by emission of ionizing radiation. The radiation emitted may be alpha or beta particles, gamma
or X-rays, or neutrons. Also known as radioisotopes.
Thermo Luminescent Dosimeter (TLD)— A type of dosimeter that uses powdered or solid
phosphor materials to record radiation exposures. When heated, the phosphor emits light
proportional to the amount of radiation energy absorbed. This type of dosimeter consists of a
card and a holder (badge).
USAF Radioactive Material Permit (RAM Permit)— A written authorization from the USAF
Radioisotope Committee for USAF organizations to receive, possess, distribute, use, transfer, or
dispose of radioactive materials.
USAF Radioisotope Committee— A committee established to coordinate the administrative
and regulatory aspects of licensing, receiving, possessing, using, distributing, storing,
transporting, transferring and disposing of all radioactive materials in the Air Force (except
nuclear weapons and reactor systems).

                               LOCAL THRESHOLD LIMIT

A2.1. In accordance with AFI 48-148, Ionizing Radiation Protection, Chapter 3, para 3.4.3,
Installation RSOs shall establish local threshold levels for dose or radionuclide intake, above
which an investigation is conducted to determine the causative factors, and identify corrective
measures. Local threshold limit at is established as 0.125 mrem. Personnel should not receive a
dose in excess of 0.125 mrem quarterly.
A2.2. Do not expose pregnant workers to levels of radiation that will result in a dose greater
than 0.5 rem during the term of the pregnancy. The investigation action level (IAL) for pregnant
workers is 0.05 rem (0.005 rem/month).
A2.3. When exposure to personnel is above the local threshold limit, investigation on the
exposure will be conducted to determine the causative factors and identify corrective measures.
A2.4. The base RSO investigates administrative doses when lost, damaged or not returned.
Review historical doses by person and the highest dose received in the monitoring period by
anyone in the shop to correct the dose.

             BASIC RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL SHIPPING PROCEDURES

A4.1. Each receiving or shipping agency must have a separate, marked, and locked enclosure for
the receipt, handling, or shipment of radioactive packages. This separate area will prevent
accidental exposure to ionizing radiation. This location must be coordinated with the base RSO.
A4.2. All radioactive materials covered by a license or permit must be accounted for by a
radioactive material transfer receipt, which is separate from any contractual, security, or other
receipt documents. Contract shipping and receiving agencies should obtain transfer receipts
when dispensing items to DMAFB organizations.
A4.3. Organizations planning to ship or receive RAM contact the base RSO or designated
representative to monitor the container. If the receiving or shipping agency is a contractor, the
contractor is not required to notify the base RSO. The contractor must perform all
labeling, packaging, and monitoring requirements outlined in 10 CFR and 49 CFR.
NOTE: In accordance with 10 CFR 20.1906, all packages labeled with a Radioactive White I,
Yellow II, or Yellow III, as specified by DOT regulations (49 CFR 172.403 and 172.436-440),
must be monitored as soon as possible but not later than three (3) hours after the package is
received. Survey the package no later than three hours from the beginning of the next workday if
received after normal duty hours.
   A4.3.1. The most recent leak test results must accompany the package if the radioactive
   material is a sealed source. Send a copy of these results to the base RSO. If this test does not
   accompany the sealed source, an individual approved by the base RSO will perform a leak
   test before it is used. Current leak test results must accompany sealed sources shipped from
   DMAFB.
   A4.3.2. Contact the user or custodian and transport the material directly to the user or
   custodian after the RSO or approved individual monitors and clears the package. If the user
   or custodian cannot be located, store the radioactive material until the user or custodian
   accepts receipt. Note: Only authorized personnel will open or package containers of
   radioactive material or items.
A4.4. When transporting radioactive material from DMAFB, prepare for shipment and
packaging per applicable NRC and Department of Transportation regulations (Title 49 of the
Code of Federal Regulations). Contact the base RSO for assistance and shipping surveys.
