exception in this instruction.
     1.9.1. Forwarding Claims. SJAs forward claims they cannot take final action on to the next higher
     settlement authority within 120 days of receipt. For medical malpractice claims, see the additional

     offer. Any offer letter must contain the citation to the statute under which the claim was adjudicated.
        1.9.2.1. Before the settlement authority pays the claimant, the claimant must accept the amount
        offered in full satisfaction of the claim, and sign a settlement agreement.
        1.9.2.2. If the claimant rejects the offer, further negotiations may be conducted. In the event there
        is an outstanding offer on the claim and the claimant is given a specific date by which to accept the
        offer and it is not accepted, a separate denial letter must be sent; do not send offer letters contain-
        ing self-executing denials at some time in the future. Do not put a contingent denial in the settle-
        ment offer, e.g., “If this offer is not acceptable, your claim is denied.”
     1.9.3. Denying Claims. The settlement authority sends a final denial letter to the claimant or autho-
     rized agent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. The letter must be mailed the same
     day as the date that appears on the letter. The letter must state:
        1.9.3.1. The full title and legal citation of the statute under which the settlement authority consid-
        ered the claim.
        1.9.3.2. The reasons for denial.
        1.9.3.3. For FTCA claims, the letter must include the following language: “If [you/your client/
        John Doe] is dissatisfied with this decision, [you/he/she/they/John Doe] may file suit in an appro-
        priate United States District Court not later than six months after the date of mailing of this letter.”
        1.9.3.4. For MCA and NGCA claims, and Claims by Members for Certain Losses of Household
        Effects Caused by Hostile Act, the letter must contain the following language: “This is the final
        denial of [your/your client’s/John Doe’s] claim under the [appropriate act, e.g. Military Claims
        Act, etc.]. However, if [you/your client/John Doe] so desire[s], [you/he/she/John Doe] may appeal
        this decision. No particular form is necessary, but the appeal should be in writing, describe the rea-
        sons for the appeal, provide any additional evidence to substantiate the claim, and arrive at this
        office within 60 days of the date of this letter.”

1.10. Acting on Reconsiderations. Claimants may request reconsideration under the FTCA and other
claims statutes, unless a statutory appeal is provided (appeals are provided under the MCA, NGCA, and
Claims by Members for Certain Losses of Household Effects Caused by Hostile Act).
     1.10.1. In its regulations (28 CFR, Part 14), the DoJ provides a claimant the opportunity to request
     reconsideration of the denial of a claim under the FTCA. Those regulations are controlling. The
     request for reconsideration must be received by the Air Force not later than 6 months after the date of
     the mailing of the denial letter. Upon receipt of a request for reconsideration under the FTCA:
AFI51-501_ACC_I 29 JUNE 2006                                                                                15


       1.10.1.1. The settlement authority reviews the claim and any new evidence submitted to deter-
       mine if an offer is appropriate. If so, and if the offer is within its settlement limits, the settlement
       authority makes an offer.
       1.10.1.2. If the claim is not settled, or the settlement authority recommends denial of the claim,
       the settlement authority forwards the claim, as soon as possible after receipt, to AFLSA/JACT or
       AFLSA/JACE (for environmental tort claims). No settlement authority below AFLSA/JACT or
       JACE may deny a claim on reconsideration under the FTCA.
       1.10.1.3. Settlement authorities do not mention reconsideration in the original denial letter.
       1.10.1.4. An FTCA claim may only be reconsidered once.
   1.10.2. For other claims statutes (when there is no statutory appeal), a settlement authority has the
   inherent authority to reconsider a final decision. The request for reconsideration should be received
   within 60 days of the date of the mailing of the denial letter unless good cause is shown.
       1.10.2.1. The mere fact that a request for reconsideration is received (other than under the FTCA)
       does not obligate the settlement authority to reopen the claim.
       1.10.2.2. Reconsideration is not mentioned in the original letter of denial.
       1.10.2.3. A settlement authority reconsiders the final action on a non-FTCA claim when there is:
           1.10.2.3.1. New and material evidence concerning the claim.
           1.10.2.3.2. Obvious errors in the original decision.
       1.10.2.4. A settlement authority must document in the claim file its reason for reconsideration.
       1.10.2.5. A settlement authority above the original settlement authority may direct a claim be for-
       warded to a higher settlement authority for reconsideration.

1.11. Acting on Appeals. A claimant has a statutory right to appeal the denial of claims under the MCA,
the NGCA, and Claims by Members for Certain Losses of Household Effects Caused by Hostile Act. A
settlement authority receiving a timely appeal (within 60 days after the date of mailing of the final denial,
unless the claimant provides good cause):
   1.11.1. Reviews the appeal.
   1.11.2. Reaches a final settlement with the claimant, or forwards the file to the next higher appellate
   authority with a recommendation for final action.
   1.11.3. No settlement authority below AFLSA/JACT or JACE may deny an appeal.
   1.11.4. The following are appellate authorities:
       1.11.4.1. For claims denied below AFLSA/JACT or JACE, a Branch Chief at AFLSA/JACT or
       JACE designated as a settlement authority under this instruction.
       1.11.4.2. For claims denied by a Branch Chief, AFLSA/JACT or JACE, the Chief, AFLSA/JACT
       or JACE (as appropriate).
       1.11.4.3. For claims denied by the Chief, AFLSA/JACT or JACE, the Director, AFLSA/JAC.
       1.11.4.4. For claims denied by the Director, AFLSA/JAC, the DJAG.
16                                                                    AFI51-501_ACC_I 29 JUNE 2006


        1.11.4.5. For claims denied by the DJAG, the TJAG.
        1.11.4.6. For claims denied by the TJAG, the SAF, or the SAF’s designee.
     1.11.5. Any higher appellate authority may act upon an appeal, e.g. the TJAG may act upon an appeal
     of a claim denied by AFLSA/JAC. However, it is solely within the discretion of the higher appellate
     authority to do so.

1.12. Handling Requests for Tort Claim Files. Tort claim files are the property of the Air Force and
are protected from disclosure under the attorney work-product privilege.
     1.12.1. Do not give claim files to claimants or their agents for review or reproduction.
     1.12.2. Process Freedom of Information Act or Privacy Act requests for files in accordance with DoD
     5400.7-R/Air Force Supplement and AFI 33-332, respectively.
     1.12.3. Never release, outside the US government, these documents from the claim file:
        1.12.3.1. Legal memoranda containing opinions, conclusions, and recommendations.
        1.12.3.2. Attorneys’ and paralegals' written summaries of witness interviews.
        1.12.3.3. Experts' written reports and evaluations (including engineering reports on sonic boom
        complaints), without approval of AFLSA/JACT.
        1.12.3.4. Medical Quality Assurance documents (10 U.S.C. 1102). See further restrictions at
        paragraph 1.20.2.
        1.12.3.5. Other material acquired as part of the deliberative process, including legal research.

1.13. Prohibited Actions. Claims personnel must not:
     1.13.1. Give any opinion to the claimant about an anticipated approval or disapproval of the claim.
     1.13.2. Reveal the recommendations of a settlement authority outside claims channels.

1.14. Avoiding Conflicting Interests. Air Force personnel must not represent any claimant or potential
claimant in a claim against the United States. Responding to claimant inquiries on the policies and proce-
dures for filing a claim is not considered to be representing a claimant. At the same time, claims personnel
must be mindful that their client is the Air Force and avoid actions which are adverse to those of their cli-
ent.

1.15. Handling Medical Malpractice Claims.
     1.15.1. Claims personnel conduct interviews of each significantly involved provider and other rele-
     vant witnesses to the incident, and annotate the DD Form 2526, Case Abstract for Malpractice
     Claims, for each provider significantly involved in a claim of negligent treatment. See AFI 44-119,
     Clinical Performance Improvement, paragraph 8.7, and Attachment 22.

       1.15.2.3. Retrieve all original medical records from the medical treatment facility and ensure the
       original records are numbered prior to copying.

EXCEPTION: If an attorney represents the claimant, settlement authorities name both the claimant and
the attorney as payees on the payment voucher, using the attorney’s address.
   1.16.1. Settlement authorities sending claims to the Department of the Treasury for payment (claims
   under the FTCA for payment over $2500 (see paragraph 2.5.), or MCA, NGCA or FCA claims over
   $100,000), use:
       1.16.1.1. FMS Form 195, Judgment Fund Payment Request.

   2.5.1. To receive payment, claimants must sign a settlement agreement in the format designated by
   the DoJ. The Air Force attorney signs the settlement agreement after receiving a fully executed agree-
   ment from the claimant and the Air Force settlement authority approves the agreement. In settlements
20                                                                   AFI51-501_ACC_I 29 JUNE 2006

AFI51-501_ACC_I 29 JUNE 2006                                                                           21


                                               Chapter 3

                                MILITARY CLAIMS ACT CLAIMS

3.1. Scope of this Chapter. This chapter implements DoD Directive 5515.3, Settlement of Claims Under
10 U.S.C. 2733 and 2734, 18 August 1965; DoD Directive 5515.8, Single Service Assignment of Respon-
sibility for Processing of Claims, 9 June 1990; and the MCA, 10 U.S.C. 2733.
   3.1.1. For single service claims responsibility, see Chapter 4, Section 4A.

   damage arising from the negligent or wrongful acts by members or employees of the armed forces act-
   ing within the scope of employment, and for losses sustained as a result of the noncombat activities of
   the military services. The MCA applies worldwide. However, for claims arising in the United States,
   the MCA only applies to noncombat activities and incident to service property damage claims of mil-
   itary members. The statute prohibits payment if the claim is payable under the FTCA or the FCA. Pay-
   ment under the Act is made “[u]nder such regulations as the Secretary concerned may prescribe…”
   This instruction prescribes how the MCA is implemented. The Act allows only an administrative
   determination of claims. There is no judicial remedy.

       3.2.3.2. Approve claims in an amount not to exceed $25,000, notwithstanding the amount
       claimed.
   3.2.4. The SJAs of 3AF, 5AF and 9AF (for USCENTCOM) and the SJAs of each Air Force installa-
   tion may:
       3.2.4.1. Deny claims filed for $25,000 or less.
       3.2.4.2. Pay claims filed in any amount when payment is for $25,000 or less. EXCEPTION: See
       restrictions on settlement authority at paragraph 1.7.5.

3.3. Statute of Limitations. A claim must be presented in writing to the appropriate federal agency
within 2 years of accrual, unless the United States is at war or in an armed conflict when the claim
22                                                                      AFI51-501_ACC_I 29 JUNE 2006


accrues, or the United States enters a war or armed conflict after the claim accrues, and good cause is
shown. Congress or the President establishes the beginning and ending of an armed conflict.
     3.3.1. A claim normally accrues at the time of injury when essential operative facts are apparent.
     Apply the same rules governing accrual pursuant to the FTCA with respect to the MCA.
     3.3.2. In computing the statutory time period, the date of the incident is excluded and the date the
     claim is presented is included.

3.4. Who are Proper Claimants:
     3.4.1. Citizens and inhabitants of the United States. However, a person who is an inhabitant of a for-
     eign country, even if a citizen of the United States, is not a proper claimant under the MCA.
     3.4.2. US military personnel and federal civilian employees. EXCEPTION: US military personnel
     and federal civilian employees may not be paid under the MCA for personal injury or death incident
     to service.
     3.4.3. Foreign military personnel when the damage or injury occurs in the United States. EXCEP-
     TION: Foreign military personnel may not be paid under the MCA for personal injury or death inci-
     dent to service.

     while acting within the scope of their employment, unless an exclusion listed in paragraph 3.7.
     applies.
     3.6.1. (ACC) Negligent or Wrongful Act or Omission Claims. The Base Staff Judge Advocate will
     examine the claims to determine if military justice or civilian personnel action may be appropriate
     under the circumstances given rise to the claim.

   there is a willful or malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition, or unless consid-
   eration was paid to the United States (including a nonappropriated fund instrumentality) to use the
   premises.

3.8. Interpretation of the MCA: The meaning and construction of the MCA is a federal question to be
determined by federal law. Many of the exceptions to payment under the MCA are based upon the word-
ing of 28 U.S.C. 2680, or on other statutes or court cases. Federal case law interpreting the same exclusion
under the FTCA is applied to the MCA. Where state law differs with federal law, federal law prevails.

3.9. Applicable Law for Determining Liability under the MCA:
   3.9.1. For tort claims arising from negligent or wrongful acts or omissions, settlement authorities
   apply these rules:
26                                                                     AFI51-501_ACC_I 29 JUNE 2006


        3.9.1.1. When a claim arises in the United States or its territories or possessions, settlement
        authorities follow the law of the place where the alleged negligent or wrongful act or omission
        occurred.
        3.9.1.2. In claims arising in foreign countries, settlement authorities use the general principles of
        American tort law as evidenced by case law and standard legal publications to evaluate the liabil-
        ity of the United States. The following specific rules apply:
            3.9.1.2.1. Contributory or comparative negligence is interpreted and applied according to the
            place of the occurrence. In the unusual situation where foreign law governing contributory or
            comparative negligence does not exist, contributory negligence bars the claim.
            3.9.1.2.2. Foreign rules and regulations governing the operation of motor vehicles (rules of
            the road) are applied to the extent those rules are not specifically superseded or preempted by
            United States military traffic regulations.
        3.9.1.3. The principle of absolute or strict liability does not apply.
     3.9.2. For tort claims arising from noncombat activities, the claimant does not need to show negli-
     gence or fault, but must establish causation and damages.

3.10. Applicable Law for Damages:
     3.10.1. To measure damages in claims arising in the United States or its possessions, the settlement
     authority follows the law of the place where the alleged negligent or wrongful act or omission
     occurred.
     3.10.2. In claims arising in foreign countries, settlement authorities use the general principles of
     American tort law as evidenced by case law and standard legal publications to evaluate damages, and
     the following specific rules apply:
        3.10.2.1. Hedonic damages are not payable.
        3.10.2.2. The collateral source doctrine does not apply.
        3.10.2.3. Joint and several liability does not apply. Payment is made based only upon the portion
        of loss, damage, injury or death, which is attributable to the Armed Forces of the United States.
        3.10.2.4. Future economic losses must be discounted to present value after deducting for federal
        income taxes and, in cases of wrongful death, personal consumption.

3.11. Paying MCA Claims. Settlement authorities:
     3.11.1. Pay settlements of $100,000 or less, per claimant, from Air Force claims monies.
     3.11.2. Pay settlements exceeding $100,000 by paying the first $100,000, per claimant, with Air
     Force claims monies and sending the remainder to the Department of the Treasury for payment under
     31 U.S.C. 1304. See paragraph 1.16.

                                                 Chapter 4

                   INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT AND FOREIGN CLAIMS

Section 4A—Single Service Claims Responsibility (SSCR)

4.1. Scope of this Chapter. This chapter implements DoD Directive 5515.3, Settlement of Claims Under
10 U.S.C. 2733 and 2734, 18 August 1965; DoD Directive 5515.8, Single Service Assignment of Respon-
sibility for Processing of Claims, 9 June 1990; the FCA, 10 U.S.C. 2734; and the IACA, 10 U.S.C. 2734a
and 2734b.

4.2. Assignment of Single Service Claims Responsibility. DoD Directive 5515.8 assigns single service
claims responsibility under various applicable claims statutes for processing and settling claims against
the United States arising in foreign areas.
   4.2.1. Claims are settled in accordance with the regulations of the armed service which has single ser-
   vice claims responsibility.
   4.2.2. DoD Directive 5515.8 authorizes the General Counsel of DoD to change single service assign-
   ments, and to assign claims responsibility to an armed service for a country not previously assigned.
   Contact AFLSA/JACT if there are questions about the assignment for any particular country.

Section 4B—The International Agreement Claims Act

4.3. General Discussion. The IACA is the implementing act for the payment of claims under interna-
tional agreements including Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs) when there is a pro-rata sharing
arrangement. SOFAs are not self-executing, and without this act no payment could be made under the var-
ious international agreements to which the US is a party.

4.4. Reimbursement Authority. The SAF; TJAG; DJAG; Director, AFLSA/JAC; the Chief, AFLSA/
JACT; the Chief, International Torts Branch, AFLSA/JACT; and the SJAs of PACAF, USAFE, 3AF,
5AF, Lajes Field, and 9AF (for USCENTCOM) may:
   4.4.1. Reimburse a claim paid by the receiving State.
   4.4.2. Pay a pro rata share of a claim (e.g. payment of a share of a claim for non-military property of
   a receiving State).
   4.4.3. Object to any claim on a bill from the receiving State.

4.5. Claims Arising in a Foreign Country. If a third party claimant tries to present an international
agreement claim with the Air Force, direct that person to the appropriate receiving State office. If the Air
Force actually receives a claim, send it to the United States sending State office for delivery to the receiv-
ing State.
4.5. (ACC) Claims Arising in a Foreign Country. Claims personnel notify HQ ACC/JA of serious
incidents having the potential for large claims exceeding the local settlement authority, arising in a for-
eign country due to the acts of omission of US Air Force military or civilian personnel, by telephone, tele-
fax or other electronic means of information transmission.
28                                                                     AFI51-501_ACC_I 29 JUNE 2006


4.6. Claims Arising in the United States.
     4.6.1. Claimants may file tort claims arising from the acts or omissions of the military or civilian per-
     sonnel of another SOFA contracting party at any Air Force claims office.
     4.6.2. The installation with claims jurisdiction over the area where the incident arose:
        4.6.2.1. Investigates the claim, and prepares a claim file in accordance with Attachment 2.
        4.6.2.2. Sends the claim to AFLSA/JACT for review. AFLSA/JACT forwards the claim to the US
        Army Claims Service for adjudication (Army has single service claims responsibility for all
        SOFA claims arising in the US).

4.7. Claims Processing. When the Air Force has single service claims responsibility, the sending State
office:
     4.7.1. Coordinates with the receiving State office on claims investigations.
     4.7.2. Reviews receiving State bills to ensure that all paid claims properly fall within the agreement,
     and objects when the claims do not.
     4.7.3. Processes under the FCA those tort claims arising from the conduct of US personnel while act-
     ing outside of the scope of their official duties.
     4.7.4. Arranges for payment of the US' pro rata share of claims.

Section 4C—The Foreign Claims Act

4.8. General Discussion. The purpose of the FCA is to promote friendly relations with foreign countries
and their inhabitants by paying proper claimants for death, personal injury, or property damage, caused by
military members or civilian employees of the US Armed Forces, or arising out of the noncombat activi-
ties of such forces.

4.9. Settlement Authority. The SAF may deny or approve claims for any amount. For claims approved
for more than $100,000, the SAF reports the amount in excess of $100,000 to the Department of the Trea-
sury for payment.
     4.9.1. The TJAG; DJAG; and Director, AFLSA/JAC are foreign claims commissions (FCC), and

     Canada), and AFSOC (for USSOCOM) are FCCs who may:
        4.9.3.1. Deny claims of $50,000 or less.
AFI51-501_ACC_I 29 JUNE 2006                                                                             29


       4.9.3.2. Pay claims filed in any amount when payment is for $50,000 or less.
   4.9.4. The SJAs of the numbered air forces in PACAF and USAFE; the SJA of 12AF (for South
   America, Central America, and the Caribbean); and the SJAs of Lajes AB, Azores, and Patrick AFB,

       4.9.5.2. Pay claims filed in any amount when payment is for $25,000 or less.

4.10. Appointing FCCs. Any settlement authority in this section may appoint one or more subordinate
judge advocates or civilian attorneys as FCCs. The appointment will be in writing.

4.11. Statute of Limitations. A claimant must present a claim to the United States in writing (or orally if
based on local custom) within two years after it accrues. War or armed conflict does not toll the statute of
limitations. In computing the statutory time period, the date of the incident is excluded and the date the
claim is filed is included.

4.12. Who are Proper Claimants. Proper claimants include inhabitants of a foreign country who are:
   4.12.1. Foreign nationals.
   4.12.2. Foreign military personnel, for property damage or loss.
   4.12.3. US nationals, unless they reside in a foreign country primarily because they are: employed
   directly by the United States, or sponsored or accompanying such a person; or employed by a US
   civilian contractor to further the performance of a contract with the United States, or sponsored by or
   accompanying such a person.
   4.12.4. US corporations with a place of business in the country in which the claim arose.

criminal act clearly outside the scope of employment. EXCEPTION: Do not pay claims arising outside
the scope of employment resulting from the acts of local hire civilian employees, whether those persons
are indigenous or US citizens. However, claims arising from the operation of U.S. Armed Forces vehicles
or other U.S. Armed Forces equipment by local hire civilian employees are payable, provided that the
employer or owner of the vehicle or other equipment would be liable under local law in the circumstances
involved.

4.16. Claims Not Payable. A claim is not payable when it:
     4.16.1. Is waived under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Status of Forces Agreement
     (SOFA), or any similar treaty, or is cognizable under such treaty as a claim involving the performance
     of official duty or for which the United States is legally responsible under receiving State law, as in
     claims under Article VIII, paragraphs 1-5 of the NATO SOFA. However, AFLSA/JACT may autho-
     rize payment of a claim where the foreign government disputes its legal responsibilities and the claim-
     ant has no other means of compensation.

AFI51-501_ACC_I 29 JUNE 2006                                                                               31

   tody if the claim is otherwise payable.
   4.16.18. Is the subject of litigation against the United States or its employees. This restriction does

32                                                                    AFI51-501_ACC_I 29 JUNE 2006

     direct payments by a member or civilian employee of the US Armed Forces for damages (not solatia),
     and any payments recovered or recoverable from an insurance policy when premiums were paid,
     directly or indirectly, by the United States, or by a member or civilian employee of the US Armed
     Forces, or when the member or employee has the benefit of the insurance (e.g. US member or
     employee borrows a vehicle of a local national, and the vehicle carries insurance for the benefit of any
     driver with permission to drive the vehicle).

4.18. Rights of Subrogation, Indemnity, and Contribution. The Air Force has the rights of subroga-

     occurred. EXCEPTION: If the claimant is a foreign inhabitant of another country, payment may be
     made in the country of claimant’s residence or in some other currency in exceptional circumstances.
     Do not pay in a currency other than that of the country where the incident occurred without permission
     of AFLSA/JACT.
     4.19.2. Do not approve claims in a foreign currency that is the equivalent of US dollars on the date of
     exchange without permission of AFLSA/JACT.

Section 4D—Solatia

4.20. General Discussion. A solatium payment is a nominal payment made immediately to a victim or
the victim’s family to express sympathy, when local custom exists for such payments.

4.21. Settlement Authority. Solatia payments are made from the personal funds of a tortfeasor, or from
Operation and Maintenance appropriations (other than claims funds) by the military department or DoD
agency involved in an incident, regardless of the assignment of SSCR. The local commander determines
the appropriate amount if it is not specified in local regulations.

4.22. When To Pay. Solatia are known to be a custom in Japan, Korea and Thailand. In other countries,
the SJA consults AFLSA/JACT before the United States pays solatia. If claims personnel become aware
of another service making a solatium payment outside these three named countries, immediately report
the payment to AFLSA/JACT.

                                                 Chapter 5

         NONAPPROPRIATED FUND, AIR NATIONAL GUARD, CIVIL AIR PATROL,
                  ADMIRALTY, AND MISCELLANEOUS CLAIMS

Section 5A—General

5.1. Scope of this Chapter.
   5.1.1. This chapter contains procedures for settling:
       5.1.1.1. Nonappropriated fund instrumentality (NAFI) claims.
       5.1.1.2. Civil Air Patrol (CAP) claims.
       5.1.1.3. Claims under the NGCA, 32 U.S.C. 715.

       5.1.2.2. Under which statute the claim should be adjudicated.

Section 5B—Nonappropriated Fund Claims

5.2. Scope of this Section. This section implements DoD Directive 5515.6, Processing Tort, Contract
and Compensation Claims Arising Out of Operations of Nonappropriated Fund Activities, dated 3
November 1956.

5.3. Settling NAFI Claims. Settle NAFI claims in accordance with Chapter 2, Chapter 3, Chapter 4,
and Chapter 5.

5.4. Settlement Authority. The settlement authority for NAFI tort claims is the same as the authority
listed in the particular chapter of this instruction under which the Air Force settles claims alleging negli-
gence by appropriated fund employees (e.g. FTCA, MCA). However, claims are not sent to the Depart-
ment of the Treasury for payment. See paragraph 5.6. for payment of NAFI claims. The decision of the
settlement authority is binding upon the NAFI.

5.5. Notice of Claim. Upon receiving a NAFI tort claim, the claims office sends a copy of the claim to
Headquarters, Army and Air Force Exchange Service, General Counsel’s Office: HQ AAFES, P.O. Box
650062, ATTN: GC-G&C, Dallas TX 75265-0062; or to Headquarters, Air Force Services Agency,
34                                                                    AFI51-501_ACC_I 29 JUNE 2006


Office of Legal Counsel (AFSVA/SVL), 10100 Reunion PL, Ste 503, San Antonio, TX 78216-4138, as
appropriate.

5.6. Payment of Claims.
     5.6.1. Claims are paid from the fund source which pays the individual whose conduct gave rise to the
     claim.
        5.6.1.1. Only nonappropriated funds may be used to pay an administrative settlement, or a judg-
        ment resulting from a lawsuit, when the alleged negligent conduct was that of a nonappropriated
        fund employee.
        5.6.1.2. Settlement agreements for claims involving NAFIs contain a release of nonappropriated
        fund employees, as well as the United States of America, its agents, servants, and employees.
        5.6.1.3. Military personnel or appropriated fund civilian employees performing off-duty,
        part-time work, and receiving NAFI pay for their duties, are nonappropriated fund employees for
        claims arising out of their off-duty work.
     5.6.2. Claims involving errant golf balls.
        5.6.2.1. Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2246, appropriated funds may not be used to equip, operate or
        maintain golf courses in the United States (with limited exceptions). However, this does not man-
        date that all golf ball claims will be paid from nonappropriated funds.
        5.6.2.2. Settlement authorities decide each claim on a case-by-case basis. Liability for golf ball
        damage normally results from some hazardous condition that has gone uncorrected. Golf course
        and other NAFI employees have a responsibility to remediate known hazards. At the same time, if
        they take appropriate steps to remediate and are prevented from doing so by the action, inaction,
        or decisions of appropriated fund personnel (military or civilian), then they cannot be faulted for
        failing to correct a hazard.
            5.6.2.2.1. For example, if a NAFI golf course manager has knowledge of a dangerous condi-
            tion requiring netting, and fails to take action to get the netting, then any claim arising out of
            the failure is to be paid with nonappropriated funds. If the manager attempts to get the netting,
            but is not successful because the project is disapproved by the civil engineer, commander, or
            other appropriated fund official, then any such claim is to be paid with appropriated funds.
            5.6.2.2.2. Report to AFLSA/JACT and AFSVA/SVL any instances where NAFI personnel
            attempted to remedy a hazard and were prevented from doing so by appropriated fund person-
            nel.
     5.6.3. Send claims for payment involving the Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) to:
     HQ AAFES, ATTN: GC-Z/CC, P.O. Box 660602, Dallas, TX 75266-0202.
     5.6.4. Send claims for payment involving all other Air Force NAFIs to the following: For payments
     over $50.00, send to HQ AFSVA/SVXBC, 10100 Reunion Place, Ste. 502, San Antonio, Texas
     78216-4138. For payments of $50.00 and under, send to the local NAFI, which employs the NAFI
     employee whose conduct gave rise to the claim.

5.7. Claims Not Payable with Nonappropriated Funds:
AFI51-501_ACC_I 29 JUNE 2006                                                                           35


   5.7.1. Claims arising out of the operation of a NAFI activity which are caused by military personnel
   or appropriated fund civilian employees performing assigned Air Force duties, even though they ben-
   efit a NAFI activity.

   duties.

   5.7.5. Claims arising out of the activities of private organizations.
   5.7.6. Claims arising out of NAFI activities involving contract disputes, dishonored checks, debts to
   NAFIs, or third party workers’ compensation claims.

5.8. Customer Complaints. Complaints or claims for personal property loss or damage by NAFI cus-
tomers that the local NAFI activity can satisfactorily resolve should not be processed under this section.

5.9. NAFI Insurance Claims. AFLSA/JACT may settle claims arising out of the activities of the autho-

        period for filing suit under the Suits in Admiralty Act or the Public Vessels Act.
        5.28.1.3. Filing an administrative claim prior to suit is required only when the damage or injury to

Section 5F—Use of Government Property Claims Act

5.32. Scope of this Section. This section implements 10 U.S.C. 2737, and explains how to settle claims
against the United States for property damage, personal injury, or death incident to the use of a govern-
ment vehicle, or by the use of any other government property on a government installation, when the
claim is not payable under any other statute. Claims may be paid under this section whether or not the

within 2 years of accrual, unless the United States is at war or in an armed conflict when the claim
accrues, or the United States enters a war or armed conflict after the claim accrues, and good cause is
shown. Congress or the President establish the beginning and ending of an armed conflict.
     5.39.1. A claim normally accrues at the time of injury when essential operative facts are apparent.
     5.39.2. In computing the statutory time period, the date of the incident is excluded and the date the
     claim is presented is included.

5.41. Payable Claims. Losses of household effects sustained during a move made incident to a perma-
nent change of station when, as determined by the SAF, the loss was caused by a hostile action incident to

operations, or combat training.
Air National Guard (ANG)—The federally recognized Air National Guard of each state, the District of
Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam. ANG Duty Status is of three
types: (1) active federal service; (2) federally funded training; or (3) state duty. In active federal service,
ANG members may serve on active federal duty under Title 10 to augment the active Air Force under
certain circumstances or for certain types of duty or training. During federally funded training, ANG
members perform specified federally funded training under Title 32 such as: weekend drills; annual
training; field exercises; range firing; military schooling; full-time unit support; and recruiting duties.
State duty is that which the governor of the state requires and pays for with state funds.
ANG Members—Military personnel of the ANG who perform duty under 32 U.S.C. 316, 502, 503, 504,
or 505, for which they receive pay from the United States or waive pay from the United States.
ANG Technicians—Federal employees employed under 32 U.S.C. 709. A technician who is not
employed under 32 U.S.C. 709 is a state employee.
Appeal—Under the MCA, NGCA and 10 U.S.C. 2738, a request by the claimant to reevaluate the final
agency action on the claim.

provides exchange and motion picture services to authorized patrons.
Authorized Agent—Any person or corporation, including a legal representative, with the authority to act
on a claimant's behalf.
CAP Members—Private citizens who volunteer their time, services, and resources to meet CAP
objectives and purposes. The two primary categories of members are cadets and seniors. Cadets are
youths, 13 years (or having satisfactorily completed the sixth grade) through 17 years of age, who meet
the requirements set by the CAP corporation. Cadets may keep their status until age 21. Seniors are adults,
18 years of age or older, who meet the requirements set by the CAP corporation, and who have not kept
their cadet status.
Civil Air Patrol—A federally chartered, civilian nonprofit corporation which is designated as a
volunteer civilian auxiliary of the Air Force.
46                                                                  AFI51-501_ACC_I 29 JUNE 2006


Civilian Component—Civilian personnel accompanying and employed by an international agreement
contracting force. Local employees, contractor employees, or members of the American Red Cross are
not a part of the civilian component unless specifically included in the agreement.
Civilian Personnel—Civilian employees of the US Government who are paid from appropriated or
nonappropriated funds. Civilian employees may include volunteer workers.
Claim—Any signed, written demand made upon or by the Air Force for the payment of a specific sum. It
does not include any obligations that the Air Force acquires in the regular procurement of services,
supplies, equipment, or real estate. Under the FCA, a claim need not be in writing if that is the custom of
the country in which the incident occurred.
Contracting Party—A nation signing the governing international agreement.
Final Denial—A letter from the settlement authority to claimant, his or her attorney, or legal
representative sent by certified or registered mail advising that the Air Force denies the claim.
Force—Personnel belonging to the land, sea, or air armed services of one contracting party when in the
territory of another contracting party in connection with their official duties.
Foreign Claims Commission—The claims settlement authority under the Foreign Claims Act. Under the
FCA, only Foreign Claims Commissions (FCCs) or the Secretary may settle claims. The Secretary
concerned or designee appoints FCCs.
Geographic Area of Claims Responsibility—An SJA's jurisdiction for claims. As authorized by TJAG,
AFLSA/JACC assigns CONUS claims areas. The SJAs of HQ PACAF, HQ USAFE, and HQ 9AF (for
USCENTCOM) designate the areas within their jurisdictions. The DoD assigns areas of single service
responsibility to each military department.
Inhabitant of a Foreign Country—A person, corporation, or other business association whose usual
place of abode is in a foreign country. The term "inhabitant" has a broader meaning than such terms as
"citizen" or "national," but does not include persons who are merely temporarily present in a foreign
country. The term does not require foreign citizenship or permanent, legal residence. Members of the US
Military are not considered inhabitants of a foreign country. Whether dependents of US Military
personnel are considered inhabitants of a foreign country is determined on a case by case basis.
Legally Responsible—A term of art providing for settlement of claims under cost sharing international
agreements in accordance with the law of the receiving State. Often, employees who are local inhabitants,
not part of the civilian component of the force, could cause the sending State to be legally responsible
under a respondeat superior theory.
Maritime Tort—A tort committed in navigable waters or on land or in the air where a substantial
element of the damage, personal injury, or death occurred in or over navigable waters. The activity
causing the tortious act must bear some significant relationship to traditional maritime activity.
Morale, Welfare, Recreation, and Services (MWRS) Activities—Activities operated directly or by
contract, which provide programs to promote the morale and well being of the Air Force's military and
civilian personnel and their dependents which are funded wholly with appropriated funds, primarily with
nonappropriated funds, or with a combination of appropriated and nonappropriated funds.
Nonappropriated Funds—Funds that DoD military and civilian personnel and their dependents
generate and that the DoD uses in addition to congressionally appropriated funds to provide a
AFI51-501_ACC_I 29 JUNE 2006                                                                              47


comprehensive morale building, welfare, religious, educational, and recreational program, designed to
improve the well being of military and civilian personnel and their dependents.
Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentality—A federal government instrumentality established to
generate and administer nonappropriated funds for programs and services for the morale and well being
of authorized personnel.
Noncombat Activity—A term of art which is defined as activity, other than combat, war, or armed
conflict, that is particularly military in nature, has little parallel in civilian pursuits, and has been
historically considered as furnishing the proper basis for payable claims. “Noncombat activity” should not
be interpreted as simply meaning, “not combat.”
Receiving State—The country where the force or civilian component of another contracting party is
temporarily located. It is often thought of as the “host nation.”
Reconsideration Authority—Under claims statutes, which do not grant the right of appeal, the
individual (determined by job title) who makes the final determination regarding a claim for which
reconsideration has been requested.
Recreational Purpose—The use of recreational facilities for the enjoyment of people, including, but not
limited to, activities such as fishing, hunting, camping, ball playing, golf, water sports, beach activities,
hiking, animal riding, off-road vehicle riding, bicycling, skating, skate-boarding, picnicking, sledding,
skiing, and visiting or photographing historical, archeological, scenic, natural, and scientific sites.
Sending State—The country sending the force or civilian component to the receiving State. In cases
where US personnel are stationed in a foreign country, the United States is the sending State.
Settle—To consider, ascertain, adjust, determine, and dispose of a claim, whether by full or partial
allowance or by disallowance.
Settlement Authority—The individual or Foreign Claims Commission (for claims under the FCA) who
has the authority under this instruction to pay or deny a claim. An individual occupying an office in an
“acting” capacity has the settlement authority of that office.
Third Parties—A term of art used in International Agreements. Third parties are parties other than
members of the force and civilian component of the sending or receiving States. Dependents, tourists, and
other noninhabitants of a foreign country are third parties (and therefore can generally make a claim under
a SOFA) unless the international agreement, or an understanding between the countries involved,
specifically excludes them.
