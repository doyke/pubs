This instruction implements AFPD 36-21, Utilization and Classification of Air Force Military Personnel.
It outlines and establishes policy, procedures, areas of responsibilities, and an events timeline for the
AETC squadron commanders board. It applies to all personnel involved with nominations, board process,
selection, and protocol. This publication does not apply to the Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve
Command. Attachment 1 contains a glossary of references and supporting information. Ensure all
records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with
AFMAN 37-123, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://webrims.amc.af.mil.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
The information in this instruction has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.
Primary changes include a transition from two AETC HAWK boards per year to one board per year and
the elimination of the AETC Recruiting and Training Squadron Commander Candidate Selection Board.


1. Purpose:
   1.1. The selection of AETC squadron commanders is important business. The goal is to give com-
   manders at all levels the tools to choose from the best talent available.
   1.2. The HAWK board convenes annually in October to identify candidates for projected vacancies in
   flying squadron commander billets, operational support squadron commander billets, chiefs of safety,
   and other requirements directed by the AETC Commander (AETC/CC). Candidates may also be
   selected as operations officers based on projected future command vacancies.
   1.3. Per CSAF-approved force development initiatives, AETC recruiting squadron (RS) and training
   squadron (TRS) commander billets are now filled from HQ AFPC calendar year support squadron
2                                                               AETCI36-2111 16 NOVEMBER 2004


    commander development team (DT) meetings. Paragraph 13. covers how to bid on candidates for
    vacancies in RS and TRS commander vacancies.
    1.4. HQ AETC/SGAW is the MAJCOM staff OPR for medical and dental squadron commander
    issues.

2. HAWK Board Participants:
    2.1. The 19 AF/CC, who acts as HAWK board president on behalf of AETC/CC, is a nonvoting board
    member.
    2.2. The 19 AF/CV and HQ AETC/ADO attend as voting board members. Additional voting board
    members include wing commanders (or the designated representative of each HQ AETC organization
    with a rated squadron commander billet), 336 TRG/CC, and 479 FTG/CC. The 81 TRW is excused
    from providing a rated officer.
    2.3. Designated board members not available to attend the board will request approval to allow a
    qualified officer from their organization to participate on their behalf. Substitutions will be in the
    grade of colonel or above. Requests will be indorsed by the senior rater and forwarded to HQ AETC/
    DPAOD, who will forward the request to the board president for approval.
    2.4. When approved by 19 AF/CC, other organizations may be added to the board membership or
    identified as nonvoting technical advisors. Requests will be staffed through HQ AETC/DPAOD.

3. Timelines:
    3.1. Ninety days prior to the board, HQ AETC/DPAOD will confirm the board location.
    3.2. The announcement message will be released at least 60 days prior to the board.
    3.3. The suspense date for nominations will be 30 days prior to the board. Nominations must be com-
    plete as defined in paragraph 4. and mailed in time for receipt by the established suspense date.
    3.4. Prior to the board, HQ AETC/DPA will personally brief the board process to the board president.
    3.5. The board president will confirm the board results; and then the AETC/CC will approve and
    release the results.

4. Nomination Packages:
    4.1. Candidates may be nominated by AETC wing commanders or higher and by wing commanders,
    their equivalents, or higher-ranking officials from other commands. Candidate nominations will be
    consolidated and submitted as one package per senior rater. For an individual serving in a staff capac-
    ity, the nomination package will be reviewed and indorsed by the personnel function (DP or J-1) and
    the staff director or civilian equivalent in the nominee's chain of command will indorse and submit the
    nomination package.
    4.2. Nomination packages will be forwarded to HQ AETC/DPAOD, 1850 First Street West, Suite 1,
    Randolph AFB TX 78150-4308, in accordance with the timelines provided in paragraphs 3. and 12.,
    as applicable. Failure to submit nominations by the published suspense date will be presumed a nega-
    tive input.
    4.3. Nomination packages will consist of:
AETCI36-2111 16 NOVEMBER 2004                                                                              3


       4.3.1. AF Form 10A, Personnel Information File, Record of Performance, Officer Command
       Selection Record Group (Folder). Non-AETC candidate nominations should be in a two-section
       record jacket.
       4.3.2. AF IMT 3849, PME/AFIT/RTFB Officer Worksheet. This worksheet will be prepared on
       each candidate by the wing commander and filed in Section I of the nominee's board record (AF
       Form 10A). Officers may indicate type of squadron and location preferences on their AF IMT
       3849. Officers must understand they are volunteers to command at any location.
       4.3.3. A complete copy of each nominee's top five officer performance reports (OPR) (non-AETC
       nominees only). These OPRs will be filed in Section II of the nominee's board record (AF Form
       10A).
       4.3.4. A copy of AF IMT 942, Record of Evaluation (for the HAWK board only). This document
       will be filed in Section I of the nominee's board record (AF Form 10A).
   4.4. HQ AETC/DPAOD will provide the names and social security numbers (SSN) of nominees
   already assigned to HQ AETC to HQ AETC/DPSPR no later than 20 days prior to the board to allow
   command records to be pulled and screened.

5. Eligibility. All eligible officers must:
   5.1. Be Line of the Air Force (LAF) officers on active duty.
   5.2. For the HAWK board, be in the grade of lieutenant colonel (or have a line number to lieutenant
   colonel) and not be in the primary zone for promotion to colonel during a normal 2-year command
   tour.
   5.3. For RS and TRS commander positions, be a major-select or be in the grade of major or lieutenant
   colonel and not be in the primary zone for promotion to colonel during a normal 2-year command
   tour.
   5.4. Not have applied for separation or retirement.
   5.5. If rated and currently in a joint billet, have served 22 months (to the day) prior to departing for a
   flying squadron command. Support officers or rated officers selected for nonflying command who are
   currently serving in a joint billet must serve 24 months (to the day) prior to departing for a squadron
   command.
   5.6. Be available to assume command in the window of assignment selection. The date eligible for
   return from overseas and time on station are not board-eligibility limiters, but they factor into the
   assignment process.
   5.7. For the HAWK board, have not previously commanded an operational squadron. The nominating
   official will submit an exception request to the board president for approval by the nomination sus-
   pense date.
   5.8. For the HAWK board, have flown within the last 5 years from the board date (rated officers).
   Nonrated officers holding an Air Force specialty code (AFSC) of 13MX, 14NX, or 15WX are eligible
   for operational support squadron billets.
4                                                                AETCI36-2111 16 NOVEMBER 2004


6. Board Location. The HQ AETC squadron commander board will convene in the HQ AETC Com-
mand Conference Center (Building 905). If the center is not available, HQ AETC/DPAOD will identify
an alternate location on Randolph AFB (with the board president's approval).

7. Board Support:
    7.1. HQ AETC/DPA is the OPR for the HQ AETC squadron commander board.
    7.2. HQ AETC/DPAOD is responsible for determining projected command vacancies, announcing
    the board, processing nominations, administering the board, announcing candidates, making copies of
    command records (for nominees assigned to AETC), and destroying duplicates records at the conclu-
    sion of the board.

8. Board Records. Board records will be composed of each officer's top five OPRs, single uniform
retrieval format (SURF), and an AF IMT 3849 completed specifically for the board.

9. Identifying Quotas:
    9.1. HQ AETC/DPAOD will identify projected assignment vacancies for board consideration.
    9.2. Normally, two eligible candidates will be selected for each projected vacancy. For example, if 8
    positions are expected to open, 16 candidates will be selected. If the board president decides to adjust
    this ratio, he or she will do so before record scoring begins.
    9.3. Based on mission requirements, the board president may indicate that specific qualifications are
    necessary for a specific number of candidates. (For example, on a HAWK board, a certain number of
    helicopter pilots may be required.) He or she will identify these special requirements to board mem-
    bers before record scoring begins.
    9.4. To allow a few rated officers the opportunity to be RS or TRS commanders, RS or TRS com-
    mander billet quotas should be factored in as projected vacancies on the HAWK board, normally
    determined by the number of graduating rated RS or TRS squadron commanders. Direct hire of rated
    officers to become RS or TRS commanders will be worked on a case-by-case basis with HQ AETC/
    DPA (paragraph 12.4).

10. Scoring:
    10.1. HQ AETC/DPAOD will provide cover sheets and score sheets on each nominee to ensure each
    board member has an opportunity to review and score each record.
    10.2. Scoring will be based on a scale from 6.0 to 10.0 in half-point increments.
    10.3. Board members will review all records presented to the board.
    10.4. Records will be scored electronically.
    10.5. In the event board member ratings result in a split score that impacts candidate selections, the
    board members responsible for those scores will rescore the record to resolve the split. The board
    president will determine split criteria.
    10.6. In the event of a tie impacting candidate selection, all board members will rescore the affected
    records to resolve the tie.
AETCI36-2111 16 NOVEMBER 2004                                                                            5


   10.7. Those selected will be rank ordered and a cutoff line drawn at the predetermined quota (para-
   graph 9.1.). If a vacancy exists in a specific category (for example, helicopter pilots) and the pool of
   qualified officers is below the allowed quota, the board president may bring forward the first qualified
   nonselect to meet the requirement. In such a situation, the quality and reflective score of the eligible
   officer should be considered prior to selection.

11. Disclosure of Board Proceedings, Findings, and/or Results. The score given any particular record
is privileged information and will not be disclosed. However, there is no prohibition on disclosing infor-
mation on the overall numbers considered, manner in which the board was organized, general procedures
followed, or number and grade of the board's membership. NOTE: Board results may not be released until
after the AETC/CC has approved and released the corresponding board candidate message.

12. RS and TRS Commander Positions:
   12.1. AETC RS and TRS squadron commander billets will be primarily filled by the support squad-
   ron commander DT selection process managed by HQ AFPC/DPAS, as follows:
       12.1.1. HQ AETC/DPAOD will notified HQ AFPC/DPAS of projected RS and TRS commander
       vacancies. HQ AFPC/DPAS will identify AETC RS and TRS commander vacancies to DTs and
       advertise, via message, eligibility criteria and nomination procedures to eligible officers.
       12.1.2. Nominees for RS and TRS commander positions will annotate their desires on their tran-
       sitional-officer development plan (T-ODP) and complete a statement of intent (SOI), DTs will
       review the T-ODPs and SOIs and make recommendations. Candidates will be published on the
       HQ AFPC consolidated support squadron commander candidate list.
       12.1.3. Upon release of the candidate list, HQ AETC/DPA will work with the Air Force Recruit-
       ing Service Commander (AFRS/CC), Air University Commander (AU/CC), and numbered Air
       Force commanders (NAF/CC) to assist with the bid process (including conflicts). HQ AETC/DPA
       will then forward a consolidated list of bids to HQ AFPC for final resolution.
   12.2. RS and TRS commander positions are nonrated positions. Hiring authorities may bid on rated
   officers from MAJCOM-rated candidate lists. However, due to the rated officer shortage, release by
   HQ AFPC will be on a case-by-case basis for MAJCOM entitlements specified in the HQ USAF/XO
   rated prioritization plan.

13. Hiring Process:
   13.1. HQ AETC/DPA will assist wing and group commanders to fill projected vacancies in all HQ
   AETC squadrons and other requirements as directed by the AETC/CC. HQ AFPC central selection
   boards, MAJCOM selection boards, and direct hires will be used to help commanders choose the best
   talent available.
   13.2. HQ AETC/DPA will coordinate squadron commander assignments with the corresponding HQ
   AFPC functional manager. Optimal placement in meeting Air Force needs is the prime objective.
   13.3. Wing and group commanders may request the direct hire of a candidate from any MAJCOM or
   HQ AFPC squadron commander candidate list. (See Attachment 2 for the format for a direct hire
   request.) The process must be initiated by the wing commander or equivalent (senior rater); indorsed
   by the AFRS/CC, AU/CC, or NAF/CC; and forwarded to HQ AETC/DPA. Direct hire requests may
   be scanned and/or e-mailed to HQ AETC/DPA. (Pass all direct hire requests through the NAF/DP to
6                                                                  AETCI36-2111 16 NOVEMBER 2004


    obtain NAF/CC approval.) HQ AETC/DPA will coordinate the assignment through HQ AFPC and
    gaining and losing MAJCOMs. (See Attachment 3 for the hiring process flowchart.)
    13.4. For rated officers, direct hires may only be made against projected vacant flying squadron com-
    mander (C-prefix) and chief of safety billets. In addition, an entitlement with the appropriate AFSC
    must exist in the unit. For example, if the requester desires to direct hire a fighter pilot, the unit must
    have a fighter pilot authorization and entitlement. The direct hire process does not apply to detach-
    ments, flights, centers, and staffs even if the position has a C-prefix.
    13.5. Wing and group commanders will take into account the long lead time required to ensure a rated
    officer is ready to assume command of a flying squadron. Bids and game plans will be sent through 19
    AF/CC as early as possible to ensure required training and assignment coordination is completed.
    13.6. The HAWK list will be used to fill projected vacancies for the following entire calendar year.
    13.7. In rare cases, wing commanders may hire candidates not listed on any squadron commander list.
    Hiring authorities will forward requests through the AFRS/CC, AU/CC, or NAF/CC (as applicable) to
    HQ AETC/DPA. HQ AETC/DPA will forward these requests to AETC/CC for approval. (See the hir-
    ing process flowchart at Attachment 3.) These requests should be in the proper electronic staff sum-
    mary sheet (ESSS) format to speed up processing through the NAF and HQ AETC staff. (See
    Attachment 4 and Attachment 5 for ESSS format examples.) These requests must include a strong
    justification. They must also state that remaining boarded candidates were considered for the job.
    13.8. New commanders will attend the AETC Squadron Commanders Course prior to their change of
    command. The AETC Vice Commander (AETC/CV) may waive this requirement, but the new com-
    mander must attend the course within 3 months of assuming command. Even if the new commander
    has attended another MAJCOM's course, he or she still must attend the AETC Squadron Commanders
    Course. The waiver request should be in an approved ESSS format with the proper coordination anno-
    tated. (See Attachment 4 for the format for a waiver request.)
       13.8.1. HQ AETC/DPAOD will process all waivers to course attendance for LAF officers; HQ
       AETC/SGAW will process all waivers to course attendance for medical commanders.
       13.8.2. HQ AETC/DPX is the OPR for the AETC Squadron Commanders Course. Course atten-
       dance for new commanders must be scheduled with HQ AETC/DPXE.

14. Command Tour Length:
    14.1. To give commanders the opportunity to make their mark and prove themselves in command, the
    standard command tour length will be a minimum of 2 years (plus or minus 60 days). For contracting
    squadrons, the standard tour length is 3 years (plus or minus 60 days).
    14.2. If a wing or equivalent commander desires to move commanders early or extend them, he or she
    will forward a request through the AFRS/CC, AU/CC, or NAF/CC, as appropriate, to HQ AETC/
    DPA. In turn, HQ AETC/DPA will forward the request to AETC/CV for approval/disapproval. The
    waiver request should be submitted in the HQ AETC-approved ESSS format (Attachment 5). The
    ESSS should also identify a backfill candidate. Both actions may be accomplished on the same ESSS.
    Joint flying squadron command positions that rotate with sister services or NATO countries on less
    than a 2-year basis do not require an AETC/CV-approved waiver.
    14.3. HQ AETC/DPAOD will process command tour length waivers for LAF officers; HQ AETC/
    SGAW will process these waivers for all medical commanders.
