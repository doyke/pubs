3. General Program Information. Vandenberg AFB will have one CBB each quarter
consisting of all nominees from all of the small units on the base. There will not be separate
boards for each MAJCOM represented on base.
   3.1. SrA BTZ Promotion Boards are held the last month of each quarter (Mar, Jun, Sep,
   Dec).
   3.2. Individuals in AFSCs 1C2X1 and 1T2X1 are eligible for BTZ consideration IAW
   MPFM 06-57.

4                                                               30SWI36-2501 23 JUNE 2009


    3.4. A projected BTZ promotion cannot be placed in withhold status. If the squadron
    commander determines a quality indicator of any kind has been identified, he/she can non-
    recommend the member for promotion and the first alternate can be promoted in the original
    selectee’s place if the 30 SW/CC concurs with the request (CBB only). If the member is
    from a large unit board, the unit board president may make a recommendation to the unit
    commander to request the alternate receives the promotion. If the request is approved, the
    large unit board president must resubmit BTZ meeting minutes to 30 FSS/FSMPPE as soon
    as the request is approved.
4. Quotas. Quotas are based on 15 percent of the total TIG and TIS eligible population listed on
Parts I and II of the quarterly BTZ roster (remove students and World Class Athletes from the
eligible population) (do not include members listed on Part III in the eligible population). The
MPF/CC determines, approves and distributes quotas to units. Quotas are computed and
distributed as follows:
Computation: Eligibles multiplied by 15 percent equals the quota
Example: 13 eligibles x 0.15 = 1.95, or 2 BTZ quotas
(Note: Fractions of 0.5 or higher are rounded up)

30SWI36-2501 23 JUNE 2009                                                                     5


       6.1.2. Three voting board members will be appointed by the board president. Each CBB
       will consist of one First Sergeant, one Senior NCO from an associate unit and one 30 SW
       Senior NCO.
       6.1.3. A non-voting recorder appointed by 30 FSS/FSMP in the enlisted grade of SrA or
       higher.
   6.2. Boards held by large units will consist of the following:
       6.2.1. The board president as determined IAW paragraph 2.5. He/she will coordinate
       with the unit commander and determine if the board will be “records only” or face-to-
       face and will appoint the following:
          6.2.2.1. Three voting board members in the enlisted grade of Technical Sergeant or
          higher.
          6.2.2.2. A non-voting recorder in the enlisted grade of SrA or above.
7. Selection Folders.
   7.1. Commanders of small units are responsible for providing 30 FSS/FSMPPE a selection
   folder for all CBB nominees. Each folder includes AF Form 1206, decorations, and a letter
   signed by the squadron commander indicating the member has a current fitness test with a
   score of 75 or above. Actual fitness scores will not be given to the board.
   7.2. The MPF will order a BTZ RIP and organize each board members’ folder IAW
   Attachment 7.
8. Scoring Process.
   8.1. The selection folders will be scored using quarter-point increments, with the following
   maximum values per area: Leadership and Job Performance in Primary Duty (9 points),
   Significant Self Improvement (3 points), and Base and Community Involvement (3 points).
   The scores will be recorded on the score sheet at Attachment 5. After the packages are
   scored, the board members will rank order the nominees. With the exception of the CBB
   President’s scores, the board member’s rank order scores will be added together for a
   composite board score using the score sheet at Attachment 4. The eligible members will
   then be sorted in order of merit from the lowest composite board score to the highest.
   (Equivalent electronic databases maybe used in place of these two attachments referenced in
   this paragraph).
   8.2. If the board is face-to-face, board members will rate each nominee based on the
   following: accuracy of answers to question(s), dress and appearance, bearing, and
   communication skills on a 6-point scale. Each board member will only score his/her own
   question, but should use the entire interview to come up with the overall score. These scores
   will then be added to the selection folder scores on the score sheet and sorted IAW paragraph
   8.1.
   8.3. In the event of a tie score, the CBB President will break the tie.
   8.4. Face-to-Face BTZ boards will consist of no more than one question from each of the
   following areas (Chapter references are taken from the Professional Development Guide,
   unless otherwise stated): Dress and Appearance (Chap 17), Military Customs and Courtesies
   (Chap 8), Profession of Arms (Chap 9, Section D), General or Specific Airmen
6                                                                30SWI36-2501 23 JUNE 2009


    Responsibilities (AFPAM 36-2618), Enlisted History (Chap 2), Leadership (Chap 10), Air
    Force Doctrine (Chap 4), Emergency Management Program (Chap 5), Fit Force (Chap 18),
    and current events. Each board member will be assigned to ask one fact and one opinion
    question each.
9. Processing Errors.
    9.1. Prior to announcement. If a member should have been considered during the current
    quarter board and the error is discovered before promotions are announced, large unit
    commanders will consider the member and adjust selections accordingly (this does not apply
    to members who are gained, and it has been determined they were not considered by their
    losing base; see supplemental BTZ consideration). The CBB will reconvene to consider
    small unit eligibles and adjust selections accordingly.
    9.2. After announcement. If a member should have been considered during the current
    board and the error is discovered after selections are announced, supplemental promotion
    consideration procedures apply (see paragraph 10.). Adjustments will not be made to the
    gaining unit/base quota if the error is discovered and a member should have been considered
    by his/her losing base. Every effort should be made to ensure the member is considered by
    the losing unit/base. If the losing unit/base has already announced selections, supplemental
    consideration (with current commander recommendation) should be requested by the gaining
    base.
10. Supplemental BTZ Consideration.
    10.1. Commanders may request supplemental BTZ consideration for members that should
    have been considered by a previous board and the error was not discovered until after
    promotions were announced. After obtaining unit commander’s recommendation, the MPF
    forwards fully documented supplemental requests to HQ AFPC/DPPPWM for consideration
    via e-mail. It is imperative supplemental BTZ consideration is requested only when the unit
    commander concurs with consideration. Additionally, if the basis for the supplemental
    request is because the member did not receive fair consideration (or was not considered at all
    at their last duty station), contact the losing unit and MPF before requesting supplemental
    consideration, and forward all correspondence along with the supplemental request. This
    will assist HQ AFPC/ DPPPWM in determining if supplemental BTZ consideration is
    appropriate. HQ AFPC/ DPPPWM will respond with further instructions. If selected,
    members may apply for a retroactive change to his/her effective date according to AFI 36-
    2502, Para 1.13.
    10.2. It is the responsibility of the member, supervisor and commander to ensure proper
    identification as an eligible, nomination IAW program policies, and verification of the data
    on the BTZ RIP prior to the board. Supplemental consideration will not be given for the
    following reasons:
       10.2.1. Incorrect data reflected on the BTZ RIP.
       10.2.2. Denied BTZ nomination due to incorrect data reflected on the BTZ RIP or in the
       UPRG.
       10.2.3. BTZ eligibility listing not returned to 30 FSS/FSMP or individual was
       overlooked and not considered.
30SWI36-2501 23 JUNE 2009                                                                  7


       10.2.4. Nomination package, AF Form 2096, Classification/On-The-Job Training
       Action, or decoration was not completed, submitted and/or approved in time to meet the
       board.
11. Notification Process.
   11.1. Small Units. Once the board report is approved by 30 SW/CC, 30 FSS/FSMP will
   notify squadron commanders or designated representatives of the results for release. Unit
   commanders with a selectee(s) will provide a written promotion recommendation letter to 30
   FSS/FSMP prior to the promotion effective date. This may be accomplished by adding the
   name(s) to the monthly promotion selectees listing or completing a separate memorandum.
   11.2. Large Units. Upon conclusion of the board, unit commander will notify the member
   and provide a written promotion recommendation letter to 30 FSS/FSMP prior to the
   promotion effective date. As with the small unit process, this may be accomplished by
   adding the name(s) to the monthly promotion selectees’ listing or by completing a separate
   memorandum.

                                  BOARD INSTRUCTIONS

A2.1. Approximately two days prior to the CBB convening date, each board member will
receive a BTZ folder with the information outlined in (paragraph 7 and Attachment 7) of this
instruction. If time allows, the board members will meet to discuss scoring approaches and to
validate completion of the packages
A2.2. Prior to the board date, each board member will independently assign a score up to 15
points to each nominee using quarter-point increments, with the following maximum values per
area: Leadership and Job Performance in Primary Duty (9 points), Significant Self Improvement
(3 points), and Base and Community Involvement (3 points). The scores will be recorded on the
score sheet at Attachment 5. After the packages are scored, the board members will rank order
the nominees.
A2.3. Board Proceedings.
   A2.3.1. The board president will monitor the entire board process and advise the board
   members on all proceedings.
   A2.3.2. The board president will administer the oath to voting board members and the non-
   voting recorder.
   A2.3.3. If there is a face-to-face board, the board will be conducted and board members will
   rate the package and the interview using the score sheet at Attachment 5.
   A2.3.4. The board recorder will collect score sheets and compile a composite board score
   using the score sheet at Attachment 4. The board recorder will then sort the eligible
   members in order of merit from the one with the highest score to the lowest.
   A2.3.5. Board members will not discuss individual nominees’ scores until after the
   composite board score is completed using Attachment 4. This ensures each board member
   scores the record independently and fairly.
   A2.3.6. If the board is scoring 1-5 nominees, the board recorder will identify any record,
   which has been rank ordered with a difference of more than two points between any of the
   board members (e.g. 1, 3, 3, 4). If the board is scoring 6-10 nominees, the recorder will
   identify any record with a difference of more than three points, and if the board is scoring the
   record of 11 or more nominees, the recorder will identify any record with a difference of
   more than four points. This process is required only if the discrepancy causes an issue with
   the outcome of the recipient(s) of the stripe(s). These discrepancies are termed a split vote
   and will be returned to the board for resolution. At this point, all board members will discuss
   the record openly among themselves regarding their reasoning. Following the discussion,
   board members will rescore and rank order the packages. This ensures consistency of
   scoring and eliminates the possibility that the action of any one board member will have a
   major impact, either positive or negative, on any individual’s board score.
