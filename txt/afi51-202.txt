been changed to reflect metrics that measure the time period between the date of the discovery of
the offense and the offer of the Article 15 and the offer date to the completion of the NJP action.
Paragraph 3.5. (Providing Evidence to the Member) clarifies that the member’s defense counsel
has a right to examine the evidence considered by the member’s commander. Paragraph 3.13.3.
clarifies that nonjudicial punishment proceedings can be made public during the offer portion of
the process, with the member’s consent. Paragraph 3.17. clarifies that a commander must select
one or more punishment options if he or she finds that NJP is appropriate.

This interim change also implements new guidance, contained in paragraph 5.11.3, allowing for
the notification of vacation proceedings by the commander who recommended that another
commander impose nonjudicial punishment. With the addition of new paragraph 5.11.3, what
were formerly paragraphs 5.11.3 and 5.11.4 have been renumbered as 5.11.4 and 5.11.5,
respectively. The addresses contained in paragraphs 6.8.1 and 6.8.2 have been updated. The
term ―specified commands‖ has been added to paragraphs 2.2.2, 2.2.5, 2.2.9, 2.5, and 4.2.5.

What was formerly paragraph 6.14 (Authority) has been transferred to paragraph 1.7. What were
formerly paragraphs 6.15 (Host Command Jurisdiction), 6.15.1, 6.15.2, 6.15.3 and 6.15.3.1 have
been transferred to paragraph 2.4 (Host Command Jurisdiction), 2.4.1, 2.4.2, 2.4.3 and 2.4.3.1,
respectively. What were formerly paragraphs 2.4 (Nonjudicial Punishment Authority in a Joint
Force), 2.5 (Procedures for Imposing Nonjudicial Punishment in a Joint Force), 2.6 (Procedures
for Multiservice Commanders), 2.7 (Delegation of Authority), 2.8 (Commander as Victim), 2.9
(Air Force Cadets), and 2.10 (Withholding Authority) become paragraphs 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9,
2.10 and 2.12, respectively, with the same headings. What were formerly paragraphs 6.16 and
6.16.1 have been transferred to paragraph 2.13 and combined into a single paragraph (Exceptions
to Support Agreements). What was formerly paragraph 6.16.2 has been transferred to paragraph
2.11 (Air Force Legal Operations Agency). Attachment 3 has been deleted. Paragraph 3 of
Attachment 4 (Sample Format for Notification of Change of Commander) has been modified to
include sample language for informing a member when his or her acknowledgement is due.

Throughout this interim change, references to ―AFLSA‖ have been changed to ―AFLOA‖ to
reflect the current acronym of the Air Force Legal Operations Agency. In addition, references to
the ―11th Wing, Bolling Air Force Base, District of Colombia‖ have been changed to ―Air Force

                                           Chapter 1

                                   GENERAL GUIDANCE

1.1. Purpose. Nonjudicial punishment (NJP) provides commanders with an essential and
prompt means of maintaining good order and discipline and also promotes positive behavior
changes in service members without the stigma of a court-martial conviction. See MCM, Part V,
paragraphs 1b, 1c and 1e on the nature of NJP. Commanders should consider, where appropriate,
nonpunitive disciplinary measures, such as coun-seling, administrative reprimands and
administrative withholding of privileges before resorting to NJP, but such measures are not
necessary before imposing NJP. MCM, Part V, paragraph 1g.
1.2. Forms. Use the following forms to record NJP actions: AF Form 3070, Record of
Nonjudicial Punishment Proceedings; AF Form 366, Record of Proceedings of Vacation of
Suspended Nonjudicial Punishment; and AF Form 3212, Record of Supplementary Action
under Article 15, UCMJ. Note: Although referenced generally as the AF Form 3070
throughout this publication, the form is further subdivided into three categories to be used
depending on the rank of the member at the time NJP is offered by the commander (3070A for
AB – TSgt, 3070B for MSgt – CMSgt, and 3070C for officers; see Section 6F).
1.3. Supervisory Authority. The officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction
supervises all NJP within the command. See paragraph 6.7.
1.4. Air Force Academy Cadets. For purposes of this instruction, the term "officer" includes
cadets of the US Air Force Academy (USAFA).
1.5. Reporting Senior Officer Cases. Commanders are responsible for reporting NJP actions
on colonel selects and above to SAF/IGS (for general officers) or SAF/IGQ (for colonels and
colonel selects) when initiated and when final action is complete in accordance with AFI 90-301,
Inspector General Complaints. The servicing staff judge advocate will provide commanders a
copy of the completed AF Form 3070, Record of Nonjudicial Punishment Proceedings, with
any attachments and supporting documentation, for forwarding to SAF/IGS or SAF/IGQ.
1.6. Cases Involving State or Foreign Prosecution Interest. If an act or omission is subject to
NJP proceedings and to trial in a state or foreign court, consult AFI 51-201, Administration of
Military Justice. Only the Secretary of the Air Force may approve initiation of NJP action
against a member who has been previously tried by a state or foreign court for the same act or
omission, regardless of the outcome.
1.7. Authority: This AFI is the authority for legal service support listed in this instruction. No
other order, writing, or implementing agreement is required unless otherwise provided for herein.

                                             Chapter 2

               AUTHORITY FOR IMPOSING NONJUDICIAL PUNISHMENT

2.1. Authority of Commanders. Commanders who are commissioned officers may impose
NJP on members of their commands for minor offenses. MCM, Part V, paragraphs 1e and 2a.
2.2. Commanders. "Commander" means a commissioned officer who, by virtue of rank and
assignment, exercises primary command authority over a military organization recognized as a
command. (MCM, Part V, paragraph 2a). An Air Force officer who has assumed or been
appointed to command of an Air Force organization IAW AFI 51-604, Appointment to and
Assumption of Command, is a ―commander‖ under this AFI. For purposes of nonjudicial
punishment, ―commanders‖ are:
     2.2.1. A commander of an Air Force unit, as defined in Attachment 1.
     2.2.2. Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR), which is an officer designated from
     the U.S. Air Force who serves as the commander of all U.S. Air Force forces assigned and
     attached to the U.S. Air Force component in a joint or combined operation. COMAFFORs
     command the U.S. Air Force components of unified commands, specified commands,
     subordinate unified commands, joint task forces, combined commands, and combined task
     forces.
     2.2.3. The commander of an Air Force element, if designated to function as a unit pursuant
     to AFI 38-101, Air Force Organization. This includes the Air Force element of a
     headquarters unit in a joint or combined command or task force as well as the Air Force
     element of an activity outside the Air Force. See definition of ―activity outside the Air Force‖
     in Attachment 1.
     2.2.4. Commanders of detachments, headquarters and squadron sections, and Air Force
     element sections, if properly appointed to command on special orders. See MCM, Part V,
     paragraph 2; AFI 38-101; and AFI 51-604.
     2.2.5. The Senior Air Force Officer (SAFO) in the headquarters staff organization of a
     unified command, subordinate unified command, specified command, joint task force,
     combined command, or combined task force, with respect to Air Force members in the
     headquarters staff organization. Also, the SAFO in the Air Force element of an activity
     outside the Air Force, as defined in Attachment 1, with respect to Air Force members in the
     activity.
        2.2.5.1. The SAFO must be an officer otherwise eligible to command under AFI 51-604.
        2.2.5.2. If the Air Force element of the staff organization is designated to function as a
        unit pursuant to AFI 38-101, the Air Force element commander should exercise NJP
        authority instead of the SAFO. See paragraph 2.2.3. However, the exercise of NJP
        authority by an Air Force element commander does not divest the SAFO of concurrent
        authority to exercise NJP authority under paragraph 2.2.5.
     2.2.6. The commander of Air Force District of Washington (AFDW), Joint Base Andrews
     Naval Air Facility Washington, Maryland, and the commanders of subordinate units when
     designated by the commander of AFDW, for Air Force members assigned to the Air Force
AFI51-202 7 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                    9


   element of an activity outside the Air Force, as defined in Attachment 1. This NJP authority
   is held concurrently with element commanders and SAFOs of activities outside the Air
   Force, as designated in paragraphs 2.2.3 and 2.2.5, respectively.
   2.2.7. The Superintendent of the U.S. Air Force Academy and the commandant of a school
   which is designated as an Air Force unit.
   2.2.8. The commander of a host command, and the commanders of subordinate units when
   designated by the host commander, providing support to a tenant organization pursuant to
   AFI 25-201, Support Agreements Procedures, Chapter 6.
   2.2.9. Joint force commanders of joint activities established under the criteria of Joint
   Publication 0-2, Unified Action Armed Forces, that being unified commands, specified
   commands, subordinate unified commands, and joint task forces.
   2.2.10. Multiservice commanders in combined commands, combined task forces, and
   activities outside the Air Force, as defined in Attachment 1, to whose command members of
   the Air Force are assigned or attached. The multiservice commander must be an officer in the
   U.S. Armed Forces with command authority over the Air Force member.
2.3. Members of their Command. As used in this instruction, "members of their command"
includes the assigned members of the element or organization commanded and members on
temporary duty (TDY) with, or otherwise attached to, the element or organization.
   2.3.1. A member need not be attached on TDY orders for the commander to exercise NJP
   authority if the commander exercises the usual responsibilities of command over the
   member. A TDY commander has concurrent authority with the commander of the member's
   element or organization of permanent assignment.
   2.3.2. A commander will not impose NJP on a member after that member has been
   transferred from the command. If an NJP proceeding has been initiated but punishment was
   not imposed prior to the transfer, the commander who initiated the proceeding may forward
   the record of proceeding to the gaining commander for appropriate disposition. If a member
   transfers after punishment has been imposed but before the action is complete, the action
   (including adjudication of any appeal) will be completed by the imposing commander’s chain
   of command.
2.4. Host Command Jurisdiction. All members of a tenant unit or Air Force element, whether
designated a unit or not, are attached to the host command and its appropriate subordinate and
higher commands for the exercise of nonjudicial punishment authority under Article 15, UCMJ.
However, commanders of tenant units, and other Air Force element officers authorized to impose
nonjudicial punishment pursuant to this instruction, retain concurrent authority to take such
action.
   2.4.1. Any appeal from nonjudicial punishment is made to the superior authority in the
   command channel of the officer who imposes punishment, or to the appeal authority
   otherwise designated by AFLOA/JAJM.
   2.4.2. Regardless of who imposes punishment or acts on the appeal, the action is
   administratively processed through the host command’s Staff Judge Advocate.
   2.4.3. In a Joint Command, if nonjudicial punishment is imposed on an Air Force member
   by a commander of a different service, the decisions as to collateral administrative actions
 10                                                            AFI51-202 7 NOVEMBER 2003


   (e.g. entry into UIF or selection record) will be made by the SAFO or commander of the Air
   Force element in the Joint Command.
       2.4.3.1. If the SAFO or commander of the Air Force element is unavailable or is not
       senior to the commander who imposed nonjudicial punishment, decisions as to collateral
       administrative actions (e.g. entry into UIF or selection record) are made by a general
       court-martial convening authority (GCMCA) of the Air Force Host Command who is
       senior to the commander who imposed nonjudicial punishment. If the Air Force Host
       Command GCMCA is not senior to the commander who imposed punishment, collateral
       administrative action decisions will be made by a GCMCA, who is senior to the
       commander who imposed punishment, designated by the respective Air Force Host
       Command’s MAJCOM commander.
2.5. Nonjudicial Punishment Authority in a Joint Force. A joint force is composed of
significant elements, assigned or attached, of two or more Military Departments operating under
a single commander authorized to exercise operational control over the force to accomplish an
assigned mission. Joint forces are established at unified commands, specified commands,
subordinate unified commands, and joint task forces. Joint forces organizationally consist of a
joint force commander, a joint staff organization, and Service component commands. See Joint
Publication 0-2 and Air Force Doctrine Document 2, Organization and Employment of
Aerospace Power.
   2.5.1. The joint force commander has authority to impose NJP on Air Force members
   assigned or attached to the command, regardless of the commander's parent service, unless
   such authority is withheld by a superior joint commander. Air Force members are "assigned
   or attached to the command" of a joint force commander if they are assigned or attached to
   the joint staff organization, or assigned or attached to a unit which is assigned or attached to
   the joint force.
       2.5.1.1. Coordinates with the SJA assigned to the joint force commander.
       2.5.1.2. Advises on Air Force policy and NJP procedures, including the application of
       Air Force regulations in the administration and processing of NJP actions, and assists the
       joint force SJA in ensuring the NJP action is properly completed by the joint force
       commander.
       2.5.1.3. Enters the NJP proceedings into the Automated Military Justice Analysis and
       Management System (AMJAMS) and ensures appropriate personnel and finance actions
       are taken, including the filing of the action in appropriate personnel records as well as
       Unfavorable Information Files (UIF) and/or selection records. See paragraphs 4.8.1 and
       6.4.2.2 to identify the Air Force officer responsible for deciding selection record and UIF
       actions.
   2.5.2. In accordance with Joint Publication 0-2, joint force commanders will use this
   instruction when imposing NJP on Air Force members; however, joint force commanders
   should normally allow NJP authority over Air Force members to be exercised by the
   appropriate Air Force commander. Matters that involve more than one service or that occur
   outside a military reservation, but within the joint force commander's jurisdiction, may be
   handled either by the joint force commander or, unless withheld by the joint force
   commander, by the appropriate Air Force commander. The appropriate Air Force
AFI51-202 7 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                       11


   commander should normally handle matters that involve only the Air Force, and occur on a
   military reservation or within the military jurisdiction of the Air Force.
   2.5.3. If the joint force commander determines NJP authority over an Air Force member
   should be left to the discretion of Air Force authorities, the appropriate Air Force
   commander, as identified in paragraph 2.2, may take action. Regardless of who imposes
   punishment, the action (i.e. AMJAMS, personnel actions, and finance actions) shall be
   processed through the servicing Air Force SJA for the host command.
2.6. Procedures for Imposing Nonjudicial Punishment in a Joint Force. If the joint force
commander decides to personally initiate NJP proceedings against an Air Force member, the
joint force commander should coordinate with the appropriate Air Force commander before
taking action to ensure procedural awareness and compliance.
   2.6.1. The appropriate Air Force commander immediately notifies the servicing Air Force
   staff judge advocate (SJA). See AFI 25-201, Support Agreements Procedures. The servicing
   Air Force SJA:
       2.6.1.1. Coordinates with the SJA assigned to the joint force commander.
       2.6.1.2. Advises on Air Force policy and NJP procedures, including the application of
       Air Force regulations in the administration and processing of NJP actions, and assists the
       joint force SJA in ensuring the NJP action is properly completed by the joint force
       commander.
       2.6.1.3. Enters the NJP proceedings into the Automated Military Justice Analysis and
       Management System (AMJAMS) and ensures appropriate personnel and finance actions
       are taken, including the filing of the action in appropriate personnel records as well as
       Unfavorable Information Files (UIF) and/or selection records. See paragraphs 4.8.1. and
       6.4.2.2. to identify the Air Force officer responsible for deciding selection record and UIF
       actions.
   2.6.2. If an Air Force judge advocate is assigned to the joint force commander, he or she
   may provide advice to the joint force SJA in lieu of the servicing Air Force SJA for the host
   command. In such cases, however, the servicing Air Force SJA shall be notified of the
   occasion and nature of the advice and action and shall remain responsible for the required
   AMJAMS entries and personnel records and finance actions.
   2.6.3. If the joint force commander determines NJP authority over an Air Force member
   should be left to the discretion of Air Force authorities, the appropriate Air Force
   commander, as identified in paragraph 2.2., may take action. Regardless of who imposes
   punishment, the action (i.e. AMJAMS, personnel actions, and finance actions) shall be
   processed through the servicing Air Force SJA for the host command.
2.7. Procedures for Multiservice Commanders. The multiservice commander, when
imposing NJP on an Air Force member, follows this instruction, including the guidance
applicable to joint force commanders in paragraph 2.4.2. and procedures consistent with those in
paragraph 2.6. Before initiating any NJP action, ensure the multiservice commander has
command authority over the member involved, the appellate authority is identified (see
paragraph 4.2.8.), and administrative processing issues are understood.
 12                                                            AFI51-202 7 NOVEMBER 2003


   2.7.1. The commander’s principle assistant is the officer who would assume command in the
   event of the commander's death, prolonged absence, or disability, or to the vice-commander
   of the organization. See AFI 51-604. However, if that officer is located at another station, the
   commander may delegate authority to the officer on the com-mander's station next eligible to
   assume command.
   2.7.2. SAFOs described in paragraph 2.2.5, who are general officers, may delegate their
   powers under Article 15 to the next senior Air Force officer or another principal assistant
   who is generally equivalent to a vice commander.
2.8. Delegation of Authority. Commanders who are general officers or who exercise general
court-martial convening authority (GCMCA) may delegate their powers under Article 15 to a
principal assistant. The principal assistant then assumes the commander's authority to impose
NJP on members of the command who are subordinate to the principal assistant. Principal
assistants must be military officers to exercise NJP authority, and may impose only the amount
of punishment authorized for their grades (MCM, Part V, paragraph 5b). Delegation of such
authority must be in writing or incorporated in a permanent directive, and should be addressed to
the principal assistant by duty title, rather than by name, except as described in paragraph 2.8.2.
The original written delegation or directive shall be filed in the office of the SJA servicing the
commander concerned. A delegation made by duty title continues in effect when a new principal
assistant occupies the position or when command changes to a new commander, unless or until
expressly rescinded. A commander delegating nonjudicial punishment authority also retains the
authority to administer nonjudicial punishment in the commander's own right.
   2.8.1. The commander's principle assistant is the officer who would assume command in the
   event of the commander's death, prolonged absence, or disability, or to the vice commander
   of the organization. See AFI 51-604. However, if that officer is located at another station, the
   commander may delegate authority to the officer on the commander's station next eligible to
   assume command.
   2.8.2. SAFOs described in paragraph 2.2.5., who are general officers, may delegate their
   powers under Article 15 to the next senior Air Force officer or another principal assistant
   who is generally equivalent to a vice commander.
2.9. Commander as Victim. If a commander is the victim of a crime in his or her personal
capacity (e.g., victim of assault or larceny) as opposed to official capacity (e.g., violation of
commander's order), that commander should forward the report of the incident to the next higher
commander for review and appropriate action.
2.10. Air Force Cadets. Only the Commandant of Cadets, a superior commander at the
USAFA, or a commander designated by the Secretary of the Air Force may impose NJP on
USAFA cadets.
2.11. Air Force Legal Operations Agency. All judge advocates assigned as senior trial and
defense counsel, area defense counsel, and defense paralegals are assigned to Air Force Legal
Operations Agency (AFLOA) for jurisdiction under Article 15, UCMJ. Military judges are
assigned to the Air Force District of Washington (AFDW) for jurisdiction under Article 15,
UCMJ.
2.12. Withholding Authority. A commander at any echelon may withhold from any
subordinate commander all or part of the authority—including the authority to impose NJP for
AFI51-202 7 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                       13


specific types of offenses—that the subordinate would otherwise have under the UCMJ, MCM,
or this instruction. When authority is withheld, such action should be in a clearly defined writing
or permanent directive. File the original of the letter or directive in the office of the SJA
servicing the commander withholding the authority. File a copy in the office of the SJA servicing
the commander whose authority has been withheld. Any such withholding remains in effect
when a new commander assumes either command, until and unless expressly revoked by the
superior commander. Any such action should be addressed by duty title and not by name.
2.13. Exceptions to Support Agreements. When a support agreement differing from the
construct outlined in this instruction is necessary or desirable, it must be documented at the
general court-martial convening authority level or higher.

                                           Chapter 3

  PROCEDURES FOR INITIATING AND IMPOSING NONJUDICIAL PUNISHMENT

Section 3A—Responsibilities of the Initiating Commander

3.1. General Responsibilities. Commanders who initiate NJP action and impose punishment
act on the basis of information they determine relevant. See MCM, Part V, paragraph 4c(3), for
the limited applicability of the Military Rules of Evidence. The commander's action must be
temperate, just, and conducive to good order and discipline. Although it is the SJA’s
responsibility to advise and help the commander to evaluate the facts and determine what offense
was committed, if any, it is the commander who makes the decision to impose punishment and
the degree of punishment.
3.2. Notice of Recoupment of Benefits. Concurrent with initiation of the NJP action, the
initiating commander must provide written notice to a member who has received educational
assistance, special pay, or bonuses concerning the member's obligation to reimburse the Air
Force if the member is discharged (or involuntarily separated) for misconduct. This notice shall
be accomplished in item 3 of the AF Form 3070. The member's signature in item 3 constitutes
acknowledgement of this notice. The statement of understanding regarding recoupment is
inserted in item 14 as a continuation of item 3. (See Attachment 2 for a sample statement).
Noncompliance with this provision shall not affect the legal sufficiency of the NJP action.
3.3. Timeliness of Actions. In order to maximize disciplinary and rehabilitative effect, NJP
should be offered as soon as possible after facts become known by the member’s commander
which indicate that offenses may have been committed. Commanders should offer NJP within 10
days of the date of discovery of the offense. However, failure to meet this processing goal shall
not preclude a commander from initiating NJP proceedings. NJP actions should be complete
(Servicing SJA Review) within 20 days of the offer date. The impartial and timely
administration of military justice helps sustain good order and discipline. SJAs and chiefs of
military justice should regularly analyze the Automated Military Justice Analysis and
Management (AMJAMS) data as to each segment of NJP processing they control to determine
specific areas for improvement, and implement appropriate management measures to maximize
effectiveness and efficiency. The following metrics have been established to assist in expediting
the administration of justice:
   3.3.1. Complete 80% of all NJP actions (Date of Discovery of the Offense through Servicing
   SJA Review Date) within 30 days.
   3.3.2. The date of discovery of the offense is defined as the date when an investigative
   agency (e.g. OSI, SFOI, IG), legal office, commander, supervisor, or first sergeant becomes
   aware of an allegation and a subject has been identified, including when notification is made
   by civilian authorities. In a case involving a Commander Directed Investigation (CDI), the
   date of discovery of an offense is when a commander is notified of an allegation that an
   offense has been committed and a subject has been identified. If an allegation is investigated
   by CDI and is subsequently turned over to an investigative agency for further investigation,
   use the date the commander first became aware of the allegation and a subject has been
   identified. In all cases, where additional allegations against an identified subject are
   discovered, use the earliest date of discovery of all offenses.
AFI51-202 7 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                     15


3.4. Standard of Proof. While no specific standard of proof applies to NJP proceedings,
including appeals, commanders should recognize that a member is entitled to demand trial by
court-martial, in which case proof beyond a reasonable doubt of each element of every offense
by legal and competent evidence is a prerequisite to conviction. Whether such proof is available
should be considered before initiating action under Article 15. If such proof is lacking, NJP
action is usually not warranted.
3.5. Providing Evidence to the Member. After a commander serves the AF Form 3070 on a
member, that member and his counsel have a right to examine all statements and other evidence
upon which the commander has examined and intends to rely in arriving at a decision to impose
punishment, and as to the quantum of punishment to be imposed. Members are normally
provided a copy of the documentary evidence unless the matters are privileged, classified, or
otherwise restricted by law, regulation, or instruction.

Section 3B—Initiating Nonjudicial Punishment

3.6. Initial Considerations. After making a preliminary inquiry, the commander consults with
the servicing SJA to determine whether NJP is appropriate under the circumstances and, if so,
whether the commander can initiate proceedings personally, or should or must refer the matter to
a superior commander for action. Such referral is appropriate when the commander cannot
impose an appropriate punishment because of the member's grade, or where authority has been
withheld. See Table 3.1 and Table 3.2, and paragraph 2.10.
   3.6.1. When initiation of NJP action is under consideration, the member’s personal data is
   normally available to the legal office through the Automated Military Justice Analysis and
   Management System (AMJAMS). The member’s personal data is also available by
   requesting an AMJAMS Report on Individual Personnel (RIP) from the member’s orderly
   room or servicing Military Personnel Flight (MPF). However, don’t delay initiation for
   receipt of an AMJAMS RIP.
3.7. Members Attached to the Command. In some cases, commanders initiate NJP
proceedings against members who are in their commands by virtue of being TDY or otherwise
attached to the commander's organization. In these cases, the commander should confer
whenever possible with the member's parent organization commander about whether NJP should
be offered by the TDY commander or the parent organization commander. If the TDY
commander intends to initiate NJP, he or she should confer with the parent organization
commander concerning the member's background, past duty performance, and other relevant
factors before initiating the action. If the member is in the Air Force Reserve or Air National
Guard, prior coordination with his parent organization commander is required.
3.8. Description of Offense. The SJA should advise the commander how to properly allege
each offense to state a violation of the UCMJ, consistent with available facts and evidence.
Follow the form of specifications in MCM, Part IV. However, an NJP action remains valid even
if the specification fails to include all the elements of an offense, provided that the member is
reasonably informed of the nature of the alleged misconduct. The legal office shall provide the
language describing each offense on the AF Form 3070, except where impractical. Computerized
forms authorized by AFLOA/JAJM should be used where available.
3.9. Notifying the Member.
 16                                                           AFI51-202 7 NOVEMBER 2003


   3.9.1. A commander initiating an NJP proceeding completes item 1 of the AF Form 3070,
   signs and dates the form, and causes the member to be notified and advised of his or her
   rights using AF Form 3070. MCM, Part V, paragraph 4a. Normally, the initiating commander
   notifies and serves the member, then signs and annotates the date and time the member was
   served notice of the proceeding in item 2 of the AF Form 3070. Where circumstances prevent
   the initiating commander from personally notifying and serving the AF Form 3070 on the
   member or the initiating commander elects not to do so, the initiating commander may direct
   a subordinate, senior in rank to the member (when practicable), to notify and serve the
   member. The subordinate annotates the date and time of service and signs in item 2 of the AF
   Form 3070 as the person serving the member. Regardless of who serves the member, provide
   the member with a copy of all three pages of the AF Form 3070 and any attachments. Also
   make available to the member all statements and evidence upon which the commander
   intends to rely in making his or her decision.
   3.9.2. If a commander refers the matter to a superior commander, the superior commander
   should normally initiate the NJP action and provide the notification. Where it is not practical
   for the member to appear personally before the superior commander, the subordinate
   commander may initiate the NJP proceeding using the AF Form 3070, item 1.a.(2). When
   doing so, the subordinate commander notifies the member that NJP proceedings before a
   superior commander is being recommended (including the identity of the superior
   commander) and advises the member of his or her rights.
   3.9.3. A commander who initially recommended NJP proceedings by a superior commander
   may dispose of the case personally if the AF Form 3070 has not been forwarded to the
   superior commander. If the commander does not intend to personally pursue the matter as an
   NJP action, the commander withdraws the AF Form 3070 and provides it to the servicing
   SJA so termination of NJP proceedings can be recorded in AMJAMS. If the commander
   intends to personally pursue the matter as an NJP action, the commander has two options.
   First, the commander may notify the member by memorandum that he or she intends to
   decide whether to impose punishment under the pending NJP action instead of the superior
   commander, giving the member a new opportunity (3 duty days) to accept NJP proceedings
   or demand trial by court-martial. Attach the memorandum to the AF Form 3070.
   Alternatively, the commander may withdraw the existing action and initiate a new action on
   a new AF Form 3070.
3.10. Changing Commanders before Nonjudicial Punishment Proceedings are
Complete. A member must always be informed of the identity of the commander who will
actually make the findings and punishment decisions before a decision is required as to whether
to accept nonjudicial punishment or demand court-martial.
   3.10.1. If a new commander assumes responsibility for the case after the member was
   offered NJP proceedings, but before findings are made and punishment, if any, has been
   imposed, inform the member of the identity of the new commander and provide 3 duty days
   to accept NJP proceedings or to demand trial by court-martial. The new commander
   accomplishes this by either notifying the member about the change in writing, using the
   notification format in Attachment 4, or by withdrawing the old AF Form 3070 and initiating
   a new action on a new AF Form 3070. If the notification format is used, it becomes an
   attachment to the AF Form 3070.
AFI51-202 7 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                     17


   3.10.2. If a change in commanders occurs after imposition of punishment but before the
   appeal decision has been made, inform the member in writing of the identity of the new
   commander and obtain an acknowledgment of this change from the member. Attach the
   notification and acknowledgment to the original AF Form 3070. Such a change neither
   impacts the former commander’s action nor affords the member additional rights. The new
   commander has full authority to ensure completion of the action. However, if an appeal is
   made, the former commander must prepare a written summary of any oral presentation and
   the source and substance of any other information considered, consistent with paragraph
   4.6.3. Notification of a change in commanders merely for the Unfavorable Information File
   (UIF) decision (paragraph 6.4.2) is not required.
   3.10.3. If a commander notifies a member of the intent to recommend that a superior
   commander impose NJP, a change of the superior commander provides the identical rights,
   creating a new opportunity to accept or reject NJP. The subordinate commander follows the
   procedures set forth above in such situations.
3.11. Discovery of Additional Offenses. When evidence of an additional offense or offenses
arises following initiation of NJP proceedings, but before the member is notified of the
punishment, a commander may:
   3.11.1. Withdraw the initial AF Form 3070 and reinitiate NJP to include all offenses. If the
   form has been sent to a superior commander, do so only with the superior's agreement; or
   3.11.2. Proceed with the initial NJP proceeding and offer a second NJP for the additional
   offense or offenses.
3.12. Member’s Decision to Accept or Reject Nonjudicial Punishment. Acceptance of NJP
is a choice of forum, not an admission of guilt. The member has 3 duty days to accept or reject
NJP following notification of the intent to impose NJP. Weekends and holidays are counted if
they are normally scheduled duty days for the member. In practical application, the member is
not required to accept or reject NJP sooner than 72 hours following notification of the intent to
impose NJP. The initiating commander may, upon written application, grant an extension for
good cause.
   3.12.1. Members must reflect their NJP decision by initialing the appropriate blocks in item
   3 of the AF Form 3070, sign and then annotate the date and time signed. Member must initial
   whether or not the member:
       3.12.1.1. Consulted a lawyer.
       3.12.1.2. Demands trial by court-martial or waives the right to court-martial and accepts
       NJP proceedings.
       3.12.1.3. Attached a written presentation.
       3.12.1.4. Requests a personal appearance before the commander and whether or not the
       member requests the personal appearance be public.
   3.12.2. The member has a right to consult a lawyer before making any decisions, and a
   lawyer may assist the member throughout the proceedings. The location and phone number
   of the closest military defense counsel should be provided to the member to further explain
   the member's rights. The member may retain civilian counsel at the member's own expense.
   The commander should encourage the member to take full advantage of this time to consult
 18                                                            AFI51-202 7 NOVEMBER 2003


   with legal counsel, to decide whether to accept NJP proceedings, and if so, to prepare matters
   in defense, extenuation, or mitigation. The right to legal counsel does not include the right to
   request individual military defense counsel as defined in MCM, Part II; Rules for Courts-
   Martial (RCM), Rule 506(b)(1); and AFI 51-201. However, where a member asserts an
   attorney-client relationship with a military defense counsel other than the detailed military
   defense counsel, in regard to the same matter for which he or she is being offered nonjudicial
   punishment, process the request for this counsel according to the provisions of AFI 51-201.
   3.12.3. If a member does not reply with his or her elections in time, the commander may
   continue with the proceedings and note in item 3 of AF Form 3070 "member failed to
   respond" and initial. The member's failure to respond in time is deemed an acceptance of
   nonjudicial proceedings under Article 15. However, if the commander has reason to believe a
   failure to respond resulted from reasons beyond that individual's control; the commander
   may not, without good cause, proceed with NJP action.
3.13. Member's Presentation. See MCM, Part V, paragraph 4c. A member is generally
entitled to appear personally before the imposing commander and present matters in defense,
mitigation, or extenuation, except under extraordinary circumstances or when the imposing
commander is unavailable. There is no requirement that a lawyer be made available to
accompany the member at a personal appearance. See MCM, Part V, paragraph 4c(1) for the
member's entitlements at a personal appearance.
      3.13.1. If a personal appearance before a superior commander in proceedings initiated
      under paragraph 3.9.2 is prevented by the unavailability of the superior commander or by
      extraordinary circumstances, the member may appear personally before the subordinate
      commander who served him or her with the AF Form 3070. The subordinate commander
      then prepares a memorandum summarizing the presentation and forwards it to the
      superior commander, along with all written matters submitted by the member.
      3.13.2. Under any other circumstances where a personal appearance is prevented by the
      unavailability of the imposing commander or by other extraordinary circumstances, the
      member appears personally before a person designated by the imposing commander. The
      designee prepares a memorandum summarizing the presentation and forwards it to the
      imposing commander, along with all written matters submitted by the member. MCM,
      Part V, paragraph 4c(1).
       3.13.3. The commander may open the personal appearance to the public, even though the
       member does not request it or agree the appearance should be open, subject to the
       following restrictions. Public NJP at commander's calls, unit training assemblies and
       other public gatherings is inappropriate without the consent of the member. NJP
       proceedings may be attended by a limited number of people in a more private setting, i.e.,
       the commander's office. The individuals in attendance at NJP proceedings should
       normally be limited to those in the member’s supervisory chain or people who can assist
       the decision authority (First Sergeant, Squadron Section Commander, etc.). Public NJP
      during the offer portion of the process at commander’s calls, unit training assemblies and
      other public gatherings is permissible with the consent of the member. The member must
      be given an opportunity to consult with counsel before deciding whether or not to consent
      to any such public proceedings.
AFI51-202 7 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                     19


       3.13.4. If the proceedings involve a waiver of the statute of limitations, the member must
       sign a written waiver that becomes an attachment to the AF Form 3070. See MCM, Part
       V, paragraph 1f(4); RCM 907(b)(2)(B); and United States v. Moore, 32 M.J. 170 (CMA
       1991).

Section 3C—Imposing and Administering Punishments

3.14. Commander's Findings.
   3.14.1. Following full and fair consideration of the evidence, including any matters
   presented by the member, the commander indicates one of the following actions in item 4.a.
   of the AF Form 3070 by marking or initialing the appropriate block on the form:
       3.14.1.1. The proceedings are terminated because NJP is not appropriate or because the
       member did not commit the offense(s) alleged.
       3.14.1.2. The member committed one or more offenses alleged. The commander lines
       out and initials any offense(s) for which NJP is not appropriate or which the member did
       not commit. If the member committed one or more lesser included offenses, the
       commander consults with the SJA before changing an alleged offense to a lesser included
       offense.
   3.14.2. If the commander terminates the proceedings, the original AF Form 3070 is sent to
   the servicing SJA for appropriate AMJAMS entries. The AF Form 3070 is then destroyed.
3.15. Commander’s Punishments. The commander must consult the servicing SJA before
imposing punishment except where impracticable due to military exigencies. The commander
completes item 4, and signs and dates the form in the indicated blocks. Punishment is recorded in
item 14 of the AF Form 3070 as a continuation of 4.a.(2). See Attachment 5 for examples of
punishment formats. The date of imposition of NJP is the date the form is signed by the
commander in the signature block in item 4. The member should be informed of the punishment
and acknowledge receipt of the action on the same date punishment is imposed. See paragraph
4.5.2. The commander may suspend all or a portion of the punishment when imposed. If the
commander is not able to inform the member of the punishment on the date imposed, the
member should be informed as quickly as possible. For additional guidance on suspension of
punishment, see paragraph 5.4.
3.16. Maximizing the Impact of Punishment. Whenever possible, the commander should
impose nonjudicial punishment personally.
3.17. Permissible Punishments. Table 3.1 and Table 3.2 set out the maximum permissible
punishments, based on the grade and status of the commander and the grade of the member. If
after considering matters presented by the member the commander determines the member
committed one or more to the alleged offenses, and NJP is appropriate, the commander must
select at least one of the permissible punishments set out in Table 3.1 or Table 3.2. However, if
the commander determines the member should not receive any form of authorized punishment,
then the commander must find that NJP is not appropriate and terminate the proceedings.
   3.17.1. The maximum authorized punishment in a single case is subject to the limitations in
   MCM, Part V, paragraph 5d.
 20                                                            AFI51-202 7 NOVEMBER 2003


   3.17.2. Commanders should generally impose an unsuspended reduction in grade in
   combination with forfeitures of pay only when the maximum exercise of NJP authority is
   warranted (e.g., repeat offender, most serious offenses, past rehabilitative efforts have failed,
   or recalcitrant offender). This general policy does not preclude such punishment where
   warranted in the sound exercise of judgment by the commander imposing punishment.
   3.17.3. No more than one-half of the member’s pay per month is subject to forfeiture,
   regardless of the number of Article 15s imposed.
   3.17.4. Subject to the restrictions outlined in this paragraph, extra duties imposed as part of
   NJP may be required to be performed at any time and for any length of time during the
   period of punishment. No extra duties may be imposed which constitute: cruel or unusual
   punishment; punishment not sanctioned by the customs of the Air Force (e.g., using the
   member as a personal servant); duties normally intended as an honor (e.g., assignment to
   honor guard); actions required to be performed in an unnecessarily degrading manner (e.g.,
   an order to clean a floor with a toothbrush); duties that are a safety or health hazard to the
   member; or duties that would demean the member’s position as an NCO.
3.18. Punishment Effective Date. Unsuspended reductions in grade and forfeitures of pay take
effect on the date the commander imposes punishment. MCM, Part V, paragraph 5g. All other
unsuspended punishments take effect immediately upon notification to the member, unless the
commander provides otherwise in the punishment endorsement. The suspension of a punishment
takes effect on the date the commander imposes punishment, not the date the member was
notified of the punishment.
   3.18.1. Prompt execution of punishment is desired absent unique circumstances, which
   include, but are not limited to, the member serving similar punishment from a prior UCMJ
   action, lack of available space in a correctional custody facility, physical incapacity of the
   airman, emergency leave, and/or humanitarian considerations.
   3.18.2. Once commenced, punishments involving restraint (i.e., correctional custody,
   restrictions, or arrest in quarters) or extra duties run continuously. However, these
   punishments may be stayed pursuant to the member's request based upon an appeal not being
   acted upon in accordance with MCM, Part V, paragraph 7d, or when temporarily interrupted
   due to either the fault of the member or unique circumstance as listed above in paragraph
   3.18.1. Note that special rules for imposing punishment on reserve component members may
   be authorized under MCM, Part V, paragraphs 5e and 5f.
3.19. Release of Information. Public release of information subsequent to imposition of
punishment should be limited to an individual’s rank, offense, punishment and squadron. Do not
release information that would readily identify the member.

Section 3D—Action When the Member Demands Trial by Court-Martial

3.20. Restrictions. If a member demands trial by court-martial, the commander may not impose
NJP.
3.21. Commander's Options. The commander is not required to prefer court-martial charges,
and no mandate exists to refer a case to trial by court-martial. Charges preferred following
rejection of an offered Article 15 are in no way limited to those originally included in the offer.
AFI51-202 7 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                   21


The form and substance of the charges may be altered to meet legal or proof requirements, and
new charges may be added.
3.22. Withdrawing Demand for Trial. Once a member demands trial, the member may
withdraw it only with the commander's approval. In addition, convening authority concurrence is
required if charges have been preferred. Procedurally, the member must submit a written request
to the commander who will then indorse approval or disapproval. The request will become an
attachment to the AF Form 3070. If withdrawal is granted, pen and ink changes should be made
in item 3 of the AF Form 3070 to reflect the member's new decision to accept NJP proceedings
and the commander should continue with the NJP proceedings. While this is the preferred
resolution, initiating a new NJP proceeding remains an alternative.

NOTE:
   1. See MCM, Part V, paragraph 5d, for further limitations on combinations of punish-ments.
   For example, restriction and extra duties can be combined to run concurrently, but the
   combination must not be for a period in excess of the maximum duration imposable for extra
   duties. This means a field grade officer may combine 45 days of extra duties to run
   concurrently with 45 days of restriction when imposing NJP on an enlisted member.
 22                                                          AFI51-202 7 NOVEMBER 2003


   2. CMSgt or SMSgt may be reduced one grade only by MAJCOM commanders,
   commanders of unified or specified commands, or commanders to whom promotion
   authority to these grades has been delegated. See AFI 36-2502, Airmen Promotion Program.
   3. Neither bread and water nor diminished rations punishments are authorized.
   4. Frocked commanders may exercise only that authority associated with their actual pay
   grade. No increased punishment authority is conferred by assumption of the title and insignia
   of the frocked grade.

NOTE:
   1. Officers in the grade of Lieutenant Colonel and below (includes frocked Colonels) may
   not impose NJP on an officer.
   2. Only MAJCOM commanders, commanders of unified commands, and their equivalents,
   or higher may impose NJP on general officers.
   3. See MCM, Part V, paragraph 5d, for further limitations on combinations of punishments.
AFI51-202 7 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                    23


                                          Chapter 4

                         NONJUDICIAL PUNISHMENT APPEALS

4.1. General Guidance. An appeal may be taken if a member considers the punishment to be
unjust or disproportionate to the offense. MCM, Part V, paragraph 7a. The findings, the
punishment, or both may be appealed. A member may assert the punishment is unjust because
the offense was not committed.
4.2. Appellate Authority. NJP appeals are made to the ―next superior authority,‖ who is
generally the immediate Air Force commander superior to the officer who imposed the
punishment. For purposes of determining the ―next superior authority,‖ a principal assistant who
imposed punishment is considered the functional equivalent of the officer who delegated the
power. Some situations call for application of the following special rules:
   4.2.1. When a principal assistant to a commander of an Air Force establishment, unit, or
   non-unit (other than Air Force elements of organizations outside the Air Force) imposed
   punishment, the ―next superior authority‖ is the next Air Force commander superior to the
   commander who delegated the power.
   4.2.2. When a detachment commander imposes punishment, the ―next superior authority‖ is
   the detachment commander’s immediate commander and not the commander of the host
   installation.
   4.2.3. When a section commander of a squadron imposes punishment, the "next superior
   authority" is the squadron commander's superior commander. However, when a section
   commander for all other units or elements imposes punishment (i.e., Group, Wing,
   Numbered Air Force, Major Command, Center, Field Operating Agency, and Direct
   Reporting Unit), the "next superior authority" is the section commander's immediate
   commander.
   4.2.4. When an Air Force element commander, as identified in paragraph 2.2.5.2, imposes
   punishment, the "next superior authority" is the SAFO for elements under the SAFO's direct
   authority.
       4.2.4.1. A SAFO may not act as the "next superior authority" if the SAFO is not at least
       a field grade officer, and higher in grade to the element commander who imposed the
       punishment. Paragraph 4.2.5 or 4.2.6 should be applied in these cases.
       4.2.4.2. A SAFO may not act as the "next superior authority" if the SAFO is also acting
       as the element commander. Paragraph 4.2.5 or 4.2.6 should be applied in these cases.
   4.2.5. When either a SAFO or Air Force element commander (whose SAFO is unable to act
   under paragraph 4.2.4.1 and 4.2.4.2) for the headquarters staff organization in a unified
   command, specified command, subordinate unified command, joint task force, combined
   command or combined task force imposes punishment, the "next superior authority" is the
   SAFO or Air Force element commander in the headquarters staff organization at the next
   superior level in the joint or combined force, if any, or the general court-martial convening
   authority (GCMCA) for the Air Force unit responsible for providing support to the
   headquarters staff organization under AFI 25-201. The Air Force officer who acts on the
   appeal must at least be a field grade officer and higher in grade to the officer who imposed
 24                                                           AFI51-202 7 NOVEMBER 2003


   the punishment. When the next superior authority is not at least a field grade officer and
   higher in grade to the SAFO or Air Force element commander who imposed the punishment,
   or when the SAFO or Air Force element commander for the headquarters staff of a unified
   command imposed the punishment, the AF/CV is the "next superior authority" and the appeal
   is forwarded directly to AFLOA/JAJM.
   4.2.6. When the SAFO or Air Force element commander (whose SAFO is unable to act
   under paragraph 4.2.4.1 and 4.2.4.2) of an activity outside the Air Force imposes punishment,
   the "next superior authority" is the Commander, AFDW. However, if the Commander,
   AFDW, is not higher in grade to the SAFO or element commander who imposed punishment,
   the AF/CV is the "next superior authority" and the appeal is forwarded directly to
   AFLOA/JAJM.
   4.2.7. When the commander of a MAJCOM, direct reporting unit, or field operating agency
   imposes punishment, SECAF has designated AF/CC as the appellate authority and authorized
   AF/CC to delegate this authority to AF/CV. Forward such appeals directly to AFLOA/JAJM.
   4.2.8. When a joint force commander, including an Air Force officer acting in his or her
   capacity as a joint force commander, imposes punishment, the ―next superior authority‖ is
   the next superior joint force commander. When the commander of a unified command
   imposes punishment, or is otherwise disqualified from being the appellate authority, forward
   the appeal to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for appropriate action by the Secretary
   of Defense or his designee, in accordance with Joint Publication 0-2. The SAFO or
   commander of the member’s element notifies the servicing Air Force SJA of the appeal. The
   servicing SJA coordinates with the SJA or legal counsel who services the appellate authority
   to explain Air Force policy and procedures for NJP, and to advise the appellate authority’s
   SJA or legal counsel that collateral decisions and processing (such as AMJAMS inputs,
   personnel and finance actions, and UIF and selection record entries) will be made within Air
   Force channels.
   4.2.9. When a multiservice commander in a combined command, combined task force, or
   activity outside the Air Force imposes NJP on an Air Force member, the next superior
   authority is the immediate multiservice commander who is a member of the U.S. Armed
   Forces and who is superior to the imposing commander, if any, or the Air Force GCMCA
   with UCMJ authority over the Air Force member. However, if the next superior authority or
   GCMCA is junior in grade to the imposing commander, the AF/CV is the "next superior
   authority" and the appeal is forwarded directly to AFLOA/JAJM.
   4.2.10. When a unique command structure or situation exists, AFLOA/JAJM may designate
   another individual to act as the appellate authority. Applications for such designations shall
   be submitted to AFLOA/JAJM in writing through appropriate command channels.
4.3. Format. Appeals must be in writing. No right or entitlement to a personal appearance
before the appellate authority is provided. See MCM, Part V, paragraph 7c.
4.4. Delegation of Authority. If the "next superior authority" is a general officer or a GCMCA,
that individual may delegate the power to act on appeals to a principal assistant in the manner
described in paragraph 2.7.
4.5. Procedures for Appeals.
AFI51-202 7 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                        25


   4.5.1. Punishment is not stayed pending appeal, except as provided in MCM, Part V,
   paragraph 7d.
   4.5.2. At the time a commander informs the member of the punishment, the commander:
      4.5.2.1. Directs the member to acknowledge receipt of the punishment and right to
      appeal by signing item 5 of the AF Form 3070, and then annotating the date and time
      signed.
          4.5.2.1.1. If the member refuses to acknowledge receipt of the punishment and rights
          to appeal, the commander will note in item 5 "member refused to acknowledge
          receipt of punishment and right to appeal" and initial. The time limit for appeal is still
          applicable despite the member's failure to sign the AF Form 3070.
      4.5.2.2. Informs the member that the appeal can be filed anytime within 5 calendar days.
      A decision not to appeal is final.
      4.5.2.3. Explains that if an appeal is not filed within 5 days, appellate rights will be
      waived. The commander may grant an extension of time to appeal for good cause and
      upon written application received within the 5-day appeal period.
      4.5.2.4. Explains to the member that any documents supporting the appeal must be
      submitted at the same time the member makes the appeal decision.
      4.5.2.5. Explains to the member that he or she is entitled to the advice of legal counsel in
      making the appeal decision.
   4.5.3. The member must reflect his or her appeal decision by initialing only one block in
   item 6a-c of the AF Form 3070, sign the form, and then annotate the date and time signed.
   Note: Senior NCOs and officers must also initial the appropriate block in item 6d-e for
   matters pertaining to their selection record. See paragraph 4.8.
      4.5.3.1. The member makes a choice between not appealing, appealing and submitting
      matters in writing, or appealing and not submitting matters in writing.
      4.5.3.2. The appeal decision is a one-time decision made during the time limit for appeal
      explained in paragraph 4.5.2.2. All documents supporting the appeal must be submitted at
      the same time as the appeal decision. If the member decides not to appeal, the imposing
      commander makes the UIF determination in item 9 of the AF Form 3070 and continues
      processing the NJP action in accordance with Section 6B. If the member decides to
      appeal, the imposing commander continues processing the appeal.
      4.5.3.3. The member's decision to appeal or not to appeal in item 6 of the AF Form 3070
      ends the time limit for appeal. If the imposing commander has not acted on the appeal,
      the member may withdraw the appeal. Pen and ink changes should be made in item 6 of
      the AF Form 3070 to reflect the member's decision not to appeal.
      4.5.3.4. If the member refuses to sign his or her appeal decision within the time limit for
      appeal, the commander will note in item 6 of the AF Form 3070 "member refused to
      make appeal decision within the time limit for appeal" and initial. The member's failure
      to respond in time is deemed a waiver of his or her right to appeal.
4.6. Action on Appeal by Imposing Commander.
 26                                                            AFI51-202 7 NOVEMBER 2003


   4.6.1. The imposing commander examines the written matters submitted, if any, and after
   consulting with the SJA, may grant the relief requested in whole or in part, by using his or
   her powers to suspend, mitigate, remit, or set aside the punishment.
   4.6.2. The imposing commander records his or her decision on the appeal in item 7 of the
   AF Form 3070 by initialing the appropriate block and signing the form. If the imposing
   commander grants relief, he or she annotates the relief granted in item 14 as a continuation of
   item 7. The annotation should state "As the commander who imposed nonjudicial
   punishment, I grant your appeal [(in full)(in part)] as follows: (State the specific relief
   granted)." If the commander grants full relief, do not forward the appeal. If the commander
   grants less than the full relief requested, forward the appeal to the appellate authority.
   4.6.3. If the appeal is forwarded to the appellate authority, the imposing commander adds
   written comments by indorsement through the servicing SJA (see MCM, Part V, paragraph
   7e) addressing any contentions raised by the member. The imposing commander states in the
   forwarding indorsement whether the member has served any portion of the punishment. The
   imposing commander includes in the package all written materials considered in imposing
   the punishment, including a summary of the member's oral presentation, if applicable, as well
   as a summary of any other information considered and its source. The indorsement may state
   the commander’s rationale for imposing punishment and a recommendation for action on the
   appeal. Since the indorsement includes deliberative process, the member is not entitled to a
   copy.
4.7. Action on Appeal by Appellate Authority. The appellate authority reviews the written
material forwarded by the initiating commander and the legal review required by MCM, Part V,
Section 7e. The legal review must be in writing. This material does not become part of the
permanent record, but is returned to the SJA for filing. The appellate authority may grant the
relief requested in whole or in part, by using the same power as may be exercised by the
imposing commander to suspend, mitigate, remit, or set aside the punishment. The appellate
authority records his or her decision on the appeal in item 8 of the AF Form 3070 by initialing
the appropriate block and signing the form. Relief granted (in full or in part) is recorded in item
14 as a continuation of item 8. Unless otherwise stated, relief granted as a result of an appeal is
effective from the date the punishment was initially imposed. See MCM, Part V, paragraph 7f(1).
If all punishment is disapproved, the entire action must be set aside and removed from the
member's record; an NJP action cannot consist of "no punishment."
4.8. Officer and Senior Noncommissioned Officer (NCO) Selection Record
Determination. When the member is an officer or a senior NCO (Master Sergeant and above),
the imposing commander must decide whether to file the record of NJP in the member's selection
record. This decision is made after punishment is imposed and any appeal is resolved. Follow the
procedures in AFI 36-2608, Military Personnel Records Systems. Also refer to AFI 36-2608 for
filing records of vacation or supplemental proceedings (i.e., AF Forms 366 and 3212). The GCM
SJA shall simultaneously forward the final decision memorandum regarding the selection record
and any related correspondence (the commander's intent to file memorandum and individual
statements, if any) with the original record of NJP for inclusion in the member's master
personnel record group in accordance with paragraph 6.8.
AFI51-202 7 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                27


  4.8.1. In a joint or combined command or task force, if an officer assigned to a different
  service imposed NJP on an Air Force member, the Air Force officer identified in AFI 36-
  2608 must make the selection record filing decision.
 28                                                             AFI51-202 7 NOVEMBER 2003


                                            Chapter 5

                                SUPPLEMENTARY ACTIONS

Section 5A—Suspension, Mitigation, Remission and Set Aside of Punishment

5.1. General Guidance. Use AF Form 3212, Record of Supplementary Action Under
Article 15, UCMJ, to record actions to suspend, mitigate, remit, or set aside punishment, unless
such actions are accomplished as part of an appeal, which is governed by Chapter 4.
5.2. Consultation Required. Commanders must consult the servicing SJA before taking action
to suspend, mitigate, remit, or set aside a previously imposed punishment. A commander may
take such action upon his or her own initiative or upon a request from the member. Members
requesting such relief should use the sample format at Attachment 5.
5.3. Action by Successor in Command. A commander's power to suspend, mitigate, remit, or
set aside NJP passes to any successor in command. For these purposes, the successor in
command may be either:
   5.3.1. The officer who succeeded to the command or the position of the officer who imposed
   the punishment and who is authorized to impose on the member the punishment involved; or
   5.3.2. An officer authorized to impose on the member the punishment involved, if the
   member has been reassigned. If the successor lacks authority, that officer forwards the
   member's request to the next superior commander. MCM, Part V, paragraph 7f(1).
5.4. Suspension. See MCM, Part V, paragraph 6a. Suspension is the postponement of the
application of all or part of the punishment for a specific probationary period, until a specified
date. It will be automatically remitted (canceled) at the end of that period, if the member does not
violate the condition(s) of suspension. Suspension is often warranted for a first offense, or where
persuasive extenuating or mitigating circumstances exist.
   5.4.1. A commander may, at any time, suspend any part or amount of the unexecuted
   punishment imposed. An executed punishment of reduction in grade or forfeiture may be
   suspended, provided the suspension is accomplished within a period of 4 months after the
   date imposed.
   5.4.2. Suspension of punishment may not be for a period longer than 6 months from the date
   the suspension was imposed, and the expiration of the current enlistment or term of service of
   the member involved automatically terminates any period of suspension. However, six
   months may be longer than 180 days; for example, 1 July punishment suspended through 31
   December. A suspension action will set a specific date after which, unless sooner vacated,
   the suspension will terminate and the punishment will be remitted. This date should not
   exceed the member’s expiration of term of service (ETS) at the time suspension action is
   taken.
   5.4.3. When reduction in grade is later suspended, the member's original date of rank
   (DOR), held before the reduction, is reinstated. The effective DOR, however, is the date of
   the document directing the suspension. See AFI 36-2604, Service Dates and Dates of Rank.
AFI51-202 7 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                          29


   5.4.4. Suspension of a punishment automatically includes a condition that the service
   member does not violate any punitive articles of the UCMJ. Commanders may specify other
   conditions as well, but shall consult with the SJA before imposing them. Include any
   additional conditions of suspension within the punishment indorsement. The additional
   condition(s) upon which suspension is based must be clearly stated and capable of being
   completed during the period of suspension. See Attachment 5 for sample language.
   5.4.5. The member, if undergoing a suspended reduction in grade, is ineligible for
   promotion, including testing and consideration if already tested. See AFI 36-2502, Airman
   Promotion Program. The member, if serving any suspended punishment, is ineligible to
   reenlist, but may be eligible for an extension of enlistment. See AFI 36-2606, Reenlistment
   in the United States Air Force.
5.5. Mitigation. See MCM, Part V, paragraph 6b. Mitigation is a reduction in either the
quantity or quality of a punishment with its general nature remaining the same. (For example, a
punishment of correctional custody for 20 days can be mitigated to correctional custody for 10
days or to restriction for 20 days. The first action lessens the quantity and the second lessens the
quality, with both mitigated punishments remaining of the same general nature as correctional
custody; that is, deprivation of liberty. However, a mitigation of 10 days correctional custody to
14 days restriction would not be permitted because the quantity has been increased.)
   5.5.1. With the exception of reduction in grade, only the unexecuted part or amount of the
   punishment can be mitigated.
   5.5.2. A reduction in grade, whether executed or unexecuted, can only be mitigated to
   forfeitures. A reduction in grade will not be mitigated to a lesser reduction or no reduction.
   Mitigation of a reduction in grade must be done within 4 months after the date of execution.
   When mitigating a reduction in grade to forfeiture of pay, the amount of the forfeiture
   imposed may not be greater than the amount that could have been imposed by the officer
   who initially imposed the mitigated punishment. See MCM, Part V, paragraph 6b. If the
   reduction was executed, the DOR for the restored grade is the date of the indorsement
   mitigating the punishment. For example, if an member receives Article 15 punishment on 1
   June, consisting of a reduction in grade, and the commander subsequently (on 1 July)
   mitigates the reduction to a forfeiture, both the effective date and DOR for the restored grade
   is 1 July. See AFI 36-2604, Service Dates and Dates of Rank.
   5.5.3. A forfeiture of pay, to the extent to which it has not been executed, may be mitigated
   to a lesser forfeiture of pay, but cannot be mitigated to other forms of punishment.
   5.5.4. Restraints on liberty (such as arrest, correctional custody, extra duties, and restriction)
   may not be mitigated to forfeitures or reduction in grade because the general nature of the
   punishment would be changed. Arrest in quarters can be mitigated to restriction; correctional
   custody can be mitigated to extra duties or restriction or both; extra duties can be mitigated to
   restriction; but restriction, being the least severe restraint on liberty, cannot be mitigated to a
   different form of punishment. Also, when a restraint on liberty is mitigated, the lesser
   punishment may not run for a period greater than the remainder of the period for which the
   punishment mitigated was initially imposed. For example, when a person is given 15 days of
   correctional custody and has served 5 days of this punishment and correctional custody is
   mitigated to restriction, the mitigated punishment may not exceed restriction for a period of
   10 days.
 30                                                            AFI51-202 7 NOVEMBER 2003


5.6. Remission. See MCM, Part V, paragraph 6c. Remission is simply the cancellation of any
portion of the unexecuted punishment. An unsuspended reduction is executed on imposition. It
can therefore never be remitted, but under appropriate circumstances may be suspended
(paragraph 5.4), mitigated (paragraph 5.5), or set aside (paragraph 5.7).
5.7. Set Aside. See MCM, Part V, paragraph 6d. Set aside occurs when the punishment, or any
part or amount thereof, whether executed or unexecuted, is removed from the record and any
rights, privileges, pay, or property affected by the relevant portion of the punishment are
restored. A set aside of all punishment voids the entire nonjudicial punishment action. A
commander may not set aside punishment more than 4 months after execution of the punishment,
unless the commander determines unusual circumstances exist and explains them in an
attachment to AF Form 3212.
   5.7.1. Set aside is not normally considered a rehabilitation tool, like suspension, remission,
   and mitigation. Commanders should not routinely set aside punishment, but should exercise
   this discretionary authority only in the rare and unusual case where a question concerning the
   guilt of the member arises or where the best interests of the Air Force are served by clearing
   the member's record.
   5.7.2. Setting aside a punishment in its entirety restores the member to the position held
   before imposition of the punishment, as if the Article 15 action had never been initiated. For
   example, if a member has been reduced in grade through Article 15 punishment, and the
   reduction is later set aside, the effec-tive date and DOR reverts to that held before reduction.
   See AFI 36-2604.
5.8. Limitations on Suspension, Mitigation, Remission and Set Aside of Punishment. A
commander can suspend, mitigate, remit, or set aside punishment under Article 15 only if the
commander has the authority to impose that punishment. For example, a commander in the grade
of captain or lieutenant cannot suspend, mitigate, remit, or set aside punishment imposed by a
field grade commander beyond what the captain or lieutenant could impose. A commander not
empowered to act may, of course, recommend suspending, mitigating, remitting, or setting aside
an action to the next superior commander empowered to impose such punishment(s).
5.9. Processing Requirements. Process and file all requests to suspend, mitigate, remit, or set
aside punishment, and any actions taken in response, with the original Article 15 record and
ensure inclusion with other official file copies.

Section 5B—Vacation of Suspension

5.10. General Guidance. Commanders must consult the servicing SJA before taking action to
vacate a suspended nonjudicial punishment. A commander may vacate all or a portion of the
suspended punishment. MCM, Part V, paragraph 6a(5) provides further guidance on vacation
actions.
5.11. Notification to the Member. Except when prevented by unauthorized absence of the
member, the commander completes item 1 of the AF Form 366, Record of Proceedings of
Vacation of Suspended Nonjudicial punishment, signs and dates the form, and causes the
member to be notified and advised of his or her rights, using the form. Normally, the commander
notifies and serves the member, then signs and annotates the date and time the member was
served notice of the proceeding in item 2 of the AF Form 366. Where circumstances prevent the
AFI51-202 7 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                    31


commander from personally notifying and serving the AF Form 366 on the member or the
commander elects not to do so, the commander may direct a subordinate, senior in rank to the
member (when practicable), to notify and serve the member. The subordinate annotates the date
and time of service and signs in item 2 of the AF Form 366 as the person serving the member.
Regardless of who serves the member, provide the member with a copy of both pages of the AF
Form 366. Make available to the member all statements and evidence upon which the
commander intends to rely in making his or her decision.
   5.11.1. The servicing SJA provides a description of the basis for the vacation (i.e.,
   misconduct or failure to meet an additional condition upon which the suspension was based)
   and other information pertinent to the suspended punishment on the AF Form 366.
   5.11.2. If a new commander assumes responsibility for the case after a vacation proceeding
   has been initiated, but before the vacation decision is made, inform the member of the
   identity of the new commander and provide 3 duty days to present matters. The new
   commander accomplishes this either by notifying the member about the change in writing, or
   by withdrawing the old AF Form 366 and initiating a new vacation proceeding on a new AF
   Form 366. If the notification format is used, it becomes an attachment to the AF Form 366.
   5.11.3. Notification of proceedings to vacate suspended NJP may be provided to officers by
   the commander who originally recommended that another commander punish the member
   under Article 15, UCMJ (e.g. the Wing/CC who recommended the NAF/CC punish the
   member). This notification can be provided by modifying the AF Form 366 to include the
   statement, ―Upon receipt of your presentation, if any, the decision to vacate your punishment
   will be made by [Name/Rank of CC].‖
   5.11.4. The member may present matters in defense, extenuation, or mitigation regarding the
   violation on which the vacation action is based.
   5.11.5. The member may make either a written presentation or personal appearance or both.
   If the member elects to make a personal appearance, he or she may personally appear before
   the commander authorized to vacate suspension of the nonjudicial punishment. If such an
   appearance is impracticable due to the unavailability of the commander or by extraordinary
   circumstances, the member may appear before a person designated by the commander who
   will prepare a summary of the personal appearance for the commander. At the personal
   appearance, the member may (a) present evidence; (b) present witnesses who are reasonably
   available; and (c) be accompanied by someone to speak on his or her behalf. There is no
   requirement that a lawyer be made available to accompany the member at the personal
   appearance.
5.12. Member’s Elections. The member has 3 duty days to make his elections. The member
must initial in item 3 of the AF Form 366 whether or not the member consulted a lawyer,
attached a written presentation, or requests a personal appearance before the commander. The
commander may, upon written application, grant an extension for good cause.
   5.12.1. If a member does not reply with his or her elections in time, the commander may
   continue with the proceedings and note in item 3 of AF Form 366 "member failed to
   respond" and initial. The member's failure to respond in time does not prevent the
   commander from continuing with the vacation proceedings. However, if the commander has
 32                                                           AFI51-202 7 NOVEMBER 2003


   reason to believe a failure to respond resulted from reasons beyond that individual's control,
   the commander may not, without good cause, proceed with vacation proceedings.
5.13. Timing. Vacation of a suspension must be based on the violation of the condition(s) of
the suspension and occur within the period of suspension. See paragraph 5.4.4. To vacate a
suspension, the commander must present the member with the AF Form 366 before the end of
the suspension period. The suspension period is stayed if the probationer has been properly
notified via AF Form 366 during the suspension period. The member's unauthorized absence also
interrupts the suspension period. For example, if a member is absent without leave for 10 days,
the period of suspension is extended 10 days.
5.14. Commander's Decision.
   5.14.1. Following full and fair consideration of the evidence, including any matters
   presented by the member, the commander indicates one of the following actions in item 4a of
   the AF Form 366 by marking or initialing the appropriate block on the form:
       5.14.1.1. The vacation proceedings are terminated because vacation of the suspended
       punishment is not appropriate or because the member did not violate the condition(s) of
       the suspension.
       5.14.1.2. The member violated one or more of the conditions of the suspension. The
       commander lines out and initials any violations for which vacation of the suspended
       punishment is not appropriate or which the member did not violate.
   5.14.2. The commander completes item 4 of the AF Form 366, and signs and dates the form
   in the indicated blocks.
       5.14.2.1. If the commander terminates the proceedings, the original AF Form 366 is sent
       to the servicing SJA for appropriate AMJAMS entries. The AF Form 366 is then
       destroyed.
       5.14.2.2. Punishment is recorded in item 9 of the AF Form 366 as a continuation of
       4.a(2).
   5.14.3. At the time a commander informs the member of the vacation decision, the
   commander directs the member to acknowledge the action taken on the proceedings of
   vacation of suspended nonjudicial punishment and that there is no right to appeal by signing
   and dating item 5 of the AF Form 366.
       5.14.3.1. If the member refuses to acknowledge receipt of the vacation action, the
       commander will note in item 5 "member refused to acknowledge receipt of vacation
       action" and initial.
5.15. Effect on Suspended Reductions. If a reduction in grade is suspended, but the
suspension is later vacated, the DOR in the grade to which the member is reduced is the date the
original reduction was imposed by the commander. The effective date, however, is the date of
the vacation action. See AFI 36-2604. For example, if the commander imposed Article 15
punishment on 1 June, consisting of a suspended reduction in grade for 6 months, and the
commander subsequently vacates the suspension on 2 September, the effective date of the
reduction is 2 September, but the member's new DOR is 1 June. Pay is not retroactively
recouped.

                                MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS

Section 6A—Indorsing Forms and Correspondence

6.1. Procedure. Prepare any indorsements to AF Form 3070 using normal correspondence
practices. Send the correspondence involved in processing NJP (including prescribed forms)
through command channels, except as provided in paragraph 6.8. Unless specifically prescribed,
each intermediate commander decides whether to add matters of substance by indorsement. If so,
they are signed as noted below.
6.2. Content of Indorsements:
   6.2.1. Any intermediate commander or delegee may recommend action or provide other
   information that might help the superior commander in arriving at a decision.
   6.2.2. Following actions by appropriate authority, any intermediate commander, delegee, or
   staff officer signing under the authority line may furnish information (including
   administrative instructions) to the member or to a subordinate commander by indorsement.
6.3. Copies. Copies of Article 15 documentation are reproduced from the signed original. The
SJA ensures copies of all documents and attachments that will comprise the record of
punishment, as set forth in paragraph 6.11, are provided to the member and to each level of
command involved.

Section 6B—Action Taken on Records of Punishment, Including Vacation, Suspension,
Mitigation and Set Aside Actions

6.4. Action by the Commander. The commander who imposed the punishment or who took
action to vacate, suspend, mitigate, remit, or set aside, sends the record to the servicing SJA for
review, comment, and recommendation as appropriate.
   6.4.1. If the punishment includes unsuspended correctional custody, the commander
   immediately notifies the correctional custody monitor of the details, including inclusive
   dates, to begin the punishment.
   6.4.2. Before sending the AF Form 3070 to the servicing SJA, but after completing all other
   action, including appeal, the commander imposing punishment indicates it item 9 (for AB –
   TSgt) or item 10 (for Senior NCOs) whether the NJP record will be filed in an enlisted
   member's Unfavorable Information File by initialing, signing and dating the appropriate
   block. The imposing commander should make this determination even in cases that were
   appealed. However, if the imposing commander is not available, any person authorized by
   AFI 36-2907, Unfavorable Information File (UIF) Program, may make the UIF
   determination. UIFs are mandatory for officers who receive NJP, which is noted in item 9 of
   the AF Form 3070C.
       6.4.2.1. It is within the commander’s discretion to provide the member with an
       opportunity to respond to the UIF decision, regardless of whether the entry of the NJP
       record in the UIF is mandatory or optional.
 34                                                           AFI51-202 7 NOVEMBER 2003


       6.4.2.2. In a joint or combined command or task force, if an officer assigned to a
       different service imposed NJP on an Air Force member, the Air Force officer identified
       in AFI 36-2907 must make the UIF decision.
       6.4.2.3. The member acknowledges that he or she was informed about the commander's
       UIF, selection record, and appeal decisions, as applicable, by signing and dating the
       ―Member’s Acknowledgement‖ block on the AF Form 3070. If the member refuses to
       sign, the commander will note "member refused to sign" in this block and initial.
6.5. Action by the Servicing SJA. The SJA or designated attorney reviews the NJP action for
legal sufficiency if no appeal is taken, or after the member acknowledges action on the appeal
and the imposing commander returns the record to the servicing SJA. The reviewing attorney
signs and dates the ―Servicing SJA Legal Review‖ block of the AF Form 3070 (or of the AF
Form 366 or 3212, when applicable) when the record is found legally sufficient. The NJP action
is final at that point and admissible in courts-martial for purposes of RCM 1001(b)(2). This is
also the final action for purposes of the timeliness metric as recorded in AMJAMS. In officer and
senior NCO cases, do not delay completion of servicing SJA legal sufficiency review for
completion of selection record processing.
   6.5.1. The SJA then sends:
       6.5.1.1. One copy of the record to the officer who supervises the correctional custody
       program when the case involves unsuspended correctional custody.
       6.5.1.2. Two copies of the record, with an AF Form 1373, MPO Document Control Log-
       Transmittal, to the Accounting and Finance Office (AFO) if the punishment affects the
       member's pay. The SJA keeps a copy of the AF Form 1373. The person who provided the
       copies of the record to AFO will date and initial the appropriate part of the ―MPF and
       AFO Distribution‖ block of the AF Form 3070 (or of the AF Form 366 or 3212, when
       applicable) or mark "N/A" if not applicable.
       6.5.1.3. One copy of the record to the unit UIF monitor if the record will be filed in a
       UIF. The unit UIF monitor is responsible for ensuring entry into a UIF. See AFI 36-2907
       for detailed procedures.
       6.5.1.4. One copy of the record to the servicing MPF, with an AF Form 1373, in all
       cases. The SJA keeps a copy of the AF Form 1373. The person who provided the copy of
       the record to MPF will date and initial the appropriate part of the ―MPF and AFO
       Distribution‖ block of the AF Form 3070 (or of the AF Form 366 or 3212, when
       applicable).
       6.5.1.5. The original record (and two complete copies for officer cases) directly to the
       SJA for the officer exercising general court-martial convening authority, after providing
       the record to the MPF and AFO and noting the date of receipt. File the receipted copy of
       AF Form 1373 as prescribed in paragraph 6.12.
       6.5.1.6. In cases involving O-6 selects and above, one copy of the record and all
       supporting documents to the member's commander for forwarding IAW AFI 90-301. See
       paragraph 1.5. In all cases where the incident was investigated by Air Force Office of
       Special Investigations or Security Forces, provide the investigating office with sufficient
       information on final disposition to fulfill their respective reporting requirements.
AFI51-202 7 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                        35


6.6. Action by the Military Personnel Flight (MPF). The MPF, on receiving the record,
acknowledges receipt on a copy of the AF Form 1373 and returns this form to the servicing SJA
and takes appropriate personnel actions.
6.7. Action by the GCMCA SJA. The GCMCA SJA or designated attorney performs an
administrative supervisory review on behalf of the GCMCA and returns legally deficient
proceedings for correction. The reviewing attorney signs and dates the ―GCMCA SJA
Administrative Supervisory Review‖ block of the AF Form 3070 (or of the AF Form 366 or
3212, when applicable) when the record is in compliance with AFI 51-202 and sends a copy of it
to the servicing SJA.

Section 6D—Effect of Errors in Nonjudicial Punishment Proceedings

6.9. Effect of Errors. See MCM, Part V, paragraph 1h. An NJP proceeding is not legally
sufficient if it contains an error that materially prejudices a substantial right of the member. If
such an error exists and cannot be remedied within the same proceeding, the appropriate NJP
authority sets aside the defective NJP action. A new action may be initiated but any punishment
imposed as a result of an additional proceeding may be no more severe than that originally
imposed. See MCM, Part V, paragraph 7f(3). If a material error exists and can be remedied
within the same proceeding without prejudicing the member's rights, reflect the correction,
whenever possible, as a pen and ink change on the form (i.e., AF Forms 3070, 366 or 3212)
initialed and dated by the commander and the member. However, if a pen and ink change will
not result in a clear and unambiguous corrected record, the commander, by indorsement to the
form, should notify the member of the error and thoroughly explain the correction to the record.
The member signs an acknowledgment to the commander's indorsement. The indorsement and
acknowledgment become an attachment to the form.
   6.9.1. Administrative or clerical errors and minor errors that do not materially prejudice a
   substantial right of a member do not require correction to make the NJP proceeding legally
   sufficient. However, such errors may be corrected with pen and ink changes in the manner
   described above.

Section 6E—Disposition of Records of Nonjudicial Punishment Proceedings

6.10. Governing Directive. The disposition of records of NJP is governed by the Air Force
Records     Disposition    Schedule    (RDS)      located   at    https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
af61a/afrims/afrims/. SJA offices are authorized to destroy copies of NJP records after three
years, or when no longer needed, whichever is later. See RDS, Table 51-3, Rule 27.
6.11. Contents of Record. The record of punishment consists of the AF Form 3070, the
decision letter under AFI 36-2608, Military Personnel Records System, and if applicable, AF
AFI51-202 7 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                        37


Forms 366, 3212, and any of their attachments. Examples of attachments are additional pages
for punishment or statement of offenses, change of commander notifications (paragraphs 3.9.3
and 3.10), waivers of the statute of limitation (paragraph 3.13.4), withdrawals of request for trial
(paragraph 3.22), and indorsements correcting errors requiring explanation (paragraph 6.9).
6.12. Supporting Documentation. Evidence and other written materials considered as a basis
for imposing punishment, or vacating a suspended punishment, or submitted by the member in
mitigation, extenuation, or defense or on appeal are supporting documentation and not part of the
record. Supporting documentation also includes summaries of a member's oral presentation,
initiating commander indorsements for appeals, and legal reviews for an appellate authority. File
such evidence and other written materials in the office of the servicing SJA of the commander
who initiated the Article 15 as attachments to the file copy of the action, except for AF Form
1373. AF Forms 1373 are maintained separately from the Article 15 file, and in chronological
sequence.

      RECOUPMENT OF EDUCATION ASSISTANCE, SPECIAL PAY, OR BONUSES

I understand that the Air Force may be entitled to recoup a portion of education assistance,
special pay, or bonus money which I received, if any, if I separate before completing the period
of active duty I agreed to serve. I understand this recoupment applies regardless whether I
voluntarily separate or I am involuntarily discharged. I further understand: (1) the recoupment in
all cases is an amount that bears the same ratio to the total amount or cost provided to me, as the
unserved portion of active duty bears to the total period of active duty I agreed to serve; and (2)
that if I dispute that I am indebted for educational assistance, a board or other authority will
make findings and recommendations concerning the validity of the indebtedness.
