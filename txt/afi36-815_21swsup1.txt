The OPR for this supplement is 21 MSS/DPCE (Ms. Siobhan P. Berry). This supplement implements and
extends the guidance of Air Force Instruction (AFI) 36-815, Absence and Leave, 5 Sep 02. This supple-
ment describes 21st Space Wing (SW) procedures for use in conjunction with the basic AFI. This supple-
ment applies to all personnel serviced by the Civilian Personnel Flight (DPC), 21st Mission Support
Squadron (21 MSS), Peterson AFB CO. Maintain and dispose of records created as a result of prescribed
processes in accordance with AFMAN 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule (will become AFMAN
33-322 Vol 4).

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document has been substantially reduced due to sufficient guidance currently provided in latest revi-
sion of AFI 36-815. A minor change was made in paragraph 1.2.3.6. (Added) to identify the bargaining
unit and in paragraph 2.10.1.4. to reflect current reorganization changes. 21 SW Form 325, Application
Voluntary Leave Transfer Program, has been made obsolete by this supplement. Forms are now properly
identified throughout the supplement as Information Management Tools (IMT) in keeping with current
Air Force nomenclature. A bar ( | ) indicates revision from the previous edition.
1.2.2. Authority to approve leave is delegated to first-level supervisors.
1.2.3.6. (Added) Supervisors of bargaining unit employees must be familiar with and apply the require-
ments in the Memorandum of Agreement between Peterson AFB Complex and Local 1867, American
Federation of Government Employees, pertaining to scheduling, requesting, and approving leave for bar-
gaining unit employees.
2.10.1.4. The following officials are designated as approval authorities for exigencies causing cancella-
tion of leave for employees in their organizations: For NORAD/USNORTHCOM, the Chief of Staff and
directors; for HQ AFSPC, the Director of Staff and directors; for wings, the Vice Commander and group
commanders; for others, direct reporting unit commanders and tenant unit commanders. For employees

reporting directly to any of the designated officials above, the approval authority for exigencies is the next
higher level official.
2.10.2. 21 SW IMT 298, Request for Approval of Exigency, and 21 SW IMT 298A, Request for
Approval of Restoration of Forfeited Annual Leave, are used to coordinate the process of restoring
cancelled leave. As soon as it is known that leave must be cancelled and forfeiture is unavoidable, the
supervisor submits a completed 21 SW IMT 298 to the appropriate approval authority for approval or dis-
approval. A copy of the approved or disapproved IMT is provided to the Workforce Effectiveness Section
(21 MSS/DPCE).
2.10.2.6. (Added) The employee initiates a written request for restoration of leave (21 SW IMT 298A),
with the approved exigency attached (21 SW IMT 298) and submits it through the appropriate supervisory
chain to 21 MSS/DPCE for review within 30 calendar days after the end of the leave year.
3.5.3.1. (Added) Counsel the employee, include a detailed explanation of why the employee is sus-
pected of sick leave abuse, and warn that if the practice continues, medical documentation may be
required for all absences for which sick leave is requested.
3.5.3.2. (Added) Document the counseling on a Memorandum for Record (MFR) and attach to the AF
IMT 971, Supervisor’s Employee Brief. The employee should be given the opportunity to sign or initial
the MFR or AF IMT 971 annotation. The MFR is retained until no longer needed, pending grievance,
appeal, Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) complaint, or unfair labor practice.
3.5.3.3. (Added) If the counseling does not resolve the suspected sick leave abuse, give the employee a
Letter of Leave Requirement that medical documentation is required for every period of absence for
which sick leave is requested or used. Include specific reasons why the employee is suspected of sick
leave abuse. The supervisor coordinates the Letter of Leave Requirement with 21 MSS/DPCE before
issuing to the employee.
3.11.3. Procedures for requesting advance sick leave:
3.11.3.1. (Added) The employee submits a completed 21 SW IMT 322, Request for Advance Sick
Leave, to his or her supervisor along with an OPM Form 71, Request for Leave or Approved Absence,
for approval or disapproval.
3.11.3.2. (Added) When the supervisor receives the request for advance sick leave, he or she coordinates
with 21 MSS/DPCE before making a decision. The supervisor notifies the employee in writing if the
request is disapproved and why. If the request is approved, the supervisor endorses 21 SW IMT 322 and
submits to 21 MSS/DPCE.
4.2. Amount of LWOP. Employees will normally contact 21 MSS/DPCE for an out-processing and
benefit counseling appointment 1 week prior to going on LWOP. At that time, they are provided a Bene-
fits Summary for Civilian Employees on LWOP. This document provides specific procedures for employ-
ees to follow to either cancel or continue Federal Health Benefits.
4.4. Who Approves LWOP. As a basic condition for approval of LWOP, supervisors must reasonably
expect that an employee will return to duty at the end or during the approved period. Supervisors may
grant LWOP for 30 days or less without completing a Request for Personnel Action (RPA), except when
LWOP is for an absence resulting from an on-the-job injury. In this case, if the LWOP extends, or is
expected to extend for 80 hours or more, an RPA must be completed.

8.1.1. (Added) Civilian employees must clear all required organizations on their last duty day using 21
SW IMT 237, Civilian Personnel Base Clearance Sheet. The Workforce Effectiveness Section (DPCE),
21 MSS, provides the IMT in duplicate to separating employees. Employees may be granted up to 3 hours
of duty time to clear the base. Supervisors may approve additional time, if necessary. Employees remain
in a paid duty status during the clearance process. Employees who abuse the clearance time period may be
placed in an Absent Without Leave (AWOL) status. Employees cannot clear base after their last day in
duty status. Should an employee fail to clear, his or her supervisor must complete the clearing process on
the next duty day. The clearance is not complete until 21 MSS/DPCE has received and signed the 21 SW
IMT 237.
8.8.1. (Added) Employees with fewer than 80 hours of sick leave to their credit are eligible to use 4
hours of excused absence each leave year for preventive health screenings. Examples of preventive health
screenings include, but are not limited to screening for prostate, cervical, colorectal, and breast cancer,
blood lead level, and blood cholesterol level.
