This change is effective immediately. CFETP 3E1X1, dated May 2007 changes as follows:

 1. The CFETP is revised to clarify Part II, Section A, Specialty Training Standard. This
change rescinds portions of Change 1 and further incorporates proficiency codes from the
Heating Ventilation Air Conditioning and Refrigeration 7- level Course Training Standard
(CTS) dated 28 Sep 05 into the CFETP dated May 07. All proficiency codes identified will be
placed in the 7-level column of the Specialty Training Standard. Items 8.3.4,11.7, 11.7.1,
11.7.2, 12.1.13, 13.2.4, 13.13, 13.13.1, 13.13.2, and 13.13.3 are being added to ensure all items
trained under the original CTS are listed in the Specialty Training Standard. A proficiency
code has been added to Line Item 11.6.1. A supplement to the CDCs has also been
incorporated into this change.

2. The following items need to be rescinded from CFETP3E1X1C1 published 1 Feb 11.
