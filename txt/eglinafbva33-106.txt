                         INFOCON LEVELS

 INFOCON presents a structured, coordinated approach to defend
 against and react to adversarial attacks on DoD
 computer/telecommunication systems and networks.
                   INFOCON levels are as follows:
INFOCON 5: Routine NetOps: Normal readiness of information
systems and networks that can be sustained indefinitely.
INFOCON 4: Increased Vigilance: In preparation for operations or
exercises, with a limited impact to the end user.
INFOCON 3: Enhanced Readiness: Increases the frequency of
validation of information networks and its corresponding
configuration. Impact to end-user is minor.
INFOCON 2: Greater Readiness: Increases the frequency of
validation of information networks and its corresponding
configuration. Impact to administrators will increase and impact to
end-user could be significant.
INFOCON 1: Maximum Readiness: Addresses intrusion techniques
that cannot be identified or defeated at lower readiness levels. Only
implemented in limited cases. Could be significant impact on
administrators and end-users.
