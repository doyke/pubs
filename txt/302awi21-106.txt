1. Responsibilities.
   1.1. The responsibilities for aircraft debriefing are shared between the Aircraft Maintenance Squad-
   ron (AMXS) expeditor/crew chiefs and the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC). The AMXS
   expeditor/crew chiefs are responsible for: the “face to face” aircrew debriefing at the aircraft; fill-
   ing-out a 302 AW Form 15, Flight Debrief Worksheet, and faxing the completed 302 AW Form 15
   to the MOC. In addition, AMXS expeditor/crew chiefs will ensure that a copy of the last five sortie
   302 AW Form 15s are filed in the aircrafts Air Force Technical Order (AFTO) 781 Aircraft Forms
   Binder to allow for repeat and recurring discrepancy identification. MOC responsibilities include:
   reviewing the 302 AW Form 15s for accuracy; identifying repeat and recurring discrepancies; and
   inputting aircraft debrief information into GO81. In addition, the MOC is required to maintain the
   Debriefing Record Files.

2. Procedures.
    2.1. Debriefing is required for all sorties/flights and ground aborts. The AMXS expediter/crew chief
    will gather all possible information concerning the termination of the sortie from all personnel
    involved.
    2.2. The AMXS expeditor or crew chief will thoroughly debrief aircrews to ensure all discrepancy
    data is entered on AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document.
    2.3. The AMXS expeditor or crew chief will review the last five 302 AW Form 15s to check for
    repeat/recurring discrepancies. If found, any repeat/recurring discrepancies will be annotated, in red,
    in the discrepancy block of the aircraft AFTO Form 781A. Repeat/recurring discrepancies will also be
    annotated in the appropriate block on the 302 AW Form 15.
    2.4. The AMXS expeditor or crew chief will then copy the debrief write-ups from the AFTO Form
    781 Aircraft Forms Binder to the 302 AW Form 15, and fax the 302 AW Form 15 to the the Mainte-
    nance Operations Center (MOC) at 719-556-6555 (DSN 834-6555) within 30 minutes of the conclu-
    sion of the aircrew debrief. Any exceptions will be coordinated with the MOC. In addition, copies of
    the last five debrief worksheets will be filed in the AFTO 781 Aircraft Forms Binder for future refer-
    ence.
    2.5. MOC will review and enter the debrief information into GO81. Prior to entering the new discrep-
    ancies, the MOC will review the last five sorties 302 AW Form 15s located in the MOCs Debriefing
    Record File to check for any repeat or recurring write-ups. The MOC will document all flight crew
    reported discrepancies in the G081 system using program 9050 with the appropriate discovered codes
    (A, B, C, or D.).
    2.6. In the event that the G081 Maintenance Information System (MIS) is inoperative or not avail-
    able, debriefing will be accomplished using the 302 AW Form 15. Once the GO81 system comes back
    on line, the MOC will ensure that all data from the manual debrief is loaded into G081.
    2.7. When advance notice of a specific malfunction is received, MOC will coordinate to ensure spe-
    cialists are available to attend debriefings.
    2.8. MOC will alert Quality Assurance (QA) during normal duty hours for all air/ground aborts and
    incidents. After normal duty hours, AMXS personnel will notify MOC via the night log of all inci-
    dents and air/ground aborts. When QA personnel are not available, AMXS personnel will accomplish
    302 AW Form 16, Abort/Incident Record, as fully as possible. The AMXS will then fax the form to
    the MOC; who will then notify QA at the next possible opportunity to ensure adequate investigation.
    Sufficient copies of 302 AW Form 16 will be kept in the aircraft forms to accommodate Abort/Inci-
    dent reporting when the aircraft is away from home station.
    2.9. In the event that G081 is inoperative or not available (cross-country, deployments), the AMXS
    expeditor/crew chief responsibilities remain the same; enter the debrief information on the worksheet
    and insure that the worksheet is delivered to the MOC. Once G081 becomes operational/available, the
    MOC will ensure that all data is loaded into the system.
    2.10. The AFTO 781 Aircraft Forms Binder form data will be delivered to Plans & Scheduling
    (PS&D) for processing into the MIS.
    2.11. After MIS input, PS&D will deliver the AFTO Form 781 Aircraft Forms Binder flight forms to
    Operations prior to the 0900 Daily Scheduling Meeting.
