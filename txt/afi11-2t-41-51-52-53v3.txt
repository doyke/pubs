                                               Chapter 1

                                    GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Scope. This instruction outlines the procedures applicable to the safe operation of the
aircraft. Along with the complementary references cited, this instruction prescribes standard
operational procedures to be used by all pilots operating the aircraft. Certain procedures may be
identified as only applicable to or not applicable (NA) to the ANG. Units will provide local
operating procedures in a supplement to this publication. Note: Service contracts may further
restrict operations.
1.2. Pilot’s Responsibility. In conjunction with other governing directives, this instruction
prescribes procedures under most circumstances, but is not to be used as a substitute for sound
judgment or common sense. The pilot in command (PIC) is ultimately responsible for the safe
and effective operation of the aircraft and will ensure all occupants of the aircraft comply with
this directive.
1.3. Deviations. Do not deviate from the procedures and guidance in this publication except
when necessary to preserve safety or protect lives. In that case, the PIC has ultimate authority
and responsibility for the course of action to be taken and will take the appropriate action to
safely recover the aircraft. Report all deviations without waiver through channels to the
MAJCOM OPR.
1.4. References. The primary references for aircraft operations are this instruction and technical
orders (TO) 1T-41D-1, Flight Manual, USAF T-41D Series Aircraft, TO 1T-51A-1, Flight
Manual, USAF T-51A Series Aircraft, TO 1T-53-1, Flight Manual, USAF T-53 Series Aircraft,
or TO 1T-52A-1, Flight Manual, USAF T-52A Series Aircraft. Training units may develop phase
manuals from the procedures contained in these documents. Phase manuals may be used to
augment initial and mission qualification training. They may expand these basic procedures, but
will not be less restrictive. Only maneuvers described in these references will be flown.
1.5. Waivers. HQ USAF/A3O-A is the waiver authority for training requirements established
by AFI 11-202, Volume 1, Aircrew Training. Except where noted herein, the MAJCOM A3 is
the waiver authority for this instruction. Submit waiver requests in message or memorandum
format to the OPR.
1.6. Crew Requirements. The minimum crew for the T-41 or T-51 is one pilot in the left seat.
The minimum crew for the T-52 or T-53 is one pilot. All aircrew members will be qualified
according to AFI 11-2T-41-51-52-53, Volume 1, T-41, T-51, T-52, and T-53 Aircrew Training.
1.7. Maximum Flight Duty Period Flight Time. AFI 11-202, Volume 3, lists maximum flight
duty periods.
     1.7.1. Units will consider the aircraft as “trainer” type aircraft.
     1.7.2. Use of additional crewmembers to extend the flight duty period (augmented crew) is
     not authorized.
1.8. Clothing Requirements. AFI 11-301, Volume 1, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE)
Program, prescribes minimum aircrew clothing requirements. In the absence of specific
AFI11-2T-41-51-52-53V3 12 MARCH 2010                                                         5


guidance, all aircrew members will wear flight suits and flight boots, or MAJCOM-approved
uniforms while operating the aircraft.
   1.8.1. Aircrew will carry appropriate seasonal flight clothing. Aircrew members will remove
   rings and scarves before performing aircrew duties.
   1.8.2. Aircrew will wear flight gloves during ground operations, except when straining fuel,
   and during departures, recoveries, and critical phases of flight.
1.9. Seatbelts and Shoulder Harnesses. All occupants will wear seatbelt and shoulder
harnesses (front seats only) at all times while operating the aircraft.
1.10. Oxygen Requirements. The PIC will ensure oxygen is used in accordance with AFI 11-
202, Volume 3. Units will ensure only certified personnel service oxygen equipment. Pilots on
supplemental oxygen will perform a pressure, regulator, indicator, connections, and emergency
(PRICE) check every 30 minutes.
1.11. Cargo Restrictions. None.
1.12. Interfly. Interfly requires approval of both operations group commanders and notification
of the appropriate numbered AF and MAJCOM standardization and evaluation office.
1.13. Aerial Events. Units will conduct aerial events in accordance with AFI 11-209, Aerial
Event Policy and Procedures.

                                      MISSION PLANNING

2.1. Responsibilities. The individual pilots and the operations functions of the organizations
jointly share responsibility of mission planning. The PIC is ultimately responsible for mission
planning.
2.2. General Procedures. The pilots will:
     2.2.1. Accomplish sufficient flight planning to ensure safe mission accomplishment. AFI 11-
     202, Volume 3, and this instruction specify minimum requirements.
     2.2.2. Compute or obtain weight and balance, and takeoff and landing performance for each
     flight. MAJCOM-approved tabulated data may be used when available.
     2.2.3. Ensure all passengers are manifested in accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 3.
     2.2.4. (NA to ANG) Only file visual flight rules (VFR) flight plans according to AFI 11-202,
     Volume 3.
2.3. Briefings and Debriefings. The PIC is responsible for presenting a logical briefing that
promotes safe, effective mission accomplishment. All pilots will attend the flight briefing and
debriefing. The PIC will structure the flight briefing to accommodate the capabilities of each
pilot. Passengers will be briefed on their specific responsibilities related to safe mission
accomplishment. On subsequent flights during the same day with the same crew, the PIC must
brief only those items that have changed from the previous flights.
     2.3.1. Briefing Guides:
        2.3.1.1. All missions will be briefed and debriefed, using the applicable briefing guide as
        a reference (Attachments 2 and 3). Note: Briefing guides are reference lists of items that
        may apply to particular missions.
        2.3.1.2. Items listed may be briefed in any sequence. Those items covered by phase
        manuals or written squadron standards, and understood by all participants may be briefed
        as “standard.” Each guide may be expanded as necessary to cover other important items
        of the flight. Brief only those items applicable to the particular mission and in sufficient
        detail to prevent any misunderstanding between crewmembers.
     2.3.2. Alternate Missions:
        2.3.2.1. Pilots will brief an alternate mission profile for each flight. The alternate mission
        will be less complex than the primary mission. Exception: If the primary mission is a
        pattern-only sortie, an alternate mission is not required.
        2.3.2.2. Missions or events not briefed will not be flown. Solo student pilots will not
        deviate from the briefed primary or alternate mission profile. Mission elements or events
        may be briefed airborne if it is practical to do so and flight safety is not compromised.
2.4. Maps and Charts:
AFI11-2T-41-51-52-53V3 12 MARCH 2010                                                             7


   2.4.1. A local sectional and VFR terminal area charts must be on board the aircraft. When
   flying outside the local area, appropriate charts covering the route of flight must be on board
   the aircraft. Current charts produced by Falcon View may be substituted.
   2.4.2. Pilots will ensure low-level charts or route books identify the location and dimensions
   of class A, class B, class C, and class D airspace; civil and military airfields; and other
   potential high density traffic areas (restricted areas, military operating areas, alert areas,
   parachute activity areas, and ultra light, hang glider, or glider sites, etc.) within 5 nautical
   miles (nm) of any planned route. Pilots will annotate and brief applicable airfield approach
   control and tower frequencies, and the intersections of published military training routes.
2.5. Required Documents. The following documents must be on board for flight:
   2.5.1. Aircraft weight and balance report.
   2.5.2. Airworthiness certificate.
   2.5.3. Aircraft registration.
   2.5.4. AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document. (Note: AFTO Form

                          NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

3.1. Preflight:
   3.1.1. Required Equipment. Chapter 4 specifies the minimum equipment required for
   flight.
   3.1.2. Aircraft Systems. Students will not fly solo in aircraft requiring an operational
   check. Pilots may perform operational checks during dual student training sorties if the
   checks do not interfere with training objectives.
   3.1.3. Foreign Object Damage (FOD). To reduce the risk of FOD and personal injury,
   personnel will ensure loose items are secured in the cockpit at all times.
   3.1.4. Preflight Inspections:
       3.1.4.1. If the issued survival kit is missing or its inspection is overdue, contact the
       Aircrew Flight Equipment. A squadron operations officer must approve any flight with a
       survival kit that has an overdue inspection. The OG commander must approve any flight
       without a supplied survival kit.
       3.1.4.2. Visually check fuel quantity prior to every flight. Check fuel samples for
       impurities and proper type after every refueling and before the first flight of the day. Fuel
       should be allowed to settle for 30 minutes to an hour to obtain the most valid sampling. If
       the sample is good, pour back into tank or follow local procedures for sump fuel. If the
       sample is bad, immediately contact local refueling and maintenance personnel.
       3.1.4.3. Pilots will not hand-prop the aircraft. If the pilot confirms the master and
       ignition switches are off with the ignition key removed, the propeller may be turned to
       facilitate ground handling or to loosen congealed oil prior to cold starts. This does not
       constitute hand-propping.
       3.1.4.4. If the aircraft requires the use of external power to start the engine for the first
       sortie of the day, personnel will notify maintenance and make an entry in the AFTO Form
       781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document. Only maintenance personnel will
       connect and disconnect the external power source. If the aircraft requires the use of
       external power to start on any subsequent flight, abort the aircraft and make an entry in
       the AFTO Form 781A.
       3.1.4.5. Aircraft remaining off-station overnight will carry chocks, tie-downs, and extra
       engine oil.
3.2. Ground and Taxi Operations:
   3.2.1. Refueling Operations. Personnel not actively involved in refueling will remain at
   least 50 feet away from an aircraft refueling operation. In addition, do not operate the engine,
   taxi, or radiate electromagnetic energy (radio, distance measuring equipment [DME], cell
   phones, or transponder operation) within the 50 feet safety zone.
   3.2.2. Ground Handling:
10                                                  AFI11-2T-41-51-52-53V3 12 MARCH 2010


     3.2.2.1. Pilots will ground handle the aircraft whenever minimum wingtip clearances will
     be compromised during taxi.
     3.2.2.2. A qualified pilot or maintenance personnel must supervise ground handling.
     Note: Personnel will use extreme caution when ground handling aircraft. Improper
     ground handling may result in structural damage.
     3.2.2.3. Do not use the empennage (tail section) to ground handle or turn the T-41 or T-
     51.
  3.2.3. Prior to Starting Engine:
     3.2.3.1. Pilots will ensure a fire bottle is in the vicinity prior to engine start.
     3.2.3.2. When starting behind another aircraft, pilots will ensure a minimum of 10 feet
     nose-to-tail separation.
  3.2.4. Engine Start:
     3.2.4.1. A qualified pilot or maintenance personnel will perform all engine starts.
     Exception: Student pilots may start the engine under the supervision of an IP.
     3.2.4.2. If the engine fails after warmup for no apparent reason, abort the aircraft. Enter
     all engine failures or abnormalities on the AFTO Form 781A to include the total time the
     engine ran.
  3.2.5. After Engine Start. Pilots will:
     3.2.5.1. Not onload or offload personnel or equipment while the engine is running.
     3.2.5.2. Use proper tailwind, headwind, and crosswind control inputs while taxiing. Use
     caution to avoid upsets due to strong jet or propellor blast from larger aircraft. If aircraft
     control is lost during taxi, the pilot will immediately shut down the engine.
     3.2.5.3. Avoid taxiing through snowdrifts and significant accumulations of ice. To avoid
     damage to the propeller, pilots will plan to taxi around gravel and puddles of water and
     avoid high power settings on the ground (greater than 1500 RPM) when possible. When
     damage to the prop tips is likely, pilots will maintain full aft elevator control unless wind
     conditions dictate otherwise.
     3.2.5.4. Avoid rolling over any cables or arresting gear during taxi, takeoff, or landing.
  3.2.6. Minimum Spacing and Taxi Interval. Comply with the minimum taxi clearances in
  AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground. In addition, maintain:
     3.2.6.1. At least 50 feet behind light single-engine aircraft.
     3.2.6.2. At least 100 feet behind multi-engine or jet aircraft.
     3.2.6.3. A minimum of 500 feet behind taxiing helicopters.
  3.2.7. Wind Limitations. When the wind exceeds 35 knots, pilots will turn the aircraft into
  the wind and cease all taxi operations. If a tow is required, shutdown the engine, set the
  parking brake, and wait for the tow to arrive.
AFI11-2T-41-51-52-53V3 12 MARCH 2010                                                              11


   3.2.8. Engine Runup. Do not perform an engine runup while an aircraft is stopped or
   taxiing in front of your aircraft. Do not taxi in front of another aircraft performing an engine
   runup.
3.3. Takeoff and Landing:
   3.3.1. Runway:
       3.3.1.1. All takeoffs and landings require prepared surface runways. The minimum
       runway required for normal operations is 2,500 by 40 feet or the sum of the takeoff and
       landing rolls, whichever is greater.
          3.3.1.1.1. Do not take any headwind component into account when computing
          takeoff and landing distances. The squadron commander may approve operations
          considering up to one half of the steady state headwind component to compute
          takeoff and landing distances.
          3.3.1.1.2. Do not consider runway prior to above-ground aircraft arresting cables as
          usable for takeoff. Do not consider runway after above-ground aircraft arresting
          cables as usable for landing. The OG commander may approve operations on shorter
          runways when the takeoff and landing distances do not exceed 80 percent of the
          usable runway.
       3.3.1.2. Do not take off or land over a raised web barrier (for example, MA-1A or BAK-
       15) unless the minimum runway and the planned rate of climb will clear the barrier by 35
       feet.
       3.3.1.3. Intersection takeoffs are approved as long as the usable runway remaining meets
       the minimum requirements of paragraph 3.3.1.1. When aircrews use less than the entire
       runway for takeoff, base takeoff data calculations on the actual runway remaining from
       the point where takeoff starts.
       3.3.1.4. The minimum runway condition reading (RCR) for takeoff or landing is 12. In
       the absence of RCR, pilots will use braking action reports to determine runway condition.
       Pilots will not takeoff or land with braking action reported as poor. Pilots will not take off
       or land if the existing crosswind component exceeds the RCR.
   3.3.2. Weather Requirements:
       3.3.2.1. The maximum density altitude for T-41 takeoffs above 2,350 pounds gross
       weight is 9,500 ft.
       3.3.2.2. The maximum density altitude for T-51, T-52, or T-53 takeoffs is 10,000 feet.
   3.3.3. Minimum Runway Spacing. Reduced same runway separation is authorized in
   accordance with AFI 13-204, Volume 3, Airfield Operations Procedures and Programs.
3.4. Fuel Requirements. Pilots will:
   3.4.1. Plan all missions to land with a minimum of 7 gallons (T-41 or T-52) or 5 gallons (T-
   51 or T-53) of usable fuel remaining.
   3.4.2. Declare minimum fuel to the controlling agency when it becomes apparent an aircraft
   will land at the base of intended landing with less than the required fuel reserve.
 12                                                AFI11-2T-41-51-52-53V3 12 MARCH 2010


      3.4.2.1. With 7 gallons (T-41 or T-52) or 5 gallons (T-51 or T-53) usable fuel or less,
      declare minimum fuel.
      3.4.2.2. With 5 gallons (T-41 or T-52), 4 gallons (T-53), or 2.5 gallons (T-51) usable fuel
      or less, or when both tanks indicate less than 1/8 full, whichever occurs first, declare
      emergency fuel.
3.5. Minimum Altitudes:
   3.5.1. The minimum en route altitude is 1,000 feet above ground level (AGL). Exception:
   The OG commander may approve T-51 pilots to fly actual National Intercollegiate Flying
   Association (NIFA) competition checkpoint overflights down to 500 feet AGL when
   required by NIFA judges.
   3.5.2. The minimum altitude during simulated forced landing (SFL) training is 500 feet
   AGL. Exceptions: An SFL flown to a prepared surface runway may be flown to touchdown.
   The unit may designate specific areas for SFL training down to 200 feet AGL with an IP in
   the aircraft. The unit will ensure these specific areas are surveyed annually and make
   aircrews aware of obstacles in the vicinity.
3.6. In-flight Weather Requirements:
   3.6.1. (NA to ANG) All operations will remain in visual meteorological conditions as defined
   in AFI 11-202, Volume 3. Note: Flight in weather near minimums presents increased risks
   even for experienced pilots. Pilots will use judgment to land or reverse course rather than fly
   in marginal conditions. When forecast winds, visibility, or ceiling reach or exceed limits,
   pilots will carefully consider routes and fuel requirements for possible diversions.
   3.6.2. If lightning or thunderstorms are reported within 10 nm of the area of operation, pilots
   will ensure the aircraft is not exposed to hail, lightning, windshear, or microbursts. Units will
   terminate operations with lightning within 5 nm.
   3.6.3. Flight in forecasted severe turbulence requires OG commander approval. If severe
   turbulence is reported, cease operations in the affected area.
   3.6.4. Units will publish procedures to limit operations when wind chill or outside air
   temperatures (low or high) could affect safety. (See AFI 11-418, Operations Supervision.)
3.7. IP-Required Maneuvers:
   3.7.1. Practice SFL to other than a runway.
   3.7.2. Practice unusual attitudes and recoveries.
3.8. Instrument and Navigation Procedures:
   3.8.1. (NA to ANG) Simulated instrument flight and practice instrument approach procedures
   are not authorized.
   3.8.2. (NA to ANG) The Bendix/King KLN 94™ Global Positioning System (GPS) installed
   in the T-41, the Cirrus Perspective Avionics System installed in the T-53, and the Garmin
   G1000 integrated avionics system installed in the T-52 are approved for use as mission
   enhancement systems in accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 3. They are not approved for
   instrument navigation.

   3.8.3. Portable GPS use is authorized in AFI 11-202, Volume 3.
   3.8.4. The minimum airspeed during point-to-point navigation is the no-wind, flaps-UP (no
   flap) final approach speed. Flaps will remain in the up/zero position during point-to-point
   navigation. Pilots will increase airspeed to prevent continuous stall warning during point-to-
   point navigation.
3.9. Night Procedures. -(NA to ANG) Pilots will not take off prior to morning civil twilight at
lighted airports or official sunrise for unlit airfields. Pilots must land before the end of evening
civil twilight at lighted airfields or before official sunset for unlit airfields.
3.10. Passenger Procedures:
   3.10.1. The PIC will brief passengers according to the mission briefing guide in Attachment
   2 and the passenger briefing guide in Attachment 3.
   3.10.2. AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, lists passenger approval authorities and
   restrictions. In addition, passengers will not control the aircraft during critical phases of flight
   (takeoff, landing, and traffic patterns) or below 1,000 feet AGL.
3.11. Simulated Emergency Procedures:
   3.11.1. The PIC will brief all airborne simulated emergencies before flight.
   3.11.2. Do not practice compound or multiple simulated emergencies in-flight.
   3.11.3. Do not initiate simulated emergencies below 300 feet AGL.
3.12. Nontowered Airfield (NTA) Operations:
   3.12.1. With the OG commander’s approval, aircrews may conduct operations at
   nontowered, public-use airfields as follows:
       3.12.1.1. Aircrews will monitor the published common traffic advisory frequency and
       make all radio calls and position reports recommended in the Aeronautical Information
       Manual                      (AIM)                     available                     at
       http://www.faa.gov/airports_airtraffic/air_traffic/publications/ATpubs/AIM/.
       3.12.1.2. Pilots may fly rectangular patterns (as depicted in AIM) and emergency
       procedures patterns.
       3.12.1.3. Aircrews will immediately notify the operations supervisor if any hazardous
       conditions exist at an NTA that would prevent normal operations.
   3.12.2. Each OG commander will require and approve a training program to prepare
   aircrews to operate in the NTA environment. As a minimum, the program will include a
   discussion of all applicable codes of federal regulations, advisory circulars, and AIM
   references on NTA operations. Training will emphasize standard civilian radio phraseology.
   This training may be conducted during initial or mission qualification training.
3.13. Functional Check Flights (FCF): -(NA to T-52)
   3.13.1. Do not conduct an FCF with other type missions except FCF continuation training or
   FCF upgrade training flights. All FCF requirements will be accomplished by an FCF pilot or
   a pilot in training status with an FCF IP on board.

   3.13.2. The OG commander may waive a complete FCF and authorize an FCF to check only
   systems disturbed by maintenance, inspection, or modification.
   3.13.3. Maneuvers not according to TO 1T-41D-6CF-1, Technical Manual -- Functional
   Check Flight Manual, USAF Series T-41D ACFT, or TO 1T-51A-6CF-1, Technical Manual -
   - Functional Check Flight Manual, USAF Series T-51A ACFT, will not be flown or practiced
   on FCF missions.
3.14. Transfer of Aircraft Control. Both pilots must know who has control of the aircraft at
all times. In all cases:
   3.14.1. The pilot assuming control of the aircraft will state, “I have the aircraft” and will
   shake the yoke or stick. Once assuming control of the aircraft, maintain control until
   relinquishing it.
   3.14.2. The pilot relinquishing control will state, “You have the aircraft.”
3.15. Post Flight. After flight, aircrews will:
   3.15.1. Complete the AFTO Form 781 and notify maintenance of discrepancies.
   3.15.2. Ensure the aircraft is tied down or hangared if it will be left unattended. Ensure the
   aircraft is chocked in an appropriate parking spot. If the forecast includes winds greater than
   30 knots, the pilot will tie down the aircraft at the wings and tail.
