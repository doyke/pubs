 2                                                 TRAVISAFBI21-201 5 FEBRUARY 2013


1. General.
     1.1. The 60 Maintenance Group (MXG) Commander (CC) and 60 Operations Group (OG)
     CC have joint responsibility for effective management of the unit FCF program. The success
     of this program begins with cooperation between the Operations and Maintenance
     communities. Quality Assurance (QA) will work with the OG FCF Officer-In-Charge (OIC)
     to develop a viable program.
     1.2. While OCFs are different in origin, the procedures established for conducting a FCF
     will be followed for the OCF as well. Documentation for the Operational Check Flight will
     be annotated as “OCF” on the AF Form 2400, Functional Check Flight Log.
2. FCF Procedures.
     2.1. The 60 OG/OGV is the OPR for C-5, KC-10, and C-17 FCF flights at home station.
         2.1.1. The 60 OG/OGV will work with the local Travis Boeing Site Manager along with
         the Systems Group (SG) at Wright-Patterson AFB to schedule a C-17 FCF.
     2.2. Crews will be appointed by the 60 OG/CC. FCF crew members will be highly qualified
     individuals from the following positions: OG/OGV evaluators, squadron evaluators Formal
     Training Unit instructors, or squadron flight instructors.
     2.3. 60 OG/CC will brief the 349 OG/CC if 349th crew members are involved.
     2.4. C-5 FCF functions are conducted by the 339 Flight Test Squadrons (FLTS) DOV,
     Warner-Robins AFB, GA or the 312 Airlift Squadron. Prior to requesting Warner-Robins
     aircrews to perform FCF, a crew activation letter must be provided to the 60 MXG Resource
     Advisor to provide an authorized fund-cite for the 339 FLTS.
     2.5. All crew members will attend the debrief after completion of every FCF/OCF.
3. OCF Procedures.
     3.1. OCFs occur when maintenance determines a condition exists that cannot be
     operationally checked out or troubleshot while the aircraft is on the ground, and does not
     meet the criteria for an FCF. OCF aircrews do not need to be FCF qualified to fly OCF
     missions, but they must be highly experienced as determined by the applicable squadron
     supervision.
4. High-Speed Taxi Checks.
     4.1. Travis aircrews do not currently perform High-Speed Taxi checks for C-5, KC-10 and
     C-17 aircraft. In the event a High-Speed Taxi is required at Travis AFB the 60/349
     OG/OGV Standardization/Evaluation Division (along with the local Travis Site Manager
     and the SG at Wright-Patterson AFB for C-17 aircraft) will develop the required checklist.
5. Maintenance Squadron Responsibilities.
     5.1. Review the mission design series Dash-6 Technical Orders to ensure that any completed
     modifications or maintenance/repair actions necessitate an FCF/OCF.
     5.2. Notify QA when aircraft requires an FCF/OCF.
     5.3. Notify QA when aircraft is ready for Key Task Listing (KTL) inspection.
TRAVISAFBI21-201 5 FEBRUARY 2013                                                              3


   5.4. Document the FCF/OCF in the aircraft forms I.A.W. instructions in T.O. 00-20-1.
   5.5 Configure the aircraft for FCF/OCF according to technical data and local directives.
   5.6. Ensure a highly qualified individual as determined the applicable squadron supervision,
   who performed maintenance on the affected system attends both the initial FCF/OCF briefing
   and after flight debrief to provide any necessary inputs to flight activities.
   5.7. If needed, supply a highly qualified individual as determined by the applicable squadron
   supervision for in flight operational checks.
6. 60/349 MXG Quality Assurance Responsibilities.
   6.1. Conducts Quality Verification Inspection (QVI) on KTL item.
   6.2. Establish a QA point of contact (POC) for the FCF/OCF.
       6.2.1 QA POC will contact 60/349 MXG/CC and inform them of the (FCF/OCF).
   6.3. Establish a POC from each of the following offices:
       6.3.1. Operations Group Standardization/Evaluation (FCF/OCF OIC).
       6.3.2. Applicable Squadron Maintenance Supervision.
       6.3.3. Plans, Scheduling, and Documentation (PS&D).
       6.3.4. QA Weight and Balance (W&B).
   6.4. Contact the aircrew to coordinate the sequence of events for the FCF/OCF.
   6.5. Contact PS&D to schedule the FCF/OCF.
   6.6. Schedule the date, time and location for FCF/OCF briefing. Attendees include: QA,
   AMXS supervision, FCF/OCF aircrew and a highly qualified individual who performed
   maintenance on the affected system.
   6.7. Debrief all FCF/OCF aircrew with the appropriate debrief function using the FCF
   checklist and aircraft forms to ensure all requirements have been accomplished.
   6.8. Annotate AF Form 2400 and forward copy to PS&D for inclusion in the aircraft jacket
   file.
   6.9. Ensure all completed copies of the Dash-6CL is forwarded to PS&D.
7. Plans, Scheduling, and Documentation (PS&D) Responsibilities.
   7.1. Coordinate the scheduling of the FCF/OCF with maintenance and applicable aircrew
   and post information to the weekly and monthly flying schedules in the 60 MXG database.
