               AIR UNIVERSITY EQUAL OPPORTUNITY POLICY
                                               The Air University plays a unique role in educating
                                            and training the current and future Air Force leaders.
                                            Our people are our top priority and deserve to work in an
                                            environment where everyone is treated with dignity and
                                            respect. In doing so, we promote a working climate that
                                            inspires trust, teamwork, and pride. I have a zero-
                                            tolerance policy towards discrimination and sexual
                                            harassment -- both are demeaning to our people and
                                            detrimental to our mission.

                                               To maintain a working environment free from
                                            unlawful discrimination and sexual harassment, we must
                                            all understand, embrace, and enforce equal opportunity
                                            and treatment standards. I expect all Air University
                                            commanders and supervisors will:

1) Set the example by embracing the concepts of Equal Opportunity and Treatment (EOT) in
   their daily speech and actions;

2) Enforce EOT standards by promptly investigating allegations of unlawful discrimination,
   taking action to end it, and disciplining those that violate Air Force EOT standards;

3) Assure anyone having grievances may voice them without fear of retaliation; and

4) Ensure their people are trained in EOT.

  The bottom line is, sexual harassment or unlawful discrimination of any kind, at any
time, will not be tolerated within The Air University.

                                                           Lieutenant General, USAF
                                                           Commander and President, Air University
