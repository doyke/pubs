This instruction establishes guidance concerning network security accountability on all networks
and information systems provided by the 21st Space Wing (21 SW). This instruction
implements AFI 33-138_21SWSUP, Enterprise Network Operations Notification and Tracking
and AFI 33-200 Information Assurance (IA) Management. This includes all systems located on
Peterson AFB (including tenant units) and geographically separated units (GSU). All personnel
assigned or attached to Peterson AFB, including contractors fulfilling contractual duties, are
responsible for sustaining the integrity, availability and confidentiality of the information
transported on the 21 SW’s networks and information systems. This responsibility includes
complying with all applicable policies, directives, regulations, and statutes. We also have a
responsibility to ensure the appropriate classification and marking of all information on the
network. A network security incident is any activity, event, or action that violates policy,
guidance, or directives; introduces additional vulnerabilities; or increases risk to the network or
the 21 SW information systems. A classified message incident (CMI) is a security incident that
results in the inappropriate transfer of information on a system, applications, or media which is
below the classification of the information. All personnel must comply with AFI 33-332, Air
Force Privacy Act Program, for documents containing privacy act information. All personnel
must comply with DOD Regulation 5200.1-R, Information Security Program and USD (I)
Memorandum Interim Information Security Guidance, for documents containing For Official
Use Only information. This publication applies to members of the Air Force Reserve and Air
National Guard. Refer recommended changes and conflicts between this and other publications
to office of primary responsibility, on Air Force (AF) Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication. Failure to observe the prohibitions and mandatory provisions in Paragraphs 4.3.1.
thru 4.3.6., and 8 of this publication is a violation of Article 92 of the UCMJ, or that
noncompliance may result in punishment under Article 92 of the UCMJ. Ensure that all records
created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with

        Commander must contact the 21st Mission Support Group Commander to request
        remediation.
        4.3.6. Unit Commanders will ensure users are counseled or disciplined for first offenses.
        Repeat offenses will result in disciplinary action as the Unit Commander deems
        necessary.
        4.3.7. The required training         is   located    at:      http://iase.disa.mil/eta/online-
        catalog.html#iaatraining
5. DATA TRANSFERS. Users will follow IA policy regarding electronic file transfer.
Improper transfer will initiate a security incident, and could result in a compromise. Users will
contact their IAO for assistance with data transfer. Improper transfer will be reported to the
applicable security manager and 21 SW IA.
     5.1. High-to-low: This transfer is when a user takes unclassified information from a
     classified system and moves it to an unclassified system. This type of transfer is NOT
     AUTHORIZED unless there is a waiver to CTO 10-133 on file exempting the system and
     user and an approved Cross Domain Solution is used to make the transfer.
     5.2. Low to high: This transfer is when a user takes unclassified information from an
     unclassified system and moves it to a classified system. Unclassified information/records are
     to be maintained on unclassified systems, unless they are needed to complete or update
     classified information/records. Low-to-high transfers are approved but will be accomplished
     as follows:
        5.2.1. Use only CD or DVD optical disks (no re-writeable disks).
        5.2.2. Do not use flash media.
        5.2.3. Ensure the session is “closed” after the files are written to the disk(s).
        5.2.4. Once the disk is inserted into the classified system it will take on the classification
        of the system.
