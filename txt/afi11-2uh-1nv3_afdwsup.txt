series for cross country flights, reduces the crew compliment for NVG Low Level/NVG
 2                                           AFI11-2UH-1NV3_AFDWSUP 7 AUGUST 2013


Formation from 2 pilots, 1 flight engineer and 1 additional scanner to 2 pilots and 1 flight
engineer, assigns AFDW/A3 as the approval authority for interservice interfly.
1.3. Waivers and deviations will be routed through 811 OG/OGV to HQ AFDW/A3.
2.1.1. For contingency operations, command authority will be in accordance with classified
OPLANS.
2.2. Operations in a CBRN environment are IAW OPLAN guidance.
2.4.5. An interservice interfly exists any time an aircrew is made up of members from more than
one service or an aircrew member of one service is flying aircraft owned by another service for
operational missions. In accordance with HAF/A3O-AI guidance, AFDW/A3 is approval
authority for interservice interflys.
2.5.1. Flight Engineer Training. The unit will develop a formal training syllabus to train flight
engineers on their duties while in the left front seat and basic navigational skills. Following
completion of this training, the unit’s letter of certification/qualification will be updated.
2.5.1.1. (Added) FEs will not occupy the left front seat for flights until they have been
properly trained, except when under direct supervision of an Instructor Flight Engineer.
2.5.1.2. (Added) At no time, other than safety of flight situations (i.e. donning CBRNE gear,
NVGs, seat adjustment and other safety of flight activities deemed essential by the aircraft
commander), will FEs manipulate the flight controls. If the AC deems a safety of flight situation
exists, FEs will only manipulate the controls until the situation is resolved. Additionally, ACs
must comply with AFI 11-202V3, paragraph 1.7. (Note: The AFDW FM 103 meets the intent
of filing a report).
2.5.1.3. (Added) To facilitate FE flight control capabilities in a safety of flight situation, FEs
should be given time on the controls in the UH-1N simulator IAW AETC Simulator Refresher
Syllabus of Instruction.
2.5.2. (Added) Contingency Missions. Minimum crew for actual contingency missions
supporting OPLANS is a contingency-certified aircraft commander and a contingency-certified
FE/pilot.

2.6. DOD 4515.13-R lists eligible passengers for “Space required (mission essential traffic)”
category, but does not fully address many situations for USAF helicopter transport operations.
The following guidance expands upon DOD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation Eligibility, or USAF
helicopter-specific operations and provides guidance for helicopter passengers.
2.6.1.1. (Added) Mission Supported Passengers (MSP). A sub-category of space required
passenger and defined as DoD and other government agency personnel who require helicopter
transportation to satisfy their specific mission requirements. Examples of MSP include personnel
being transported from one location to another (other than MEP) to satisfy their support
requirements, personnel transported for contingency missions (actual or training), or personnel
transported for unique purposes such as aerial surveys, observation, or photography. Approval
for MSP status is normally provided by the mission tasking. However, the OG/CC may designate
MSP status to any DoD personnel (military or government civilian) other than General officers
and equivalent.
2.6.1.2. (Added) AFDW/A3 will coordinate approval for MSP status for all non-DoD
personnel. DoDD 4500.56 and DOD 4515.13-R provides guidance on approval authority for
non-DoD personnel. Other mission support requests will be coordinated with the OG, WG and
AFDW/A3 as required.
2.6.1.3. (Added) Organizations/personnel outside the 811 OG requesting helicopter transport
must submit the request in writing (email is acceptable) to the 11 WG/CC. The request will

include the military organization and office of primary responsibility requesting the support, a
point of contact, and a list of passengers to be transported. The passenger list will include rank
for military, pay grade for government civilians, and the name of the company for civilians
working as a DoD contractor.
2.6.2.1. (Added) Operational Support Airlift (OSA). Headquarters AF/CVAM will task
AFDW helicopters (with AF/CV approval) for all DoD senior officials (except general officers
on flight orders) and members of congress IAW DODD 4500.56, DoD Policy on the Use of
Government Aircraft and Air Travel, and DODD 4515.12, DoD Support for Travel of Members
and Employees of Congress, for transport flights either within or outside the NCR. (Note:
Transport flight refers to the movement of personnel where passengers get off the aircraft at a
point other than the origin (passenger on-load point).
2.6.2.2. (Added) OSD Programs. OSD program offices will task and approve passengers for
contingency operations in the National Capital Region.
2.6.2.3. (Added) Missions tasked by AFDW/A3 will be given in writing (email is acceptable)
and state date(s), time(s), mission purpose, and approved passengers or types of passengers
approved for transport. For example, AFDW/A3 may task the 1 HS with supporting a
photography mission and approve any DoD military photographer.
2.6.2.4. (Added) Approval and tasking process. All transport requests and approvals will be
documented in writing (email is acceptable). The 1 HS will keep a record of all requests and
approvals for 60 days after mission completion.
2.6.4. In accordance with AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, manifest all personnel on DD
Form 2131, Passenger Manifest, or an approved substitute, according to mission requirements.
2.6.4.1. (Added) Missions tasked by OSD Program Offices will include a passenger list or, in
the tasking, state the passenger list is on file with the supported organization.
2.15.1. Training/Exercise Sorties: 40 knots steady state or a 20-knot gust spread.
2.16.3. (Added) Single-pilot NVG operations: 700/2.
2.17.3. Weather at the departure point must be at or above the published minimums (ceiling and
visibility) for the lowest compatible non-precision approach, but no less than ½ mile (2400
RVR).
2.17.3.1. (Added) 1 HS/CC or DO may waive requirements to the published minimums for a
compatible precision approach, but no lower than 200 foot ceiling and ½ mile visibility (2400
RVR).
2.17.3.2. (Added) Single Pilot Simulated Instrument Flight. Minimum weather for single pilot
simulated instruments is 3000-foot ceiling and 5-mile visibility. Pilots must maintain VMC and
remain in radar contact with ATC at all times.
2.21.3. (Added) Forced or Precautionary Landing Reporting. Aircrews that experience an in-
flight emergency (IFE), precautionary landing, terminate a sortie due to the failure of any aircraft
system or other unsafe event(s), must complete an AFDW Form 103, In-Flight Emergency and
Precautionary Landing Worksheet. Submit the original form to the unit flight safety office upon
return to home station. While off station, fax or e-mail the form to unit flight safety office or
