                          EXTERNAL INTELLIGENCE TRAINING

3.1. Introduction. There are two types of EIT: Aircrew Intelligence Training (AIT) and Force
Protection Intelligence Training (FPIT). AIT will be coordinated with the wing/group tactics
flight or officer. FPIT will be coordinated with force protection (FP) organizations (e.g.,
Security Forces (SF), Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI)) as defined in AFI 14-
119, Intelligence Support to Force Protection. (T-2)
     3.1.1. AIT is EIT provided to the units’ assigned and attached aircrew and operators. The
     assigned Intelligence Weapons Instructor Course or Intelligence Sensor and Weapons
     Instructors Course graduate will be directly responsible for the management of the AIT
     program. (T-3)
     3.1.2. FPIT is EIT provided by the host unit intelligence function to the unit’s SF and other
     FP support agencies (e.g., AFOSI, Civil Engineering). FPIT will be conducted IAW AFI 14-
     119 and supporting documents. When possible, a FP Intelligence Formal Training Unit
     graduate will be responsible for the management of the FPIT program. If the intelligence
     function is not part of the host unit, the tenant unit responsibilities in AFI 14-119 will be
     adhered to. (T-3)
     3.1.3. Effective training methods will be used and can include, but are not limited to
     briefings, demonstration-performance, formal and informal lectures, and academic training
     sessions. (T-3)
     3.1.4. Training resources can include, but are not limited to threat briefings, current
     intelligence briefings, theater orientation briefings, CDs/DVDs or web-based training
     materials, and weapons system videos. (T-3)
3.2. SIO Responsibilities. The SIO will:
     3.2.1. Establish an EIT program tailored to the unit’s mission, weapons systems, projected
     wartime/Air and Space Expeditionary Force tasking and base/deployment location(s). (T-2)
     3.2.2. Appoint program managers to oversee program execution. (T-3)
     3.2.3. Assign only qualified trainers to conduct unsupervised EIT. AFI 14-2E-8, Volumes 1
     and 2 identify specialized training requirements and evaluation criteria for EIT trainers. (T-
     3)
     3.2.4. Ensure written guidance outlines procedures for conducting, documenting, testing,
     evaluating, monitoring and reporting EIT. (T-3)
     3.2.5. Coordinate EIT written instructions with all applicable commanders. Written
     guidance will be coordinated with any agency that assists intelligence personnel in providing
     training, as well as, any agency for which intelligence training is provided on a regularly
     scheduled basis. (T-3)
     3.2.6. Develop intelligence training for other base/unit personnel, if appropriate. (T-3)
3.3. Aircrew Intelligence Training.

     3.3.1.1. Build an effective training program, including training plans, with input from
     operational squadrons, tactics representatives, aircrew flight equipment (AFE) personnel,
     and Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) specialists, as appropriate. (T-2)
     3.3.1.2. Review training objectives for currency prior to the beginning of the training
     cycle. (T-3)
     3.3.1.3. Actively solicit feedback to ensure training objectives are meeting training
     requirements. (T-3)
     3.3.1.4. Conduct trend analysis following each training cycle; document lessons learned
     and apply those lessons during subsequent cycles. (T-3)
     3.3.1.5. Provide a written evaluation of the wing/group AIT program to the appropriate
     commander(s) at the end of each training cycle. The written evaluation will include at a
     minimum: the percent or number of personnel trained; trend analysis (e.g., high miss
     questions, weak areas); and corrective actions taken. Incorporate feedback as applicable.
     (T-3)
  3.3.2. Squadron intelligence personnel will:
     3.3.2.1. Provide input to and execute the AIT program. (T-2)
     3.3.2.2. Provide questions and answers specific to the squadron's mission for the unit
     master question file (MQF). (T-3)

     3.3.2.4. Document AIT provided. Documentation of AIT will include the names of
     personnel receiving training, date training was accomplished, the topic taught, and the
     name of the trainer conducting the training. In addition, they will provide a written
     evaluation of the squadron’s AIT program to the squadron commander and the SIO (see
     Attachment 2). (T-3)
  3.3.3. The AIT plan will be specifically tailored to meet unit/mission requirements. Teach
  each item in the AIT training plan at least once during the training cycle. Evaluate the
  objectives for each AIT category with a test. Personnel covered by the training plan will pass
  each test with a minimum score of 85% correctable to 100% via a review of the missed test
  items with an EIT trainer. (T-3)
  3.3.4. Prorate training based on unit contingency operations tempo IAW the appropriate AFI
  11-2MDS, Volume 1. Details of the prorating schedule must be outlined in the AIT Plan
  and/or other written instructions. (T-3)
  3.3.5. Training categories include threat knowledge, visual recognition (VR), collection and
  reporting (C&R), and personnel recovery (PR). Include other categories based on the unit’s
  mission as required. (T-2)
     3.3.5.1. Threat Knowledge Training. Develop specific threat knowledge training
     objectives tailored to the PR unit mission, local area, deployment base(s), and forward
     operating locations. Concentrate on threats in selected countries with the potential for
     direct unit involvement. Refer to attachment 3 for minimum standards for threat
     briefings. The references listed at the beginning of this instruction can be supplemented

       environment, based on unit mission and operations plan (OPLAN)/concept of operations
       plan (CONPLAN) tasking. Identify key differences between friendly weapons systems
       and threat weapon system look-alikes. Incorporate all aspects/angles, theater specific
       paint schemes, national markings and various configurations. Include examples of
       weapons employment to illustrate how threats might appear when employed (e.g., muzzle
       flashes, smoke plumes, burst patterns). Training should teach aircrew/operators how to
       describe threats they encounter to assist intelligence personnel in positive identification.
       3.3.5.3. Collection and Reporting Training. Collection and reporting training will focus
       on items necessary to enable aircrew to initiate aircrew-originated reports (e.g., In-flight
       Report (INFLTREP), Communications Instructions Reporting Vital Intelligence
       Sightings) and familiarize them with the information requirements of the intelligence-
       generated Mission Report (MISREP) and Intelligence Report. A critical component of
       C&R training will be the unit’s essential elements of information (EEI). Training will
       identify and describe theater-specific and peacetime reporting requirements.
       3.3.5.4. Personnel Recovery Operational Support Training. When assigned, a SERE
       specialist will conduct PR operational support training. The SERE specialist will
       coordinate PR operations support training requirements with intelligence and AFE
       personnel and document these requirements in a memorandum of agreement (MOA).
       Units without SERE personnel will coordinate an MOA with AFE and operations. This
       category will be omitted if intelligence personnel do not provide any PR operational
       support training to aircrew. If intelligence personnel do provide PR operational support
       training, address as a minimum: PR materials (Isolated Personnel Report (ISOPREP)
       maintenance and review, evasion plan of action (EPA) preparation) and theater combat
       recovery procedures.
