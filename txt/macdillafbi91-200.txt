2. General. A timely, efficient mishap notification system is essential to the conduct of thorough mishap
investigation. Good, timely mishap investigations should result in corrective actions of a meaningful
nature. In this manner, recurrences are avoided. Mishap accountability and validation are also essential to
ensure an awareness of mishaps and the circumstances involved in each incident. Concern for mishap
cause factors is not dependent on severity. The fact that a mishap has occurred, even one with minor dam-
age or injury, is just cause for concern and management interest.

3. Responsibilities.
