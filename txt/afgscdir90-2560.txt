SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Compliance items
and references have been updated to reflect recent AFI 11-415 changes. Table 1 has been
restructured to clarify MAJCOM, Wing, Operations Support Squadron, and operational squadron
functions and responsibilities.
1. Compliance and Standardization Requirements Lists (C&SRL) are the primary lists used
during the HQ AFGSC/IG Compliance Inspection (CI), to assess unit compliance with
established guidance governing each particular area of operations. Items defined in this C&SRL
are defined by the AFGSC staff and based upon existing “by-law” requirements, Executive
Orders, DoD directives, and Service policy and guidance. C&SRL compliance items also
include mission areas deemed critical by AF, AFGSC and ANG leadership to assess and assure
unit organizational health and/or performance. The objective of the C&SRL is to identify
deficiencies that preclude attainment of required capabilities.

2. Critical Compliance Objectives (CCO) represent the highest priority of inspection items and
are fundamentally derived from the Common Core Compliance Areas (CCCA) and the
fourteen mission areas defined in AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities. Lower tier Core and
General Compliance Items may be stand alone or subordinate to a CCO. During the CI, it is the
intent of the AFGSC/IG to inspect, as a minimum, 100 percent of the CCOs that apply to the
inspected unit. However, C&SRL items listed do not limit the scope of the inspection. Critical,
core and general compliance criteria are defined as follows:
2.1. Critical Compliance Objective (CCO). An item where a unit’s failure to comply with
established guidance could result in significant liabilities, loss of life or serious injury or
significant mission impact. Key mission areas are:
2.1.1. Airman development programs
2.1.2. Ability to deploy forces
2.1.3. Ability to employ forces

2.2. CCOs are shown in BOLD AND ALL CAPS FORMAT.

2.3. Core Compliance Item (CCI). An item or area that requires special vigilance and is
important to the overall performance of the unit, but is not deemed "Critical." Non-compliance
would result in some negative impact on mission performance or could result in injury or
possible litigations. CCIs are shown in ALL CAPS FORMAT.
2.4. General Compliance Item (GCI). An item or area deemed fundamental to successful
overall performance of the unit. Non-compliance would result in minimal impact on mission
accomplishment or would be unlikely to result in injury or possible litigation. GCIs are shown in
sentence case format
