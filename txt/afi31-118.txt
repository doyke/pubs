                          FUNCTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Headquarters Air Force Director of Security Forces (AF/A7S). Provides and develops
policy and guidance for Security Forces programs in order to protect USAF installations from
terrorism, criminal acts, sabotage and acts of war.
1.2. Headquarters Air Force Security Forces Center (HQ AFSFC). Provides Air Force
commanders with guidance on implementation of Security Forces programs.
1.3. Major Command Security Forces (MAJCOM/A7S). Establishes command unique
programs and policies to ensure protection of command installations, personnel and resources.
1.4. Installation Commander. Installation commanders are responsible for all operations
performed by their installation, including Integrated Defense (ID) operations.
1.5. Defense Force Commander (DFC). Designates Security Forces programs to protect
installation personnel and resources. The title Defense Force Commander is synonymous with
Chief of Security Forces (CSF) and Senior Antiterrorism Officer (ATO) and may be used
interchangeably.

                                             Chapter 2

                              SECURITY FORCES PERSONNEL

2.1. Security Forces Mission Statement. Security Forces protect, defend and fight to enable
USAF, Joint and Coalition missions.
2.2. Security Forces Vision. Mission-ready, resilient and air-minded SF organized, trained and
equipped to deliver enduring integrated defense against threats to the Air Force, Joint and
Coalition missions; recognized and respected for our air-centric expertise.
2.3. Military Ethics and the Security Forces Code of Conduct. AFI 1-1, Air Force
Standards, provides a set of ethical principles for Airmen and Air Force Civilian Police/Security
Guard (DAF CP/SG) to live by in their professional and personal life. By practicing these ethical
standards, all SF personnel will live and work in a manner consistent with Air Force values. The
Security Forces Code of Conduct (Attachment 2) provides career field specific standards to help
SF Airmen and DAF CP/SG understand how to translate Air Force ethics into their day-to-day
job. It is built on the premise that Security Forces’ fundamental duty is to serve the community,
and the shield and beret is a symbol of public faith and trust. As a public servant, it is the
Security Forces’ duty to remain above reproach and a higher standard of conduct is demanded
and expected. The Security Forces Pledge (Attachment 3) captures the spirit and intent of the
Code of Conduct.
2.4. Security Forces General Orders. Security Forces duties and responsibilities can vary
greatly from one location to another, but the General Orders overarch the entire spectrum of SF
duties and serve as an important guide while in the performance of those duties. The number of
posts as well as their limits and responsibilities are determined locally. However, the basic
General Orders remain the same. The general orders are as follows:
     2.4.1. I will take charge of my post and protect personnel and property for which I am
     responsible until properly relieved. SF members have been entrusted with the protection of
     personnel and resources and, as such, will not leave nor abandon any post. SF personnel will
     stay within post limits, until proper relief has occurred. This is true regardless of how long
     one has been posted and regardless of conditions. In the event of an extenuating
     circumstance, the second General Order below provides further guidance.
     2.4.2. I will report all violations of orders I am entrusted to enforce and will call my
     superior in any case not covered by instructions. SF members have the authority to
     apprehend anyone violating those orders. If any situation arises that is not covered by written
     instructions, SF personnel will contact their superiors for guidance. If an SF member cannot
     contact superiors, they must exercise discretion and act according to training, best judgment
     and common sense.
     2.4.3. I will sound the alarm in case of disorder or emergency. SF members must report
     any event threatening security of the installation or endangering life or property.
     Additionally, they will take reasonable actions to save lives and property.
2.5. The Department of the Air Force Civilian Police/Security Guard (DAF CP/SG)
Program. The DAF CP/SG program is an integral part of Integrated Defense, which is a core
function of the USAF SF. Both military and civilian police have equal roles in day-to-day
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                           9


operations. These operations include active and passive defense measures employed across the
legally-defined ground dimension of the operational environment to mitigate potential risks and
defeat adversary threats, as well as to promote public order and efficient military operations. Law
and Order Operations directly contribute to an installation’s ID and encompass many special
disciplines. These include crime prevention, criminal investigations, corrections, traffic
enforcement, access control and military working dogs. DAF CP/SGs are not only an integral
component, but are fully integrated into SF units. The integration of DAF CP/SGs into SF units
is a unit responsibility. DFCs, operations officers, SF Managers (SFM) and other senior squadron
personnel must work together to build a cohesive SF unit. For further guidance refer to AFI 31-
122, Department of the Air Force Civilian Police/Security Guard (DAF CP/SG) Program. For
the purposes of this instruction DAF CP/SG are considered SF, unless there are specific issues
requiring DAF CP/SG be addressed separately.
2.6. Security Forces Quick Reference Guide. All SF members, regardless of rank, need to
become extremely familiar with maneuvering through the e-publishing web site in order to
access policy and guidance information quickly and efficiently. Security Forces use a multitude
of policies and guidance publications, such as: Air Force Policy Directives (AFPDs), Air Force
Manuals (AFMANs), Air Force Instructions (AFIs), Air Force Handbooks (AFHs), Career Field
Education and Training Plans (CFETPs), Air Force Joint Instructions (AFJIs) and many
additional types of references and guidance publications. The most up-to-date AF forms and
publications can be found at the Air Force and DoD electronic-publications websites online.
   2.6.1. Security Forces use publications for day-to-day operations. Series 10 (Operations), 31
   (Security) and 36 (Personnel) are a few examples, but are not all encompassing.
       2.6.1.1. Series 10 publications incorporate AF operational policy and guidance, e.g., AFI
       10-245, Antiterrorism.
       2.6.1.2. Series 31 publications incorporate all Security Forces policy and guidance.
       2.6.1.3. Series 36 publications incorporate policy and guidance affecting AF personnel.
       AFI 36-2646, Security Forces Training and Standardization Evaluation Programs, is an
       example of a 36 series AFI SF utilize.
       2.6.1.4. With respect to the Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM), specific areas to
       understand are Rules for Courts-Martial (RCM): Rule 302, Military Rules of Evidence
       (MRE); Rules 304, 305, 313 - 317, 321; and Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)
       Articles 2, 5, 7, 31, 32, 77 - 134 (Offense Elements) and 136.
   2.6.2. Security Forces will adhere to MAJCOM and local policy and guidance which may
   not be found at the above listed locations. For MAJCOM and local policies, refer to the local
   SF unit’s operations section.
 10                                                                  AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


                                            Chapter 3

                   SECURITY FORCES UNIFORM AND EQUIPMENT

3.1. General Information. Security Forces must wear a distinctive uniform for quick
identification. SF personnel are constantly in the public eye, so they must set the highest standard
of dress and appearance. AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel,
contains guidance on proper wear of SF uniforms. AFI 31-122 stipulates DAF CP/SG badges,
dress and appearance standards.
3.2. The Security Police/Forces (SP/SF) Shield. Uniformed SF members wear the SP/SF
shield. Do not abuse this symbol of authority. AFI 31-206 (under review and will be published as
AFI 31-115, Security Forces Investigations Program) establishes procedures for display of the
shield by SF investigators not in uniform. The following guidelines apply to the issue and wear
of the shield:
   3.2.1. Wear the metallic shield only on the blue uniform combinations.
   3.2.2. SF members are issued their shield upon graduation from the Security Forces
   Apprentice Course. SF units may purchase and issue badges to authorized SF personnel.
   3.2.3. The DFC may elect to present the shield to retiring Security Forces members.
   Additionally, the DFC may elect to present the shield to the next of kin of Security Forces
   members who have died while on active duty.
   3.2.4. As the USAF specialty most closely associated with the enforcement of good order
   and discipline on an installation, SF of all grades must set the example for others to follow
   on/off-duty. The conduct of SF members must be above reproach at all times. Should a
   member’s conduct not conform to this standard and have their trustworthiness to execute the
   authorities vested in them become suspect, the commander may temporarily or permanently
   prohibit the member from wearing the SP/SF shield and beret. Grounds for removal of the
   SP/SF shield and beret include violations of the Security Forces Code of Conduct. This
   action is not punishment but is associated with administrative, non-judicial or judicial action.
   NOTE: For DAF CP/SG issues, refer to civilian personnel office.
       3.2.4.1. To permanently remove an Airman’s AF Specialty Code (AFSC), commanders
       should refer to AFI 36-2626, Airman Retraining Program.
3.3. Force Protection Occupational Badge. The DFC may authorize persons in their
command to wear the force protection occupational badge. AF/A7S may authorize appropriate
persons to wear the badge. Award the badge to military personnel who acquire certain skill levels
and demonstrate honorable service in the SF career field.
   3.3.1. Allied nation, other US service and other USAF personnel performing instructor or
   liaison duty with a USAF SF organization wear the qualification badge commensurate with
   time requirements listed in AFI 36-2903.
   3.3.2. Airmen assigned to the AFRC or ANG are eligible for award of the qualification
   badge.
   3.3.3. Once approved, present the badge at an appropriate ceremony.
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                       11


   3.3.4. The DFC may rescind the badge should the bearer lose their Security Forces AFSC for
   misconduct.
3.4. Security Forces Equipment. Authorized SF equipment is contained in the approved SF
Equipment List maintained on the HQ AFSFC website. HQ AFSFC/SFX identifies and evaluates
commercially available and government-developed equipment necessary to support Service-wide
needs for SF personnel. SFXR conducts a semi-annual USAF SF Equipment Weapons
Configuration Board (EWCB) to update equipment listings, provide a forum to work SF-related
equipment problems and work logistics detail issues with MAJCOM Security Forces staff
representatives.
   3.4.1. HQ AFSFC manages, monitors or provides approval authority, as appropriate, for the
   following Allowance Source Code (ASC) dealing with SF equipment:
      3.4.1.1. ASC 001 -- Master Equipment Management Index.
      3.4.1.2. ASC 002 -- Monthly Allowance Notice (Update).
      3.4.1.3. ASC 009 -- Small Computers and Equipment.
      3.4.1.4. ASC 010 -- Registered Vehicles, ASC 012 -- Leased Vehicles.
      3.4.1.5. ASC 016 -- Clothing.
      3.4.1.6. ASC 538 -- Security Forces Equipment (General) and Weapons.
      3.4.1.7. ASC 629 -- Audio Visual.
      3.4.1.8. ASC 660 -- Communications Equipment.
3.5. Military Standardized Uniforms and Equipment. The approved standardized SF daily
use (non-LOGDET) equipment listing is found on the HQ AFSFC SMARTNet website.
   3.5.1. Security Forces personnel are required to utilize only approved and standardized duty
   equipment. Procurement and use of private commercial duty gear, which does not constitute
   a weapon or a non-lethal weapon, is authorized, as long as it is not covered by AF/A7S
   mandatory use policies. Local policy may dictate specific configuration of required
   equipment.
      3.5.1.1. When armed with the standard M9 handgun, only an approved standardized
      holster may be utilized. Shoulder holsters are not authorized for Security Forces
      personnel in uniform unless an exception is made in writing by the DFC. This exception
      is normally for personnel who have a medical waiver or who for other legitimate reasons
      cannot wear the standard holster. If the DFC has approved this exception in writing, these
      personnel will wear the authorized holsters listed by the AFSFC in the AF Small Arms
      and Light Weapons Accessories List. All personnel subject to this exception will
      complete required training IAW AFI 36-2646, Security Forces Training and
      Standardization Evaluation Programs. Standardized handcuffs with case (with the key
      readily available), radio with case, flashlight, ammo pouch, non-lethal weapon and first
      aid kit will also be worn with the M9 handgun arming configuration. The DFC will
      approve, in compliance with the AFSFC SF standardized daily equipment listing, any
      additional equipment configuration. (T-1)
 12                                                                AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


      3.5.1.2. When armed with an M-4/M-16 series rifle, the Defensor Fortis Load Carrying
      System (DF-LCS), handcuffs with case (with the key readily available), radio with case,
      non-lethal weapon and flashlight will be worn at a minimum. The DFC will approve, in
      compliance with the AFSFC SF standardized daily equipment listing, any additional
      equipment configuration. (T-1)
   3.5.2. Uniform and equipment wear will be consistent for all Security Forces personnel as
   required by the type of weapon(s) the member carries.
   3.5.3. MAJCOM/A7S and installation DFC will specify any additional equipment
   requirements.
   3.5.4. Mourning Bands. Mourning bands may be worn at the discretion of the DFC.
3.6. Land Mobile Radio (LMR) Systems. The LMR system is the primary means of
communication used to control SF operations. MAJCOMs determine requirements for "secure
voice" equipment (refer to AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense, for further information).
   3.6.1. SF use standard practices to ensure the radio net operates smoothly during normal and
   emergency situations. Do not use slang language; reference Attachment 4 of this publication
   for SF responses and brevity codes. Military radio transmissions must comply with Federal
   Communications Commission (FCC) regulations. The Allied Communication Publication
   (ACP) 125 (F), prescribes procedures for SF using two-way radios. (T-0)
   3.6.2. Net Control Station. When three or more two-way radios use a single radio net
   (frequency), establish a net control station according to the local installation communications
   officer's direction.
   3.6.3. Commanders ensure a positive Communications Security (COMSEC) program exists
   for radio communications when they:
      3.6.3.1. Use standard response codes to identify the urgency of each radio dispatch. (See
      Attachment 4).
      3.6.3.2. Devise local duress or signal codes to indicate an emergency or duress situation
      when they do not wish to alert any unauthorized listeners.
      3.6.3.3. Decode data encryption system equipped radios before servicing.
      3.6.3.4. Decode vehicle radios before releasing the vehicle to any maintenance activity.
   3.6.4. Consider equipping the Base Defense Operation Center/ Emergency Control Center
   (BDOC/ECC) with a two-way radio capable of communicating on the local civilian police
   emergency frequency. If a two-way radio is not available or practical, use a mutually agreed
   upon system that facilitates rapid emergency notification to civilian police like E-911.
   Negotiate for and fund such equipment at the installation level. Set up operating instructions
   according to local civilian police regulations.
   3.6.5. Personnel utilizing the E-911 system must be trained IAW Federal and state laws. (T-
   0)
3.7. Telephone Systems. Commercial and tactical telephone systems augment the LMR.
Connect all fixed SF posts to BDOC by dial or direct telephone lines.
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                          13


3.8. Vehicle Equipment. Table of Allowances (ToAs) and technical orders (TOs) establish
authorized equipment. The servicing Vehicle Management activity must be consulted prior to the
installation of “add-on” equipment. See AFI 24-302, Vehicle Management, for more information.
As a minimum, equipment permanently assigned to non-tactical vehicles will include the
following: (T-2)
   3.8.1. Warning Light System. Use a warning light system in the form of a magnetic or
   permanent mount-type single or multiple flashers, rotating or strobe light system. Mount the
   system either on the vehicle roof, on a "roof bar," on the dashboard and rear window
   platform or on the front bumper and the rear window platform. Do not mount lights inside
   the vehicle front grill. NOTE: Vehicles assigned/used by SF investigations may use covert
   emergency warning lights that may require the placement behind the front grill.
   3.8.2. Siren System. Mount the siren in concert with a roof-mounted warning light system or
   under the vehicle hood.
   3.8.3. Public Address System. Use either a portable system ("bullhorn") or a permanent
   system. Mount the permanent system in concert with a roof-mounted warning light bar
   system or under the vehicle's hood.
   3.8.4. Spotlight. Use either a portable spotlight (battery-operated or cigarette lighter plug-in
   type) or a permanently mounted spotlight. If a permanent-mount type is used, mount the
   spotlight on the vehicle roof, "roof bar" or on the driver's side door frame pillar.
   3.8.5. Land Mobile Radio. Use a permanently mounted multi-channel mobile or portable
   hand-held radio. Install radios so the driver has easy access and does not interfere with safe
   vehicle operation.
   3.8.6. A general purpose first aid kit (NSN 6545-00-922-1200 or equivalent).
   3.8.7. Extinguisher. A 2 1/2 pound ABC rated dry chemical fire extinguisher.
   3.8.8. Bloodborne Pathogen Protective Kit (required in all SF vehicles). Contents must
   include one-way respiratory cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) mask, surgical gloves,
   eye protective goggles or glasses with side shields, surgical mask and surgical gown. The
   DFC and installation medical officer determine other contents of the kit, for example, spit
   hoods as discussed in AFMAN 31-222, Air Force Use of Force Manual. Train those
   personnel determined to have occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens about how to
   use kit contents. Attachment 5 contains the requirements for a Bloodborne Pathogen
   Exposure Control Plan. (T-0)
   3.8.9. Remove unit level equipment before turning in vehicle for maintenance. NOTE:
   Exceptions may include posting/investigation vehicles.
3.9. Security Forces Vehicle Identification Markings. Refer to T.O. 36-1-191 for guidance
on marking SF vehicles. The servicing Vehicle Management activity must be consulted prior to
the installation of any vehicle decals or markings. (T-2)
3.10. Vehicle and Vehicle Equipment Care. Before each tour of duty, inspect vehicles and
vehicle equipment for safety and maintenance deficiencies. Test all warning lights, sirens, public
address systems, spotlights, etc. Report deficiencies to the on-duty flight chief/commander.
Annotate all discrepancies and deficiencies specific to the vehicle on the AF Form 1800,
Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report, assigned to that vehicle. If the deficiency is a
 14                                                                  AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


safety issue, do not operate the vehicle until the deficiency is repaired or corrected. Vehicles
should always present a clean appearance, weather permitting. Further information on SF vehicle
operation can be found in Attachment 6.
   3.10.1. Speedometer Validation. Validate the speedometer of all traffic patrol vehicles IAW
   local laws, if applicable. Patrol vehicle validation is only required if vehicles are used in lieu
   of a RADAR. The process to document vehicle speed can be performed by SF units
   validating speedometer accuracy using stationary radar. All radar units require calibration at
   designated intervals to ensure accuracy. True vehicle speed will be documented in 5-mph
   increments up to the maximum speed safe for the installation, but not to exceed 60 mph. Post
   results in each affected vehicle. If vehicle speedometer readings do not meet standards (+/- 5
   mph) or a malfunction is suspected, contact the servicing Vehicle Management Office for
   assistance. (T-0)
3.11. Vehicle-Mounted Video Surveillance Systems. Units may use vehicle-mounted video
surveillance systems as a tool to enhance their law enforcement and public safety role. Carefully
evaluate the cost and the need before buying video systems. The following guidelines apply:
   3.11.1. MAJCOM SFs approve unit requests for video systems.
       3.11.1.1. Installation Staff Judge Advocates (SJA) must coordinate in writing on the use,
       presentation, securing and disposition of recorded data. However, as a minimum, the
       vehicle-mounted video system will only be used when actively engaged in patrol
       activities (which includes traffic stops or any contact with a person, not on traffic
       accidents) and cannot be in use when the vehicle is parked and unattended in a non-
       enforcement function. Recorded data must be processed, maintained and documented in
       accordance with paragraph 8.2., Preserving Evidence. (T-1)
       3.11.1.2. Vehicle-mounted video surveillance system recorded data must be
       stored/housed in a locked, tamper proof container with access only by the on duty flight
       chief/commander. (T-1)
   3.11.2. There is no centrally managed procurement program for video systems. Units must
   determine needs locally and procure the appropriate system that best meets their needs.
   Research the state and local requirements for possible restrictions prior to procurement of
   any system. Additionally, consider sustainment and maintenance cost for the life cycle of the
   system.
   3.11.3. Follow standard supply acquisition procedures.
3.12. Tactical Ballistic Protection System. Each Security Forces member will be equipped
with body armor. Security Forces conducting L&O operations must have lightweight body armor
with minimum threat level II or higher. Other protective clothing and equipment may be issued
when approved by the Installation/Activity Commander. (T-1)
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                          15


                                           Chapter 4

                             SECURITY FORCES ACTIVITIES

4.1. Duty Expectations. Security Forces provide the foundation of the Integrated Defense (ID)
concept.
   4.1.1. Reporting for Duty. All personnel must report for duty fit and prepared to assume their
   assigned post. Each of the following paragraphs addresses areas of concern for members
   reporting for duty.
   4.1.2. Physical and Mental Fitness for Duty. Security Forces and augmentee personnel must
   be capable of performing physically demanding tasks under often harsh, unforgiving,
   unpredictable and sometimes life-threatening conditions. Maintaining proper fitness is
   essential to mission accomplishment and the survivability of our Defenders. It is each
   individual’s responsibility to maintain appropriate levels of physical conditioning and
   adherence to USAF fitness standards.
       4.1.2.1. In addition to physical fitness, personnel must adhere to the following:
          4.1.2.1.1. Be mentally alert.
          4.1.2.1.2. Abstain from consumption of alcoholic beverages within 8 hours of duty or
          an additional amount of time if the alcohol influences the member’s capability to
          perform their duties.
          4.1.2.1.3. Inform supervisor of prescription and non-prescription drugs that might
          impair duty performance.
          4.1.2.1.4. Inform supervisor of any mental distractions caused by unusual stress or
          crisis.
   4.1.3. Maintain Proper Qualifications for Assigned Post. Supervisors and their members
   must ensure individuals possess all qualifications and certifications to perform duties in their
   assigned post. Examples include: vehicle and weapon qualifications and required duty-
   position certifications for specific duty posts. (T-1)
   4.1.4. Arming and Equipping Security Forces. Arming and equipping of Security Forces
   personnel will be IAW AFI 31-117 and AFI 31-101, MAJCOM requirements and as required
   by the Integrated Defense Council (IDC). DFCs will ensure all armed SF members carry at
   least one AF approved Non-lethal Weapon (NLW) capability regardless of mission. (T-1)
   4.1.5. Duty Schedule. The DFC determines unit flight schedules based upon unit needs.
   Consider the following basic requirements when developing flight schedules:
       4.1.5.1. The standard flight schedule is the 8-hour shift schedule. However, due to high
       deployment rates/ contingencies, Security Forces may be required to work 12-hour shifts
       for short periods of time at the discretion of the DFC.
       4.1.5.2. Flight schedules should provide periods for the completion of proficiency and
       recurring training requirements.
       4.1.5.3. Flight schedules should provide a schedule to allow members uninterrupted
       sleep (7-9 hours) while off-duty to prepare for their next shift.
 16                                                                  AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


       4.1.5.4. Irrespective of the type of flight scheduling used, it is important that posts and
       patrols be staffed according to the post priority chart. On-duty time and time off should
       be commensurate with effective employment of Security Forces personnel.
       4.1.5.5. Scheduling. Post the flight duty roster in a prominent place, but consistent with
       sound Operations Security (OPSEC) practices. The duty roster should show the schedule
       and post for at least the next duty day. This advance notice gives each person the
       opportunity to ensure they report for duty in the correct uniform.
4.2. Security Forces Guardmount. Guardmount is an official military function conducted at
the start of the SF shift. Guardmount may be used to conduct roll call, announcements, weapons
and equipment inspections and post assignments. It may also be used to determine the readiness
of personnel, to include their appearance, as well as mental and physical condition. Conduct
open ranks inspections at least once per work cycle IAW AFMAN 36-2203, Drill and
Ceremonies, and annotate it in the AF Form 53, Security Forces Desk Blotter. Guardmount is
also an appropriate opportunity for recognition of deserving personnel. Ultimately, SF
commanders will determine the standardization of Guardmount for their unit (i.e., weapons and
equipment inspections may be conducted prior to Guardmount). Additionally, the following
items should be briefed during Guardmount:
   4.2.1. Brief weapons safety, ground safety, K9 safety, vehicle safety, exercise safety, current
   Force Protection Condition (FPCON), sign/countersign, duress words and current Be On the
   Look Out (BOLO) bulletins.
4.3. Post Visits. Post visits are a means for Senior Wing/Base Leaders, First Sergeants,
Chaplains, etc., to inspect facilities, take questions, ascertain the welfare of personnel and build
morale. Post visits should be conducted during both day and night hours and be documented in
the AF Form 53.
4.4. Post Checks. Unit leadership and on-duty supervisory personnel will conduct post checks
to ensure posted personnel remain alert and are knowledgeable of assigned duties and
responsibilities. Post checks also include inspection of SF facilities and vehicles, as well as
individual and post-related equipment. Post checks must be documented in the AF Form 53. (T-
2)
4.5. Security Forces Duty Officer Program. The DFC will establish an SF duty officer
program. SF SNCOs and officers will be appointed to perform post checks, observe exercises,
inspect equipment/facilities and provide feedback, in writing, to the commander on unit
readiness and areas of concern. The SF duty officer program does not relieve the DFC and SFM
from conducting, at a minimum, a monthly post check on all flights and S-functions while on
duty. (T-3)
4.6. Post Reporting. SF members report the status of their post to the senior person conducting
the post check or visit. Additionally, SF member will use Attachment 7 as a template for a
standardized Post Briefing. The DFC will determine if any additional personnel will be added to
their local post reporting. (T-3)
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                            17


                                            Chapter 5

                                       JURISDICTIONS

5.1. Jurisdiction. Jurisdiction is the authority, capacity, power or right to apply the law. This
authority involves the right to charge a person with an offense, try them in a court and make a
final determination of their case through courts of appeal. SF personnel must be knowledgeable
about the type of jurisdiction in their operating environment and use the SJA as the focal point
for determining SF jurisdiction.
   5.1.1. Security Forces are representatives of the US Government, the US Armed Forces, the
   installation commander and the DFC. The Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM), Rules for
   Courts-Martial (RCM), Rule 302(b) (1), and UCMJ, Article 7(b), give SF the authority to
   apprehend individuals. Carry out this important duty in a fair, impartial and firm manner.
   5.1.2. Noncommissioned officers and on-duty SF or SF Augmentation Duty personnel
   performing investigative, law and order or security duties have the authority to administer
   oaths to suspects, subjects, witnesses and victims, as required. For further information, refer
   to UCMJ, Article 136 (b)(4) & (b)(6).
   5.1.3. Jurisdiction can generally be described as the power of a court. These criteria include:
       5.1.3.1. Subject matter jurisdiction. This is the jurisdiction of the court over the offense.
       For example, a magistrate court would not have subject matter jurisdiction over an
       offense of insubordination because it is not an offense prohibited by the federal criminal
       code or any state or local code that can be assimilated. A court-martial, by contrast,
       would have subject matter jurisdiction over this offense; as such, conduct is prohibited by
       the UCMJ.
       5.1.3.2. Personal jurisdiction. This is the jurisdiction of the court over the offender or the
       accused. The personal jurisdiction of a court-martial is status-based. If a person is subject
       to the UCMJ at the time of the offense and at the time of trial, a court-martial would have
       personal jurisdiction over the accused.
       5.1.3.3. Legislative jurisdiction. Legislative jurisdiction determines the limits of the
       power of the court with regard to the physical location of a crime or event. In some
       criminal cases, there may be a question concerning what level of government or
       sovereign (state, federal [including military]), or Host Nation (HN) has authority over
       specific personnel or violations. At times, concurrent jurisdiction may be in effect,
       meaning that multiple governmental authorities may have jurisdiction or exclusive
       jurisdiction by one governmental authority. The UCMJ is extra-territorial, meaning that it
       is applicable worldwide to those subject to the UCMJ, Article 2. L&O personnel should
       consult their servicing SJA concerning jurisdictional matters.
       5.1.3.4. Legislative Jurisdiction Types. The types of legislative jurisdiction that apply to
       military installations and facilities are:
           5.1.3.4.1. Exclusive Jurisdiction. As the term implies, this type of legislative
           jurisdiction gives the federal government sole authority to legislate. The federal
           government has total or complete jurisdiction of offenses occurring on federal lands.
           Exclusive jurisdiction gives the federal government the exclusive right to prosecute
 18                                                                  AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


           offenses occurring therein. If persons commit an offense under the UCMJ, they are
           tried solely by the military, unless the crime also violates some other federal statute.
           Generally, the federal government will dispose of all cases involving military
           personnel for offenses committed in areas of federal exclusive jurisdiction. Civilians
           who commit offenses in areas of federal exclusive jurisdiction can be prosecuted
           and/or turned over to civilian federal authorities for disposition of offenses.
           5.1.3.4.2. Concurrent Jurisdiction. Both the federal and state governments retain all
           their legislative authority. If there is a potential conflict regarding exercise of
           jurisdiction, the federal government prevails under the Supremacy Clause listed in
           Article VI of the US Constitution. SF should consult their SJA for additional
           guidance.
           5.1.3.4.3. Proprietary Jurisdiction. The military exercises the rights of a property
           owner only. The only federal laws that apply are those that do not rely upon federal
           jurisdiction, e.g., espionage, bank robbery, tax fraud, counterfeiting, etc. However,
           the installation commander can still exclude civilians from the area pursuant to the
           commander’s inherent authority.
           5.1.3.4.4. Partial Jurisdiction. Both the federal and state governments have some
           authority, but neither has exclusive power. For example, a state may have retained
           criminal jurisdiction over an installation or part of an installation (housing areas, for
           example).
   5.1.4. Martial Law. The term "martial law" means "the temporary military government of a
   civilian population." Declaring US federal martial law might require the US to exercise
   jurisdiction over the civilian population. In time of an emergency, military jurisdiction over
   the civilian population extends beyond the restoration of law and order. It provides relief and
   rehabilitation of the people, the resumption of industrial production, the re-establishment of
   the economy and the protection of life and property.
5.2. Jurisdiction Sources. There are three sources of military jurisdiction.
   5.2.1. US Constitution. The US Constitution established a system of fundamental laws and
   principles that prescribe the nature, function and limits of our government. Simply said, SF
   powers are constitutionally founded. The specific provisions of the Constitution relating to
   military jurisdiction are found in the powers granted to Congress, in the authority vested in
   the President and in a provision of the Fifth Amendment. This jurisdiction is designed to
   operate outside of the federal court system. The efficient operation of military law requires a
   separate judicial system geared to the needs of the military.
       5.2.1.1. Article 1, Section 8, authorizes the US Congress to make rules for the
       government and regulation of the land and naval armed forces. Under this authority, the
       US Congress enacted the Articles of War and the Articles for the Government of the
       Navy. The UCMJ was later written for all branches of the US Armed Forces and replaced
       the early Articles.
       5.2.1.2. Article 2, Section 2, provides for the President of the United States (POTUS) to
       be Commander-in-Chief of the US Armed Forces. Under this authority, the POTUS
       issues executive orders affecting the US Armed Forces. The UCMJ, Article 36, further
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                          19


       states the POTUS can prescribe RCM procedure. By virtue of his/her authority under the
       Constitution and the UCMJ, the POTUS, by Executive Order, has prescribed the MCM.
   5.2.2. Federal Statutes. The second source of jurisdiction is US federal statutes – laws passed
   by the US Congress. Most of the statutes that directly affect the USAF are compiled in 10
   U.S.C.
   5.2.3. International Law. The third source of jurisdiction is international law. Military
   jurisdiction derived from international law is difficult to precisely define. However, civilized
   nations have observed certain rules in their relationships with each other.
       5.2.3.1. The sources of international law are customs, written agreements among nations
       and the writings of authorities. The Law of Armed Conflict (LoAC) is also included
       under international law (e.g., citizens of a foreign nation may be tried by military courts-
       martial or commission for certain offenses during wartime).
       5.2.3.2. The LoAC is derived from agreements between nations in such international
       gatherings as The Hague and Geneva Conventions. These conventions spell out the
       conduct of participants in warfare. The purpose of the law is to restore order and to
       protect both combatants and noncombatants from unnecessary suffering. It defines the
       rights of prisoners-of-war, the sick and injured, and civilians in occupied territories.
5.3. Jurisdiction Application. Jurisdiction applies to persons, places and offenses.
   5.3.1. Person. Article 2 of the UCMJ states exactly who is subject to military jurisdiction.
   Those personnel subject to military jurisdiction with which SF personnel are likely to come
   into contact include:
       5.3.1.1. Members of the regular component of the Armed Forces.
       5.3.1.2. Cadets, aviation cadets and midshipmen.
       5.3.1.3. Members of the reserve components while on inactive training, but in the case of
       the Army National Guard or the ANG, only when in federal service.
       5.3.1.4. Retired, regular component members of the military entitled to pay.
       5.3.1.5. Retired, reserve component members receiving military hospitalization.
       5.3.1.6. Members of the fleet reserve and the fleet marine reserve.
       5.3.1.7. Persons in Armed Forces custody serving a sentence imposed by a court-martial.
       5.3.1.8. Prisoners of war in custody of the Armed Forces.
       5.3.1.9. In time of declared war or contingency operation, persons with or accompanying
       the Armed Forces in the field. However, this is only in time of war or contingency
       operation and subject to certain limitations.
       5.3.1.10. Members of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Public
       Health Service and other organizations, when assigned to and serving with the armed
       forces.
       5.3.1.11. Subject to any treaty or agreement which the US is or may be a party to, or to
       any accepted rule of international law, persons serving with, employed by or
 20                                                                  AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


       accompanying the Armed Forces Outside the United States (OCONUS) and the
       Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Northern Marianas Islands and the Virgin Islands.
       5.3.1.12. Subject to any treaty or agreement which the US is or may be a party to, or to
       any accepted rule of international law, persons within an area leased by otherwise
       reserved or acquired for use of the US which is under the control of the Secretary
       concerned and which is OCONUS and outside the Canal Zone, the Commonwealth of
       Puerto Rico, Guam and the Virgin Islands.
   5.3.2. Place. Article 5 of the UCMJ states that the Code applies in all places and there is no
   restriction on where the case may be heard. The military has jurisdiction to prosecute any
   offense committed on or off base.
   5.3.3. Offenses. The last element is that the offense be subject to the jurisdiction of courts-
   martial. However, in determining whether subject-matter jurisdiction exists, it is necessary to
   look at the service member's status at the time the offense is committed. If the service
   member is lacking a military status at the time of the offense, there is no jurisdiction over that
   offense, regardless of whether the offense violates any UCMJ article.
5.4. Security Forces Authority. MCM Rule 302 and UCMJ Article 7(b) grants SF the
authority to apprehend any person subject to trial by courts-martial upon probable cause if the SF
member is executing security/law enforcement duties. SF has four authorities: to detain,
apprehend, report and correct.
   5.4.1. Detain. Detaining or detention is a term used for dealing with civilians or other
   personnel not subject to Article 2 of the UCMJ.
   5.4.2. Apprehend. Apprehension is the equivalent of “arrest” in civilian terminology. It
   means taking a person into custody. The same rules apply to detentions and apprehensions.
   For example, if a person on base wearing civilian clothes violates the UCMJ, and/or federal
   and state laws, detain and verify their status. If the detainee is a military member, and it is
   appropriate, apprehend.
   5.4.3. Report. SF members’ responsibility to report includes a requirement to prepare or
   present an official detailed account of violations of the UCMJ to the proper authorities.
   5.4.4. Correct. SF have the authority to correct, caution or warn offenders for minor
   infractions of laws and regulations. However, SF does not have authority to punish an
   offender, so they must use caution that their action does not constitute an admonition or
   reprimand.
   5.4.5. Federal Law. SF also has the authority to enforce other aspects of federal law not
   covered by the UCMJ.
       5.4.5.1. The Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act authorizes prosecution of certain
       criminal offenses committed by certain members of the armed forces and by persons
       employed by or accompanying the armed forces outside the United States. Under the
       Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, offenses punishable by confinement of more
       than 1 year if committed in the United States, are applicable to personnel who engage in
       the same conduct outside the United States. These individuals are subject to trial by the
       federal government if the crime is a felony, the HN fails to prosecute and the US attorney
       believes prosecution is warranted (see 18 U.S.C. § 3261, 3262, 3263, 3264, 3265, 3266
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                        21


     and 3267). Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5525.11, Criminal Jurisdiction
     Over Civilians Employed by or Accompanying the Armed Forces Outside the United
     States, Certain Service Members and Former Service Members, provides implementing
     procedures for the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act.
     5.4.5.2. The Internal Security Act of 1950. 50 U.S.C. §797 (Section 21 of the Internal
     Security Act of 1950) authorizes the Secretary of Defense to designate military
     commanders to promulgate orders and regulations to protect property and places under
     their command. DoDI 5200.08, Security of DoD Installations and Resources and the
     DoD Physical Security Review Board (PSRB), designates military commanders of the AF
     and other branches as having the authority to issue orders and regulations pursuant to the
     Act. Additionally, the Act makes it a misdemeanor to violate any order or regulation
     issued pursuant to the Act. The act applies to both military members and civilians.
     5.4.5.3. Assimilative Crimes Act. The Federal Assimilated Crimes Act allows for
     adoption of state law in the absence of applicable federal law, e.g., many traffic offenses.
     This Act is not limited to traffic offenses. The Federal Assimilative Crimes Act (18
     U.S.C. § 13) is an adoption by Congress of state criminal laws for areas of exclusive or
     concurrent federal jurisdiction, provided federal criminal law, including the UCMJ, has
     not defined an applicable offense for the misconduct committed. The Act applies to state
     laws validly existing at the time of the offense without regard to when these laws were
     enacted, whether before or after passage of the Act and whether before or after the
     acquisition of the land where the offense was committed. AFI 31-218(I), Motor Vehicle
     Traffic Supervision, has further information on the assimilation of traffic laws. The rules
     for execution of investigative jurisdiction between AFOSI and SF still apply.
     5.4.5.4. Posse Comitatus Act. The Congress of the US enacted this law in 1878 to restrict
     the use of the Army to enforce civilian law (18, U.S.C. § 1385). See also 10 U.S.C. §
     375.
        5.4.5.4.1. This Act prevents Army and Air Force personnel from executing the laws
        of the states or the laws of the US except when acting under the authority of the US
        Constitution, an Act of Congress or under the direction of the POTUS. Posse
        Comitatus governs the use of Army and Air Force personnel only within the
        Continental United States (CONUS). The Navy and Marine Corps follow the Act by
        DoD policy. The Act does not apply to ANG performing in Title 32 status under the
        command of a State governor.
        5.4.5.4.2. The Posse Comitatus Act does not prevent:
            5.4.5.4.2.1. Military authorities from taking action on incidents involving
            civilians when such action involves a specific military purpose.
            5.4.5.4.2.2. A military member acting in an unofficial capacity to make a citizen's
            arrest or to take other action to preserve the public peace.
            5.4.5.4.2.3. SF from using force to stop a fleeing felon or suspected felon for the
            purpose of aiding civilian law enforcement.
            5.4.5.4.2.4. Actions in the performance of duties employed off-duty as a security
            guard or police officer (i.e., SF members with second jobs).
 22                                                                   AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


       5.4.5.5. 18 U.S.C. § 1382. Prohibits individuals from entering military installations
       within the jurisdiction of the United States for a purpose prohibited by law or lawful
       regulation or reentering an installation after being ordered not to reenter by any officer in
       command of the installation.
5.5. Probable Cause/Reasonable Belief. Probable cause to apprehend exists when there is a
reasonable belief that an offense has been or is being committed and the person to be
apprehended committed or is committing it. Reasonable belief means that there is reliable
information that a reasonable, prudent person would rely on, which makes it more likely than not
that something is true. Reasonable beliefs are also a logical and rational evaluation of the
circumstances of an offense and of the suspect’s connection with the offense. Apprehend or
detain any suspect, military or civilian, whom there is probable cause to believe has committed a
violation of the UCMJ (Military) or U.S.C. (Civilian) equivalent. A Probable Cause statement
may be captured on the AF Form 1176, Authority to Search and Seize, or on bond paper and
attached to report. SF members can establish reasonable belief through one of the following:
   5.5.1. The SF member actually sees the person commit the crime.
   5.5.2. The SF member gets the description of a person or vehicle from another SF member.
   For example, if the SF controller directs that a particular person be apprehended or detained
   for assault on another person, the SF member now has reasonable belief.
   5.5.3. The SF member receives a statement by a reliable person. SF members must use their
   judgment and/or past experience to determine the validity of this information. Be sure of
   sources before action is taken.
   5.5.4. A superior in the SF member’s CoC orders an apprehension. Remember, all NCOs
   and commissioned officers have the authority to apprehend anyone violating any section of
   the UCMJ.
   5.5.5. Complainant or victim identifies the alleged perpetrator.
5.6. Deputization of Air Force Law Enforcement Personnel by State and Local
Governments. The Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) is the approval authority for the
deputization by state and local governments of uniformed law enforcement personnel under the
authority of the USAF, including SF, DAF CP/SG and contract guards.
   5.6.1. If state or local deputization is needed, the senior installation law enforcement official
   will prepare the request. The request will be based upon the justification guidelines
   established in DoDI 5525.13, Limitation of Authority to Deputize DoD Uniformed Law
   Enforcement Personnel by State and Local Governments, and will include (T-0):
       5.6.1.1. The number of uniformed law enforcement personnel to be granted the authority
       and a certification that they have received the requisite training to affect the type of
       deputization.
       5.6.1.2. The time frame envisioned for the authority to be exercised. Blanket time
       authorizations will not be considered.
       5.6.1.3. The policies and procedures to prevent misuse of the authority to be employed
       by the requesting installation law enforcement official.
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                          23


       5.6.1.4. A copy of the proposed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the state or
       local jurisdiction that will carry out the deputization, to include the signature of the
       appropriate official representing that state or local jurisdiction.
   5.6.2. Requests for approval will follow the appropriate CoC to the SECAF for approval. As
   a minimum, requests will be coordinated through the following:
       5.6.2.1. Installation Commander
       5.6.2.2. MAJCOM/A7S
       5.6.2.3. HQ AFSFC
       5.6.2.4. AF/A7S
       5.6.2.5. AF/JA
       5.6.2.6. SAF/GC
       5.6.2.7. SAF/IG
   5.6.3. The SECAF will consider the request and return a decision through appropriate
   channels.
5.7. Off-duty employment as civilian police officers. Off-duty SF enlisted members may
serve as members of a civilian police agency, either as a regular or reserve duty police officer,
provided such service is in their personal capabilities, does not require the exercise of military
authority and does not interfere with their military duties. Subject to the same restrictions,
commissioned officers may engage in off-duty employment, provided they do not violate the
civil office restriction found in 10 U.S.C. § 973. The restriction provides that regular, guard and
reserve commissioned officers or retired officers called to active duty for more than 270 days,
may not accept off-duty employment as a federal, state or local civilian law enforcement official
in any position which qualifies as a “civil office.” Guidance on what constitutes a civil office
within the meaning of 10 U.S.C. § 973 is contained in AFI 51-902, Political Activities by
Members of the US Air Force. All off-duty employment of SF personnel (officer and enlisted) is
subject to approval of their commander and must be coordinated with the SJA. (T-3)
5.8. Support to the US Secret Service (USSS) and US Department of State (DoS). Refer
requests for assistance from other federal agencies to Air Force Office of Special Investigations
(AFOSI). When appropriately tasked to assist, SF will support the USSS in the protection of the
President and Vice President of the United States, major political candidates and visiting foreign
heads of state. When assigned to such duty, Security Forces are subject to the overall supervision
of the Director, USSS, or Director of Diplomatic Security, as appropriate. If working under the
support of AFOSI for protective services, SF will work under the supervision of the AFOSI
Protective Detail Leader. Reference DoDI 3025.19, Procedures for Sharing Information with
and Providing Support to the US Secret Service (USSS), Department of Homeland Security
(DHS), for additional details.(T-0)
 24                                                                AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


                                          Chapter 6

                    APPREHENSION, DETENTION AND CUSTODY

6.1. Apprehension Considerations. Immediately upon apprehending a suspect, handcuff and
conduct a search of the suspect and the area under their immediate control for weapons and any
evidence the suspect could remove or destroy. This emphasizes the safety of SF members and the
apprehended individual. During incidents in which a subject is detained but not under
apprehension, if there is reasonable suspicion to believe the subject may possess a weapon, as a
minimum, conduct a protective frisk for weapons.
   6.1.1. When to Apprehend: Apprehensions are based upon probable cause, which means
   there are reasonable grounds to believe that an offense has been or is being committed and
   the person to be apprehended committed or is committing it. If the facts and circumstances
   reasonably indicate a person committed or is committing an offense, then apprehension is
   justified.
       6.1.1.1. By Observation. SF member observes the actual offense. Disorderly conduct and
       traffic violations are common examples. Planned offenses usually are not committed
       while SF are in the area. When SF members observe an offense that requires
       apprehension, they must act immediately.
       6.1.1.2. By Report. Many complaints are received at the BDOC by telephone or in
       person. A patrol may be dispatched to investigate and make necessary apprehensions or
       the complaint may be referred to SF Investigations (S2I), depending upon the need for
       immediate action.
   6.1.2. Approach. Two factors responders need to keep in mind when approaching a suspect
   to affect an apprehension are position and attitude.
       6.1.2.1. Position. When approaching a suspect, move toward the person from a direction
       most advantageous to the SF member. When addressing a suspect, the individual
       naturally tends to face the person speaking. If the SF member plans to question the person
       or check identification, ensure to maintain a proper reactionary gap. The assisting
       patrolman must take a position of advantage.
       6.1.2.2. Attitude. A smooth, courteous and efficient approach with a firm, but friendly,
       conversational tone may calm all but the most violent offenders.
   6.1.3. Evaluation. SF must evaluate the attitude and physical condition of a suspect before
   deciding on a course of action.
       6.1.3.1. Attitude of Suspect. SF will maintain situational awareness and a reactionary gap
       even when a suspect has a cooperative attitude. Keep alert and be ready to employ
       counter measures in the event the situation becomes hostile.
       6.1.3.2. Physical Condition. SF will request medical attention for any injury sustained by
       a suspect. An apparent minor injury could be serious and immediate medical attention
       can prevent serious injury or death. (T-1)
6.2. Apprehension on Military Installations. On duty SF personnel performing official police
or guard duties have the authority to apprehend any person subject to the UCMJ, regardless of
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                           25


rank. SF personnel may apprehend any person subject to the UCMJ if they have probable
cause/reasonable belief to believe an offense has been or is being committed and the person
being apprehended committed or is committing the offense.
   6.2.1. The DFC, with the advice of the SJA, will establish local procedures for handling
   civilian offenders. (T-1)
       6.2.1.1. Civilians may be detained for offenses committed on a military installation.
       Since civilians are not normally subject to the UCMJ, refer civilian violators to a US
       Magistrate for judicial disposition or to the local civil authorities having jurisdiction.
       6.2.1.2. For minor offenses, release civilian offenders to their military sponsor. If they do
       not have a military sponsor, release them to a relative, friend or on their own
       recognizance.
   6.2.2. IAW AFI 51-201, Administration of Military Justice, the installation commander or
   appointed magistrate must authorize apprehensions of military personnel in on-base private
   dwellings. The rule applies if the subject is in the subject’s quarters or someone else’s.
   Obtain authorization to apprehend on an AF Form 3226, Authority to Apprehend in Private
   Dwelling. NOTE: This procedure is not required during emergencies to save a person’s life
   or prevent serious bodily harm (e.g., gunfire or screaming being heard from outside quarters).
   (T-0)
6.3. Off Installation Patrols.
   6.3.1. SF performing patrol duties off the installation have the authority to apprehend
   military personnel, subject to probable cause requirements and the rules governing
   apprehensions in a private dwelling. Off installation patrols must use civilian law
   enforcement officials to identify all suspected military violators in civilian clothing if
   possible. Develop policies and procedures for patrol activity conducted off the installation in
   consultation with local law enforcement officials and SJA. (T-0)
   6.3.2. OCONUS. The installation commander may authorize off installation patrols.
   Coordinate with the MAJCOM SJA before authorizing off installation patrols. SF maintains
   the authority to apprehend military personnel on or off the installation in an OCONUS
   environment in accordance with Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) or host nation
   agreements. The authority to detain civilians on a US military installation varies in each host
   nation. Bilateral agreements and directives must specify such limitations. (T-0)
6.4. Custody. Custody is the restraint of free movement. An apprehension occurs when an SF
member clearly notifies a suspect they are under apprehension. This notice should be given
orally or in writing, but it may be implied by the circumstances. Once apprehended and in
custody, the apprehending officer must control the movements of the offender. Protect the health
and welfare of all apprehended suspects.
6.5. Rights Advisement. Prior to asking questions related to the offense under investigation,
advise suspects of their right against self-incrimination IAW the UCMJ, Article 31, for active
duty military personnel. For civilian personnel, advise suspects of their right against self-
incrimination IAW the US Constitution, Fifth Amendment, if conducting a custodial
interrogation. Use the AFVA 31-231, Advisement of Rights, for verbal advisement (usually on-
scene), or the AF Form 1168, Statement of Suspect/Witness/Complainant, for written proof of
 26                                                                   AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


rights advisement (usually prior to taking a written statement). If possible provide the
Advisement of Rights in front of a witness. Questions concerning a suspect’s identity, address,
status, health, welfare or questions not related to the offense under investigation do not require a
rights advisement. For further guidance on rights advisement, see Chapter 10 of this instruction.
   6.5.1. Suspects on verified active orders (i.e., active ANG personnel while on Title
   10/federal orders, and AFRC personnel while serving in an active duty positions) will be
   advised of their rights IAW the UCMJ, Article 31. NOTE: Contact local SJA when duty
   status is in question.
   6.5.2. Spontaneous Utterances. Situations will arise when an individual contacted by SF
   personnel will voluntarily make an incriminating statement. A common example occurs
   when a suspect, upon initially being contacted and informed of the purpose of the contact,
   offers a voluntary statement prior to the administration of any rights advisement. Another
   example is the statement made by a suspect after being detained while being transported in a
   government vehicle. Spontaneous utterances are generally admissible in courts-martial. No
   follow-up questions to the utterance can be conducted until a proper rights advisement has
   been made.
6.6. Use of Force. Use of Force will be conducted IAW AFI 31-117 during apprehension and
detention of suspects. In overseas or deployed areas, comply with local SOFA and Rules of
Engagement (ROE) mandated by the installation commander. Always use the reasonable amount
of force necessary when placing a suspect under apprehension. Use NLWs and handcuffs only
when specifically trained in their use. Unit Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and Tactics,
Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) may require adjustments to enable employment of NLWs and
new equipment for the success of specific missions. In addition, SF must strictly adhere to
procedures outlined in AFMAN 31-222 when handcuffing, employing NLWs, searching or
transporting apprehended or detained personnel.
6.7. Disposition of Apprehended or Detained Persons Vehicle and/or Property. Installation
DFCs, in conjunction with the SJA, will develop comprehensive procedures to inventory
vehicles and/or property seized incident to an apprehension IAW AFI 31-218 (I). A complete
accountability will be conducted of the vehicle and/or property found in the vehicle to include
items contained within. Document in detail all property on an AF Form 52, Evidence Tag. For
evidence of the offense for which the subject was apprehended or contraband found during the
inventory, refer to Chapter 8 of this instruction. (T-1)
6.8. Disposition of Civilian Offenders and the US Magistrate Court. The installation
commander’s inherent authority to protect the installation permits SF, as agents of the
installation commander, the authority to detain civilians for offenses occurring on the
installation. SF personnel can detain civilians for a reasonable period of time sufficient to
investigate the incident before turning them over to an appropriate civilian law enforcement
authority IAW DoDI 5200.08; AFI 51-905, Use of Magistrate Judges for Trial of Misdemeanors
Committed by Civilians; 18 U.S.C. § 1382; and 50 U.S.C. § 797. CONUS installations with
exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction may hold offenders for a reasonable timeframe to issue
citations for the violation of misdemeanor offenses. DFCs will work with installation
commanders to have MOUs/memorandums of agreement (MOAs) with local law enforcement
(state, county and city) and/or other legal authorities to clearly define the role of SF in situations
regarding the enforcement of assimilated laws, the issuance of citations and the disposition of
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                               27


offenders. Additionally, DFCs will ensure the defined legal authorities, jurisdiction and role of
SF are articulated in local operating instructions. (T-1)
   6.8.1. The US Magistrate federal court system is a venue enabling the enforcement of
   misdemeanor laws on installations. US magistrates “shall have jurisdiction to try persons
   accused of, and sentence persons convicted of, misdemeanors” (18 U.S.C. § 3401[a]). The
   US Magistrate is a federal judge designated to try misdemeanors committed on federal
   property. The US Magistrate Court also has jurisdiction over juveniles who commit on-
   installation misdemeanors (18 U.S.C. § 3401[a]). Cases most frequently tried include
   larceny, assault and traffic offenses. Since the jurisdiction of the court is limited to the trial of
   misdemeanor cases, it may not impose a sentence of imprisonment in excess of 1 year. The
   US Magistrate will generally have jurisdiction for on-installation misdemeanors, committed
   by civilians and military. An attorney from the office of the SJA may prosecute a case as a
   special assistant US attorney. The US Magistrate has jurisdiction to try persons accused of,
   and sentence persons convicted of, misdemeanors. NOTE: For the purposes of this
   instruction, a “juvenile”' is a person who has not attained his or her eighteenth birthday
   unless the individual is an Active Duty Service member.
   6.8.2. Offenders are cited to appear in US Magistrate court by the issuance of a US district
   court violation notice. Some offenses allow payments by mail, while others require a court
   appearance. The trial of a juvenile may necessitate a certification by the US attorney (18
   U.S.C. § 5032). This certification will require coordination between the SJA and the
   appropriate civilian authorities.
   6.8.3. The prosecution of a criminal charge is determined by the court or courts with
   jurisdiction over the case. Types of prosecutors include:
       6.8.3.1. Military (trial counsel).
       6.8.3.2. State (district, state, prosecuting and circuit attorneys).
       6.8.3.3. Federal (attorney general, US attorney and special assistant US attorney).
       6.8.3.4. Host Nation (HN) (HN attorney, based upon the system and court structure of
       the HN).
   6.8.4. The four types of law enforcement (LE) include:
       6.8.4.1. State (city, county and state).
       6.8.4.2. Federal (Federal Bureau of Investigations [FBI]; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
       and Firearms [ATF]; US Marshals; and all other federal LE activities and agencies, to
       include Defense Criminal Investigative Organizations [DCIO], United States Army
       Criminal Investigation Division [USACID], AFOSI and Naval Criminal Investigative
       Service [NCIS]).
       6.8.4.3. Military Police (including Security Forces and Master-at-Arms).
       6.8.4.4. HN (LE organizations within the HN criminal justice system).
   6.8.5. When a crime occurs that is punishable by military and civilian courts, the supporting
   SJA must coordinate to determine where the accused will be tried. In many situations,
   memorandums of understanding with state or local authorities or SOFAs with HNs will
   outline who has primary jurisdiction in specific cases or circumstances. The US Magistrate
28                                                                 AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


  will generally have jurisdiction of on-installation misdemeanors committed on an installation
  with federal (exclusive or concurrent) jurisdiction. A US Magistrate does not have
  jurisdiction over offenses committed on an installation with proprietary jurisdiction.
  6.8.6. Juvenile Offenders. Disposition procedures of juvenile offenders:
     6.8.6.1. Contact and brief the SJA any time a juvenile is detained for a violation.
         6.8.6.2. For Minor Traffic Violations, process juveniles the same as adult offenders.
         6.8.6.3. When juveniles are involved in incidents violating the law (i.e., driving
         under the influence, vandalism, disorderly conduct, larceny, assault with injury, etc.)
         comply with the following procedures:
         6.8.6.4. Detention of juveniles. If necessary, conduct a search for evidence or
         weapons in the presence of the juvenile’s sponsor or an additional SF member.
         Transport the offender to BDOC if warranted. A minimum of two SF members will
         transport all juveniles. Preferably have at least one SF member of the same sex as the
         offender. Annotate starting and ending mileage in the AF Form 53. (T-3)
         6.8.6.5. SF will not interview juveniles until at least one parent or guardian is
         present. If the parent or guardian refuses or declines to be present, cannot respond in a
         timely manner or cannot be reached, an additional SF member or the sponsor’s First
         Sergeant will be present during the interview. (T-1)
         6.8.6.6. Both the parent or guardian and the juvenile will be advised of the juvenile’s
         rights IAW 5th Amendment, US Constitution. Document rights advisement via AF
         Form 1168. The juvenile and/or parent or guardian acknowledges their rights by
         initialing and signing the AF Form 1168. Check with the servicing legal office for
         applicable local laws. (T-0)
         6.8.6.7. Terminate the interview if the parent, guardian or juvenile request legal
         counsel.
         6.8.6.8. Juveniles will not be cited via DD Form 1805.(T-0) Complete an incident
         report detailing the offense. The report will be forwarded to the installation
         commander or designated representative for action. (T-1)
             6.8.6.8.1. SF will release juveniles to their parent or guardian via DD Form 2708,
             Receipt for Inmate or Detained Persons. If a major offense is involved (rape,
             armed robbery), the initial interview is deferred to AFOSI or other appropriate
             authorities maintaining jurisdiction. In cases where the offense or condition of the
             offender is serious enough to warrant detention, the juvenile will be released to
             civil authorities. If the parent or guardian cannot be reached or is unavailable,
             release the juvenile to the appropriate First Sergeant or Commander. (T-1)
         6.8.6.9. Installations will develop procedures for handling and disposition of
         juveniles who are involved in incidents violating “misdemeanor” level laws (i.e.,
         driving under the influence, vandalism, disorderly conduct, larceny, assault with
         injury, etc.). (T-1)
         6.8.6.10. Complete a blotter entry and incident report if necessary.
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                           29


6.9. Victim/Witness Assistance Program (VWAP). According to DoDD 1030.01, Victim and
Witness Assistance, and DoDI 1030.2, Victim and Witness Assistance Procedures, identification
of victims and witnesses is the responsibility of the agency that investigates the crime (e.g., SF).
The term “investigates” also applies to first responders. These two DoD publications and AFI
51-201provide guidance on the implementation of these programs in the USAF.
   6.9.1. Scope. VWAP applies to all cases in which criminal conduct adversely affects victims
   or in which witnesses provide information regarding criminal activity. Pay special attention
   to victims of violent crime, but ensure all victims and witnesses of crime who suffer physical,
   financial or emotional trauma receive the assistance to which they are entitled.
   6.9.2. SF Role in VWAP. SF members are critical members of a multi-disciplinary team. As
   first responders and SF investigators/detectives, SF members contribute to the success of
   other team members (e.g., AFOSI, SJA, Chaplains) who follow during resolution of the
   incident.
   6.9.3. SF Goals in VWAP. SF goals are more far-reaching than effective first response. They
   are:
       6.9.3.1. Immediate and permanent termination of the harmful act(s).
       6.9.3.2. Favorable resolution of the incident. Incidents are considered favorably resolved
       when offenders have been identified and held accountable, and the victim has been
       referred to the appropriate agencies for assistance in recovering from the incident.
       6.9.3.3. Recovery of the victim. Complete recovery from an incident is largely dependent
       upon a victim’s willingness to participate in the recovery process. SF will inform the
       victim of the resources available to assist in recovery. (T-1)
   6.9.4. Providing Information. Every SF member on-duty must carry a supply of DD Forms
   2701, Initial Information for Victims and Witnesses of Crime. Distribute the DD Form 2701
   to any person meeting the requirements of paragraph 6.10.1. When in doubt as to whether a
   person meets the requirements to be issued a DD Form 2701, issue the form. Annotate on the
   AF Form 3545A whenever a DD Form 2701 is issued. If an AF Form 3545A is not
   completed, the AF Form 53 must reflect a DD Form 2701 was issued. In addition to the pre-
   mentioned guidance, SF and SJA may develop local procedures to track DD Forms 2701. (T-
   1)
       6.9.4.1. Provide all victims with reasonable ideas for protection. Examples of reasonable
       ideas for protection would be properly securing homes, work places and property. For
       victims of domestic violence or abuse, staying with family members or friends would be
       an example of a reasonable idea for protection.
       6.9.4.2. Brief all victims and witnesses on the four phases of the judicial process
       (response, investigation, prosecution and confinement) and provide them with
       information on what may be expected from them during each phase. (T-1)
       6.9.4.3. VWAP training requirements are covered in AFI 51-201.
   6.9.5. If in the course of an investigation, either a victim or witness is threatened, S2I will
   advise the local AFOSI field unit commander or Special Agent in Charge (SAIC) and
   together they will assess if specific protective actions are necessary. If so, AFOSI will assist
   and coordinate with appropriate local, state or federal law enforcement authorities to take
 30                                                               AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


   action IAW AFI 36-2110, Assignments, to mitigate the threat. SF must also notify the SJA
   when they identify a victim. This allows the SJA to administer the victim/witness assistance
   process. (T-1)
   6.9.6. Units must "flag" incident reports to indicate it is a "victim/witness" case. Adding a
   prefix or suffix to the case number aids in the SJA auditing process of victim/witness cases.
   (T-3)
   6.9.7. Per DoDI 6495.02, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program Procedures, all
   SF personnel are required to complete initial and periodic recurring training concerning
   response to sexual assault incidents. This training will be completed annually and be
   documented on AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, in the
   individual training record using the Air Force Training Record (AFTR) system. HQ AFSFC
   has created a standardized Sexual Assault Prevention and Response for First Responders
   (SAPR-LE) Computer Based Training module. This training is located in the Security Forces
   Center of Training Excellence website, https://sf-cte.csd.disa.mil. (T-1)
6.10. Pre-trial Confinement. Under normal situations, pre-trial detainees will be detained
locally. Pre-trial detainees are confined IAW Rules for Courts-Martial, 304-308, and Article 13,
UCMJ, and are confined if they specifically meet the criteria outlined in RCM, Rule 305 (h) (2)
(B). Refer to AFI 31-205, The Air Force Corrections System, for further information.
6.11. Holding and Detention Cells. Holding and detention facilities support law enforcement
operations. Refer to AFI 31-205 for further information.
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                         31


                                           Chapter 7

                                         SEARCHES

7.1. Jurisdictional Authority to Search. SF may conduct searches on-base or off-base whether
CONUS or OCONUS. SF must ensure they adhere to local laws and policies as well as policy
established within this document and military/federal law when conducting any search CONUS
or OCONUS. Procedures for searches conducted in privatized housing will be established at the
local level IAW local and state laws. (T-1)
   7.1.1. Search authorization. A search authorization is an express permission, written or oral,
   issued by competent military authority to search a person or an area for specific property,
   evidence or for a specific person and to seize such property, evidence or person. Search
   authorizations are based upon probable cause and describe the person, place or thing to be
   searched and specific objects being sought. When practical, a search authorization (without
   the affidavit) should be shown to the concerned parties at the scene. An SF member should
   always attempt to obtain a search authorization. A search authorization will be completed via
   AF Form 1176, Authority to Search and Seize. An AF Form 1176 should be completed
   before the search. A verbal authorization may be sought in exceptional cases in which
   preparing the AF Form 1176 with affidavit is impractical or during exigent circumstances in
   where the delay could result in the loss or destruction of evidence. In these cases, the AF
   Form 1176 with affidavit must be completed as soon as possible following the execution of
   the search. (T-1)
       7.1.1.1. Search Affidavit. A search affidavit is a statement of “Probable Cause”
       supporting the request for authorization to search and seize. This affidavit must be
       completed by the person requesting search authority and if presented telephonically must
       be read word-for-word to an SJA from the servicing legal office. After coordinating with
       the SJA, the affidavit is (if presented telephonically) read word-for-word to the military
       magistrate or commander with the authority to authorize the search. This will ensure each
       party was given identical information. The best practice is for the request to be completed
       face-to-face (both for SJA coordination and magistrate request), in which case the
       magistrate can read the AF Form 1176 and affidavit. In cases where requests are
       presented over the telephone, it should be done through a conference call. In cases where
       time is critical (i.e., to prevent loss of evidence), the person requesting the search
       authority may orally relay the probable cause information and complete the AF Form
       1176 and affidavit as soon as possible. The affidavit must still contain the same
       information which was relayed to the SJA and the military magistrate or authorizing
       commander. (T-1)
       7.1.1.2. On-Base Search Authority. Although squadron commanders may authorize a
       search within their squadron areas, the common practice is to get search authority from
       the installation commander or military magistrate. The installation commander or
       military magistrate can order a search within any area of the base. Searches OCONUS are
       conducted in the same manner.
   7.1.2. Search Warrant. A search warrant is an express written permission to search and seize
   personnel or property issued by competent civilian authority. Because search authorizations
 32                                                                AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


   and search warrants refer to different concepts and are subject to different rules, personnel
   must maintain the distinction between them. The terms are not interchangeable.
       7.1.2.1. Off-Base Search Authority (US, possessions and territories). SF members cannot
       personally obtain search warrants to search off base quarters of military personnel. The
       installation commander’s authority to search does not apply off-base. Search warrants for
       off-base searches may be obtained and executed by civil authorities and, in some
       circumstances, AFOSI agents. SF members may participate in an off-base search, if
       requested to assist by the civil authorities, subject to the limitations of the Posse
       Comitatus Act (18 U.S.C. § 1385). SF members must be aware of the scope of the search
       by civil authorities. If a member subject to the UCMJ gives written consent for an SF
       member to search their quarters, a search may be conducted without a search warrant.
       Use AF Form 1364, Consent for Search and Seizure, to document this permission.
       7.1.2.2. Off-Base Search Authority OCONUS. Searches of the off-base homes and
       property of military personnel depend upon local agreements between the US and the
       host nation where American personnel are stationed. The commander of an AF
       installation issues procedures for off-base searches in a foreign country, with the advice
       of the local servicing legal office. Off-base searches of persons not subject to the UCMJ
       are the concerns of local authorities, unless otherwise stated in local directives or
       agreements.
   7.1.3. Search and Seizure in Postal Channels. Searches in postal channels require very
   specific handling. After letters and parcels have gone through the postal service and have
   been delivered, they become the personal property of the person receiving them. As personal
   property, mail is subject to search and seizure in any legal manner. While in postal channels,
   mail may be searched and seized following authorization from the Postal District Magistrate.
   If the mail is personal property located on a military installation (located in postal service
   centers or already received by the member) it is subject to search and seizure. Due to a lack
   of established case law, in all cases contact the local SJA for further guidance.
7.2. Search. A search is an examination of a person, place or thing with a view toward
discovery of a crime or criminal intent (e.g., stolen goods, burglary tools, weapons, etc.). SF
personnel conduct searches of persons, places or things within jurisdictional limitations.
   7.2.1. Illegal Searches. SF members who conduct unreasonable or illegal searches may be
   subject to criminal prosecution and civil action for damages. Evidence obtained in an illegal
   search may be inadmissible at a court-martial or other legal proceedings.
   7.2.2. Personnel Searches.
       7.2.2.1. Searches will be conducted IAW AFMAN 31-222. (T-2)
       7.2.2.2. Stop and Frisk. Stop and Frisk. An SF member may stop another person
       temporarily when the SF member has information or observes unusual conduct that leads
       him/her reasonably to conclude, in light of his or her experience, that criminal activity
       may be afoot. The purpose of the stop must be investigatory in nature. When a lawful
       stop is performed, the person stopped may be frisked for weapons, when that person is
       reasonably believed to be armed and presently dangerous. Contraband or evidence
       located in the process of a lawful frisk may be seized. The Supreme Court case Terry (v.)
       Ohio (1968) held that police may briefly detain a person who they reasonably suspect is
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                          33


       involved in criminal activity. NOTE: An SF member stopping a person must be able to
       point to specific facts or circumstances even though the level of suspicion need not rise to
       that of the belief that is supported by probable cause. A reasonable suspicion is more than
       a hunch.
   7.2.3. Property or Premise Searches. These must be conducted where objects sought could
   reasonably be found (e.g., if searching a room for a Big Screen TV, looking inside a small
   drawer would be unreasonable; confine the search to those areas where the TV could be
   located). The search ends when the object being sought is located.
   7.2.4. Common Area Search. A common area search is an examination of a common area
   such as a dayroom in a dormitory. A common area is, in real estate or real property law, the
   "area which is available for use by more than one person..." Any questions concerning what
   is considered common area should be directed to SJA prior to conducting the search.
   7.2.5. Confinement Search. A confinement search is an examination of the location where
   prisoners or detained personnel are held. Conduct confinement searches IAW AFI 31-205.
7.3. Probable Cause Search. Probable cause to search exists when there is a reasonable belief
that the person, property or evidence sought is located in the place or on the person to be
searched.
   7.3.1. The special court-martial convening authority at each installation may appoint a
   military magistrate to authorize probable-cause searches. The installation commander will
   sign the appointment and specify the installation over which the magistrate has authority. SF
   will obtain the installation commander's (or appointed military magistrate's) permission to
   conduct a probable-cause search. Use AF Form 1176 to document this action. (T-1)
   7.3.2. Most searches require probable cause (reasonable belief) or consent to be valid. There
   are unique situations where SF do not need probable cause such as when entering certain
   controlled or restricted areas.
   7.3.3. When justified, the manner and extent of the search are commensurate with the reason
   for the search.
   7.3.4. Normally, SF members do not conduct a probable cause search based solely upon the
   statement of one individual. The search authority may grant a search authorization if the
   reporting individual is considered to be particularly trustworthy or reliable. A search
   authorization request for such searches must detail why the person is considered trustworthy
   or reliable.
7.4. Search Incident to Apprehension. Supreme Court Case Arizona v. Gant (2009) Search
Incident to an Arrest. The ruling states, “when conducting a search incident to an arrest or
apprehension police may search, incident to arrest, only the space within an arrestee's
“immediate control,” meaning “the area from within which they might gain possession of a
weapon or destructible evidence.” The area within the person’s “immediate control” is the area
which the individual searching could reasonably believe that the person apprehended could reach
with a sudden movement to obtain such property. Any questions concerning what is considered
immediate area over which the apprehended/detained person exercises control should be directed
to the servicing legal office prior to conducting the search.
 34                                                                  AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


7.5. Motor Vehicle Searches Incident to a Lawful Stop. When a person lawfully stopped is
the driver or a passenger in a motor vehicle, the passenger compartment of the vehicle may be
searched for weapons if the SF member who made the stop has a reasonable belief that the
person stopped is dangerous and that the person stopped may gain immediate control of a
weapon. Furthermore, SF members may search an entire operable vehicle, including the trunk,
without the need to obtain a search authorization/warrant, if they have probable cause to believe
the vehicle contains contraband.
7.6. Search with Consent. Consent to search should be in writing, but may also be verbal.
Verbal consent should be witnessed by a reliable second party, preferably another SF member.
Ensure notes detailing the time, date and circumstances of consent are documented and included
with the report. If possible, obtain the written documentation as soon as possible after the verbal
consent; use AF Form 1364 if available. When the AF Form 1364 is not available, written
consent may be given in any format or on any available material. Such written consent may be
valid provided it indicates it was freely and voluntarily given and indicates the time, date,
individual(s) and place(s) to be searched. Ensure the individual reads their absolute right to give
consent to a search. Inform them that they can withdraw their consent to search at any time.
Ensure the individual understands that if they consent to a search, anything found in the search
can be used against them in a criminal trial or in any other disciplinary or administrative
proceeding. Ensure the individual understands if they do not consent, a search cannot be made
without a search authorization, search warrant or other authorization recognized by law.
However, regardless of consent from one individual with standing at a residence, if a second
individual with standing refuses to consent to the search, the residence cannot be searched (e.g.,
wife consents and husband refuses consent).
   7.6.1. The law may require rights advisement before, during or after requesting or receiving
   consent to a search, depending upon if and when the individual becomes a "suspect" and the
   particular investigative circumstances.
   7.6.2. SF must positively identify the non-consenting party. This can be done by their
   presence at the residence, the party reporting to the BDOC or through contact with an SF
   patrol.
   7.6.3. When time permits, secure a search authorization even if consent is provided in cases
   where consent might be revoked before seized evidence can be properly processed/searched;
   for example, urine and blood samples for urinalysis or Blood Alcohol Testing (BAT) testing,
   computers, cellular phones or other electronic equipment needing special processing. If a
   search authorization is secured, do not inform the consenting person of the existence of the
   search authorization. If consent is refused or is withdrawn, notify the individual of the
   existence of the search authorization and continue with the search.
7.7. Searches Conducted by Foreign Nationals. Command may not delegate the general
authority to order or to conduct searches to a foreign national. When making a lawful
apprehension, host-nation contract SF personnel may search the suspect's person, clothing worn
and the property in the suspect's immediate possession. Host nation contract SF personnel may
also search a motor vehicle that a suspect was operating or riding in as a passenger. US and/or
host-nation laws or agreements govern other restrictions or authorizations.
7.8. Random Installation Entry/Exit Vehicle Checks. Installation commanders may order SF
to inspect all or a percentage of motor vehicles/property entering or leaving their installation per
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                               35


AFI 31-113, Installation Perimeter Access Control; AFI 31-101; 18 U.S.C. § 1382; and MRE,
Rule 313 (b) and Rule 314 (c). Random Installation Entry/Exit Vehicle Checks are ordered at a
specific ratio (e.g., every 5th vehicle outgoing) by the installation commander. The purpose of an
entry/exit examination is to prevent introduction of weapons and other contraband as well as to
prevent the loss of classified information or government property. If an examination is declined,
you must make a walk-around check of the vehicle to look for any probable cause in plain view
(e.g., classified cover sheet, drug paraphernalia, weapon stock). If evidence is discovered to use
as a foundation for a search request, SF must obtain authorization to search from the proper
authorities (normally the installation commander). If there is no probable cause for a search, hold
the individual and contact the SJA for further advice. (T-0)
7.9. Exigent circumstances. Upon probable cause, SF personnel may search without a search
authorization or warrant when there is a reasonable belief that the delay necessary to obtain a
search warrant or search authorization would result in the removal, destruction or concealment of
the property or evidence sought. Circumstances surrounding the exigent circumstances must be
detailed in the AF Form 3545/A. Exigent circumstances may include the following: if delay may
endanger the life of the officer or the lives of others; if there is a likelihood that the offender will
escape if not swiftly apprehended; to prevent the offender from destroying or distributing
evidence; and if delay may enhance the offender’s ability to effectively and forcibly resist.
NOTE: SF members cannot cause the exigent circumstance and then use the situation to avoid
obtaining search authorization.
 36                                                                  AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


                                            Chapter 8

                    SEIZURES AND PRESERVATION OF EVIDENCE

8.1. Seizure. A seizure is the taking by authorities of items that are believed to be evidence of a
crime. Probable cause to seize property or evidence exists when there is a reasonable belief that
the property or evidence is an unlawful weapon, contraband, evidence of crime or might be used
to resist apprehension or to escape. Authority for search and seizure is dependent upon the
location in which a search is conducted and/or the person to be searched. This authority usually
depends upon whether the search is on base, off base, OCONUS or in US Postal channels.
   8.1.1. Property is most commonly seized in one of the following circumstances:
       8.1.1.1. Pursuant to a search authorization or warrant issued by a competent authority.
       8.1.1.2. Plain view: An SF member may seize objects which are in plain view if they
       have probable cause to believe the item is contraband or evidence of a crime. The SF
       member must be in the course of otherwise lawful activity and observe the property or
       evidence in a reasonable fashion. For example, an SF member stops a motorist for a
       minor traffic violation and can see a pistol in the car or a marijuana plant on the back
       seat. Horton v. California, 1990 US Supreme Court case, cited three conditions for the
       plain view rule to apply:
           8.1.1.2.1. The officer did not violate the Fourth Amendment in arriving at the place
           from which the object could be plainly viewed.
           8.1.1.2.2. The object's incriminating character must be immediately apparent.
           8.1.1.2.3. The officer must have a lawful right of access to the object itself.
       8.1.1.3. Exigent circumstances: See paragraph 7.9.
8.2. Preserving Evidence. Evidence must be protected from destruction, alteration or change.
Collect identified evidence as soon as possible and carefully document where, when and who
collected the evidence and the condition of the item. SF will maintain the chain of custody by
exercising the following procedures: (T-1)
   8.2.1. The SF member seizing or otherwise receiving an item of evidential property ensures
   all such property is immediately recorded on AF Form 52, Evidence Tag, and ensures the
   form is affixed to the item(s) of evidence.
   8.2.2. Record all circumstances surrounding the discovery of evidence (e.g., vehicle and/or
   property inventory, location of the discovery, date and time, witnesses present, etc.). These
   notes provide facts for an incident report. Additionally, SF personnel may use these notes to
   refresh their memory before testifying in court. As a minimum, file a copy of the notes with
   the incident report. Retain original notes as required by the Jencks Act.
   8.2.3. Ensure the AF Form 52 is annotated with the date, location, Security Forces
   Management Information System (SFMIS) case number (or blotter reference number),
   quantity, item, size, color, brand/style/model number, markings, approximate value, if
   known, and condition of the property, as well as the location of seizure and summary of
   incident. Additionally, if the evidence was taken directly from a person, annotate the name,
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                          37


  grade, status, unit and duty phone number of the individual from whom the property is
  received or seized. Ensure the tag is error-free and legible.
  8.2.4. A single AF FM 52 may be used if several items are seized in relation to the same
  case from the same location by the same SF member. Several items seized by the same
  person, found in the same place and related to the same case may be listed on a single AF
  Form 52. If all required information fits within the tag, then each of these tags, regardless of
  amount, will be labeled 1 of 1. If additional space is needed to describe or list items from the
  seizure, then list those additional tags as 1 of 3, 2 of 3, etc. NOTE: Use a separate AF Form
  52 to receipt for controlled substances, drug paraphernalia, firearms and ammunition from
  other items. This is due to these items requiring specialized storage separate from other
  items.
  8.2.5. Ensure the AF Form 52 is properly witnessed upon initial acquisition.
  8.2.6. Mark each item of evidence as soon as possible after its receipt/seizure. Place your
  initials, time and date of receipt/seizure in a place least likely to affect the item’s shape,
  appearance and monetary or evidentiary value. If the evidence cannot be marked, place it in a
  suitable container; seal and mark the container with your initials, time and date of discovery.
  Exercise sound judgment to avoid damaging a valuable item which may be eventually
  returned to its owner.
  8.2.7. The property receipt portion of the AF Form 52 is given to the person relinquishing
  the property. This applies to all property, even if the person relinquishing the property is not
  the owner of the property. If the individual declines or refuses to accept the receipt portion of
  the AF Form 52, that portion will be annotated to indicate the refusal or declination of the
  receipt. The completed AF Form 52 is then attached to the property.
  8.2.8. SF units must maintain the capability to store and release evidence IAW AFI 31-206.
  Security Forces members collecting evidence own the responsibility of ensuring the actions
  above are completed. S2I will not assume responsibility for evidence until evidence is turned
  over for inventory. Coordinate all releases of evidence with the SJA.
  8.2.9. In the event that evidence is explosive in nature, such as bulk explosives or military
  ordnance, the SF organization will request support from the installation’s (or closest unit’s)
  explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) team to provide guidance to the safe handling, packaging
  and storage of the explosive material. EOD teams will not be responsible for taking custody
  or storing the material.

                                           Chapter 9

                                 BOOKING PROCEDURES

9.1. Fingerprinting Suspects Suspected of Criminal Offenses . DoDI 5505.11, Fingerprint
Card and Final Disposition Report Submission Requirements, requires an FD-249, Criminal
Fingerprint Card, be submitted on all subjects under investigation by SF for offenses listed in
Attachment 8 of the DoDI. Attachment 9 provides guidelines to assist in determining when to
submit suspect fingerprints. Flights (S3/Operations) and S2I are responsible for fingerprint
collection and inclusion in reports. Reports and analysis should be responsible for FBI
fingerprint submission and follow-up. Security Forces Administration and Reports (S5R) receive
final disposition information and maintain records. The method of processing fingerprints must
be conducive to unit operations. (T-0)
   9.1.1. Units must complete two FD-249s (complete sets of fingerprints on both cards) and
   prepare a Form R-84, Final Disposition Report, when required. NOTE: If the subject’s final
   disposition is listed on the FD-249, there is no need to complete an R-84. Personnel must
   ensure administrative data required on both forms is the same. Where required, a Privacy Act
   Statement, Attachment 10, shall be provided to each suspect whose personal data is
   collected in accordance with DoD 5400.11-R, Department of Defense Privacy Program. (T-
   0)
       9.1.1.1. Units must ensure all fingerprints are legible and all information is collected on
       both copies of the FD-249. One copy of the FD-249 will be maintained with the case file
       or report and the second copy will be forwarded to HQ AFSFC/SFOP for submission into
       the FBI’s Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS) until digital
       means are available. (T-0) The address for where to send fingerprint cards is:

       9.1.1.2. The Form R-84 will be sent to Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) via
       the address located on the R-84. Postage paid addressed envelopes can be obtained from
       the FBI for sending the R-84s only. Do not use the postage paid envelopes for submitting
       the FD-249s to HQ AFSFC. (T-0)
   9.1.2. Offender criminal history data records required in accordance with this instruction
   shall be initiated by preparing and submitting an FD-249 and, when required, a Form R-84,
   or their electronic equivalents, to the CJIS Division.
       9.1.2.1. Military Subjects. Submit the FD-249 when an agent or law enforcement official
       determines, following coordination with the servicing SJA or legal advisor (in no case
       earlier than apprehension or the subject interview), that probable cause exists to believe
       the person has committed an offense listed in Attachment 8. (T-0)
          9.1.2.1.1. Within 15 calendar days after final disposition of military judicial or
          nonjudicial proceedings, or the approval of a request for discharge, retirement or
          resignation in lieu of court-martial, disposition information shall be reported by the
          DCIO or other DoD law enforcement organizations on the Form R-84, or an
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                         39


         electronic data transfer equivalent, if it has not already been reported on an FD-249.
         (T-0)
         9.1.2.1.2. Do not hold the FD-249 or Form R-84 pending appellate actions. Appellate
         action affecting the character of an initial disposition must be reported if it occurs.
         Dispositions that are exculpatory in nature (e.g., dismissal of charges, acquittal) shall
         also be documented on the R-84. (T-0)
     9.1.2.2. Civilian Subjects. Submit the FD-249 within 15 calendar days of the subject
     interview, arrest, indictment or information, as applicable, for offenses punishable
     pursuant to the U.S.C. that are equivalent to those listed in Attachment 8. (T-0)
         9.1.2.2.1. Submit the Form R-84 within 15 calendar days after sentencing. (T-0)
         9.1.2.2.2. Prepare a memorandum for the case file in cases investigated jointly with
         another law enforcement organization when that organization agrees to obtain and
         forward fingerprints and criminal history data to the FBI. The memorandum shall
         identify each subject and the law enforcement organization collecting and forwarding
         the data. A current memorandum of understanding or agreement at the organizational
         level, addressing the requirement to obtain fingerprints and associated data and to
         forward said information to the FBI, will suffice in lieu of case-specific
         memorandums. However, copies of the submitted data must be obtained for the case
         file. (T-0)
  9.1.3. Send the completed Form R-84 on military members to the FBI within 15 days after
  the SJA makes notification of final disposition of military judicial or nonjudicial
  proceedings. NOTE: Do not send Criminal History Data to the FBI for offenses disposed of
  by nonjudicial punishment if such punishment does not meet criteria outlined in Attachment
  8. (T-0)
     9.1.3.1. When submitting the FD-249 and Form R-84, charges must be described in
     commonly understood descriptive terms (e.g., murder, rape, robbery, assault, possession
     of a controlled substance) or by a commonly understood title. Offenses shall not be
     described solely by references to a UCMJ punitive article or to the U.S.C. or other
     statutory provision. Investigators must ensure that the charges annotated on the FD-249
     reflect the actual charges being pursued through court-martial or non-judicial
     punishment. (T-0)
     9.1.3.2. The disposition reflected on the FD-249 or Form R-84 must also be described in
     common language (e.g., conviction (include offense(s)), dishonorable discharge,
     reduction in rank, forfeiture of pay, charges dismissed). The disposition of “conviction”
     shall only be reported for crimes prosecuted by general or special court-martial yielding a
     plea or a finding of guilty. (T-0)
     9.1.3.3. Adverse findings resulting from a summary court-martial should be recorded as
     follows: “Subject found guilty by summary court-martial.” Although action by summary
     court-martial is disciplinary in nature for a violation of military law, the Supreme Court
     has ruled that a summary court-martial is not a criminal proceeding (see US Supreme
     Court Case 425 US 25, “Middendorf v. Henry”).
 40                                                                AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


      9.1.3.4. Adverse findings resulting from nonjudicial proceedings pursuant to Article 15
      of the UCMJ shall be recorded as “nonjudicial disciplinary action.” An adverse finding or
      punishment pursuant to Article 15, UCMJ, is a disciplinary action, but does not constitute
      a criminal proceeding or conviction. Approvals of requests for discharge, retirement or
      resignation in lieu of court-martial and/or a finding of lack of mental competence to stand
      trial shall be recorded as final disposition on either the FD-249 or Form R-84, as
      appropriate. (T-0)
   9.1.4. If at any time after an FD-249 and Form R-84 are submitted, you determine an error
   has been made or an appellate action changes the disposition, you must immediately notify
   the FBI. S5R must send a memorandum to the FBI to have the information corrected or
   withdrawn, as appropriate, within 15 days of notification of the appellate action. Include the
   Originating Agency Identification (ORI) number, file number, name and SSN of the subject
   with the correction or changed disposition. (T-0) Send the letter to:
                     Assistant Director, Criminal Justice Information Services
                     Federal Bureau of Investigation
                     1000 Custer Hollow Rd
                     Clarksburg WV 26306-0001
   9.1.5. Procedures for obtaining the necessary forms and training are found in DoDI 5505.11
   or the FBI website located at http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/fingerprints_biometrics.
   9.1.6. For identification purposes, suspects must submit two sets of fingerprints, regardless
   of requesting legal counsel or not. File the fingerprints. In the event the suspect refuses,
   contact the SJA for guidance.
9.2. Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA). DNA Collection Requirement for Criminal Investigations.
   9.2.1. Information. IAW DoDI 5505.14, Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) Collection
   Requirements for Criminal Investigations, SF shall take DNA samples, or direct they be
   taken, from service members and civilians, except for juveniles, who are suspects of criminal
   investigations under conditions outlined in Attachment 8 of this instruction. (T-0)
   Attachment 11 provides a flowchart to assist in determining when to submit DNA.
   9.2.2. Purpose. The purpose for DNA collection is similar to those for taking fingerprints.
   This includes making a positive identification and providing or generating evidence to solve
   crimes through database searches of potentially matching samples.
   9.2.3. Acquiring Collection Kits. DNA samples required by DoDI 5505.14 shall be collected
   with the United States Army Criminal Investigations Laboratory (USACIL) DNA collection
   kits. Kits may be requested from USACIL through their Combined DNA Index System
   (CODIS) Branch at Defense Switch Network (DSN): 797-7258, commercial (404) 469-
   7258, or via electronic mail (email) at codislab@conus.army.mil. The kit shall include the
   Privacy Act Statement as well as instructions for collecting DNA samples and requests for
   expungement. The Privacy Act Statement and notice of general rights for requesting
   expungement shall be provided to the offender when the sample is collected.
   9.2.4. Collecting Samples from service members. SF shall take DNA samples from service
   members and forward the samples to USACIL IAW Sections 14132, Index to Facilitate Law
   Enforcement Exchange of DNA Identification Information, and 14135 and 14135a, Privacy
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                        41


  Protection Standards, of Title 42, Public Health and Welfare, U.S.C. and the MCM when (T-
  0):
     9.2.4.1. DNA is collected for offenses identified in Attachment 8 when SF concludes,
     after coordination with SJA, there is probable cause to believe that the subject has
     committed the offense under investigation. SF must consult with SJA prior to making a
     probable cause determination. Samples may be collected, but not forwarded, prior to
     consultation. For the purposes of this instruction and pursuant to section 912a of 10
     U.S.C., Wrongful Use and Possession of Controlled Substances (commonly known as
     “Article 112a of the UCMJ”), DNA shall be taken from all drug offenders, except those
     who are arrested or detained for the offenses of simple possession and personal use.
     However, DNA will be taken from those excluded offenders when charges are preferred
     or the subject is convicted at special or general court-martial of simple possession or use.
     9.2.4.2. Courts-martial charges are preferred in accordance with RCM 307, Preferral of
     Charges, of the MCM if a DNA sample has not already been submitted.
     9.2.4.3. A member is ordered into pre-trial confinement by a competent military
     authority after the completion of the commander’s 72-hour memorandum required by
     RCM 305(h) (2) (C), Pretrial Confinement, of the MCM, if a DNA sample has not
     already been submitted.
     9.2.4.4. A member is confined to a military correctional facility or temporarily housed in
     civilian facilities as a result of any general or special court-martial conviction, if a DNA
     sample has not already been submitted.
  9.2.5. Expungement of Service Member Records. Current service members from whom
  samples are taken but who are not convicted of any offense by general or special courts-
  martial (including action generally inconsistent with such a conviction, such as
  administration of non-judicial punishment, administrative separation or referral to a summary
  court) may request in writing that their DNA records be expunged IAW the following
  procedures: (T-0)
     9.2.5.1. Requests for expungement shall be forwarded through the first commanding
     officer in the member’s chain of command, serving in the grade of O-4 or higher. Such
     requests shall include adequate proof that the charges have been dismissed, withdrawn or
     disposed of in a manner not resulting in preferral of charges pursuant to RCM 307 of the
     MCM or otherwise have not or will not result in a conviction of any offense (including
     proof of any action by a general or special court-martial convening authority that has the
     effect of a full acquittal).
     9.2.5.2. The first commanding officer in the grade O-4 or higher will review and confirm
     the information and then submit the request through SF, only if SF are the investigative
     authority, who will then validate the member has no convictions that would prohibit
     expungement and forward the request to USACIL.
     9.2.5.3. SF will send appropriate requests for expungement to USACIL. Requests will be
     on letterhead and bear the title, signature and telephone number of the law enforcement
     officer forwarding the request, preferably the S5 Superintendent, the NCOIC/Chief of
     Investigations or the S3 Superintendent of the responsible SF unit. Requests will clearly
     state that the member concerned is entitled to expungement and list the member’s full
42                                                                  AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


     name, Social Security Number (SSN) and mailing address. Requests will include all
     documents submitted by the member along with any additional relevant documents in the
     possession of the SF official receiving the request. SF should maintain a copy of all
     requests in the case file or with the report, including those requests not forwarded to
     USACIL because expungement was not appropriate.
     9.2.5.4. USACIL. Shall review requests for expungement to ensure they contain all of
     the required information. Incomplete requests will be returned to the submitter. When a
     request for expungement is received that is complete and appropriate, USACIL will
     expunge the DNA records, notify the member of its actions and maintain documentation
     of that notice.
     9.2.5.5. If the member’s commander, after consulting with the SJA, determines that
     expungement is not authorized, the commander should notify the requestor in writing
     with a copy furnished to S5R.
  9.2.6. Expungement of Former Service Member Records. Former service members from
  whom samples were taken, but who were not convicted of any offense by a general or special
  court-martial, may request in writing that their DNA records be expunged IAW the following
  procedures (T-0):
     9.2.6.1. Requests for expungement shall be submitted to the Headquarters Air Force
     Legal Operation Agency/Military Justice Division (HQ AFLOA/JAJM) and include all
     reasonably available proof showing that none of the offenses giving rise to the collection
     of DNA resulted in a conviction at a general or special court-martial (including a final
     court order establishing that such a conviction was overturned or establishing action by
     the convening authority that has the effect of a full acquittal). A court order is not final if
     time remains for an appeal or application for discretionary review with respect to the
     order. Such former members must include their name, SSN, current contact information,
     date of offense and contact information of the unit that the former member belonged to
     when the sample was taken. Requests that do not provide adequate information to
     identify the offense or to confirm the offense did not result in a conviction will be
     returned by “return receipt requested” with an explanation of the deficiency.
     9.2.6.2. HQ AFLOA/JAJM shall search their records for any conviction pertaining to the
     former member and determine whether the former member is entitled to expungement.
     HQ AFLOA/JAJM will send appropriate requests for expungement by former service
     members to USACIL. Requests will be on letterhead and bear the title, signature and
     telephone number of the HQ AFLOA/JAJM forwarding the request. Requests will clearly
     state that the member concerned is entitled to expungement and list the member’s full
     name, SSN and mailing address. Requests will include all documents submitted by the
     member along with any additional relevant documents in the possession of the official
     receiving the request.
     9.2.6.3. USACIL will review all requests for expungement received to ensure they
     contain all the required information. Incomplete requests will be returned to the
     submitter. For complete requests, USACIL will coordinate with the FBI to expunge the
     DNA profile from the CODIS database.
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                         43


  9.2.7. Collecting Samples from Civilians. SF will take DNA samples from civilians whom
  they detain or hold and who remain within their control at the point it is determined there is
  probable cause to believe the civilian has violated a Federal statute equivalent to the offenses
  identified in Attachment 8, except for the listed violations that are exclusively military
  offenses. For the purposes of this instruction, DNA shall be taken from all civilian drug
  offenders, except those who are arrested or detained for the offenses of simple possession
  and personal use. DNA samples may also be taken by civilian law enforcement
  organizations; however, an individual DNA sample does not need to be taken more than
  once. (T-0)
     9.2.7.1. DNA samples taken by SF shall be forwarded to USACIL. SF personnel shall
     document in the appropriate case file when civilian law enforcement organizations handle
     any aspect of the DNA processing and whether the civilian law enforcement agency
     forwarded the DNA sample to the FBI Laboratory. DoDI 5505.14 does not require SF
     personnel to take samples from a civilian not in their control at the point when a probable
     cause determination is made. (T-0)
     9.2.7.2. Civilians whose samples are taken and forwarded, but who are not convicted of
     any offense, may request in writing that their DNA sample be expunged.
     9.2.7.3. DNA samples shall not be taken from juveniles. (T-0)
  9.2.8. Expungement of Civilian Records. To request expungement of DNA records for
  civilians pursuant to Sections 14132, 14135 and 14135a of 42 U.S.C., the requestor or legal
  representative must submit a written request to:
                            Federal Bureau of Investigations
                            Laboratory Division
                            2501 Investigation Parkway
                            Quantico VA 22135
                            Attention: Federal Convicted Offender Program Manager
     9.2.8.1. If the request is for expungement of DNA records resulting from an arrest
     pursuant to the authority of the US, the requester must include, for each charge for which
     the DNA record was or could have been included in the national DNA index, a certified
     copy of a final court order establishing that such charge has been dismissed, has resulted
     in an acquittal or that no charge was filed within the applicable time period.
     9.2.8.2. The copy of the court order must contain a certification that it is a true and
     accurate copy of the original court order and be signed and dated by an appropriate court
     official, such as a court clerk. The copy of the court order itself must be signed by a
     judge, be dated and include sufficient identifying information (at a minimum, the
     person’s full name, SSN and/or date of birth) to determine the identity of the person and
     that the conviction offense was overturned, the charge was dismissed, the charge resulted
     in an acquittal or no charges were filed within the applicable time period.
  9.2.9. When expungement is prohibited. Expungement is not authorized under any of the
  conditions in paragraph 9.2.7, of this instruction if the individual seeking expungement has a
  federal conviction for a separate offense that should have but did not result in the collection
  and forwarding of DNA to USACIL IAW DoDI 5505.14.
 44                                                                  AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


   9.2.10. DNA/Fingerprint Refusal. SJA will provide local guidance should a military or
   civilian offender refuse to give DNA and or fingerprints. (T-0)
9.3. Defense Clearance and Investigations Index (DCII). AFOSI will index subjects of
criminal investigations, based upon reports of crimes provided by Security Forces, in DCII as
soon as it is determined that credible information exists that the subject committed a criminal
offense IAW DoDI 5505.07, Titling and Indexing Subjects of Criminal Investigations in the
Department of Defense. NOTE: Coordination will be made with the servicing AFOSI
detachment and S5R in regards to how the reports to be indexed will be received.   (T-0)
   9.3.1. Organizations engaged in the conduct of criminal investigations shall place the names
   and identifying information pertaining to subjects of criminal investigations in title blocks of
   investigative reports. All names of individual subjects of criminal investigations by DoD
   organizations shall be listed in the DCII. (This instruction does not preclude the titling and
   indexing of victims or "incidentals" associated with criminal investigations.) IAW AFI 31-
   206, SF will provide original reports of investigations, AF Forms 3545A, Incident Reports
   and CVB Forms 1805 to AFOSI for indexing within DCII. (T-0)
   9.3.2. The purpose of listing an individual or entity as the subject of a criminal investigation
   in the DCII is to ensure that information in a report of investigation may be retrieved at some
   future time for law enforcement or security purposes. The purpose of titling the report of a
   criminal investigation is to identify the subject for accuracy and efficiency of the
   investigative effort.
   9.3.3. The DoD standard that shall be applied when titling and indexing subjects of criminal
   investigations is a determination that credible information exists indicating that the subject
   committed a criminal offense.
   9.3.4. Responsibility for titling investigative reports and indexing shall rest with the
   investigative officials designated to do so by the heads of the DoD components.
   9.3.5. Titling an individual or entity is an operational rather than a legal decision. The acts of
   titling and indexing are administrative procedures and shall not connote any degree of guilt
   or innocence.
       9.3.5.1. The listing of a subject's name and other identifying information in the DCII
       indicates only that a report of investigation concerning that person or entity has been
       created.
       9.3.5.2. Judicial or adverse administrative actions shall not be taken against individuals
       or entities based solely upon the fact that they have been titled or indexed due to a
       criminal investigation.
   9.3.6. Once the subject of a criminal investigation is indexed, the name shall remain in the
   DCII, even if a later finding is made that the subject did not commit the offense under
   investigation, subject to the following exceptions (T-0):
       9.3.6.1. Identifying information about the subject of a criminal investigation shall be
       removed from the title block of a report of investigation and the DCII in the case of
       mistaken identity, i.e., the wrong person's name was placed in the report of investigation
       as a subject or entered into the DCII.
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                        45


       9.3.6.2. Identifying information about the subject of a criminal investigation shall be
       removed from the title block of a report of investigation and the DCII if it is later
       determined a mistake was made at the time the titling and/or indexing occurred, in that
       credible information indicating that the subject committed a crime did not exist.
   9.3.7. If a determination is made that a subject's identifying information requires removal or
   correction, investigating organizations shall remove such information as soon as possible and
   shall make appropriate corrections to all reports of investigation and the DCII, which shall
   include, if appropriate, entering the correct name on the reports and in the DCII. (T-0)
   9.3.8. An individual or a business entity seeking access to an investigative file must request
   the file from the organization that has custody of the file.
   9.3.9. When reviewing the appropriateness of a titling/indexing decision, the reviewing
   official shall consider the investigative information available at the time the initial
   titling/indexing decision was made to determine whether the decision was made in
   accordance with the standard stated in paragraph 9.3.3.
   9.3.10. An individual (or representative of a business entity) who believes they (or the
   business entity represented) were titled or indexed wrongly may appeal to the head of the
   investigating organization to obtain a review of the decision.
   9.3.11. Organizations engaged in the conduct of criminal investigations shall establish a
   written process, as further described below, whereby individuals or entities who have been
   titled or indexed may obtain a review of such decisions. A copy of that procedure as well as
   any subsequent revisions of the policy shall be provided to the Deputy Assistant Inspector
   General, Criminal Investigative Policy and Oversight, Office of the Inspector General of the
   Department of Defense. (T-0)
       9.3.11.1. The review process must include the requirement that an individual seeking a
       review of a titling and indexing decision submit a written request to the head of the
       investigating organization giving reasons for the reversal of the determination. (T-0)
       9.3.11.2. Heads of investigating organizations shall then solicit and consider written
       input from their applicable line and staff functions and obtain a legal review before
       deciding whether or not to reverse the previous titling or indexing decision. (T-0)
       9.3.11.3. The head of the investigating organization shall notify the requestor of the
       decision and provide information on other applicable agency channels from which to seek
       relief (e.g., boards for the correction of military records). (T-0)
       9.3.11.4. Decisions on whether or not to reverse the decision shall be documented and
       appropriately filed. (T-0)
9.4. Considerations. Units should coordinate with the local SJA and OSI for the execution of
the booking system. This is especially true for DNA collection and submission of DCII data. The
ultimate goal of these DoD policies is to ensure the establishment of criminal records for
offenders. Proper execution of the policy and proper completion of the forms will ensure these
records are created.
9.5. Training. Units should develop training on the booking process and incorporate it into the
unit’s training plan.

                                            Chapter 10

                                    RIGHTS ADVISEMENT

10.1. The Fifth Amendment. The Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution specifies that “no
person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself”. This means that
individuals subject to custodial interrogation by law enforcement personnel must be informed of
their Constitutional rights under the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. (T-0)
10.2. Article 31, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Under Article 31, UCMJ, it is
not necessary for a military member to be apprehended or arrested for Article 31 rights to apply.
Personnel who are subject to the UCMJ must always be informed of their Article 31 rights,
before any questioning, as soon as they are suspected of a crime. (T-0)
   10.2.1. Article 31 (b) states, “no person subject to this chapter may compel any person to
   incriminate himself or to answer any questions the answer to which may tend to incriminate
   him."
       10.2.1.1. The privilege against self-incrimination is applicable only to evidence that is of
       a testimonial or communicative nature. The privilege applies to more than verbal or
       written statements or confessions. Nonverbal communicative acts, such as head, hand or
       eye movements may also be protected. Additionally, a person has the right to not make a
       statement, even if they do not appear incriminating.
       10.2.1.2. Compulsion or coercion is any kind of mental or physical force that causes a
       person to do something against their will. The suspect must not be threatened, tricked or
       coerced into waiving any rights; nor can they be promised anything to waive their rights.
   10.2.2. Article 31 (b) states, "No person subject to this chapter may interrogate or request
   any statement from an accused or a person suspected of an offense without first informing
   him of the nature of the accusation and advising him that he does not have to make any
   statement regarding the offense of which he is accused or suspected, and that any statement
   made by him may be used as evidence against him in a trial by courts-martial." Always use
   either AFVA 31-231 or an AF Form 1168 to inform a person of their rights. Prior to any
   interrogation or statement request, Military Rules of Evidence (MRE) Rule 305 (c) and (d)
   requires that an accused or a person suspected of an offense be (T-0):
       10.2.2.1. Informed of the Nature of the Accusation. Suspects must be informed of the
       nature of the offense for which they are being questioned. Do not quote specific articles,
       instead use common language of the type of crime suspected. The explanation of the
       nature of the offense must include the crime involved and the place of the incident
       (example: Theft of government computers from Building 1351, Joint Base San Antonio-
       Lackland TX). It should not normally disclose the identity of witnesses or sources,
       specific detailed testimony or facts. It is not considered adequate to simply advise the
       suspect the investigation concerns a specific case type such as larceny, misconduct, etc.
       10.2.2.2. Advised of the right to remain silent; that is say nothing at all.
       10.2.2.3. Advised that any statement made may be used as evidence against the accused
       or suspect in a trial by courts-martial.
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                          47


       10.2.2.4. Advised they have a right to legal counsel and to have a lawyer present during
       the interview.
           10.2.2.4.1. As a result of court decisions, a person accused or suspected of an offense
           has a right to consult a lawyer before being questioned and a right to have a civilian
           lawyer present during any questioning; and that, if they are unable to afford a lawyer,
           one will be appointed for them, at their request. Under military law, this applies to
           military members, with the further provision that a military lawyer will be provided
           on request regardless of whether the member is able to afford a lawyer.
           10.2.2.4.2. Consult the servicing legal office before interviewing subjects on behalf
           of a foreign law enforcement agency. (T-1)
   10.2.3. Ensure the suspect understands his/her rights and is willing to answer questions.
   Suspects must understand their rights before they can execute a valid waiver of those rights.
   Evidentiary problems may result if a statement is taken from a suspect who is too intoxicated
   or unable to understand their rights advisement for any reason, i.e., language barriers, mental
   challenges, etc.
   10.2.4. Cleansing Statements. If, during the course of an investigation it is discovered that a
   suspect was questioned or an incriminating statement made without a proper rights
   advisement, the information obtained may be inadmissible in a court-martial proceeding. The
   remedy is for the SF member to stop further questioning, advise the suspect that any
   statement(s) previously made was (were) obtained in violation of their rights and cannot be
   used against them. The SF member must then conduct a proper rights advisement and should
   the suspect waive their rights begin the questioning over. NOTE: Truly spontaneous
   exclamations or unsolicited statements made by suspects do not require a cleansing
   statement.
   10.2.5. Identify Conflicts of Interest. Immediately inform your Flight Chief if a conflict of
   interest exists (i.e., tasked with interviewing a relative, friend(s) or person(s) with whom the
   SF member is affiliated). Although the SF member may be comfortable with the interview,
   the potential perception of favoritism, discrimination or unfavorable bias must be taken into
   consideration.
10.3. When to Advise.
   10.3.1. Military members or personnel subject to the UCMJ suspected of committing a crime
   must be advised of their rights before questioning. Determine whether or not the member is a
   suspect by all known surrounding circumstances, not just by opinion or belief. If, when
   questioning a witness, the witness makes a statement that may be incriminating or causes
   suspicion, then at that point, the witness becomes a suspect. The SF member must stop the
   questioning and advise the individual of their rights.
   10.3.2. Civilian suspects do not have to be advised of their Fifth Amendment rights until
   they are in custody (a custodial situation is one in which the suspect's freedom of movement
   is restrained although they may not be apprehended).
   10.3.3. Whenever there is doubt, consult with SJA.
10.4. Rights Advisement Procedures. While there is no requirement that Article 31 (military)
or the Fifth Amendment (civilian) rights be read verbatim to an accused, it is essential that the
 48                                                                  AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


applicable rights provision be clearly stated before the suspect is questioned. Rather than
attempting to advise a suspect of their rights from memory, which may be called into question
during a court-martial, use the appropriate advisement of rights (Article 31, UCMJ, or Fifth
Amendment, US Constitution) directly from AFVA 31-231. Rights advisement must be given to
all suspects regardless of any explanation or statement by the suspect that they understand their
rights so they need no advisement. Advise the individual of their rights in the same manner prior
to any re-interview or questioning concerning any offense that would not be covered by the
original advisement and remind the individual of the original rights advisement. (T-1)
   10.4.1. In lieu of using the AFVA 31-231 for rights advisement, the advisement can be given
   directly from the AF Form 1168. This form is read, dated, completed and signed by the
   suspect before the actual questioning occurs. Before any statement obtained from a suspect
   during an interrogation may be admissible in court, the government must establish that the
   suspect waived their right to remain silent. The AF Form 1168 provides written
   documentation the prosecution may offer as evidence at a court-martial. The form also helps
   establish the suspect was properly advised of their rights. If the suspect declines to sign the
   AF Form 1168 (but does not request an attorney), the advisement of rights must be witnessed
   and the AF Form 1168 annotated to reflect the fact that the subject was so advised and
   refused to sign the form, but verbally consented to the interview. The form must be dated and
   signed by the interviewer and the witness. AF Form 1168 contains both the military and
   civilian rights advisement.
   10.4.2. Do not begin the interview until the suspect specifically states they understand and
   waive their rights. For example, if after the advisement of rights, the suspect states they do
   not want to answer questions or make a statement, but would like to ask some questions, the
   suspect should be allowed to ask the questions or otherwise make unsolicited comments. The
   interviewing SF member may make direct replies to such questions, but will not pose any
   questions or prolong the conversation in any way. The point of discussion should be to either
   proceed with the interview under the advisement or terminate the interview. If the suspect
   subsequently waives their rights, the interview may begin. If the suspect initially exercises
   the right to remain silent or exercises that right at any time during an interview, the interview
   must be terminated. Similarly, if the suspect initially exercises the right to counsel or
   exercises that right at any time during the interview, the interview must cease until counsel is
   present. The SF member must not reinitiate questioning without first coordinating the
   interview with the SJA. (T-1)
   10.4.3. If the suspect (or parent or guardian in cases involving juveniles [check local laws to
   define a juvenile]) states they want a lawyer, the interview must stop. The suspect must have
   an opportunity to contact and consult with a lawyer and to have a lawyer present during any
   subsequent questioning. (T-1)
   10.4.4. In cases involving juveniles, after proper advisement of rights and consent to be
   interviewed is granted, the interview should be done in the presence of at least one parent. If
   a parent or guardian cannot be present during the interview and the juvenile is 12 years of
   age or older, two SF personnel, preferably with one being the same sex as the suspect, will be
   present during the interview. No juvenile under the age of 12 will be interviewed as a suspect
   without a parent or guardian present. Also, if no parent is present, the SF member making
   contact with the parent or guardian must inform the parent or guardian that the juvenile has a
   right to counsel prior to the interview. Refer to local state laws for the definition of a
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                      49


  juvenile. NOTE: If local law stipulates conflicting ages, contact the local SJA for guidance.
  (T-1)
  10.4.5. When an SF member interviews an individual of the opposite sex, another SF
  member of the same sex as the interviewee should be present to witness the interview. If an
  SF member of the same sex is not available, a second SF member or investigator must
  witness the interview. (T-1)
  10.4.6. In foreign countries, consult the servicing SJA to determine the proper procedure for
  advising foreign nationals of their rights prior to an interview. (T-1)
  10.4.7. Once a suspect invokes the right to counsel, stop the interview. (T-0)
  10.4.8. If a member requests legal counsel, you must wait 14 days before re-approaching. If
  after 14 days the member has not obtained legal counsel, you may attempt another interview
  according to US Supreme Court’s ruling in Maryland v. Shatzer 559 US (2010). Regardless,
  coordination with the local SJA is vital. (T-0)
 50                                                                 AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


                                            Chapter 11

                                         INTERVIEWS

11.1. The Interview for Personnel Potentially Involved in an Incident. An interview is the
questioning of a person who has, or is believed to have, information of official interest to the
interviewer. In an interview, the person being interviewed gives an account of their knowledge of
an incident that is of interest to the interviewer. After the person gives their account of an
incident, the interviewer must review the information and clarify any points which are in
contradiction to previously obtained information or are just unclear or vague. NOTE: If a person
refuses to report to SF, seek advice from your servicing legal office. Also, it is a good rule of
thumb to always have two SF present for all interviews regardless of gender or age. The purpose
of an interview is:
   11.1.1. To gain information in order to establish the facts and to develop information on
   specific crimes and/or offenses.
   11.1.2. To verify or corroborate previously learned information.
   11.1.3. To identify any additional witnesses and to eliminate suspects.
   11.1.4. To identify perpetrator(s) and accomplice(s).
   11.1.5. To secure additional evidence.
   11.1.6. To discover details of other offenses.
   11.1.7. To document an individual’s knowledge/lack of knowledge about an event and
   record their recollection of what happened.
11.2. Interviews. An interview can be accusatory in nature. The interviewer informs the
suspect of the accusation and presents the suspect with facts tending to prove the suspect’s guilt.
   11.2.1. Custodial interview. A custodial interview is questioning initiated by law
   enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his
   freedom of movement in any significant way. In a custodial interview, civilians must be
   advised of the “Miranda Rights” prior to questioning. A military member suspected of
   committing an offense must be advised of their Article 31 rights prior to any questioning,
   regardless of whether or not they are in custody.
   11.2.2. Non-custodial interview. A non-custodial interview is questioning initiated by law
   enforcement officers when a person has not been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of
   his/her freedom of movement in any significant way and is free to leave at any time. A non-
   custodial interview of a civilian does not require a “Miranda Rights” advisement in order to
   use statements as evidence at trial. A military member suspected of committing an offense
   must be advised of their Article 31 rights prior to any questioning regardless of whether or
   not they are in custody.
11.3. Human Factors. Because human factors influence the outcome of an interview, the
interviewer must understand the interviewee’s motivation, fears and mental make-up.
   11.3.1. Perception of Memory. The quality of the information received by the interviewer
   during the interview or interrogation will be affected by the interviewee’s ability to recall
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                         51


   correctly and then transmit facts accurately to the interviewer. Many things may influence the
   perception of events, but the most common causes of mistakes made in recalling information
   are:
       11.3.1.1. Weakness of the interviewee’s ability to see, hear, smell, touch or taste.
       11.3.1.2. The location of the interviewee in relation to the incident.
       11.3.1.3. Lapse of time between the incident and the interview.
   11.3.2. Prejudice. Interviewees are sometimes influenced by prejudices. Specific information
   must be gathered instead of general information to prevent prejudices from influencing the
   disclosure of information given by the interviewee.
   11.3.3. Reluctance to Talk. Some interviewees may be reluctant to disclose information to
   the interviewer. There are many reasons for this but some of the more common are:
       11.3.3.1. Fear of Involvement. Some persons, not being familiar with investigation
       methods, may fear SF.
       11.3.3.2. Fear of Publicity. The fear of publicity or fear that the subject or suspect may
       seek reprisals against them or their families often keeps people from divulging
       information.
       11.3.3.3. Inconvenience. Many people feel that getting involved in an incident may
       require a great deal of time and do not want to get involved for this reason.
       11.3.3.4. Resentment toward Security Forces. People may have had previous negative
       experiences with SF and refuse to divulge information.
   11.3.4. Personality Conflicts (between the interviewer and the interviewee). The interviewer
   must recognize that personality conflicts between them and an interviewee can occur. If this
   occurs, the interviewer must not take it personally, but should let another interviewer conduct
   the interview.
11.4. Witnesses to Interview.
   11.4.1. Members of the Opposite Sex. In cases involving suspects of the opposite sex of the
   SF member, refer to the procedures as identified in paragraph 10.4.5.
   11.4.2. Juveniles. A witness must be available. If a parent or guardian of a juvenile cannot be
   present, at least one other SF member or investigator must be present to witness the interview
   and should, if possible, be the same sex as the juvenile.
   11.4.3. For all interviews. Another SF member or investigator, if available, should always be
   present, directly or indirectly (e.g., viewing via closed circuit television).
11.5. Who Security Forces Interview.
   11.5.1. Victims. A victim is normally interviewed to develop facts in an investigation.
   Because the victim may be emotionally upset, the interviewer must be careful that the
   information received is not distorted by the interviewee. A victim may be interviewed at their
   home, place of business or hospital. The interviewer may interview in a place of their
   choosing or at a place the victim has chosen.
 52                                                                 AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


   11.5.2. Witnesses. A witness is a person, other than a suspect, that has information pertinent
   to the investigation being conducted. Witnesses may come forward voluntarily, but
   sometimes must be sought by the SF member. Normally, the witness or victim will have
   information about how an offense was committed, who committed the offense, when the
   offense was committed and why the offense was committed.
   11.5.3. Complainants. A complainant is a person who reports an incident. They may be the
   victim and/or the witness.
   11.5.4. Suspects. The suspect is one who is suspected of being involved in committing an
   offense. If the suspect is not willing to come forward and tell their story, contact SJA for
   guidance.
11.6. Conducting the Interview.
   11.6.1. Preparing. When adequate time is available, the interviewer must thoroughly prepare
   prior to the interview. Preparation steps can include:
      11.6.1.1. Familiarity with the Case. The interviewer must, as much as possible, become
      familiar with the facts and background of the case.
      11.6.1.2. Background of the Interviewee. When time permits, a background check must
      be conducted prior to the interview. Facts of particular interest to the interviewer could
      be:
          11.6.1.2.1. Age, nationality, race and place of birth.
          11.6.1.2.2. Present or former rank.
          11.6.1.2.3. Education level, present duty position and former occupation.
          11.6.1.2.4. Habits and associates to include hobbies and other off-duty activities.
          11.6.1.2.5. Prior offenses committed.
      11.6.1.3. Information sought. The interviewer, prior to the interview, must decide what
      information he/she hopes to obtain during the interview. Identify the elements of the
      UCMJ Article or statute in question. Ensure the elements are applicable to the correct
      charge. Devise a list of questions to ask during the interview. The list will minimize the
      need to recall a witness, victim and complainant or suspect because the interviewer did
      not ask all appropriate questions in the initial interview (a witness, victim, complainant or
      suspect may be recalled if further questioning is needed at a later date).
      11.6.1.4. Seek clear specifics. Victims, witnesses and suspects sometimes talk in general
      terms or use slang which may be interpreted in different ways. Have the interviewee
      identify who they were talking about when they use terms such as he/she/they. Another
      example is when a person talks about smoking “weed.” Have them clarify what they
      meant by weed. Others are often reluctant to use offensive terms and may be prompted to
      identify what specific words they mean. Information should never be left to be assumed,
      such as using terms like: “the N-word” or “MF”, etc.
   11.6.2. Planning, Time and Place of Interview. Conduct the interview as soon as possible
   after an incident to preclude the interviewee from forgetting facts surrounding the incident.
   However, it may be advantageous to interview a person at a later date. In the case of a
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                         53


  cooperative witness, the interviewer may choose to interview the witness at the witnesses’
  convenience. Interviews must be conducted at reasonable times of the day and be of a
  reasonable duration. A person may be interviewed at almost any location needed.
  Uncooperative witnesses or suspects should be interviewed in an interview room. The
  interview room should be plainly furnished with a table and chairs and not contain pictures or
  other objects such as a clock that would distract the suspect. The interviewer must not have a
  phone in the room, but should have appropriate forms available. A "Do Not Disturb" sign on
  the door may preclude unnecessary intrusions during the interview.
  11.6.3. Introduction and Identification. At the start of an interview, the interviewer must
  identify themself and, if applicable, show the interviewee their credentials. All administrative
  data applying to the interviewee must be gathered at this time. The introduction allows the
  interviewer to evaluate the interviewee and give the interviewee time to relax and get in the
  proper frame of mind. The interviewer then should open with a general statement about the
  investigation without divulging pertinent information or specific facts.
  11.6.4. Approaches for Witnesses.
     11.6.4.1. Direct Approach. When the interviewee is unable or unwilling to give
     information freely, this approach may be used. This approach involves the interviewer
     asking direct questions to elicit responses.
     11.6.4.2. Indirect Approach. The indirect approach may be used with the cooperative
     witness or suspect. The interviewer asks a general question and allows the interviewee to
     tell the story. The interviewer becomes a "listener" instead of an "interrogator".
     11.6.4.3. Alternating Approach. The alternating approach is a combination of both
     approaches where the interviewer alternates between the direct and indirect approach.
  11.6.5. Conducting an Interview. The interviewer should establish rapport with the
  interviewee. This is done by relating to the interviewee through common likes, such as
  sports. The interview should remain somewhat friendly, but businesslike and professional.
  The interviewee should be made to feel that the information given is important and must be
  allowed to tell the story without continual interruption. The interviewer must avoid
  antagonizing the interviewee. Special care must be given to ensure the interviewer controls
  the interview at all times.
  11.6.6. Special Considerations.
     11.6.6.1. Victims. The interviewer must keep the emotional state of the victim/witnesses
     in mind when questioning them. If the victim is too upset, terminate the interview and
     reschedule it for a later date when the victim is capable of participating in the interview.
     Interviewing a victim in this state of mind can lead to obtaining distorted facts. When
     interviewing a victim, it is best to display concern and consideration for the victim so the
     victim feels as if they have come to the right place. This show of concern may also put
     the victim off-guard, if the victim is being uncooperative.
     11.6.6.2. Photographs and Sketches. Photographs and sketches may be useful in the
     interview. A photograph or sketch may be used to refresh the interviewee’s memory or
     help the interviewee explain relationships of people and things at the scene. Care must be
 54                                                                  AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


       taken to ensure all photographs and sketches are preserved and properly identified for
       further use in court.
   11.6.7. Note Taking. Special consideration should be given to note taking as the interviewer
   may need to refer to them months after the interview. Notes must contain the SFMIS case
   number, date of interview, person interviewed and the time of the interview. All pertinent
   data should be recorded to facilitate memory at a later date. Notes should be sealed in an
   envelope and submitted with the report. All notes to include original drafts are required to be
   available upon request during court proceedings as per the Jencks Act.
   11.6.8. Electronically recording the interview. An electronic recording of an interview may
   be beneficial during the investigation and later at a court-martial. Consult the servicing legal
   office prior to using electronic recording devices.
11.7. Closing the Interview.
   11.7.1. The interviewer should display their appreciation for the cooperation of the
   interviewee once the interview is complete.
   11.7.2. Make no promises to the interviewee in regards to confidentiality.
   11.7.3. Release military personnel who are subjects/suspects to their First Sergeant or
   commander via DD Form 2708, IAW AFI 90-505, Suicide Prevention Program, when
   interviewed by an SF member. Ensure you brief the Commander/First Sergeant of the
   specifics if there are concerns for the safety of the suspect or interviewee. Release
   disposition(s) of all apprehended personnel will be reflected in the appropriate report. (T-1)
   11.7.4. Release military personnel to the First Sergeant, Commander or designated
   representative (E-7 or above) when the First Sergeant or Commander are not available.
11.8. Evaluation of Information. After the interview, the interviewer should carefully evaluate
the information received. This can be done by comparing it to previously received information or
specifics which were observed at the scene of the crime. The attitude, as well as the emotional
state of the interviewee, may also aid in the evaluation of information.
11.9. Interviewing Civilians. Interviewing civilians is contingent upon the jurisdiction of the
installation. Interviews of civilians are normally limited to those that are voluntary as an
interviewee. If a civilian is suspected of an offense, contact the servicing legal office before
proceeding with the interview. If a civilian refuses to be questioned, simply make a written
memorandum indicating the facts in the situation. NOTE: Weingarten Rights--under Federal
law, employees who are members of a recognized bargaining unit are given certain statutory
rights. One of these rights specifically impacts upon the manner in which SF may conduct an
investigation. A civilian employee who is interviewed by SF personnel during the course of an
investigation, who reasonably believes that they might be disciplined, and who requests union
representation, is entitled to have a union representative present during the interview. There is no
duty to inform the individual of this right. The individual must be a member of a recognized
bargaining unit for the right to attach. Once this is established, however, and the individual
makes a request in any form for union representation, the individual must be given an
opportunity to contact the union representative prior to any interview. The union representative
has the right to take an active part in the interview, including the right to confer privately with
the employee prior to answering questions and have questions clarified prior to answering.
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                             55


Questions regarding the status of the individual as a bargaining unit employee, or possible delays
caused by the temporary unavailability of the representative designated by the union, must be
referred to the servicing legal office. (T-0)
   11.9.1. Ensure non-custodial civilian suspect interviews are properly conducted and
   annotated. Inform the interviewee that their presence/participation is voluntary; they are not
   required to answer questions and are free to leave at any time. If a suspect-interviewee
   declines to answer questions or at any point wants to depart, s/he should be able to do so
   without interference. Should the interviewee make incriminating statements, admissions or
   confess, they must still be allowed to depart. Upon coordination with JA, the person can be
   summonsed back at a later time for suspect processing: fingerprints, DNA, photos, etc. (T-1)
   11.9.2. In the case of civilians, all efforts will be made to release suspects to their civilian or
   military supervisor, military sponsor or a relative, if possible. Again the interviewer must
   make face-to-face contact and provide the escort with a briefing concerning the
   suspect’s/subject’s demeanor and perceived mental state so that proper counseling can be
   obtained if necessary. (T-1)
   11.9.3. In the event a civilian suspect is to be released on their own recognizance,
   investigators will first take into account the suspect’s emotional well-being. If it is suspected
   the person may pose a threat to themselves or others, then medical and/or local authorities
   must be summoned. The interviewer will brief authorities on any mental health concerns for
   involuntary medical evaluation consideration so that proper counseling can be obtained if
   necessary. Release disposition(s) of all apprehended personnel will be reflected in the
   appropriate report. (T-1)
11.10. Obtaining Statements. Whenever possible, obtain a written statement via AF Form
1168 from an interviewee. If the statement may have value as evidence, the statement should be
sworn to and witnessed. If unable to obtain a written statement from the interviewee, the
interviewer will complete a written statement via AF Form 1168 capturing the details of the
interview; the statement should be sworn to and witnessed.
11.11. Other Interviews. Interviewing occurs anytime you are asking questions of a person.
Basic information questions are used often to establish identity. You can always ask people for
identification, where they live, where they are from, etc. The nature of your questioning may
change based upon your intent. Questioning a suspicious person in housing will differ from
questioning a person suspected of a crime. The interviewing discussed above is primarily
focused on a specific offense or offenses and the Law and Order patrol is attempting to discover
evidence through an interview. Canvas interviews and field interviews are probably the most
common types of interviews SF will accomplish on a day-to-day basis.
   11.11.1. Canvas Interviews. Canvas interviews are conducted in the immediate areas
   surrounding a crime scene or incident site. They are used to obtain information and identify
   witnesses who may not come forward on their own and who may be able to provide relevant
   information to aid in the investigative effort. SF patrols may be required to conduct canvas
   interviews to determine facts about an incident subsequent to the initial response, as part of a
   preliminary investigation, or in support of AFOSI or SF investigators while they are
   processing the crime scene or incident site. Canvas interviews do not target specific persons;
   they target all persons within a specific area around a crime scene or incident site.
56                                                                 AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


  11.11.2. Field Interviews. Field interviews, unlike canvas interviews, target a particular
  person seen in an area. These interviews are conducted to find out what a person is doing in
  an area and to determine their activities. Field interviews are typically initiated upon
  observation of suspicious activity or due to potential association with a crime or incident.
  Any information collected during a field interview should be documented and forwarded
  through operational channels, via AF Form 3907, Security Forces Field Interview Card, to
  the investigations section for processing. Persons identified during field interviews may be
  contacted later for further interview if crimes are reported later in the area where they were
  stopped. Patterns of activity can also be identified if the same person is habitually stopped in
  an area where criminal activity is identified.

                                         TESTIFYING

12.1. The Importance of Testifying. The final and most important test of an SF member’s
effectiveness will be their appearance in courts-martial, federal magistrate court appearances,
pretrial investigations and discharge boards. The preparation of a case is made with the ultimate
goal of presentation. The precautions taken at the crime scene, preservation of evidence,
questioning of witnesses and suspects, as well as detailed incident reporting will all come
together at the trial or hearing. Through adequate preparation, appropriate attitude and testimony,
personnel will assist in securing a just decision. NOTE: Prior to testifying and preparing for
court or hearing appearances, SF members must consult with the servicing legal office.
   12.1.1. Preparation. Prior to being interviewed by counsel and testifying, arrange and review
   original notes, sketches and photographs to recall all details of the case and be ready to use
   them while testifying. Careful studying of all materials and facts prior to speaking about
   them will prevent error, confusion and inconsistencies, which may lead to a loss of poise and
   composure and, thus, undermine credibility.
       12.1.1.1. Review the report so the presentation will be consistent. Find out from counsel,
       when possible, what will be asked, how it will be asked and how the SF member must
       present the testimony. Report any irregularities about the formalities of the investigation
       of the accused to the trial counsel before the trial.
       12.1.1.2. Check personal appearance when preparing to testify. First impressions are
       important as a witness is called to the stand. The attention of the court is constantly
       directed at the SF member throughout his/her testimony. Regardless of the uniform to be
       worn, personnel must be correctly and neatly dressed.
   12.1.2. Attitude. The ultimate goal is to see justice done and the truth revealed.
       12.1.2.1. To be convincing as a witness and be successful in avoiding attacks directed
       toward revealing bias, prejudices, interest and lack of truthfulness, personnel must show
       no interest in the conviction or acquittal of the accused.
       12.1.2.2. The best way to show no interest when called to testify is to avoid having an
       interest in the first place. Always testify freely and frankly.
   12.1.3. Testimony. Skill, tact, poise and self-confidence are essential when presenting
   testimony.
       12.1.3.1. Speak in a natural, unaffected tone. The SF member’s speech must be business-
       like, clear and loud enough for all concerned parties to hear. Answers must be directed to
       the fact-finder. Avoid using police jargon during testimony. Always be frank and
       courteous and assume an erect but comfortable posture. Slouching or carelessness in
       posture may suggest an indifference to the issue at hand.
       12.1.3.2. Be certain to understand each question before attempting to answer it. If unsure
       of what is expected, ask to have the question repeated or explained. Always confine
       answers to the question being asked. Don't ramble or volunteer unnecessary information.
58                                                                AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


     12.1.3.3. Never argue with counsel or any party to a trial or hearing. Additionally, never
     lose composure or testify to anything not known as fact. If you do not know the answer to
     a question, say so.
     12.1.3.4. Testify to only those matters of personal knowledge. Give opinions, suspicions
     or conclusions only if asked directly. In most cases personnel will limit their testimony to
     what they themselves heard, saw, smelled, tasted, did and said.
     12.1.3.5. Refer to notes and memoranda. Witnesses may refer to notes and memoranda
     to recall facts that have become hazy or been forgotten. Reference to notes is usually
     permitted if individuals request permission to do so. Coordinate use of notes and
     memoranda with the counsel calling you as a witness.
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                          59


                                          Chapter 13

                                   CRIME PREVENTION

13.1. Introduction. Crime prevention is any measure taken to reduce the opportunity for crime
by enhancing the community’s sense of safety and security through measures to include
increased awareness and confidence, improved planning and design, as well as committing to
strategies and programs addressing risk factors. Crime prevention is the key to improve quality
of life issues in an effort to minimize hazards and threats within our communities which result
from criminal and anti-social behavior. Crime prevention helps protect our society by developing
an environment where crime cannot flourish.
13.2. The Air Force Vision. The vision of the Air Force Crime Prevention Program is to
address the causes of crime, reduce opportunities for crime to occur and reduce the desire to
engage in criminal activities. The program also establishes a collaborative partnership between
local law enforcement agencies and individual citizens, as well as for units and organizations to
develop solutions to problems and increase trust in SF.
13.3. Scope. Crime prevention is a command responsibility that requires planning, support,
awareness and participation at every echelon of command including tenant organizations. Crime
prevention is more than just security; it is a responsibility for all leadership levels on an
installation. Effective crime prevention requires interaction among commanders, staff, officers,
NCOs, Airmen, civilian employees, dependents and community policing against the total
criminal element.
   13.3.1. Purpose. Installation commanders will support crime prevention in an effort to
   protect personnel from criminal acts by minimizing the opportunity and inclination to
   commit a crime. A secondary benefit of a successful crime prevention program is it serves as
   an excellent public relations tool for the installation and for the Air Force.
   13.3.2. Staff Assets. Staff asset integration, involvement, resources and ideas are essential to
   the success of the program. Assets include, but are not limited to, the DFC, Mission Support
   Group (MSG), SJA, Installation Exercise and Evaluation Team, Base Finance, Alcohol and
   Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT), Public Affairs (PA), Sexual Assault
   Prevention Officer (SAPO), Family Readiness, Army Air Force Exchange Services
   (AAFES), Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA), Safety Officer, Facility Managers and
   Civil Engineers to include the Base Housing Office.
   13.3.3. Crime Prevention Program Promotion. Installation commanders should take
   advantage of available resources to promote the Crime Prevention Program. External news
   media reaches a wide audience and increases awareness of Crime Prevention and the
   command’s emphasis. Local broadcast media, newspapers and applicable installation social
   media sites are two platforms available to promoting installation programs. The installation
   Public Affairs (PA) office manages the media engagement program and can assist in helping
   promote the program. Local Area Network (LAN) announcements, banners, handouts and
   bumper stickers are other vehicles for promoting the program. Commanders at the unit level
   and higher will ensure command bulletin boards contain crime prevention materials to
   reinforce issues and points of contact or help phone lines. Commanders will further ensure
   command briefs encompass crime prevention information.
 60                                                                 AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


   13.3.4. Crime Prevention Funding. Funding crime prevention programs is the responsibility
   of the installation commander. The DFC will seek funding annually from the installation
   comptroller in support of programs. There are several other Air Force programs (drug and
   alcohol control counselors, Family Advocacy, Family Support Services, Sexual Assault
   Response Coordinator [SARC], etc.) who receive funding annually to support crime
   prevention programs unique to their areas of interest. Commanders and the DFC should work
   with such interest groups in a joint effort to promote crime prevention on the installation. (T-
   3)
13.4. Program Elements. A successful crime prevention program must be tailored to the
specific needs of an installation or command. Programs will incorporate three major elements:
education, prevention and enforcement. (T-3)
   13.4.1. Education emphasizes providing and presenting timely, pertinent information to the
   community. This is accomplished through continuous and comprehensive community
   interaction, crime prevention awareness training (briefs, etc.), news media (installation paper
   and television), the internet LAN (dedicated websites) and crime prevention material
   (pamphlets, handouts, etc.).
   13.4.2. Prevention focuses on reducing conditions conducive to criminals committing crimes
   against persons and property, such as maintenance of lights; demolition of old, abandoned
   buildings; neighborhood watch programs; and removal of abandoned vehicles. Prevention
   reduces the opportunity and desire to commit a crime.
   13.4.3. Enforcement ensures timely detection and investigation of criminal activity, as well
   as the apprehension and prosecution of criminals.
13.5. Objectives. The primary objective of a crime prevention program is to provide effort and
support which enhances Air Force resiliency and Air-Minded objectives by producing and
fostering a sense of community. Objectives are accomplished by:
   13.5.1. Increasing the morale and personal safety of all personnel on Air Force installations.
   13.5.2. Protecting government assets and personal property from theft, misuse and unlawful
   destruction.
   13.5.3. Reducing manpower, time and administrative costs in the investigation, pursuit and
   prosecution of criminal activity.
   13.5.4. Achieving maximum support and involvement of the entire installation population, in
   association with military police and local law enforcement agencies, for crime prevention
   activities.
   13.5.5. Ensuring crime prevention initiatives never compromise the safety and security of
   personnel. Conversely, properly designed safety and security programs should never
   compromise crime prevention efforts.
13.6. Crime Factors. There are three factors common to every criminal act: the desire of the
criminal, the ability to commit the offense and the opportunity to commit the offense.
   13.6.1. Early detection of crime leads to an increased chance of apprehending the offender
   and reduces the possibility of destruction of physical evidence which may be critical to the
   prosecution of the offender(s).
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                        61


   13.6.2. Crime prevention programs need to address hardening of likely targets of crime,
   recognition and appraisal of crime risks on the installation and an increased level of public
   awareness.
   13.6.3. One of the most significant factors in decreasing violent crimes is reducing alcohol
   and drug abuse. Commanders must continue to educate Airmen on the Air Force alcohol and
   drug abuse policy.
13.7. Responsibilities. Installation commanders are responsible for developing and maintaining
a Crime Prevention Program. The staff officer for the program is the DFC. Unit commanders are
encouraged to develop, support and maintain their unit program described in the following
paragraphs. (T-1)
   13.7.1. The DFC will ensure Police Services conduct a crime prevention briefing as part of
   the monthly Base Orientation Briefing for all newcomers. (T-2)
   13.7.2. Role of Security Forces. Security Forces role, though pivotal to crime prevention, is
   of an educational, technical and supportive resource--an "enabler or catalyst" rather than a
   "doer." The primary role of SF law enforcement is installation entry control, preventive
   patrol, armed response, detection and investigative services. SF also provides equally
   important technical services such as physical security and resource protection. Security
   Forces must constantly emphasize and reinforce community policing visions, values and
   mission within the installation by using their position to influence and educate others. They
   must support and articulate a commitment to community policing as the dominant way of
   doing business.
   13.7.3. Crime Prevention Program Manager (CPPM). The crime prevention program is a
   function of Police Services. The DFC appoints in writing an individual to manage crime
   prevention functions. The DFC focuses resources based upon installation requirements. The
   NCOIC, Police Services Branch or CPPM, will attend course WCIP07A, Resource
   Protection/Crime Prevention Theory, Practice and Management, PDS Code 1F2. (T-1)
       13.7.3.1. Considerations. Personnel selected for these positions should have top oral and
       written communication skills, have the flexibility to work with both young and mature
       groups and be willing to work varied hours. Crime prevention specialists keep direct
       communication with law enforcement shifts, investigations, reports and analysis and
       should have access to operations and command leadership.
       13.7.3.2. Crime Prevention Program Manager Responsibilities. Coordinate and maintain
       a robust crime prevention program which includes:
          13.7.3.2.1. Providing annual and quarterly crime prevention statistics, rates and trend
          analysis to members of the IDC; and implementing programs identified by the IDC.
          This information will help examine crime patterns and use the data to determine
          strategies for employment of crime-risk management, as well short- and long-term
          crime prevention, to fight local crime problems. See paragraph 13.11., Installation
          Crime Statistic Reports and Crime Analysis. (T-3)
          13.7.3.2.2. Maintaining a current SFMIS account to pull crime prevention statistics
          to aid with developing rates and trend analysis on the installation. Security Forces
 62                                                                AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


          Investigations and Reports and Analysis will assist the CPPM with subject matter
          expertise with the creation of trend analysis. (T-3)
          13.7.3.2.3. Providing crime trend data quarterly and annually to unit commanders, SF
          Operations and other interested base agencies. SF uses this information to determine
          selective enforcement techniques and element-level crime prevention techniques. (T-3)
          13.7.3.2.4. Conducting and providing crime prevention surveys for installation
          organizations or personnel. See paragraph 13.10., Crime Prevention Security Surveys
          for Crime Prevention. (T-3)
          13.7.3.2.5. Serving as a liaison with local civilian police agencies to foster and
          maintain a working relationship in support of a coordinated security and crime
          prevention effort. (T-3)
          13.7.3.2.6. Conducting monthly crime prevention brief or as scheduled at the base
          orientation briefing for all newcomers. (T-3)
          13.7.3.2.7. Providing unit crime prevention briefs as requested. (T-3)
       13.7.3.3. Connection to Integrated Defense/Resource Protection Program (RPP). The Air
       Force Crime Prevention Program, by design, complements and works with AFI 31-101.
       The goals of both programs are achieved through active participation by the total Air
       Force community. It is vital for the CPPM to work closely with the Installation Security
       Section (ISS). The ISS works closely with facility managers and will help recommend
       crime prevention strategies for the installation to the CPPM.
       13.7.3.4. Working Relationships. The CPPM will have a working relationship with
       AAFES and DeCA Loss Prevention Officers to ensure the program is reporting incidents
       to Security Forces.
   13.7.4. Police Services. Police Services is responsible for maintaining a record detailing all
   crime prevention program activity. Using a memorandum for record (MFR), in accordance
   with AFH 33-337, Tongue and Quill, include the date, type of program, requesting
   command/unit/activity and attendance of other assisting agencies. (T-3)
13.8. Community Relations/Crime Prevention Education Awareness Programs. As a
primary source of information on crime patterns, Security Forces should provide guidance to the
community about prevailing kinds of crime and the specific mode of operation used by
criminals. Each base has its own unique community environment and crime prevention needs.
However, all base community members must be convinced of the need to protect themselves,
their neighborhoods and their work areas by supporting crime prevention goals. Understand that
prevention is a highly cost-effective alternative to the costs of crime to individuals,
neighborhoods and communities and realize crime prevention is everyone’s responsibility.
   13.8.1. Community Partnerships. Community Partnerships can be used to accomplish the
   two interrelated goals of developing solutions to problems through collaborative problem
   solving and improving public trust. The public should play a role in prioritizing public safety
   problems. This would include assessing needs, identifying problems, establishing objectives,
   coordinating training and managing program implementation. It further includes providing
   continuing analysis, program revision and community-wide crime prevention consultation
   services.
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                       63


  13.8.2. Community Policing. Successful community policing programs help prevent the
  most prevalent types of crime occurring on Air Force bases through maximum involvement
  of the Air Force community and SF in crime prevention activities. Participation in
  community projects that foster joint police and community efforts improves citizen
  awareness. By recognizing that police rarely can solve public safety problems alone, the
  community is encouraged into interactive partnerships with relevant stakeholders. The
  following types of programs, which the CPPM could use after determining their effectiveness
  and the needs of the installation, emphasize specific problems and precautions in protecting
  community members and their property:
     13.8.2.1. Operation Crime Stop. The primary objective of this program is to encourage
     community members to participate in the timely reporting of imminent or crimes-in-
     progress. Some people will report their observations to police only when they know they
     can remain anonymous. Operation Crime Stop helps overcome reluctance to become
     involved with Security Forces by providing a single telephone line for crime reporting
     while allowing witnesses to remain anonymous. Operation Crime Stop provides a safe
     way to report suspected or actual crimes anonymously. Anonymous crime reports can
     include school crimes, such as persistent bullying, domestic violence, suspicious activity,
     threatening acts or behavior, possession of weapons and or the use or sale of illegal
     drugs.
         13.8.2.1.1. Units with 911 systems may use this as their crime stop numbers. Units
         without 911 capabilities may install a dedicated Crime Stop telephone at the BDOC,
         capable of receiving calls from both on and off base, with a single number dedicated
         to Operation Crime Stop reporting. The number should be simple to remember and
         accessible from both government and commercial lines. Advertise the purpose of the
         dedicated line and the ability to remain anonymous. Distribute Operation Crime Stop
         reporting materials to other unit personnel and encourage their support of the
         program.
         13.8.2.1.2. Log each Crime Stop call on an AF Form 53, Security Forces Desk
         Blotter. Begin each entry with "CRIME STOP" to aid in statistical retrieval.
     13.8.2.2. Neighborhood Watch Programs. SF encounters situations calling upon us to be
     the eyes and ears of law enforcement. Not only does neighborhood watch allow citizens
     to help in the fight against crime, it is also an opportunity for communities to bond
     through service. This program is a vital tool used to educate the base populace about local
     threats on/off the installation, and to recognize and avoid situations in which they are
     likely to end up the victim of an assault or robbery. Helpful information to include in
     base programs from the National Neighborhood Watch Institute (NNWI) is located at
     http://www.nnwi.org/.
     13.8.2.3. Crime Hazard Identification Program. One goal of crime prevention is to
     identify, report and eliminate as many crime hazards as possible, thus reducing the
     opportunity for crime. Security Forces and base-level crime prevention program
     managers may solicit and issue Crime Hazard Reports to commanders and agency chiefs
     for corrective actions. Security Forces should leave a Crime Hazard Reminder when they
     discover unsecure vehicles, office areas, equipment or unattended property.
64                                                                  AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


     13.8.2.4. Citizen Awareness Program. The thrust of this program is to educate the base
     community on crime prevention. Base newspapers and other media are good outlets to
     get the word out on typical crimes, victims and offenders. The program provides
     prevention tips concerning crime trends and can target specific event crime prevention
     tips (Halloween, Christmas, etc.). Target areas include, but are not limited to:
        13.8.2.4.1. Personal security on the installation.
        13.8.2.4.2. Personal security while on leave and liberty.
        13.8.2.4.3. Security of personal property in the barracks.
        13.8.2.4.4. Quarters/home security and crime prevention.
        13.8.2.4.5. Underage alcohol consumption.
        13.8.2.4.6. Drinking and driving.
        13.8.2.4.7. Installation and state, county and city rules, regulations and ordinances.
        13.8.2.4.8. Identity theft.
     13.8.2.5. Crime Prevention Month. Using all available media, this effort is directed at
     increasing community awareness of the crime(s) affecting the community, what people
     can do in the community and what resources are available to deter and reduce crime.
     13.8.2.6. Military Working Dogs (MWD). MWDs are great deterrents to crime. Articles
     in the local news media announcing their presence and capabilities serve to increase
     public awareness and acceptance. Use caution when publishing precise details to avoid
     revealing law enforcement tactics or placing a handler and dog at risk for retaliation.
     13.8.2.7. Selective Enforcement. Selective enforcement focuses SF manpower on local
     crime and incident problems. It is based upon accurate analysis of the time, place, type
     and frequency of incidents or violations. The CPPM tabulates information from
     complaints, reports of offenses and vehicle accidents and provides the information to
     operations flight leadership for patrol activity consideration.
        13.8.2.7.1. A good analysis of this information will show the underlying conditions
        or behaviors that need to be corrected. In many instances, the information will help
        identify areas where selective assignment of SF will be an effective solution.
        13.8.2.7.2. Before applying selective enforcement to correct issues, the analysis
        should consider whether other solutions would be more effective. Example, analysis
        may show that using Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED),
        such as trimming shrubbery around facilities or improving area lighting in an area,
        may help harden the facility against crime. Another method that has proven to be
        effective is to post SF patrols at major traffic avenues to show police presence, such
        as in areas where speeding is at a reported increase. Using these methods and many
        others could be the best way to reduce crime incident numbers.
     13.8.2.8. Develop and implement a media campaign to publicize the base crime
     prevention program, prevailing crime problems and effective counter measures to these
     problems. Crime prevention awareness/education information will be presented on a
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                         65


       monthly basis to the base population via available news media. The installation’s PA
       office can help assist in the dissemination of material through installation sources.
       13.8.2.9. Conduct speaking engagements to promote crime prevention goals. Use
       Commander's Calls, First Sergeant Briefs, social activities, youth gatherings, spouses’
       club meetings, school visitations, etc.
       13.8.2.10. Assist in formulating youth activity programs and selecting volunteers to act
       as youth leaders and advisors in youth programs. These types of programs will actively
       involve youths and educate them to deter from criminal behavior; for example, Drug
       Abuse Resistance Education (DARE), Drug Education for Youth (DEFY) and youth
       camps.
       13.8.2.11. Conduct on-base residential, dormitory and work area crime prevention
       surveys for occupants and organizations.
       13.8.2.12. Request and distribute crime prevention literature and forms to promote crime
       prevention programs.
       13.8.2.13. Maintain close liaison with civilian organizations and authorities on crime
       prevention programs. Where possible, set up joint programs to promote military and
       civilian community involvement and combat mutual crime problems. Participate in local,
       state and federal crime prevention activities that benefit military communities.
       13.8.2.14. Encourage unit commanders to establish crime prevention programs within
       their unit and suggest they designate a focal point to coordinate program activities within
       the unit.
13.9. National Crime Prevention Programs. There are a number of crime prevention
programs available to commanders and CPPMs. National, state and local programs (National
Crime Prevention Council, state crime prevention offices, etc.) offer further guidance and
information. Commanders and CPPMs are encouraged to use all available assets to supplement
the program including installation specific designs. Installation commanders and Police Services
need to design their education and awareness programs around the specific needs of their
military community. Proven programs include:
   13.9.1. National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC). The NCPC is a nonprofit organization
   that acts as an advocate for crime prevention policies and programs throughout the nation. Its
   mission is to be the nation’s leaders in helping people keep themselves, their families and
   their communities safe from crime. The NCPC was founded in 1982 to manage The National
   Citizens' Crime Prevention Campaign, McGruff the Crime Dog and to administer the Crime
   Prevention Coalition of America (CPCA). NCPC granted authorization to the USAF to
   reproduce NCPC-copyrighted material. Security Forces may adopt elements of the national
   program to meet local needs. For further information, contact the National Crime Prevention
   Council, 2001 Jefferson Davis Highway Suite 901, Arlington VA, 22202, (202) 466-6272 or
   www.ncpc.org. NCPC manages the day-to-day activities of the public service advertising
   campaign by providing the following services to coalition members:
       13.9.1.1. Develops publications and teaching materials on a variety of topics about crime
       prevention.
 66                                                                 AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


       13.9.1.2. Offers a number of programs that can be implemented in communities and
       schools. Programs such as Be Safe and Sound in School; Crime Prevention Month
       (October); McGruff Club; and Teens, Crime and the Community are examples.
       13.9.1.3. Conducts local, regional and national training in crime prevention skills and
       techniques.
       13.9.1.4. Provides public service announcements broadcast nationwide starring McGruff
       the Crime Dog.
       13.9.1.5. Supports national coalition of crime prevention practitioners.
   13.9.2. The Crime Prevention Coalition of America (CPCA). The CPCA is a nonpartisan
   group of national, state, federal and community-based organizations united to promote
   citizen action to prevent crime. The USAF is one of the original members of this broad-
   based, interdisciplinary group whose members represent youth development organizations,
   municipalities, law enforcement agencies, federal and state government representatives, state
   crime prevention associations and community-based groups.
   13.9.3. National Night Out. The National Night Out campaign involves citizens, law
   enforcement agencies, civic groups, businesses and local officials. National Night Out has
   proven to be an effective, inexpensive and enjoyable way to promote neighborhood spirit and
   police-community partnerships. Along with traditional tactical equipment displays, block
   parties and other activities, turning on outdoor and porch lights is symbolic of the
   community’s effort to fight crime and support local law enforcement.
13.10. Crime Prevention Security Surveys. Crime Prevention Security Surveys (CPSS) are
conducted to identify the nature, extent and underlying causes of criminal activity or conditions
conducive to criminal activity within an area or a specific facility. A CPSS is an analysis to
identify conditions that may indicate the presence of or potential for criminal conduct. CPSSs
recommend corrective action to a commander or personnel to reduce the opportunity for crime.
   13.10.1. Residential, Commercial and Industrial CPSSs. Security Forces units may establish
   a program to offer CPSSs to residents of base housing, dormitories and to units of activities
   not normally inspected or surveyed under the resource protection program. These CPSSs
   educate personnel on how to protect themselves and their property. The CPSS is a critical
   analysis of the physical protection of the facility. Coordinate CPSSs with ISS, SF
   Investigations and AFOSI when done as part of the RPP and Force Protection program.
   When feasible, the CPPM should use help from SF law enforcement patrols who normally
   patrol the area.
   13.10.2. CPSSs will be scheduled with the responsible organization or individual.
   Organizations will assign an individual or the requesting individual will be available to assist
   the CPPM during the course of the CPSS.
   13.10.3. CPSSs will be completed using the CPSS checklist posted on the Security Forces
   website or any local agency CPSS, so long as it meets or exceeds the CPSS checklist. The
   CPSS checklist is used to incorporate all observations, findings and recommendations noted
   during the CPSS. Use the IN TURN Memo, Attachment 11, for a final report; an example is
   also provided on the Security Forces website for an Industrial Survey. Once the report is
   completed, the CPPM will ensure all agencies involved, to include the DFC, AFOSI, SF
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                         67


   Investigations, Safety Officer, Fire Chief, ISS and the requester, are provided a copy. CPSSs
   will be conducted at the following facilities as needed or requested:
       13.10.3.1. Enlisted/Officer Quarters, On-Base Housing and Privatized Housing.
       13.10.3.2. Government facilities that maintain negotiable instruments (cash, checks,
       etc.).
       13.10.3.3. Facilities designated by the installation commander.
       13.10.3.4. Facilities requested by unit commanders, at the discretion of the DFC.
       13.10.3.5. Tenant organizations such as banks, credit unions and concessionaires, as
       noted in the installation/organization Memorandum of Agreement (MOA).
13.11. Installation Crime Statistic Reports (ICSR) and Crime Analysis. Crime analysis is a
systematic, analytical process that provides information regarding crime trends and patterns on
the installation. An effective crime prevention program requires a systematic approach. Crime
analysis identifies target areas for increased crime prevention efforts. Crime prevention action
should be grounded in research, tested approaches and aided by evaluation.
   13.11.1. The most commonly used process for supporting and maintaining crime analysis is
   crime mapping. Crime mapping involves the use of color-coded pins to identify specific
   crimes. A crime is plotted on an installation map at the location of the crime. To produce
   accurate and effective crime analysis using crime mapping, there are three factors to
   consider: the purpose of the map, the audience of the map and types of data to include in the
   map.
       13.11.1.1. The goal of crime mapping is to identify problem areas on the installation that
       require increased crime prevention efforts. These efforts may include additional SF
       patrols, increased education or command attention. Crime mapping provides a visual
       media that isolates problem areas and may be included in the plan of action to reduce
       criminal activity in the area. Crime mapping must be maintained in order to be effective.
       13.11.1.2. Automated software applications are available for crime mapping. Some of
       the systems may be used in conjunction with a Global Positioning System (GPS).
   13.11.2. Statistical law enforcement reports are the foundation for analyzing violation and
   enforcement problems. The statistical analysis provides information for program planning,
   program changes and management decisions that can have a positive result on violation
   prevention, vandalism, theft, resource damage and public protection.
   13.11.3. ICSR will be pulled no later than 1 February of the following calendar year for the
   1 January to 31 December annual report and will be pulled the first month of the prior quarter
   for quarterly reports. This report will be cumulative in nature, and its information used for
   the quarterly/annual briefings with the IDC, DFC and Security Forces. (T-2)
   13.11.4. Police Services will maintain ICSRs for the installation commander, DFC or other
   agencies upon request. All criminal offenses brought to the attention of unit commanders on
   Air Force installations will be reported to Security Forces for appropriate action. (T-2)
   13.11.5. ICSRs will be submitted on a SFMIS report or the AF Form 4443, Law
   Enforcement and Physical Security Activities Report (LEPSAR), (located on SMARTNet)
   SFMIS will be used to query statistics for the requested time periods. Instructions for pulling
 68                                                               AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


   queries can be located on the SFMIS Web Training Site. Reports will be retained by the unit
   program manager in accordance with the Air Force Records Information Management
   System (AFRIMS) as Security Police Activities Reports. (T-2)
   13.11.6. CPPM will compile statistical data and generate one annual report on all criminal
   activity. From this report, Police Services initiatives can be implemented and will assist to
   help installation commanders reduce crime.
13.12. Filing and Release of Law Enforcement Records. Administer all law enforcement
records in accordance with AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Program.
13.13. Armed Forces Disciplinary Control Board (AFDCB). Installation commanders will
establish and maintain an installation AFDCB IAW AFJI 31-213, Armed Forces Disciplinary
Control Boards and Off-Installation Liaison and Operations. The board will meet quarterly to
identify establishments/areas in local communities that are detrimental to the well-being of
military members. The board will coordinate and exchange information with other services’
installations in the area. Board results will be published and disseminated to keep all military
members informed. Unit commanders must brief their personnel and post the AFDCB findings in
conspicuous locations.
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                           69

          LESSONS LEARNED (L2) AND AFTER ACTION REPORTS (AARS)

14.1. Security Forces Lessons Learned. The L2 process exists to enhance readiness and
improve combat capability by capitalizing on the experiences of Airmen. It is vital for the current
and future operational capability of the career field that a robust process for L2 exists within SF
and that it retains command focus at all levels. SF is a large, dynamic career field that undertakes
a wide range of operations to counter a number of sophisticated threats. It is essential that all SF
ensure that any deficiencies be identified immediately and are raised and disseminated so that
action can be taken to mitigate them across the Air Force. L2 are observations that, when
validated and resolved, result in an improvement in military operations or activities at the
strategic, operational or tactical level and result in long-term, internalized change to an
individual or an organization. (T-3)
14.2. Security Forces L2 Responsibilities.
   14.2.1. The AF/A7S Director has overall authority for the Air Force Security Forces L2
   Program. The Director provides L2 guidance and represents the SF career field at the annual
   L2 General Officer Steering Group. (T-3)
   14.2.2. HQ Air Force Security Forces Center (AFSFC) serves as the AF/A7S L2 program
   manager. The AFSFC will manage and share SF-related L2 issues with AF/A9L,
   MAJCOMs, NAFs, DRUs, 422d Joint Tactics Squadron, other members of the law
   enforcement community and DoD L2 organizations. It will follow and provide L2 guidance
   and information to SF in accordance with AFI 90-1601, Air Force Lessons Learned
   Program. (T-3).
   14.2.3. The AFSFC Strategic Planning Cell (SPC) provides administrative, tasking and
   resource support to the AFSFC for L2. All MAJCOM A7S staffs will ensure that courtesy
   copies of all observations/After Action Reports (AARs) are forwarded to SF L2,
   afsfc.sfp@us.af.mil or sf.lessonslearned@lackland.af.smil.mil. SPC will act as the central
   repository for all SF L2 and as the primary Gatekeeper for data entry and management into
   the Joint Lessons Learned Information System (JLLIS) for the SF career field. SPC will
   validate, disseminate and resolve/track all L2-related observations. This will allow the SF
   career field to achieve quality solutions in a timely manner with maximum visibility in a way
   that offers maximum ease of use to the career field by centralizing the process within the
   AFSFC. Once an action has been resolved, SPC will initiate closeout actions in JLLIS and
   publish the results as appropriate (e.g., in a monthly newsletter, Community of Practice
   and/or SMARTNet). This does not impede the MAJCOMs’ or an individual’s ability from
   entering information into JLLIS. (T-3)
       14.2.3.1. JLLIS is the automated solution supporting implementation of the Chairman's
       Joint Lessons Learned Program (JLLP) IAW guidelines established in CJCSM 3150.25,
       Joint Lessons Learned Program. JLLIS facilitates the collection, tracking, management,
       sharing, collaborative resolution and dissemination of L2 to improve the development
       and readiness of the Joint Force. The validated information contained in this database
       enables actionable Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education,
       Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) and Policy changes to improve joint and combined
 70                                                              AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


      warfighting capabilities. JLLIS is the system of record for the DoD and the JLLP. JLLIS
      is the only vehicle used to implement the Air Force Lessons Process (AFLP). (T-0)
      14.2.3.2. Lessons Learned may be found and entered into the JLLIS web sites at
      https://www.jllis.mil/USAF (NIPRNET) or http://www.jllis.smil.mil/USAF (SIPRNET).
   14.2.4. The L2 process is not intended to bypass the chain of command. L2 is a command
   responsibility. Figure 1.1. depicts the L2 Process. Commanders will ensure L2 collection
   processes are established and implemented at the unit level. DFCs, SF/CCs and Joint
   Expeditionary Tasked (JET) team leaders (e.g., Tactical Security Elements, Police Training
   Teams, etc.) will ensure observations/AARs are captured from major operations,
   contingencies, key exercises, experiments and other significant events and topics identified
   by leadership. Refer to paragraph 14.4. for a detailed list of when observations and AARs
   will be submitted. (T-3)

Figure 14.1. L2 Process.




14.3. After Action Report (AAR).
   14.3.1. The primary vehicle for identifying observations and potential Lessons Identified is
   the AAR. Timely submissions of AARs (and individual observations which comprise them)
   are a command responsibility. (T-3)
   14.3.2. The AAR is a consolidated report that includes an executive summary covering the
   event information (e.g., dates, locations and participants) together with observations which
   could result in improvements in military operations. AARs enable deploying Airmen to
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                         71


   benefit from reports submitted by those who have gone before and help the Airmen fight a
   smarter more capable fight. (T-3)
14.4. AAR Submission Timelines.
   14.4.1. Unless otherwise stated, AARs will be submitted within 30 days of the event to
   which it refers. In addition to submitting AARs up the chain-of-command, a copy of all
   AARs and observations will be forwarded to HQ AFSFC/SPC at NIPR address:
   afsfc.sfp@us.af.mil or SIPR address: Sf.lessonslearned@lackland.af.smil.mil. (T-3)
   14.4.2. AARs will be submitted by DFCs, SF/CCs, JET team leaders or SNCOs responsible
   under the following circumstances: (T-3)
      14.4.2.1. Deployed Operations. At a minimum, submit two AARs: the initial AAR will
      be submitted 45 days into the deployment and the final AAR will be submitted 15 days
      prior to the end of the deployment. The initial AAR should focus on those urgent items
      which can positively impact pre-deployment training and/or the deployment process for
      follow-on forces. (T-3)
      14.4.2.2. During Operations. Within 3 days of an SF mission encompassing an
      engagement or incident where a significant change in enemy TTPs has been encountered,
      or within 5 days of identifying any equipment shortcomings or communication
      equipment problems. In addition to submitting AARs up the chain-of-command and to
      HQ AFSFC, also forward a copy to the 422 JTS at NIPR address: 422jts.ttp@us.af.mil
      or SIPR address: 422jts.ttp@mcguire.af.smil.mil. (T-3)
14.5. Required Reporting.
   14.5.1. The following list of incidents requires AARs. This list is not all encompassing as
   other situations will arise for which an AAR will need to be accomplished. (T-3)
      14.5.1.1. Terrorist Acts. Terrorist attacks at an Air Force base or its resources,
      bombings/rocket attacks and significant threats from known terrorist groups.
      14.5.1.2. Shooting Incidents. Any peacetime government firearms discharge meeting the
      reporting requirements outlined in AFI 31-117, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force
      Personnel. Report all instances where SF used deadly force in the performance of their
      duties.
      14.5.1.3. Security Incidents. This category of serious security incidents includes, but is
      not limited to, unlawful entry to aircraft, sabotage or attempted sabotage to AF aircraft, a
      breach of aircraft security, acts of vandalism directed at AF priority resources, hijacking
      or attempts, unauthorized entry into a launch facility, damage to aircraft and robberies or
      attempted robberies involving weapons, munitions or large sums of money.

      and inmates that experience serious injury while in custody.
      14.5.1.5. Combat Arms or Training Incidents. Unusual combat arms/training incidents
      that result in death or injury to participants or bystanders. Catastrophic damage has
      occurred to equipment, weapons or facilities during Combat Arms Operations or Training
      Exercises. Damage occurred by natural causes does not relieve the reporting requirements
72                                                              AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


     if negligence by individual(s) contributed to the damage. Any incident involving weapons
     when an accidental/negligent discharge has taken place.
     14.5.1.6. Miscellaneous. This category provides an avenue for an installation DFC to
     analyze and report any incident that may be of educational value for the SF career field.
     Examples of the types of incidents would be domestic disturbance response; loss of an SF
     weapon; base defense training accident; death of an SF member; injury of an SF member
     while making an apprehension; SF response to a potential suicide; and use of electronic
     control devices, e.g., TASERS, etc.
  14.5.2. Security Classification. The overall classification of the AAR must be identified as
  well as the classification of each paragraph IAW AFI 31-401, Information Security Program
  Management. (T-3)
  14.5.3. Attachment 13, “SECURITY FORCES LESSONS LEARNED/AAR FORMAT”

                                          Chapter 15

                SECURITY FORCES SYSTEMS AND ADMINISTRATION

15.1. Security Forces Management Information System (SFMIS). SFMIS is the system used
by SF to meet Defense Incident-Based Reporting System (DIBRS) reporting requirements. The
system     has    the   ability   to    store   and     recall  case    reporting,  generate
Suspension/Revocation/Debarment (SRB) Rosters, track and report individuals in the AF
confinement system, provide Combat Arms weapons qualification data/history, individual
weapons records and armory inventory features. The use of SFMIS is mandatory; however, the
Pass and Registration feature is optional. SF units at AF supported Joint Bases should make
every attempt to comply with DIBRS reporting within SFMIS when possible.
15.2. Defense Biometric Identification System (DBIDS). DBIDS is a DoD-owned and -
operated system developed by Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) as a force protection
program to manage personnel and access at DoD installations. It is a networked client/server
database system designed to easily verify the access authorization of personnel entering military
installations by the use of barcode, contactless and fingerprint biometric technology. The
program supports the adding, retrieving, updating and displaying of information for individuals
who require military installation access. The DBIDS software application is used to enter
personnel data into a database, capture biometric information and retrieve that data and biometric
information for verification and validation at a later time. DBIDS enhances the military law
enforcement mission to provide a safe and secure community through the electronic interrogation
of access credentials which provides positive identification of individuals requesting access to
the installation. DBIDS is the Physical Access Control System (PACS) of choice for the USAF.
The use of DBIDS is mandatory.
15.3. National Law Enforcement Terminal System (NLETS) and National Crime
Information Center (NCIC). NLETS/NCIC are non-DoD systems used by SF as authoritative
databases for criminal investigations. HQ AFOSI is the executive agent for the USAF, but
CONUS bases will normally gain access to the system through their respective state.
15.4. Security Forces Administration. SF units create a large amount of reporting for a
myriad of incidents and accidents. The system mentioned above and the forms briefly explained
below are the lynch pin to the administrative process for SF work.
15.5. Security Forces Forms
   15.5.1. AF Form 52, Evidence Tag. Use this two-part form to record evidence and maintain
   a chain of custody.
   15.5.2. AF Form 53, Security Forces Desk Blotter. Use this form to record a chronology of
   SF activities during a shift. AF Form 53 often contains sensitive investigative or Privacy Act
   information and must be controlled. Refer to AFI 31-120, Security Forces Systems and
   Administration, for instructions on distribution.
   15.5.3. AF Form 75, Visitor Pass. A pass issued to visitors of installations. The AF Form 75
   is generally computer generated in SFMIS.
   15.5.4. AF Form 1109, Visitor Register Log. Provides a log of visitors/and or personnel
   entering areas which the entry and/or exit is controlled.
74                                                                 AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


  15.5.5. AF Form 1168, Statement of Suspect/Witness/Complainant. Use this form to take a
  written statement from a suspect or accused person, witness or complainant. Also, the AF
  Form 1168 is used to advise an individual of their Article 31/Fifth Amendment rights.
  15.5.6. AF Form 1176, Authority to Search and Seize. Use this form to obtain authorization
  to search and seize per Chapter 8.
  15.5.7. AF Form 1313, Driver Record. Use this form as a cumulative traffic record (driving
  history) for drivers who are principals in motor vehicle traffic accidents or moving traffic
  violations IAW AFMAN 31-116, Air Force Traffic Supervision Program.
  15.5.8. AF Form 1315, Accident Report. Use this form to record investigations of major
  traffic accidents (refer to AFMAN 31-116).

Terms
Access Control—A principle of environmental design; effective access control prevents
unauthorized entry into protected areas.
Active—A status of a Lesson Identified indicating that the lesson is currently being worked to
resolution by an OPR.
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                            83


Activity Support—A principle of environmental design; activity support involves placing
activity where the individuals engaged in that activity will become part of the “natural
surveillance” system. An example of activity support is the installation of recreational facilities
and playgrounds in residential areas within observation of kitchen windows.
After Action Report (AAR)—The AAR is a consolidated report that includes an executive
summary covering the event information (e.g., dates, locations and participants) and
observations. Observations to be documented are those which result in improvements in military
operations. AAR observations should describe how the mission could be/was improved, potential
risks to mission degradation and how to mitigate those risks.
Air-mindedness—USAF SF Air-mindedness is a distinctive approach developed through
doctrine, training and experience. We understand how air bases operate and how its personnel
conduct their air, space and cyberspace missions. We understand how airpower missions add
value to Joint and Coalition Commanders and the assets that conduct these missions are most
vulnerable on the ground. Our air-minded approach and expertise enable the best possible
delivery of Integrated Defense effects to mitigate airpower vulnerabilities on the ground.
Apprehension—Apprehension is the taking of a person into custody. Any officer, warrant
officer, noncommissioned officer (NCO) or other person designated by proper authority to
perform guard, police or criminal investigation duties may apprehend a violator.
Arrest—In military terminology, arrest is the restraint of a person by oral or written order, not
imposed as punishment, directing the person to remain within specified limits. Distinguish from
the civilian concept of “arrest.”
Collection—Collection is a method by which observations enter the AFLP and involves formal
and informal methods. Observations can be “pulled” into the process through formal collection
efforts or they can be “pushed” into the process by organizations, units and individual Airmen. In
a learning culture, every Airman, civilian and contractor contribute to the AFLP.
Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED)—This concept recognizes that
by applying four principles – Natural Surveillance, Territoriality, Access Control and Activity
Support – to the design of quarters, structures, storage areas, parking lots and other areas, a safer
environment can be created. Examples include increased security lighting and strategic use of
symbolic barriers at likely crime targets and the incorporation of security concerns in the initial
design of new facilities.
Custody—The restraint of free movement following apprehension. An apprehension occurs
when an SF member clearly notifies a suspect that the suspect is in custody. Protect the health
and welfare of all apprehended suspects. Once a suspect is in custody, the Security Forces
member is responsible for their safety.
Desk Blotter—A 24 hour, chronological record of significant events during an SF tour of duty.
Detention—SF personnel may detain individuals while determining if a crime was committed
and who was involved. While detained subjects are not free to leave and may have their
movements restricted, they are not considered to be in custody or under apprehension. Detention
time must be limited to a reasonable time necessary to determine if a crime was committed and if
the detained individual was involved. Detained individuals cannot be transported from one place
to another during their detention.
 84                                                               AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


Dissemination—Dissemination is the distribution of Lessons Identified to organizations for
action, along with making lessons available for wider use. The goal of dissemination is to get
lessons to decision makers when needed to make more informed decisions.
Duress—Threats, violence, constraints or other action brought to bear on someone to do
something against their will.
Evidence—Something legally submitted in a legal proceeding to ascertain the truth of a matter.
Jurisdiction—The power, right or authority to interpret and apply the law. Refer to paragraph
7.1. for further description of military jurisdiction.
Juvenile—A “juvenile” is a person who has not attained his or her eighteenth birthday unless the
individual is an active duty service member.
Lesson Identified—A validated observation that represents a matter (e.g., capability, concept,
process, procedure) to be sustained, improved or developed. A Lesson Identified contains a
better way to accomplish a mission or task for learning by a broader organization.
Lesson Learned—An insight gained that improves military operations or activities at the
strategic, operational or tactical level and results in long-term, internalized change to an
individual or an organization.
Natural Surveillance—A principle of environmental design; natural surveillance is based upon
the fact that most criminals do not want to be observed while committing crimes. Areas should
be designed so that they are more easily observed by base quarter’s residents, housing
neighborhood occupants or base employees.
Observation—An input from any source into the AFLP. Observations contain information
regarding specific events, activities, circumstances or outcomes and should include sufficient
factual and contextual information to support their validation.
Plain View Doctrine—The rule that a law enforcement officer may seize objects which are in
plain view if they have probable cause to believe the item is contraband or evidence of a crime.
The law enforcement officer must be in the course of otherwise lawful activity and observe the
property or evidence in a reasonable fashion. It is an exception to the requirement for a search
warrant/authorization.
Physical Restraint—The loss of free movement that results from being taken into custody. SF
members must use the minimum force necessary needed to make an apprehension. The use of
force depends upon whether the offender submits to the apprehension and must remain
proportional to the level of resistance encountered.
Resolution—Process to ensure Lessons Identified are staffed for action. Resolution actions
should be captured in JLLIS or appropriate documents and tracked to closure.
Search—An examination of a person, property or premises to uncover evidence of a crime or
criminal intent.
Subject—A person, of which credible information exists that would cause a reasonable person to
suspect the person may have committed a criminal offense or otherwise make a person the object
of a criminal investigation.
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                             85


System of Record (SoR)—An information storage system (commonly implemented on a
computer system), which is the authoritative data source for a given data element or piece of
information. The need to identify systems of record can become acute in organizations where
management information systems have been built by taking output data from multiple source
systems, re-processing this data and then re-presenting the result for a new business use. Where
the integrity of the data is vital, a data element must either be linked to or extracted directly from
its system of record. The integrity and validity of any data set is open to question when there is
no traceable connection with a known System of Record.
Territoriality—A principle of environmental design; territoriality recognizes that humans will
take more of an interest in something they own or possess. The innovative placement of fences,
walls or shrubbery around base quarters to delineate “private” space is one example of the use of
territoriality.
Validation—Process to ensure an observation is reviewed by staff functionals and/or operational
experts to confirm an observation contains an identifiable lesson to be processed through the
AFLP.
 86                                                                  AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014

failing to enforce the law. In addition, SF personnel cannot accept any advantage, gratuity or
reward for performing official duties.

Punishment of Offenders. SF has the authority only to apprehend or detain, based upon probable
cause, but Security Forces do not have the authority to punish offenders. Use discretion to
correct, caution or warn someone for minor violations of the law. Do not admonish or reprimand
violators.

Apprehension of Suspects. SF will always use the reasonable amount of force necessary when
apprehending and will protect the health and welfare of all apprehended suspects. Use force IAW
AFI 31-117, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel. The USAF will not tolerate the
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                          87


intentional negligent or mistreatment of apprehended suspects. Do not use abusive, profane or
insulting language toward a suspect or show disregard for the suspect's valuables, personal
property or physical well-being.

Dealing with Intoxicated Persons. SF will apprehend individuals who are, or appear to be,
intoxicated using proper communication skills.

Off-Duty Conduct. Security Forces is a high visibility career field and all members must remain
above reproach, to include their off-duty conduct.
Protection of Privacy. SF must protect private information collected during the course of their
duties. Do not discuss offenses or incidents, except in the line of duty. NOTE: SF must maintain,
protect and destroy private information IAW AFI33-332, Air Force Privacy Program.
88                                                                  AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014

                               SECURITY FORCES PLEDGE

                                I am a Security Forces member.

       I hold allegiance to my country, devotion to duty and personal integrity above all.

I wear my shield of authority with dignity, restraint, and promote by example high standards

                      of conduct, appearance, courtesy and performance.

                            I seek no favor because of my position.

 I perform my duties in a firm, courteous and impartial manner, irrespective of a person’s

                        color, race, religion, national origin and/or sex.

     I strive to merit the respect of my fellow Airmen and all with whom I come in contact.

                         SECURITY FORCES RESPONSE CODES

A4.1. Security Forces utilize response codes to rapidly and efficiently communicate status
between BDOC and on-duty personnel. Below is a list of response codes routinely used by
Security Forces. In the event these codes conflict with local Law Enforcement, the DFC may
consider restructuring response codes at the local level.
A4.2. Code 1 (Routine). When a call is not given a priority code, assume it is routine.
   A4.2.1. Respond by observing all traffic laws.
   A4.2.2. Never use emergency lights or siren for any routine call.
   A4.2.3. If circumstances are unknown to the dispatching agency, the response may be
   upgraded to Code 2 or Code 3, when reasonably justifiable.
A4.3. Code 2 (Urgent).
   A4.3.1. A call requiring an immediate response to a non-life-threatening emergency is
   normally assigned an "urgent" priority.
       A4.3.1.1. Respond by observing all traffic laws.
       A4.3.1.2. Use emergency lights for all urgent calls.
       A4.3.1.3. Sirens are not authorized.
       A4.3.1.4. The urgent call is also known as the "silent response." Use this type of
       response when answering non-life-threatening, crime-in-progress calls.
   A4.3.2. Check local, state, territorial or host nation traffic codes for limitations on use of
   lights and siren (some traffic codes do not support Code 2 responses).
A4.4. Code 3 (Emergency). A call requiring an immediate response to a life-threatening
emergency or emergency involving USAF priority resources is normally assigned an
"emergency" priority.
   A4.4.1. The use of emergency lights and siren is mandatory; however, use common sense
   when approaching the scene of the emergency.
   A4.4.2. If the emergency lights and siren put SF, victims or bystanders in peril, turn them off
   a safe distance from the scene.

             BLOODBORNE PATHOGENS EXPOSURE CONTROL PLAN

A5.1. Blood-borne Pathogens Exposure Control Plan. Each SF unit will develop a blood-
borne pathogen exposure control plan and make it readily available to all unit members. Ensure
the plan contains, as a minimum (T-1):
   A5.1.1. The exposure determination of personnel (those reasonably anticipated, as a result of
   performing their day-to-day duties, to have potential skin, eye or mucous membrane contact
   with blood or other potentially infectious fluids or materials). This determination includes:
       A5.1.1.1. A list of all duty positions in which personnel in those positions are likely to be
       exposed to contaminated material.
       A5.1.1.2. A list of all tasks and procedures, or groups of closely-related tasks and
       procedures, in which exposure may occur; tasks and procedures will be performed by
       personnel who handle contaminated material.
   A5.1.2. The methods available to prevent contact with blood and other potentially infectious
   fluids or materials.
   A5.1.3. Procedures for those who reasonably believe they have contacted a potentially
   infectious fluid or material.
   A5.1.4. Procedures for placing warning labels on containers or plastic bags containing blood
   or other potentially infectious material. Labels must comply with Occupational Safety and
   Health Agency (OSHA) Standard 1910.1030.
   A5.1.5. Procedures for keeping records of all incidents and occupational exposures per
   OSHA Standard 1910.1030.
   A5.1.6. Procedures for evaluating circumstances surrounding exposure incidents.
A5.2. Plan Review and Updates. Review the exposure control plan at least annually. Update
the plan as necessary to reflect new or modified exposure determinations. Coordinate with local
medical liaison to ensure relevancy and accuracy. (T-1)
A5.3. Training. Train SF identified in the exposure determination about the use of protective
equipment and disposition of possibly contaminated materials. Qualified SF or hospital
personnel may conduct this training. (T-1)
A5.4. EXAMPLE BLOODBORNE PATHOGENS EXPOSURE CONTROL PLAN.

Figure A5.1. Example Bloodborne Pathogens Exposure Control Plan
Workplace:

Date of Preparation:

In accordance with the OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens standard, 29 CFR 1910.1030, the
following exposure control plan has been developed. This document outlines the mandatory
requirements for all employees with the potential for exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens (BPP)
during performance of their assigned duties.
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                             91



1. Exposure Determination: OSHA requires employers to perform an exposure determination
concerning which workers may incur occupational exposure to blood or other potentially
infectious materials. The exposure determination is made without regard to the use of personal
protective equipment (i.e., employees are considered to be exposed even when they wear
personal protective equipment).

1.1. All workers in the following job classifications have the potential for exposure to BBP
regardless of frequency:

(List Job Title and/or AFSC for this category)

1.2. Some workers in the following job classification have the potential for exposure to BBP:

(List Job Title and/or AFSC for this category)

1.3. The following tasks and procedures have the potential to cause exposure to BBP:

(List Tasks, Job Title and/or AFSCs)

2. Implementation schedule and Methodology

OSHA requires that this plan also include a schedule and method of implementation for the
various requirements of the standard. The following complies with this requirement:

2.1. Compliance Methods

2.1.1. Use of standard precautions is mandatory in order to prevent contact with blood or other
potentially infectious material. All blood or other potentially infectious material will be
considered infectious regardless of the perceived status of the source.

2.1.1.1. Engineering and work practice controls will be used to eliminate or minimize exposure
to workers. Where occupational exposure remains after institution of these controls, personal
protective equipment shall also be utilized. At this facility, the following engineering controls
will be used: (List controls, such as sharps containers, etc.).

2.1.1.2. The above controls will be examined and maintained on a regular schedule. The
schedule for reviewing the effectiveness of the controls is as follows: (List schedule such as
daily, once/week, etc., as well as list of who has the responsibility to review the effectiveness of
the individual controls, such as the supervisor for each Department, etc.).

2.1.2. Hand washing: Hand washing facilities are available for workers who incur exposure to
blood or other potentially infectious materials. OSHA requires that these facilities be readily
accessible after incurring exposure. At this facility, hand washing facilities are located: (list
locations, such as patient rooms, procedure area, etc. If hand washing facilities are not feasible,
the employer is required to provide either an antiseptic cleanser in conjunction with a clean
 92                                                                   AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


cloth/paper towel or antiseptic towelettes. If these alternatives are used, then the hands are to be
washed with soap and running water as soon as feasible. The location, task and responsibility to
ensure maintenance and accessibility should be listed).

2.1.2.1. Hand washing is the responsibility of each worker. Supervisors are responsible for
enforcement of this policy.

2.1.2.2. Procedure: After removal of personal protective gloves, workers shall wash hands and
any other potentially contaminated skin area immediately or as soon as feasible with soap and
water as thoroughly as possible. If workers incur exposure in their mucous membranes, then
those areas shall be washed or flushed with water as appropriate as soon as feasible following
contact.

2.2. Needles: Contaminated needles and other contaminated sharps will not be bent, recapped,
removed, sheared or purposely broken. OSHA allows an exception to this if the procedure would
require that the contaminated needle be recapped or removed and no alternative is feasible and
the action is required by the medical procedure. If such action is required, the recapping or
removal of the needle must be done by the use of a mechanical device or one-handed technique.
At this facility, recapping or removal is only permitted for the following procedures: (list the
procedures and also list the mechanical device to be used or alternatively if a one-handed
technique will be used. Address these items being found as evidence in the field).

2.3. Containers for Reusable Sharps: Contaminated sharps that are reusable are to be placed
immediately, or as soon as possible, after use into appropriate sharps containers. At this facility,
the sharps containers are puncture resistant, labeled with a biohazard label and are leak proof.
(Employers should list here where sharps containers are located, as well as who has
responsibility for removing sharps from containers and how often the containers will be checked
to remove the sharps.)

2.4. Work Area Restrictions: In work areas where there is a reasonable likelihood of exposure to
blood or other potentially infectious materials, workers are not to eat, drink, apply cosmetics or
lip balm, smoke or handle contact lenses. Food and beverages are not to be kept in refrigerators,
freezers, shelves, cabinets or on counter tops or bench tops where blood or other potentially
infectious materials are present. Mouth/pipetting/suctioning of blood or other potentially
infectious materials is prohibited. All procedures will be conducted in a manner which will
minimize splashing, spraying, splattering and generation of droplets of blood or other potentially
infectious materials. Methods which will be employed at this facility to accomplish this goal are:
(list methods, such as covers on centrifuges, use of dental dams if appropriate, etc.).

2.5. Specimens: Specimens of blood or other potentially infectious materials will be placed in a
container which prevents leakage during collection, handling, processing, storage and transport.
The container used for this purpose will be labeled or color coded in accordance with the
requirements of the OSHA standard. If outside contamination of the primary container occurs,
the primary container shall be placed within a secondary container which prevents leakage
during the handling, processing, storage, transport or shipping of the specimen. Any specimens
which could puncture a primary container will be placed within a secondary container which is
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                            93


puncture resistant. (List how this will be accomplished, e.g., which specimens, if any, could
puncture a primary container, which containers can be used as secondary containers and where
the secondary containers are located at the facility.)

2.6. Contaminated Equipment: Equipment which has become contaminated with blood or other
potentially infectious materials will be examined prior to servicing or shipping, and shall be
decontaminated as necessary unless the contamination of the equipment is not feasible (see
attachment # X). (Describe the procedures to be used and any variations for surfaces or
equipment that cannot be decontaminated with soap and water, like computers or sensitive
electronic equipment.)

2.7. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): All PPE will be provided without cost to workers.
PPE will be chosen based upon the anticipated exposure to blood or other potentially infectious
materials. The protective equipment will be considered appropriate only if it does not permit
blood or other potentially infectious materials to pass through or reach the workers' clothing,
skin, eyes, mouth or other mucous membranes under normal conditions or use, and for the
duration or time which the protective equipment will be used. Protective clothing will be
provided to workers in the following manner: (list how the clothing will be provided to workers,
e.g., who has responsibility for distribution, etc., and which procedures would require the
protective clothing and the type of protection required; this could also be listed as an appendix to
this program). Potential PPE includes, but is not limited to:

Gloves

Face Shield

Protective eyewear (with solid side shield)

Surgical Gown

Shoe covers

Utility Gloves

Examination Gloves

Other PPE (list)

2.7.1. All garments that are penetrated by blood shall be removed immediately or as soon as
feasible. All PPE will be removed prior to leaving the work area. The following protocol has
been provided to facilitate leaving the equipment at the work area: (list where employees are
expected to place the PPE upon leaving the work area, and other protocols, etc.).

2.7.2. Gloves shall be worn where it is reasonably anticipated that employees will have hand
contact with blood, other potentially infectious materials, non-intact skin and mucous
membranes. Gloves will be available from (state location and/or person who will be responsible
 94                                                                   AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


for distribution of gloves).

2.7.2.1. Gloves will be used for the following procedures: (list procedures)

2.7.2.2. Disposable gloves used at this facility are not to be washed or decontaminated for re-use
and are to be replaced as soon as practical when they become contaminated or as soon as feasible
if they are torn, punctured or when their ability to function as a barrier is compromised. Utility
gloves will be discarded if they are cracked, peeling, torn, punctured or exhibit other signs of
deterioration or when their ability to function as a barrier is compromised.

2.7.3. Masks in combination with eye protection devices, such as goggles or glasses with solid
side shield or chin length face shields, are required to be worn whenever splashes, spray, splatter
or droplets of blood or other potentially infectious materials may be generated and eye, nose or
mouth contamination can reasonably be anticipated. Situations at this facility which would
require such protection are as follows: (list procedures/situations).

2.7.4. Other appropriate protective clothing to be used may include (add available PPE). The
following situations require that such protective clothing be utilized: (list procedures/situations
and PPE needed).

2.8. Contaminated Surfaces: All contaminated work surfaces will be decontaminated after
completion of procedures and immediately or as soon as feasible after any spill of blood or other
potentially infectious materials, as well as the end of the work shift if the surface may have
become contaminated since the last cleaning. Decontamination will be accomplished by utilizing
the following materials (list the materials which will be utilized, such as bleach solutions or EPA
registered germicides). Describe the cleaning procedure ((see attachment # X) and add any
information concerning the use of protective coverings, such as plastic wrap which is perhaps
being used to assist in keeping surfaces free of contamination).

2.8.1. Any broken glassware which may be contaminated will not be picked up directly with the
hands. Tongs or other tools will be used to pick up any object that could cause penetration of the
skin.

2.9. Regulated Waste Disposal: All contaminated sharps shall be discarded as soon as feasible in
sharps containers which are located in the facility. Sharps containers are located in (specify
locations of sharps containers). Regulated waste other than sharps shall be placed in appropriate
containers. Such containers are located in: (specify locations of containers).

2.10. Laundry Procedures: Laundry contaminated with blood or other potentially infectious
materials will be handled as little as possible. Such laundry will be placed in appropriately
marked bags at the location where it was used. Such laundry will not be sorted or rinsed in the
area of use. All employees who handle contaminated laundry will use PPE to prevent contact
with blood or other potentially infectious materials. Laundry at this facility will be cleaned at
(employers should note here if the laundry is being sent off site. If the laundry is being sent off
site, then the laundry service accepting the laundry is to be notified, in accordance with section
(d) of the standard).
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                           95



2.11. Hepatitis B Vaccine (HBV): All workers who have been identified as having exposure to
blood or other potentially infectious materials will be offered the Hepatitis B vaccine at no cost
to the worker. The (add medical unit) will provide the vaccine.

2.11.1. The HBV will be offered within 10 working days of a staff member’s initial assignment
to work involving the potential for occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infectious
materials unless the worker has previously had the vaccine or wishes to submit to antibody
testing which shows the employee to have sufficient immunity.

2.11.2. Employees who decline the Hepatitis B vaccine will sign a waiver.

2.12. Post-Exposure Evaluation and Follow-up: If a worker incurs an exposure incident, it must
be reported to their supervisor and follow-up should be as described below. All employees who
incur an exposure incident will be offered post-exposure evaluation and follow-up in accordance
with the OSHA standard.

2.12.1. The exposed surface should be IMMEDIATELY washed with soap and warm water for
at least 15 minutes or washed with copious amounts of water if soap is inadvisable (as in eye
exposures).

2.12.2. The exposed worker must notify their supervisor and report to the Flight Medicine Clinic
(XXX-XXXX) as quickly as possible. The worker will be evaluated at the Flight Medicine
Clinic to determine if they are a candidate for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Post-
Exposure Prophylaxis medication. This medication is most effective if given within 1 to 2 hours
after exposure. If the exposure occurs after normal duty hours, the worker should go to the
nearest emergency room as quickly as possible for evaluation and treatment.

2.12.3. The worker must also report to the Public Health office (XXX-XXXX) after he or she has
been evaluated. The Public Health office must be notified the next duty day for follow-up if the
worker was evaluated in an emergency room or a civilian clinic.

2.12.4. Contact information for the source of the blood or body fluid should be identified to
facilitate any needed testing and/or follow-up.

2.13. Training: Training for all employees will be conducted prior to initial assignment of 10
tasks where occupational exposure may occur. Training will include annual refresher training as
well as:

2.13.1. An explanation of the OSHA standard for bloodborne pathogens.

2.13.2. Epidemiology and symptomatology of blood borne diseases (statistics, signs and
symptoms).

2.13.3. Modes of transmission of bloodborne pathogens.
 96                                                                   AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


2.13.4. This Exposure Control Plan, i.e., points of the plan, lines of responsibility, how the plan
will be implemented, etc.

2.13.5. Procedures which might cause exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials
at this facility.

2.13.6. Control methods which will be used at the facility to control exposure to blood or other
potentially infectious materials.

2.13.7. Personal Protective Equipment.

2.13.8. Post exposure evaluation and follow-up procedures and reporting.

2.13.9. Signs and labels used at the workplace.

2.14. Hepatitis B vaccine program. (Employers should list here if training will be conducted
using videotapes, written material, etc. Also, the employer should indicate who is responsible for
conducting training).

2.15. Record Keeping:

2.15.1. Medical Records. Patient medical records are maintained by the (add medical unit).

2.15.2. Training Records. Upon completion of training, the employee will sign the AF Form
2676, Occupational Health Training and Protective Equipment Fit Testing, or other designated
form. A copy will be sent to Public Health and the original will be filed in a separate section with
the exposure control plan. These training records must be kept for a length of time determined by
the installation medical unit.

2.15.3. Each supervisor must document initial and annual training in Block V of each trainee’s
AF Form 55.

2.15.4. Initial training will be documented as “Initial Bloodborne Pathogen Training” and annual
training will be documented as “Annual Bloodborne Pathogen Training.”

2.16. Labeling. Contaminated items will be designated by placing them in a biohazard bag or
other appropriate leak-proof container which has the biohazard symbol and the word
“BIOHAZARD” clearly marked in red on the outside of the container. These containers will not
be used for any other purpose.
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                           97


                                          Attachment 6
         USAF SECURITY FORCES MODEL VEHICLE OPERATION POLICY

A6.1. Non-Emergency Operation of Security Forces Vehicle. SF personnel will:
   A6.1.1. Comply with all installation and state laws when operating USAF-owned or leased
   vehicles.
   A6.1.2. Use seat belts when operating any vehicle.
   A6.1.3. Ensure their vehicles have sufficient gas and oil and are checked for proper inflation
   of tires.
   A6.1.4. Inspect assigned vehicles prior to their shift for any damage or missing equipment,
   and inspect the rear seat area for contraband or evidence. Inspect the rear seat area before and
   after transporting any person.
   A6.1.5. Report all vehicle damage or missing equipment to a supervisor prior to placing the
   vehicle in service.
   A6.1.6. Keep vehicles clean and free of trash.
A6.2. Emergency Driving -- General (Non-Pursuit Situations). The primary concern in
emergency driving situations is protection of lives and the safety of all citizens and SF personnel.
During emergency driving situations, SF will operate their vehicles with extreme caution.
Driving under emergency conditions does not relieve the vehicle operator from the duty to drive
with due regard for safety of all persons, nor will these provisions protect the driver from
consequences of their disregard for safety of others.
   A6.2.1. Emergency Driving Defined. Emergency driving is operation of an authorized
   emergency vehicle (emergency lights and siren in operation) by SF personnel in response to a
   life threatening situation or a violent crime in progress, using due regard for safety. NOTE:
   Drivers should not use their emergency flashers during emergency driving as it will make
   turn signals inoperative.
   A6.2.2. Emergency Driving Conditions. The decision to drive under emergency conditions
   rests with each individual, subject to supervisory oversight, based upon the following
   conditions:
       A6.2.2.1. Consider factors such as driving abilities, traffic volume, time of day and
       potential hazard or liability to themselves and the public.
       A6.2.2.2. Make emergency responses only when the call involves a life threatening
       situation or a violent crime in progress.
       A6.2.2.3. Have sufficient information to justify emergency driving.
       A6.2.2.4. Even when responding to a "patrolman needs assistance" type call, SF must
       bear in mind that, while a rapid response is important, they must arrive at the scene
       safely.
   A6.2.3. Deciding to Make an Emergency Response. All personnel making an emergency
   response will immediately notify the BDOC of that action by using the term "Code Three."
   This indicates use of emergency lights and siren. The ranking individual on duty will
 98                                                                  AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


   override the vehicle operator's decision to make an emergency (Code Three) response if, in
   his/her judgment, it is not warranted or safe. (T-1)
       A6.2.3.1. SF personnel will not operate a vehicle in emergency (Code Three) status if it
       is occupied by any passengers other than SF. Exception: If SF are transporting injured
       personnel to a medical facility, use sound judgment when determining to use an
       emergency (Code 3) response. (T-1)
       A6.2.3.2. SF vehicles without emergency lights and siren will not make emergency
       (Code Three) responses. (T-1)
A6.3. Pursuit Driving. Pursuit driving is inherently dangerous and should be avoided except in
extreme situations. Examples of extreme situations include: pursuing a vehicle with material that
is extremely dangerous to others, such as nuclear, biological or chemical munitions or
components; pursuing a vehicle whose occupant(s) are suspects in an incident in which deadly
force would be authorized. In situations where deadly force would not be authorized and high
speed pursuit is not preferred, consider alternative courses of action, such as vehicle intercept
where SF strategically move their vehicles into a position to block or disable the suspect vehicle,
use of barrier system or Stop Sticks.
   A6.3.1. Safety. At no time will pursuit driving endanger the public, SF personnel involved in
   the pursuit or USAF resources. When engaged in a vehicle pursuit, SF personnel must weigh
   the need to immediately apprehend a suspect against the danger created by the pursuit.
   Extreme caution must be exercised to ensure public safety.
   A6.3.2. Responsibility. Responsibility for the decision to pursue an offender rests with each
   vehicle operator; however, on-duty SF supervisors can, at any time, order termination of any
   vehicle pursuit. Carefully evaluate each situation and consider the following factors:
       A6.3.2.1. Mission impact.
       A6.3.2.2. Local policy.
       A6.3.2.3. Danger to the public.
       A6.3.2.4. Danger to self and fellow patrols.
       A6.3.2.5. Experience and training.
       A6.3.2.6. Weather and road conditions.
       A6.3.2.7. Time of day (e.g., Is it rush hour? Has school just let out? Is it the middle of
       the night with deserted streets?)
       A6.3.2.8. Facilities located along the route (e.g., schools, hospital, shopping centers,
       etc.).
       A6.3.2.9. Type of violation--even if use of deadly force prerequisites are met, this does
       not mean SF may disregard the safety of the public, other SF personnel or self. SF may
       be held responsible for injuries or deaths if they act with reckless disregard for the safety
       of others.
       A6.3.2.10. Vehicle characteristics--use of emergency equipment is essential, so ensure
       vehicle operators turn on the siren and emergency lights. Use both throughout the pursuit.
       If vehicle is not equipped with emergency lights and siren, do not pursue.
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                            99


     A6.3.2.11. The warning effect of the siren will decrease rapidly as pursuit speed
     increases.
     A6.3.2.12. Use no more than two marked emergency vehicles in the immediate pursuit.
     Other SF vehicles will support the pursuit units without actively joining the pursuit. SF
     should also be positioned to block a suspect vehicle from threatening priority resources.
     (T-1)
     A6.3.2.13. Close installation gates to contain the suspect vehicle on base, unless closing
     the gates will cause a situation unnecessarily dangerous to the public. (T-3)
  A6.3.3. Radio and Driving Techniques. Use the radio sparingly and keep the frequency open
  for the desk sergeant and other units to assist. Where possible, use both hands on the steering
  wheel to maintain control. In the case of a two-person patrol, the rider conducts the radio
  communications. If two separate units are involved in the pursuit, the lead patrol concentrates
  on the suspect vehicle while the second patrol makes all radio transmissions concerning the
  pursuit. When transmitting, remain calm and speak clearly and coherently. Do not shout.
  When a pursuit begins, call the desk sergeant immediately and relay the following
  information:
     A6.3.3.1. Direction of travel.
     A6.3.3.2. Vehicle description and license number.
     A6.3.3.3. Number of occupants.
     A6.3.3.4. Exact reason for pursuit.
     A6.3.3.5. Traffic conditions and other details that will assist other patrols in the area.
  A6.3.4. Terminating a Pursuit. SF must use good judgment throughout a pursuit and
  continuously evaluate whether to terminate the pursuit. End a pursuit when the risks to
  bystanders, other traffic or the pursuing patrolman are unjustified. Supervisors are also
  responsible for monitoring the pursuit and must order its termination when the risk is not
  justifiable.

                   PRIVACY ACT STATEMENT FOR DNA SAMPLING

                                 PRIVACY ACT STATEMENT

This statement is provided in compliance with the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5
U.S.C. § 552a, which requires that Federal agencies inform individuals who are requested to
furnish personal information about themselves as to certain facts regarding the information
requested.

The collection of a sample of an individual’s deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) by the US
Department of Defense is authorized by and conducted pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 1565; 42 U.S.C.
§ 14135a et seq.; and 28 C.F.R. § 28.12. Collection is authorized for all offenses investigated
pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 14135a(a)(1)(A) and for all qualifying military offenses, as defined in 10
U.S.C. § 1565(d), including offenses which constitute a felony under the United States Code and
offenses for which a sentence of confinement for more than 1 year may be imposed under the
Uniform Code of Military Justice.

The purpose of the Department of Defense’s collection of a sample of an individual’s DNA is to
allow for positive identification and to provide or generate evidence to solve crimes through
database searches of potentially matching samples.

It is mandatory that United States persons who are arrested, facing charges or convicted and non-
United States persons, who are detained by the Department of Defense or Coast Guard in non-
combat or operational activities, cooperate in the collection of a sample of his or her DNA.
Failure to do so may result in samples taken by the minimum force necessary and/or result in
disciplinary action for a violation of Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice, or a
determination that the individual is guilty of a class A misdemeanor and punishment in
accordance with Title 18 (Crimes and Criminal Procedure), United States Code.

Analysis conducted on DNA samples collected by the Department of Defense will be forwarded
by the US Army Criminal Investigation Laboratory (USACIL) to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation for entry into the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS).

Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 14132(d) and 10 U.S.C. § 1565(e), an individual whose DNA is
collected and analyzed in the above manner may request that his or her DNA analysis be
expunged from USACIL records and CODIS if the individual is (i) not convicted of an offense in
a federal court, or in the case of a current or former service member, not convicted of an offense
by general or special courts-martial (including action generally inconsistent with such a
conviction, such as administration of non-judicial punishment, administrative separation or
referral to a summary court), and (ii) meets certain conditions set forth in DoD Instruction
5505.14, Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) Collection Requirements for Criminal Investigations.

MEMORANDUM FOR 11 ABW/CC/LG/XP IN TURN

FROM: 11 SFS/SFO/S5
      1223 Adam Street
      Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, Texas 78236-0119

SUBJECT: Crime Prevention Survey for Base Housing

1. ACTIVITY: A crime prevention survey was conducted on 816 Walnut Street to provide
housing management recommendations to enhance the security of base housing residents. The
primary reason to conduct this survey was a request by the 11th Air Base Wing/Commander.

2. DATE SURVEY CONDUCTED: 21 September 2011

3. PERSONNEL CONTACTED: Brit Weber/Base Housing Manager

4. PERSONNEL CONDUCTING SURVEY: TSgt William M. Smith, SFOP/S5, and TSgt
Henry Ford, CES/Safety Officer

5. SURVEY LOCATION: 816 Walnut Street, San Antonio, Texas 78234

6. ASSESSMENT: Base leadership requested new security/safety surveys be conducted of the
newly remodeled off-base housing to ensure measures have been established for base personnel
to begin residing in the homes. Observations and recommendations were noted and suggested
during the survey which will provide information to help improve security/safety standards
within individual units.

       Physical description of the property and unit: The home was built in the early 1940’s
       and has recently been remodeled. It is located on a .5 acre lot that shares a driveway with
       the adjoining property. The unit is a three story home with a basement. The first floor has
       five rooms, including full kitchen and one full bathroom; the second floor consists of
       three bedrooms and one full bathroom; and the third floor has two bedrooms with a large
       closet. The home’s foundation is constructed of concrete and the structure is built with
       pier-on-beam construction with hard board siding. The basement consists of five
       windows built with four inch thick glass cubes and one small screened window opening
       that does have proper locking mechanisms. The home has 15 windows which all have
       working locks. The two exterior doors located on the east and west are equipped with
       aluminum screen doors with working locks and hollow steal doors that have two locks on
       each. The basement has unfinished cement floors with exposed electric wiring and piping
       running along the ceiling and floor. The house has a wooden porch in the front and rear
       of the home. There is a small 15’X15’ detached shed located on the property located in
       the rear of home.
108                                                                  AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014


7. OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENTDATIONS:

      A. OBSERVATION / RECOMMENTDATION: The locking mechanisms on the door
      knobs and secondary deadbolts could be upgraded or a third type of lock placed on the
      front/back door of the home. The doors could be placed with the jam inside the home
      which would make it harder for the door to be kicked in.

      B. OBSERVATION / RECOMMENTDATION: All windows on the first floor are
      only protected with the inside locking mechanism. Bars could be added to increase the
      risk of an intruder to access the windows. The basement windows are built with just a
      small access window which makes it impossible for intruders to access.

      C. OBSERVATION/RECOMMENDATION: There is no current security system on
      the unit which should be installed and working before residents move in. The system
      should be installed on all doors/windows and also the ability for motion sensors to be
      utilized if resident requires this ability.

      D. OBSERVATION / RECOMMENDATION: The west entrance to the unit had one
      exterior light located on the front porch and the east entrance had one motion sensor light
      for the back porch and yard. The street was equipped with four telephone pole mounted
      street lamps. The north/south sides of the home were not lighted and should have some
      type of motion detection lights installed. The shed located in the back of the lot should
      also have a motion detection light installed to add additional light to the back to
      illuminate the area more adequately.

      E. OBSERVATION / RECOMMENDATION: On the north side of the house and back
      fence, vegetation was over grown and this increases areas for intruders to hide. Housing
      management office needs to ensure residents are conducting proper yard maintenance by
      trimming all trees/shrubbery surrounding the unit and fence line. On the west side, the
      large tree is growing into the power lines and a work order needs to be placed to have
      them trimmed to ensure the safety hazard is corrected.

      F. OBSERVATION / RECOMMENDATON: The fencing that is in place is adequate
      and establishes the property lines for the rear of the lot. A fence and vehicle gate should
      be installed for the west side (front) of home to increase the ability to enter the property
      and secure the lot and vehicles.

      G. OBSERVATION / RECOMMENDATION: The unit contains eight smoke/carbon
      monoxide detectors. The main floor contained zero detectors and should have at least one
      installed.

      H. OBSERVATION / RECOMMENDATION: The shed located in the rear of property
      does not have any locking mechanism to secure property and one should be installed
      before residents move in.
AFI31-118 5 MARCH 2014                                                                                         109


8. CLOSING: The 11 SFS/SFOP/S5 and 11 CES/Safety Officer conducted a Crime Prevention
security/safety survey to inform the installation commander and base leadership about current
and recommended security enhancements. The observations and recommendations of this survey
are meant to assist in preventing burglaries and thefts, as well as to enhance the overall security
and safety of base housing residents. Please direct any questions or comments concerning this
survey to TSgt William Smith at 210-925-1101 or william.smith.1@us.af.mil.
