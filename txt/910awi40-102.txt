1. General:
     1.1. The purpose of these procedures is to keep exposures to ionizing radiation as low as
     reasonably achievable (ALARA) and control exposures to laser radiation. The 910 AW
     command is committed to the program described herein for keeping individual and collective
     doses ALARA. In accordance with this commitment a qualified individual is designated in
     writing as the Base Radiation Safety Officer (RSO).
910AWI40-102 5 JUNE 2013                                                                        3


   1.2. The 910AW/SGPB office will conduct a formal annual review of the base/facility
   radiation safety program, including ALARA considerations. This will include reviews of
   operating procedures and past dose records, inspections, etc., and consultations with the
   radiation safety staff or outside consultants.
   1.3. Modifications to operating and maintenance procedures and to equipment and facilities
   will be made if they will reduce exposures unless the cost, in our judgment, is considered to
   be unjustified. 910AW/SGPB will be able to demonstrate, if necessary, that improvements
   have been sought, that modifications have been considered, and that they have been
   implemented when reasonable. If modifications have been recommended but not
   implemented, we will be prepared to describe the reasons for not implementing them.
   1.4. In addition to maintaining doses to individuals as far below the limits as is reasonably
   achievable; the sum of the doses received by all exposed individuals will also be maintained
   at the lowest practicable level. It would not be desirable, for example, to hold the highest
   doses to individuals to some fraction of the applicable limit if this involved exposing
   additional people and significantly increasing the sum of the radiation dose received by all
   involved individuals.
2. Responsibilities:
   2.1. Commander, 910AW (910AW/CC):
       2.1.1. The Commander, 910AW, has executive authority over the radiation safety
       program including activities conducted under USAF permits issued to base organizations.
       2.1.2. 910AW/CC shall appoint, in writing, a Base Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) and
       any alternate Radiation Safety Officers, necessary to manage the Radiation Safety
       Program. The title of Radiation Safety Officer is administrative only and does not
       necessarily denote a commissioned status.
       2.1.3. The base/facility commander shall be informed of any item of noncompliance with
       USNRC or United States Air Force (USAF) regulations. Any defect in facilities or
       equipment that may result in a substantial safety hazard, such as the loss of safety
       function, or incident where there is a major reduction in the degree of protection
       provided, shall be reported. Incidences where there is danger to public health and safety,
       IAW 10 Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) 21.3(k), and/or Air Force Occupational
       Safety Health Standards (AFOSH Std), or Air Force Instructions (AFIs) shall be reported
       immediately.
   2.2. The Radiation Safety Officer (RSO): The RSO is charged with ensuring all devices,
   which produce ionizing radiation, all radioactive materials, and all lasers are used safely and
   in compliance with USNRC criteria, USAF regulations, and USAF Radioactive Materials
   Permit conditions. The RSO may delegate routine administrative tasks to the Permit
   Radiation Safety Officer (PRSO) for oversight of permitted radioactive material use.
       2.2.1. The RSO is charged with the conduct of the base radiation safety program. The
       RSO is the individual designated by the Commander to investigate, evaluate, initiate
       corrective action, and report on defects or noncompliance items relating to substantial
       safety hazards involving radioactive materials, radiation producing devices, or lasers.
       The RSO has the authority to enforce Federal, Air Force, and base rules and regulations
 4                                                                  910AWI40-102 5 JUNE 2013


        relating to radiation safety. The RSO has the authority and responsibility to terminate
        any operation that poses a substantial radiation safety hazard except in those instances
        where such action could place the safety and well being of patients or others in greater
        danger than that posed by the radiation hazard.
        2.2.2. The RSO will report to the PRSO any occurrences or activities involving
        radioactive materials or pertaining to that organization's Radioactive Materials Permit
        that come to their attention.
     2.3. The Permit Radiation Safety Officer (PRSO): The PRSO is that individual appointed by
     the USAF Radioisotope Committee, and named on the Radioactive Materials Permit under
     the requirements of 10 CFR 35.900 who is responsible for the radiation safety duties.
     Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, 88th Air Base Wing, Environmental Management
     Radiation Safety office, holds this authority per the 910 Airlift Wing’s host tenant agreement.
     Assistant and alternate permit Radiation Safety officers may be approved and appointed as
     necessary to properly carry out these duties. Alternate PRSOs must meet all the appointment
     requirements of the PRSO.
     2.4. Authorized Users: "Authorized User" means those individuals who, by virtue of their
     formal training and/or experience, are identified as an authorized user of radioactive material
     (named on the Radioactive Materials Permit), radiation-producing devices, or lasers.
        2.4.1. New Uses. The authorized user will consult with the RSO, and the PRSO if
        applicable, during the planning stage for new uses to ensure that the use complies with
        regulatory requirements and the proper safety measures are utilized. New uses of
        radioactive materials, radiation producing devices, or lasers will not commence until they
        are reviewed and approved by the RSO.
        2.4.2. Supervision of Workers. The authorized user, with the assistance of the RSO, will
        explain required safety measures, the ALARA concept, and the need to maintain
        exposures ALARA to all supervised individuals and will ensure that these personnel are
        trained in good health physics practices and in methods to minimize exposures.
     2.5. Workers:
        2.5.1. Each individual involved with the use of radioactive materials, radiation producing
        devices, or lasers has a responsibility to comply with applicable USNRC and USAF
        regulations and permit conditions for the protection of their own health and safety and
        that of others. Each individual is also responsible for reporting promptly any violation of
        USNRC regulations, USAF regulations, permit conditions, or any defect in facilities or
        equipment that may affect health and safety. All workers who may potentially be
        occupationally exposed to radiation will follow ALARA principles and maintain
        exposures ALARA to the greatest extent possible.
        2.5.2. Women who work with ionizing radiation are responsible for informing
        supervisors of any possible pregnancy. This is discussed later in this regulation in
        Paragraph 9.1.
3. Posting Requirements:
     3.1. Copies of this regulation and the other cited Air Force regulations are maintained and
     available for review at the 910AW Bioenvironmental Engineering Office, Bldg. 218, YARS.
910AWI40-102 5 JUNE 2013                                                                     5


   Referenced sections of Title 10, Chapter I, Code of Federal Regulations and the Radioactive
   Materials Permit(s) are maintained and available for review. A copy of this regulation shall
   be available within the immediate area where activities involving the use of radioactive
   materials, radiation-producing devices, or lasers are conducted.
   3.2. The following items will also be posted in areas covered by a Radioactive Materials
   Permit in a location where workers are frequently present: an NRC Form 3, Notice to
   Employees, and a supplemental notice of permit and Air Force Master Materials License
   documentation availability in accordance with 10 CFR 19.11. The supplemental notice
   regarding availability of the Air Force Master Materials License and permits for review is
   given in AFI40-201, Managing Radioactive Material in the USAF.
4. Areas of Use:
   4.1. Registered generally licensed devices containing radioactive materials are routinely
   stored and used in 910 Civil Engineer Squadron (910 CES) Emergency Management (CEX);
   Base Fire Department (910CE/CEF), 910 Medical Squadron (910 MDS), Bioenvironmental
   Engineering and Environmental Health (910AW/SGPB), and 910 Security Forces Squadron
   (910SFS).
   4.2. X-Ray Radiation-producing equipment is routinely used in the 910MDS Dental Clinic,
   the 910 Maintenance Squadron (910MXS) Nondestructive Inspection (NDI) shielded
   exposure room, the 910 Communications Squadron (910CS) Mail room and the host tenant
   Navy/Marine Dental Office, Building 540. NDI x-ray machines may also be used in
   unshielded locations with the approval of the RSO.
5. Exposure Limits:
   5.1. Personnel who work with radioactive material or radiation producing devices may be
   exposed to radiation during the course of their employment. It is the goal of the radiation
   safety program to maintain all radiation exposures ALARA. It is important to understand the
   procedures used to monitor for radiation exposure and the significance of a radiation dose
   obtained during routine work activities.
   5.2. Federal regulations (10 CFR 20.1201 and 1207) specify the maximum permissible dose
   limits for radiation workers. The limits, in units of millirem (mrem) are listed below.

Table 1. Maximum Permissible Radiation Dosage Limits.
                   Annual Limit To:      Radiation Workers    Working Minors
                                              (mrem)             (mrem)

                   Total Body or        5,000                 500
                   Summation*           50,000                5,000

                      NOTE: The sum of the deep-dose equivalent and the
                      committed dose equivalent to any individual organ or tissue
                      other than the lens of the eye.



     5.3. In addition, 10 CFR, Part 20.1301, specifies that radiation levels are not permitted in
     unrestricted areas (i.e. areas accessible to the general public) which could cause an individual
     to receive doses in excess of the limits listed below:
        5.3.1. Any Year        100 mrem
        5.3.2. Any One Hour       2 mrem
        5.3.3. If integrated radiation levels could exceed these limits, the area must be restricted.
6. Personnel Dosimetry Procedures:
     6.1. Dosimeters are issued on an individual basis IAW AFMAN48-125, Personnel Ionizing
     Radiation Dosimetry, and may be obtained by contacting Bioenvironmental Engineering.
     The following guidelines are used:
        6.1.1. All individuals who are occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation on a regular
        basis and who, based on documented past exposures, may be exposed to radiation that
        may result in doses greater than 10% of the annual limit, will be enrolled in the USAF
        Personnel Dosimetry Program and issued a radiation dosimeter.
        6.1.2. Individuals occasionally exposed, but whose total dose is not expected to exceed
        10% of the limit, may be issued a whole body monitor when performing those duties, if
        in the judgment of the RSO such issue is desirable for any reason.
     6.2. Each supervisor who has personnel in the dosimetry program is responsible for assuring
     that the control dosimeter and any badges not in use are stored in a convenient low radiation
     area.
        6.2.1. The area supervisor is responsible for ensuring that all personnel working
        regularly in radiation areas who are entered into the dosimetry program wear their
        dosimeters correctly.
        6.2.2. Dosimetry results will be provided annually.
        6.2.3. When not in use, dosimeters must be stored in the designated area and not left
        attached to garments or stored in desk drawers. They are not to be taken home.
     6.3. Each month or quarter, a report of the exposures recorded on the dosimeters in
     published (RDL Listing 1499-1 and 1499-2). This report is reviewed by the RSO to
     determine if the exposures recorded are in compliance with the ALARA program. The
     results are then forwarded to area supervisors.
     6.4. Classification of radiation doses is accomplished according to the system described
     below. For doses less than Investigation level I, no action will be taken except when deemed
     appropriate by the RSO.
910AWI40-102 5 JUNE 2013                                                                          7


      6.4.1. Investigation Level I. The RSO will review the exposure and consider each such
      exposure in comparison with those of others performing similar tasks as an index of
      ALARA program quality and will record the review.

Table 2. Radiation Exposure I.
                                                      Dose (mrem/calendar quarter)

                                                      Greater than or equal to
                          Total effective dose
                          equivalent                                   125

                          Eye dose equivalent                          375

                          Skin or extremity
                          shallow dose equivalent                     1250

      6.4.2. Investigation Level II. The RSO will investigate the cause of the exposure and, if
      warranted, will take corrective action. A written report of the investigation and actions
      taken will be presented to the 910 AW/CC and /or Aerospace Medicine Council (AMC)
      for review.

                                                      Dose (mrem/calendar quarter)

                                                      Greater than or equal to
                          Total effective dose
                          equivalent                  375


                          Eye dose equivalent         1125

7. Procedures for Personnel Training:
   7.1. All personnel who are classified as occupational radiation workers will receive regular
   training on radiation safety. This training is to be specific for the work area. Immediate
   supervisors are responsible for ensuring that all personnel receive this training.
   7.2. The RSO will provide initial training for all personnel when they enter the dosimetry
   program and for any new employee working in or frequenting radiation areas. The RSO will
   document topics and attendance at all training sessions. The RSO is also responsible for
   providing training on an as-needed basis for any personnel who enters a restricted area.
   7.3. The RSO is responsible for providing annual training for emergency workers who may
   have cause to enter a restricted area (i.e., police, security, firefighters, medical, and command
   and control).
8. Procedures for Reporting Unsafe Conditions:
 8                                                                    910AWI40-102 5 JUNE 2013


     8.1. Any worker or representative of workers who believes that a violation of USNRC or
     USAF regulations or permit conditions has occurred, or that any defect in facilities or
     equipment exists which could cause unnecessary radiation exposure should report such
     conditions to:
     8.2. Reports by workers may initially be submitted verbally, but should be resubmitted in
     writing within five workdays for proper documentation. NOTE: Use of Personal Identifying
     Information, such as an employee/worker Date of Birth (DOB) or Social Security Number
     (SSN) on any report whatsoever, will automatically classify the report as For Official Use
     Only (FOUO), and require use of a protective coversheet, as well as the full protection of
     Title 5, U.S.C. 552a, the Privacy Act of 1974”
     8.3. Requests for inspection of violations or defects involving radioactive material possessed
     under authority of the USAF Radioactive Material Permit, may also be made directly, in
     writing, to the USAF Radioisotope Committee, the USAF Inspector General (IG), or the
     USNRC Office of Inspection and Enforcement, in accordance with 10 CFR 19.16(a).
     8.4. The RSO or a designated representative shall immediately inform the base commander
     of the alleged violation, safety defect, or hazard.
     8.5. The RSO or designated representative shall conduct an investigation to determine
     whether or not a substantial safety defect, hazard or noncompliance exists. The findings shall
     be reported in writing to the base commander and a copy shall be filed with the appropriate
     case file and USAF Permit if radioactive material is involved.
     8.6. For radioactive material; if a substantial safety defect, hazard or noncompliance does
     exist, corrective action shall be taken and notification shall be provided to the USAF
     Radioisotope Committee by the PRSO or a designated representative within two days of the
     determination. If initial notification is by telephone, a written report shall be submitted to the
     USAFR Radioisotope Committee within 5 days following the determination.
     8.7. All written reports and correspondence with the USAF Radioisotope Committee shall be
     submitted by the PRSO or a designated representative through RSO, Bioenvironmental
     Engineering, the medical facility commander, wing commander, and command headquarters,
     in turn.
9. Procedures for Fertile Females Receiving Occupational Exposure to Ionizing Radiation:
     9.1. Many military and civilian women are assigned by the Air Force to jobs requiring
     possible occupational exposure to ionizing radiation. The potential exposure in some of
     these jobs is so low that it is virtually impossible for individuals performing them to receive
     annual whole body exposures above the limits to which non-radiation workers may be
     exposed under present federal radiation protection guidance. Other jobs, however, may
     result in an individual routinely receiving measurable radiation doses above this limit. In
     these instances, concern must be given to protecting the unborn child, which is particularly
     sensitive to the effects of ionizing radiation.
     9.2. National exposure guidelines have been established by the National Council on
     Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) to minimize the risk to the unborn child.
     These guidelines recommend that the total dose to the child during pregnancy be kept as low
     as reasonably achievable but should never exceed 500 mrem. The USNRC has made these
910AWI40-102 5 JUNE 2013                                                                      9


  guidelines part of their regulatory requirements in 10 CFR 20.1208. In keeping with the
  NCRP recommendations and USNRC regulations, the Air Force policy for Occupational
  Exposure of Fertile Females to Ionizing Radiation is specified in AFMSC/SGPA policy
  letters dated 4 August 1983 and 21 November 1983. This policy is summarized below:
     9.2.1. Each female who may be occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation shall be
     informed by the RSO of the USAF policy as well as the recommendations of the NCRP
     to limit radiation exposure during pregnancy and the importance of immediately
     notifying her supervisor if she suspects she is pregnant. The individual will be given the
     opportunity to ask questions and will be required to acknowledge in writing that she has
     been advised of this policy. Documentation will be maintained.
     9.2.2. A female who is occupationally exposed to radiation is responsible for controlling
     exposures to the fetus/embryo. She must declare, in writing by filling out the Declaration
     of Pregnancy (attachment 4), to both her immediate supervisor and the base RSO, her
     pregnancy and must include an estimated date of conception. The RSO will then
     evaluate the individual’s specific duties involving exposure to radiation. This evaluation
     will include consideration of the workplace and the source of radiation, the individual's
     history of exposure to radiation as documented by personnel dosimetry records, current
     radiation measurements applicable to her specific tasks, current exposure histories of
     coworkers, and likely exposures that would be incurred in the event of a credible
     accident.
     9.2.3. If the RSO determines it is unlikely that the female would receive a total exposure
     during the term of the pregnancy (including the period preceding the confirmation of the
     pregnancy) in excess of 500 mrem, she may continue in her radiation related duties. If
     the individual is not already on the AF personnel dosimetry program, she will be enrolled
     for the duration of her pregnancy. Arrangements will be made with USAFR AL/OEBD
     to receive, in addition to the laboratory's routine written report, message notification of
     the individual's dosimetry results as soon as the laboratory processes each dosimeter.
     Should exposure results indicate a trend which, if continued, could result in exceeding the
     500 mrem annual limit, or should she receive more than 50 mrem in any month after her
     pregnancy is declared, a reevaluation will be made as to whether she should continue her
     radiation duties, be restricted from certain high risk duties, or be removed entirely from
     occupational exposure. (See Attachment 4)
     9.2.4. Special consideration must be made when a pregnant worker's radiation duties
     involve the operation of high output sources or the use of unsealed radioactive materials.
     Pregnant workers shall not continue in duties involving these sources without specific
     approval of HQ AFMOA/SGPR. When a pregnancy is reported to the immediate
     supervisor, women working with such sources or materials will receive a prompt
     evaluation, and, if warranted, action may be taken prior to confirmation of the pregnancy.
     9.2.5. A pregnant female is afforded special monitoring, protection limits, and duty
     restrictions only when she declares herself to be pregnant in writing. If the pregnant
     female does not wish this special status, she may declare this wish in writing and will,
     from this point on, be covered by the dose limits for the non-pregnant radiation worker
     with no special fetal monitoring or restrictions in duties.
 10                                                              910AWI40-102 5 JUNE 2013


      9.2.6. A female also has the authority, at any time, to undeclare a pregnancy. This must
      also be in writing to their immediate supervisor and the RSO.
10. Requests for Radioactive Materials, Radiation Producing Devices, and Facility
Modifications:
   10.1. All requests for new radioactive materials, new uses of radioactive materials, or
   changes in the area of use of radioactive materials must be approved by the RSO prior to the
   material being ordered or the change taking place. Approval may be requested by
   forwarding a letter to the RSO which states the intended use of the new material or a
   description of the change in use, the radionuclide involved, the form of the radionuclide, the
   activity, the name of the supplier, and the location of the proposed area of use.
   10.2. All requests for new radiation producing devices, or modifications to existing radiation
   producing devices or facilities, must be approved by the RSO prior to the device being
   ordered and the change taking place. Approval may be requested by forwarding a letter to
   the RSO stating the intended use of the new device or a description of the proposed
   modification of device, the location where the device will be used, and the name of the
   manufacturer.
   10.3. All facility modifications taking place in an area where radioactive materials or
   radiation producing devices are currently used must be reviewed and approved by the RSO
   prior to the modification taking place. All facility modification necessary to accommodate
   new uses of radioactive materials or radiation producing devices must be approved by the
   RSO prior to the work taking place. Approval may be requested by forwarding a letter to the
   RSO that thoroughly describes the intended modification. The requester and the RSO will
   ensure that this approval has been received prior to work commencing.
11. Receiving Radioactive Material and Radiation Producing Devices:
   11.1. Each section that expects to receive radioactive materials on a recurring basis must
   prepare an operating instruction which addresses their procedures in detail. If requested, the
   RSO will provide assistance in preparing these instructions. When completed, this operating
   instruction must be submitted to and approved by the permit RSO.
   11.2. Sections that receive radioactive materials infrequently (e.g., once per year or longer)
   must coordinate receiving procedures with the RSO prior to the arrival of the material.
      11.2.1. On notification that the item has arrived, the RSO will inspect and monitor the
      package or merely request notification when the package is delivered to the user. Only
      the RSO or the user shall open the package. The action taken will depend on the hazard
      associated with the particular item and the condition of the package.
      11.2.2. After the package is opened by the user and the contents examined, the RSO will
      be notified immediately if there is either a discrepancy between the item(s) ordered and
      received or if the item(s) appear damaged. If all items are as ordered and in acceptable
      condition, the RSO will be notified in writing of the receipt (copies of shipping
      documents should be included).
   11.3. Special precautions must be taken by the permittee when receiving and opening
   packages that contain radioactive material:
      11.3.1. Visually inspect the package and, if damaged, notify the RSO immediately.
910AWI40-102 5 JUNE 2013                                                                       11


      11.3.2. Measure the exposure rate and, if greater than expected, contact the RSO.
      11.3.3. Wear gloves if the package contains liquids and is to be opened.
      11.3.4. Verify the contents with the packing slip.
      11.3.5. Examine the integrity of the final source container.
      11.3.6. If anything unusual is encountered contact the RSO.
      11.3.7. As specified in 10 CFR 20.1906, packages containing in excess of certain
      specified quantities of radioactive material must be monitored for external radiation and
      contamination within 3 hours after receipt during working hours and within 18 hours if
      received after working hours.
   11.4. The RSO must be kept informed of delivery and installation schedules for new
   radiation producing devices. Prior to the operation of these devices the RSO must
   accomplish a radiation survey of the device to ensure that all required radiation safety
   requirements have been met.
12. Procedures for Recycling and/or Waste Disposal:
   12.1. Each organization that may generate radioactive waste during the course of its
   operation(s) will assume full responsibility for collection, packaging, storage, recycling
   and/or disposal of radioactive waste generated. If accomplished properly, the potential for
   contamination of the environment or subjecting personnel to unnecessary radiation risks, will
   be eliminated. Since there will be no central radioactive waste storage location, each
   organization will provide a secure, isolated area for temporary storage of its own waste, on-
   site, near the location where it is generated. Each site will be approved by the RSO. When a
   container is filled and ready for recycling or disposal, the RSO will be notified in writing.
   The RSO will make arrangements for shipment/delivery to 88 Air Base Wing
   (88ABW)/CEV, Wright-Patterson AFB, Fairborne, Ohio, for recycling or disposal. The
   generator will NOT make contracts for pickup, recycling or disposal of radioactive waste.
   12.2. Management of Radioactive Waste. To ensure safe handling of radioactive waste,
   specific procedures must be established by the RSO. Any proposed deviations from these
   procedures must be submitted in writing to the RSO and approval must be obtained prior to
   implementation of the alternative procedures.
13. Emergency Procedures and Reporting Requirements:
   13.1. Spills of radioactive material. A spill is not limited to liquids. Release of radioactive
   material from its container, regardless of the form of the material, is considered a spill. The
   materials may be in powdered form, liquid, gas, or a solid mass. Spills pose a hazard
   because of the potential for: (1) contamination of the environment, (2) contamination of the
   skin of personnel, (3) ingestion or inhalation of radioactive material, and (4) production of a
   high radiation field that may result in a radiation dose exceeding permissible limits even if
   the individual does not become externally contaminated. A spill may result from a simple
   incident such as the dropping of a container or it may result from a more serious event such
   as a fire or explosion.
   13.2. Production of a radiation field by an X-ray machine, irradiator, accelerator or
   radioactive material (even if the material is completely contained). An X-ray machine,
12                                                               910AWI40-102 5 JUNE 2013


  radioisotope irradiator, or accelerator may be emitting radiation when it is supposed to be off.
  For example, a unit may be shut down; however, if a switch or circuit malfunctions and the
  unit does not power down, it may still emit radiation into an area. Radiation releases by
  human error may also occur. For example, an accelerator beam is deflected into the wrong
  experimental area. In such an instance, individuals may be exposed to high radiation fields
  possibly without their knowledge.
  13.3. Response Procedures:
     13.3.1. Differences in response to the two situations described above include:
         13.3.1.1. For spills, the material must be confined to prevent further contamination
         and individuals/environment must be decontaminated.
         13.3.1.2. For radiation fields, individuals must be removed from the radiation field or
         the radiation source must be interrupted (e.g., turning off the X-ray machine or
         shielding the source).
         13.3.1.3. For both cases, the primary concern is the protection of individuals in the
         vicinity, including emergency response personnel; and second, the protection of the
         environment. Life saving activities always takes priority over other considerations.
         In fact, relatively large personnel exposures may be permitted for life saving
         procedures. This is, however, a one-time permissible exposure that can never be
         repeated. Essential first aid always takes precedence over decontamination.
     13.3.2. Emergency procedures are divided into two categories:
         13.3.2.1. The first category involves generic response procedures, that is, procedures
         applicable to most situations.
         13.3.2.2. The second category involves a site-specific response procedure that is
         procedure unique to a specific location or situation.
     13.3.3. This regulation describes typical generic response procedures. The user develops
     site-specific procedures. Copies of both generic and site-specific emergency response
     procedures are maintained by the RSO and are made available to emergency response
     teams such as the Fire Department, Security Force and Emergency Management. The
     RSO will either direct or delegate responsibility for all radioactive material cleanup
     operations.
     13.3.4. Generic Emergency Response Procedures:
         13.3.4.1. Spills. An acronym used to assist in recalling spill control procedures is
         “SWIMS” which stands for:
910AWI40-102 5 JUNE 2013                                                                     13


Table 4. SWIMS.
                   Stop the spill
                   Warn others
                   Isolate the area
                   Minimize the exposure
                   Secure unfiltered exhaust
The following guidance is provided (minimum
steps):
              13.3.4.1.1. Prepare for a spill by having a "spill kit" readily available complete
              with all of the items required to respond.
              13.3.4.1.2. Advise all personnel not directly involved with the initial spill
              incident or the subsequent cleanup to evacuate the area. Anyone suspected of
              being contaminated during the incident or cleanup should not leave the area until
              monitored and decontaminated if necessary.
              13.3.4.1.3. One individual should assume responsibility for immediate actions.
              This is not the time to argue protocol or seniority. Just as for Cardio Pulmonary
              Resuscitation (CPR) where the individual who starts CPR is in charge until he or
              she relinquishes control, such is the same action during a spill, where the
              individual who starts giving commands should continue to do so until a more
              qualified and knowledgeable individual arrives on scene.
              13.3.4.1.4. Stop the spill if possible, without personal endangerment. This may
              involve turning a container right side up, capping it or throwing some material
              over the source to absorb or stifle the emissions. In either case, the benefit of
              performing this activity (e.g., preventing contamination from spreading to
              uncontrolled areas) must be balanced by the risk to the individual performing it
              (e.g., contamination, inhalation, or exposure of the individual). If all of the
              contents have escaped from the container, don't waste time capping it.
              13.3.4.1.5. Warn individuals not involved in the spill to evacuate the area.
              Designate someone to call for assistance. Call the RSO and others, such as the
              supervisor, radiation monitor, or emergency response teams (e.g., fire department
              or ambulances) as required. The RSO will ensure that all notifications required
              by AFI 40-201 and 10 CFR 20.403 and 20.405, are accomplished.
              13.3.4.1.6. Determine extent of the spill. If liquid or solid, try to mark
              boundaries. If gas, determine which areas are affected.
              13.3.4.1.7. Secure unfiltered exhaust and any other pathways outside the area
              (e.g., air vents, windows, drains, etc.).
              13.3.4.1.8. Don protective equipment such as gloves, boots, anti-contamination
              clothing (anti-Cs), and respirators. Minimize the number of personnel involved.
              Protective gear such as self contained breathing apparatus (SCBAs) and bunker
              suits used by fire fighters will normally provide sufficient protection from
              contamination although monitoring should be accomplished prior to removing
              such equipment to prevent inadvertent contamination.
14                                                              910AWI40-102 5 JUNE 2013


            13.3.4.1.9. Measure radiation levels. Use meters, air samplers, etc.
            13.3.4.1.10. Monitor all personnel. Obtain all information necessary to perform
            follow-up evaluations on personnel (e.g., name, address, phone numbers, Social
            Security Account Number (SSAN), location at scene, duration of exposure, etc.).
            Check individuals for external contamination. If clothing is contaminated,
            remove it. If skin is contaminated, shower or wash, depending on available
            facilities. Although contamination should not be permitted to enter the sanitary
            system, personnel decontamination takes priority. Consider the need for internal
            evaluation (i.e., bioassay sampling such as urine, feces, nasal swabs, etc.).
            Bioassay samples are best collected immediately (provided external
            contamination of the sample is not a problem) and again after 24 hours. The RSO
            will provide guidance on follow-up sampling intervals:
            13.3.4.1.11. Monitor environment and surfaces. Clean up if contaminated and
            collect all waste in plastic bags and place in sturdy containers.
            13.3.4.1.12. For fires, water should be used sparingly since it may tend to spread
            contamination.
            13.3.4.1.13. Radioactive material not involved in the incident should not be
            moved. Transporting sources to an alternate storage location during an incident to
            safeguard them is not recommended. Such actions tend to increase the possibility
            of personnel exposure or contamination due to accidental spills in transit. It is
            also possible that such actions could cause a loss of control over the sources.
            Under normal circumstances, the location of most sources will be known in
            advance and measures can be taken to deal with them. However, if an attempt is
            made to move sources, the attempt may not be successful and response personnel
            might not then be aware of their new location. This could pose a greater hazard
            than initially existed.
            13.3.4.1.14. After the cleanup has been completed, a report of the incident will be
            prepared as directed by the RSO and a copy submitted to the wing commander.
     13.3.5. Radiation Fields. Accidents involving potential exposure to radiation fields are
     easier to deal with than spills although no less hazardous. The following procedures are
     recommended:
        13.3.5.1. Shut down the source. For an X-ray unit this may involve interrupting the
        electrical supply either at the unit or at a main panel. For a radioisotope irradiator
        containing radioactive material it may be necessary to shield the source. In some
        cases it may not be possible to stop the radiation.
        13.3.5.2. One individual should assume responsibility for immediate actions.
        13.3.5.3. Warn others of the problem and send for assistance from the RSO and
        others.
        13.3.5.4. Isolate the area by closing doors or setting up improvised barriers to prevent
        entry. Be certain that no one is in the area before securing it.
        13.3.5.5. After the situation has been corrected, a report of the incident will be
        prepared as directed by the RSO.
910AWI40-102 5 JUNE 2013                                                                    15


      13.3.6. Emergency Response Teams:
          13.3.6.1. The RSO will assist with establishing initial training and annual refresher
          training to all personnel who may be called on to respond to accidents/involving
          radioactive material or radiation-producing devices if an Emergency Response Team
          (ERT) is formed.
          13.3.6.2. Supervisors will be responsible for informing the RSO of newly assigned
          personnel to permit scheduling of initial training.
          13.3.6.3. A listing of locations where radioactive material or radiation-producing
          devices are stored or used, a summary of the sources located in each area and a copy
          of the site-specific emergency procedures provided by the organization possessing the
          sources will be made available to each emergency response team.
14. Laser Hazard Control Program:
   14.1. Information is designed to supplement the information contained in AFOSH Standard
   (AFOSHS) 48-139, LASER and Optical Radiation Protection Program.
      14.1.1. All people responsible for procurement, operation and/or maintenance of LASER
      systems must be familiar with the requirements of AFOSHS48-139 and the requirements
      of this regulation.
   14.2. Responsibilities:
      14.2.1. Commanders, in addition to the requirements of AFOSHS48-139, will ensure
      that the RSO is notified of all people being assigned to or being removed from a position
      where exposure to LASER radiation is possible.
      14.2.2. The RSO will accomplish all actions required by AFOSHS 48-139 as well as
      keeping a current inventory of all LASER systems on base.
      14.2.3. Unit safety officers will periodically check LASER fitted devices and areas for
      labeling and posting requirements. Discrepancies are identified to the RSO.
      14.2.4. LASER users will be familiar with requirements of AFOSHS48-139 and this
      regulation.
      14.2.5. Occupational Health Office will administer/schedule physical examinations
      required by AFOSHS48-139.
      14.2.6. Contract administrators will ensure contractors conform to AF and base safety
      and physical exam requirements.
   14.3. Base LASER Program. All requests to order LASER-producing devices must be
   routed through the RSO for approval. Before operating any LASER on base, the device must
   be added to the inventory, classified, and the proposed operation reviewed by the RSO. Use
   of any LASER without these steps being completed will be immediately terminated by the
   RSO.
      14.3.1. Inventory. The RSO must keep a current inventory of all LASERs on base and
      those operated by base people at other locations. This inventory is the basis of the
      LASER Hazards Control Program. The user must tell the RSO when new systems are
16                                                            910AWI40-102 5 JUNE 2013


     installed, current systems are modified, current systems are moved from one location to
     another, or usage is terminated.
     14.3.2. Classification.   Each LASER is assigned a classification according to
     AFOSHS48-139. The user must forward the operating parameters listed in Attachment 1
     to the RSO so that a classification may be assigned. Special arrangements can be made
     for classified LASER parameters. Call the RSO for information.
     14.3.3. Labeling. All LASERs must have an American National Standard Institute
     (ANSI) hazard classification label prominently displayed. Manufacturer's labels may be
     supplemented to provide the required information.
     14.3.4. Warning Signs. Warning signs and beacons, if required by AFOSHS48-139, are
     positioned with the help of the RSO and base safety representatives.
     14.3.5. Hazard Evaluations. Hazard evaluations are performed on all installations
     utilizing LASER systems. This is accomplished by the RSO to determine specific
     hazards of the LASER system in combination with the surrounding areas. (See the
     information in Attachment 2 to make a hazard evaluation).
        14.3.5.1. The RSO will conduct a LASER Hazard Evaluation to determine the
        Nominal Ocular Hazard Zone (NOHZ) associated with the LASER and the ocular
        density (OD) of any protective eyewear required.
        14.3.5.2. Movement of a LASER for storage or use in a new location requires RSO
        notification and a new survey to be conducted.
        14.3.5.3. The RSO will survey the area to ensure all safety precautions, including
        labeling and posting, requirements are met.
        14.3.5.4. The RSO will conduct periodic surveys of LASER work areas to ensure
        continued safe operation of the system.
        14.3.5.5. The RSO may direct the appropriate commander to terminate any LASER
        use that does not meet the requirements of this regulation or AFOSHS48-139.
        14.3.5.6. In certain situations, the indoor or outdoor use of LASERs may require
        evaluation according to AFR19-2, Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EAIP).
        The operators of all such lasers must ensure that they comply with this regulation.
  14.4. Medical Examinations:
     14.4.1. Newly Assigned LASER Duties. All people newly assigned to ANSI Class 3b or
     4 LASER duties must have an eye examination before assignment to these duties. These
     examinations are scheduled with an ophthalmologist or an optometrist.          The unit
     supervisor must identify the personnel that will be using the LASER(s) to the
     Occupational Health Office to ensure that personnel are receiving their pre and post eye
     examinations.
     14.4.2. Termination of LASER duties. Upon termination of Class 3b or 4 LASER duties
     (PCS/PCA, retirement, separation, or assignment to duties that no longer involve
     LASERs), the individual must have a termination examination. This examination should
     be as soon as practical following termination of LASER duties. This requirement should
     be included in unit clearance actions.
