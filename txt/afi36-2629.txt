                                           Chapter 1

                        GENERAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

1.1. The Individual Reserve Program is composed of four categories of Individual
Reservists: the IMA; the PIRR; non-participating Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) and the
Standby Reserve. This instruction addresses the IMA and PIRR, not the entire Individual
Reserve Program, as further delineated in paragraphs 1.1.1. and 1.1.2.
     1.1.1. The Air Reserve Personnel Center (ARPC) maintains administrative control
     (ADCON) for the Standby Reserve and the non-participating Individual Ready Reserve.
     1.1.2. The RMG exercise ADCON of assigned IMA and PIRR personnel, hereafter referred
     as IRs. IMAs are members of the Selected Reserve (SelRES) and assigned to training and
     retired category designator (TRC) ―B‖. PIRR are assigned to TRC ―E‖. Program Action
     Directive (PAD) 97-09, Reassignment of Forces to AFRC, directed the reassignment of all
     forces of the Air Force Reserve, to include IR, except those assigned to US South Command
     (USSOCOM), to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC). Regular component organizations
     exercise specified ADCON of assigned or attached IRs further delineated in paragraph 2.24.
     ADCON of non-mobilized IRs is exercised by the AFRC commander through the RMG
     commander, who is, in turn, responsible to the Secretary of the Air Force.
        1.1.2.1. IMAs authorizations are individual military Air Force Reserve assets functioning
        as a total-force multiplier to augment the Air Force in war, contingency operations, and
        peacetime to meet National Defense, strategic national interest, and domestic objectives.
        IMAs are assigned against validated and funded positions on the regular duty component
        manning document. Requirements are established IAW AFI 38-201, Chapter 9,
        Management of Manpower Requirements and Authorizations and AFI 38-204, Chapter 3,
        Programming USAF Manpower.
        1.1.2.2. The PIRR consists of those Ready Reservists who are not in the SelRES and are
        in a non-pay training program. Members in this category are attached to an active duty or
        Reserve unit. The PIRR is normally for members who have lost a Selected Reserve
        position through no fault of their own and/or cannot secure a SelRES position due to lack
        of vacancies. PIRR encompasses Admissions Liaison Officers (ALO), Civil Air Patrol
        (CAP) and Ready Reinforcement Personnel Section (RRPS).
1.2. Reserve training and retirement categories (TRCs) for both IMAs and PIRRs are described
in DoDI 1215.06, Uniform Reserve, Training and Retirement Categories. The primary purpose
of all training is the enhancement of individual skill and unit effectiveness.
1.3. Guidance on assignment to IMA positions and attachment to the PIRR are detailed in AFI
36-2115, Assignments Within the Reserve Components.
1.4. Specific participation requirements for the IR are incorporated in AFI 36-2254, Volume 1,
Reserve Personnel Participation.
1.5. Per PAD 97-09 when Air Reserve Component (ARC) unit forces are mobilized, Operational
Control (OPCON) of those forces transfers in accordance with Secretary of Defense (SecDef)
orders.The Commander of Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) receives specified ADCON over all
attached forces. Short of full mobilization, ADCON (other than specified ADCON) remains with
AFRC, unless a specific agreement is made to integrate the ARC and regular components.
