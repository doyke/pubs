survive and operate in areas where Air Force personnel may encounter chemical-biological
agents.
1.6.1. Chemical-Biological High Threat Area: Geographical area where Air Force personnel,
through training, equipping, and deliberate planning, must maintain a high level of readiness.
1.6.2. Chemical-Biological Medium Threat Area: Geographical area where Air Force

of readiness. Units must be prepared to assume a higher state of readiness or support
deployments to a high chemical-biological threat area.
1.6.3. Chemical-Biological Low Threat Area: Geographical area where Air Force personnel,

biological or chemical agents on or by structures, areas, personnel, or objects.
1.8. Fit Factor: The measure of the quality of the gas mask face seal calculated using the

substance inside the gas mask cavity. The Air Force fit factor requirement is 2000.
1.9. Quantitative Fit Test: A test to determine the gas mask fit factor.
1.10. Hard-To-Fit Program: A program developed to identify Air Force personnel not passing
the quantitative fit test by achieving an adequate fit factor with the MCU-2 series gas mask.
1.11. M45 Mask: Land Warrior gas mask worn by Air Force personnel unable to achieve an
adequate fit factor with the MCU-2 series gas mask and identified as Hard-To-Fit.
