                               AIRFIELD ENVIRONMENT

1.1. Hours of Operation and Staffing. Andersen Tower and Airfield Management Operations
(AMOPS) is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Exceptions will be distributed via NOTAM
(PGUA).
   1.1.1. Optimal AMOPS manning is one 1C771 and one 1C751, with minimum manning
   being two qualified 1C751s. In both cases, at least one will be a qualified Airfield
   Management Operations Supervisor or a qualified Airfield Management Shift Lead. One
   1C731, who has completed all upgrade/qualification training requirements and is only
   awaiting time requirements as outline in AFI 36-2201 for the award of the 5-skill level, may
   substitute for only one 1C751 per shift.
   1.1.2. The control tower utilizes a senior controller concept IAW AFI 13-204, Vol 3. During
   local wing flying a watch supervisor concept will be utilized IAW OSAT OI 13-203.
      1.1.2.1. Wing (local) Flying. Defined as four or more base assigned aircraft operating in
      the Andersen local flying area. The local flying area is defined in para 2.1.
1.2. Runway Description. Andersen AFB has two AF Class B concrete parallel runways,
06R/24L and 06L/24R. There is 1,800 feet between centerlines and both runways are 200 feet
wide (Attachment 2). Runway 06R/24L is a Category I instrument runway and is also
designated as the primary instrument runway. Weight bearing capacity can be found in the
PACAF IFR supplement or from Airfield Management Operations.
   1.2.1. Runway lengths are as follows:

Table 1.1. Arrivals
      RUNWAY LENGTH OVERRUN
      06L/24R 10,535  1,030’
      06R/24L 11,204’ 1,030’
      1.2.1.1. The 1018’ of pavement prior to the RWY 06R and 1065’of pavement prior to
      RWY 06L threshold is considered the pre-threshold Take-off Run Area (TORA) and is
      available for takeoff when necessary for mission accomplishment.
   1.2.2. The runways at Andersen have a down slope that change to an upslope. Runway
   gradients are as follows:

Table 1.2. Runway Gradients
      06R (normal entry)    .51% up         06L (normal entry)    .77% up
      06R (overrun entry)   .36% up         06L (overrun entry)   .71% up
      24L (normal entry)    .43% down       24R (normal entry)    .77% down
 10                                                              36WGI13-204 22 JULY 2011


1.3. Arresting Systems. BAK-12 arresting gear is located 1,610 feet from the displaced
threshold of Runway 06R, 1,794 feet from the landing threshold of Runway 24L, 1,565 feet from
the displaced threshold of Runway 06L, and 1,790 feet from the displaced threshold of Runway
24R (Attachment 2).
   1.3.1. AMOPS, with concurrence of the Tower Watch Supervisor, is responsible for
   directing changes in configuration of the BAK-12 arresting system and will ensure that the
   cables are set for operational requirements. AMOPS will notify Barrier Maintenance at 366-
   5203 when an arresting system reconfiguration change is required.
   1.3.2. Normal configuration: departure ends cables raised on both runways for the runway in
   use, and the approach end of 06L/24R as applicable. Barrier Maintenance is responsible for
   advising AMOPS and Tower of any change in barrier status.
   1.3.3. When notified by AMOPS, Barrier Maintenance will ensure the cables are positioned
   as required (if not already). Minimum response time is 30 minutes during normal duty hours,
   and 45 minutes during non-duty hours. A 90-minute interval shall be applied to subsequent
   aircraft for planned successive engagements, in order to complete the T.O. checklist. If an
   emergency should arise requiring an unplanned successive engagement, 15 minutes
   minimum is required to reset the barrier.
   1.3.4. During a known engagement, Barrier Maintenance will stand by with equipment to
   facilitate prompt removal of the aircraft from the BAK-12 and timely restoration of the
   system. After aircraft disengagement, Barrier Maintenance will inform AMOPS and Tower
   when the barrier is reconfigured and rigged for operations.
   1.3.5. Use the terms ―operational‖ and ―not operational,‖ and whether the cable is ―raised‖
   or ―lowered, laid to the side‖ when reporting status to ATC and AMOPS.
1.4. Taxiway/Taxilane Description. Taxiways/taxilanes are identified by the letters A through
K (see Attachments 2 and 3). All taxiways are a minimum of 75 feet wide, with the following
exceptions: Taxiway F south of Runway 06R has a 200 foot warm-up pad on the East side,
adjacent to the runway. Taxiway/Taxilane boundary markings are marked at 143 feet from
taxiway centerlines to correspond with Andersen’s largest wingspan aircraft assigned the B-52.
Taxiway/Taxilane and Apron weight bearing restrictions are published in Area Planning or can
be obtained from AMOPS.
1.5. Parking Locations.
   1.5.1. For normal aircraft parking locations, see Attachment 3.
         1.5.1.1. Distinguished Visitor parking on South Ramp 3: The taxi line to the South
         Ramp 3 Distinguished Visitor parking spot is designed for aircraft with wingspan of 130
         feet and below. All other aircraft will use "Follow Me" truck to parking spot.
      1.5.2. For dangerous and hazardous cargo parking, see paragraph 7.3 and Attachment 2.
1.6. Controlled Movement Area (CMA): Controlled Movement Areas are airfield areas that
require Control Tower approval and CMA driving qualification IAW 36WGI 13-213, Andersen
AFB Airfield Driving, Chap 2 prior to entering. While in a CMA two-way radio contact with the
Control Tower is mandatory. The area includes both runways (06L/24R and 06R/24L), the
overruns, and 100 feet around the runway/overruns as defined by the runway hold lines. The
CMA also includes the Precision Approach Critical Areas (para.1.6.1) when accessed from non-
36WGI13-204 22 JULY 2011                                                                          11


ILS stoplight points and from non-controlled movement areas. Vehicles that transit through the
ILS Critical Areas controlled by the ILS stoplights can proceed through without delay when the
stoplight is green and do not need control tower approval or two-way radio contact with the
control tower. When the stoplight is red, vehicles will not enter the ILS Critical Areas
(Attachment 2) unless approved by and possess two-way radio contact with the control tower.
   1.6.1. Precision Approach Critical Areas. Due to the chance of interference with the ILS
   signal and to protect aircraft executing instrument approaches during inclement weather
   conditions there are several areas on the airfield that require special consideration.
       1.6.1.1. Glideslope critical area. A fan-shaped area that extends from the glideslope
       antenna 1,300 feet toward the approach end of the runway (or to the end of the runway,
       whichever is greater). It covers an area 30 degrees each side of a line drawn through the
       glideslope antenna and parallel to the runway centerline. Attachment 2
       1.6.1.2. Localizer critical area. A rectangular area parallel and perpendicular to the
       antenna array extending from the antenna array 2,000 feet towards the approach end of
       the runway and 200 feet on each side of the centerline of the approach course. It includes
       a 50-foot extension behind the antenna. Attachment 2
       1.6.1.3. Precision Obstacle Free Zone (POFZ). The POFZ area is a 800 foot wide by 200
       foot long rectangular area centered on the runway centerline, beginning at and extending
       outward from the runway threshold. Attachment 2
   1.6.2. Protection of the Precision Approach Critical Areas. Whenever an aircraft executing
   an ILS approach is inside the final approach fix (FAF), with a reported ceiling less than 800
   feet and/or visibility less than 2 miles, Tower will restrict all taxiing aircraft from proceeding
   beyond the instrument hold lines using the following phraseology: ―HOLD SHORT OF
   RUNWAY 06/24 L/R ILS CRITICAL AREA.” Tower will turn the traffic control light to red
   to stop traffic as soon as the aircraft reaches 15 mile final, but not later than 10 mile final.
   Vehicles will not precede past the instrument hold lines unless approved by and maintain
   two-way radio communications with the control tower. The light will stay on until the
   aircraft has completed its approach.
       1.6.2.1. In the event that either of the vehicle stop lights is inoperative the following
       procedures will be used IAW FAAO 7110.65, 3-7-5, and AFI 13-204, paragraph 7.23
       When the weather is less than 800’ ceiling and/or visibility less than 2 miles the ILS
       critical area will be protected.
       1.6.2.2. Due to a recent change requiring protection of the POFZ, Precision Approach
       Critical Area protection procedures do not provide adequate protection of the POFZ on
       three areas of the airfield. To protect these areas until appropriate airfield markings and
       signage are in place the following procedures will be followed when the reported ceiling
       is less than 800 foot and/or visibility less than 2 miles.
          1.6.2.2.1. When the reported ceiling is less than 800 foot and/or visibility less than 2
          miles the Tower will activate ILS Critical Area lights and notify AMOPS who will
          publish a NOTAM closing Taxiway Foxtrot and place lighted barricades at Taxiway
          Foxtrot/Bravo, Foxtrot/Charlie, Foxtrot/Delta and Foxtrot/vehicle access road
          preventing aircraft/vehicles from entering POFZ areas. Additionally, to protect the
          POFZ area located on Taxiway Kilo North of 06R/24L all aircraft and non-mission
 12                                                               36WGI13-204 22 JULY 2011


           essential vehicles will be held at (departing 24L) or not considered clear of the
           runway (landing 06R) until they are located at the intersection of Taxiway
           Kilo/Charlie.
           1.6.2.2.2. Mission essential vehicles less than 10 feet are authorized to operate within
           the POFZ areas. Mission essential is defined as any vehicle requiring access to CMA
           area for continued runway ops.
1.7. Airfield Lighting Systems.
   1.7.1. The airport and visual lighting shall be operated as prescribed in FAAO 7110.65. All
   runways have HIRLs and PAPIs installed. Approach lights are as follows:
       1.7.1.1. Runway 06R: ALSF-1 standard with the following exception: one sequence
       flasher at the 1,000 foot roll bar has been removed (roll bar on paved taxiway shoulder).
       1.7.1.2. Runway 06L: SALS.
       1.7.1.3. Runway 24L: Modified SALS system, shortened due to terrain. There is 1,300
       feet of approach lighting (no sequenced flashers) terminating at the threshold lights.
       1.7.1.4. Runway 24R: ALSF-1.
   1.7.2. No-Light Minima. Changes to Approach Lighting System will be published by
   NOTAM by Airfield Management (AM). Refer to current DoD FLIPs (Terminal) for
   Pacific, Australasia, and Antarctica, Volume 1 for effects on minima.
1.8. Drag Chute Jettison Area. Taxiways Foxtrot and Kilo are designated as Drag Chute
Jettison Areas. If another area must be used, the aircrew will inform Andersen Ground of that
location. While turning off the runway, pilots will use sufficient power to prevent the chutes
from contacting the runway or taxiway lights. Aircraft will not drop chutes on the active runway
except for emergency reasons or when the winds exceed 15 knots. Pilots will immediately notify
Tower after jettisoning a chute on or near the runway. Tower will suspend operations to the
affected runway and notify AMOPS who will ensure drag chute is recovered (if Transient Alert
or 36 EAMXS are not available) and runway is free of debris before resuming runway ops.
   1.8.1. Transient Alert or 36 EAMXS are responsible for notifying Tower after drag chute
   retrieval.
NOTE: When aircraft notifies ATC that upon landing a drag chute will be employed and no
chute is observed on landing roll, Tower controllers shall transmit ―(CALL SIGN) APPEARS
NO CHUTE‖ on Tower or emergency frequency.
1.9. Arm/De-Arm Areas. The primary arm/de-arm areas are located on Taxiway F and South
Ramp 7 with the alternate being Taxiway K.(Attachment 2). The only area with painted lines
designating aircraft orientation and spacing is Taxiway F. Aircrew/Marshallers are responsible
for ensuring wingtip clearance at all times, especially if multiple MDSs are using arming areas,
or painted lines are not being used.
   1.9.1. Taxiway F Arm/De-arm. Six available arming slots are painted on Taxiway F. The
   painted lines on Taxiway F provide adequate wingtip clearance for aircraft with wingspans of
   46’ or less. Aircraft will fill arm/de-arm slots in sequence starting with the first available
   furthest from the runway. Aircraft will be oriented toward the overrun (Hdg 300°). Aircraft
36WGI13-204 22 JULY 2011                                                                         13

   060°).
   1.9.3. Taxiway K. The alternate Arm/De-arm location can be used when neither the primary
   or secondary locations are available on South Ramp 7. Aircraft will arm/de-arm in single file
   (staggered when able) on Taxiway K.
1.10. Open Fuel Cell Maintenance. The outdoor spots for open fuel tank maintenance are C-4,
C-40 and C-55, all of which are located on the center ramp. Prior to these areas being used
AMOPS must be notified (requires taxiway closure) and a 50’ cordon around the aircraft must be
established. The primary indoor facilities approved for open fuel tank maintenance are Hangars
1- 6, under the following conditions.
   1.10.1. All Hanger doors and nose dock/roll up doors will be fully open during the entire
   maintenance operation.

                            LOCAL AIRSPACE UTILIZATION

2.1. Andersen Air Force Base Local Flying Area. The local flying area is defined as the
ATCAAs and ranges within 300 miles of Andersen AFB.
2.2. Designated Training Areas/Scheduling. There are four areas set up for local flight
training, four published air refueling tracks AR-800, AR-801, AR-802, AR-803, and an IFR
military training route; IR-983. All information on air refueling tracks and IR-983 are published
in Flight Information Publication (FLIP) AP/3.
   2.2.1. The training areas are Air Traffic Control Assigned Airspace (ATCAA) Attachment
   6. Primary ATCAAs used are 1, 2, 3, and 5. All flight activities within these areas are
   conducted as Military Authority Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft
   (MARSA) in accordance with agreements on file with 36 OSS/OSA.
   2.2.2. The primary bombing range used at Andersen is R-7201 (Farallon De Medinilla
   (FDM)), which is located in the southern portion of ATCAA 3A. Attachment 7
   2.2.3. All training area airspace requests must be annotated on ZUA Form 7610-4 and
   submitted to Bomber Scheduling (366-3399) at least 1 week prior to training event. Bomber
   Scheduling will consolidate requests and submit to JRM Area Training.
2.3. Avoidance Areas. Avoid overflight of the following areas Attachment 8
   2.3.1. Andersen AFB EOD Range, along the beach at UAM R-295/1.5 DME. When active,
   avoid overflight within 2 NM radius below 1,600’ MSL or as directed by ATC.
   2.3.2. 36 MUNS Munitions Storage Area (MSA) 1, 1.5 NM east-southeast of North West
   Field; and MSA 2, just north of AAFB runway 06L/24R, between taxiways H and K. Avoid
   overflight below 1,600’ MSL.
   2.3.3. Naval Magazine, located 9.2 miles southwest of Guam International Airport (1 NM
   north of Fena Valley Reservoir). Avoid overflight below 1,400’ MSL.
   2.3.4. Guam Memorial Hospital, located 1 mile North West of Won Pat International
   Airport. Avoid overflight within 1 NM radius below 1,200’ MSL.
   2.3.5. US Naval Hospital, located 3.5 miles south of Guam International Airport. Avoid
   overflight within 1 NM radius below 1,200’ MSL.
   2.3.6. Guam Satellite Tracking Station. To avoid RF radiation hazards and interference with
   satellite tracking operations, aircraft are to avoid the area within 1 NM of UNZ R-033/12.2
   DME (main ramp area, North West Field), below 2,500’ MSL. Further information and
   procedures for the RF radiation hazard are identified in Paragraph 7.17.
   2.3.7. Cliff-line Restriction. Flight along Andersen’s cliff line is restricted to 1,000’ AGL or
   above due to environmental concerns. HSC-25 helicopters on an actual search and rescue
   mission are exempt from this requirement.
   2.3.8. Andersen Combat Arms Training Site, located near Sirena Beach at UAM R-295/1.3
   DME. Prior to range going active, CATM calls tower controllers who will advise local
36WGI13-204 22 JULY 2011                                                                         17


   traffic and change ATIS (if operational). Aircraft will avoid direct overflight below 1600’
   MSL when active. Further information is identified in Paragraph 7.17.
2.4. Terminal Radar Service Area (TRSA). A TRSA is centered on Andersen AFB. The
TRSA extends 15 miles in all directions from the center of the field. Within 5 miles, it extends
from the surface to 9,000’ MSL. From 5 miles to 15 miles, it exists between 2,000’ and 9,000’
MSL. Radar control service is provided by FAA Guam Combined Control Facility (ARTCC).
2.5. Class D Airspace. Andersen Tower’s Class D Airspace is divided into areas ―A‖ and ―B‖,
as depicted in Attachment 9 Andersen Tower retains control of Area "A" at and below 2,600
feet MSL. Guam ARTCC retains control of Area "B" at and below 2,600 feet MSL.
2.6. Aircraft Divert Locations. In this area of the Pacific, many airports have limited
navigational aids (NAVAIDs). Aircrews should review FLIP publications to verify suitability for
their type aircraft. The list below consists of possible, and more capable divert locations but in
no way should it construe suitability for all aircraft nor permission for use (by either airfield or
diplomatic authority).

Table 2.1. Aircraft Divert Locations
AIRPORT                                      NAVAIDS
Guam International (PGUM) (Referred to       (Radar available) ILS, VORTAC DME,
as Won Pat)                                  NDB
Saipan International (PGSN)                  ILS, NDB

   2.6.1. Due to Guam International airport’s unique location on Guam, coordination for divert
   to (PGUM) is much simpler than any other divert option. Upon notification from Guam
   ARTCC of an aircraft’s intention to divert from Andersen AFB to Guam International
   Airport, Tower shall gather the following information: aircraft call sign, type aircraft, ETA
   Guam International Airport (aka Won Pat), fuel remaining, personnel onboard, and reason
   for diversion.
   2.6.2. After obtaining the necessary information, Tower will notify Airfield Management
   Operations and CCTLR
   2.6.3. Airfield Management Operations shall in turn notify the AOF/CC and 36 WG/CP for
   further dissemination.
   2.6.4. It should be noted that there is no military presence at Won Pat and therefore aircrews
   should expect to experience considerable delay for support.
2.7. North West Field. North West Field is an abandoned airfield located approximately 6 NM
NW of Andersen AFB. 36 CRG is the scheduling agency for all North West Field activities.
Prospective users should contact 36 CRG at 366-2184 for the latest procedures for scheduling
and use of North West Field. If approved for operations, the using unit understands that North
West Field is a closed airfield and accepts the risk associated with operations at this location.

   3.1.3. Runway 24R: 627’ MSL (Field Elevation)
   3.1.4. Runway 24L: 609’ MSL
3.2. Selection of Primary Runway.
   3.2.1. The Tower Watch Supervisor will determine the runway in use based on current and
   forecasted winds. SOF will coordinate with the WS for Opposite Direction Operations or
   runway change based on mission requirements. As appropriate, tower will notify ARTCC,
   AMOPS, Agana Tower, and the Weather Flight (WF) of all runway changes.
NOTE: Whenever Agana and Andersen Towers are on different runways, delays can be
expected.
   3.2.2. Runways 06L/R are designated as the calm wind runways. Runway 06R is designated
   as the primary instrument runway. In the event conflicting wind information is obtained
   from the two wind sensors, the Tower Watch Supervisor will provide WF with the estimated
   winds from the Airfield Automated System (AFAS), and consult with before determining the
   runway in use.
3.3. Closing and Opening Runways and Suspending Runway Operations.
   3.3.1. AMOPS shall temporarily suspend/close runway operations when any unsafe
   condition affects runway operations. Only AMOPS can open or close a runway. Tower will
   suspend runway operations whenever the Watch Supervisor considers the runway unsafe for
   operations. Runway operations shall be suspended for a FOD check immediately following
   the situations listed in Para 3.3.2. unless the Airfield Manager or designated representative
   dictates otherwise. The Airfield Manager or his designated representative will subsequently
   determine the official runway status prior to resuming normal operations.
   3.3.2. Runway operations will automatically be suspended for the following:
       3.3.2.1. The Control Tower authorizes the Senior Fire Officer to proceed on to the
       runway in response to an aircraft emergency. The Senior Fire Officer is designated as
       incident commander for fire/rescue response to emergency aircraft and retains this
       position until he/she terminates the emergency. The Senior Fire Officer must explicitly
       advise the Control Tower if he/she is providing escort for other than fire protection
       vehicles.
       3.3.2.2. An aircraft is disabled on the runway.
       3.3.2.3. An aircraft designated an ―In Flight Emergency (IFE)‖ has landed.
 20                                                              36WGI13-204 22 JULY 2011


3.3.2.4 Tower or AMOPS receives notification of observed or possible foreign object debris
(FOD) on the runway.
         3.3.2.5. An aircraft lands with hung ordnance.
         3.3.2.6. Cable engagement or anytime Barrier Maintenance performs system
         maintenance/configuration changes on an arresting system that involves rigging or de-
         rigging of cables.
   3.3.3. While runway operations are suspended, aircraft will be limited to conducting
   restricted low approaches IAW para. 3.11.
NOTE: The Supervisor of Flying has been given the authority by the OG/CC to waive a FOD
check only in the interest of flight safety. A FOD check shall be accomplished by AMOPS
immediately following the recovery of affected airborne aircraft. Tower will notify AMOPS
whenever the SOF waives a FOD check making a ―SOF’s Call.‖
3.4. Local Aircraft Priorities. Local aircraft priorities are in accordance with FAAO 7110.65,
AFI 13-204 Vol 3 and AFJI 11-204, and as supplemented in this paragraph.
NOTE: SOF may coordinate with tower watch supervisor to adjust these priorities in the interest
of safety.
      3.4.1. Emergencies
NOTE: Manned Aircraft have priority over Unmanned Aircraft.
   3.4.2. Alert Launch.
   3.4.3. Air Evac Missions (requesting priority).
   3.4.4. Search and Rescue (SAR) Missions.
   3.4.5. Distinguished Visitor Aircraft (these aircraft will be handled as expeditiously as
   possible).
   3.4.6. IFR Operations.
   3.4.7. VFR Operations.
3.5. Radar Traffic Pattern. Guam ARTCC controls the radar traffic pattern.
   3.5.1. For Runways 24L/24R, standard climbout into the IFR traffic pattern is: ―TURN
   RIGHT HEADING TWO SIX ZERO AT DEPARTURE END OF RUNWAY, CLIMB AND
   MAINTAIN 2,500 (MSL).‖
   3.5.2. For Runways 06L/06R, standard climbout into the IFR traffic pattern is: ―FLY
   RUNWAY HEADING, CLIMB AND MAINTAIN 2,500 (MSL).‖
NOTE: Tower will issue altitude restrictions reference traffic in the overhead maneuver pattern
as appropriate (see paragraph 3.7).
   3.5.3. ASR and PAR approaches are not available at Andersen AFB.
   3.5.4. Tower will not assign an IFR departure a final altitude below 3,000' MSL when
   issuing IFR clearances, except as noted in paragraphs 3.5.1 or 3.5.2. or when assigned by
   Guam ARTCC.
36WGI13-204 22 JULY 2011                                                                      21


3.6. Tower VFR Traffic Patterns. Tower Watch Supervisor is the final approving authority
for use of the VFR traffic patterns (Attachment 10). Tower will notify Guam ARTCC of pattern
status changes. Tower Overhead traffic patterns are available with 2,000’ AGL ceiling or higher
and 3 miles or greater visibility.
   3.6.1. Normal direction of traffic for Runways 06L/24L is left turns. Normal direction of
   traffic for Runways 06R/24R is right turns. See Attachment 10. Pattern altitudes are as
   follows:

Table 3.1. Pattern Altitudes
PATTERN                                                         ALTITUDE
Overhead Maneuver Pattern                                       2,100’ MSL
Tactical Initial                                                2,100’ MSL
Rectangular Pattern                                             1,600’ MSL
Helicopter Pattern                                              1,100’ MSL
   3.6.2. VFR Entry Gates. Due to the lack of visual reporting points outside 5 NM of
   Andersen’s airfield, ATC utilizes VFR Entry Gates as pre-sequencing points versus VFR
   Entry Points. These gates are ―Gate Alpha‖ UAM 330/10 and ―Gate Bravo‖ UAM 190/10
   Attachment 8. Aircraft must be in contact with Andersen Tower and established at 2600’
   MSL prior to reaching the gates. Once through the gate aircraft can expect descent
   instructions to an overhead or rectangular pattern or maintain altitude instructions for VFR
   pattern entry at North or South Point.
       3.6.2.1. ―North Point‖ (N) is defined as over Ritidian Point, ―South Point‖ (S) is defined
       as 2NM south of Mt Santa Rosa. Attachment 8
   3.6.3. The standard fighter overhead pattern is flown at 2100' MSL with a Breakout to 2600'
   MSL back to the VFR Entry Point if required. If there is no Overhead Pattern available for
   fighters, ATIS will be updated to advise all aircraft: "VFR Overhead Pattern is closed."
   3.6.4. Tactical Initial. Fighters may request Tactical Initial at 2100' MSL when the
   Overhead Pattern is open. Fighters will fly Tactical Initial at 350 KIAS and 4000' Line
   Abreast by element. Flight leads will fly up initial aligned with the landing runway.
   Wingmen will be line abreast on the opposite side of the break. Aircraft will break at the
   approach end of the runway. Trailing elements will maintain 2 NM trail.
   3.6.5. Simulated Flameout Operations (SFO).          Simulated Flameout Operations are
   authorized for base assigned aircraft IAW Guam ARTCC, Andersen ATCT, and 36th
   Operations Group Letter of Agreement. Random Steep approaches, Random Shallow
   approaches, Aircraft Carrier Breaks or any similar maneuvers are NOT authorized at AAFB.
3.7. Protection of Aircraft in the Overhead Pattern. When aircraft are using the overhead
pattern, Tower will issue the following instruction to departing aircraft: ―MAINTAIN AT OR
BELOW 1,600’ UNTIL DEPARTURE END OF RUNWAY.‖
NOTE: RQ-4 unable to comply with altitude restriction; overhead pattern will be closed over
RQ-4’s departure runway.
3.8. Circling Maneuvers.
 22                                                                 36WGI13-204 22 JULY 2011


   3.8.1. When circling to the opposite runway, the approach lights will be switched from the
   runway in use to the landing runway when the aircraft conducting the approach is at mid-
   field on the downwind leg on the circling maneuver.
   3.8.2. When circling to the parallel runway, pilots will fly the approach to circling
   minimums and will determine when to commence the circling maneuver. Pilots shall advise
   Tower when they are commencing the circling maneuver.
   3.8.3. Circling maneuvers south of the airfield are NOT authorized.
3.9. Multiple Approaches/Landings. Multiple approaches to Andersen AFB are authorized for
military and DoD contract aircraft only.
3.10. Standard Missed Approach Procedures. Expect the following unless otherwise directed
by Guam ARTCC:
   3.10.1. RWY 06 – ―FLY RUNWAY HEADING, CLIMB AND MAINTAIN 2,500’ (MSL)‖
      3.10.2. RWY 24 – ―TURN RIGHT HEADING TWO SIX ZERO AT DEPARTURE END
      OF RUNWAY, CLIMB AND MAINTAIN 2,500’ (MSL)‖
3.11. Restricted Altitude Low Approaches. A low approach with an altitude restriction of not
less than 500 feet (1000’ for heavy aircraft) above the airport elevation may be authorized,
except over an aircraft in takeoff position or a departing aircraft. Aircraft will not be cleared for
a restricted low approach over personnel/vehicles unless the personnel/vehicles and the aircraft
making the restricted low approach have been advised that the approaches will be conducted and
both parties can maintain direct radio contact with Tower.
3.12. Special VFR (SVFR) Operations. SVFR operations shall be conducted in accordance
with FAAO 7110.65.
NOTE: SVFR not authorized for UAS aircraft
3.13. Helicopter Operations. Helicopters shall not take-off or land from South Ramp parking
areas with the exception of South Ramp 3 area. Helicopters may be authorized departure from
any other paved spot on the airfield, in lieu of using the runway, provided there is at least a 75-
foot clearance from any other stationary aircraft (including other helicopters); the helicopter does
not fly over any personnel, aircraft, or populated portion of the base. In addition, apply
separation and phraseology as specified in FAAO 7110.65.

3.15. Opposite Direction Traffic. Opposite direction operations may be authorized dependent
upon mission requirements (i.e. emergency, flight check, etc.). All opposite direction operations
require coordination between Guam ARTCC and Tower. Andersen Tower WS is the approval
authority for all opposite direction arrivals. All ATC coordination concerning opposite direction
traffic shall include the phrase, "OPPOSITE DIRECTION ARRIVAL/DEPARTURE RUNWAY
____." Approval for opposite direction operations will be dependent upon existing/anticipated
traffic and will not be approved for IFR air traffic unless the following criteria are met:
   3.15.1. Arrival versus Arrival: An arriving aircraft shall not proceed closer than 10 miles
   from the runway until the preceding opposite direction arrival aircraft has landed.
   3.15.2. Arrival versus Departure: An arriving aircraft shall not proceed closer than 10 miles
   from the runway until the opposite direction departure is airborne and on a course diverging
   by at least 45 degrees from the reciprocal of the arriving aircraft’s inbound course.
   3.15.3. Departure versus Arrival: A departing aircraft shall not depart once an opposite
   direction arrival aircraft is within 10 miles of the runway.
   3.15.4. VFR aircraft conducting opposite direction operations within Andersen Class Delta
   surface area the following cutoff minima shall apply:
       3.15.4.1. VFR Arrival vs. Arrival: Aircraft must report each other in sight, and ensure
       the opposing aircraft has crossed the landing threshold prior to the other aircraft reaching
       a point not less than 10 miles from the airport.
 24                                                                36WGI13-204 22 JULY 2011


      3.15.4.2. VFR Departure vs. Arrival: Aircraft must report each other in sight, and ensure
      the departure aircraft is airborne and turned to avert prior to the arrival reaching a point
      not less than 10 miles from the airport.
      3.15.4.3. VFR Arrival vs. Departure: Aircraft must report each other in sight and ensure
      the departure aircraft is airborne and turned to avert prior to the arrival reaching a point
      not less than 10 miles from the airport.
3.16. Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS) Standards. Reduced runway separation is
authorized IAW AFI 13-204 Vol 3, PACAF Supplement, and the following rules:
   3.16.1. The following Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS) standards (i.e. less than
   FAAO 7110.65 standard separation) apply to all PACAF assigned aircraft at PACAF bases
   where ATC is provided by USAF controllers. Non-PACAF aircraft may participate in RSRS
   if covered under letter of agreement (i.e. Joint Letter of Agreement on RSRS at PACAF
   bases).
   3.16.2. Conditions for application of RSRS standards.
      3.16.2.1. Air traffic controllers must be able to see the aircraft involved and determine
      distances by reference to suitable landmarks (i.e., distance markers, taxiways) for
      daytime and nighttime.
      3.16.2.2. Any aircrew or air traffic controller may refuse RSRS when safety of flight
      may be jeopardized. In these cases, apply appropriate separation standards published in
      FAAO 7110.65.
      3.16.2.3. Revert to nighttime RSRS standards when the RSC is reported as wet.
      3.16.2.4. For fighter-type aircraft only--a low-approach following a full stop shall use the
      alternate side of the runway when passing the aircraft on landing roll. Aircraft will not
      over-fly aircraft on the runway. Responsibility for separation rests with the pilot.
      Controllers must provide appropriate traffic advisories to aircraft involved.
      3.16.2.5. Pilots are responsible for wake turbulence separation when maintaining visual
      separation or operating VFR. Controllers must provide appropriate cautionary wake
      turbulence advisories in these cases.
      3.16.2.6. Same fighter-type aircraft operations mean the same airframe, i.e. F-15 behind
      F-15, F-16 behind F-16, etc.
      3.16.2.7. Dissimilar fighter-type aircraft operations mean not the same airframe, i.e., F-
      15 behind F-16, F-16 behind A-10, etc.
      3.16.2.8. Non-heavy, non-fighter-type aircraft operations mean C-130, C-12, B-737, etc.
      3.16.2.9. RSRS between formation full stops (holding hands) are authorized provided all
      aircraft involved are the same type aircraft (e.g., all F-15s, all F-16s, etc.). Separation is
      measured between the trailing aircraft in the lead formation and the lead aircraft in the
      trailing formation.
      3.16.2.10. Reduced same runway separation standards do not apply to:
          3.16.2.10.1. Any situation involving an emergency aircraft.
36WGI13-204 22 JULY 2011                                                                       25

          3.16.2.10.3. Air evacuation aircraft.
          3.16.2.10.4. A touch-and-go behind a full stop.
          3.16.2.10.5. ―Heavy" aircraft (capable of takeoffs weights of more than 300,000
          pounds).
          3.16.2.10.6. Non-US aircraft unless a letter of agreement is signed between the
          OG/CC and the non-US aircraft unit commander (i.e. detachment commander or
          equivalent) and approved by the MAJCOM A3 or equivalent.
NOTE: During contingency operations, the WG/CC (or equivalent) signs the LOA and forwards
a copy to the NAF and MAJCOM OPR for air traffic control.
          3.16.2.10.7. Controllers control formation flights as a single aircraft and do not apply
          RSRS standards between aircraft within the same formation (FAAO 7110.65, 2-1-
          13). Separation between aircraft within the formation is the responsibility of the
          flight leader and pilots of the other aircraft in the flight (FAAO 7110.65,
          Pilot/Controller Glossary).
   3.16.3. Daytime and nighttime RSRS distances will be IAW Standard FAAO 7110.65, and
   AFI 13-204 Vol 3, PACAF Supplement.

3.17. Unusual Maneuvers. Except for emergencies or special missions, deviations from local
traffic patterns will not be approved. Air traffic controllers may not approve unusual maneuvers
within the Class D airspace unless specifically covered in an approved letter of agreement and/or
the FAA grants a waiver. Waivers for conducting unusual maneuvers will be processed through
the 36 OSS/OSA, Airfield Operations Flight Commander, for approval by the FAA and
appropriate higher headquarters.

                                         Chapter 4

                           CONTROL OF GROUND TRAFFIC

4.1. Airfield Driving Operations. All vehicular operations on the airfield will be IAW 36 WGI
13-213, Andersen AFB Airfield Driving Instruction. Tower does not control vehicular traffic
outside the CMA. See para 1.6. for location of CMAs.
   4.1.1. 36 WGI 13-213, Andersen AFB Airfield Driving Instruction provides an overview of
   AM, airfield agency, and unit commander responsibilities for control of vehicle/pedestrian
   operations on the airfield, Airfield Driving Requirements, Agencies Authorized Privately
   Owned Vehicle (POV) Passes, Airfield Driving Violations and Penalties, Vehicle Traffic
   Procedures, Vehicular Call signs, Procedures for Gaining Access to the CMA (Access and
   Communications Responsibilities), Emergency vehicle operations (Fire and Rescue,
   Ambulance, Security Forces), Airfield Construction/Work Crew/Maintenance Restrictions
   and approved call-signs on the ―Ramp Net‖. CMA access will be coordinated via the
   ―Airfield Net‖.
4.2. Taxi Restrictions.
   4.2.1. All aircraft and equipment must remain behind taxiway/taxilane boundary to ensure
   proper lateral clearance is available for taxing aircraft. Boundary depiction below:




   4.2.2. In those areas designated as blind areas for Tower (Attachment 2) and when Transient
   Alert does not provide ―Follow Me‖ assistance, Tower will instruct taxiing aircraft to ―USE
   CAUTION, PORTIONS OF THE TAXIWAY ARE NOT VISIBLE FROM THE TOWER.‖
   4.2.3. With exception of aircraft scheduled to park on SR3 and HSC-25 on NR1 in front of
   HSC-25 hangar, aircraft will not drop off cargo or passengers on taxiways. Cargo and
   passenger upload/ download are only authorized on aircraft parking spots. In certain
   instances, parking on two parking spaces may be necessary for mission accomplishment. In
   extraordinary circumstances, airfield manager may approve upload/download on taxiways.
4.3. Towing/Taxiing/Engine Run Operations. AMOPS is the approving authority for all
engine run and aircraft movement operations. Notification of aircraft engine run-ups, towing,
and taxiing will be given to the Control Tower by AMOPS.
   4.3.1. Aircrews requesting engine start/taxi shall contact Tower on 121.7 or 275.8 for
   approval prior to engine start or as soon as practical if engine start is required for radio
   transmission.
   4.3.2. Ground personnel requesting towing, taxi, or engine run operations will contact
   AMOPS via phone (366-4188) or Ramp FM Net for approval and coordination, and contact
   Tower via UHF/VHF or Airfield FM Net prior to initiation. AMOPS will notify security
   forces via phone (366-2910) of all engine run-ups and towing operations.
36WGI13-204 22 JULY 2011                                                                       29


NOTE: In order to expedite the tow of emergency aircraft from the runway or taxiway after
landing, prior coordination with AMOPS is not required.
   4.3.3. Maintenance personnel will monitor frequencies 121.7, 275.8, or the Airfield FM Net
   during towing operations.
   4.3.4. Multi-engine jet aircraft will maintain at least 500 feet separation from other aircraft
   when taxiing. This procedure does not apply to formation operations.
   4.3.5. Maintenance idle engine runs (up to 80%) can be conducted by all aircraft (except
   heavy aircraft) on all airfield parking spots. Heavy aircraft maintenance idle runs are limited
   to idle/reverse idle only and can be conducted on all aircraft parking spots.
       4.3.5.1. Heavy aircraft maintenance idle engine runs above idle/reverse can be conducted
       on S93, S95, S97, N1 and N2. With AMOPS approval North Ramp 2/3 and South Ramp
       2 (two spots directly behind aircraft must be empty) are also available.
   4.3.6. Aircraft full power engine runs on spots not listed on Table 4.1 must be evaluated by
   36 OSS/OSAM and 36 WG/SE prior to approval.

Table 4.1. Full Power Engine Run Locations
AIRCRAFT            PARKING SPOTS
B-52, B-1, B-2      N-1/N-2. With AMOPS approval; Center Ramp hardstands and hardstands
                    on the south side of Taxilane Delta may be used.
C-5/C-17/KC-10      N-1/N-2. With AMOPS approval; North Ramp 2/3, South Ramp 2 (two
                    spots directly behind aircraft must be empty)
KC-135, C-130       N-1, N-2, South Ramp 1, (line up with blast deflectors, no aircraft parked

                    empty) and South Ramp 7.
Fighters            N-1, N-2, South Ramp 1 (line up with blast deflectors, no aircraft parked
                    directly behind) With AMOPS approval; South Ramp 2, 6, and 7.
RQ-4                S-79 after coordination with AMC.
4.4. Vehicle/Personnel Operations Within the Controlled Movement Area (CMA).
   4.4.1. Vehicular/personnel traffic in the controlled movement area must be kept to an
   absolute minimum. Permission to cross a runway for convenience will not be permitted.
   Maximum use of perimeter roads shall be utilized in lieu of runway/taxiway access.
   4.4.2. The CMA is dynamic and busy. Clear, concise and brief radio transmissions are
   crucial to safe operations. Radio communication will normally be established on the Airfield
   FM net. Before contacting Andersen Ground, scan the area for approaching or departing
   aircraft. Think about the radio call. Advise Andersen Ground of who you are, where you are,
   and what your request is. Finally, listen to Andersen Ground’s instructions and read back the
   instructions verbatim prior to entering the CMA.
NOTE: Examples of proper terminology are in 36 WGI 13-213, Andersen AFB Airfield Driving
Instruction.
       4.4.2.1. All personnel operating within the CMA must maintain two-way radio
       communication with Andersen Ground at all times.
 30                                                               36WGI13-204 22 JULY 2011


       4.4.2.2. All personnel will read back Andersen Ground instructions, prior to execution of
       their instructions. Read back of Andersen Ground issued hold instructions is mandatory.
   4.4.3. In the event the control Andersen Ground loses radio contact with vehicles within the
   CMA, the runway and/or taxiway lights will be flashed on and off at the highest setting
   followed by a flashing red light gun signal. At that time, all vehicles/personnel will exit the
   CMA until radio contact can be re-established. If vehicles are unable to contact the Andersen
   Ground while in the CMA, they will exit the runway beyond the hold lines and contact
   AMOPS to advise they are ―off‖ the runway, and the nature of the radio problems.
   4.4.4. Each access point leading to a runway is clearly marked with standard hold lines
   painted on the taxiway surface. These hold lines are two solid yellow lines accented by two
   dashed yellow lines. Only Andersen Ground can grant permission to cross a hold line and
   enter the CMA. If your vehicle is equipped with a rotating beacon, it should be used when
   operating within the CMA otherwise, use of four-way flashers will be used.
   4.4.5. All work groups requiring access into the CMA must coordinate with AMOPS to
   determine access requirements. It is possible for multiple vehicles to enter the CMA with a
   single radio.
       4.4.5.1. The work group supervisor is responsible for radio contact with Andersen
       Ground and will relay airfield position, number of vehicles, and duration requested within
       the CMA.
       4.4.5.2. All vehicles must be present at that time. If more vehicles are to join the group
       later, they must be separately coordinated for entry into the CMA.
       4.4.5.3. The work group supervisor will remain with the group in case the CMA needs to
       be cleared. The work group supervisor is responsible for all vehicles in the group and
       will ensure the CMA is cleared upon request of Andersen Ground. Andersen Ground
       will be advised when the CMA is no longer in use.
   4.4.6. AMOPS will, on an individual basis, advise Andersen Ground when
   vehicles/personnel are required to remain inside the CMA during aircraft operations.
   Andersen Ground will advise personnel of aircraft operations in relation to the movement
   area and will also inform aircraft of vehicle/personnel position.
NOTE: Aircraft arrivals/departures are not authorized with personnel/equipment on the
under/overrun.
4.5. Airfield, Ramp and Crash Net Monitoring Procedures.
   4.5.1. The following procedures outline the control tower and AMOPS responsibilities for
   monitoring the Airfield, Ramp and Crash Nets. These procedures are established to reduce
   the number of non-essential discussions being monitored in the control tower.
       4.5.1.1. Andersen Ground will monitor the Airfield Net for vehicles requiring access to
       or operating within the CMA.
       4.5.1.2. AMOPS will monitor the Ramp Net at all times. When AMOPS hears a
       vehicle/agency calling Andersen Ground on the Ramp Net for access to the CMA,
       AMOPS will advise vehicle or agency to switch to Airfield Net.

          controlled movement area.
          4.5.2.1.3. Automatically monitor the Crash Net whenever the Primary Crash Alarm
          System is activated, broadcast ―TOWER IS ON THE CRASH NET‖ upon initial
          monitoring, and broadcast ―TOWER IS OFF THE CRASH NET‖ upon termination
          of monitoring.
      4.5.2.2. Fire Department will:
          4.5.2.2.1. Call Tower on a landline, for Crash Net activation, whenever vehicle
          access into the controlled movement area is required and the Primary Crash Net
          Alarm System has not been activated.
          4.5.2.2.2. Acknowledge all on/off Crash Net calls by Andersen Ground.
4.6. Controlled Areas.
   4.6.1. The entire airfield has been designated as a controlled area by the 36 WG/CC. Entry
   to the airfield is only authorized for personnel conducting official business. All personnel
   working, visiting, or transiting the airfield must possess and produce identifying credentials
   when demanded.
   4.6.2. It’s in the collective best interests of everyone who works on the airfield to ensure
   only authorized personnel conducting official business operate in this designated controlled
   area. Custodians of non-priority aircraft parking and maintenance areas and commanders of
   units whose personnel perform duties within the airfield controlled area (regardless of
   whether or not their units exercise administrative or functional control over the airfield
   controlled area), will ensure control of all personnel assigned and challenge the following:
      4.6.2.1. Anyone whose presence or activity appears suspicious.
      4.6.2.2. Anyone they do not recognize as having a need to be in the area.
      4.6.2.3. Anyone committing an illegal act.
   4.6.3. When challenging personnel, attempt to verify their identity by having them produce a
   valid identification card. Additionally, you must verify the suspected person(s) need to be in
   the airfield controlled area.
   4.6.4. In all cases where the activity appears suspicious, and/or you are unable to verify
   identity and/or need to be in the area, contact the Andersen Security Forces Control Center
   (ASFCC) at 366-6666.
   4.6.5. Copies of listings of contractors performing duty on the airfield will be provided to
   ASFCC and AMOPS in the form of an Entry Authorization List (EAL) for verification
   purposes.

                                           Chapter 5

                                    RQ-4 OPERATIONS

5.1. Operational Procedures.
   5.1.1. Certificate Of Authorization (COA), Letter Of Agreement (LOA). Pilots will comply
   with each COA and LOA in effect between Andersen AFB and other Air Traffic Control
   (ATC) facilities. Currently, United States Air Force Air Combat Command (ACC) maintains
   a COA with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for RQ-4 Global Hawk Unmanned
   Aircraft Operations. Additionally Andersen AFB maintains a LOA specific to RQ-4
   operations with ACC DET 3 Guam and Center Radar Approach Control (Guam CERAP).
   5.1.2. Flight Following. Andersen Tower is not authorized to flight follow but will fulfill the
   "Visual Observer" duties outlined in the FAA Certificate of Authorization (COA) for the
   USAF Global Hawk UnmannedAircraft Systems dated Feb 2012.
      5.1.2.1. Andersen Tower will perform "Visual Observer" duties inside Andersen's Class
      D airspace only in order to comply with the 3 nautical mile lateral and 3,000' vertical
      visual observer limitation mandated in the FAA COA.
   5.1.3. Overflight Restriction. Aircraft under tower control shall not be permitted to overfly
   RQ-4 aircraft at any time. This procedure ensures separation in the event the RQ-4 executes
   an unplanned/emergency climb.
   5.1.4. Scheduling. An LRE pilot will coordinate RQ-4 scheduling and Temporary Flight
   Restriction (TFR) inputs/conflicts with the Global Hawk Operations Center (GHOC), 36th
   Operations Support Squadron (36 OSS), Guam ARTCC and appropriate liaison officers
   (LNO). An RQ-4 pilot will submit a DD-1801 flight plan and request a DD 175-1 flight
   weather brief in accordance with 36 OSS procedures. RQ-4 LRE pilots will abide by 36 WG
   local operating procedures.
      5.1.4.1. The 36 WG Airspace Manager (or FAA-approved designee) will schedule all
      TFRs and ensure applicable NOTAMs are published for RQ-4 missions. All TFR
      scheduling requests and changes will be made in accordance with FAA requirements.
   5.1.5. Engine Start. The RQ-4 mission initiates with maintenance towing the aircraft to the
   mission start point. Limitations in the aircraft design preclude starting and taxiing from any
   location other than the surveyed start points. The launch and recovery element (LRE) pilot,
   RQ-4 Mobile, and the crew performing the engine start will monitor ground frequency during
   engine start operations.
   5.1.6. Taxi. Once notified of RQ-4 taxi, Andersen Ground Control will ensure the RQ-4
   proposed taxi route is deconflicted. RQ-4 Mobile will clear the taxi path and expeditiously
   notify Ground Control of any required taxi delay. RQ-4 Mobile will ―shadow‖ all RQ-4
   ground movements and conduct runway run-ins for all takeoffs and landings.
   5.1.7. Takeoff. The primary runway for RQ-4 operations is 06R. The RQ-4 LRE pilot will
   ensure RQ-4 Mobile visually clears the approach corridor and active runway for potential
   conflicts. Upon receiving the RQ-4 LRE pilot’s request for access to the active runway,
36WGI13-204 22 JULY 2011                                                                      35


  Andersen Tower will ensure the Andersen Class D airspace is clear of all non-ATC
  controlled aircraft before giving takeoff clearance.
     5.1.7.1. The pilot will confirm status of barrier configuration with Andersen Ground
     Control prior to takeoff.
     5.1.7.2. The RQ-4 Mobile will shadow the RQ-4 during takeoff to monitor for excess
     side-drift or aircraft problems. If a takeoff abort is required, the RQ-4 Mobile or the LRE
     pilot will report over tower frequency ―Abort, Abort, Abort‖. The aircraft will rapidly
     decelerate to a stop and remain on the runway until a maintenance team arrives to tow the
     aircraft. There is no ability for the RQ-4 to taxi clear of the runway following a takeoff
     abort.
  5.1.8. Departure. From the time the RQ-4 aircraft takes the runway for departure, until it
  reaches UAM 317/08 (GECKO), ATC will ensure no aircraft are cleared to land or depart
  from that runway. Prior to this point, the RQ-4 has the potential to land opposite direction to
  the same runway for an emergency return. Once past GECKO, normal operations will be
  resumed.
  5.1.9. Traffic Pattern. The RQ-4 local traffic pattern follows a fixed route to the North at a
  predetermined altitude that maximizes time over water and compensates for dead-engine
  glide distance. Attachment 13
     5.1.9.1. Air traffic control and RQ-4 aircrews will use the designated UA Zone for
     departure/arrival points to/from Andersen AFB. This UA Zone is a 40NM orbit around
     UNZ 315 Radial at 60NM (Attachment 12). The UA Zone will be used to segregate RQ-
     4 aircraft traffic due to poor weather, airfield congestion, lost link and aircraft
     emergencies.
  5.1.10. Arrival. ATC will ensure no local aircraft are sequenced inside an RQ-4 once the
  RQ-4 has reached 10 flying miles from the approach end of the runway. The RQ-4 Mobile
  will report the aircraft in sight and any potential conflicts to the RQ-4 Pilot. Once inside 10
  flying miles, the RQ-4 has priority to the landing runway.
  5.1.11. Landing. The RQ-4 is programmed to land approximately 500’ past the runway
  threshold. Winds, runway slope, fuel imbalances, or other factors may affect the exact
  touchdown point. RQ-4 Mobile will monitor landing progress and may, prior to touchdown,
  transmit ―go-around, go-around, go-around‖ over tower frequency should continued
  approach/landing endanger the aircraft or personnel on the ground. Once the aircraft is
  below 200’ AGL, a go-around is no longer possible.
     5.1.11.1. The pilot will confirm status of barrier configuration with Andersen Tower
     prior to landing.
     5.1.11.2. After landing, the RQ-4 will stop on the runway. The RQ-4 Mobile will
     conduct a brief visual inspection of the aircraft, after which the pilot will resume RQ-4
     taxi to the pre-determined taxiway.
     5.1.11.3. Circumstances may require the RQ-4 to be shutdown on the runway. In this
     case, maintenance vehicles will request clearance from Andersen Ground for runway
     access for tow operations. If a shutdown on the runway is anticipated, maintenance
36                                                                  36WGI13-204 22 JULY 2011


     crews may pre-position their vehicles on a taxiway to reduce the time needed to clear the
     runway.
     5.1.11.4. After landing and prior to taxi to parking, Andersen Ground Control will ensure
     the RQ-4 taxi route is deconflicted. RQ-4 Mobile will clear the taxi path and
     expeditiously notify Ground Control of any required taxi delay.
  5.1.12. Go-Around. The RQ-4 pilot may command, or the aircraft may autonomously
  execute a go-around inside the FAF due to a system fault or other anomaly. RQ-4 Go-Around
  is a climb to 2500 feet MSL until one mile off the end of the runway. From there, the RQ-4
  will climb to 10,000 feet MSL and fly a pre-planned route back to the landing runway. The
  pilot can adjust heading and altitude per controller’s instructions. In the event of an
  emergency requiring an immediate landing; pilots will coordinate with ATC to the maximum
  extent possible, which runway the RQ-4 will attempt landing.
  5.1.13. Hot Brakes. All hot brake conditions, suspected or confirmed, will be treated as
  emergencies. The RQ-4 will exit at Taxiway ―J‖ or ―F‖, if able, before ground support
  personnel have an opportunity to confirm hot brakes. If unable to clear the runway,
  coordination is required to confirm hot brakes on the runway prior to towing. If hot brakes
  are confirmed, the aircraft will remain on the taxiway or runway until cleared by the Incident
  Commander (IC) for continued taxi or towing.
  5.1.14. Lost Link. If lost link occurs, RQ-4 pilot/operator will immediately notify ATC with
  the following information, if applicable:
     5.1.14.1. Time of lost link.
     5.1.14.2. Last known position.
     5.1.14.3. Altitude.
     5.1.14.4. Direction of flight.
     5.1.14.5. Confirmation of lost link procedures.
     5.1.14.6. Confirmation pilot/Mobile has visual contact with RQ-4.
     5.1.14.7. In the event of lost link, lost communication between RQ-4 pilot/operator and
     ATC or lost communication between RQ-4 pilot/operator and Mobile, ATC will do the
     following:
         5.1.14.7.1. Cease aircraft launches until status of affected RQ-4 is determined.
         5.1.14.7.2. Recover other RQ-4 as appropriate.
         5.1.14.7.3. Issue advisories and ATC instructions as appropriate to ensure safe
         operations for all aircraft.
         5.1.14.7.4. Coordinate with Guam ARTCC for sterilization of the UAS Zone.
  5.1.15. Termination Procedures. Anytime the pilot deems the RQ-4 incapable of continued
  flight, successful divert, landing, or safety is jeopardized, it may be desirable to terminate
  (crash) the aircraft at the pre-planned location. Pilots will direct the aircraft to an area defined
  as a five nautical mile radius around 13 37.577N/144 48.509E (Attachment 13) ATC will
  clear the airspace enroute to the crash point and assist in post crash response.
36WGI13-204 22 JULY 2011                                                                    37


5.2. Communications:
   5.2.1. Andersen ATC. Andersen Ground and Tower controllers will maintain UHF/VHF
   and LMR connectivity with the RQ-4 pilot and RQ-4 Mobile. Radio check between UAS
   pilot/operator and ATC will be conducted prior to operations. Telephone communications
   may be used as a backup.
   5.2.2. RQ-4 LRE Pilot. The pilot communicates with RQ-4 Mobile and Air Traffic Control
   (ATC) agencies via Land Mobile Radio (LMR), UHF/VHF radios, and/or telephone. Before
   operations, the pilot will confirm telephone connectivity with Guam ARTCC.
   5.2.3. RQ-4 Mobile. The RQ-4 Mobile communications suite will consist of an LMR and
   UHF/VHF radio (cell phone may be carried for backup communications). RQ-4 Mobile shall
   monitor Andersen Ground or Tower frequencies during all RQ-4 taxi, takeoff and landing
   operations. RQ-4 Mobiles shall not perform ATC functions and will limit use of ATC
   frequencies to those transmissions necessary for safe RQ-4 operations.
5.3. Mobile Operations:
   5.3.1. Responsibility. The RQ-4 Mobile is responsible to visually clear for the pilot-in-
   control during all vehicle ground operations from engine start through aircraft liftoff, and
   landing until the aircraft is off the runway and the engine is shut down. The RQ-4 Mobile is
   responsible for all vehicle operations on the runway during launch, and recovery operations.
      5.3.1.1. RQ-4 Mobile will perform a radio check with tower prior to operating in the
      controlled movement area.
   5.3.2. Departures. RQ-4 Mobiles are automatically cleared onto the runway when the RQ-4
   is cleared onto the runway. RQ-4 Mobiles shall coordinate with tower if additional vehicles
   are required on the runway. After aircraft departure, RQ-4 Mobile will depart the runway at
   the next available taxiway and notify Tower when off the active runway.
   5.3.3. Arrivals. RQ-4 Mobiles are automatically cleared onto the runway behind the RQ-4
   when the aircraft crosses the landing threshold. When the aircraft and RQ-4 Mobile are clear
   of the runway, RQ-4 Mobile shall report off to the tower and then request taxi to park.
   5.3.4. Staging Areas and Run-In. When runway 06 is active, RQ-4 Mobile may use either
   taxiway Foxtrot or taxiway Echo for staging and run-ins to the runway. When runway 24 is
   active, RQ-4 Mobile may use either taxiway Kilo or taxiway Juliet.
5.4. RQ-4/Mobile Standard Safety Calls:
   5.4.1. "Stop Taxi, Stop Taxi, Stop Taxi" to direct a Stop Taxi
   5.4.2. "Abort, Abort, Abort" to direct a Takeoff Abort
   5.4.3. ―Shut Down, Shut Down, Shut Down‖ to direct Emergency Fuel Shutoff
   5.4.4. "Go Around, Go Around, Go Around" to direct a Go Around

       6.3.3.4. Medical treatment facility.
       6.3.3.5. Command Post.
       6.3.3.6. Civil Engineering.
       6.3.3.7. Security Forces.
   6.3.4. Requests for additions/deletions to SCN must be coordinated through the Airfield
   Manager and forwarded to the Operations Support Squadron Commander (OSS/CC) for
   approval/disapproval. Full justification for talk back or listen only capability must be
   annotated.
NOTE: Total number allowed on the net is limited by capacity of the system.
   6.3.5. Andersen AMOPS will conduct and document a daily operational check of the SCN
   between 0815L and 0845L. Backup procedures will be tested at least quarterly and
   documented on the AF IMT 3616.
   6.3.6. Only use the SCN to relay information critical to aircraft and airfield operations (e.g.,
   weather warnings, in-flight emergencies (IFEs), ground emergencies, Force Protection
   Condition (FPCON) levels, EOC activations/recalls, bomb threats, or terrorist activities.) Use
   other forms of communication to relay non-critical information.
 40                                                                36WGI13-204 22 JULY 2011


   6.3.7. AMOPS is the primary activation authority for the SCN. When mission requirements
   dictate, the SCN may be installed/activated by another agency provided a letter of agreement
   exists between AM and the other agency. Operating procedures will be clear, concise on
   whom the activation authority is, and when the SCN is used. Regardless of activation
   authority, the SCN will be operated and maintained in accordance with AFI 13-204 Vol 3.
   6.3.8. Questions, requests for clarifications or requests for retransmissions will be made after
   the initial message has been passed. Users will be polled one at a time in the order of those
   remaining on the net after message transmission.
   6.3.9. When supporting 36 WG operability exercises that affect the aircraft movement area,
   each message will be prefaced and end with ―EXERCISE, EXERCISE, EXERCISE.‖
6.4. Emergency Response Procedures. For in-flight and ground emergencies, the Senior Fire
Officer serves as the IC and will command all on-scene actions until relieved, providing life
saving and fire rescue support. In the event of an on or off-base mishap, emergency response
procedures are identified in 36 WG Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP 10-
2).
6.5. Hot Brakes Areas and Procedures.
   6.5.1. Normal hot brake areas are the East and West ends of Taxiway C at the intersections
   of Taxiway E, F and Taxiway K respectively. See Attachment 2.
   6.5.2. Crewmembers will notify Tower anytime hot brakes are suspected. Tower will
   activate the PCAS and if conditions permit, direct aircraft to one of the designated "hot
   brake" areas.
   6.5.3. Tower will direct other aircraft taxiing or vehicles via alternate routes to avoid passing
   within 300 feet of the hot brake aircraft, if practical.
   6.5.4. Crewmembers suspecting that their aircraft has hot brakes will notify the Tower and
   taxi to the nearest hot brake area and, when practical, remain clear of other aircraft.
   6.5.5. The 734 AMS will assume marshalling and safing responsibility for AMC aircraft
   with hot brakes. 36 EAMXS will assume responsibility for aircraft under the control of the
   OG/CC. Transient Alert (TA) will be responsible for other transient aircraft.
   6.5.6. The Fire Department will respond to the hot brake aircraft and assume a surveillance
   position not closer than 100 feet unless the Senior Fire Officer determines a fire is imminent.
   6.5.7. The Marshalling/Safing authority specified in 6.5.5 will notify the Fire Department of
   any hot brake(s) condition and advise the Senior Fire Officer and AMOPS of the actions
   required. The Fire Department is required to monitor any movement of aircraft with
   overheated/hot brakes. After declaration of a hot brake condition, the Senior Fire Officer is
   the only official authorized to declare the aircraft fire safe.
   6.5.8. If a hot brake condition is confirmed, pilots will shut down the engines and egress the
   aircraft after aircraft has been chocked. If a hot brake condition is not present and has been
   verified by ground personnel, taxi to the parking area.
   6.5.9. When the aircraft with hot brakes is declared fire safe and is released by the Senior
   Fire Officer, the Marshall/Safing authority will (as applicable to aircraft type):
36WGI13-204 22 JULY 2011                                                                         41


       6.5.9.1. Chock the nose landing gear.
       6.5.9.2. Safe any ejection seats. TA will request transient aircraft pilots to perform this
       action.
       6.5.9.3. Inspect and evaluate brakes for heat dissipation. Use a blower to cool brakes, if
       required.
       6.5.9.4. Tow aircraft to a designated parking location when declared safe.
   6.5.10. Hot Brake Aircraft in the Parking Area. When an aircraft with hot brakes is detected
   in the parking area, in addition to the procedures above, the following will apply:
       6.5.10.1. Engines running. The Tower will direct the aircraft to taxi to the nearest clear
       area on the main parallel taxiway and stop. This will be done at the discretion of the
       aircrew.
       6.5.10.2. Engines shut down. All non-essential personnel will be evacuated and, if
       practical, nearby aircraft within a 300-foot radius, will be removed.
6.6. Hung Ordnance Area. When recovering with hung ordnance, aircrew will notify the SOF
(if available) and Tower. Hung ordnance does not mean an emergency will be declared. Pilot or
SOF will notify ATC as soon as this decision has been made. If EOD is required, the pilot or
designated agency must declare an emergency. Aircraft landing with hung ordnance should fly
an approach to and land on Runway 24R/24L. If winds are out of limits for a Runway 24R/24L
landing, the aircraft should request a circling approach to land on Runway 06R/06L, avoiding
overflight of populated areas and buildings if possible. Aircraft landing with hung ordnance will
park at C-4 or C-68. Fighters with guns on spot C-4 will point on a magnetic heading of 290
degrees. If on spot C-68, point East to North East. See Attachment 2.
6.7. Abandonment of Aircraft. The controlled bailout and ejection area is centered on and
extends the length of Runway 06R/24L and is bounded South of Taxiway Charlie and North of
Taxiway Bravo. Attachment 14
   6.7.1. If the flight crew elects to abandon the aircraft due to an emergency situation and
   conditions permit, the pilot will fly over the controlled bailout/ejection area on a track of 064
   degrees, set the autopilot, and bail out/eject over the bailout/ejection area.
   6.7.2. Tower will describe the bailout area as: ―THAT AREA OVER RWY 06R/24L‖
   6.7.3. Guam ARTCC will assist the pilot in maneuvering to a safe bailout area to the extent
   possible.
   6.7.4. Control Tower will plot coordinates of aircraft impact area and relay to AMOPS, if
   able.
6.8. External Stores Jettison Area.
   6.8.1. Restricted Area R-7201, Farallon De Medinilla Island (16 01’N, 146 05’E, UAM
   022/160), is the primary jettison area for Andersen AFB (Attachment 7). For aircraft that
   cannot proceed to R-7201, or during emergency conditions (IFR/VFR), aircrews will ensure
   the aircraft is a minimum of 12 NM from any land mass and clear of all shipping prior to
   jettison of external stores. Guam ARTCC will provide radar assistance to the extent able.
6.9. Tower Fly-By for Abnormal Gear Indications or Gear Malfunctions.
 42                                                               36WGI13-204 22 JULY 2011


   6.9.1. OG assigned aircraft with abnormal gear operation or signs of gear malfunction during
   any part of flight should fly-by the Tower (as directed) prior to landing for a visual check of
   the landing gear. The SOF will be responsible for the visual check of all aircraft.
   6.9.2. The SOF may request the Tower to assist with the check as needed. Tower shall use
   phraseology IAW FAAO 7110.65 chapter 3, section 1, and relay the appearance of the
   landing gear.
6.10. Fuel Dump Procedures. Fuel dumping shall be conducted in the vicinity of Andersen
AFB TACAN (UAM) 150 Radial 015-025 DME, with standard right turns at or above 6000’
feet, and advise Guam ARTCC of intentions.
6.11. Aircraft Isolation Procedures. If an aircraft requires isolation after landing for fuel
leaks, contamination, or other reasons, preliminary isolation areas are the intersection of
Taxiway C and Taxiway K and Taxiway F between Taxiway C and Runway 06L/24R. These
areas are designated for planning only and are not mandatory (with the exception of hydrazine
leaks due to the inherent danger). The 36 WG Command Post or AMC Command Post will
notify Tower and AMOPS in advance of any requirements for isolation of aircraft, and if
preplanned isolation or an isolated parking location will be used.
   6.11.1. Hydrazine Isolation Procedures. When an F-16 declares an emergency, Tower will
   request Emergency Power Unit (EPU) status. If the pilot indicates EPU has activated, then
   hydrazine has been introduced into the aircraft systems and a 300-foot cordon must be
   maintained around the aircraft until fire department declares the aircraft safe.
       6.11.1.1. Parking locations if EPU has been activated is the intersection of Taxiway C
       and Taxiway K and Taxiway F between Taxiway C and Runway 06L/24R.
       6.11.1.2. Runway operations may resume after airfield management does a runway
       sweep provided theF-16 is parked as indicated above.
6.12. NORDO/Lost Communications Landing Procedures. In addition to those procedures
outlined in section A of the DoD Flight Information Handbook, the following additional
procedures will be used for alerting the Tower and executing a landing at Andersen AFB when
radio communications are lost/no radio (NORDO). HSC-25 lost comm procedures will be
executed IAW local LOA. Every attempt will be made to contact Tower through alternate
means.
   6.12.1. All total communications failures are to be considered emergencies due to the
   unknown condition of the aircraft.
   6.12.2. If communications cannot be established with the Tower when a landing is required,
   the following procedures will be followed:
       6.12.2.1. Determine the active runway and direction of traffic by the best means
       available. Enter the normal VFR traffic pattern to overfly the runway at traffic pattern
       altitude. Rock wings adjacent to Tower and watch for light gun signals.
       6.12.2.2. Tower will transmit landing instructions on the appropriate radio frequencies
       and use light gun signals to relay instructions.
NOTE: Tower will notify UAS pilot/operators of all NORDO aircraft.
36WGI13-204 22 JULY 2011                                                                       43


       6.12.2.3. Upon receipt of clearance, either by light gun signal or radio from alternate
       sources, the pilot will land as soon as practical.
       6.12.2.4. In the event of lost communications, aircraft in IMC conditions will, if
       practical, continue with the approach and land. If an approach clearance has not been
       issued, execute the expected approach and land.
       6.12.2.5. In the event of a missed approach, aircraft will execute the published missed
       approach procedure.
6.13. Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT). FAA reserves to the first five minutes of every
hour for testing ELTs. Testing shall be restricted to three audio sweeps. ATC personnel will
normally handle an unscheduled personnel, emergency, or crash locator beacon signal, as an
emergency, regardless of duration.
   6.13.1. When the Tower receives an ELT that is not a test, the following procedures will
   apply:
       6.13.1.1. Tower will determine frequency and notify Guam ARTCC and Airfield
       Management Operations of the signal, its frequency and advise termination.
       6.13.1.2. Tower/Guam ARTCC will solicit assistance from other aircraft and forward
       information on bearing fixes to Airfield Management Operations, as necessary.
   6.13.2. AMOPS will notify the 36 WG Command Post.
   6.13.3. 36 WG Command Post will:
       6.13.3.1. If the signal is on 121.5 MHz, notify the Joint Rescue Coordination Center
       (JRCC) at DSN 339-7100.
       6.13.3.2. If the signal is on 243.0, call Transient Alert to initiate an on base search for
       signal source. Transient Alert can be reached at 366-8012/8013.
       6.13.3.3. When notified that the ELT has been found or has stopped, advise AMOPS. If
       the ELT cannot be found, consider it an actual emergency.
       6.13.3.4. In case of an actual emergency, pass/confirm all information to AMOPS and
       begin log entries.
6.14. Overdue Aircraft Procedures. For local flight plans not entered in the FAA system,
AMOPS will request a preliminary search when neither communication nor radar contact can be
established after an aircraft is 30 minutes overdue. Upon detection or report of overdue aircraft,
control agencies will notify AMOPS and 36 WG Command Post.
6.15. ATC Tape Recordings. In the event of an aircraft mishap, hazardous air traffic report
(HATR) or facility deviation, the Tower will retain ATC tape recordings and other related
information (logs, flight strips, etc.) IAW AFI 13-204 and applicable PACAF supplements.
Safeguard written facility records, including events log, position logs, flight data strips and
weather data. As soon as feasible, remove, label, store and safeguard pertinent recording tapes
(analog and digital), cassettes and discs. The OSS AOF/CC has ―custodial responsibility‖ for
safeguarding ATC tape recordings and other related information (logs, flight strips, etc.)
Coordination is required with the AOF/CC for release of any transcripts, etc.
 44                                                               36WGI13-204 22 JULY 2011


6.16. Andersen Tower Alternate Facility Evacuation Operations. Procedures can be found
is 36 OSS/OSA OI 13-205 Andersen Tower Alternate Facility Operations.
   6.16.1. Tower Evacuation Due to High Winds. Tower will be evacuated when wind velocity
   reaches a sustained 60 knots, peak gusts of 72 knots or when the Tower Watch Supervisor
   deems necessary for controller safety. Tower will run appropriate checklists and advise all air
   traffic that they are evacuating and for all aircraft to contact ARTCC for air traffic services.
   6.16.2. For high wind evacuation, Tower personnel will proceed to the first floor of the
   control tower to facilitate rapid restoral of ATC services once the wind has subsided. For
   evacuation due to bomb threat, communications failure, fire, etc., Tower controllers will
   relocate to AMOPS.
   6.16.3. During Tower evacuation, Airfield lighting personnel will be responsible for control
   of runway/approach light setting controls as determined by ATC.
6.17. Guam ARTCC Evacuation. Should conditions warrant evacuation of Guam ARTCC, all
airspace will revert to Oakland ARTCC control and appropriate NOTAMs will be initiated by
the FAA. If in-flight, pilots can contact Oakland ARTCC on appropriate High Frequency.
Expect departure and arrival delays. The Guam Control Area will become a non-radar
environment with all aircraft being sequenced through Nimitz VORTAC.
6.18. Airfield Management Operations Evacuation.
   6.18.1. In case of evacuation, AMOPS will relocate and conduct operations in Building
   2510. Building 2510 is equipped to support all AMOPS mission requirements.
   6.18.2. Due to being located on the airfield, aircrews are required to request crew bus service
   or they can transport themselves to Building 2510 if they possess a GOV and Andersen AFB
   airfield-driving qualification.
6.19. Additional Guidance. 36 WG FSCP directs Tower and AMOPS actions in support of
response and recovery from a major peacetime accident, natural disaster, Weapons of Mass
Destruction incident or enemy attack.
6.20. Air Base Defense. Procedures shall be executed as outlined in the HQ 13 AF and Guam
ARTCC MOU; subject Guam Area Air Defense Operations and Authorization For Interceptor
Operations.
36WGI13-204 22 JULY 2011                                                                      45


                                          Chapter 7

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROCEDURES

7.1. Airfield Inspections and Checks. AMOPS will conduct airfield inspections and checks
IAW 36 OSS/OSAM OI 13-213. A quarterly joint airfield inspection comprised of
representatives from airfield management (AFM/DAFM), AOF/CC, TERPS liaison, SE (flight
and ground), (SOF (host/tenant), CES (waivers/pavements) and SFS (highly recommended) will
be conducted. Additionally, an annual airfield safety and certification inspection will be
conducted in April.
7.2. Flight Planning, Prior Permission Required (PPR) and FLIP Procedures. AMOPS
personnel will perform flight planning and PPR procedures IAW 36 OSS/OSAM OI 13-213.
Tower and AMOPS personnel will monitor and request changes to Andersen AFB entries in
Flight Information Publications (FLIP) IAW FLIP General Planning, AFI 11-201 and 36
OSS/OSAM OI 13-213 as applicable.
   7.2.1. Specific procedures to allow crewmembers to file flight plans via fax/email:
      7.2.1.1. Crewmember Responsibilities:
          7.2.1.1.1. Fax completed DD Form 1801, International Flight Plan (to include
          formation flight plans) to Airfield Operations (366-6217)/email 36oss-
          osam@andersen.af.mil NLT 2 hours prior to the proposed departure time.
          7.2.1.1.2. Crewmember host unit or detachment must maintain the original, signed
          copy of the flight plan on file for 90 days according to Air Force RDS Table 13-07,
          Rule 03.00. Base assigned units shall provide AMOPS a Master 1801 flight plan and
          desired ―Canned/Stereo‖ routes NLT 48 hrs prior to first flight requiring the use of
          these routes.
          7.2.1.1.3. Call AMOPS (366-4188 or 5212) and confirm receipt of the faxed flight
          plan. Give operating initials to the AMOPS dispatcher.
          7.2.1.1.4. Advise AMOPS with any updates (additions/deletions) to the flight plan as
          soon as possible. Changes inside of 30 minutes prior to ETD are likely to result in
          clearance delays from FAA.
      7.2.1.2. 36 OSS AMOPS Responsibilities:
          7.2.1.2.1. Review faxed flight plan for accuracy and completeness. Input the flight
          plan into the AIS-R flight data system as soon as practical. Any problems or
          questions will be addressed to the unit’s operations desk.
          7.2.1.2.2. AMOPS will forward all necessary information concerning a formation
          operation to the Tower and Guam ARTCC upon receipt of the formation flight plans.
          7.2.1.2.3. Call arrival and departure times to the appropriate agencies.
   7.2.2. Unless covered by a LOA, all other agencies must file a signed flight plan in person at
   AMOPS.
 46                                                             36WGI13-204 22 JULY 2011


   7.2.3. Organizations requesting the ability to file flight plans through means other than in-
   person must coordinate a LOA between the requesting organization’s commander and
   36 OSS Airfield Manager.
7.3. Control of Aircraft Carrying Hazardous Material and/or Inert Devices. The Joint
Travel Regulations (JTR) and AFI 11-204 govern handling of all aircraft carrying hazardous
cargo landing at or departing from Andersen AFB.
   7.3.1. A requirement for an Andersen PPR is declaration of HAZMAT. If HAZMAT is
   onboard a non-combat-coded aircraft, AMOPS will consult ATOC to ensure adequate
   handling capability prior to issuing the PPR. On combat-coded aircraft, parking
   arrangements based on necessary separation will be reviewed by AMOPS prior to issuing a
   PPR. A PPR will not be issued to an aircraft carrying unknown HAZMAT. AMOPS will
   coordinate parking assignments with 36 MXS Transient Alert or AMC Command Post and
   Fire Alarm Communications Center (FACC) prior to the aircraft’s arrival of the planned
   parking spot. Most aircraft parking locations on the center ramp may be used for explosives
   laden aircraft. Standard parking locations for aircraft carrying hazardous material and/or
   inert devices are depicted on Andersen’s D-8 Tab. This tab is posted at AMOPS and copies
   can be obtained at the 36 CES Geobase Office (366-4314).
   7.3.2. Tower will contact AMOPS for parking assignment for all aircraft not previously
   coordinated.
7.4. Firing Range Activities/Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD). When the Andersen AFB
EOD or firing range (both located near Sirena Beach) is activated the following actions will be
accomplished IAW 36 WGI 32-3001:
   7.4.1. Firing Range Activities IAW 36 WG/CC’s ORM Assessment:
       7.4.1.1. Engineering Technical Letter 08-11 requires the firing range to have an
       established VDZ covering the entire SDZ based on the weapons utilized for training.
       Due to the location of the range the SDZ covers much of the base airfield and cantonment
       areas. Therefore to mitigate risk to Andersen aircraft and personnel the procedures
       outlined below preclude range overflight during live fire operations by low flying
       aircraft. These procedures will significantly enhance safety with negligible impact to
       either Andersen AFB flying or range operations.
       7.4.1.2. 36 SFS/S4/Combat Arms Training and Maintenance (CATM) NCOIC or
       authorized range users will contact 36 OSS/OSAT (366-4737/4281) via telephone 30
       minutes prior to and immediately upon termination of all live fire operations. 36 SFS or
       users will verify with 36 OSS/OSAT 5 minutes prior to commencing live fire operations
       to ensure approval is granted. Should 36 OSS/OSAT request cease-fire, 36 SFS will
       notify tower when firing has ceased to allow aircraft to over fly the range. 36 SFS will
       fax a weekly firing range schedule to AMOPS (366-6217) NLT 1700L on Friday for the
       following week.
       7.4.1.3. 36 OSS (Tower Controllers) will:
          7.4.1.3.1. IAW 36 WG/CC’s ORM assessment, inform all aircraft of live fire
          operations at the small arms range and to avoid direct overflight of the range safety
          area.
36WGI13-204 22 JULY 2011                                                                          47


          7.4.1.3.2. If air traffic conditions require direct overflight of the range safety area
          (i.e. HSC-25 search and rescue launch), contact range personnel (366-3215) to direct
          a cease-fire and provide an estimated cease fire duration time. Tower controllers will
          advise rotary wing aircraft upon notification of cease fire. Tower controllers will call
          back when conditions are safe to resume firing.
          7.4.1.3.3. Notify AMOPS (366-4188) prior to and immediately after all live fire
          operations.
          7.4.1.3.4. If the ATIS is operational, announce live fire operations are in progress.
       7.4.1.4. Administration. These procedures will be reviewed annually. Revisions may
       be initiated by either party when changing conditions and circumstances warrant.
       Additionally, this agreement is effective indefinitely, but may be terminated at any time
       by either 36 SFS/CC or 36 OSS/CC via mutual consent, or by written notification to the
       receiver at least 180 days in advance of proposed termination.
   7.4.2. For EOD Range Activities:
       7.4.2.1. 36 CES/CED will:
          7.4.2.1.1. Coordinate with AMOPS (366-4188) at least 72 hours in advance of any
          planned EOD detonations and as soon as possible for emergency detonations. EOD is
          responsible for providing AMOPS dimensions of affected airspace and duration of
          activity.
          7.4.2.1.2. Obtain permission from Tower (366-4737/4281) 30 minutes prior to
          exploding ordnance/activating the Andersen AFB EOD range and provide emergency
          contact number for activity termination.
          7.4.2.1.3. Verify permission from Tower 5 minutes prior to exploding
          ordnance/activating the Andersen AFB EOD range to ensure final approval.
          7.4.2.1.4. Advise Tower when the activated areas are no longer active.
       7.4.2.2. AMOPS will coordinate the issuance of a local NOTAM of proposed activity to
       include the area(s) affected, altitude clearance required, and date/time of occurrence.
       7.4.2.3. Tower will:
          7.4.2.3.1. Coordinate with Guam ARTCC and ensure affected airspace is clear of
          aircraft prior to granting permission for requested activity.
          7.4.2.3.2. Inform affected aircraft when areas are active and inform aircraft of
          airspace to avoid.
          7.4.2.3.3. Notify Guam ARTCC and AMOPS when activities are complete and areas
          are cold.

Watch Supervisor will ensure ATC participation does not degrade ATC services. The Tower
Watch Supervisor may interrupt or discontinue facility participation in any exercise if flight
safety is in question or it interferes with the recovery of emergency aircraft.
7.7. Exercise Scramble Procedures.
   7.7.1. Communications:
         7.7.1.1. Primary notification of an Air Defense Scramble with 13AF operations will be
         via Scramble Hotline. If/when the phone rings simply answer it “Tower” and wait for
         the message from “Jungle Ops”. Alternate notification will be via conference call (366-
         4737).
         7.7.1.2. Active scramble or practice scramble aircraft will use the pre-determined call-
         signs (TBD prior to exercise). The alert tanker (KC-130 or KC-135), if available, will
         also have a specific call-sign. All aircraft will adhere to normal departure procedures.
NOTE: These procedures shall apply to active/practice scrambles using the pre-determined call-
signs.
         7.7.1.3. Frequency 239.3 has been designated for air defense scramble operations and
         shall be monitored at all times during the exercise. This frequency will be used for
         issuing clearances and taxiing aircraft for departure unless otherwise coordinated.
         Frequency 269.5 shall be used as an alternate scramble frequency but will be used by
         GCI controllers for the ATCAA or intercept.
      7.7.2. Departure Procedures:
         7.7.2.1. Alert fighter aircraft, upon notification of ―Hot Scramble‖, will taxi via TWY F
         and depart RWY 06R, regardless of RWY in use. If RWY 06R is closed, alternate taxi
         routes will be provided for aircraft to depart RWY 06L.
         7.7.2.2. Approach and departure end runway arresting gear will be in the raised position
         for both runways. If unable to raise all four arresting gear the SOF will be notified.
         7.7.2.3. Once notified of a scramble, Tower shall clear all conflicting traffic from the
         area.
         7.7.2.4. Upon notification of taxi, Tower shall issue all pertinent airfield information and
         the following canned clearance based on prior approval/coordination with Guam ARTCC
         for participating aircraft:
“AIRCRAFT CALLSIGN, CLEARED TO ATCAA # AS FILED, SQUAWK ####”.
             7.7.2.4.1. Initial departure procedures not contained in the canned clearance are as
             follows:
                7.7.2.4.1.1. RWY 06R/L: ON DEPARTURE FLY HEADING ZERO SIX
                ZERO, CLIMB AND MAINTAIN NINER THOUSAND, EXPECT FL ###
                (exercise coordinated), 10 MINUTES AFTER DEPARTURE, DEPARTURE
                FREQUENCY 279.5 or 269.5 (pre-coordinated with Guam ARTCC), SQUAWK
                ####.‖
                7.7.2.4.1.2. RWY 24R/L: AT DEPARTURE END OF RUNWAY TURN
                RIGHT HEADING 260, CLIMB AND MAINTAIN NINER THOUSAND,
36WGI13-204 22 JULY 2011                                                                        49


               EXPECT FL ### (exercise coordinated), 10 MINUTES AFTER DEPARTURE,
               DEPARTURE FREQUENCY 279.5 or 269.5 (pre-coordinated with Guam
               ARTCC), SQUAWK ####.‖
       7.7.2.5. After the aircraft is cleared for take-off on the Local Control frequency (233.7),
       aircraft will be switched to departure frequency. Additional transmissions concerning
       safety of flight will be broadcast over frequency 243.0.
7.8. Supervisor of Flying (SOF) Operations in the Control Tower. SOFs serve as the 36
OG/CC representatives for flying related issues. The Tower watch supervisor (WS) serves as the
expert for ATC related issues. Together, the goal is to jointly assure a safe and efficient flow of
air traffic.
   7.8.1. Coordination:
       7.8.1.1. In order to provide an organized professional environment, all questions,
       directions and coordination must be accomplished directly between the SOF and Tower
       WS.
       7.8.1.2. The Tower WS or senior controller will keep the SOF advised of the current
       status of the runway, barriers, NAVAIDS, air traffic, and any other situations that may
       affect flying operations.
       7.8.1.3. The SOF will advise Tower WS of PIREP information received from aircrews
       and the WS will relay PIREP information to the SOF.
       7.8.1.4. The SOF’s callsign is ―Foxtrot‖.
   7.8.2. SOF Position Equipment (in Tower):
       7.8.2.1. SOF position equipment includes a VHF and UHF radio, NIPR/SIPR computer,
       direct lines and multiple line telephone.
       7.8.2.2. ATC may require use of the SOF multi-channel radios during equipment
       outages. Conversely, the SOF may also request use of Tower radios and telephones when
       necessary.
       7.8.2.3. The SOF shall relay all equipment outages to the WS, who will initiate repair
       actions. For any issue that is beyond the control of the WS; the SOF will contact the
       CCTLR or AOF/CC for resolution.
   7.8.3. Special Conditions and Emergencies:
       7.8.3.1. Whenever ATC becomes aware of an emergency aircraft intending to land at
       Andersen or local airfield, the SOF will be advised as soon as possible of all available
       information. Relaying information to the SOF, including emergency information, does
       not take priority over performance of required ATC duties.
       7.8.3.2. If the SOF declares an emergency or becomes aware of an aircraft experiencing
       an emergency, he/she will advise the Tower WS as soon as possible with all available
       information.
       7.8.3.3. With concurrence of the WS, the SOF may relay emergency information to
       aircraft through the Tower controllers. ATC will relay messages provided by the SOF
       verbatim and preface transmissions with, "SOF advises/directs.‖ When advice is
 50                                                              36WGI13-204 22 JULY 2011


       extremely technical, or when the SOF feels that relay of information by the controller
       could cause an unacceptable delay, the SOF may, after the approval of the WS,
       communicate directly with the aircraft involved on the ATC frequency. When this
       occurs, advisory instructions must be limited to that essential for the prevention of a
       mishap. At other times, such as a change in schedule, a change in alternate base, or other
       non-ATC matters, the aircraft will be instructed to contact the SOF on the SOF
       frequency. The SOF must not perform ATC functions or transmit ATC instructions or
       clearances to an aircraft. If a need for ATC instructions arises while aircraft are on SOF
       frequency, the SOF will immediately instruct the aircraft to return to the ATC frequency.
   7.8.4. SOF Access to Control Tower. The 36 OG representative will provide 36 OSS/OSA a
   validated EAL for SOF personnel. Only personnel listed on the EAL will be permitted
   unescorted access to the control tower.
   7.8.5. Use of Headsets. To reduce unnecessary noise levels that can lead to a possible
   hazardous situation, the SOF will use the ATC provided headset to the maximum extent
   possible to reduce noise during periods of local flying. The SOF should monitor control
   positions for traffic information, arrival/departure times, etc.
7.9. Night Vision Device (NVD) Operations. NVD operations conducted by HSC-25 will be
IAW HSC-25 and 36th OSS Letter of Agreement. All other NVD operations conducted at
Andersen AFB require 36 OG/CC pre-approval. Northwest Field is the preferred NVD training
area.
7.10. Parachute Jumping/Equipment Drop Procedures. All drops are conducted at the
operational unit’s own risk. All drops on Andersen AFB (Machete DZ) and North West Field’s
(NWF) (Fortress DZ) are conducted IAW the procedures outlined below. In addition to these
procedures the Aircraft Commander (AC) and Drop Zone Controller (DZC) have additional
requirements (see Attachments 18 and 19) which will be briefed by AMOPS prior to all airdrop
events.
   7.10.1. Procedures for Airborne Operations on Machete DZ:

                     DROP ZONE CONTROLLER REQUIREMENTS

A18.1. The DZC will report to Airfield Management Operations (Bldg. 17002) a minimum of 2
hours prior to DZ operations beginning. All DZ times will be verified and an LMR radio, if not
already obtained by DZ party, will be signed out. In addition, Airfield Management Operations
will provide a briefing on the following items as required:
   A18.1.1. Airfield Driving: All personnel operating a vehicle on the airfield will be provided
   training by Airfield Management Operations or designated representative. The briefing will
   include: designated route to and from DZ, airfield layout, speed limits, controlled movement
   area locations (to include critical areas and runways), airfield radio procedures, safety
   hazards, restricted areas, and location of perimeter roads.
   A18.1.2. DZ Security. The DZC is responsible for securing the DZ during airborne
   operation block times. Post drop zone signs and cones IAW Attachment 10 prior to DZ
   operations beginning. Ensure all signs and cones located at taxiway/runway intersections
   remain behind the runway holdline. All cones will be removed from the airfield upon
   completion of DZ operations.
   A18.1.3. Radio Communications: Coordinate with the Control Tower prior to conducting
   DZ operations and entering the controlled movement area. In the event jumpers land in an
   area other than the designated DZ, do not enter the controlled movement area without the
   Control Tower’s approval. The DZC is responsible for ensuring all personnel supporting the
   DZ operation are under their control at all times. ATC UHF/VHF frequencies will not be
   used for coordinating between aircrew and DZC. Such use is in violation of Federal Aviation
   Administration and USAF ATC policies. Maintain strict radio discipline as the assigned
   LMR radio frequency is used by several other base agencies.
   A18.1.4. Reporting Incidents: Any damage or irregular incident that occurs while
   conducting DZ operations will be reported to Airfield Management Operations immediately
   by the most direct means available (radio, telephone, etc.). Failure to report such an incident
   may terminate future operations on the airfield.
A18.2. DZC will conduct a thorough FOD check upon completion of paradrop operations.
Ensure all jumpers and DZ support personnel have accounted for all gear and equipment. Report
the approximate location of any lost items to Airfield Management Operations, so an immediate
check can be conducted to ensure no FOD hazards exist for aircraft operations.
A18.3. Report to Airfield Management Operations when operations are complete. Return all
cones, signs, and radios as necessary.

                         PARADROP AIRCREW REQUIREMENTS

A19.1. Aircrews shall make compulsory reports at 10, 5, and 1-minute prior to jump, as well as
when jumpers are away. The 10-minute call is mandatory even when aircraft are not in
Andersen’s Class D airspace. The 10-minute call begins the sterilization of the Andersen’s Area
A of the Class Delta (Attachment 19) and deactivation of the CATM range. (call may be direct to
tower or passed through Guam ARTCC if on frequency with them).
A19.2. At ten minutes prior to jump, tower shall advise all nonparticipating airborne and ground
traffic, ―JUMPERS AWAY IN ONE ZERO MINUTES‖ and require nonparticipating aircraft to
depart the Class D airspace or taxi to parking and shut down all engines/rotors.
A19.3. At five minutes prior to jump, tower shall advise all nonparticipating airborne and
ground traffic, ―JUMPERS AWAY IN FIVE MINUTES.‖
A19.4. At one minute prior to jump, tower shall advise the jump aircraft of any aircraft still in
the Class D airspace or of any aircraft still on the ground that has not reported engine shut down.
The jump aircraft, jumpmaster, and/or Drop Zone Control Officer shall make the final
determination whether or not to release jumpers.
A19.5. ATC frequencies will not be used for coordination between aircrew and drop zone
controllers. Such use is a violation of Federal Aviation Administration and USAF ATC policies.
A19.6. Tower shall advise all nonparticipating aircraft of the termination of parachute jumping
and resumption of normal operations.
A19.7. Tower Watch Supervisor has the authority to deviate from these procedures as needed in
the interest of flight safety.
