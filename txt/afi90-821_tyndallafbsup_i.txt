This Air Force Instruction (AFI) implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 90-8,
Environmental, Safety and Occupational Health Program. It describes the Air Force Hazard
Communication (HAZCOM) Program that puts into effect the requirements of the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Hazard Communication Standard 29 CFR 1910.1200
for the Air Force. All records created as a result of this publication must be maintained and
disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at

                                           Chapter 1

                                      INTRODUCTION

Section 1A—Overview

1.1. Purpose. Hazardous chemicals are found in virtually every Air Force operation, including
aircraft and missile maintenance, civil engineering, transportation, supply, medical, and support
functions. This AFI is intended to minimize the incidence of chemically induced occupational
illnesses and injuries in the workplace by establishing guidance for training employees on the
health and physical hazards associated with, and proper preventive measures to be taken when,
using or handling hazardous chemicals in work area/shop(s). This program is commonly referred
to as the Hazard Communication (HAZCOM) Program, and is not to be confused with other
separate and distinct entities such as Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response
(HAZWOPER) and the Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) Management Program (HMMP).
HAZCOM is a performance-based program with separate training requirements and successful
implementation can only be measured by evaluating worker awareness of work area/shop
hazards.
1.2. Scope.
   1.2.1. This AFI provides the requirements for an effective Air Force HAZCOM Program for
   those work area/shop(s) that have workers that handle or use hazardous chemicals. All
   employees that work in an environment where any chemical is known to be present in such a
   manner that employees may be exposed under normal conditions of use or in a foreseeable
   emergency, will be provided information about the hazardous chemicals to which they are
   exposed. This information shall be provided by means of a hazard communication program,
   including but not limited to material safety data sheets (MSDSs), labels, and other forms of
   warning, and information [e.g. AF Form 3952, Chemical/Hazardous Material
   Request/Authorization Forms, Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE) shop survey letters] and
   training.
   1.2.2. This AFI applies to:
       1.2.2.1. All U.S. Air Force military and civilian personnel, direct-hire foreign nationals,
       and indirect-hire foreign employees at Air Force installations within the Continental
       United States (CONUS), or its territories, GOCOs, GSUs, and in foreign countries as
       established in accordance with the applicable Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA).
       1.2.2.2. The Air Force Reserves, the Air National Guard, and direct reporting units
       (DRU) and field operating agencies (FOA) not located on Air Force installations.
       1.2.2.3. All Air Force military and civilian personnel who use, handle, or may be
       potentially exposed to chemical hazards while working under a contractor or working in
       contractor facilities. Where feasible, Air Force personnel may be included in the
       contractor’s Federal compliant hazard communication program. The Air Force retains
       ultimate responsibility for Air Force personnel participation and oversight.
 6                                           AFI90-821_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 11 JULY 2012


        1.2.2.4. Contractor employees who are employed at Air Force-owned or operated
        facilities when authorized by the Contracting Officer in coordination with BE with the
        following exceptions:
            1.2.2.4.1. This AFI does not excuse contractors, as stipulated in their specific
            contracts, from their compliance obligations under OSHA’s Federal HAZCOM
            regulation or any applicable State and local requirements.
            1.2.2.4.2. Contractors are required to train their own employees in accordance with
            Federal HAZCOM and any applicable State and local requirements. Contractors are
            not authorized to use the AF HAZCOM Program for this purpose.
     1.2.3. The Federal HAZCOM Standard has primacy over state programs at Air Force
     installations even if the state has an OSHA-approved state program.
     1.2.4. Materials exempted from this standard are listed under the Hazard Communication
     Program description contained in Para. 2.2.
     1.2.5. In work operations such as warehousing where employees only handle chemicals in
     sealed containers which are not opened under normal conditions of use, this instruction
     applies to these operations only as follows:
        1.2.5.1. Supervisors will ensure labels on incoming containers of hazardous chemicals
        are not removed or defaced.
        1.2.5.2. MSDSs received with incoming shipments of sealed containers will be
        maintained, and employees will have access to the MSDSs. If hazardous chemicals
        received do not have MSDSs, they will be obtained as soon as possible.
        1.2.5.3. Supervisors will train employees on the hazards of the chemicals in their work
        area/shop, and to the extent necessary to protect them in the event of a spill or leak of a
        hazardous chemical from a sealed container.

                                          Chapter 2

                        HAZARD COMMUNICATION PROGRAM

2.1. Introduction. AF HAZCOM program requirements apply to any chemical hazard, except
as stated in Para. 2.2 below, known to be present in work area/shop(s) in such a manner
employees may be exposed under normal conditions of use or in a foreseeable emergency.
   2.1.1. (Added-TYNDALLAFBSUP) Supervisors are primarily responsible for all aspects
   of their workplace HAZCOM program, and they are also responsible for monitoring the
   effectiveness of that program. This can be done in several ways such as observation of work
   practices and questioning of personnel. A self inspection checklist is at Attachment 4,
   Hazard Communication Workplace Self Inspection Checklist, for workplace supervisors to
   monitor their programs. In addition to the supervisor monitoring the effectiveness of the
   HAZCOM program, BE will also monitor the effectiveness/compliance of the shop’s
   HAZCOM program during their routine industrial hygiene assessments. At that time, BE
   will work with the supervisor to correct any discrepancies or findings identified during these
   assessments.
   2.1.2. (Added-TYNDALLAFBSUP) Workplace supervisors will develop and maintain a
   workplace HAZCOM binder using the recommended format outlined in Attachment 5,
   Workplace Hazard Communication Program Binder Template. The purpose of this binder is
   to promote standardization across Tyndall AFB and to assist supervisors in ensuring their
   programs contain all necessary information. This binder should be frequently reviewed to
   maintain currency.
2.2. Materials Exempt from the AF HAZCOM Program. AF HAZCOM program
requirements do not apply to the following.
   2.2.1. Hazardous wastes regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
   (RCRA).
   2.2.2. Hazardous substances subject to a remedial action or removal action under the
   Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA).
   2.2.3. Tobacco or tobacco products.
   2.2.4. Wood or wood products that will not be processed.
   2.2.5. Articles. An article is a manufactured item other than fluid or particle: (1) which is
   formed to a specific shape or design during manufacture; (2) which has end-use function(s)
   dependent in whole or in part upon its shape or design during end use; and (3) which under
   normal conditions of use does not release more than very small quantities, e.g., minute or
   trace amounts of hazardous chemicals [as determined under 29 CFR 1910.1200(d)], and does
   not pose a physical hazard or health risk to employees.
   2.2.6. Food or alcoholic beverages.
   2.2.7. Drugs in final form [such as non-prescription and prescription, dry pelletized drugs,
   e.g., pills or caplets].
   2.2.8. Cosmetics.
 14                                         AFI90-821_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 11 JULY 2012


   2.2.9. Consumer products in normal consumer use such as vehicle propane tanks, copier
   toner, etc (i.e., material usage in the workplace is for the purpose intended by the chemical
   manufacturer or importer of the product, and the use results in a duration and frequency of
   exposure which is not greater than the range of exposures that could reasonably be
   experienced by consumers when used for the purpose intended).
       2.2.9.1. Whether consumer product materials are subject to the AF HAZCOM program
       and require training requires a case-by-case judgment by the supervisor in consultation
       with BE. For example:
           2.2.9.1.1. Personnel who use window cleaner fluid to clean infrequently will not
           require this training; however, maintenance personnel using the same window cleaner
           daily will require training.
           2.2.9.1.2. Patrons using automotive cleaners at the auto skills center will not require
           training; however, auto skills center employees and LRS transportation personnel
           using the same cleaner as part of their job will require training.
   2.2.10. Nuisance particulates such as copier toner.
   2.2.11. Ionizing and non-ionizing radiation.
   2.2.12. Biological hazards.
   2.2.13. Munitions as defined in AFI 32-7086, Hazardous Materials Management.
2.3. Installation Written Hazard Communication Program. Each Air Force installation
whose employees will potentially be exposed to hazardous materials not exempted as described
in Para. 2.2 must create a written hazard communication program to support work area/shop
implementation of the HAZCOM program. The written program must include installation-
specific procedures to meet the HAZCOM program requirements and specifically, will include:
   2.3.1. How MSDSs are accessible to employees (see Para. 2.5).
   2.3.2. Container labeling procedures and requirements (see Para. 2.6).
   2.3.3. Training requirements and procedures (see Para. 2.7).
   2.3.4. Chemical inventory requirements (see Para. 2.8).
   2.3.5. Procedures for informing employees regarding hazards of non-routine tasks and
   unlabeled pipes (see Para. 2.9).
   2.3.6. Procedures for determining the hazard of a chemical (See Para. 2.4; applies to only
   work area/shops which produce hazardous chemicals).
2.4. Hazard Determination: The Air Force will rely on the hazard determination of the
supplier or manufacturer of purchased chemicals. For Air Force produced chemicals, the Air
Force activity controlling the formulation will make the hazard determination and produce an
MSDS IAW 29 CFR 1910.1200. The Air Force activity producing the chemical will include
hazard determination procedures in their written program, and ensure their personnel are trained
on the hazards. If the chemical is transferred to any other organizations, the producing
organization will provide a MSDS with the shipment and transmit the MSDS to AFIOH.
AFI90-821_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                                        15


2.5. Material Safety Data Sheets. Each MSDS is a detailed information bulletin prepared by
the chemical manufacturer describing the physical and chemical properties, physical and health
hazards, routes of exposure, precautions for safe handling and use, emergency and first-aid
procedures, and control measures of the listed hazardous chemicals. The MSDS shall be
prepared to be consistent with 29 CFR 1910.1200(g) requirements. OCONUS locations will
maintain documents consistent with 29 CFR 1910.1200(g). If a document consistent with 29
CFR 1910.1200(g) cannot be obtained from the OCONUS supplier, a document meeting the
intent of 29 CFR 1910.1200(g) is acceptable.
   2.5.1. An MSDS must be immediately accessible (in either paper or electronic format) for
   every item on the work area/shop-specific hazardous chemical inventory. The MSDS on file
   must match the manufacturer and part number/trade name of the material on-hand. In
   addition, the MSDS preparation date must be consistent with the date/lot of any material on-
   hand. If a new MSDS is received, but the old material is still on-hand, the MSDS, which
   matched the old material, must be retained.
   2.5.2. MSDSs may be obtained from several sources. These include, but are not limited to,
   the chemical manufacturer or supplier, installation or unit HAZMART, DoD HMIRS on-line
   or CD-ROM, or through the ESOH-MIS. If the MSDS is not available from these sources,
   the BE Flight may be contacted for further assistance.
   2.5.3. Access to MSDSs in the work area/shops will be provided as follows:
       2.5.3.1. All workers on all shifts must know how to obtain an MSDS, and have
       unrestricted direct access to MSDSs for their work area/shop during all shifts.
       2.5.3.2. MSDSs may be maintained in the work area/shops in paper or electronic version.
       OSHA does not specifically prohibit any form of access as long as "no barriers to
       immediate employee access" are created.
       2.5.3.3. The location of MSDSs and/or means of access for any work area/shop will be
       determined locally. The supervisor should consider how long it would take for a worker
       to obtain an MSDS if it were needed to respond to a spill or if a worker was accidentally
       splashed with a hazardous chemical.
       2.5.3.4. If the primary means for MSDS access is electronic, a back-up system for MSDS
       access must be established in case primary computer access is disrupted. The back-up
       system may include, but is not limited to, paper copies, local computer files or CDs at
       another non-impacted location, telephone, fax, or access through a nearby HAZMART or
       BE Flight. Local judgment must be used to determine an adequate back-up system on a
       case-by-case basis.
       2.5.3.5. BE or other qualified personnel will provide explanations or interpretations of
       the MSDS to supervisors and affected workers, as requested, for routine training and
       planning, and will be available during emergency situations to assist in interpretation of
       MSDSs.
       2.5.3.6. Where personnel must travel between work area/shops during a work shift (e.g.,
       their work is carried out at more than one geographical location such as flight line
       operations), the MSDS may be kept at the primary work area/shop facility. In this
 16                                        AFI90-821_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 11 JULY 2012


      situation, the supervisor shall ensure that personnel can immediately obtain the required
      information in an emergency.
   2.5.4. Ensure any proprietary formulary and/or trade secret information in an MSDS is
   protected and used only as a management tool for exposure and incident prevention or health
   hazard education. During the acquisition process, the Bioenvironmental Engineer (BEE) will
   discuss trade-secret limitations with the work area/shop supervisor; however, supervisors
   using materials with trade-secret information are encouraged to be familiar with requirements
   and restrictions listed in 29 CFR 1910.1200(i). When requesting proprietary information, the
   BEE may be asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement regarding a manufacturer’s
   proprietary information; consult with Legal Services in non-disclosure criteria are not clear.
2.6. Labels and Other Forms of Warning.
   2.6.1. Labeling of hazardous chemical containers will be done according to 29 CFR
   1910.1200(f), and DoDI 6050.5-H, DoD Hazardous Chemical Warning Labeling System.
   2.6.2. It is the responsibility of chemical manufacturers, importers and commercial
   distributors to label containers of hazardous chemicals according to the OSHA’s Federal
   HAZCOM standard. Accordingly, chemical containers entering the installation through the
   supply system or through local purchase should already be labeled. Supply receiving and
   HAZMARTs will ensure incoming containers are properly labeled. Supply receiving and
   HAZMARTS will submit an item discrepancy report to identify any containers received
   without proper labeling from the manufacturer.
   2.6.3. Materials exempted from HAZCOM labeling requirements are described as follows
   [See 29 CFR 1910.1200(b)(5) if additional details are desired]:
      2.6.3.1. Any pesticide as such term is defined in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and
      Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) when subject to the labeling requirements of that Act.
      2.6.3.2. Any chemical substance or mixture as such terms are defined in the Toxic
      Substances Control Act (TSCA) when subject to the labeling requirements of that Act.
      2.6.3.3. Any food, food additive, color additive, drug, cosmetic, or medical or veterinary
      device or product, including materials intended for use as ingredients in such products
      (e.g., flavors and fragrances), as such terms are defined in the Federal Food, Drug, and
      Cosmetic Act.
      2.6.3.4. Any distilled spirits (beverage alcohols), wine, or malt beverage intended for
      non-industrial use, as such terms are defined in the Federal Alcohol Administration Act,
      and regulations issued under that Act, when subject to the labeling requirements of that
      Act and labeling regulations issued under that Act by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
      and Firearms.
      2.6.3.5. Any consumer product or hazardous substance as those terms are defined in the
      Consumer Product Safety Act and Federal Hazardous Substances Act respectively, when
      subject to a consumer product safety standard or labeling requirement of those Acts, or
      regulations issued under those Acts by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
      2.6.3.6. Agricultural or vegetable seed treated with pesticides and labeled in accordance
      with the Federal Seed Act and labeling regulations issued under that Act by the
      Department of Agriculture.
AFI90-821_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                                          17


   2.6.4. Supervisors will ensure labels on containers of hazardous chemicals used in their work
   area/shop meet HAZCOM requirements, remain affixed to their containers, and are not
   obliterated or covered. At minimum, the following information will appear on container
   labels [refer to 29 CFR 1910.1200(f)(6) for alternate means]:
      2.6.4.1. The identity of the hazardous chemical(s) in the container.
      2.6.4.2. Appropriate hazard warnings that include information about the specific physical
      and health hazard(s), including target organ effects of the chemical(s) in the container.
      This may be accomplished using any combination of words, symbols, or pictures.
   2.6.5. Installation HAZMARTs may affix other labels to containers for locally determined
   purposes. If the HAZMART label duplicates the Federal HAZCOM standard requirements,
   the original label may be covered. If the HAZMART label does not duplicate the
   information required by the Federal HAZCOM standard, information on the original label
   must remain legible.
   2.6.6. Transfer of chemicals between containers.
      2.6.6.1. If an employee transfers a chemical from a labeled container (for example, a 55-
      gallon drum) into a portable container for the immediate use of the same employee who
      made the transfer, then the portable container does not need to be labeled according to
      HAZCOM requirements. Immediate use means that the hazardous chemical will be
      under the control of and used only by the person who transfers it from a labeled container
      and only within the work shift in which it is transferred. If the employee cannot maintain
      full control over the chemical or departs the work area/shop, and if there is residual
      material left in the portable container, this material shall either be disposed of under
      applicable local disposal regulations, returned to its original container, or labeled in
      accordance with applicable regulations.
      2.6.6.2. If a chemical is transferred from a labeled container into a portable container at a
      central distribution point, such as the installation or unit HAZMART, for use by other
      employees, then the portable container must be labeled by the HAZMART in accordance
      with HAZCOM requirements.
2.7. Employee Information and Training. The work area/shop supervisor is responsible for
ensuring all workers are properly trained on the chemical hazards in their work area/shop.
   2.7.1. Purpose. Supervisors and employees who handle, use, or are potentially exposed to
   hazardous materials in the course of official Air Force duties must be provided training on
   the AF HAZCOM program, including training to address work area/shop-specific hazards
   prior to the use of hazardous chemicals. Supervisors will ensure the appropriate functionals
   (i.e., PH, BE, base safety office, and fire department) review and approve the shop specific
   hazard training program for technical accuracy and completeness prior to implementation in
   the work area/shop. Contract supervisors and contractors shall be trained according to their
   specific contract provisions.
      2.7.1.1. (Added-TYNDALLAFBSUP) A template shop specific training program is at
      Attachment 6, Shop Specific Hazard Training Plan Template. The Shop Specific Hazard
      Training Template includes Attachment 7, Definitions, Attachment 8, Warning Labels,
      Attachment 9, HMIS Labels, and Attachment 10, HMIS Labels. This template was
18                                         AFI90-821_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 11 JULY 2012


     created by BE, PH, Base Safety, and the Fire Dept to address the requirement in AFI 90-
     821, para 2.7.1
     2.7.1.2. (Added-TYNDALLAFBSUP) The Template Training Program may also be
     downloaded from the Tyndall AFB Bioenvironmental Engineering CoP.
  2.7.2. Hazard Communication Training. Workers will be provided HAZCOM training prior
  to working with a material that could potentially create a health hazard, and when work
  area/shop conditions or hazardous materials change.
     2.7.2.1. Initial Training. Workers will receive comprehensive HAZCOM training from
     their supervisors at the time of their initial assignment in a work area/shop. This training,
     at a minimum, will include the following:
         2.7.2.1.1. Identification of operations or processes in the work area/shop where
         hazardous chemicals are present or used, and the complete list of hazardous material
         used in association with work area/shop processes.
         2.7.2.1.2. Identification of relevant hazard categories associated with each chemical
         used (e.g., flammability, carcinogenicity, etc.) or the individual chemical hazards;
         including, but not limited to, those with specific regulatory requirements (e.g.,
         asbestos, benzene, beryllium, cadmium, formaldehyde, and lead).
         2.7.2.1.3. The location and contents of the work area/shop-specific written hazard
         communication program.
         2.7.2.1.4. Proper labeling of hazardous materials.
         2.7.2.1.5. How to access and read MSDSs.
         2.7.2.1.6. Controls (engineering controls, administrative controls, and personal
         protective equipment) workers must use to minimize or eliminate exposure to
         hazardous chemicals specific to a task (e.g., the specific respirator for a specific spray
         painting process). Supervisors shall refer to the installation BE work area/shop
         survey reports for specific control requirements.
         2.7.2.1.7. Emergency procedures, such as recognition of a spill or accidental
         chemical release (e.g., visual, odor, alarm) and escape procedures to include the
         locations of emergency eye wash stations, showers, and monitoring capabilities.
         2.7.2.1.8. Chemical hazards associated with non-routine tasks (e.g., solvent tank
         change-out every three months).
     2.7.2.2. Supplemental Training. Training for all potentially affected employees is
     required when either a new hazard is brought into the work area/shop or a new chemical
     is introduced. The training shall include all elements described in Para. 2.7.2.
     Supervisors may use the AF Form 3952 or BE special survey letters as sources of
     information to meet this training requirement. When workers change work area/shops
     either by assigned duties or location, work area/shop-specific training as described in
     Para. 2.7.2.1 will be re-accomplished only to the extent needed to cover changes in
     working conditions and potential exposures.
  2.7.3. Activities Not Co-located. Air Force employees assigned to non-co-located activities,
  such as GOCO facilities, will be trained as GSUs (see Para. 2.7) or they may participate in
AFI90-821_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                                        19


   that GOCO’s or other Services’ hazard communication training program, as long as the
   training meets the requirements of the Federal HAZCOM standard.
   2.7.4. Documentation of Hazard Communication Training. While the Federal HAZCOM
   standard does not require documentation of worker training, the Air Force, in accordance
   with AFI 91-301, as a good management practice, requires work area/shop supervisors to
   document both worker initial and supplemental hazard communication training on AF Form
   55 or in CAMS or in ESOH-MIS. This record should also include external HAZCOM
   training provided to AF supervisors and employees from contractor organizations where
   applicable.
   2.7.5. Determining the Effectiveness of Hazard Communication Training. HAZCOM is a
   performance-based standard. Therefore, the effectiveness of worker training will be
   measured by assessing worker knowledge of basic hazard communication concepts to
   include, but not be limited to:
      2.7.5.1. What processes and chemicals present hazards in their work area/shop and the
      nature of the hazard.
      2.7.5.2. How to access MSDSs for any chemical they use.
      2.7.5.3. How to find information on an MSDS.
      2.7.5.4. How to interpret the hazard symbols or wording on hazard labels and what
      precautions (e.g., engineering controls, personal protective equipment, etc.) they must use
      when working with hazardous chemicals.
   2.7.6. (Added-TYNDALLAFBSUP) BE will determine the effectiveness of HAZCOM
   training for industrial workplaces during their routine occupational health assessments. BE
   will randomly question workplace personnel on concepts that should be addressed in the
   workplace specific written HAZCOM program and feedback will be provided in the
   assessment report. For administrative workplaces or workplaces not visited by the BEF on a
   routine basis, an assessment of their HAZCOM program, to include training, can be
   requested.
2.8. Hazardous Chemical Inventory.
   2.8.1. The written work area/shop hazard communication program must include a list of the
   hazardous chemicals known to be present in a work area/shop (the list may be compiled for
   the work area/shop as a whole or for specified and readily distinguishable portions of a work
   area/shop). The identity that is used on the MSDS must be cross-referenced to the inventory.
   Where accessible, the inventory may be maintained in the ESOH-MIS.
   2.8.2. The inventory is a fundamental building block for a HAZCOM program and the
   nature of the chemicals on the inventory in a work area/shop will determine the scope of the
   hazard communication program and training requirements appropriate for that work
   area/shop. NOTE: IAW AFI 32-7086, the IHMP, through the AF Form 3952 authorization
   process, controls which hazardous chemicals can be used in each work area/shop on an
   installation.
   2.8.3. (Added-TYNDALLAFBSUP) If the workplace has access to the AF Standardized
   Hazardous Materials Tracking System, this can be obtained by printing out a copy of the
   Authorized Users List (AUL) or Chemical Authorization List for the work area. If the
 20                                        AFI90-821_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 11 JULY 2012


   workplace does not have direct access to the AF standardized hazardous materials tracking
   system, they can contact their Unit Environmental Coordinator (UEC) for assistance.
2.9. Non-Routine Tasks Involving Hazardous Materials.
   2.9.1. Non-routine tasks are:
       2.9.1.1. Those tasks included within a work area/shop’s normal activities but performed
       infrequently, for example, cleaning a solvent tank and changing the solvent.
       2.9.1.2. Temporary duties outside an individual’s normal Air Force Specialty Code
       (AFSC) or job series.
   2.9.2. Supervisors will ensure work area/shop operating instructions (OI), specific task lists,
   and Job Safety Analyses (JSAs) thoroughly describe non-routine tasks, associated hazards,
   and controls, for the infrequent tasks covered under Para. 2.9.1. OIs do not need to be
   prepared if technical orders (TO) or other official documents adequately describe these tasks
   and associated hazards and controls. Supervisors will ensure workers review these
   procedures before performing the non-routine tasks.
   2.9.3. When workers temporarily perform duties outside their normal jobs, the supervisor of
   the gaining activity will ensure these workers receive the following training prior to
   beginning the activity:
       2.9.3.1. The initial HAZCOM training described in Para. 2.7.2.1 for workers not
       previously trained.
       2.9.3.2. Work area/shop-specific training, as necessary, on work area/shop-specific
       chemical hazards and associated controls.
2.10. Contractors in AF Work Area/Shop(s). When an Air Force work area/shop uses
hazardous chemicals in a way that contractor employees (e.g., a painting contractor working in
an industrial shop) may be exposed, then the work area/shop written hazard communication
program and access to MSDSs must be provided to the contractors in accordance with 29 CFR
1910.1200(e)(2). The contractor is responsible to determine the adequacy of the HAZCOM
information for assessments of contractor employees, and is responsible for their own HAZCOM
program.
2.11. Forms Prescribed. Air Force Form 55 (AF55), Employee Safety and Health Record; Air
Force Form 3952 (AF3952), Chemical/Hazardous Material Request/Authorization Form.

2.11. (TYNDALLAFBSUP) Forms Prescribed. Tyndall AFB IMT 81, Contractors Hazardous

     WORKPLACE HAZARD COMMUNICATION PROGRAM BINDER TEMPLATE

Tab A: Workplace Specific HAZCOM Program Operating Instruction. This tab must contain the
workplace specific HAZCOM Program Operating Instruction. This OI will cover how the workplace
will further implement the program and provide additional employee information and training.

Tab B: AFI 90-821. Supervisors should maintain a copy of this instruction (cross reference to location
if not maintained in binder).

Tab C: AFI 90-821 TYNDALL Supplement. This instruction serves as the installation written
HAZCOM program and IAW AFI 90-821 must be included in the workplace specific written
HAZCOM program.

Tab D: Bioenvironmental Engineering Industrial Hygiene Assessment Reports. These reports
provide the shop information on hazards present within the workplace and control measures
recommended to mitigate those hazards such as personal protective equipment (PPE). If assessed
routinely, IAW AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, the workplace must
maintain on file copies of all reports received over the past 2 years (at a minimum). Also, IAW AFI 91-
202, supervisors must post the report on the workplace bulletin board for a period of 10 days after

                       SHOP SPECIFIC HAZARD TRAINING PLAN

This template provides work centers with a format to write their Shop Specific Hazard Training
Plan. While it is not required that this template is used, it is required that the work center’s
Shop Specific Hazard Training Plan include all items addressed in AFI 90-821, Hazardous
Communication, section 2.7. Additionally, all Shop Specific Hazard Training Plans must be
reviewed and approved through Public Health (PH), Bioenvironmental Engineering (BEE),
Wing Safety office, and the Tyndall Fire & Emergency Services.



INSTRUCTIONAL GUIDANCE:

This instruction must be filled in by each individual work center to serve its intended purpose.
Stress proper use of Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)’s, controls, and Personal Protective
Equipment (PPE). Hazard Communication (HAZCOM) Program training will be documented
on the AF Forms 55, or in the Core Automated Maintenance System (CAMS) or the AF ESOH-
MIS as Supervisors Federal Hazard Communication Training Program (Supervisors FHCTP),
Initial Federal Hazard Communication Training Program (Initial FHCTP), and Supplemental
Federal Hazard Communication Training Program (Supplemental FHCTP).

Terms:

(Supervisors FHCTP) -- Supervisors Federal Hazard Communication Training Program - This
training is required for all supervisors and designated program alternates in the work center. The
slide presentation serves as supervisor safety training. Once this training is documented,
supervisors can administer/oversee training to the remainder of individuals. Two (2) supervisors
or alternates must be designated as HAZCOM program managers because individual shops are
responsible for creating/training on a Workplace-Specific HAZCOM Training Plan. Training can
be found at the PH website.

(Initial FHCTP) -- Initial Federal Hazard Communication Training Program - This serves as
initial training for individuals that are not supervisors. The Workplace-Specific HAZCOM
Training Plan must be used for training in addition to the Initial FHCTP.

(Supplemental FHCTP) -- Supplemental Federal Hazard Communication Training Program -
Training for all potentially affected employees is required when either a new hazard is brought
into the work area/shop or a new chemical is introduced. Again, the Workplace-Specific
HAZCOM Training Plan must be used for training and should be updated as appropriate.
AFI90-821_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                                        31


     ********************START BRIEFING FROM HERE********************

1. PURPOSE:

    1.1. Your Rights; by Law: Under Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1910,
Subpart 1200, or "29 CFR 1910.1200," you have the right, and are required, to receive
information and training regarding the hazardous chemicals that you handle or are exposed to.
This information and training is the “Hazard Communication Program”, commonly referred to
as HAZCOM. You may also hear it referred to as the “Right-to-Know” program. This program
deals specifically with your supervisor informing you of the hazardous chemicals within your
workplace and providing to you the training required to safely work with and around those
chemicals before you are exposed to them.

      1.2. The Department of Defense Federal Hazard Communication Training you are about
to receive addresses the chemicals you will be exposed to, established protective measures, and
how to find the information needed to protect yourself. You can expect to receive some aspect
of this program for as long as you work with or around hazardous materials.

      1.3. Your Responsibilities: Under AFI 90-821, you have specific responsibilities. You are
required to follow the training you are given, comply with PPE requirements, including their use,
inspection and care, and give due consideration to personal safety and the safety of fellow
workers.

     1.4. Methods of Recourse: If you feel you have not received information, which you need
and have a right to under the Hazard Communication Program, talk to your supervisor.

2. OBJECTIVES: Enable (Type the name of the shop) shop personnel to identify hazardous
chemicals used in their respective work areas and the precautions to take during hazardous
chemical use.

3. INITIAL WORKPLACE SPECIFIC TRAINING: Workers will receive comprehensive
HAZCOM training prior to working with a material that could potentially create a health hazard,
and when work area/shop conditions or hazardous materials change. The supervisor will
maintain records on the AF Forms 55, or in the Core Automated Maintenance System (CAMS)
or the AF ESOH-MIS.

4. OPERATIONS/TASKS IN THE WORKPLACE INVOLVING HAZARDOUS
CHEMICALS:

The most recent BEE Industrial Hygiene (IH) survey will specify which chemical hazards are in
different processes in the Process Summary Table. Use your chemical inventory (EESOH-MIS
Report) and the Process Summary Table to brief what chemicals are used in the specific
processes performed in the work center.
 32                                          AFI90-821_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 11 JULY 2012


5. IDENTIFICATION OF HAZARD CATEGORIES ASSOCIATED WITH EACH
CHEMICAL USE OR THE INDIVIDUAL CHEMICAL HAZARD:

    5.1. Read materials safety data sheets and brief information on the hazard category
(flammable, carcinogen, etc). Definitions are included in attachment 1.

   5.2. Brief chemicals with specific regulatory requirement (e.g. asbestos, benzene, beryllium,
cadmium, formaldehyde and lead):

      5.2.1. The most recent BEE IH survey will specify chemicals with regulatory training
requirements in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Expanded
Standards section. Chemicals that require specific training are: (Type in all chemicals that
require specific training. If there isn’t an OSHA Expanded Standards section or it
specifically says training is not required in the OSHA Expanded Standards section of the
most recent BEE IH survey, type in none)

     5.2.2. Required Lesson plans can be found at the Bioenvironmental Engineering website.
Additional questions can be answered by Bioenvironmental Engineering or Public Health.

    5.2.3. OSHA expanded standard training (list each individual chemical) must be
documented on the AF Forms 55, or in the Core Automated Maintenance System (CAMS) or the
AF ESOH-MIS. Training must be done at the frequency specified in the BEE IH survey.

6. INDICATE THE LOCATION AND CONTENTS OF THE WORK AREA/SHOP-
SPECIFIC WRITTEN HAZARD COMMUNICATION PROGRAM. Refer to HAZCOM
Binder Table of Contents.

7. LABELING:

   7.1. To ensure employees are aware of all hazardous materials within their workplace,
OSHA requires all containers of hazardous materials brought into or used within a workplace to
have the contents labeled, tagged or marked on the container(s).

     7.1.1. The chemical manufacturer, importer or distributor is required to label, tag or mark
each container with:

         7.1.1.1. The identity of the hazardous material.

         7.1.1.2. Appropriate hazard warnings that include information about the specific
physical and health hazard(s), including target organ effects of the chemical(s) in the container.
This may be accomplished using any combination of words, symbols, or pictures.

         7.1.1.3. Name and address of the manufacturer, importer or distributor.
AFI90-821_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                                         33


         7.1.2. These labels, tags or markings will not be removed, defaced or changed. If it
becomes necessary to replace a label, tag or marking due to damaged or loss, DD Form 2522 (4‖
x 6‖), Hazardous Chemical Warning Label, or suitable substitute will be used (Attachment 8).
These forms will also be used to meet the labeling requirements of existing stocks of unraveled
materials and for transferring, repackaging or distributing of bulk quantities of hazardous
materials into other containers (breakdown quantities). Other warning labels are provided in
attachments 9 and 10.

7.2. Small quantity containers:

           7.2.1. If an employee transfers a chemical from a labeled container (for example, a 55-
gallon drum) into a portable container for the immediate use of the same employee who made the
transfer, then the portable container does not need to be labeled according to HAZCOM
requirements. Immediate use means that the hazardous chemical will be under the control of and
used only by the person who transfers it from a labeled container and only within the work shift
in which it is transferred. If the employee cannot maintain full control over the chemical or
departs the work area/shop, and if there is residual material left in the portable container, this
material shall either be disposed of under applicable local disposal regulations, returned to its
original container, or labeled in accordance with applicable regulations.

         7.2.2. Portable containers which do not meet the requirements in section 7.2.1 and
secondary containers, such as solvent tanks, must be labeled in accordance with above standards.

8. MATERIAL SAFETY DATA SHEETS:

   8.1. Materials safety data sheets are designed to help you understand how to work safely
with chemicals in your work area.

   8.2. 29 CFR 1910.1200 requires the following items be addressed in ’materials safety data
sheets:

     - The identity used on the label;

     - Physical and chemical characteristics of the hazardous chemical(s);

     - The physical hazards of the hazardous chemical including the potential for fire, explosion
     and reactivity;

     - The health hazards of the hazardous chemical including signs and symptoms of exposure,
     and any medical conditions which are generally recognized as being aggravated by
     exposure to the chemical;

     - The primary route(s) of entry;
 34                                           AFI90-821_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 11 JULY 2012


      - OSHA permissible exposure limits, American Conference of Governmental Industrial
      Hygienists (ACGIH) Threshold Limit Value, and any other exposure limit used or
      recommended;

      - Listing of hazardous chemical relative to carcinogenicity;

      - Any generally applicable precautions for safe handling and use which are known to the
      chemical manufacturer, importer or employer preparing the materials safety data sheets,
      including appropriate hygienic practices, protective measures during repair and
      maintenance of contaminated equipment, and procedures for clean-up of spills and leaks;

      - Any generally applicable control measures which are known to the chemical
      manufacturer, importer or employer preparing the materials safety data sheets, such as
      appropriate engineering controls, work practices, or personal protective equipment;

      - Emergency and first aid procedures;

      - The date of preparation of the materials safety data sheets or last change to it;

      - The name, address and telephone number of the chemical manufacturer, importer,
      employer or other responsible party preparing or distributing the materials safety data
      sheets, who can provide additional information on the hazardous chemical and appropriate
      emergency procedures, if necessary.

    8.3. The materials safety data sheets are located: (Type all the places where materials
safety data sheets are located)

9. CONTROLS

    9.1. The most recent BEE IH survey will specify the required controls when performing
processes in the work center in the Process Summary Table. If process changes are made or new
chemicals are added, contact the BEE office prior to performing the process so BEE can reassess
the controls in place.

   9.2. Controlling hazards often requires a combination of protective measures. Protective
measures include the following:

      9.2.1. Administrative Controls.

        9.2.1.1. Substitution: Finding a less hazardous chemical used within a process, finding a
less hazardous process or finding a less hazardous piece of equipment. When feasible,
substitution is always the first choice for controlling a hazard.
AFI90-821_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                                           35


       9.2.1.2. Information and Training: In order to recognize the need for protection against a
hazard, you need to be aware that a hazard exists. This information is passed to you through
HAZCOM training, technical data and on-the-job training (OJT).

       9.2.1.3. Safe Work Practices: Through information and training, you can learn the safe
work practices for the chemicals you will be using. Remember, common sense goes a long way.

        9.2.1.4. Good Housekeeping and Personal Hygiene: The goal of good housekeeping is
to contain and remove hazards through proper storage, cleanup and the prompt removal and
correct disposal of chemical waste. The proper personal hygiene around hazardous chemicals
includes washing your hands before eating, drinking or smoking. It also includes prompt
removal of contaminated clothing and cleaning/laundering before wearing it again.

     9.2.2. Engineering Controls:

        9.2.1. Isolation: Using barriers or enclosures to separate the employee from the hazard.

         9.2.2. Ventilation: Providing a constant source of fresh air to the work area or removing
      airborne hazards at the source.

      9.2.3. PPE: Includes but is not limited to chemical resistant gloves, respiratory protection,
hearing protection, Tyvek coveralls, rubber aprons, face shields, and goggles.

      9.2.4. Our shop uses/does not use Filtering Face Piece Devises (FFPD). (The most
recent BEE IH survey will specify if FFPD’s are allowed. If FFPD are not on the IH
survey, then they are NOT allowed. Delete the rest if you do not use FFPD) Personnel who
wear voluntary use FFPD’s must receive initial and annual training from their supervisors on the
appropriate use of the device. They must read and heed all instructions provided by the
manufacturer on use, maintenance, cleaning and care, warnings regarding the respirator’s
limitations, and all other requirements in 29 CFR 1910.134 (c) (2), Appendix D. This training
must be documented on the individuals AF Form 55 or equivalent. Any questions can be
directed to BEF.

10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES: Brief specific of procedures. These procedures must
include, but are not limited to:

   10.1. Spill recognition or accidental chemical release (visual, odor, alarm)

   10.2. Escape procedures to include the locations of:

      10.2.1. Emergency eye wash stations are located at: (Write locations of all emergency eye
locations, if none, write none)

     10.2.2. Showers are located at: (Write locations of all showers, if none, write none)
 36                                         AFI90-821_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 11 JULY 2012


    10.2.3. Monitoring capabilities include: (Write any monitoring equipment used during
work, ie confined space meters, ect; if none, write none.)

   10.3. Emergency notification procedures; e.g. 9-1-1 and /or specific workplace procedures.

   10.4. Procedures for geographically separated facilities

11. NON-ROUTINE TASKS INVOLVING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS:

   11.1. A Non-Routine Task is:

      11.1.1. A task included within the activities of a workplace but performed infrequently.

      11.1.2. A detail or temporary duty performed outside of an employee’s normal workplace
or AFSC.

   11.2. Supervisors will ensure work area/shop operating instructions (OI), specific task lists,
and Job Safety Analyses (JSAs) thoroughly describe non-routine tasks, associated hazards, and
controls, for the non-routine task. OIs do not need to be prepared if technical orders (TO) or
other official documents adequately describe these tasks and associated hazards and controls.
Supervisors will ensure workers review these procedures before performing the non-routine
tasks. Refer to your shops Non-Routine Tasks Listing in your HAZCOM Binder and brief the
location of the corresponding OI or TO.

  11.3. The non-routine tasks for this shop are: (Type all non-routine tasks; if none, write
none.)

12. METHODS AND OBSERVATIONS TO DETECT PRESENCE OR RELEASE OF A
HAZARDOUS MATERIAL IN THE WORKPLACE:

  12.1. Monitoring Conducted by the Supervisor: Spot checks, observation of task,
monitoring equipment.

    12.2. Visual Appearance: Many chemicals have a distinct color and others, by their lack of
color, could be visually confused with water. Certain colors can be distorted depending upon the
lighting and the color of the material the chemical is in contact with. For these reasons, be
extremely careful when attempting to identify an unknown spill by color alone.

    12.3. Odor: Chemicals can also have a distinct smell, such as an oily or alcohol-like smell.
Unfortunately some chemicals are nearly odorless. In these cases, remain aware of you or a co-
worker’s physical reactions. Burning eyes, nose or throat, prickly skin, loss of coordination and
dizziness are a few signs of exposure to a hazardous chemical.

    12.4. If you suspect a release of hazardous materials visually or via odor, exercise
extreme caution and notify your supervisor immediately.

13. SUPPLEMENTAL TRAINING: Training for all potentially affected employees is required
when either a new hazard is brought into the work area/shop or a new chemical is introduced.
The training shall include all elements described in this training. When workers change work
area/shops either by assigned duties or location, work area/shop-specific training will be re-
accomplished.

                        MATERIALS SAFETY DATA SHEET TERMS

ACUTE EFFECT—Health effects that usually occur rapidly, as a result of short-term exposure.

ACUTE TOXICITY—Acute effects resulting from a single dose of, or exposure to, a substance.

ANSI—American National Standards Institute is a privately funded, voluntary membership
organization that identifies industrial and public needs for national consensus standards and
coordinates development of such standards.

APPEARANCE—A description of a substance (including color, size, and consistency) at normal
room temperature and normal atmospheric conditions.

ASPHYXIANT—A gas or vapor which can take up space in the air and reduce the concentration
of oxygen available for breathing. Examples include acetylene, methane, and carbon dioxide.

AUTO-IGNITION TEMPERATURE—The temperature at which a material will ignite
spontaneously or burn.

BOILING POINT—Temperature at which a liquid changes to a vapor state at a given pressure
(usually sea level pressure = 760 mmHg).

"C" OR CEILING—The maximum allowable human exposure limit for an airborne substance,
not to be exceeded even momentarily. Examples: hydrogen chloride, chlorine, nitrogen dioxide,
and some isocynates have ceiling standards.

CARCINOGEN—A material that causes cancer. A chemical is considered to be a carcinogen, by
OSHA regulation, if:

specific gravity of less than 1.0 will float in or on water. Insoluble materials with specific gravity
greater than 1.0 will sink in water. Most (but not all) flammable liquids have specific gravity less
than 1.0 and, if not soluble, will float on water an important consideration for fire suppression.

TERATOGEN—Any substance that causes growth abnormalities in embryos, genetic
modifications in cells, etc.

but not more than 1000 milligrams per kilogram of body weight when administered by
continuous contact for 24 hours (or less if death occurs within 24 hours) with the bare skin of
albino rabbits weighing between 2 and 3 kilograms each.

3. A chemical that has a median lethal concentration (LC50) in air of more than 200 parts per
million, but not more than 2000 parts per million by volume of gas or vapor, or more than two
milligrams per liter, but not more than 20 milligrams per liter of mist, fume or dust, when
administered by continuous inhalation for one hour (or less if death occurs within one hour) to
albino rats weighing between 200 and 300 grams each.

mouth, skin, or respiratory tract.

TWA (Time Weighted Average)—The airborne concentration of a material to which a person is
exposed, averaged over the total exposure time, generally the total workday (8 to 12 hours).

UEL or UFL—Upper explosive limit or upper flammable limit of a vapor or gas; the highest
concentration (highest percentage of the substance in air) that will produce a flash of fire when
an ignition source (heat, arc, or flame) is present. At higher concentrations, the mixture is too

will vigorously polymerize, decompose, condense, or become self-reactive under condition of
shocks, pressure, or temperature.

VAPOR DENSITY—The density of a material's vapor compared to the density of the air. If a
vapor density is greater than one, it is more dense than air and will drop to the floor or the lowest
point available. If the density is less than one, it is lighter than air and will float upwards like
helium.

VAPOR PRESSURE—The pressure exerted at a given temperature of a vapor in equilibrium
with its liquid or solid form. The higher the vapor pressure, the more easily a liquid will
evaporate. Liquid materials that evaporate easily are termed volatile, and this means that air
concentrations can build up quickly when working with the material in liquid form. Materials
with high vapor pressures may be particularly hazardous if you are working in enclosed or
AFI90-821_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                                            45

an inhalation hazard.

VOC—Volatile Organic Content.

  Water Reactive—A chemical that reacts with water to release a gas that is either
flammable or presents a health hazard.
