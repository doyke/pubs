SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include: the responsibilities of the 319th Communications Squadron (319 CS) and its customers,
the process of requesting support, events that receive full-service versus self-help support, PA
coordinators, and the mission of Transmission Systems.
1. General
   1.1. Government communications resources are for official use only.
 2                                             GRANDFORKSAFBI33-101 10 MARCH 2011


     1.2. The 319 CS/SCOT work center is the 319 ARW focal point for all Public Address (PA)
     Support. The work center is located in Building 314 and can be contacted during normal
     duty hours at Commercial: 701-747-3954 / DSN: 362-3954 or through e-mail at ‘GF Public
     Address Request’ on the global address list.
     1.3. There are two types of PA support.
        1.3.1. Full-service: 319 CS/SCOT will set up and run the PA equipment for the event.
        1.3.2. Self-help: 319 CS/SCOT will sign out and provide training on PA equipment to
        the user. The user operates the PA equipment for the event and assumes responsibility
        for the signed out equipment.
     1.4. The primary mission of 319 CS/SCOT is to provide communications-electronics
     maintenance to wing command and control communications systems. These systems carry a
     high priority and have a critical impact on flight safety. All outages affecting command and
     control missions have priority over PA Support. 319 CS/SCOT will work with the customers
     as much as possible, i.e., loan equipment out for an event, should support be unavailable.
2. Authorized/Unauthorized PA Events for Support and Usage.
     2.1. Authorized events include all military ceremonies, events, activities. Unauthorized PA
     events are those events that are purely social in nature or not directly related to military
     missions or activities. Unauthorized events will not receive PA support from 319 CS/SCOT.
NOTE: If the 319 ARW CC, 319 ARW CV, and/or 319 ARW Command Chief are scheduled
speakers the 319 CS will support the event.
     2.2. Examples of unauthorized events include but are not limited to:
        2.2.1. Private Organizations events, in accordance with AFI 34-223, Private
        Organization (PO) Program.
        2.2.2. Concerts by parties other than those officially sanctioned by the Air Force as being
        military in nature or serving a military need, such as recruitment.
        2.2.3. Fundraisers or other money-generating functions, such as car washes, dunk booths,
        etc.
        2.2.4. Social events such as squadron picnics, military spouses meetings, holiday parties,
        school graduations, going away parties, etc.
3. Responsibilities
     3.1. The 319 CS/CC will be the final approval authority in determining the level of support
     for all PA support requests.
     3.2. 319 CS/SCOT will:
        3.2.1. Approve PA support of authorized functions.
        3.2.2. Determine if the PA Support will be full service or self-help based on the current
        mission, manning requirements, and equipment availability, in accordance with
        paragraphs 4. and 5.
        3.2.3. Notify the requester as soon as possible if the event is scheduled for full-service
        support, self-help support, or if support is unauthorized. If it is a short-notice request,
GRANDFORKSAFBI33-101 10 MARCH 2011                                                          3


     319 CS/SCOT will notify the requestor whether or not the event is supportable due to
     workload, manning, or scheduling conflicts, etc.
     3.2.4. Set up and operate PA equipment for full-service support.
     3.2.5. Establish equipment checkout time with Point of Contact (POC) for self-help
     support.
     3.2.6. Provide military ceremonial music for official events.
     3.2.7. Schedule and conduct training for POCs. Training will include setting up
     equipment, adjusting sound levels, playing music, and requesting support.

     3.2.9. Maintain PA equipment.
  3.3. Organizations requiring PA support will:
     3.3.1. Submit PA requests at least 10 duty days prior to the event. PA requests
     submitted less than 10 duty days prior to event are considered short-notice and will be
     supported on a case-by-case basis. Blanket requests for recurring events will not be
     accepted.
         3.3.1.1. Submit requests by filling out the Public Address Form on the 319 ARW
