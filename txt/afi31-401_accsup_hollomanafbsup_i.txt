SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change reflects new requirements for management of the Information Security
Program at all echelons; transfers responsibility for Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information;
reflects the transfer of Information Security Program Manager (ISPM) duties and responsibilities
from the Chief, Security Forces or installation security official to the Chief of Information
Protection at MAJCOM and installation levels and codifies staff office changes from that action;
updates locations possible for overnight delivery of Secret information in urgent cases; updates
references and deletes terms not used in the text; updates glossary of references and supporting
information (Attachment 1); updates transmission procedures for unclassified controlled nuclear
information (Attachment 2); deletes use of United States Postal System registered mail or
Express Mail to transfer Secret or Confidential material (Attachment 4). An asterisk (*)
indicates newly revised material.

(ACC) This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision
updates office symbols and publication references; requires Information Security Program
Managers (ISPM) to prepare and distribute security manager meeting minutes to security
managers and other participants attending the security managers meeting; requires security
managers to maintain a Joint Clearance and Access Verification System (JCAVS) Eligibility and
Access Report in their security managers handbook; requires contractors located on ACC
installations be established as integrated visitor groups or intermittent visitors; delegates the
signing of Department of Energy (DOE) Form 5631.20, Request for Visit or Access Approval, to
security managers; establishes procedures for conducting systematic reviews for declassification;
requires supplemental controls for secure rooms storing Secret information, approved after 1
October 1995; requires courier authorization letters when hand carrying classified information
off of an installation; outlines requirements for documenting North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) training, Original Classification Authority (OCA) training and training for un-cleared
personnel.

(HOLLOMANAFB) This document is substantially revised to comply with AFI 31-401,
and AFI 31-401_ACCSUP1, and must be completely reviewed in its entirety. The revision
updates paragraph numbering, office symbols, and publication references. (paragraph 1.3.5.) For
the purpose of this supplement, staff agency chiefs are those individuals serving as Director of
Staff and Command Post Chief at Headquarters, 49th Wing (49 WG). Under no circumstances
will a Restricted/Controlled Area Badge (RAB) be solely use to verify an individual security
clearance. (paragraph 5.21.3.4.) Combinations to security containers, vaults, and secure rooms
shall be changed: (paragraph 5.21.3.4.1.) When placed in use; (paragraph 5.21.3.4.2.)
Whenever an individual knowing the combination no longer requires access due to reassignment
from duty section, permanent change of assignment (PCA), permanent change of station (PCS),
retirement, or separation; (paragraph 5.21.3.4.3.) When the combination has been subjected to
possible compromise; (5.21.3.4.4.) When taken out of service; and (paragraph 5.21.3.4.5.) On
an annual basis. (paragraph 8.5.2.) Unit Security Managers (USMs) shall document and
maintain initial training for all uncleared personnel in their unit. Security training shall be
current and a copy of the materials use for initial training shall be maintained in the USM

                                            Chapter 1

                         POLICY AND PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

1.1. Policy. It is Air Force policy to identify, classify, downgrade, declassify, mark, protect, and
destroy its classified and unclassified information and material consistent with national policy.
This general policy statement also applies to unclassified controlled information (Attachment 2)
under the purview of relevant statutes, regulations and directives [Reference DOD 5200.1-R,
C1.1.]
1.2. Philosophy. Protecting information is critical to mission accomplishment. The goal of the
Information Security Program is to efficiently and effectively protect Air Force information by
delegating authority to the lowest levels possible; encouraging and advocating use of risk
management principles; focusing on identifying and protecting only that information that
requires protection; integrating security procedures into our business processes so that they
become transparent; and, ensuring everyone understands their security roles and responsibilities.
1.3. Program Management. The strength of the Air Force Information Security Program is in
its infrastructure. The infrastructure is important because it facilitates effective communication of
our security policies and procedures to those performing the Air Force mission. With the support
of commanders at all levels, this is accomplished predominantly through our Information
Security Program Manager (ISPM) and security manager system. Both play an integral role in
ensuring unit personnel know and understand their role in protecting classified information
against unauthorized disclosure [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C1.2.]
   1.3.1. Senior Security Official. The Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Air
   Force (SAF/ AA) is designated the Air Force Senior Security Official responsible for
   ensuring implementation of the Information Security Program.
   1.3.2. Air Force Program Manager. The Director, Information Protection (SAF/AAP) is
   responsible for policy, resource advocacy, and oversight of this program.
   1.3.3. Commanders of Major Commands (MAJCOM), Field Operating Agencies (FOAs),
   Direct Reporting Units (DRUs), and Installations. These commanders are responsible for:
       1.3.3.1. Establishing information security programs.
       1.3.3.2. Identifying requirements.
       1.3.3.3. Executing their programs to comply with this policy.
   1.3.4. The installation Chief of the Information Protection (IP) Office (IPO) or MAJCOM
   Director, Information Protection is designated the ISPM at each Air Force installation or site.

        determined by the installation commander.
        1.3.4.2.3. (ACC) Contractors located on ACC installations will be designated as
        integrated visitor groups or intermittent visitors unless the Installation Commander
        deems circumstances exist to identify the contractor operation as a cleared facility.

     cycles, TDY, training requirements, and other assigned duties. Continuity should receive
     serious consideration in selection of security managers. Military security managers must
     have a favorable National Agency Check, local agency check, and credit check
     (NACLC); civilians a National Agency Check with written inquiries and credit check
     (ANACI), investigation or higher and eligibility for JPAS access before appointment.

         exercise care in appointing USM to ensure the most qualified and experienced
         personnel are selected. Frequent changes in the primary or alternate security manager
         position or overburdening them with other additional duties will degrade the
         effectiveness of the program and should be avoided. Personnel appointed as USM
         shall have as a minimum, 12 months retainability in the unit. 49 WG/IP staff
         members shall not be appointed as USM. Provide a copy of the memorandum within
         five (5) duty days of appointment to the Chief, 49 WG/IP. See an example of the

   Information Security Program to protect it. This decision may be made only by persons who
   have been specifically delegated the authority to do so, have received training in the exercise
   of this authority, and have program responsibility or cognizance over the information
   [Reference: DOD 5200.1-R, C2.1.]
        2.2.1.1. Before an original classification decision is made, it must be determined that
        classification guidance is not already available in the form of classification guides, plans
        or other memoranda.
        2.2.1.2. OCAs are accountable to the Secretary of Defense for their classification
        decisions.
        2.2.1.3. In those rare situations where the OCAs‟ decision must be rendered verbally due
        to the priorities of an on-going operation, written confirmation will be issued within
        seven days.
        2.2.1.4. OCAs must notify users when there are changes to an original decision.
        2.2.1.5. OCAs shall be prepared to present, as required, deposition and expert testimony
        in courts of law concerning classification of national security information and be
        prepared to defend and justify their original decisions.
   2.2.2. Classification may be applied only to information that is owned by, produced by or
   for, or is under the control of the United States Government. Information may be considered
   for classification only if it concerns one of the categories specified in Section 1.4 of EO
   12958, as amended.
2.3. Derivative Classification. The act of incorporating, paraphrasing, restating, or generating
in a new form information that is already classified, and marking the newly developed material
consistent with the markings of the source information. The source information ordinarily
consists of a classified document or a classification guide issued by an OCA. Within DOD, all
cleared personnel can perform derivative classification.
   2.3.1. Originating Agency‟s Determination Required (OADR). OADR is no longer an
   approved marking and should not be contained in any originally classified documents that
   have been created after October 14, 1995.
   2.3.2. X1 through X8 are no longer approved markings and should not be contained in any
   originally classified documents that have been created on or after September 22, 2003.
   2.3.3. When creating a derivatively classified document and using a source document that
   contains OADR or X1 through X8, the derivative classifier will place the following
   information in the Declassify On line:
      DECLASSIFY ON: Source marked OADR (or X1 thru X8, whatever is applicable)
          Date of source: 5 October 1993 (date of source document)
AFI31-401_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 JUNE 2011                                                   21


   2.3.4. These documents will be subject to review for declassification 25 years after the date
   of the source document.
   2.3.5. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Unit commanders/Staff Agency Chief shall appoint, in
   writing, cleared personnel (military, civilian, or contractor) as authorized derivative
   classifiers (i.e., ARTS, SORTS, UDM monitors). USM shall maintain a copy of this
   memorandum in their continuity binder and forward a copy to the 49 WG/IP.
2.4. Classification Prohibitions and Limitations.
   2.4.1. Under no circumstances shall information be classified in order to (1) conceal
   violation of law, inefficiency, or administrative error; (2) prevent embarrassment to a person,
   organization, or agency; (3) restrain competition; or (4) prevent or delay the release of
   information that does not require protection in the interest of the national security [Reference
   EO 12958, as amended, Section 1.7, DOD 5200.1-R, and Interim Information Security
   Guidance 16 April 2004].
   2.4.2. The OCA having jurisdiction over the subject matter determines if information
   requested under the FOIA or the mandatory declassification review (MDR) provisions of EO
   12958, as amended, should be declassified [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C2.4.3.5.]
2.5. Classification Challenges [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C4.9.]
   2.5.1. If holders of information have reason to believe that the information is improperly or
   unnecessarily classified, they shall communicate that belief to their commander or
   equivalent, staff agency chief, security manager, or supervisor.
   2.5.2. Send formal challenges to classification, in writing, to the OCA with jurisdiction over
   the information in question.
   2.5.3. Challenges to reclassification decisions are sent through command IP channels to
   SAF/AAP
   2.5.4. All classified information undergoing a challenge or a subsequent appeal will remain
   classified until a final resolution is reached.
2.6. Security Classification/Declassification Guides.
   2.6.1. Required Elements. A security classification/declassification guide (see Attachment 7
   for sample format) is the written record of an original classification decision and appropriate
   declassification instructions and should be issued as early as practical in the life cycle of the
   classified system, plan, program or project. It shall, at a minimum:
       2.6.1.1. Identify the subject matter of the classification guide.
       2.6.1.2. Identify the OCA by name or personal identifier, and position.
       2.6.1.3. Identify an agency Point of Contact (POC) (name, office symbol, mailing
       address, organizational e-mail address, DSN/commercial phone numbers) for questions
       regarding the classification guide.
       2.6.1.4. Provide the date of issuance or last review.
       2.6.1.5. State precisely the categories or elements of information to be declassified, to be
       downgraded, or not to be declassified.
22                          AFI31-401_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 JUNE 2011


     2.6.1.6. State which classification level applies to each element of information, and,
     when useful, specify the elements of information that are unclassified (NOTE: only one
     level of classification will be annotated for each element of information.)
     2.6.1.7. State a concise reason for classification which, at a minimum, cites the
     applicable classification category or categories in Section 1.4 of EO 12958, as amended.
     2.6.1.8. State, when applicable, special handling caveats.
     2.6.1.9. Prescribe declassification instructions for each element of classified information.
     2.6.1.10. Identify any related files series that have been exempted from automatic
     declassification pursuant to Section 3.3(c) of EO 12958, as amended.
     2.6.1.11. To the extent a guide is used in conjunction with the automatic declassification
     provisions in Section 3.3 of EO 12958, as amended, state precisely the elements of
     information to be exempted from declassification to include:
         2.6.1.11.1. The appropriate exemption category listed in section 3.3(b), and, when
         citing the exemption category listed in section 3.3(b)(9), specify the applicable
         statute, treaty or international agreement; and
         2.6.1.11.2. A date or event for declassification IAW section 1.5.
  2.6.2. OCA Responsibilities.
     2.6.2.1. It is the responsibility of the OCA to publish classification/declassification
     guides to facilitate the proper and uniform derivative classification and declassification of
     their information. NOTE: In some cases, OCAs may determine that publishing
     classification guidance in other forms is more effective, e.g., program protection plans,
     system protection guides, AFIs. In these cases, the applicable publication will be
     considered the guide and the publishing requirements in paragraph 3.3 still apply.
     2.6.2.2. Each OCA will revise (IAW paragraph 2.6.2.4 below) their security
     classification guides to include an advisory statement in the Release of Information
     section:
         2.6.2.2.1. Release of program data on the World Wide Web. Extreme care must be
         taken when considering information for release onto publicly accessible or
         unprotected World Wide Web sites. In addition to satisfying all of the aforementioned
         approval provisions, owners and/or releasers of information proposed for such release
         must ensure that it is not susceptible to compilation with other information to render
         sensitive or even classified data in the aggregate. The search and data mining
         capabilities of Web technology must be assessed from a risk management
         perspective. Information intended for publication on publicly accessible or
         unprotected web sites must be cleared for public release prior to publication
         according to AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policy and Procedures. If there are any
         doubts, do not release the information.
     2.6.2.3. All guides will be reviewed by the servicing Foreign Disclosure Office before
     final approval.
     2.6.2.4. Classification/declassification security guides shall be reviewed and updated, as
     circumstances require, but at least once every five years. NOTE: Due to the major
AFI31-401_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 JUNE 2011                                              23


     changes implemented by EO 12958, as amended, all current Air Force
     classification/declassification guides will be reviewed no later than 31 December 2005,
     and every five years thereafter.
  2.6.3. Publishing Requirements.
     2.6.3.1. All guides which extend classification beyond 25 years must be approved by the
     Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel (ISCAP). Once the OCA has signed
     the guide, the document will be sent to SAF/AAP who will forward it to the ISCAP for
     approval.
     2.6.3.2. The OCA will report publication of or changes to security classification/
     declassification guides to the Administrator, Defense Technical Information Center
     (DTIC) using DD Form 2024. DTIC will require an electronic copy of the guide.
     2.6.3.3. OCAs must also forward a hard copy of the applicable publication or change to:
         2.6.3.3.1. HQ AFHRA/RSA, 600 Chennault Circle, Maxwell AFB AL 36112-6424.
         2.6.3.3.2. SAF/PA, 1690 Air Force Pentagon, Washington, DC 20330-1690.
     2.6.3.4. All guides (to include any changes) will also be forwarded electronically to
     SAF/AAP        at     SAF.AAP.workflow@pentagon.af.mil         and     AFDO        at
     AFDO.Workflow@pentagon.af.mil in PDF and Microsoft Word format.
  2.6.4. Electronic Location of Guides. SAF/AAP will maintain the master list of all Air
  Force classification/declassification guides and will provide guides made available on the
  MOSIAC SIPRNET Community of Practice (CoP). Guides are also located on the DTIC
  web site. To access the DTIC web site you must have a DTIC account. The URL for this is
  http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/registration.
  2.6.5. Nuclear Weapons Classification Policy. The DOD and the Department of Energy
  (DoE) issue joint security classification guidance for information relating to nuclear
  weapons. The Air Force issues security classification policy for information relating to
  nuclear weapons. Most of these products are classified and users will require the appropriate
  security clearance before accessing them. Users may obtain copies of Joint DOD/DoE
  classification guides through DTIC at a cost. Users forward requests for copies of these
  guides to SAF/AAP (1720 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1340) through
  command IP channels. Requests must include the name, address, and phone number of the
  activity POC, and the POC‟s level of access. IPs will validate this information before
  submitting the requests to SAF/AAP. For all other Air Force or other agency guides, go
  direct to the originator. Users refer to DOD 5200.1-I, DOD Index of Security Classification
  Guides, to determine what other guides relating to nuclear weapons classification guidance
  are needed. DOD 5200.1-I can be obtained from DTIC.

                                            Chapter 3

               DECLASSIFYING AND DOWNGRADING INFORMATION

3.1. Declassification and Downgrading Officials. Within the Air Force, only OCAs have the
authority to declassify or downgrade classified information.
3.2. Declassification. Note: Exemptions identified in this chapter are found in ISSO Directive
Number 1, Section 2001.21(3)(i).
   3.2.1. Originally Classified Documents. The declassification decision determines the
   duration of protection [Reference EO 12958, as amended, Section 1.6.(a)(4) and ISOO
   Directive Number 1, Section2001.12.]. At the time an item of information is classified,
   original classifiers will determine which of the following four declassification instructions
   will be used, selecting whenever possible, the declassification instruction that will result in
   the shortest duration of classification.
       3.2.1.1. A date or event less than 10 years from the date of the document; or, if unable to
       identify such a date or event;
       3.2.1.2. A date 10 years from the date of the document; or
       3.2.1.3. A date greater than 10 and less than 25 years from the date of the document; or
       3.2.1.4. A date 25 years from the date of the document.
   3.2.2. Derivatively Classified Documents. The “Declassify on” line must include one of the
   following:
       3.2.2.1. The date or event up to 25 years, as noted on the source document; or
       3.2.2.2. Source marked OADR, date of source (cannot be a date after October 1995);
       3.2.2.3. Source marked X1-X8, date of source (cannot be a date after September 2003);
       3.2.2.4. 25X1 through 25X9, and a specific date or event for declassification; or
       3.2.2.5. 25X1-human (the only category that does not require a date or event follow it).
3.3. Exceptions. RD/FRD [Reference 10 CFR 1045.1 Subpart A]. Documents containing RD
or FRD are excluded from automatic declassification and do not require a declassification date.
RD must be reviewed by the DoE prior to release. DoE and DOD must jointly review documents
containing FRD prior to release.
3.4. Automatic Declassification. IAW EO 12958, as amended, Section 3.3, all Air Force
activities that possess classified information that is of permanent historical value and is 25 years
old or older should have completed a declassification review of these documents by 31 Dec
2006.
   3.4.1. The Air Force Declassification Office (AFDO) has published the Air Force
   Declassification Plan that provides the framework for Air Force compliance with Section 3.3
   of EO 12958, as amended. It pertains to all classified Air Force records that are 25 years old
   or older as of 31 December 2006, and have been determined under Federal law to have
   permanent historical value. The Air Force Declassification Plan is posted at the AFDO web
   site (http://www.afdo.hq.af.mil/Plan.htm). It is critical that records management and
AFI31-401_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 JUNE 2011                                                  25


   information security personnel work together to ensure that requirements of both are met on
   classified records that are going to be sent to the National Archives or Federal Records
   Center.
   3.4.2. All classified records shall be automatically declassified on 31 December of the year
   that is 25 years from the date of its original classification, unless it falls in one of the
   exemption categories (25X) listed in Section 3.3(b) of EO 12958, as amended.
   3.4.3. The 25X categories cannot be used unless the specific information has been approved
   through the ISCAP process. This is usually done in the form of a security
   classification/declassification guide. (See paragraph 2.6 and Attachment 7). The Air Force
   has an approved list of exemption categories (listed in the Air Force Declassification Plan);
   however, the specific item must still be annotated in the security classification/
   declassification guide before it is used on derivatively marked documents. For original
   classification decisions, no 25X marking, other than “25X1-human,” is permitted on the
   “declassify on” line. All originally classified documents will contain either a date or event
   less than 10 years or a date from 10 to 25 years. The only exception is the marking “25X1-
   human.” This marking may be used when the disclosure of the information could be expected
   to reveal the identity of a confidential human source or human intelligence source. This is the
   only 25X marking that does not require a date or event for declassification to be cited with
   the 25X marking.
3.5. Mandatory Review.
   3.5.1. Mandatory review requests must identify the information requested with enough
   specificity to allow for location of the records with a reasonable amount of effort.
   3.5.2. Send all requests for MDR to 11 CS/SCSL (MDR), 1000 Air Force Pentagon,
   Washington DC 20330-1000.
   3.5.3. Send appeals to MDR decisions through 11 CS/SCSL (MDR) to SAF/AA, the Air
   Force Appellate Authority for MDRs.
3.6. Systematic Review for Declassification. Activities will set up an annual schedule for
conducting systematic declassification reviews for the following records:
   3.6.1. Records of permanent historical value prior to their twenty-fifth birthday. These
   records will be reviewed and appropriate action taken by 31 Dec of the same year that is 25
   years from the date of its original classification.
   3.6.2. Other records. Activities will set up a reasonable schedule for conducting
   declassification reviews for all other classified records.
3.6. (ACC) Systematic Review for Declassification. ACC activities will review their
classified holdings with a view towards declassification during their annual clean out day(s).
This review pertains to classified holdings that were originally or derivatively classified by the
activity. Annual clean out days may coincide with required records conversion at minimum, on
or about December 31st or September 30th as applicable. Although they will not reveal classified
data, activities will ensure supporting records managers have approved classified records as
maintained and listed on the activity file plan. They will also ensure proper records retention and
disposition in accordance with the AF RDS.
 26                           AFI31-401_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 JUNE 2011


3.7. Referrals. A referral is information that is subject to the provisions of EO 12958, as
amended, Section 3.3, Automatic Declassification, and ISOO Directive No. 1, Section 2001.34,
and has been referred to, within, or outside the Air Force for review. AFDO is the focal point for
processing Air Force referrals. Detailed information regarding the referral process can be found
in the Air Force Declassification Plan.
3.8. Public Release. When information is declassified, it is not releasable to the public until it
has been approved for release through the security review process IAW AFI 35-101, Chapter 15.
The same holds true for declassified or unclassified information that will be placed on an Internet
site that can be accessed by the public.
3.9. Downgrading. Downgrading of information to a lower level of classification is appropriate
when the information no longer requires protection at the originally assigned level, and can be
properly protected at a lower level. Any official who is authorized to classify or declassify the
information and has authority over the information may downgrade information.
AFI31-401_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 JUNE 2011                                                 27

          ―This material contains Restricted Data as defined in the Atomic Energy Act of
          1954. Unauthorized disclosure subject to administrative and criminal
          sanctions.‖
       4.3.5.2. Documents containing FRD shall be marked:
                                FORMERLY RESTRICTED DATA

     ―Unauthorized disclosure subject to administrative and criminal sanctions. Handle as
     Restricted Data in foreign dissemination. Section 144.b, Atomic Energy Act, 1954
   4.3.6. For Official Use Only (FOUO). See chapter 4 of DOD 5400.7/AF Supplement.
4.4. NATO. NATO documents should be marked in compliance with AFI 31-406, Applying
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Protection Standards, USSAN Instruction 1-69,
United States Implementation of NATO Security Procedures, and C-M(2002)49, Security Within
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Any new policies, principles, standards, and
procedures contained in C-M(2002)49 and it‟s supporting directives take precedence, where they
conflict, over the guidelines expressed in USSAN 1-69, dated 21 April 1982.
4.5. Other Foreign Government Information (FGI).
   4.5.1. Classification designations for FGI often do not parallel U.S. classification
   designations. Moreover, many foreign governments and international organizations have a
   fourth level of classification that generally translates as "Restricted," and a category of
   unclassified information that is protected by law in the originating country and is provided on
   the condition that it will be treated "in confidence." A table of U.S. and foreign government
   classification markings can be found in DOD 5200.1-R, Appendix 6.
   4.5.2. Other foreign government classified documents shall be marked in English to identify
   the originating country and the applicable U.S. classification designation. If a classification
   designation has been applied to a foreign document by the originator, and it is the applicable
   U.S. English language designation, only the identity of the originating country need be
   applied to the document. Examples:
    A German document marked "Geheim" would be marked: DEU SECRET.
    A UK document marked "SECRET" would be marked: GBR SECRET.

   4.5.3. Foreign government documents that are marked with a classification designation that
   equates to Restricted, and unclassified foreign government documents that are provided to a
   DOD Component on the condition that they will be treated "in confidence," shall be marked
   to identify the originating government and whether they are Restricted or provided "in
   confidence." Additionally, they shall be marked "CONFIDENTIAL - Modified Handling".
   Example:
               A French document marked "Diffusion Restreinte” would be marked:

FRENCH                              RESTRICTED                                INFORMATION
Protect as:
 30                         AFI31-401_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 JUNE 2011


CONFIDENTIAL - Modified Handling
      4.5.3.1. (Ref: DOD 5200.1-R, para C6.6.3.) In order to ensure the protection of FGI
      provided in confidence (e.g., foreign government "Restricted," or foreign government
      unclassified information provided in confidence), such information must be classified
      under EO 12958, as amended. Provide a degree of protection to the FGI at least
      equivalent to that required by the foreign government or international organization that
      provided the information. If the foreign protection requirement is lower than the
      protection required for U.S. CONFIDENTIAL information, the following requirements
      shall be met:
          4.5.3.1.1. The information shall be provided only to those individuals who have a
          need-to-know and access is required by official duties.
          4.5.3.1.2. Individuals given access shall be notified of applicable handling
          instructions.
          4.5.3.1.3. Documents shall be stored so as to prevent unauthorized access.
4.6. Marking of Foreign Government and NATO Information In DOD Documents.
   4.6.1. When used in DOD documents, FGI must be marked to prevent premature
   declassification or unauthorized disclosure. To satisfy this requirement, U.S. documents that
   contain FGI shall be marked on the cover or first page, "THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS
   (indicate country of origin) INFORMATION." In addition, the portions shall be marked to
   identify the classification level and the country of origin, e.g., (GBR-C); (DEU-C). If the
   identity of the foreign government must be concealed, the cover or first page of the document
   shall be marked, "THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS FOREIGN GOVERNMENT
   INFORMATION," and applicable paragraphs shall be marked FGI together with the
   appropriate classification (FGI-S). The identity of the foreign government shall be
   maintained with the record copy, which must be appropriately protected.
   4.6.2. The "Derived From" line shall identify the U.S. as well as foreign classification
   sources. If the identity of the foreign government must be concealed, the "Derived From" line
   shall contain the marking "Foreign Government information." In that case, the identity of the
   foreign government will be maintained with the record copy and protected appropriately. A
   U.S. document shall not be downgraded below the highest level of FGI contained in the
   document or be declassified without the written approval of the foreign government that
   originated the information. Recommendations concerning downgrading or declassification
   shall be submitted through the DOD entity that created the document to the originating
   foreign government.
   4.6.3. DOD classified documents that contain extracts of NATO classified information shall
   be marked as follows on the cover or first page: "THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS NATO
   CLASSIFIED INFORMATION." Portions shall be marked to identify the NATO
   information (e.g., NS). When NATO or other foreign government RESTRICTED
   information is included in otherwise unclassified DOD documents, the following statement
   shall be affixed to the top and bottom of the page containing the information: ―This page
   contains (indicate NATO or country of origin) RESTRICTED information‖. The
   restricted portions shall be marked (e.g., (NR) (GBR-R). The cover, (or first page, if no
   cover) of the document shall contain the following statement: "This document contains
AFI31-401_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 JUNE 2011                                                 31


   NATO RESTRICTED information not marked for declassification (date of source) and
   shall be safeguarded in accordance with USSAN 1-69".
   4.6.4. Other foreign government classified documents should be marked in English to
   identify the originating country and the applicable U.S. classification designation.
   4.6.5. Foreign government documents that are marked with a classification designation that
   equates to RESTRICTED, and unclassified foreign government documents that are provided
   to a DOD component, should be marked to identify the originating government and whether
   they are restricted or provided in confidence.
4.7. Audio and Video Tapes. Personnel responsible for marking and maintaining original
classified audio and video tapes that document raw test data do not need to include
footers/headers showing the applicable classification markings. However, the required
classification markings must be placed on the outside of the container and reel. All copies made
from the original tapes must include headers/footers that show the applicable classification
markings. This will help ensure that valuable historical test data is not inadvertently erased
during the classification marking process. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C5.4.]
4.8. Removable Information Systems Storage Media. Use SF Form 706, Top Secret ADP
Media Classification Label; SF 707, Secret ADP Media Classification Label; SF Form 708,
Confidential ADP Media Classification Label; SF 710, Unclassified Label, SF Form 711, ADP
Data Descriptor Label, on removable information systems storage media. These are available
through the Air Force Publications Distribution System. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, Paragraphs
5-407 and 5-409a-b.]
   4.8.1. Many new removable information systems storage media are of size and shape that
   precludes application of the standard forms. Such media storing classified information must
   be permanently marked to display the highest classification of stored information.
   4.8.2. Designated Approving Authorities (DAA) have the authority to impose restrictions
   upon, and prohibit the use of, government owned removable information systems storage
   media for classified systems or networks. DAA approved restrictions will outline clearing, or
   destruction, procedures for unauthorized devices found in areas where classified processing
   takes place. Personally owned information systems storage media are prohibited in areas
   where classified is processed.
   4.8.3. The inherent risk of loss of small storage devices should be considered before using
   them for storing or transporting classified information. Procedures to reduce the potential for
   accidental loss must be included in local operating instructions. Include a review of these
   procedures in the semi-annual self-inspection and ISPRs.
4.9. Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C5.4.11.]
   4.9.1. See AFI 14-302, Control, Protection, and Dissemination of Sensitive Compartmented
   Information, for Air Force policy on intelligence information.
   4.9.2. The Special Security Office (SSO) is the focal point for release and dissemination of
   SCI. The Director of Central Intelligence Directive (DCID) 6/6, Security Controls on the
   Dissemination of Intelligence Information and DCID 6/7, Intelligence Disclosure Policy
   provide criteria for release of intelligence to foreign officials.

4.10. Authorized for Release To (REL TO) Markings. [Reference DUSD(/)I Memo 27 Sep
2004, subject: Security Classification Marking Instructions.]
   4.10.1. “REL TO” identifies classified information that an originator has predetermined to
   be releasable based on guidance provided by an Air Force specifically designated foreign
   disclosure official or has been released, through established foreign disclosure procedures
   and channels, to the foreign country(ies)/international organizations indicated.
   4.10.2. “REL TO” cannot be used with “Not Releasable to Foreign Nationals” (NOFORN)
   on page markings. When a document contains both NOFORN and REL TO portions,
   NOFORN takes precedence for the markings at the top and bottom of the page.
   4.10.3. The full marking “REL TO USA//applicable country trigraph(s), international
   organization or coalition force tetragraph” shall be used after the classification and will
   appear at the top and bottom of the front cover, if there is one, the title page, if there is one,
   the first page and the outside of the back cover, if there is one. “REL TO” must include
   country code “USA” as the first country code listed. After the USA, country trigraphic code
   shall be listed in alphabetical order followed by international organization/coalition
   tetragraphic codes listed in alphabetical order.
   4.10.4. Country codes shall be separated by a comma and a space with the last country code
   separated by a space, a lower case “and” and a space. EXAMPLE: TOP SECRET//REL TO
   USA, EGY and ISR.
   4.10.5. When portion marking, countries do not need to be listed unless they are different
   from the countries listed in the “REL TO” at the top and bottom of the page. Text that is
   releasable to all the countries listed at the top and bottom of the page shall be portion marked
   “REL”. EXAMPLE: (TS//REL).
   4.10.6. If the information is releasable to countries that are different than those listed in the
   overall “REL TO” marking, the portion marking has the same format, but with the specific
   countries/organizations listed alphabetically. EXAMPLE: The overall document marking is
   „SECRET//REL TO USA, NZL and NATO.” However, the portion marking may be:
   (S//REL TO USA, AUS, NZL and NATO) to indicate that information contained in this
   portion is also releasable to Australia.
   4.10.7. “NOFORN” is an authorized control marking for intelligence information IAW
   DCID 6/6, Security Controls on the Dissemination of Intelligence Information. Do not use
   the “NOFORN” dissemination control marking on any document, including derivatively
   classified documents, without first verifying that the requirements of DCID 6/6 are met and
   that the marking is actually warranted.
   4.10.8. Countries represented with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
   3166 trigraphic codes can be obtained from the ISPM or from INTELINK on the SIPRNET.
4.11. Classified Electronic Mail (E-Mail).
   4.11.1. All e-mails and documents accomplished on the SIPRNET, whether classified or
   unclassified, will contain the correct classification markings. Classified information may not
   be transmitted on the NIPRNET.
       4.11.1.1. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) All classified information and/or materials
       printed from the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) shall include the
AFI31-401_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 JUNE 2011                                                  33


     classification authority block which is located on the cover page of the classified
     document.
  4.11.2. The first marking in the Subject line of the e-mail will be the overall classification of
  the e-mail using these symbols: (S) for Secret, (C) for Confidential, and (U) for Unclassified.
  Following this will be the subject title, followed by the classification of the subject title.
  Example: Subject: (S) Unclassified E-Mail Sample (U)
  4.11.3. Do not send classified messages or mark messages as classified on an
  unclassified network.
  4.11.4. Place the appropriate classification of the e-mail in all uppercase letters as the first
  line of the e-mail message text.
  4.11.5. Begin the text of the message on the third line, leaving a blank line between the
  classification marking and the text.
  4.11.6. All paragraphs and subparagraphs will be marked with the appropriate portion
  marking. Use the abbreviated classification symbol at the beginning of all paragraphs and
  subparagraphs.
  4.11.7. Place the appropriate classification of the e-mail in all uppercase letters as the last
  line of the e-mail message text.
  4.11.8. All attachments (if any) will be marked appropriately with overall and portion
  markings. Indicate the classification of the attachment by placing the abbreviated
  classification symbol in parentheses before the attachment icon.
  4.11.9. Place classification, declassification, and downgrading instructions after the
  signature block on the left margin.

                                      SAFEGUARDING

Section 5A—Control Measures

5.1. General. Air Force personnel are responsible, both personally and officially, for
safeguarding classified information for which they have access. Collecting, obtaining, recording,
or removing, for any unauthorized use whatsoever, of any sensitive or classified information, is
prohibited.
   5.1.1. Everyone should be aware that advancing technology provides constantly changing
   means to quickly collect and transport information. The introduction of electronic storage or
   transmission devices into areas that store, process, and/or generate classified information
   increases the risk to that information.
   5.1.2. Consult the servicing DAA for specific guidance concerning introduction into areas
   containing Information Systems (IS). [Reference DODD 8100.2, Use of Commercial
   Wireless Devices, Services, and Technologies in the Department of Defense (DOD) Global
   Information Grid (GIG).]

Section 5B—Access

5.2. Granting Access to Classified Information. Personnel who have authorized possession,
knowledge, or control of classified information grant individuals access to classified information
when required for mission essential needs and when the individual has the appropriate clearance
eligibility according to AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management; has signed an SF
312, Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement (NdA), and has a need to know the
information. Those granting access to classified information must gain the originator‟s approval
before releasing the information outside the Executive Branch or as specified by the originator of
the material. Also see paragraph 5.4.1.1 of this AFI. [References DOD 5200.1-R, C6.2., and EO
12958, as amended, Section 4.1(c.)]
   5.2.1. The Secretary of Defense directed all military members and civilian employees with
   Top Secret eligibility or access to a specially controlled access category or compartmented
   information to make a one time verbal attestation to the first paragraph of the SF 312. The
   verbal attestation must be witnessed by at least one individual in addition to the official who
   presides over the attestation and manages the process [Reference DOD 5200.1-PH-1.] The
   procedures for personal attestation include:
       5.2.1.1. The statement, "Attestation completed on (date)," is placed in the bottom of the
       Organization block in Item 11 of the SF 312.
       5.2.1.2. The individual making the verbal attestation will complete Item 11 of the SF
       312. The witness will sign in the Witness block. The presiding official will sign in the
       Acceptance block.
       5.2.1.3. Record the date of attestation in JPAS.
       5.2.1.4. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) USM presides over the attestation and manages
       the process. USM shall record the date of attestation in JPAS. In addition, the USM
AFI31-401_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 JUNE 2011                                                  35


       shall mail Standard Form 312, Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement, to the
       respective organization listed in AFI 31-401, Chapter 5, paragraph 5.3
   5.2.2. Confirm an individual‟s access level. The holder of the information must confirm
   valid need-to-know and must verify the level of access authorization. Those granting access
   to classified information will confirm a person's access level by:
       5.2.2.1. Checking the person's access level, clearance eligibility, and date the person
       signed the SF 312 and completed Non-SCI Indoctrination, in JPAS; or
       5.2.2.2. Confirming it through the employee's security manager, supervisor, or
       commander or equivalent, or staff agency chief; or
       5.2.2.3. Receiving a visit request from a non-DOD visitor's security manager or
       supervisor. See paragraph 5.5 for further guidance.
       5.2.2.4. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Under no circumstances will a RAB be the sole
       basis for verifying an individual security clearance.
5.3. Nondisclosure Agreement (NdA). Signing the NdA is a prerequisite for obtaining access
(see paragraph 5.2). Unit commanders or equivalents and staff agency chiefs are responsible for
ensuring their employees have signed one by checking JPAS or the employee‟s personnel
records. If they have not signed one, those responsible use DOD 5200.1-PH-1, Classified
Information Nondisclosure Agreement (Standard Form 312) Briefing Pamphlet, to brief people
on the purpose. Record the NdA on-line through JPAS prior to sending the signed form for
retention. NOTE: When the employee‟s access level is passed to another office or activity, that
office or activity can assume the employee has signed one.
   5.3.1. Retention. Security managers mail the NdA to the following organizations who will
   retain the NdAs for 50 years.
       5.3.1.1. For active military members, to HQ AFPC/DPFFCMI, 550 C St., W, Suite 21,

      5.3.1.5. For persons outside the Executive Branch who receive access according to
      paragraph 5.4, the servicing ISPM to the activity granting access will file the NdA.
   5.3.2. Refusal To Sign. When a person refuses to sign an NdA, the commander or
   equivalent, or staff agency chief:
      5.3.2.1. Initiates security incident report, in JPAS, that the person refused to sign the
      NdA.
      5.3.2.2. Denies the individual access to classified information.
      5.3.2.3. Initiate actions to establish a Security Information File (SIF) according to AFI
      31-501.
5.4. Access by Persons Outside the Executive Branch.
   5.4.1. Policy. MAJCOM/FOA/DRU commanders and HAF 2-digits or their designees
   authorize individuals outside the executive branch to access Air Force classified material as
   follows unless otherwise provided in DOD 5200.1-R, paragraph C6.2.2.
      5.4.1.1. Authorizing Officials (those cited in paragraph 5.4.1 above) may grant access
      once they have:
          5.4.1.1.1. Gained release approval from the originator or owner of the information.
          Normally, this is the same official identified in paragraph 5.4.1.1.2.2 below.
          5.4.1.1.2. Determined the individual has a current favorable personnel security
          investigation as defined by AFI 31-501 and a check of JPAS and a local files check
          (LFC) shows there is no unfavorable information since the previous clearance. A LFC
          must be processed according to AFI 31-501. EXCEPTION: In cases where there is
          no current personnel security investigation as defined in AFI 31-501,
          MAJCOM/FOA/DRU commanders and HAF 2-digits may request a National Agency
          Check (NAC) and grant access up to the Secret level before the NAC is complete
          when there is a favorable LFC and the Air Force Central Adjudication Facility
          (AFCAF) confirms there is no unfavorable information on the individual in JPAS.
          When applying this exception, follow the procedures outlined in AFI 31-501,
          paragraph 3.11. for interim security clearance eligibility.
              5.4.1.1.2.1. Authority to grant access to persons outside the Executive Branch
              without a previous clearance may not be delegated below the listed positions in
              paragraph 5.4.1.1.2.
              5.4.1.1.2.2. Before material is released to persons outside the Executive Branch
              without a previous clearance, the OCA must be contacted and approve the access.
          5.4.1.1.3. Determined granting access will benefit the government.
      5.4.1.2. Requests for access must include:
AFI31-401_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 JUNE 2011                                                37


         5.4.1.2.1. The person‟s name, SSAN, date and place of birth, and citizenship.
         5.4.1.2.2. Place of employment.

     5.4.5.1. General. Requests for classified access by historical researchers will be
     processed only in exceptional cases wherein extraordinary justification exists. Access
     will be granted to the researcher only if the records cannot be obtained through available
     declassification processes (i.e., the FOIA and MDR processes) and when the access
     clearly supports the interests of national security.
     5.4.5.2. Providing Access.
         5.4.5.2.1. The researcher must apply to AFHRA OL-A/HOR in writing for the
         access. The application will fully describe the project including the sources of
         documentation that the researcher wants to access.
         5.4.5.2.2. If AFHRA OL-A/HOR accepts the request for access, they will provide the
         researcher with written authorization to go to the nearest Air Force installation
         security forces office to complete a personnel security questionnaire for a NAC
         according to AFI 31-501.
38                          AFI31-401_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 JUNE 2011


         5.4.5.2.3. If the results of the NAC are favorable and AFHRA OL-A/HOR approves
         access, the researcher must sign a SF 312 and an agreement to submit any notes and
         manuscript(s) for security and policy review(AFI 35-101). This process is to ensure
         the documents do not contain any classified information and, if so, determine if they
         can be declassified. Send the SF 312 to AFHRA OL-A/HOR for retention. Classified
         information will not be removed from government facilities.
         5.4.5.2.4. Other Terms.
             5.4.5.2.4.1. The access agreement is valid for two years. One two-year renewal is
             possible. A renewal will not be considered if the project appears to be inactive in
             the months before the end of the original agreement.
             5.4.5.2.4.2. Access will be limited to those records 25 or more years of age.
             5.4.5.2.4.3. Access based on a NAC is valid for Secret and Confidential
             information but does not meet the requirement for access to RD or SAP
             information. Access to Top Secret or SCI information is not authorized.
             5.4.5.2.4.4. Access will be allowed only to Air Force records at AFHSO,
             AFHRA, and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).
             5.4.5.2.4.5. Access to Air Force records still in the custody of the originating
             offices in the Washington National Capital Region must be approved in writing
             by the originating offices or their successors. It is the responsibility of the
             researcher to secure this approval.
  5.4.6. Former Presidential Appointees. Persons who previously occupied policy-making
  positions to which the President appointed them may not remove classified information upon
  departure from office. All such material must remain under the security control of the U.S.
  Government. Such persons may be authorized access to classified information they
  originated, received, reviewed, signed, or that was addressed to them while serving in their
  official capacity, provided the applicable Air Force OCA: [Reference DOD 5200.1-R,
  C6.2.2.5.]
     5.4.6.1. Makes a written determination that such access is clearly consistent with the
     interests of national security;
     5.4.6.2. Uses the same access determination procedures outlined in paragraph 5.4 of
     this AFI;
     5.4.6.3. Limits the access to specific categories of information over which the Air Force
     OCA has classification jurisdiction;
     5.4.6.4. Maintains custody of the information or authorizes access to documents in the
     custody of the NARA; and,
     5.4.6.5. Obtains the individual‟s agreement to safeguard the information and to submit
     any notes and manuscript for a security review (AFI 35-101, Chapter 15) to ensure that
     the documents do not contain classified information or to determine if any classified
     information should be declassified.
  5.4.7. Judicial Proceedings. See AFI 51-301, Civil Litigation, for more information
  regarding the release of classified information in litigation.
AFI31-401_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 JUNE 2011                                                  39


   5.4.8. Other Situations. Follow the guidance in paragraph 5.4.1.1 above. [Reference DOD
   5200.1-R, C6.2.2.7.]
   5.4.9. Foreign Nationals, Foreign Governments, and International Organizations. Owners of
   classified information disclose it to foreign nationals, foreign governments, and international
   organizations only when they receive authorization from SAF/IAPD, 1080 Air Force
   Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1080. (See AFI 16-201, Foreign Disclosure of Classified
   and Unclassified Military Information to Foreign Governments and International
   Organizations, for more specific guidance.) See Attachment 4 for guidance on transmitting
   classified information to foreign governments.
   5.4.10. Retired Flag or General Officers or Civilian Equivalent. See AFI 31-501. These
   individuals need not sign a NdA if the original one is already filed in their retired file or
   JPAS. (see paragraph 5.3.1.3).
5.5. Access by Visitors. JPAS is the primary source for confirming access eligibility for DOD
and DOD contractor personnel. Visit authorization letters will not be used to pass security
clearance information unless JPAS is not available. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.2.3.]
   5.5.1. Outgoing Visit Requests for Air Force Employees. When an Air Force employee
   requires access to classified information at:
       5.5.1.1. A non-DOD contractor activity, the supervisor or security manager contacts the
       office to be visited to determine the desired clearance verification.
       5.5.1.2. A DoE activity, the supervisor or security manager prepares and processes DoE
       Form 5631.20, according to DODD 5210.2, Access to and Dissemination of Restricted
       Data. Also see paragraph 1.5.1 of this AFI.
   5.5.2. Incoming Visit Requests. Air Force activity visit hosts serve as the approval authority
   for visits to their activities. Use JPAS to confirm security clearances of DOD personnel,
   including DOD contractors. Installation or activity commanders or equivalents, and staff
   agency chiefs receiving a visit request:
       5.5.2.1. From non-DOD contractors, see DOD 5220.22-M, Chapter 6.
       5.5.2.2. From foreign nationals or U.S. citizens representing a foreign government,
       process the visit request according to AFI 16-201.
5.6. Preventing Public Release of Classified Information. See AFI 35-101, Chapter 15, for
guidance on security reviews to prevent people from publishing classified information in
personal or commercial articles, presentations, theses, books or other products written for general
publication or distribution.
5.7. Access to Information Originating in a Non-DOD Department or Agency. Holders
allow access under the rules of the originating agency.
5.8. Administrative Controls.
   5.8.1. Top Secret. The security of Top Secret material is paramount. Strict compliance with
   Top Secret control procedures take precedence over administrative convenience. These
   procedures ensure stringent need to know rules and security safeguards are applied to our
   most critical and sensitive information. The Air Force accounts for Top Secret material and
   disposes of such administrative records according to WebRims Records Disposition Schedule.
40                         AFI31-401_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 JUNE 2011


     5.8.1.1. Establishing a Top Secret Control Account (TSCA). Unit commanders or
     equivalents, and staff agency chiefs who routinely originate, store, receive, or dispatch
     Top Secret material establish a Top Secret account and designate a Top Secret Control
     Officer (TSCO), with one or more alternates, to maintain it. The unit commander or staff
     agency chief will notify the installation ISPM of the establishment of TSCAs and the
     names of thE TSCO. The TSCO uses AF Form143, Top Secret Register Page, to
     account for each document (to include page changes and inserts that have not yet been
     incorporated into the basic document) and each piece of material or equipment to include
     IS media. NOTE: For IS information systems or microfiche media, TSCOs must either
     describe each Top Secret document stored on the media on the AF Form 143 or attach a
     list of the documents to it. This will facilitate a damage assessment if the media are lost
     or stolen. EXCEPTIONS:
     5.8.1.1. (ACC) Establishing a Top Secret Control Account (TSCA). Unit commanders
     and staff agency chiefs provide written notification to the servicing ISPM when
     establishing a TSCA and/or designating TSCOs. When requested, the ISPM provides
     training to these newly appointed officials.
     5.8.1.1. (HOLLOMANAFB) The Special Access Program (SAP) Program Security
     Officer and the installation Special Security Office (SSO) assume responsibility for
     supervision and oversight of Top Secret Control Accounts involving non-SAP/non-SCI
     classified information maintained in SAP and/or SCI facilities respectively.
        5.8.1.1.1. Top Secret Messages. TSCOs do not use AF Form 143 for Top Secret
        messages kept in telecommunications facilities on a transitory basis for less than 30
        days. Instead, use message delivery registers or other similar records of
        accountability.
            5.8.1.1.1.1. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) USM shall provide a copy of the Top
            Secret account establishment letter and appointment letter for a primary and
            alternate Top Secret Control Officer (TSCO) to the 49 WG/IP. Upon receipt of
            the appointment letter, 49 WG/IP will schedule training for newly appointed
            officials.
        5.8.1.1.2. Defense Courier Service (DCS) Receipts. TSCOs don‟t use AF Forms 143
        as a receipt for information received from or delivered to the DCS. DCS receipts
        suffice for accountability purposes in these cases. Retain as prescribed by WebRims
        Records Disposition Schedule. NOTE: TSCOs may automate their accounts as long
        as all of the required information is included in the information system.
     5.8.1.2. Top Secret Disclosure Records.
        5.8.1.2.1. The TSCO uses AF Form 144, Top Secret Access Record and Cover
        Sheet, as the disclosure record and keeps it attached to the applicable Top Secret
        material. Each person that accesses the attached Top Secret information signs the
        form prior to initial access.
        5.8.1.2.2. People assigned to an office that processes large volumes (i.e., several
        hundred documents) of Top Secret material need not record who accesses the
        material. NOTE: This applies only when these offices limit entry to assigned and
        appropriately cleared personnel identified on an access roster.
AFI31-401_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 JUNE 2011                                              41


     5.8.1.3. Top Secret Inventories. Unit commanders or equivalents, and staff agency
     chiefs:
        5.8.1.3.1. Designate officials to conduct annual inventories for all Top Secret
        material in the account and to conduct inventories whenever there is a change in
        TSCOs. These officials must be someone other than the TSCO or alternate TSCOs of
        the TSCA being inventoried. The purpose of the inventory is to ensure all of the Top
        Secret material is accounted for, discrepancies resolved, and its status is correctly
        reflected on the corresponding AF Form 143.
           5.8.1.3.1.1. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) USM and/or TSCO shall provide a
           copy of the Top Secret inventory report to ISPM annually or whenever there is a
           change of TSCO (primary or alternate).
        5.8.1.3.2. Ensure necessary actions are taken to correct deficiencies identified in the
        inventory report.
        5.8.1.3.3. Ensure the inventory report and a record of corrective actions taken are
        maintained with the account.
        5.8.1.3.4. May authorize the annual inventory of Top Secret documents and material
        in repositories, libraries, or activities storing large volumes of Top Secret documents
        and material be limited to a random sampling using the percentage scale indicated
        below. If account discrepancies are discovered the commander or equivalent, or staff
        agency chief must determine if the random sample percentage method will suffice or
        if a higher percentage inventory will be accomplished. If the higher percentage
        inventory is chosen, the inventory percentage will increase by no less than 20 percent.
           5.8.1.3.4.1. One hundred percent, if there are fewer than 300 Top Secret
           documents.
           5.8.1.3.4.2. No less than 90 percent if the holdings range from 301 to 400 Top
           Secret documents.
           5.8.1.3.4.3. No less than 80 percent if the holdings range from 401 to 500 Top
           Secret documents.
           5.8.1.3.4.4. No less than 70 percent if the holdings range from 501 to 600 Top
           Secret documents.
           5.8.1.3.4.5. No less than 60 percent if the holdings range from 601 to 800 Top
           Secret documents.
           5.8.1.3.4.6. No less than 50 percent if the holdings range from 801 to 1,000 Top
           Secret documents.
           5.8.1.3.4.7. No less than 40 percent if the holdings range from 1,001 to 1,300 Top
           Secret documents.
           5.8.1.3.4.8. No less than 30 percent if the holdings range from 1,301 to 1,800 Top
           Secret documents.
           5.8.1.3.4.9. No less than 20 percent if the holdings range from 1,801 to 2,800 Top
           Secret documents.
42                          AFI31-401_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 JUNE 2011


             5.8.1.3.4.10. No less than 10 percent if the holdings exceed 2,800 Top Secret
             documents.
     5.8.1.4. Special Access Programs will follow the inventory and accountability
     requirements prescribed by the AFSAPCO.
     5.8.1.5. Top Secret Receipts. TSCOs use AF Form 143 as a receipt when transferring
     Top Secret material from one TSCO to another on the same installation.
     5.8.1.6. Top Secret Facsimiles. Top Secret facsimiles will be processed as another copy
     of the main Top Secret document in the TSCA. All the same rules apply except the
     register page and disclosure record will be faxed along with the document to the
     addressee. The addressee will sign and return them immediately to the sender for
     inclusion in the TSCA.
  5.8.2. Secret. Unit commanders or equivalents, and staff agency chiefs set up procedures for
  internal control of Secret material. When entering Secret material into a mail distribution
  system, a receipt is required. Personnel may use AF Form 310, as a receipt.
  5.8.2. (ACC) Secret. Enclose the receipt in the inner envelope or container.
  5.8.3. Confidential. Individuals need not use a receipt for Confidential material unless asked
  to do so by the originating activity.
  5.8.4. Foreign Government and NATO Information. See DOD 5200.1-R, C6.6., for
  receipting requirements.
  5.8.5. Retention of Receipts. Retain receipt and other accountability records IAW WebRims
  Records Disposition Schedule.
  5.8.6. (Added-ACC) Commanders and staff agency chiefs ensure local security operating
  instructions address facsimile transmissions via secure circuits. Also, conspicuously post
  quick reference operating procedures at equipment authorized to transmit classified
  information. These procedures should outline how facsimile equipment is operated in a
  secure mode.
  5.8.7. (Added-ACC) Include procedures for handling registered, certified, first class, and
  express mail in agency local operating instructions.
     5.8.7.1. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) USM shall provide training to all personnel
     involved in receiving and/or dispatching registered, express, certified, and first class mail.
     Initial and annual training shall be current, properly documented, and maintained in the

     training was accomplished.
     5.8.7.2. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Unit commanders/Staff Agency Chief shall
     appoint, in writing, cleared personnel (military, civilian, or contractor) authorized to
     receive and/or dispatch registered, express, certified, and first class mail. USM shall
     maintain a copy of this memorandum in their continuity binder and forward a copy to the
     49 WG/IP.
AFI31-401_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 JUNE 2011                                                  43


Section 5C—Safeguarding

5.9. Care During Working Hours.
   5.9.1. Personnel removing classified material from storage must:
       5.9.1.1. For Top Secret material use AF Form 144, instead of SF Form 703, Top Secret
       Cover Sheet (see paragraph 5.8.1.2.1) except as specified in paragraph 5.8.1.2.2
       above. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.3.2.1.]
       5.9.1.2. For Secret or Confidential material use SF Form 704, Secret Cover Sheet, or SF
       Form 705, Confidential Cover Sheet, as appropriate. These forms are available through
       the Air Force Publications Distribution system.
       5.9.1.3. Use the SF Form 702, to record openings and closings for all General Services
       Administration (GSA)-approved security containers, vaults, and approved secure storage
       rooms.
       5.9.1.3. (HOLLOMANAFB) The Standard Form (SF) 702, Security Container Check
       Sheet, shall be properly filled out to record each time a GSA approved security container,
       vault, or accredited secure room is opened, closed, or checked (even if container was not
       opened) to ensure classified materials is secured. SF 702 shall be maintained for the
       current month.
   5.9.2. The nature of the classified material typically stored within a secure room or vault
   may preclude the use of cover sheets. Use cover sheets when feasible.
   5.9.3. (Added-ACC) Include procedures for the protection, removal, or destruction of
   classified material in case of fire, natural disaster, civil disturbance, terrorist activity, or
   enemy action, in agency local operating instructions or separate policy memorandum and in
   the Wing or equivalent records managers disaster preparedness plan and vital records
   program.
   5.9.4. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Unit personnel shall close/lock all doors and/or cover
   all windows prior to opening the classified security container and/or processing classified
   material on approved equipment. All electronic devices shall be stored outside the room.
   Localized visual aids shall be properly posted outside the door to prevent unauthorized
   personnel from entering the room/facility.
5.10. End-of-Day Security Checks. Each unit and staff agency that processes, stores, or
generates classified information will conduct an end-of-day security check to ensure classified
material is stored appropriately. Personnel conducting these checks will do so at the close of each
working day and record them on the SF Form 701, when security containers are present, even if
the container was not opened that day. The “Checked By” column of the SF 702 does not require
end-of-day documentation. Activities that are continuously staffed will establish local procedures
to provide for daily security checks. Document those daily security checks on the SF 701. Note:
Additional security and safety checks may be added in the blanks on the SF 701. All security
containers will be listed on the SF 701 for end-of-day checks.
5.10. (HOLLOMANAFB)The SF 701, Activity Security Checklist, shall be completed using a
black or blue ink pen annotating the times and initials of the person conducting the end of day
checks. SF 701 shall be posted in the same room where the security container is located and/or
 44                          AFI31-401_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 JUNE 2011


where classified processing is conducted. All security containers, vaults, and accredited secure
rooms (open storage) shall be listed on the SF 701 for end-of-day checks. The SF 701 shall be
maintained for the current month. The checked by column of SF 702 shall be annotated each
duty day to record end of checks.
5.11. Residential Storage Arrangements.
   5.11.1. SECAF and SAF/AA authorize the removal of Top Secret information from
   designated working areas. Requesters send requests through command IP channels to
   SAF/AAP [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.3.7.1.]
   5.11.2. MAJCOM/FOA/DRU commanders, or their ISPMs approve requests for removing
   Secret and Confidential material from designated work areas during non-duty hours
   [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C63.7.2.]
   5.11.2. (ACC) Submit residential storage requests to the Deputy Director of Installations for
   Security Forces (HQ ACC/A7-2 (SF)) for approval. Requests will contain full justification
   for residential storage and operating instructions/contingency plans for the protection of
   classified information at the residence.
   5.11.3. Contingency Plans. The written procedures will be developed as required by DOD
   5200.1-R, C6.3.7.3. to include arrangements for notifying the responsible activity to pick up
   the classified container and material in the event something happens to the user [Reference
   DOD 5200.1-R, C6.3.4.]
5.12. In-Transit Storage. Installation commanders:
   5.12.1. Provide an overnight repository for classified material. A locally developed
   awareness program ensures operations dispatch, passenger services, base entry controllers,
   and billeting staff are aware of the availability.
   5.12.1. (HOLLOMANAFB) The 49th Wing Commander (49 WG/CC) has designated the
   49 WG Command Post (49 WG/CP) in Building 29, as the repository for overnight storage of
   classified materials up to Top Secret (collateral level). USM shall, in advance, notify Chief,
   49 WG/IP and coordinate with the 49 WG/CP Controller (572-7575), prior to storing any
   classified material in the Command Post. USM shall be responsible for disseminating this
   information to all personnel during initial and/or annual unit security education training.
   5.12.2. Authorize the storage of Secret and Confidential material on the flightline during in-
   processing for deployment when the material is stored in a standard GSA-approved security
   container and the in-transit area is controlled and located on an Air Force installation.
5.13. Classified Meetings and Conferences [Reference DOD 5200. 1-R, C6.3.8.]
   5.13.1. Classified information at meetings, conferences, symposia, portions or sessions of
   meetings, conferences, etc., during which classified information is to be disseminated shall
   be limited to appropriately cleared U.S. Government or U.S. Government contractor
   locations. Auditoriums, assembly halls, or gymnasiums that are primarily for public
   gatherings at cleared contractor facilities will not be used for a classified meeting at which
   Top Secret or Secret information would be disclosed, even though it is located on a portion
   of the contractor‟s cleared facility [DOD 5220.22-R, Para C1.4.5.1].
AFI31-401_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 JUNE 2011                                                  45


   5.13.2. Facility Approval Authority. Installation commanders or their designees assess the
   need to establish and approve secure conference and classified training facilities. Normally,
   secure conference or classified training facilities are only established at locations where
   frequent classified meetings or forums occur. If such a facility does not openly store
   classified information, secure construction requirements are not mandated. However, if
   installation commanders or their designees determine the local threat and security
   environment dictates more stringent construction requirements, they can use DOD 5200.1-R,
   Appendix 7 as a guide for constructing the facility.
   5.13.2. (ACC) Facility Approval Authority. Secure conference facilities are not required
   when conducting classified meetings or conferences on government installations.
   Organizations are highly encouraged to use the checklist in Attachment 9 (Added) before
   conducting conferences, seminars, exhibits, symposia, conventions, training courses, or other
   such gatherings during which classified information is disseminated to ensure proper
   safeguarding and access requirements are met.
      5.13.2.1. (Added-ACC) Organizations will notify the ISPM, in writing, of all secure
      conference facility requirements. Security forces and civil engineering personnel will
      inspect all new and modified secure conference facilities to ensure security requirements
      and construction standards are met IAW Attachment 10 (Added). Results of the
      inspection will be documented in writing and maintained in the official records
      repository. The servicing ISPM certifies secure conference facilities in writing. The
      requesting organization maintains the original certification package and the security
      forces maintain a copy IAW the RDS.
      5.13.2.2. (Added-ACC) Proposed structural modifications to secure conference
      facilities must be coordinated with the ISPM and civil engineer. The ISPM and civil
      engineer must recertify, in writing, the structural integrity of secure conference facilities
      that have been modified.
      5.13.2.3. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Sponsoring/hosting official who arranges and/or
      convenes a classified meeting or conference (up to collateral SECRET) shall comply with
      ACC Supplement 1, Attachment 9. Sponsoring/hosting official will select facilities that

      perimeter area surveillance by posting cleared personnel from the sponsoring agency.
      The sponsoring/hosting official explains to each person presenting classified information
      about the imposed security limitations, level of classified authorized for presentation, the
      clearance, and need-to-know requirements for those personnel attending.
   5.13.3. Foreign Participation. Hosting officials refer to AFI 16-201, Foreign Disclosure of
   Classified and Unclassified Military Information to Foreign Governments and International
   Organizations, for specific guidance.
   5.13.4. Technical Surveillance Countermeasures (TSCM) Surveys. Commanders or
   equivalents, and staff agency chiefs or their designees determine to do TSCM surveys based
   on mission sensitivity and threat. See AFI 71-101, Volume 3, The Air Force Technical
   Surveillance Countermeasures Program for additional guidance.
5.14. Protecting Classified Material on Aircraft. Classified material and components are
routinely carried on USAF aircraft. The purpose of this paragraph is to provide minimum
 46                          AFI31-401_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 JUNE 2011


standards for the protection of classified material and components while minimizing the impact
on aircrew operations. The following minimum standards are established to provide cost
effective security of classified material and components and to ensure detection of unauthorized
access.
   5.14.1. Aircraft commanders (owners/users) are responsible for the protection of classified
   material and components aboard their aircraft whether on a DOD facility, at a civilian
   airfield, or when stopping in foreign countries IAW DOD 5200.1-R, paragraph C6.3.9.
   Aircraft commanders should consult with the local ISPM or senior security forces
   representative for assistance in complying with these requirements.
   5.14.2. To provide security-in-depth for classified components and material on aircraft, park
   the aircraft in an established restricted area or equivalent if the aircraft is designated
   Protection Level (PL) 1, 2, or 3. Refer to AFI 31-101, Air Force Installation Security
   Program, for details about protection levels.
       5.14.2.1. Lock the aircraft, when possible, using a GSA-approved changeable
       combination padlock (Federal Specification FF-P-110) series available from GSA at 800-
       525-8027, under NSN 5340-00-285-6523 to secure the crew entry door, and/or
       5.14.2.2. Place all removable classified material (e.g., paper documents, floppy disks,
       videotapes) in a storage container secured with a GSA-approved lock. The storage
       container must be a seamless metal (or similar construction) box or one with welded
       seams and a lockable hinged top secured to the aircraft. Hinges must be either internally
       mounted or welded. Containers installed for storage of weapons may also be used to store
       classified material even if weapons/ammunition are present, provided the criteria listed
       above have been met.
           5.14.2.2.1. Have the aircraft and container checked for tampering every 12 hours. If
           unable to comply with the 12 hours due to crew rest, perform these checks no later
           than 1 hour after official end of crew rest.
           5.14.2.2.2. Zeroize keyed COMSEC equipment as required by AFKAG-1N, Air
           Force Communications Security (COMSEC) Operations.
       5.14.2.3. If the aircraft cannot be locked and is not equipped with a storage container,
       place the removable classified in an approved security container in an authorized U.S.
       facility. Classified components, attached to the aircraft, do not have to be removed.
       5.14.2.4. (Added-ACC) If none of the criteria in paragraphs 5.14.2.1 through 5.14.2.3
       can be met, U.S. cleared personnel must provide continuous surveillance.
   5.14.3. To provide security-in-depth for classified components and material on PL 4 or non-
   PL aircraft, park the aircraft in a controlled area. PL 4 and non-PL aircraft should not be
   parked in a restricted area due to use of force limitations.
       5.14.3.1. Lock the aircraft using a GSA-approved changeable combination padlock
       (Federal Specification FF-P-110) series available from GSA under NSN 5340-00-285-
       6523 to secure the crew entry door, and
       5.14.3.2. Secure removable classified material IAW paragraph 5.14.2.2 or 5.14.2.3.
AFI31-401_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 JUNE 2011                                                 47


   5.14.4. At non-U.S. controlled locations, host nation restricted/controlled areas may be used
   only if all material and components aboard the aircraft have been approved for release to the
   host nation by a cognizant foreign disclosure authority. Material should be secured IAW
   paragraph 5.14.2 for restricted areas and paragraph 5.14.3 for controlled areas.
   5.14.5. If the aircraft cannot be parked in a restricted/controlled area:
      5.14.5.1. Place removable classified material in a storage container and secure the
      container as described in paragraph 5.14.2.2. Lock all aircraft egress points or secure
      them from the inside. Seal the aircraft with tamper proof seals such as evidence tape,
      numerically accountable metal, or plastic seals.
      5.14.5.2. If the aircraft can be locked and sealed but there is no storage container,
      remove all removable classified material and store it in an approved security container in
      an authorized U.S. facility. Classified components (e.g., AAR 47, ALE 47, etc.) may be
      stored in a locked and sealed aircraft.
      5.14.5.3. If the aircraft cannot be locked and sealed and no storage container is available,
      off-load all classified material and components to an approved security container in an
      authorized U.S. facility.
      5.14.5.4. If none of the above criteria can be met, U.S. cleared personnel must provide
      continuous surveillance. Foreign national personnel cleared by their government may be
      used if all material and components aboard the aircraft have been approved for release to
      the host nation by a cognizant foreign disclosure authority.
   5.14.6. MAJCOM/FOA/DRUs determine specific risk management security standards for
   weather diverts and in-flight emergencies. Review AFKAG-1N if the classified information
   is COMSEC material.
   5.14.6. (ACC) During weather diverts and in-flight emergencies, aircraft commanders will
   determine how classified information will be secured using the procedures in AFI 31-401,
   paragraph 5.14, as applicable. When those procedures cannot be met, and U.S. cleared
   personnel are not available, using local guards for area control is an acceptable risk when
   combined with the use of tamper evident seals on aircraft openings. When local guards are
   not available, the use of tamper evident seals on aircraft openings will be the minimum-
   security requirement. If the seal is subsequently determined to have been broken, the aircraft
   commander inspects the aircraft for damage, theft of equipment, sabotage, etc. The aircraft
   commander will report the incident to their home base servicing security office.
   5.14.7. If evidence exists of unauthorized entry, initiate a security investigation IAW
   Chapter 9 of this AFI.
5.15. Information Processing Equipment.
   5.15.1. Machines with Copying Capability. For copiers and facsimile machines or any
   machines with copying capability (e.g., microfiche machines), personnel consult their unit
   information manager (3A0X1) to determine if the machines are authorized for copying
   classified, and if so, determine if they retain any latent images when copying classified, and
   how to clear them when they do. Networked copiers present unique security hazards that
   require DAA approval. Also see paragraph 5.24 for reproduction authority [Reference DOD
   5200.1-R, C6.3.10.]
 48                           AFI31-401_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 JUNE 2011


   5.15.1. (ACC) Machines with Copying Capability. Copiers with volatile memory, no
   permanent memory, can be approved for classified reproduction. Copiers with permanent
   memory are not authorized for classified reproduction. Procedures must be developed to
   ensure volatile memory is erased after each classified reproduction. Depending on the model,
   memory can be erased by turning off the copier and/or unplugging the copier.
   5.15.2. Protect information system equipment or removable hard disk drive and the
   information system media at the highest security classification processed by the system
   [Reference Air Force Special Security Instruction (AFSSI) 5020, paragraph 2.2.2.]
   5.15.2. (HOLLOMANAFB) All active (operational) SIPRNet systems shall be manned by
   a cleared person at all time unless located in an accredited secure room (open storage).
   5.15.3. For any type of printer with a ribbon that has been used to print classified
   information, personnel remove the ribbon and store it as classified. See DOD 5200.1-R,
   Chapter 6 for storage requirements.
   5.15.4. Used toner cartridges may be treated, handled, stored, and disposed of as
   unclassified, when removed from equipment that has successfully completed its last print
   cycle.
5.16. General Safeguarding Policy. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C6.4.]

   WebRims Records Disposition Schedule.
   5.16.6. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Portable/Personal Electronic Devices (PED). The use
   or possession of all PEDs used for storing, processing, and/or transmitting information is
   strictly prohibited within all areas where classified material is discussed, briefed, stored, or
   processed without written authorization from the Designated Approval Authority.
5.17. Standards for Storage Equipment. GSA-approved security containers must have a label
stating “General Services Administration Approved Security Container” affixed to the front of
the container usually on the control or top drawer.
   5.17.1. If the label is missing or if the container‟s integrity is in question, the container shall
   be inspected by a GSA certified inspector.
   5.17.2. Organizations without GSA certified inspectors must confirm that contractor
   inspectors have current GSA inspector training certificates prior to allowing them to
   determine the security integrity of GSA-approved containers.

   replaced with those meeting Federal Specification FF-L-2740 starting with those storing the
   most sensitive information according to the priority matrix in DOD 5200.1-R, Appendix 7.
   5.18.2. Due to operational necessity or the size and nature of some classified materials, it
   may be necessary to construct secure rooms for storage because GSA-approved containers or
   vaults are unsuitable or impractical. Secure rooms must be approved by the ISPM and be
   constructed IAW DOD 5200.1-R Appendix 7. Access to secure rooms must be controlled to
   preclude unauthorized access. Access shall be limited to authorized persons who have an
   appropriate security clearance and a need-to-know for the classified material/information
   within the area. Persons without the appropriate level of clearance and/or need to know shall
   be escorted at all times by an authorized person where inadvertent or unauthorized exposure
   to classified information cannot otherwise be effectively prevented. The nature of the
   classified material typically stored within a secure room or vault may preclude the use of
   cover sheets.
   5.18.2. (ACC) Organizations will notify the ISPM, in writing, of all vault or secure room
   requirements. Vaults and secure rooms will not be certified for convenience. Security forces
   and civil engineering personnel will inspect all new and modified vaults and secure rooms to
   ensure security requirements and construction standards are met IAW DoD 5200.1-R,
   Appendix 7. Results of the inspection will be documented in writing and maintained in the
   official records repository. The ISPM certifies secure rooms and vaults in writing. The
   requesting organization maintains the original certification package in the vault or certified
   room, and the security forces maintain a copy; copies must be maintained IAW the RDS.
      5.18.2.1. (Added-ACC) Supplemental controls, such as intrusion detection systems
      (IDS), continuous personal surveillance, or 4-hour checks, are required for secure rooms
      approved/certified after 1 Oct 95 storing Secret information.
          5.18.2.1.1. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Excess unclassified material (i.e. chairs,
          tables, computer equipment, boxes of paper, supplies, etc.) shall not be stored in an
          accredited secure room.
      5.18.2.2. (Added-ACC) Proposed structural modifications made to vaults and secure
      rooms must be coordinated with the ISPM and civil engineer. The ISPM and civil
      engineer must recertify, in writing, the structural integrity of vaults and secure rooms that
      have been modified.

                        TRANSMISSION AND TRANSPORTATION

Section 6A—Methods of Transmission or Transportation

6.1. General Policy.
   6.1.1. Hand carrying Classified Material During Temporary Duty (TDY) Travel. Hand
   carrying classified material during TDY poses a risk and should be done as a last resort in
   critical situations. Whenever possible, personnel will use standard secure methods for
   relaying the data, e.g., mail through secure channels or through approved secure electronic
   means. Authorizing officials must assess the risk before authorizing the hand carrying of
   classified material. Some factors to consider during the risk assessment process are:
       6.1.1.1. The environment in which the material will be handcarried. Consider the
       chances of the material being confiscated by unauthorized personnel. The servicing
       AFOSI office should be able to assist in determining the risks associated with the
       environment.
       6.1.1.2. The sensitivity of the information. Consider the damage it could cause the
       United States if the information was compromised.
       6.1.1.3. The availability of authorized facilities for storing the classified during overnight
       layovers, at the TDY location, etc. Consider storing the material at a U.S. military
       installation or other government facility.
   6.1.2. Laptop Computers are High Risk. Because of their commercial value, laptop
   computers are an especially high risk when used to transport classified information. When
   using laptops to handcarry classified information, couriers must ensure both laptop and disks
   are prepared according to paragraph 6.6.3 In addition, as required for all classified material,
   couriers must take special care to ensure laptops and disks are kept under constant
   surveillance or in secure facilities/containers at all times.
   6.1.3. Air Force Office of Primary Responsibility for Transmission and Transportation
   Policy. SAF/AAP establishes Air Force policy and procedures for transmission and
   transportation of classified information and material [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.1.1.]
   6.1.4. Transmitting Classified Material by Pneumatic Tube Systems. Installation
   commanders approve the use of pneumatic tube systems and ensure that the equipment and
   procedures provide adequate security [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.1.1.]
   6.1.5. Electronic Transmission and Physical Transportation of COMSEC Material. Personnel
   may acquire information on electronic transmission and physical transportation of COMSEC
   information and material from their supporting COMSEC manager. (Reference AFI 33-201,
   AFI 33-211, AFI33-275, and DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.1.2.]
   6.1.6. Releasing Other Agency Information Outside of the DoD. Personnel go direct to
   owners of other agency information to request permission to release the information outside
   the DoD [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.1.4.]

C7.1.2.]
   6.2.1. Electronic Means. Obtain information about transmitting Top Secret information via
   electronic means from their Information Assurance office. See paragraph 5.8 [Reference
   DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.2.2.]
   6.2.2. DOD Component Courier Service. The Air Force does not have its own courier
   service [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.2.4.]
   6.2.3. Department of State Diplomatic Courier Service. Personnel who need to transport
   classified material use the Department of State courier system when: [Reference DOD
   5200.1-R C7.1.2.5.]
      6.2.3.1. Transporting classified material through or within countries hostile to the United
      States or any foreign country that may inspect it.
      6.2.3.2. Transporting Top Secret material to an installation serviced by diplomatic
      pouch. Personnel can find out if they are serviced by diplomatic pouch through their local
      military postal office.
6.3. Transmitting and Transporting Secret Information. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R,
C7.1.3.]
   6.3.1. Also see AFI 31-601 [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.3.2.]
   6.3.2. The Air Force authorizes the use of the current holder of the GSA contract for
   overnight delivery of Secret information in urgent cases and when the delivery is between
   DOD Components and their cleared contractor facilities within the United States and its
   Territories. This applies to locations in Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico when overnight
   delivery is possible. USD/I has already ensured the conditions cited in DOD 5200.1-R,
   paragraph C7.1.3.3, have been met [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C7.1.3.3.]
      6.3.2.1. The Defense Security Service maintains a list of authorized GSA contract
      overnight delivery services at http://www.dss.mil/isec/approved_overnight.htm.
      6.3.2.2. The carriers identified on the DSS list may be used for urgent overnight delivery
      of Secret and Confidential material within the continental United States (CONUS) when
      overnight delivery cannot reasonably be accomplished by the U.S. Postal Service.
      However, classified COMSEC information may not be transmitted overnight. Controlled
      Cryptographic Information (CCI) that is unclassified may be shipped overnight.
      6.3.2.3. Carrier personnel should not be notified that the package contains classified
      material.
      6.3.2.4. Packages are typically shipped on Monday through Thursday only. This ensures
      that the package does not remain in the possession of the carrier service over a weekend.
      However, the security manager may approve shipment on other days providing the
      receiver has appropriate procedures in place. These procedures must ensure that a cleared
      person will receive and sign for the package on Saturday, Sunday, or holidays, and that
      he or she is able to secure the package in approved storage. [DOD 4525.8-M.]
      6.3.2.5. The sender is responsible for ensuring that an authorized person will be available
      to receive the delivery and for verification of the correct mailing address.
AFI31-401_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 JUNE 2011                                                59

   6.4.1. Since first class mail bearing the “Return Service Requested” notice is an option for
   transmitting Confidential material, recipients must protect it as Confidential material unless
   they determine the contents are unclassified. EXCEPTION: Official Mail Center (OMC) and
   Activity Distribution Offices (ADO) will comply with the provisions of DOD 4525.8-M/AF
   Sup.
      6.4.1.1. The outer envelope or wrapper shall be endorsed with “Return Service
      Requested” instead of “POSTMASTER: Do Not Forward”.

                        SECURITY EDUCATION AND TRAINING

Section 8A—Policy

8.1. General Policy. Effective information security training is a cornerstone of the Air Force
Information Security Program. All Air Force personnel need information security training
whether they have access to classified information or not. All Air Force personnel are
individually responsible for protecting the national interests of the United States. All security
infractions and/or violations must be immediately reported, circumstances examined and those
responsible held accountable and appropriate corrective action taken. Commanders or
equivalents, and staff agency chiefs are responsible for ensuring that personnel are
knowledgeable and understand their responsibility to protect information and resources deemed
vital to national security.
8.2. Methodology. The Air Force will provide information security training to its personnel and
contractors, as appropriate, on a continuous basis using government and commercial training
sources. Various training methods will be used to administer training, such as classroom
instruction, one-on-one, computer-based, and other distant learning training media. The Air
Force will maintain a cadre of trained professional career security personnel and security
managers to administer, implement, and measure the program‟s effectiveness. When funds and
resources permit, professional security personnel and security managers should attend in-
residence type training courses.
8.3. Roles and Responsibilities.
   8.3.1. These roles and responsibilities are in addition to those listed in paragraph 1.3.
   8.3.2. SAF/AAP is responsible for coordinating development of Air Force specific
   information security training course materials and curriculums.

                                           Chapter 9

    ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL COMPROMISE OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION

9.1. Policy. [Reference DOD 5200.1-R, C10.]
   9.1.1. It is Air Force policy that security incidents will be thoroughly investigated to
   minimize any possible damage to national security. The investigation will identify
   appropriate corrective actions that will be immediately implemented to prevent future
   security incidents. Further, if the security incident leads to the actual or potential compromise
   of classified information, a damage assessment will be conducted to judge the effect that the
   compromise has on national security.
   9.1.2. Suspected instances of unauthorized public disclosure of classified information shall
   be reported promptly and investigated to determine the nature and circumstances of the
   suspected disclosure, the extent of the damage to national security, and the corrective and
   disciplinary action to be taken [DODD 5210.50, Para 4.]
9.2. Definitions.
   9.2.1. Security incidents as used in this AFI pertain to any security violation or infraction as
   defined in EO 12958, as amended. Security incidents may be categorized as:
       9.2.1.1. Security Violation. Any knowing, willful or negligent action:
           9.2.1.1.1. That could reasonably be expected to result in an unauthorized disclosure
           of classified information.
           9.2.1.1.2. To classify or continue the classification of information contrary to the
           requirements of this order or its implementing directives.
           9.2.1.1.3. To create or continue a SAP contrary to the requirements of EO 12958, as
           amended.
       9.2.1.2. Security Infraction. Any knowing, willful or negligent action contrary to the
       requirements of EO 12958, as amended that is not a security violation.
   9.2.2. A compromise of classified information occurs when unauthorized individuals have
   had access to the classified information. Unauthorized individuals include those individuals
   with the appropriate security clearance but do not have a valid need-to-know.
   9.2.3. A potential compromise of classified information is when an investigating official
   concludes that a compromise of classified information has more than likely occurred as a
   result of a security incident.
9.3. Information System (IS) Deviations. Coordinate all security deviations involving
information systems with the local ISPM and the supporting information assurance office to
begin an evaluation on the impact of the incident to national security and the organization‟s
operations. If COMSEC material is involved, refer to AFI 33-212, Reporting COMSEC
Deviations (will be incorporated in AFI 33-201, Volume 3, COMSEC User Requirements)).
9.4. Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) Incidents. Safeguard all SCI material and
report incidents involving SCI to the Special Security Officer.

9.5. Special Access Program (SAP) Incidents Report security incidents involving DOD SAP
materiel through local SAP channels to the Director, Special Programs OUSD(P).
9.6. Classification.
   9.6.1. Classify security incident notices, appointment of inquiry official memorandums, and
   security incident reports at the same level of classification as the information compromised if
   they contain classified information or if they provide sufficient information that would enable
   unauthorized individuals to access the classified information in an unsecured environment. In
   the latter case, the documentation must remain classified until the information has been
   retrieved and appropriately safeguarded. Do not classify memorandums and reports
   pertaining to security incidents that have occurred in the information system environment
   when the system has been appropriately purged and the correspondence does not contain
   other classified information.
       9.6.1.1. Classify security incident notices, memorandums, and reports according to the
       classified source from which they are derived. Refer to DOD 5200.1-R, Chapter 3.
       9.6.1.2. Mark security incident notices, memorandums, and reports using derivative
       classification procedures. Refer to DOD 5200.1-R, Chapter 5.
   9.6.2. All security incident reports will, as a minimum, be marked “For Official Use Only.”
   Refer to DOD Regulation 5400.7/Air Force Supplement, Freedom of Information Act
   Program.
9.7. Public Release. Security incident reports cannot be released into the public domain until
they have undergone a security review [Reference AFI 35-101, Chapter 15.] Unauthorized
disclosure of classified information to the public must be processed IAW DODD 5210.50.
9.8. Reporting and Notifications.
   9.8.1. Personnel who learn of a security incident must immediately report it to their
   commander or equivalent, supervisor, or security manager who will in-turn report the
   incident to the servicing ISPM by the end of the first duty day.

     destruction of classified information, or by any other means that would make it difficult
     to recognize or reconstruct the information.
  A2.1.3. Unauthorized Disclosure. The unauthorized disclosure of FOUO does not constitute
  an unauthorized disclosure of DOD information classified for security purposes. However,
  appropriate administrative action shall be taken to fix responsibility for unauthorized
  disclosure of FOUO whenever feasible, and appropriate disciplinary action shall be taken
  against those responsible. Unauthorized disclosure of FOUO information that is protected by

A8.1. (Added-ACC) CNWDI Definition. DoD 5200.1-R defines CNWDI as "that Top Secret
Restricted Data or Secret Restricted Data revealing the theory of operation or design of the
components of a thermo-nuclear or implosion-type fission bomb, warhead, demolition munition,
or test device. Specifically excluded is information concerning arming, fusing, and firing
systems; limited life components; and total contained quantities of fissionable, fusionable, and
high explosive materials by type. Among these excluded items are the components that DoD
personnel set, maintain, operate, test, or replace." The abbreviation "CNWDI" or its related term
is unclassified.
A8.2. (ACC)Granting CNWDI Access:
   A8.2.1. (Added-ACC) CNWDI is vital information and access is limited to the minimum
   number of persons who need it to do their assigned job.
   A8.2.2. (Added-ACC) Individuals granted CNWDI access must have a final Top Secret or
   Secret security clearance, depending on the level of information they will require. Immigrant
   aliens can be certified for access to CNWDI only by select officials at HQ USAF and above
   levels of command.
   A8.2.3. (Added-ACC) Formal access authorization to CNWDI is given by division chiefs
   and above, and is recorded on AF Form 2583, Request for Personnel Security Action.
   NOTE: Briefer does not require CNWDI access to serve as unit briefer.
   A8.2.4. (Added-ACC) AF Form 2583. Complete Section I, blocks 1 through 7; Section II,
   block 9; Section III, blocks 10 through 14; Section VI, blocks 27 through 29; and Section VII
   by entering the following in block 30:
MEMBER REQUIRES ACCESS TO CNWDI MATERIAL FOR ROUTINE ACCESS.
Briefed according to DoDD 5210.2 and AFI 31-401. Date of briefing _________________.
Signature of person receiving briefing ____________________________________________.
   A8.2.5. (Added-ACC) Keep the AF Form 2583 in unit files for duration of the individual's
   access to CNWDI and dispose of IAW RDS.
A8.3. (Added-ACC) Dissemination of Material. CNWDI material can be disclosed only to
other personnel authorized such access. In cases where visitors require access to CNWDI,
determine if access is authorized by verifying JCAVS, official visit requests, or by contacting the
visitor's parent organization.
A8.4. (ACC)Procedural Requirements. In addition to those requirements already specified
for other classified information, these procedures apply to CNWDI material:
   A8.4.1. (Added-ACC) Marking Material:
       A8.4.1.1. (Added-ACC) Mark portions of classified documents that contain CNWDI
       with "(N)" following the classification; for example, "(S-RD)(N)."
 112                         AFI31-401_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 JUNE 2011


       A8.4.1.2. (Added-ACC) Mark the face or front page of documents that contain
       CNWDI, including unclassified letters of transmittal, with "CRITICAL NUCLEAR
       WEAPON DESIGN INFORMATION-DOD DIRECTIVE 5210.2 APPLIES." This
       marking is in addition to the Restricted Data warning notice.
       A8.4.1.3. (Added-ACC) Mark messages that contain CNWDI with "CNWDI"
       immediately following the overall classification, which is the first item of information in
       the text of electronically transmitted messages.
   A8.4.2. (Added-ACC) Safekeeping and Storage. Protect CNWDI in the same manner
   prescribed for the level of other classified information; however, limit access to such
   containers to only those personnel who have been granted CNWDI access. When containers
   are unlocked, they must be under the direct surveillance of a person authorized CNWDI
   access.
   A8.4.3. (Added-ACC) Compromise of CNWDI Material. Since CNWDI material is
   Restricted Data, the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 governs its use. Always send notifications
   of suspected CNWDI compromises through Security Forces channels to the Directorate of
   Security Forces and Force Protection, Information Security Division (HQ USAF/A7SI).
   A8.4.4. (Added-ACC) Transmission of Material. Show on envelopes or other containers
   enclosing CNWDI the Restricted Data warning notice, the DoD Directive 5210.2 notice (see
   A8.4.1.2. (Added) above), and the notation "To be opened only by personnel authorized
   access to CNWDI material."
   A8.4.5. (Added-ACC) Disposal and Destruction. Ascertain disposal IAW the RDS. In
   addition to the required number of persons to witness destruction of other classified material,
   persons destroying CNWDI or committing this material to a central destruction activity must
   be cleared for CNWDI access.
A8.5. (Added-ACC) CNWDI Debriefings. When access is no longer required, an individual
is debriefed, using AF Form 2587, Security Termination Statement. Maintain the AF Form
2587 IAW RDS.

                                 Attachment 10 (Added-ACC)
     CONSTRUCTION GUIDELINES FOR SECURE CONFERENCE FACILITIES

A10.1. (Added) Objectives. To provide guidelines for the achievement of effective security in
ACC facilities in which collateral classified information is discussed and handled on a daily basis.
Normally, secure conference facilities are only set up at locations where daily classified
conferences or forums occur. The guidance provided herein should be considered when building
new facilities or renovating existing facilities.
A10.2. (Added) Secure Conference Facility. For the purpose of this instruction, a secure
conference facility is defined as an area provided special acoustical, technical, and physical
security protection, and designated for the discussion and handling of classified defense
information on a continuous basis. Due to the high costs of building a secure conference facility,
the number of secure conference facilities will be kept to the absolute minimum consistent with
mission accomplishment.
A10.3. (Added) General Approach. The achievement of adequate security for conference
facilities so as to protect all classified information therein requires a blend of acoustical,
technical, and physical security measures. This blend is obtained through the coordination of
acoustical, electronics, civil engineering, and security personnel from the initial planning stage
through construction and inspection phases. The installation Civil Engineer or Construction
Agent is responsible for the design and construction of secure conference facilities. Qualified
persons should be consulted for solutions to acoustical problems. The installation Civil Engineer,
Construction Agent, or a qualified consultant should be able to help in the solution of acoustical
problems. All elements comprising the physical boundaries of the facility must have a uniformly
low transmission of sound through the exterior envelope (walls, ceiling, floor, and doors) of the
secure space. No utilities should serve as a fortuitous probe to electronic or audio signals
emanating from the secure facility. Physical access to the area must be controlled. Secure
conference facilities will not be constructed adjacent to facilities not under U.S. control. After
architectural plans are complete and before a contract is let, physical and technical security
specialists will review the plans for potential security weaknesses. If uncleared personnel
accomplish the construction, it is recommended that appropriately cleared owner/user personnel
periodically check the facility, with particular emphasis on monitoring the installation of security
items and to preclude the installation of clandestine surveillance devices.
A10.4. (Added) Acoustical Security. Acoustical security deals with all measures necessary to
minimize the loss of intelligible information acoustically radiated within an area through proper
construction techniques.
A10.4.1. (Added) Acoustical security treatment. The following facets of acoustical treatment are
provided as a general guide to achieve adequate acoustical security:
A10.4.1.1. (Added) Doors & Frames. Commercially available doors acoustically rated with a
proper Sound Transmission Class (STC) Laboratory rating shall be used. This rating should be 5
- 7 STC Points higher than the Noise Isolation Class (NIC) objective. One concept employs the
use of a double door system. In this system two doors are mounted back-to-back with wider
doorjambs used. This gives the added advantage of a relatively dead air space between the inner
and outer area and overcomes the direct link from the outside to interior via the door hardware
assemblies, such as locks. Fire rated doors will not be used, as they cannot be made to meet the
 116                          AFI31-401_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 JUNE 2011


required STC rating. Lead sheets on the inner surface of both doors helps to increase the sound
transmission loss. Any items of hardware installed on such doors should not in themselves
create a sound leakage path. Doors are the weakest link in the system and because they have
moving parts, they should be maintained on a scheduled basis. Doors must be acoustically tested
biennially to ensure continuing compliance with required NIC standards.
A10.4.1.2. (Added) Door jambs. Only factory supplied, acoustically rated STC doors that are
delivered in factory-supplied doorframes and that have been STC rated, as a functional unit, shall
be used. The door-frame shall be installed per manufacturer‟s instruction.
A10.4.1.3. (Added) Door thresholds. Wooden thresholds are preferred over metal because of
their lower sound conductivity rating. All thresholds will be sealed at all points of contact with
the floor and door-frame.
A10.4.1.4. (Added) Expansion joints. Conference facilities should not be located where building
expansion joints will form a part of or be immediately against any portion of the facility
perimeters. Such joints cannot be effectively soundproofed on a continuing basis, since the
joints are always subject to gap changes resulting from ambient temperature variations or
building movements.
A10.4.1.5. (Added) Holes or crevices. Holes or crevices in all exterior boundaries should be
completely sealed with elastomeric caulking cement or equivalent mortar of such sufficiency as
to prevent sound leakage and maintain the overall uniformity of sound transmission loss.
A10.4.1.6. (Added) Pipes, ducts, and conduits. Holes or crevices around pipes, ducts, and
conduit passing into any part of the facility should be well sealed as discussed above. All pipes,
ducts, or conduits, must contain a dielectric break (nonmetallic coupling) where passing through
the perimeter wall, or be treated with structural masking. Those pipes remaining inside the
facility, which are surface mounted, should be covered with an effective insulating material to
attenuate the coupling of sound vibrations to the pipe (a possible transmission link from the
facility). However, clean metal-to-metal contact is required where ducts or pipes pass through
electrical shielding. Likewise, all service boxes connected to pipes and conduits should be
covered. When necessary, a short length of pipe leaving a service box should be filled with
fiberglass to attenuate airborne sound transmitted within the pipe.
A10.4.1.7. (Added) Metal beams or posts. The presence of metal beams and posts within the
conference facility should be avoided wherever possible, since they both minimize the utility of a
facility and require acoustical treatment in essentially the same manner as pipes and conduits
mentioned above.
A10.4.1.8. (Added) Radiators. Hot water or steam radiators will not be installed, as they are
difficult to make acoustically secure. The best heating system for security is an electrical heater
within each room, since the electrical power circuits can be more easily made secure.
A10.4.1.9. (Added) Air conditioners. If possible, secure conference facilities should be equipped
with an air conditioning system independent of the master building system. Master building
systems, with all their air supply and return ducts, are more difficult to make secure. A dedicated
air conditioning system should be installed in TOP SECRET areas. The background noise
contribution of the heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems should not exceed 42 dB as
measured inside the secure area.
AFI31-401_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 JUNE 2011                                                117


A10.4.1.10. (Added) Air ducts and ventilation grills. Air ducts and ventilation grills create
severe security problems in that they provide a ready path for the transmission of both airborne
and structure-borne sound energy. All duct penetrations shall be fitted with commercially
available duct silencers having a Dynamic Insertion Loss equal to the specified STC rating of the
secure perimeter itself. The sides of the duct silencer shall have the same STC rating as the
perimeter. A steel screen with ½ inch square mesh will be installed to preclude the introduction
of a clandestine listening device. An approved duct silencer manufactured of non-sound
conductive materials will be used to decouple duct sections where any part of air duct passes
through an exterior boundary of the facility. As an alternative, the ducts may be treated with
structural sound masking at the inside point of penetration.
A10.4.1.11. (Added) Sound system speakers. Speakers should be located as far as practicable
from all air return inlets and, under no circumstances, mounted on perimeter surfaces. They
should be mounted at a point where the sound transmission loss is the greatest (i.e., on a pillar)
and likewise, the greatest levels of sound energy must be directed inward, away from any
exterior walls. , A sound level or volume-unit (VU) meter should be installed as part of the
sound system to assure sound levels of 75dB or below are maintained to avoid nullifying the
acoustical security treatment provided the area. Once the 75 dB is achieved, the volume control
should be secured. Amplified sound shall utilize a well-distributed speaker system (such as
speakers suspended from the ceiling) so that the sound pressure level does not exceed more than
75 dB at any place within the room (certain work areas may require a higher speaker dB).
A10.4.1.12. (Added) Communications devices.              Telephones, intercoms, or any other
communications devices that transmit clear text audio from an area should be kept to an absolute
minimum, consistent with essential operational requirements. Each such device and its planned
location should be considered carefully, for when in use they transmit from the area all
conversations conducted within proximity of the device. No cell phones, camera cell phones,
cordless telephones, or wireless microphones, keyboards, or mice, wireless or Infrared Local
Area Networks (LANs), or devices are allowed in areas where classified information is discussed,
briefed, or processed. “Area” refers to a room and/or to a space the size of a 3-meter radius
sphere, centering on the classified source. In areas where classified information is discussed,
briefed, or processed, wireless pointer/ mice devices are allowed for presentations only. All other
wireless portable/personal electronic devices (PEDs) not specifically addressed above, that are
used for storing, processing, and/or transmitting information shall not be operated in areas where
classified information is electronically stored, processed, or transmitted. Classified information
could unintentionally be transmitted from an area over unsecured communications systems
because of poor planning. Care as to the quantity and location of communications devices, along
with acoustical shells or booths about various work centers, can greatly reduce undesired sound
transmissions via unsecured communication links. During planning stages, the use of secure
communication devices must be considered, i.e. STU III, push to talk, etc.
A10.4.1.13. (Added) Alcoves or sound locks. A small room of suitable size can be provided at
the main entrance door for both access control and the prevention of inadvertent overhearing
whenever the outer door is opened. As an alternative measure, to identify visitors before opening
a single door, either a closed circuit television system or a miniature, wide-angle optical lens
(with a suitable hinged, lockable cover over the inside portion) may be installed in the entrance
door.
A10.4.1.14. (Added) Windows. Windows will not be provided in new construction. When
 118                          AFI31-401_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 JUNE 2011


present in existing construction, windows will be removed or sealed and covered to provide an
NIC rating equal to the surrounding wall area. Where windows must exist, venetian blinds and
masking sound are required in the window area. Installation of man bars outside the windows
should be considered. Completely eliminating the windows and replacing them with similar
construction, as the surrounding wall is preferable. Where windows must exist, venetian blinds
and flameproof heavy drapes (11 oz/sq yd or better) are encouraged to cover such windows
inside the area.
A10.4.1.15. (Added) Ceilings, Walls, and Floors. True walls (structural floor to ceiling) will be
installed in all new construction. For existing structures that do not meet the above requirement,
a cap must be installed providing an NIC rating equal to the walls of the room. The presence of
false ceilings, walls, and floors in new or old construction must be carefully compared against
the total transmission loss afforded.
A10.4.1.16. (Added) Floor trenches. Service or utility trenches of any type under the floor should
be filled, if possible, with concrete. If this cannot be done, masking sound is required.
A10.4.2. (Added) Sound Transmission Class: STC is a numerical rating system for laboratory
determined transmission loss. In this rating system, acoustical security is determined solely by
the attenuation (transmission loss) of airborne speech between the source and a potential listener
outside the perimeter of the facility. The sound transmission loss (TL) of a partition is measured
in 16 third-octave bands between 125 Hertz and 4000 Hertz, with each specific TL figure plotted
in decibels on a graph. The resulting curve should be normalized against a standard curve, with
the overall sound transmission loss expressed as a single figure value called STC (reference:
ASTME E90, E-336, and E-413). The NICs provided in Table 1 are recommended minimums
for secure conference facilities, depending on the level of classification discussed therein, the
sound power level of speech within the area, and the ambient noise level in outside adjacent
areas. Noise reduction tests in accordance with the ASTM E-413 in-to-out test procedures shall
be performed after construction is completed and when modifications are made to the perimeter
surface. The test data should be plotted per ASTM E-413 and expressed in a single number NIC.
NIC is the same as STC except that an STC test is performed on partitions in an acoustical
laboratory, and a NIC test is of a completed structure such as a finished secure facility. Thus,
STC ratings are used to select the wall construction, doors, etc., and NIC is what you get when
the facility is fully assembled. AN ASTM E-336 test procedure shall be conducted on each wall,
floor, ceiling, and perimeter door within the facility. The lowest NIC among the test points shall
be that of the entire facility. Because ambient noise outside an area is a variable, i.e., day vs.
night, duty hours vs. nonduty hours, etc, it may be necessary to employ sound masking
techniques. Such units consist of electronically controlled noise systems or vibration transmitters
installed within the perimeter. The employment of such noise generators in wall voids, doors,
windows, and overhead ducts is a more economical technique to achieve acceptable transmission
losses.
A10.5. (Added) Technical Security. Technical security encompasses those measures necessary
to deny the use of existing technical equipment that may have compromising emanations or the
installation of clandestine technical surveillance devices to collect intelligence from within an
area. The servicing communications activity and Office of Special Investigations should be
contacted for guidance regarding technical security issues during the initial planning stages of
the secure facility. Some guidelines for technical security treatment are as follows:
AFI31-401_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 JUNE 2011                                                   119


A10.5.1. (Added) Electrical services. All electrical wiring should, if at all possible, be run from
a common distribution panel located within the secure discussion area. A single feeder circuit
entering the area should service the panel. Radio frequency filters should be included if any
equipment is located within the secure conference facility that may have possible compromising
emanations. Final determinations of the requirement (or lack thereof) for filters will be made by
the Air Force Communications Agency Certified Technical TEMPEST Authority
(AFCA/CTTA).
A10.5.2. (Added) Communications services. All wires or cables that transmit information to or
from a secure conference facility should be routed to a common distribution frame from which a
single multi-pair cable leaves the area. All obsolete wires should be removed. Unused wires
required for future expansion should be electrically grounded at the distribution frame within the
secure area. All communications systems installed should be the minimum necessary consistent
with essential and efficient operations. All voice systems, incoming or outgoing, secure or
unsecured, should be designed such that when not in use (turned "on") they do not transmit clear
text conversation from the area. Line disconnect jacks on outgoing circuits and isolation
amplifiers on incoming circuits are an effective means to render such systems secure when not in
use. Radio frequency filters should be included if any equipment is located within the secure
conference facility that may have possible compromising emanations.
A10.5.3. (Added) Telephones. All telephones should be equipped with an automatic disconnect
device or a manual plug-type disconnect to disconnect the telephone from the outgoing line.
When disconnects are employed nonresonant external ringers are required. See paragraph
A10.4.1.12. above for further guidance.
A10.5.4. (Added) Shielding. If equipment that unintentionally radiates clear text intelligence is
used in a secure conference facility to process classified information, consideration must be
given to Radio Frequency (RF) shielding the equipment or the facility to contain the
compromising emanations. Although technical security surveys do provide a determination if
any clandestine technical surveillance devices were or currently are in place, they do not provide
protection against future installations or unwitting carriers unless very stringent physical security
and access controls are in effect. One countermeasure, which commanders may consider to
combat clandestine RF transmitters, is the utilization of RF shielding about sensitive conference
sites.
A10.6. (Added) Physical Security: Physical security encompasses those measures necessary to
deny the physical access of unauthorized personnel to a designated area. Physical security can
be achieved through the employment of physical barriers, locking devices, and IDS, or
combinations thereof. Since secure conference facilities are located on Air Force installations
and are not used to store classified information, secure construction requirements IAW DoD
5200.1-R, Appendix 7, are not mandated. However, if ISPMs determine the local threat and
security environment dictates more stringent construction requirements, they may use DoD
5200.1-R, Appendix 7, as a guide for constructing the secure conference facility. Some physical
security guidelines that can be followed for normal threat environments are as follows:
A10.6.1. (Added) Facility Structure. The floor, walls, and roof must be of permanent
construction materials offering resistance to, and evidence of unauthorized entry into the area.
Walls shall be extended to the true ceiling and attached with permanent construction materials.
Windows should not be installed in new secure conference facility construction. Follow the
 120                           AFI31-401_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 JUNE 2011


guidance in paragraph A10.4.1.14. (Added) above for windows in existing construction. Clean,
straightforward construction techniques should be employed. Whenever possible, all utility pipes,
conduits, and related components should be run exposed on interior wall or ceiling surfaces to
minimize exploitation, while facilitating their periodic examination. Likewise, access ports or
doors should be provided to permit the periodic examination within concealed areas, i.e., above
false ceilings, under stages, etc. In general, the secure conference facility should be kept orderly,
with only furniture necessary to minimize concealment locations.
A10.6.2. (Added) Locking Devices. Entrances to the secure conference facility should be kept to
an absolute minimum commiserate with local fire and safety codes. Doors will be substantially
constructed of wood or metal. Doors will be equipped with a locking mechanism to prevent
unauthorized entry into the facility when not in use. Built-in, manipulation-proof, three position
combination locks with an interior safety release turn knob that conforms to GSA Federal
Specifications, FF-L-2740, will be used on entry doors to provide maximum security. Panic
hardware will be installed on the inner side of all emergency doors. Emergency doors will not
have any hardware on the outside of the doors.
A10.6.3. (Added) Door hinges. Door hinges should be installed to deny access to the pivot pin,
as its removal often makes an otherwise very secure door highly susceptible to being opened. If
the hinge pin must be exposed, then it should be fixed to preclude its removal or the door
additionally secured on the hinge side from within.
A10.6.4. (Added) Openings. All openings large enough to permit a person to gain unauthorized
access into an area, 96 square inches or greater, should be appropriately sealed. Either physical
security bars or complete and permanent blockage of the opening is desirable. Special care is
necessary to ensure all utility areas such as steam tunnels, air ducts, air shafts, utility shafts, are
secure, as is the area above a false ceiling. All windows and other openings which exist in
boundary surfaces of a secure conference facility and which adjoin areas of lesser security must
be covered or sealed to deny optical and audio surveillance of classified information therein.
Optical surveillance techniques include the unaided and aided human eye (binoculars, etc,),
photographic and TV cameras, infrared scanners, etc. Audio surveillance techniques include lip
reading, infrared pick-off devices, etc. Protective coverings over all openings should include
glass opaque to infrared or ultraviolet band energy, venetian blinds, and flameproof heavy drapes
(11 oz/sq yd or heavier).
A10.6.5. (Added) Intrusion Detection Alarm System (IDS). Since classified information is not
stored in secure conference room facilities, Intrusion Detection Alarm Systems are not required.
The inclusion of IDS is only recommended when the local threat and security environment
dictates more stringent security requirements to prevent the installation of clandestine technical
surveillance devices. The system should include volume, perimeter, and point sensors.
Proximity and motion detectors provide protection for unique problems. All intrusion alarm
systems should include electrical line supervision between the protected area and monitoring
location. Further, all systems should be capable of sustaining normal operation for 24 hours after
a commercial power loss. All sensors employed must detect an intrusion and be immune to
normal bypass techniques. When used, all intrusion detection alarm systems should be of the
type, and so installed, that they do not transmit intelligence from an area.
AFI31-401_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 22 JUNE 2011                                                 121


A10.7. (Added) Masking Sound Applied to Speech Security. In order to make it impossible to
understand speech outside the secure area, the system design goal must be to reduce speech
intelligibility in all situations, whether it is the result of human listening or listening with
detection devices. Technically, the purpose of masking sound is to reduce the signal-to-noise
ratio of a sound to zero at all pertinent frequencies. In this context, the signal is the speech and
the noise is the masking sound. When the speech intelligibility is zero, the privacy is total and
the signal to noise ratio is zero. This is adequate for direct human listening, but when detection
devices are used and signal-processing techniques are used on the derived signal, it is possible to
improve the signal-to-noise ratio and recover meaning. To keep speech intelligibility at zero, the
masking should be amenable to signal processing techniques that could reduce its effectiveness.
This can be done with a masking signal that is the result of a stationary random process. The
masking signal becomes not only unknowable but cannot be processed with statistical techniques.
Standard masking generators are digital using components in which the signal repeats itself after
one minute. They are called pseudo random controlled noise generators. The sound created by
them may appear random to the listener, but is in fact a deterministic process. Sophisticated
techniques can make use of this deterministic property to increase the speech intelligibility and
thus recover speech. Analog masking generators are somewhat better in that they create a truly
random signal, but suffer from the fact that the signal is Gaussian and stationary, statistical
properties that make signal processing easier. This aspect of the problem is handled in the
equipment generating the masking sound. The most effective method for structural masking is
when random signal vibrations are introduced directly to the perimeter barrier surface to control
background sound levels at potential listening points. The sound masking system and all wires
and transducers shall be located within the perimeter of the facility. Speakers can be located
outside the facility and directed outward as close as practicable to the facility‟s perimeter where
the sound transmission loss is the greatest (i.e. doors, windows, HVAC ducts, electrical and
plumbing conduit, etc.) to achieve the required/desired STC rating. The sound masking system
should only be utilized when the required/desired STC rating is not achievable through physical
security means.
