1. Wing Mission, Commander’s Intent.
     1.1. The mission of the 35th Fighter Wing is to provide worldwide deployable forces, protect
     U.S. interests in the Pacific and defend Japan with sustained forward presence and focused
     mission support. The 35 FW is the host unit at Misawa Air Base, Japan -- the Northernmost
     U.S. air base in Japan, and the only combined, joint service installation in the Western
     Pacific.
     1.2. Commanders will ensure all newly assigned members to their units review the
     Community Standards within 5 days of their arrival. Failure to observe the prohibitions and
     mandatory provisions of this instruction is a violation of Article 92, Uniform Code of
     Military Justice (UCMJ).
35FWI36-2901 28 AUGUST 2014                                                                    3


   1.3. Sponsors are responsible for the safety and well-being of their guests and dependents.
   Sponsors will brief guests and dependents on force protection measures and appropriate
   behavior in Japan.
2. Commander’s Interest Items.
   2.1. Customs and Courtesies.
      2.1.1. We are guests in the country of Japan. Our conduct on and off-duty is extremely
      important to U.S.-Japan relations. All military members, dependents and other civilian
      personnel on Misawa Air Base (hereafter collectively referred to as Misawa personnel)
      are expected to behave in a manner that positively reflects on the DoD and our Nation.
      Under no circumstances will Misawa Air Base personnel engage in disrespectful or
      derogatory action(s), conduct or speech directed towards a Japanese National.
      2.1.2. IAW AFI 1-1, Air Force Standards, during the playing of the national anthems of
      friendly nations, render the same customs and courtesies as those given during the
      playing of the U.S. National Anthem. If in uniform, render a salute. If not in uniform,
      pay proper respect by either saluting or placing your hand over your heart. If you are
      driving a vehicle, stop if consistent with safety and mission requirements.
      2.1.3. When displaying the flag of any nation or U.S. state (e.g., within family housing),
      only the current, official flag may be flown or displayed on Misawa Air Base.
   2.2. Equal Opportunity and Treatment Policy
      2.2.1. It is the responsibility of each member of the Misawa community to promote and
      contribute to a positive human relations climate, free of harassment and discrimination
      based on race, sex, religion, age, color, national origin, ethnic group, mental or physical
      handicap, or sexual orientation. Supervisors at all levels must be committed to this policy
      and work aggressively toward establishing and maintaining a positive human relations
      atmosphere in the work place, and within the community.
      2.2.2. The EO Office staff is tasked with assessing the base human relations climate and
      keeping the Installation Commander informed of any factors which may hinder readiness.
      2.2.3. The Misawa Air Base Installation Commander is committed to keeping our
      community free from the debilitating effects of discrimination and harassment. Anyone
      who has a complaint concerning discrimination or harassment is encouraged to try to
      resolve the matter at the lowest level of supervision, contact his/her first sergeant or
      commander, or file a complaint through EO.
3. Standards.
   3.1. All personnel are expected to uphold standards and represent the DoD and the American
   people with dignity and respect on- and off-duty.
3.2. Public Behavior

      3.2.1. Misawa personnel will not wear clothing, use language or display messages
      (including flags, banners, or streamers) in violation of paragraph 2.2, above.
      Additionally, civilian attire or messaging with explicit or implied sexual references,
      obscene/profane words, or that glamorizes illicit drugs or gang activity is prohibited.
4                                                              35FWI36-2901 28 AUGUST 2014


       3.2.2. Misawa personnel will not play music with inflammatory, profane or derogatory
       lyrics that violate paragraph 2.2, above. Music shall be played at reasonable sound
       volume (heard no more than 20 feet from the vehicle or home) so as not to disturb
       residents of the community.
       3.2.3. Use of inappropriate language (e.g., profanity, racial, or ethnic slurs) is prohibited
       on Misawa Air Base. This includes inappropriate signs, posters, stickers, labels, etc.,
       displayed at on-base housing or on vehicles.
       3.2.4. Applicable service guidance will govern the wear of tattoos for U.S. military
       members on Misawa Air Base. While on Misawa Air Base, civilian members will refrain
       from displaying tattoos that are prejudicial to good order, discipline and morale or are of
       a nature to bring discredit upon the Armed Forces.
       3.2.5. Active Duty members will comply with Service specific guidelines for the wear of
       body piercings (e.g. AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force
       Personnel).
       3.2.6. In public areas, television content must be appropriate for viewing by all age
       groups. When available televisions will use installed technology to block content
       exceeding TV-PG rating. All Misawa Air Base organizations with televisions in public
       areas must block TV-14 and TV- MA content--specifically for (D) dialogue, (L)
       language, (S) sex, and (V) violence. AFN news and sports broadcasts are permissible as
       long as they are appropriate for all audiences. Commanders Access Channel, AFN
       Family and 35 FSS informational channels are authorized.
    3.3. Substance Use and Abuse.
       3.3.1. Drug Abuse.
          3.3.1.1. The unauthorized manufacture, receipt, possession, use, and/or distribution
          of controlled substances on Misawa Air Base by military members, civilian
          employees, contractors, dependents, or visitors to the installation is prohibited.
          Military members who violate this prohibition are subject to discipline under the
          UCMJ. Civilian employees, dependents, and visitors who violate this prohibition are
          subject to United States law, Japanese law, 35 FWI 51-901, and other applicable
          regulations.
          3.3.1.2. Synthetic marijuana, a designer drug, has become a major concern at military
          installations throughout the world. Commonly called K2, Spice, or Fake Weed, this
          synthetic compound contains dangerous chemical components including, HU-210,
          HU-211, JWH-018, and JWH-073. Though often sold at smoke shops or through
          online retailers, this product is illegal. The Drug Enforcement Agency has added the
          chemicals in this drug to the list of Schedule I substances banned by the Controlled
          Substance Act. The manufacture, receipt, possession, use, or distribution of any form
          of synthetic marijuana or like chemical substances on Misawa Air Base by military
          members, civilian employees, contractors, dependents, and visitors will not be
          tolerated and will be subject to disciplinary actions. Other drugs and medication,
          such as “bath salts” and “BRON” are similarly prohibited on Misawa Air Base.
          Furthermore, any use of legal substances purchased over the counter but used for
35FWI36-2901 28 AUGUST 2014                                                                    5


        other than its intended purpose is prohibited. Offenders may be subject to appropriate
        UCMJ action or Misawa Conduct Adjudication Proceeding.
        3.3.1.3. Drug paraphernalia of any kind is prohibited on Misawa Air Base.
     3.3.2. Alcohol Use/Abuse.
        3.3.2.1. A person must be 20 years old to purchase, consume, or possess alcoholic
        beverages on- or off-base. NOTE: Persons 20 years of age or older will not
        purchase or provide alcoholic beverages for personnel under the age of 20 years.
        3.3.2.2. Alcoholic beverages will not be transported in the passenger compartment of
        a vehicle after the original cap, stopper, or seal has been removed or broken.
        (Exception: alcohol with original cap, stopper, or seal removed or broken may be
        transported in the rear-most area of a vehicle that does not have a trunk.)
        3.3.2.3. No alcoholic beverages will be consumed in a vehicle by drivers or
        passengers.
        3.3.2.4. Personnel will not carry open containers of alcoholic beverages outside of
        establishments that serve alcohol. Dormitories (including dormitory picnic and
        barbecue areas), housing units, and approved locations hosting official functions and
        social gatherings may have open containers. However, it is incumbent on the unit or
        person responsible for the event to ensure personnel do not carry open containers
        away from the immediate area, and they properly dispose of empty containers.
        Violators (military, government, civilian and family member civilian) may be subject
        to appropriate disciplinary action. See 35 FWI 34-219 for additional guidance.
     3.3.3. Tobacco Use.
        3.3.3.1. In accordance with AFI 40-102, Tobacco Use In The Air Force, tobacco
        products may not be sold on Misawa Air Base to anyone under the age of 18 (a
        minor). On Misawa Air Base, minors will not be allowed to purchase or use tobacco
        products of any kind. Violations will be reported to Security Forces.
        3.3.3.2. To protect the health of all personnel, AFI 40-102 also prohibits the use of
        all tobacco products (cigars, cigarettes, e-cigarettes, pipes, spit/loose tobacco) inside
        workplaces and public facilities.
        3.3.3.3. Smoking is only authorized on Misawa Air Base in designated tobacco use
        areas. Smoking is prohibited inside all dormitories and Military Family Housing,
        including Senior Officer Quarters and Prestige Housing. The immediate vicinity of
        the base hospital is designated a smoke-free campus.
  3.4. Military Family Housing (MFH) & Appearance
     3.4.1. Appearance.
        3.4.1.1. The appearance of base housing directly reflects installation pride and
        commitment to a safe and well-kept community. Housing appearance will be in

        highlights key points. See the latest MFH brochure for current and complete
        requirements.

       3.4.1.3. Misawa residents will remove snow and ice from sidewalks by 0800 daily.
       Remove snow and ice from steps, driveways, and individual parking spaces as soon
       as possible after accumulation. Remove icicles, ice and snow from roof overhangs
       and door stops to prevent safety hazards.
       3.4.1.4. Make arrangements to ensure grounds maintenance and snow removal are
       accomplished during absences such as temporary duty (TDY), temporary additional
       duty (TAD), leave, etc.
    3.4.2. Policy on Littering, Refuse Collection, Disposal and Recycling.
       3.4.2.1. Misawa residents are expected to maintain their government quarters, dorms
       and work centers in a neat, orderly and clean fashion. Littering, clutter and improper
       waste disposal are not compatible with this objective. Refer to Attachment 7 and the
       current MFH brochure for details.
       3.4.2.2. Hazardous household items will be disposed of IAW Attachment 6.
    3.4.3. Pets in MFH
       3.4.3.1. AFI 32-6001 restricts MFH residents from boarding exotic or farm animals,
       and dogs of any breed deemed “aggressive” or “potentially aggressive”. Refer to AFI
       32-6001 for further details.
       3.4.3.2. General Pet Provisions. All animals owned by Status of Forces Agreement
       (SOFA) personnel must be registered at the base veterinary clinic, maintain
       current vaccinations, and have individual airline carriers for traveling.
       Additionally, all dogs and cats must have an appropriate microchip implant. All pet
       owners must out process through the Veterinary Treatment Facility upon completion
       of their tour.
       3.4.3.3. Dog Parks. The 35 FW currently maintains three dog parks for use by SOFA
       personnel and their dogs. Pet owners may only use these parks in accordance with
       the rules posted outside the entrance to each. Failure of pet owners to police and
       clean up after their dogs may be grounds to close the parks for all users.
       3.4.3.4. Pets must be secured with leashes and under positive control while outdoors,
       except in fenced patios and yards. Pets must not be left tied, unattended or allowed to

35FWI36-2901 28 AUGUST 2014                                                                   7


        jeopardize community tranquility, safety, host-nation relations, the installation
        mission, or is otherwise deemed to be inappropriate for Military Family Housing.
        3.4.4.2. The use of government resources or government facilities for personal gain,
        including a home business, is prohibited. While it is appropriate and acceptable to
        use one’s own residence in a manner that is not disruptive to the community,
        the use of government property, such as a conference room or tower recreation
        room, is not permitted for business use. Conference and meeting rooms can be rented
        from the 35 FSS for these activities.
        3.4.4.3. All U.S. Armed Forces personnel, civilian employees and dependents must
        request permission in writing to run a home business through the 35 CES Housing
        Office.
        3.4.4.4. The Air Force limits home businesses to the sale of products, minor repair
        services on small items, limited manufacturing of items or tutoring.            Home
        businesses may not resell items (or items made from components) obtained through
        the Commissary or AAFES, nor use the APO mail system. Similarly, home
        businesses may not grant access to US facilities and the activities within them (e.g.,
        Fitness Centers, Arts & Crafts, Auto Hobby, etc.) to individuals not otherwise entitled
        to their use.
        3.4.4.5. U.S. Armed Forces personnel, civilian employees and their dependents may
        not engage in buying, selling, brokering, or transferring cars as a commercial
        enterprise. Members may only engage in this activity for purchase and resale of
        POVs for personal use.
  3.5. Firearms, Weapons and Explosive Items.
     3.5.1. Misawa AB Integrated Defense Plan, provides detailed information on firearm,
     weapons and explosive item authorizations and restriction. Misawa Air Base personnel
     who fail to comply with this Instruction are subject to disciplinary action. (See

     Weapons and Illegal, Dangerous and Concealed Weapons.)
     3.5.2. Military family housing occupants may store up to three authorized weapons in

     roller skaters/bladers are required to wear protective helmets in accordance with
     manufacturers’ recommendations.
  4.5. Pacific Ocean and Base Beach Aquatic Activities.
     4.5.1. Due to the powerful ocean rip current in the Pacific Ocean near Misawa, aquatic
     activities can be very dangerous. The following paragraphs comprise Misawa Air Base’s

     south on Route 338, adjacent to the Misawa Fishing Port. (Note: Do not confuse this
     with “Miss Veedol Beach”, located north on Route 338).             Ocean areas south of
     Hachinohe can also be dangerous; swim only in areas designated as “authorized
     swimming areas.” Swimming is permitted at the base beach only in the roped-off
     swimming area.

   4.6.1. See Attachment 5.
5. Control of Family Members and Civilian
   5.1. All family members and civilians will adhere to the established community standards
   for Misawa Air Base. Disrespect and/or physical or verbal abuse for authority will not be
   tolerated.    Similarly, established cases of family maltreatment will not be tolerated.
   Established incidents involving family members and civilians will be reviewed by the
   sponsor’s commander. The seriousness of the incident or maltreatment may result in referral
   to the Misawa Conduct Adjudication Program (MCAP) in accordance with 35 FWI 51-901.
   Sponsors and unit commanders must ensure family members conform to applicable
   regulations and directives. A minor is any family member child under 18 years of age. Refer
   to the Age Matrix (Attachment 1, Age Matrix for Staying Home Alone) for specific
   instructions on responsibilities for leaving family member children in vehicles, quarters,
   unaccompanied outside, and for child sitting. Any violations of the rules outlined in this
   matrix should be reported to Security Forces.
   5.2. Gross misconduct or disrespect for authority (teachers, recreation or youth activities
   staff, facility managers, supervisors, security forces, commanders, other officers, senior
   noncommissioned officers, and mass transit bus drivers) will be considered a violation of this
   instruction, as well as an aggravation to other violations that may have been committed.
   Gross misconduct includes, but is not necessarily limited to, profanity or physical contact.
   5.3. A minor found violating this instruction may be detained by Security Forces. Security
   Forces will contact the minor's sponsor or the sponsor's first sergeant, commander, or enlisted
   superintendent, and release the child to one of them. Documented acts of misconduct or
   disrespect for authority will be handled by the agency concerned (e.g., unit commanders,
   associate units, etc.). Misconduct will be referred to the MCAP when appropriate.
   5.4. Violations will be handled in accordance with 35 FWI 51-901 or AFI 40-301, Family
   Advocacy. Violations may result in the termination of base privileges and/or debarment.
   5.5. The following curfew hours have been established for minors:
      5.5.1. Curfew the night prior to a school day will be from 2300 to 0500 and the night
      prior to a non-school day will be 2400 to 0500.
      5.5.2. During curfew hours, no minor will be out of doors (including being inside a
      motor vehicle) except as follows:
          5.5.2.1. The minor is accompanied by his/her sponsor or a responsible adult
          appointed by the sponsor.
          5.5.2.2. If employed, the minor will have 30 minutes to return to his/her quarters
          after termination of work.

          5.5.2.3. A minor participating in official functions that extend after curfew hours will
          have 30 minutes to return to his/her quarters after termination of the function.
   5.6. Sponsors are responsible for their children while they are out of their direct supervision.
   Children are not allowed to play in base housing stairwells, hallways, elevators, vehicle
   underpasses, lobbies, garbage collection rooms, or other locations that may be dangerous or
   harmful (e.g., locations specifically designated off limits, construction areas, abandoned
   houses, main roads/intersections, etc.).
   5.7. Minors age 16 and up may be left alone for short TDYs or leaves, not to exceed 5
   consecutive days. These minors must have some type of adult supervision to make periodic
   checks. Any child or children involved in, or documented as, “Misconduct Cases” will not
   be left alone without adult supervision.
6. Public Transportation.
   6.1. The 35 FW does not operate a base shuttle service. Misawa personnel may take
   advantage of the AAFES taxi service for many of their needs. Additionally, the 35 LRS also
   runs the Official Duty Taxi Service for official business needs. See Attachment 9 for further
   details.

Figure A3.1. Age Matrix For Control Of Minor Family Members*
The welfare and safety of children in the military community are the shared responsibility of the
command and parents/sponsors. The Family Advocacy Committee (FAC) and Resilient Airmen
Council have established the following minimum age requirements for greater levels of
unsupervised activities by our children. Each child is unique; personality, environment,
developmental progress, and maturity level are factors used to determine when children are ready to
accomplish activities with little or no supervision. Parents are still advised to assess their children
and if necessary, raise the age limit.

                             CONSTRUCTION SITE SAFETY

A6.1. Construction sites on Misawa Air Base: May be present at any time or any season.
These sites can be extremely hazardous, with risks including open pits, heavy equipment,
hazardous chemicals, and falling materials/tools. Construction sites are marked with signs,
barriers, tape, cones, and/or other obvious devices. In the event a site is not clearly marked,
assume a 50-foot standoff from operating equipment or personnel.
A6.2. Active duty military, civil service or JN civilians, or dependent personnel: Not
directly participating in construction or construction inspection activities are prohibited from
entering or traversing any construction site, whether active or temporarily inactive due to
darkness, adverse weather, or other cause, unless one of the following conditions is met:
   A6.2.1. Escorted by an authorized Government inspector, craftsman, or contracting officer.
   All safety requirements must be met (hardhat, steel toed boots, eye protection, etc.).
   A6.2.2. Passing through a marked transit path, either on foot or in a vehicle. Be wary at all
   times of contractors and equipment working in the area that may not be aware of your
   presence.
   A6.2.3. Unauthorized personnel entering a construction site will be treated as if they were
   inappropriately entering any other controlled area on base, and may be detained by the
   Security Forces and/or receive administrative or non-judicial punishment depending on the
   severity of the offense.
   A6.2.4. Obey all construction flag-person personnel when walking or operating a vehicle in
   the vicinity of an active construction site. Contractor personnel will use wands, flags and/or
   hand signals to control movement. Standard Misawa traffic regulations apply when passing
   slow-moving construction equipment.
   A6.2.5. Parents, or guardians, including baby sitters, should be especially attentive with
   young children around construction sites. Scaffolding, equipment, soil piles, etc. are
   attractive as play areas, and children who might otherwise be safely left to play outside alone
   may be tempted to enter a construction site without any awareness of its inherent dangers.

  POLICY ON LITTERING, REFUSE COLLECTION, DISPOSAL AND RECYCLING

A7.1. How we feel about ourselves and where we work and live: Is greatly influenced by our
physical surroundings. If we have neat, orderly, and clean surroundings, we feel better about
ourselves, our jobs, and our place in the community. Clutter or disarray erodes confidence in our
ability to properly take care of our affairs, and displays a lack of pride in our community and
ourselves.
A7.2. Refer to the current Military Family Housing handbook for details.
A7.3. The ground rules regarding litter are simple. If you drop it or see it, pick it up; if
you’re responsible for any trash or a mess, clean it up. If you are responsible for a specific area,
keep it clean and neat. This also means responsibility for ensuring litter is disposed of properly.
Designated Facility Managers are responsible for the condition of grounds surrounding their
building. Their responsibility consists of all areas within 150’ of the structure or halfway to a
neighboring organization’s facility. Weekly, or upon request by Civil Engineer Squadron (IAW
35 FWI 32-6003, Grounds Maintenance), Facility Managers or their designated agents will
perform grounds maintenance consisting of, but not limited to, weed eating all flower beds, curbs
and gutters, mowing all grass areas, picking up all trash, mower clippings and branches,
sweeping sidewalks, streets, and parking lots, and controlling the removal of snow and ice form
sidewalks and steps. Receiver will not place any clippings or other debris in draining structures.
A7.4. Public areas are not trash areas. Do not dump ashtrays in parking lots or on streets and
don’t leave refuse in public areas; throw it in trash cans.
A7.5. Everyone is expected to pitch in and pick up trash when we see it. The Misawa
standard for cleanliness requires a team effort to keep the installation litter-free.
A7.6. An amnesty box is available for the disposal of unauthorized airline carry on items.
This amnesty box is located inside building 949 through the east personnel door and is only
accessible during normal business hours. Do not throw items in the amnesty box that should be
recycled or put in regular trash receptacles.
A7.7. Littering, Refuse Collection, Disposal, and Recycling.
