Chapter 1 Introduction and History of the
          Engineering Flight
1.1   The History of                 Over the years, the Engineering Flight has run the gauntlet
      Engineering Flight             of change and reorganization due to downsizing with the
                                     current configuration fallout from the Office of Secretary of
                                     Defense (OSD) Defense Management Review Decision
                                     (DMRD) 967 study. The OSD 1990 management study
                                     proposed six major initiatives:
                                     (1)     the creation of public work centers,
                                     (2)     zonal maintenance,
                                     (3)     multiskilling of military workforce,
                                     (4)     creating Maintenance Engineering Element,
                                     (5)     military reduction of 21,800 positions, and
                                     (6)     a savings of $2.4 billion within a six-year period.

                                     As a result of this study, the current configuration of the
                                     Civil Engineering Squadron evolved. After an evaluation
                                     of DMRD 967, the Air Force concluded what was proposed
                                     by the study would severely degrade wartime capability
                                     and responsiveness to customer needs. The initiative
                                     offered by the Air Force as a counter-proposal maintained
                                     the intent of OSD, without compromising readiness and
                                     responsiveness. The Air Force initiatives included:
                                     (1)     reducing the functional layers,
                                     (2)     reducing the number of career fields from 17 to 10,
                                     (3)     reorganizing based on tasks instead of skills,
                                     (4)     increasing productivity of individuals and teams,
                                     (5)     reducing military strength from 28,950 to 22,765,
                                     (6)     saving $915 million within a six-year period,
                                     (7)     increasing war fighting capability, and
                                     (8)     increasing customer satisfaction.

                                     It was the superb efforts of the various Civil Engineering
                                     (CE) study groups that resulted in the Air Force’s redirec-
                                     tion effort and their acceptance by OSD. DMRD 967 was
                                     the catalyst that caused the CE community to re-examine
                                     their organization philosophies and concepts and to repos-
                                     ture the Base Civil Engineer (BCE) for the demands of the
                                     21st century.

                                     The Civil Engineering Squadron reorganization under the
                                     objective squadron concept, the realignment of manpower,
                                     skills, training, and responsibilities, was developed to

                                     achieve the efficiencies and customer satisfaction standards
                                     demanded from a service organization.

1.2   The Objective                  The approval and implementation of the objective squadron
      Squadron                       structure developed a basic and standard capability
                                     throughout the Air Force. A major concern at all command
                                     levels is the ability to meet mission demands in a timely
                                     and efficient manner in an era of diminishing resources.
                                     Sophisticated weaponry and new technologies continue to
                                     drive the need for innovative management techniques under
                                     austere funding conditions. Imagination, discipline, and
                                     foresight, forged with a can-do attitude, create the envi-
                                     ronment necessary to achieve desired goals.

                                     The objective squadron was formed to improve job accom-
                                     plishment and centralize the work or the mission. The ob-
                                     jective was to reduce unnecessary or redundant supervisory
                                     positions, multicraft and multiskill the workforce, and im-
                                     plement better, business-like practices to the process asso-
                                     ciated with work accomplishment. The reorganization of
                                     CE into its current eight-flight configuration marked a ma-
                                     jor improvement in the CE structure. Previously, the focus
                                     of CE on functions resulted in some inefficiencies. To be-
                                     come more efficient and customer focused, the new struc-
                                     ture consolidates functions and crafts by products, such as
                                     readiness, environmental, and resources. The centralized
                                     shop structure in the Operations Flight was changed to em-
                                     phasize product-oriented, multiskilled teams. The Mainte-
                                     nance Engineering Element in the Operations Flight was
                                     established to link the technical engineering expertise with
                                     the practical craftsmen work accomplishment and to place
                                     greater emphasis and management on the often neglected
                                     infrastructure program. Engineering embarked on a cradle-
                                     to-grave process for design and construction management

                                     positions are shown in the scoreboard boxes for each flight.

1.5   Mission Statement              The Engineering Flight provides for cradle-to-grave techni-
                                     cal, design, and construction surveillance of operations and
                                     maintenance projects by contract and simplified acquisition
                                     of base engineering requirements (SABER) projects. Also
                                     included are the management and preparation of technical
                                     data, studies, and evaluation of these projects’ base com-
                                     munity and comprehensive planning and programming.

                                     The Engineering Flight provides the planning, program-
                                     ming, design, and construction in support of facilities,
                                     utilities, airfields, and roadways at each installation within
                                     the Air Force. The supported systems provide the basic
                                     platform from which all Air Force missions are developed,
                                     planned, provisioned, and launched. Facilities range from
                                     basic administrative space to state-of-the-art aircraft, in-
                                     dustrial, laboratory, and test structures.

                                     As an integral part of accomplishing the mission, the Engi-
                                     neering Flight must interface with all levels of every activ-
                                     ity assigned to the installation. They must be intimately fa-
                                     miliar with the goals and missions of the organizations, as
                                     well as have the technical ability to provide high quality
                                     engineering solutions to complex system and mission
                                     problems.

Chapter 2 Responsibilities and Objectives of
          Contracts Element
2.1     Mission Statement            The overall mission of the Engineering Flight is to plan,
                                     develop, and manage contract programs to construct, im-
                                     prove, and maintain base facilities and resources in support
                                     of the Air Force mission. The Contracts Element is tasked
                                     with the overall management of construction contracts
                                     under the cradle-to-grave concept. Under this procedure,
                                     projects are initiated, designed, and constructed by the as-
                                     signed team until completed and accepted by the govern-
                                     ment.

2.2     Design Team                  In the team concept, the project designer, engineering as-
        Responsibilities             sistant, and construction inspector/QAE, who are initially
                                     assigned a project, will be responsible through construction
                                     completion. The Chief of Contracts will temporarily adjust
                                     project assignments to cover these situations. The minimum
                                     allotted time for project design should be 60 percent for
                                     junior engineers and 50 percent (allowing ten percent for
                                     leader duties) for team leaders. The remaining non-design
                                     percentage should be dedicated to construction manage-
                                     ment support (i.e - meetings, submittals, site visitations),
                                     consultation, suggestion evaluations, training, and other
                                     additional taskings.

2.2.1    Project Designer/           The project designer/project manager is responsible for a
         Project Manager             project from the inception of the design to construction
                                     completion. The project designer is responsible for ensur-
                                     ing the project design progresses according to the estab-
                                     lished design completion schedule. The project designer
                                     will continually inform the Chief of Contracts of any situa-
                                     tion which will delay the completion dates. The project
                                     designer will ensure the following tasks are accomplished:
                                     (1)     Visit and discuss the project scope with the cus-
                                             tomer before starting design work; relevant site
                                             conditions are noted.
                                     (2)     Accomplish the design reviews in accordance with
                                             internal operating procedures and as further de-
                                             scribed in more detail later in this pamphlet. It is
                                             the project designer’s responsibility to initiate and
                                             monitor the base review process and ensure timely
                                             completion.
                                     (3)     Upon project funding, ensure the project is appro-
                                             priately processed, attend the pre-construction con-

                                            ference, and along with the construction inspec-
                                            tor/QAE, make at least one visit to the site each
                                            week.
                                     (4)    Ensure the construction inspector/QAE receives as-
                                            sistance in development of any modifications that
                                            may occur during the construction. Chief of Con-
                                            tracts is provided with up-to-date construction status
                                            for maintenance of contracts in the WIMS/PCMS or
                                            ACES/PM database.

2.2.2   Engineering                  Each design team includes an engineering assistant(s). The
        Assistant (EA)               assistant’s typical duties will include the following:
                                     (1)     Obtain for the project designer all pertaining as-
                                             built drawings from the record files.
                                     (2)     Conduct proper preliminary and final surveys of the
                                             project site in accordance with accepted engineering
                                             practices.
                                     (3)     Maintain and safeguard old sketches, notes, and
                                             red-lined review sheets developed during the design
                                             phase.
                                     (4)     Follow applicable drafting standards in accordance
                                             with current policy and procedures.
                                     (5)     Ensure drawings are correctly filed and numbered.
                                     (6)     Coordinate with all reviewing agencies for signature
                                             approval.
                                     (7)     Upon project funding, reproduce and forward the
                                             appropriate number of copies of 100% drawings
                                             and specifications to the base contracting office.

2.2.3   Construction                 The main responsibility of the team’s construction inspector
        Inspector/Quality            or sometimes referred to as the Quality Assurance Evalua-
                                     tor (QAE) is to ensure the government receives quality and
        Assurance Evaluator
                                     completed work, as outlined in government-produced con-
        (QAE)                        tract documents (i.e., specifications and project drawings).
                                     This is accomplished through management procedures and
                                     policies that extend from design throughout the life of the
                                     facility. Policies must be established to facilitate quality
                                     construction and to monitor the effectiveness of manage-
                                     ment techniques. The senior construction inspector or su-
                                     pervisor of the section shall:
                                     (1)      Standardize and implement inspection policies, and
                                              ensure new personnel are properly trained.
                                     (2)      Maintain construction operating instruction.
                                     (3)      Ensure overall quality control of the PCMS/PM
                                              database.

2.3     Design Procedures            The following provides a general overview of the Contracts
        Overview                     Element design processes and procedures. The project de-
                                     signer and associated team member must become thor-
                                     oughly familiar with all internal flight operating instruc-
                                     tions to completely understand the project execution proc-
                                     ess.

2.3.1    Introduction                There are two primary methods to design projects for con-
                                     tract action. Designs can be accomplished with either an
                                     in-house design team or by a commercial Architect-
                                     Engineer (A-E) design firm.

                                     The term "in-house design" refers to a design done by the
                                     Civil Engineer squadron personnel. The design team pro-
                                     vides design services for a client on the base (using
                                     agency).

                                     A-E design refers to work contracted to a private A-E firm,
                                     usually via one of the Flight’s open-end contracts. With
                                     A-E work, the government’s project engineer ensures that
                                     the same design effort is carried out, only the work is per-
                                     formed by an A-E firm. The project designer’s main re-
                                     sponsibilities are writing the statement of work (SOW),
                                     preparing the design fee estimate, assisting contracting in
                                     negotiating the design fee, reviewing and coordinating de-
                                     sign submittals, and processing the 100 percent design
                                     documents for contract action.

                                     The project designer ensures that the A-E prepares contract
                                     documents per the general instruction for delivery orders
                                     for indefinite delivery A-E services contract. The project
                                     designer must then evaluate the A-E performance using an
                                     DD Form 2631, Performance Evaluation (Architect-
                                     Engineer). If design flaws are discovered during construc-
                                     tion or after completion, the project designer is responsible
                                     for working with contracting to ensure corrections are initi-
                                     ated through the A-E and/or that A-E liability damages are
                                     pursued.

2.3.2    Project Assignment          Projects are assigned by the Chief of the Contracts Ele-
                                     ment. All projects must have an approval document, either
                                     a DD Form 1391 or an AF Form 332, Base Civil Engineer
                                     Work Request, prior to design initiation. In an emergency

                                     situation, the project designer may begin design on a proj-
                                     ect prior to its formal approval on paper. In this case, the
                                     project designer is required to aid in the generation of the
                                     approval documents.

                                                                   NOTE
                                       If a project is classified as a Military Construction
                                       (MILCON) project, see Section 2.8 of this AFPAM for
                                       details.

2.3.3   Project                      Prior to design start, an initial investigation should be per-
        Familiarization              formed for a better understanding of the project require-
                                     ments. This step consists of two parts, research and organi-
                                     zation of information.

                                     Research for project design can be found in several sources.
                                     (1)    the information in the DD Form 1391,
                                     (2)    the AF Form 332,
                                     (3)    backup information project files,
                                     (4)    the Contract Programmer in Base Development,
                                     (5)    similar past projects,
                                     (6)    as-built drawings on the subject facilities, and
                                     (7)    initial product information (available in the Sweet’s
                                            Catalogue volumes or CD ROM database).

                                     In all cases, the research should include a visit to the site
                                     for initial investigation of conditions prior to the pre-design
                                     conference.

                                     When renovating spaces with many users (i.e., offices or
                                     administrative areas), the project should be discussed with
                                     all the potential users, not just the Commander or any other
                                     single individual. This can reveal potential problems that
                                     might not be identified until the construction stage or later.

                                     Familiarity with all applicable regulations, Air Force In-
                                     structions, Engineering Technical Letters, manuals, and
                                     codes which may govern design decisions on the project is
                                     important.

                                     Another source of valuable information are the work center
                                     personnel in the Operations Flight. These people have first
                                     hand experience in the maintenance and repair of the base
                                     facilities. Their inputs can save valuable time and expense.

                                     Organization of information is a key to both an efficient
                                     design process and inclusion of all design requirements

                                      down and ultimately filed in the project files for potential
                                      future reference. Files shall be maintained in accordance
                                      with CEC administrative/operating procedures. Whenever
                                      a folder is removed from central files, the properly com-
                                      pleted pink slip must be inserted so the location of the file
                                      is known. When the project familiarization stage is com-
                                      plete, the project is considered to be at the ten percent
                                      stage.

                                     Brooks A-E Act. Construction phase services are broadly
                                     defined as services provided by A-E firms, in-house per-
                                     sonnel, construction management firms, or other sources
                                     during the construction of a project. Funding for such
                                     services depends upon whether these services are provided
                                     for the purpose of completing the design effort or assuring
                                     contractor compliance with requirements. The following
                                     section addresses types of A-E services and funding criteria
                                     in greater detail.

          Limitation                 portion of the A-E’s fee for direct design services to six
                                     percent of the estimated cost of the construction project for
                                     producing and delivering designs, plan, drawings, and
                                     specifications needed for a construction project. FAR
                                     15.404-4 and DFARS 236.606-70 provide additional guid-
                                     ance. The record of negotiations and the government esti-
                                     mate must clearly show that the cost of direct design serv-
                                     ices does not exceed the six percent limitation.

                                     The following are examples of A-E services that are not

                                     from the A-E fee when determining compliance with the
                                     six percent limitation. These services, as well as direct de-

2.3.4.2   Selection Process          The selection process for acquiring A-E services is initiated
                                     by a public announcement, as required by the Brooks Act.
                                     Public Law 92-582, as amended, establishes a policy di-
                                     recting each agency to “publicly announce all requirements
                                     for architectural and engineering services and to negotiate
                                     contracts for architectural and engineering services on the
                                     basis of demonstrated competence and qualification for the
                                     type of professional services required and at a fair and rea-
                                     sonable price.” The Commerce Business Daily (CBD) is
                                     the public notification media by which the U.S. Govern-
                                     ment agencies identify most proposed contract actions and
                                     contract awards. Public announcement requirements are
                                     broken into two categories:
                                     (1)     Fees expected to not to exceed $25,000. The con-
                                             tracting officer shall comply with FAR 5.101(a)(2)

                                    The pre-selection board develops and adopts an evaluation
                                    procedure and conducts an evaluation. Evaluation is based
                                    on qualifications data maintained on file for up to one year
                                    and data submitted by firms responding to the CBD an-
                                    nouncement. The chairperson briefs the members on the
                                    evaluation procedures and point system. To ensure objec-
                                    tivity, each firm will be evaluated on the information con-
                                    tained in the SF Form 254s, the SF Form 255s, the DD
                                    Form 2631 (ACASS evaluation), the ranked A-E selection
                                    evaluation criteria, and other data required in the CBD syn-
                                    opsis or other public notification. The pre-selection board
                                    must rank the selection evaluation criteria in the order
                                    identified in the public announcement; each selection crite-
                                    rion item must be equal to or less than the criterion item
                                    listed above it. When complete, three to six qualified A-E
                                    firms should be recommended to the selection board.

                                    The selection board makes recommendations for final se-
                                    lection from the list provided by the pre-selection board.
                                    The chairperson briefs the members on the evaluation proc-
                                    ess and point system, and the selection board develops its
                                    own evaluation procedure of the short-listed A-E firms.
                                    The selection board conducts its evaluation based on the
                                    same materials considered by the pre-selection board, plus
                                    interviews. The selection board must conduct interviews
                                    with the top three firms under consideration as part of their
                                    evaluation process. These interviews may be conducted by
                                    telephone.

                                    The chairperson submits a summation of all board actions,
                                    identifying the top-ranked firms (minimum of three) in de-
                                    scending order as the best qualified. The summation, all
                                    evaluation forms, and minutes are annotated FOR

2.3.4.4   Open-end                   Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts
          Contracts                  can be used when the base has a variety of small and recur-
                                     ring requirements, including maintenance, repair, and mi-
                                     nor construction. However, a definite statement of work
                                     cannot be produced prior to the contract and the precise
                                     quantities of A-E services needed during the contract pe-
                                     riod cannot be made. IDIQ contracts must comply with
                                     procedures for selection for fees greater than $25,000 (two
                                     selection boards).

                                     There is no prohibition to awarding more than one IDIQ at
                                     a given base. Current IDIQ contracts include the initial
                                     contract year, plus four option years. Maximum fee limita-
                                     tions are $750,000 per contract year and $299,000 per de-
                                     livery order. The initial delivery order in any contract or
                                     option year is limited only by the contract year amount.
                                     When multiple A-E contracts are awarded from one solici-
                                     tation, the maximum fee limitations apply separately to
                                     each contract.

                                     HQ USAF/ILE and SAF/AQC may grant waivers to these
                                     limitations when justified by unusual circumstances and
                                     requirements. The number of IDIQ contracts a base may
                                     have in place generally is limited only by the requirement
                                     that sufficient A-E workload exists to justify the multiple
                                     contracts.

2.3.4.5   Contract                   Upon approval of the A-E selection, the contracting officer
          Negotiation                and project engineer, or designated representative as tech-
                                     nical advisor, meet with the A-E of highest priority selected
                                     and attempt to negotiate an equitable contract. If satisfac-
                                     tory negotiations cannot be concluded with the top ranked
                                     A-E, the negotiations are formally terminated and initiated
                                     with the A-E of second highest priority.

2.3.5     Pre-Design                 The pre-design conference is scheduled to ensure all inter-
          Conference                 ested agencies have an initial input into the project design
                                     at an early stage. The greater the number of agencies in-
                                     volved, the greater the chances of conflict between the re-
                                     quirements of each. Conflicts in requirements should be
                                     resolved at this conference. Later, as the design process
                                     progresses, the changes become more expensive (See Sec-
                                     tion 2.4 of this AFPAM for guidance on the entire design
                                     review process).

                                     It is the project designer’s responsibility to decide which
                                     agencies should be involved in the pre-design conference
                                     and the formality of that conference. Smaller projects need
                                     only a single meeting with only the using agency. A key to
                                     efficient design is to bring in the other engineers who will
                                     be working on the project as soon as possible. This allows
                                     them to “get a feel” for the project, present any of their
                                     ideas for incorporation which may affect the work of oth-
                                     ers, and prepare the best possible work schedule for the de-
                                     sign.

                                     The lead project designer should coordinate and schedule
                                     other engineers on the project to attend the pre-design con-
                                     ference. Of paramount importance is the constant close
                                     contact with all members of the design team. Communica-
                                     tion among team members will reduce the potential for er-
                                     ror caused by overlapping of each discipline’s requirements
                                     and will also enlighten the engineering staff regarding some
                                     of the problem areas faced by the team members.

                                     The project designer has three main tasks for the pre-design
                                     conference.

2.3.5.1    Conference Set-up         The first task is to set up the pre-design conference and in-
                                     form all agencies of the time and place. The number of
                                     agencies will determine the location of the conference. The
                                     best location for a pre-design conference is at the site or at
                                     the using agency if that agency can accommodate the num-
                                     ber of people. Notification for the conference should be by
                                     letter with a lead time of a week to ten days. If time per-
                                     mits, a courtesy follow-up phone call is usually appreci-
                                     ated. The list of attendees will vary with each project. As
                                     a minimum, the following list of agencies should be invited
                                     to attend:
                                     (1)     using agency or agencies (all projects);
                                     (2)     project engineers (all disciplines involved);
                                     (3)     construction inspector/QAE for the project;

                                     (4)    the A-E Firm representatives (if used)
                                     (5)    Environmental Flight;
                                     (6)    Fire Protection Flight(on most projects);
                                     (7)    Operations Flight (especially, the affected shops);
                                     (8)    Base Communications;
                                     (9)    Bioenvironmental (optional); and
                                     (10)   Others: This might include the Base Safety Office
                                            (Ground/Flight), Security Forces, and Base Opera-
                                            tions, as needed.

2.3.5.2   Conference                 The second task of the project designer is to prepare for the
          Preparation                pre-design conference. In preparing for the pre-design con-
                                     ference, the project leader should keep in mind the goals of
                                     the conference.

                                     The conference should ensure the project requirements, as
                                     identified in the programming documents, are current and
                                     valid. It should determine the flexibility of the cost identi-
                                     fied, if any, based on the project designer’s preliminary cost
                                     estimate. If a discrepancy of greater than 25 percent is dis-
                                     covered between this estimate and the programming docu-
                                     ment, the project designer/manager must immediately con-
                                     sult with Base Development for re-accomplishment.

                                     The pre-design conference should also identify any further
                                     requirements which may be applicable to the project.
                                     These include the base Architectural Compatibility Stan-
                                     dards and Interior Design Standards that may impact the
                                     project. Base Development can also supply any other re-
                                     quirements for the facility. Any work orders which can be
                                     incorporated with the design should then be included. Any
                                     conflicts which may arise concerning the project should be
                                     resolved and points of contact for any future information
                                     needed should be identified.

                                     The final goals of the pre-design conference are the deter-
                                     mination of the need for project phasing; ensuring critical
                                     facilities or components are identified; and determining if
                                     asbestos, lead based paint, or other environmental issues
                                     are present in this project. The currently established proce-
                                     dures for Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP)
                                     must also be followed.

2.3.5.3   Conduct the                The third task of the project designer, during the pre-design
          Conference                 conference, is to chair the meeting and record the pertinent
                                     discussions. Upon opening the conference, the project de-
                                     signer will obtain a roster of attendees, briefly defines the

                                     have already been identified.

                                     The meeting should then be open for discussion on the
                                     project requirements or any other problems or concerns that
                                     should be addressed. The meeting should be brief and con-
                                     cluded as soon as the conference goals are met. The result
                                     should be a binding decision on all major points and identi-
                                     fication of open questions which may require resolution at

                                     Following the conference, the project designer (in-house or
                                     A-E) will write the minutes and include a copy in the proj-
                                     ect folder. The minutes should include:
                                     (1)     the project number;
                                     (2)     the title (should agree with DD Form 1391);
                                     (3)     the date of the pre-design conference;

2.3.6   Project Design to            Following the pre-design conference, the project designer
        Conceptual Stage             should now take the information from that meeting, to-
                                     gether with all the resources at-hand, and outline a plan of
                                     attack. This plan should include what needs to be done and
                                     in what order to accomplish the task and what assistance
                                     will be required from others. The site should be visited
                                     frequently during design. These visits aid the project de-
                                     signers in gathering and using accurate information and
                                     also provides the Civil Engineer visibility to the using
                                     agencies. This should also be done on A-E-designed proj-
                                     ects. Validation that all existing conditions have been ad-
                                     dressed is critical. All dimensions and locations on as-
                                     builts must be verified. At the conceptual design stage, the
                                     project should be well scoped. What needs to be done
                                     should be identified, as well as the requirements to be de-
                                     lineated.

                                    mate, and design analysis should be concurrently devel-
                                    oped. When drafting assistance is required, the project de-
                                    signer should accurately sketch and label the drawings to
                                    be given to the team engineering assistant. The engineering
                                    assistant should not have to make decisions. The project
                                    designer should do this prior to handing work over to the
                                    team.

                                    When writing specifications, the title and project number
                                    must agree exactly with the DD Form 1391. Specifications
                                    are to be prepared using office master specs, Corps of En-
                                    gineers (COE) specifications, or Navy Facilities Engineer-
                                    ing Command (NAVFAC) specifications, or appropriate
                                    commercial specifications. COE and NAVFAC specifica-
                                    tions are available in the Construction Criteria Base (CCB)
                                    database. The National Institute of Building Sciences
                                    (NIBS) maintains the CCB. The CCB is available on the
                                    NIBS web site at http://www.nibs.org or by CD-ROM and
                                    DVD distributed quarterly by NIBS. The date, drawing
                                    numbers, and titles referenced must agree exactly with the
                                    drawings. If the section required is not available, one
                                    should be prepared and edited for the master specification
                                    collection and saved for future use. Reference publications
                                    must be the latest issue and there cannot be duplicate con-
                                    tract clauses in the specifications.

                                    For expediency, the preferred method is to appropriately
                                    specify an item on the drawings. Specifications should re-
                                    flect well researched and well thought out decisions. It is
                                    the responsibility of the project designer to question unfa-
                                    miliar items.

                                    After specifications are completed, the project designer
                                    should proofread the specifications to ensure correctness
                                    prior to preparation of project packages. If errors are found
                                    in master specs, they should be corrected on the master.
                                    Before corrections to the masters are made, the Chief of
                                    Contracts should be contacted for approval to make the
                                    changes.

                                    The saying, "a picture is worth a thousand words," holds
                                    true for contract drawings. They are used to relay informa-
                                    tion and instructions to the contractors. If a drawing does
                                    not read well, it is practically useless. Drawings should be
                                    clean and concise. Detailing should be sufficient to explain
                                    the desired finished construction product.

                                    All drawing packages should contain a location plan. All
                                    views should be clearly marked: floor plans, elevations,
                                    sections, and scale. Drawing numbers are obtained by the
                                    team’s engineering assistant and entered on each sheet.
                                    Each sheet should be titled and the number of drawings
                                    should be kept to a minimum.

                                    The AF Form 66, Schedule of Material Submittals, is man-
                                    datory for all projects requiring submittals. This constitutes
                                    notice to the contractor of their requirements for submittals.
                                    All submittals required in the specifications should be listed
                                    and the contract reference and the number of copies re-
                                    quired of each submittal specified. The submittals required
                                    in division one of the specifications must be included. Four
                                    copies are required of all submittals, except for samples,
                                    which require only one set.

                                    There are three types of cost estimates: programming esti-
                                    mate, rough estimate, and final cost estimates. All projects
                                    are subject to approval limits and/or statutory limits.

                                    Programming estimates are those reflected on the pro-
                                    gramming documents (DD Form 1391 or AF Form 332).
                                    These are initial estimates based on historical cost data de-
                                    veloped early in the process to “get the ball rolling.”

                                    Rough estimates are those at the conceptual design stage.
                                    The prime purpose of these estimates is to determine an
                                    estimate closer to real costs using the additional informa-
                                    tion of the conceptual design. These are budget estimates
                                    based on parametric cost estimates generated by the Air
                                    Force Parametric Cost Estimating System (PACES) or
                                    similar software or based on historic cost data. Discrepan-
                                    cies between this estimate and the AF Form 332 or DD
                                    Form 1391 greater than 25 percent will require the work
                                    approval document to be revalidated by Base Development.
                                    The accuracy of this rough estimate is generally about ±20
                                    percent.

                                    The final cost estimate should be accomplished on the AF
                                    Form 3052, Construction Cost Estimate Breakdown, or an
                                    approved electronic equivalent and reflect material and la-
                                    bor estimates by specification divisions. Costs for con-
                                    tractor’s overhead and profit are included. Standard per-
                                    centages are 15 percent overhead and ten percent profit.
                                    The accuracy of this estimate should be about plus or minus
                                    ten percent. This estimate represents a professional as-

                                     sessment of the project costs. The AF Form 3052 should
                                     be signed and dated by the project designer. The AF Form
                                     3052 should be marked For Official Use Only (FOUO).

                                     Several factors beyond the control of the project designer
                                     can adversely affect the accuracy of cost estimates. Some
                                     of these are economic conditions, number of bidders, visi-
                                     bility of the project, and time of the year.

                                     A complete design analysis for all projects must be in-
                                     cluded in the project folder (the A-E can provide a more
                                     detailed description) including all calculations performed in
                                     the design of the project; i.e. square footage, heat loads, and
                                     structural design. The project designer must ensure all de-
                                     sign information is collected from the other engineering
                                     disciplines and included in the project file.

                                     Upon completion of first complete draft of drawings and
                                     specifications, the project is at the final design stage.

2.3.8   The Final Design             Once the drawings, specifications, and the AF Form 3052
        Review                       (final cost estimate) are completed, the engineer will pre-
                                     pare a final review package.

                                     The package should be sent to Base Contracting, Environ-
                                     mental Flight, Operations Flight, Fire Protection Flight,
                                     Bioenvironmental, Communications Program Management,
                                     Ground Safety, Security Forces, Corrosion Engineer, and
                                     the using agency. If the project designer requires a final
                                     design review meeting, the package is sent ten days prior to
                                     the scheduled time and place of the meeting.

                                     At the final design stage, there should be no design
                                     changes. If the design team did a good job keeping the
                                     user(s) involved, changes should be limited to clarifica-
                                     tions, misspelled words, and typos. Any other change will
                                     require written justification from the requester. Changes
                                     will be accepted only if it is a result of equipment or mis-
                                     sion changes and after approval of a work request (AF
                                     Form 332).

                                     If a final design review meeting is held, the final review
                                     comments should be incorporated on a working copy of
                                     specifications and drawings. A formal review meeting
                                     should be a methodical progression, section-by-section, of
                                     the project specifications or drawing, sheet-by-sheet, mak-

                                     design review meeting is a marked-up copy of specifica-
                                     tions and drawings showing all necessary changes required
                                     by each reviewer with their assurance that they will sign
                                     when changes are incorporated.

                                     The project designer should obtain the specifications, do a
                                     final review/update, and make arrangements to have them
                                     sent to reproduction. Drawings will be reproduced and as-
                                     sembled for delivery to base contracting. The engineer will
                                     prepare the standard cover letter and package to send to
                                     base contracting requesting advertisement. In preparation
                                     of the package, the project designer should know liquidated
                                     damages include, but are not necessarily limited to, the cost
                                     of inspection and any loss of revenue of the using agency
                                     which is caused by a construction delay. The construction
                                     time must be adequate. It should not be unusually com-
                                     pressed or lengthy and construction time should be adjusted
                                     to take into account statistical data on the weather.

2.3.10 Other Duties after            The project designer’s responsibility extends throughout the
       Design                        construction process to project completion.

                                     Potential bidders will have a chance to visit the project site
                                     prior to submitting bids. The project designer and/or the
                                     Contracting Officer will escort the prospective bidders and
                                     answer questions they may have. The outcome of the site
                                     visit may be the identification of some discrepancies in the
                                     project documents. If there are discrepancies, the project
                                     designer will be required to prepare an amendment to the
                                     project (See Section 2.5.3 of this AFPAM for guidance on
                                     amendments).

                                     The project designer should attend the bid opening on the
                                     project, and obtain a copy of the bid abstract from con-
                                     tracting. The project designer should then report the bid
                                     results to the Chief of Contracts on the day of the Bid
                                     Opening, and prepare a message requesting funds to award
                                     the project.

                                     Once a contractor has been selected and approved, a pre-
                                     construction conference is held to inform the contractor of
                                     what is required while operating on the base and to clarify
                                     any questions the contractor may have on the project
                                     documents.

                                     The progress schedule is the contractor’s estimate of the
                                     work schedule. The project designer is required to briefly
                                     review and initial it for adequacy. The Chief of Contracts
                                     approves the project progress schedule.

                                     The specifications of a project usually require the contrac-
                                     tor to submit samples, technical data, manufacturer’s in-
                                     struction, etc., for the project designer to evaluate in terms
                                     of compliance with the specifications. Using the AF Form
                                     3000, Material Approval Submittal, the project designer
                                     should evaluate the submittal, approve or disapprove (ex-
                                     plaining fully the reasons for disapproval), and should also
                                     signify any decisions made on color, size, etc. All submit-
                                     tals involving colors should be made at one time to ensure a
                                     coordinated color scheme. Color selections must meet the
                                     base architectural and compatibility standards. All submit-
                                     tals should be returned to the construction inspector/QAE
                                     assigned to the project within five days.
                                     .
                                     The project designer shall make a point to visit the project
                                     site at least once a week. There are valuable lessons that
                                     can be learned in viewing the transformations from draw-
                                     ings to reality. If the project designer notices a discrep-
                                     ancy, it should be brought to the attention of the construc-
                                     tion inspector/QAE and not be handled between the project
                                     designer and the contractor. Engineers and/or architects are
                                     not authorized to direct the contractor to make any changes.

                                     A modification is a formal change to the contract after it
                                     has been awarded. (Refer to Section 2.6.3 of this AFPAM
                                     for preparing a contract modification.) Changes on projects
                                     that were designed by an A-E require different treatment.
                                     (See Section 2.9 of this AFPAM for additional details on
                                     A-E Liability).

                                     repeated. Project mistakes should be a learning experience.
       Post-Occupancy
       Evaluations                   If an A-E was used to design a project, a post-design

2.3.12 Summary                       The project designer’s responsibility on a project far ex-
                                     ceeds design duties. Responsibility is throughout the proj-
                                     ect cycle from inception to completion. Proper discharge
                                     of this responsibility will yield a product of which an engi-
                                     neer or architect can be proud.

2.4     Design Reviews               The design team leader is responsible to the Chief of Con-
                                     tracts for managing the design review process on all as-
                                     signed projects. A systematic approach to conducting de-
                                     sign reviews must be established or available in operating
                                     instructions to ensure uniformity. MAJCOM guidance for
                                     design review of special or complex projects is generally
                                     available in MAJCOM and AFCESA issued Engineering
                                     Technical Letters (ETLs), or Construction Technical Let-
                                     ters (CTLs).

2.4.1    Design Review Types         All projects are reviewed by several functional agencies
         and Purposes                throughout the design process. During design reviews, all
                                     comments provided by functional agencies should be sub-
                                     mitted in writing.

                                     In the functional review by the using organization, the
                                     project designer guides the customer through the entire de-
                                     sign process to help the customer fully understand the
                                     drawings and specifications in relationship to their re-
                                     quirements. This ensures the customer knows what they
                                     are getting.

                                     During the contracting review, the project documents,
                                     complete with drawings and specifications, are reviewed by
                                     base contracting. When Contracting returns the project re-
                                     view comments, the appropriate comments are incorporated
                                     in the design package by the project designer. The project
                                     designer sends a reply to Contracting indicating the action
                                     taken on each comment. It is essential to the success of the
                                     entire design process that Engineering and Contracting
                                     work together to accomplish mutual goals.

                                     The Operations Flight review is to ensure the design
                                     drawings and specifications meet operability and maintain-

                                    maintenance. The review also ensures building system
                                    components are easily accessible for routine maintenance
                                    and replacement. Experienced facility maintenance per-
                                    sonnel ensure designs do not include specifications of a
                                    system that would be non-maintainable. One objective of
                                    the project design is to select systems, components, and
                                    arrangements which reduce future maintenance. Such fa-
                                    cility systems include exterior and interior finishes, win-
                                    dows, and roofs for buildings. Maintenance points and
                                    maintainable controls for mechanical systems and adequate
                                    shutoff points and looping for utilities distribution systems
                                    are considered. Stormwater drainage, adequate edge con-
                                    tainment techniques for pavements, and corrosion control
                                    for buried systems and components are reviewed.

                                    The Fire Protection Flight review ensures the drawings
                                    and specifications meet fire safety, life safety, and code
                                    compliance. They also ensure the design meets local fire
                                    fighting operational requirements (i.e., accessibility to fa-
                                    cility, location of fire hydrants, etc.).

                                    The Constructibility Review by the construction inspec-
                                    tor/QAE for the team assigned to the project ensures the
                                    contractors can determine, from the project specifications
                                    and drawings, exactly what the project designer wants built
                                    or repaired and how that repair or construction should take
                                    place. The goal of the review is to both reduce the likeli-
                                    hood of delays in bid openings or potential modifications
                                    during construction which cause wasted effort, higher con-
                                    struction costs, subsequent contractor claims, increased
                                    administrative effort, and delayed contract completion.

                                    The BCE review is made of the completed drawings and
                                    specifications after all previous reviews have been com-
                                    pleted and applicable review comments incorporated. The
                                    Base Civil Engineer conducts the review with the assis-
                                    tance of the Deputy Base Civil Engineer, Chief of the En-

                                     informs the project designer when this review is applicable.

                                                                  NOTE

                                       and Fire Protection Flight reviews could entail large
                                       scope changes if the project does not meet applicable
                                       criteria at the final design stage. The project designer
                                       must ensure that these inputs are received at the con-
                                       ceptual design stage review to keep the project on
                                       schedule and eliminate false starts.

                                     official correspondence to the appropriate reviewing of-
                                     fices. It is the project designer's responsibility to ensure the
                                     customer is notified when their project is available for re-
                                     view.

2.4.3     Design Review              The design process begins with a site visit and the pre-
          Stages                     design conference, scheduled and documented by the proj-
                                     ect designer. The project designer ensures all appropriate
                                     project approval documents (i.e., AF Form 332 or DD
                                     Form 1391) have been completed. The purpose of the pre-
                                     design conference is to ensure all requirements are identi-
                                     fied. It also initiates environmental actions including as-
                                     bestos/lead surveys, a review to determine any required
                                     permits, and the Environmental Impact Analysis Process, if
                                     required. Refer to paragraph 2.3.4 for detailed guidance on
                                     purpose and representations required to attend the pre-
                                     design conference. The design should be reviewed at the
                                     conceptual, intermediate (if applicable), and final design

                                    review is to provide all concerned parties the opportunity to
                                    review and comment on the design approach, and methods
                                    and proposed solutions to approved facility projects.

                                    It is essential for customers to participate early in the pro-
                                    gramming stage, become involved during concept devel-
                                    opment, and ensure all their requirements are included in
                                    the final concept design. This final concept design is the
                                    last chance for the customer to input user requirements, ex-
                                    cept for necessary mission changes. The project is consid-
                                    ered at the conceptual design stage once the final concept
                                    design is approved.

                                    The ultimate goal of concept design review is to avoid
                                    costly changes in the latter stages of design or during con-
                                    struction. A thorough functional review must be made to
                                    ensure all functional requirements are efficiently and effec-
                                    tively provided.

                                    The conceptual design review is not a forum for introduc-
                                    ing new work requirements or changing the scope of the
                                    project. Use Cost Control During Design measures to re-
                                    solve all scope and cost differences before proceeding with
                                    design. Take whatever measures are necessary to incorpo-
                                    rate all essential project requirements into the basic project
                                    design package; incorporate supplemental requirements or
                                    necessary scope reductions as bid options. If it becomes
                                    necessary to alter the project scope by plus or minus 25
                                    percent or increase the project cost by more than 25 per-
                                    cent, these new requirements must be processed and ap-
                                    proved by the appropriate authority before proceeding with
                                    project design. This usually requires a revision to the AF
                                    Form 332 or DD Form 1391 by the Base Development
                                    Element and possibly approved by a higher authority. Con-
                                    sult your Base Development Element for direction and
                                    guidance.

                                    The conceptual design review should always occur prior to
                                    detailing civil (structural), architectural, electrical, or me-
                                    chanical systems. However, the project designer must have
                                    thoroughly reviewed the work requirements (AF Form 332
                                    and DD Form 1391) and formulated design approaches,
                                    concepts or plans. The basic features, materials, systems,
                                    and related costs necessary to meet the financial require-
                                    ments of the project must be established. In advance of the
                                    design review, the project designer must prepare concept
                                    drawings or sketches (i.e., floor plans, elevations) and word

                                    descriptions defining and describing the major or signifi-
                                    cant elements of the project design. In addition, an outline
                                    of the specifications to be used, a preliminary cost estimate,
                                    and the basis of design (including design assumptions, pre-
                                    liminary calculations, life safety analysis, and energy con-
                                    servation inputs) shall be provided.

                                    At the conceptual design review, the environmental flight
                                    representative annotates whether any environmental per-
                                    mits are required. The environmental flight is responsible
                                    for ensuring applications for appropriate environmental
                                    permits are made and/or issued before the design reaches
                                    completion. Most permits are identified when the Certifi-
                                    cate of Compliance is prepared along with the DD Form
                                    1391. The project designer is responsible for ensuring the
                                    application for appropriate permits are made and/or issued
                                    before reaching design completion. The asbestos/lead sur-
                                    vey test results, required by the designer at the pre-design
                                    stage, are reviewed. If asbestos/lead has been discovered, it
                                    is handled in a method approved by the environmental
                                    flight. It is extremely important the project designer en-
                                    sures that this survey is completed and resolved prior to the
                                    intermediate design stage. Other areas of environmental
                                    concern also involve potential equipment that could pro-
                                    duce greenhouse gases, contain ozone depleting substances,
                                    or contain materials that could be recycled or recovered.

                                    The project designer is responsible for documenting min-
                                    utes of the design review meeting and having all attendees
                                    sign an attendance roster. The original meeting minutes,
                                    with all the design review documents, will be forwarded to
                                    the Chief of Contracts for review and then filed in the proj-
                                    ect folder. Copies of the minutes should be sent to all at-
                                    tendees to ensure their concurrence.

                                    The project designer notifies attendees of the conceptual
                                    design review and ensures the comments are received sev-
                                    eral days prior to the review meeting. The meeting should
                                    be used to answer open questions and to discuss and re-
                                    solve any other items which could present problems.

                                    All conceptual design reviews should be attended by the
                                    project designer, the customer single point of contact, the

                                     tive, and the Security Forces. Depending on the size of the
                                     project, it may be appropriate for others to attend. The
                                     project designer will determine if the Base Contracting rep-
                                     resentative, Community Planner, and Energy Officer
                                     should be invited.

                                     If the project requires MAJCOM technical review, a deter-
                                     mination made by the Chief of Contracts, the project
                                     documentation will be forwarded to Command. The pack-
                                     ages for command technical review should be prepared in
                                     accordance with MAJCOM instructions. A copy of the DD
                                     Form 1391 drawings, specifications, design analysis, bid
                                     schedule, performance schedule, and other supporting
                                     documentation should be forwarded.

                                     If the review process is conducted properly, last minute de-
                                     sign changes should be unnecessary and costly redesign
                                     efforts will be avoided.

2.4.3.2   Intermediate               At the intermediate design stage, the representatives from
          Design Stage               all the organizations who sign the drawing cover sheets at
                                     the final design stage and Contracting receive copies of the
                                     submittal for review. The choice of whether to include an
                                     intermediate design review should be based on the project
                                     requirement and the user. For example, a project that is
                                     entirely electrical or mechanical in nature probably doesn’t
                                     require an intermediate design review, due to the speciali-
                                     zation of work involved. An architectural project that in-
                                     cludes exterior/interior finishes, layouts, etc. almost always
                                     requires an intermediate design review.

2.4.3.3   Final Design Stage         When the drawings and specifications are complete, a gov-
                                     ernment cost estimate is prepared (AF Form 3052 or
                                     equivalent), and the project designer prepares a final review
                                     package. This package is then distributed to each organiza-
                                     tion that is required to sign the cover sheet for their review.

                                     At the final design stage, there should be no design
                                     changes. Changes should be limited to clarifications, mis-
                                     spelled words, and typos, if any. Any other change re-
                                     quires written justification from the requester. Changes
                                     will be accepted only if it is a result of equipment or mis-
                                     sion changes and after approval of a work request (AF
                                     Form 332).

                                     The result of a final review meeting will be a marked-up

                                     changes required by each reviewer with their assurance that
                                     they will sign the 100 percent project design drawings
                                     when changes are incorporated.

2.4.4    Signatures                  After incorporating the agreed upon final review com-
                                     ments, the team engineering assistant ensures the drawings
                                     are signed by all of the reviewing agencies. The Chief of
                                     Contracts ensures the PCMS/PM reflects the final design
                                     status. If this is a MILCON or P341 project, CWE funds
                                     required must not exceed the 125 percent of the pro-
                                     grammed amount (PA) shown on the DD Form 1391. If
                                     the CWE exceeds 125 percent of the PA for projects in
                                     those funding categories, reduce the design requirements or
                                     reprogram the project. For other projects, the funds re-
                                     quired should be within 25 percent of figures on the DD
                                     Form 1391 or AF Form 332. If not, the approval document
                                     must be revalidated with Base Development. The project
                                     designer/manager is responsible for initiating action to en-
                                     sure agreement of the figures. Once the drawings and speci-
                                     fication are signed, the project is considered to be 98 per-
                                     cent designed. Once the contract package is completed, it
                                     is considered 100 percent and ready to advertise.

2.5     Processing Funded            Processing of the completed 100 percent design package to
        Projects                     contracting should be expedited upon notification the proj-
                                     ect has received funding authority or funds. Uniform pro-
                                     cedures must be established to ensure contracting actions
                                     can be executed in a timely fashion.

2.5.1    Typical Procedures          Once the project has been approved and funding author-
                                     ized, a project synopsis should be immediately forwarded
                                     to Contracting. Contracting will then determine the best
                                     avenue for awarding the contract.

                                     The appropriate funding documents (usually an AF Form 9,
                                     Request For Purchase or equivalent) are then prepared and
                                     submitted to the Chief of Contracts for concurrence and the
                                     Chief of the Engineering Flight for signature. Many in-
                                     stallations use the Automated Business Service System
                                     (ABSS) to complete and route these documents electroni-
                                     cally. Upon approval, the funding documents are then for-
                                     warded to the Civil Engineering Resources Flight for proc-
                                     essing. If the requirement is time sensitive, Resources
                                     should be notified that the funding documents will be
                                     quickly processed through the system. One set of the plans
                                     and specifications, along with the certified funding docu-

                                     ments, should be delivered to Contracting within ten days
                                     of receipt of funding authorization.

                                     Contracting then schedules the bid opening date and the
                                     Chief of Contracts is notified. The information is entered
                                     into the PCMS/PM database. Any delays in the scheduled
                                     bid opening should be immediately brought to the attention
                                     of the Chief of Contracts.

2.5.2     Contracting                Many contracting methods are available to award a project.
          Alternatives               Contracting will need to evaluate the size of the project, the
                                     complexity of the work involved, and the estimated cost to
                                     determine which method to use for award.

2.5.2.1    Invitation for Bid        The method used most frequently is the Invitation for Bid
           (IFB)                     (IFB) process. This method invites all bidders to submit
                                     their lump sum cost to complete the work identified in the
                                     project drawings and specifications. This cost is based on
                                     the contractor’s interpretation of the drawings and specifi-
                                     cations. Government technical evaluations are not per-
                                     formed under the IFB method. At the bid opening, con-
                                     tracting will officially open the bids and announce the con-
                                     tractor submitting the lowest cost. Contracting then deter-
                                     mines if the contractor has the manpower and resources to
                                     accomplish the work before awarding the contract to the
                                     lowest bidder.

2.5.2.2    Request for               Another method gaining popularity over the IFB is the Re-
           Proposal (RFP)            quest for Proposal (RFP) process. This method invites all
                                     technically competent bidders (or selective bidders) to
                                     submit their itemized breakout costs for completing the
                                     work identified in the project drawings and specifications.
                                     When proposals are received, contracting informs the Con-
                                     tracts Element of the results and one of two approaches can
                                     be taken to provide the best value for the government:

                                     Tradeoff process. This process allows the government to
                                     consider award to "other than the lowest priced offeror" or
                                     "other than the highest technically rated offeror."

                                     Lowest price technically acceptable source selection
                                     process. This process allows the government to consider
                                     award to the offeror that has the lowest price after being
                                     evaluated as technically acceptable.

                                     Consult with your local contracting office for details on
                                     these RFP processes.

2.5.3   Amendments                   An amendment is a change to the project prior to contract
                                     award. Amendments to drawings and specifications occur
                                     whenever a project has been solicited by contracting and
                                     questions or clarifications arise. It is the project designer’s
                                     responsibility to ensure all requests for information re-
                                     ceived by Contracting are addressed quickly to prevent a
                                     delay in the award process.

                                     Once a question is received, the project designer should
                                     examine the project specifications and drawings to deter-
                                     mine the validity of the concern. If an error in the contract
                                     documents is evident and must be corrected, the project de-
                                     signer must prepare an amendment. If no design error ex-
                                     ists and sufficient data has been furnished in the contract
                                     specifications and drawings, reply correspondence should
                                     be sent to Contracting explaining only a clarification is re-
                                     quired and the clarification will be provided to the appro-
                                     priate contractor.

                                     If an amendment is required involving a cost increase, ad-
                                     ditional funding authority must be requested. If the project
                                     was locally funded, the request is coordinated with the CE
                                     Resources Flight. If it is a Command-funded project, a
                                     letter or message must be sent to the Command explaining
                                     why additional authority is needed. The amendment cannot
                                     be processed until the additional authority is received.

                                     Once authority has been received or if no authority was re-
                                     quired, the amendment is prepared using a standard format
                                     with a list of attachments tailored to the specific situation.
                                     Upon receipt of this information, Contracting prepares a
                                     Standard Form 30, Amendment of Solicitation
                                     /Modification of Contract, addressing the query and ex-
                                     tends the due date for offers.

                                     It is important to process contractor questions in a timely
                                     manner, ensuring project award process is not delayed. An
                                     amendment must reach Contracting at least ten days prior
                                     to the scheduled bid opening or the bid opening date will be
                                     extended.

2.5.4   Bid Opening                  At the bid opening, the project designer should obtain the
                                     SF Form 1419, Abstract of Offers – Construction, from
                                     Contracting. The project designer then furnishes the bid
                                     results to the Chief of Contracts so the information can be
                                     forwarded to the Engineering Flight Chief, and the BCE.
 Working in the Engineering Flight                                                                41

                                     The Chief of Contracts will ensure the bid results are accu-
                                     rately posted in the PCMS/PM database.

                                     Contracting will request a technical bid evaluation via letter
                                     or two-way memo. If the project is an Invitation for Bid
                                     (IFB), and the low bid is within 15 percent of the Inde-
                                     pendent Government Estimate (IGE), the usual response is
                                     the bid appears to be valid. If the low bid is more than 15
                                     percent below the IGE, an explanation of whether the con-
                                     tractor has included the entire scope must be provided. If
                                     the low bid is 15 percent higher than the IGE, the project
                                     designer must provide justification to Contracting with re-
                                     gard to the technical accuracy of the low bid versus the
                                     IGE. If the low bid cannot be substantiated, the solicitation
                                     will be canceled. A decision will then be made if the proj-
                                     ect will be rescoped and resolicited.

2.5.5    Bid Evaluation              Upon receipt of the project designer’s technical bid evalua-
                                     tion, Contracting incorporates the response with their con-
                                     tracting validation results and determines if the low bid is
                                     valid. Upon validation, if the low bid was 15 percent
                                     higher than the IGE, a standard excessive bids e-mail form
                                     must be completed and provided to the Chief of Contracts
                                     for submission through the BCE to Command for request-
                                     ing funds. The project designer should inform the Chief of
                                     Contracts and ensure the PCMS/PM database is updated
                                     with the bid validation date. If the project is MILCON or
                                     P-341, refer to section 2.8 of this AFPAM for additional
                                     information.

2.5.6    Project Funding             Command will fund most projects based on PCMS/PM data
                                     and send project money in the amount of the acceptable
                                     low bid to the base via funding channels. Some projects
                                     may also be funded locally by tenant units or other agen-
                                     cies. Resources will then process any funding documents
                                     to award or coordinate funding actions for locally-funded
                                     projects.

2.6     Construction                 Construction inspectors or QAEs in the Contracts Element
        Management                   are responsible for construction management of assigned
                                     contracts providing surveillance, conducting inspections,
                                     and ensuring quality performance. The main responsibility
                                     of construction management personnel is to ensure the gov-
                                     ernment receives quality and complete work as outlined in
                                     government or A-E produced contract documents (i.e.,
                                     specifications and project drawings). This is accomplished
                                     through management procedures and policies that extend

                                                                                      Chapter 2

                                    from design through construction completion (cradle-to-
                                    grave). Policies must be established to facilitate quality
                                    construction and to monitor effectiveness of management
                                    techniques. All construction inspectors or QAEs must be
                                    familiar with all appropriate regulations, manuals, Con-
                                    struction Technical Letters (CTL’s), and internal operating
                                    instructions pertaining to the Contracts Element. They
                                    conduct constructibility reviews of assigned projects prior
                                    to solicitation and coordinate all facility work with affected
                                    base organizations to minimize mission impact or to de-
                                    velop alternate operating procedures. They inspect con-
                                    struction sites at least once a day during routine work and
                                    during all phases of critical construction. Inspections will,
                                    at a minimum, address the following issues: construction
                                    and personnel safety, site cleanliness and control of debris
                                    and materials, communication with contractor superinten-
                                    dent, resolution of potential conflicts between users and
                                    base organizations, and monitoring the progress of con-
                                    struction.

                                    The construction inspector/QAE maintains a contract folder
                                    to consolidate all contract information prior to and during
                                    construction. The inspector/QAE controls contract cost and
                                    performance growth rate through experienced foresight,
                                    attention to potential problems, and timely correction or
                                    contract modifications to ensure uninterrupted contract per-
                                    formance. The inspector/QAE looks for ways to reduce
                                    contract cost and/or performance period by deviations in
                                    contract specifications that would still satisfy the require-
                                    ments of the project (i.e., value engineering concepts).

                                    Modifications due to unforeseen site conditions should be
                                    executed as quickly as possible to prevent delays. Modifi-
                                    cations due to design deficiencies should be identified and
                                    corrected as soon as possible to prevent increased cost due
                                    to removing deficient construction or expensive alterations
                                    to accommodate design. Modifications due to user change
                                    should be discouraged unless the facility under construction
                                    would not be usable without the requested change. When it
                                    becomes necessary to initiate a modification, the team
                                    leader and the Contracting Officer are notified immediately
                                    and the inspector should follow procedures identified in
                                    section 2.6.3.1 of this AFPAM.

                                    Pre-final and final inspections are coordinated and con-
                                    ducted to include all parties having an interest in the com-
                                    pleted project. Once construction is completed and ac-

                                     cepted by the government, close-out procedures are initi-
                                     ated, including filing of all guarantee/warranty information.

                                     Surveillance of completed projects is maintained to identify
                                     any latent defects or poor construction methods that might
                                     be apparent only after completion of construction.

2.6.1     Procedures                 The following procedures cover the more significant ac-
                                     tions required of the construction inspector/QAE in the
                                     management of contracted projects.

2.6.1.1    Constructibility          The purpose of the constructibility review is to improve
           Reviews                   construction contract performance by identifying errors and
                                     omissions in the drawings, specifications, and bidding
                                     documents. The contract inspector reviewers should con-
                                     centrate on methods of construction, using the knowledge
                                     they have acquired from site and contractor visits to advise
                                     engineering of local methods and conditions that might de-
                                     viate from specifications. Mistakes in the drawings and
                                     specifications often lead to wasted effort, requiring contract
                                     modifications, higher construction costs, contractor claims,
                                     and delayed contract completion. The construction in-
                                     spector/QAE should perform the constructibility review
                                     along with the team leader and address the site conditions
                                     and restrictions; labor availability and skills; local material
                                     availability; local construction techniques; construction
                                     phasing requirements, including weather; demolition; long
                                     lead time for construction or equipment items; and special
                                     construction requirements (i.e., utility outages, street clo-
                                     sures, etc.).

                                     Various MAJCOMs have developed standardized con-
                                     structibility review checklists similar to the HQ AETC
                                     checklist (see Attachment 2, Constructibility Checklist).
                                     When an item-by-item review is necessary, the reviewer
                                     marks the appropriate column on the checklist. The project
                                     designer coordinates the review comments and makes the
                                     necessary changes deemed appropriate. The original
                                     checklist and any other constructibility comments are filed
                                     in the project folder.

2.6.1.2    Project                   The construction inspector/QAE ensures that all necessary
           Documentation             contractual documents are assembled and placed in the
                                     project folder at contract award. All of the items shown in
                                     the project folder checklist form the official project folder
                                     documentation. If any item in the folder is missing, the

                                     team leader will take actions required to secure the missing
                                     items.

                                     The following contract records must also be included in the

2.6.1.3   Contract Start             As soon as a project is awarded, the construction inspec-
                                     tor/QAE assigned to that project will begin recording the
                                     construction progress data in PCMS/PM. When the pre-
                                     performance notice (also known as the pre-construction
                                     conference) is received, the team leader is invited to attend.
                                     Prior to the pre-construction meeting, the using agency is
                                     contacted to inspect the job site. Any problem areas or ex-
                                     isting damage which is not part of the contract should be
                                     noted. Any phasing on the project that will affect the user’s
                                     operation through moves, inconveniences, location of stor-
                                     age sites, etc., should be discussed. A memorandum for
                                     record stating any problems or damage noted is prepared.

                                     Formal minutes from the pre-performance conference will
                                     be prepared by Base Contracting, with a copy forwarded to
                                     the construction inspector/QAE for inclusion in the folder.

                                     Before commencing with construction, the contractor will
                                     set-up the construction site in accordance with the con-
                                     tract’s construction site standards and notify the construc-
                                     tion inspector/QAE of conditions not consistent with the
                                     contract.

2.6.2     Contract Inspection        The contract inspection documents include the AF Form
          Records                    1477, Construction Inspection Record; AF Form 3064
                                     Contract Progress Schedule; and the AF Form 3065, Con-
                                     tract Progress Report. These documents are an integral part
                                     of the contract execution and surveillance process. They
                                     constitute the legal record of the government position and
                                     version of contract events. They are used extensively as
                                     evidence in the negotiation and settlement of contractor
                                     claims and disputes. Utmost care must be taken to ensure
                                     these documents are correctly maintained and completely
                                     accurate.

                                     All projects with a performance period over 59 days require
                                     an AF Form 3064 and AF Form 3065. An AF Form 1477
                                     is also prepared for each day of the contract for projects
                                     with performance periods that exceed 59 days.

2.6.2.1    AF Form 1477              AF Form 1477, Construction Inspection Record, is the
                                     Inspector’s diary, a log of the construction events on each
                                     project. It is an essential part of management and should
                                     provide an accurate story of the details of any project.
                                     Hence, the entries must be complete and accurate. At
                                     times, this diary, alone, can substantiate or disallow a con-
                                     tractor’s claim if events are recorded promptly and prop-
                                     erly. Disputes with the contractor, in many cases, are set-
                                     tled by the fact that requests of the contractor were re-
                                     corded in the diary. The inspector will enter all data and
                                     information listed in the appropriate blocks of the AF Form
                                     1477. All entries should be legibly entered in ink, made for
                                     each day of the week. In the event the contractor chooses
                                     not to work on Saturday, Sunday, or holidays, include the
                                     weather data and the notation “No Work Accomplished.”
                                     For each day the contractor works, a daily inspection record
                                     is completed and the following elements included in the
                                     diary entries. Most of the information entered in the AF
                                     Form 1477 should be discussed and verified with the con-
                                     tractor to avoid any miscommunication or misinterpretation
                                     of events.
                                     Diary entries include:
                                     (1)     A description of actual work accomplished.

                                            Include contractors’ efforts to rectify them.
                                     (4)    Instructions and interpretations of contract docu-

                                            delays.

                                     (8)    The use of photography as a means of documenta-
                                            tion is highly encouraged. Pictures should be used
                                            to substantiate records of work accomplished, un-
                                            safe conditions, and work rejected. Photos should
                                            be stapled on each page with the date, time, subject,
                                            and signature. Photos are hard to refute and can be
                                            extremely valuable in contractor negotiations.

                                     At the conclusion of a project, the construction inspec-
                                     tor/QAE will make sure the AF Form 1477 is complete and
                                     reviewed by the Chief of the Section. The daily diaries are
                                     formally transmitted to the Contracting Officer for inclu-
                                     sion in their files. After one year, the project folder can be
                                     retired and sent to staging in accordance with current ad-
                                     ministrative procedures.

2.6.2.2   AF Form 3064               AF Form 3064, Contract Progress Schedule, is submitted
                                     to base contracting office within five days after the com-
                                     mencement of work or another period of time, as deter-
                                     mined by the Contracting Officer. This form is prepared by
                                     the contractor and shows the order in which the contractor
                                     proposes to do the work. It also includes an area for dates
                                     on which the contractor contemplates starting and com-
                                     pleting the several salient features of the work (including
                                     acquiring materials, equipment, etc.) The contractor will
                                     break down the phases into percentages of the total work
                                     complete, which will also serve as a proposal for payment.

                                     Upon submission of the initial AF Form 3064, the Con-
                                     tracting Officer will evaluate the percentage of the total job

                                     assigned to each work element. The following factors
                                     should be considered by the inspector when evaluating the
                                     feasibility of the contractor’s proposal.

                                     Particular attention should be paid to those elements per-
                                     formed in the early stages of the effort to preclude an over-
                                     statement that would result in an imbalance in payments for
                                     work performed (known as front loading).

                                     For projects where much of the total project price is de-
                                     voted to material acquisition, the contractor should separate
                                     the cost of materials from the installation and execution of
                                     the work. This process will guarantee the contractor is
                                     reimbursed for extensive front-end costs, while the gov-
                                     ernment will be able to better gauge the overall execution
                                     of work.

                                     The schedule should be in a logical progression of events
                                     and should not be designed to leave a large part of the criti-
                                     cal elements of construction for the latter part of the per-
                                     formance period. Doing so may make it easier for the con-
                                     tractor to receive extensions without government compen-
                                     sation. Proposals for payment should be evenly spaced to
                                     avoid paying large amounts of the contract cost at one time.

                                     The time period on the AF Form 3064 should match the
                                     contract performance period and the form should be accu-
                                     rately completed and signed by the contractor.

                                     After all factors have been considered, the government will
                                     ask for clarifications and/or changes from the contractor, if
                                     needed. The construction inspector/QAE will recommend
                                     approval to the Contracting Officer. The inspector should
                                     then file the approved AF Form 3064 in the project folder.
                                     Any significant modifications to the performance period
                                     should include a revised AF Form 3064. Contracting
                                     should also ask for a revised AF Form 3064 any time the
                                     contractor falls behind schedule with proper justification,
                                     such as hurricane or a truck strike delaying equipment de-
                                     livery. The inspector should use the AF Form 3064 as a
                                     tool to coordinate contract work with base organizations
                                     ahead of time. By knowing the periods of critical phases of
                                     construction, they can anticipate potential conflicts and
                                     work to alleviate them without contract delays.

                                     pose of receiving compensation for work completed. The
                                     form lists all elements of construction, as itemized on AF
                                     Form 3064. The percentage of the total job assigned to that
                                     element will be listed next to each element.

                                     The contractor and inspector will calculate the percentage
                                     of each element completed during a specific time period
                                     (weekly, in most cases) and, then, the cumulative percent-
                                     age of the element completed to date. The inspector will
                                     concur or non-concur on the 3065. At the Contracting Of-
                                     ficer’s discretion and according to the payments clause of
                                     the contract, this information will be used for computing
                                     progress payments.

2.6.3     Contract                   A modification is a formal change to a contract after it has
          Modifications              been awarded. Modifications must be limited to those cir-
                                     cumstances that: (1) would render the facility unusable
                                     from a functional standpoint or (2) are required due to ma-
                                     jor mission change rendering the original design inade-
                                     quate.

                                     Modification of contracts should only be considered if there
                                     is differing/changed site conditions, serious/major errors/
                                     omissions in design, mission changes, and/or safety/fire
                                     deficiencies. Before actions are taken to initiate a modifi-
                                     cation, the Contracting Officer should be notified of the
                                     problem. Project cost limitations and legal statutory limits
                                     should also be reviewed to make sure these limits are not
                                     exceeded.

                                     If the change is user-requested, the user will submit an AF
                                     Form 332, BCE Work Request, for approval for the addi-
                                     tional work prior to the change being executed. The project
                                     construction inspector/QAE will advise the project designer
                                     that a modification is required.

2.6.3.1    Modification              When it becomes known that a modification is required, the
           Procedures                inspector, QAE, or project manager should first consult
                                     base development and determine if the change is within the
                                     scope of the programming documents and that no statutory
                                     limits will be exceeded. If no programming issues are en-
                                     countered, an independent government estimate should be
                                     prepared if the modification involves a cost increase or de-
                                     crease. If the change is not complex, this may be com-
                                     pleted by the construction inspector/QAE. If it is beyond

                                    the capability of the construction inspector/QAE, it will be
                                    handled by the project designer.

                                    Technical approval must then be obtained for the modifica-
                                    tion. The BCE or Deputy BCE may have local approval
                                    authority for modifications under $50,000. Commands
                                    may provide approval authority for changes above $50,000
                                    (Consult your MAJCOM for details). The letter format for
                                    command technical approval (and funding authorization
                                    request, if required) can be used. Each modification will be
                                    classified in the technical approval document as an unfore-
                                    seen site condition, a design deficiency, a mission change,
                                    or a customer change.

                                    Once technical approval has been received and an increase
                                    in construction costs is involved, funding authority or funds
                                    must be obtained to negotiate the modification with the
                                    contractor. The construction inspector/QAE will first
                                    check with the Resources Flight to establish if funds are
                                    available locally. Modification less than $5,000, should be
                                    funded locally. If funds are not available locally, the con-
                                    struction inspector/QAE will prepare a letter to the
                                    MAJCOM requesting funding authority. If prior year funds
                                    apply, an Upward Obligation Letter (UOL) will be re-
                                    quired. Approval for a UOL may take up to 14 days. Once
                                    the UOL has been processed and approved, the actual
                                    money is usually in hand. Current year funded projects
                                    usually only receive authority initially. For current year
                                    funds, the request for authority is included in the technical
                                    approval letter for modifications over $50,000. If local
                                    funds are available, this reference would be deleted from
                                    the letter. For modifications under $50,000, MAJCOM
                                    concurrence for current year funded projects must be re-
                                    quested.

                                    Once funding authority or funds have been received for the
                                    modification, the modification package is prepared and the
                                    appropriate funding documents processed. If the change is
                                    within the construction inspector’s or QAE’s technical
                                    abilities, the representative will prepare the entire package
                                    from start to finish. Upon completion of the modification
                                    package, the construction inspector/QAE will then have the
                                    project designer review the modification package for com-
                                    pleteness and accuracy. The project designer signs the AF
                                    Form 3052, Construction Cost Estimate Breakdown, and
                                    ensures it is stamped “For Official Use Only.”

                                     If the required change is beyond the technical abilities of
                                     the construction inspector/QAE, the representative will
                                     work with the project designer to develop the required
                                     changes in a timely manner. The project designer will de-
                                     velop a description of the changes, the AF Form 3052, re-
                                     vised drawings and specifications, if necessary, and the
                                     modification. The construction inspector/QAE, upon re-
                                     ceipt of this information will complete the modification
                                     package and process it through the system. The modifica-
                                     tion package should include:
                                     (1)      the cover letter to Contracting;
                                     (2)      the modification;
                                     (3)      the appropriate funding documents, if required;
                                     (4)      the AF Form 3052, Construction Cost Estimate
                                              Breakdown, if required;
                                     (5)      the revised drawings and specifications, if required.

                                     When the modification package is completely assembled
                                     and approved, it is forwarded to the Contracting Officer for
                                     continuation of actions. After Contracting receives the
                                     complete modification package and the certified funding
                                     documents, they forward the modification to the contractor
                                     and, if required, a negotiation will be scheduled.

                                     If the project is through prior year funding, after the modi-
                                     fication has been negotiated, the modification will usually
                                     be awarded if the negotiated amount is less than the gov-
                                     ernment estimate. This is due to actually having funds for
                                     the modification. If the negotiated amount is higher than
                                     the government estimate, another UOL must be completed
                                     to obtain the additional approval and funds.

                                     For current year dollars, a letter must be sent to command
                                     Resources requesting the funds to award after negotiations
                                     are complete, regardless of whether the final amount is
                                     above or below the government estimate. This is due to
                                     having only authority, not actual dollars for the modifica-
                                     tion.

2.6.3.2   Contract                   Often during the course of a construction contract, the con-
          Deviations                 tractor will request or suggest a change to the plans or
                                     specifications. Depending upon the scope and potential for
                                     equitable adjustment, there are various methods for satis-
                                     fying the request.

                                     In some instances, it may be allowed as a “field change.”

                                    seen job conditions, user requests, or design oversights,
                                    clearly resulting in an equal or better product at no cost or
                                    time extension to the government. Some examples of field
                                    changes would be a change in location of a light switch or
                                    receptacle to suit the using agency or to make a room more
                                    functional. Change in material to a grade better for avail-
                                    ability reasons or the change in grade of sewer or water line
                                    to clear utilities are minor field changes.

                                    Changes resulting in a change in contract cost require a
                                    modification to the contract. These change orders should
                                    be limited to those circumstances that would render the fa-

                                    tions. The inspector annotates the change on the plans and
                                    verifies the change is included in the submission of the fi-
                                    nal as-builts. The reason for the change and the contrac-

                                    field change memorandum describing the change is signed
                                    by the job superintendent, project inspector, project engi-
                                    neer, and forwarded to the Contracting Officer for final ap-

                                    without sacrificing essential functions or requirements,
                                    waste or inefficiency that might increase acquisition, oper-
                                    ating or support costs. (Reference FAR Part 48 and FAR
                                    Clause 5248-1). Upon receipt, contracting, with the help of
                                    the Contracts Element, should promptly process and objec-

                                    should be ready to answer the following questions:
                                    (1)      Does the change impair essential functions or char-

                                     (2)    Does the change substantially reduce overall collat-
                                            eral costs, taking into account maintenance and life
                                            cycle costs?
                                     (3)    Does the change require a formal modification to
                                            the contract?
                                     (4)    Is the time needed to evaluate and implement the
                                            change worth the potential delay in contract prog-
                                            ress?
                                     (5)    Is the cost estimate provided by the contractor accu-
                                            rate and fair?
                                     (6)    Will the change require any additional testing or
                                            increased services and to what degree?
                                     (7)    Are the contractor’s proposed specifications, con-
                                            tract documents, and performance requirements ac-
                                            curate?

                                     If there is a negative answer to any of these considerations,
                                     a complete explanation of the reasons should be forwarded
                                     immediately to Contracting to ensure a prompt response
                                     within 45 days. If all questions are positive, a government
                                     cost estimate should be prepared and forwarded to the
                                     Contracting Officer.

2.6.4     Project Close-out          Close-out of a project should be completed no later than ten
          Procedures                 days after final acceptance. This enables the sections to
                                     close out a file which will be complete and accurate so fu-
                                     ture users will find it of value to the Air Force. These rec-
                                     ords will remain within the section for a minimum of one
                                     year after completion and then be forwarded to the docu-
                                     ment staging area on base.

2.6.4.1    Inspections               The pre-final inspection is usually performed when there
                                     are only a few items to be completed and there is time be-
                                     fore the final completion date to allow time to complete all
                                     items.

                                     The project inspector and the contractor will thoroughly
                                     inspect the job for all remaining items to be completed.
                                     This inspection is conducted at the contractor’s request.
                                     All incomplete items of work should be entered on a stan-
                                     dardized base developed “Report of Inspection” form. A
                                     copy of this pre-final inspection form is then provided to
                                     the contractor, Base Contracting, and filed in the project
                                     folder.

                                     The project inspector should request that the design engi-
                                     neers be present at all pre-final inspections to aid in in-

                                     specting technical aspects of the project, such as fire, elec-
                                     trical, and mechanical systems.

                                     The Facility Maintenance Element review and the pre-final
                                     inspections can be combined at the project inspector’s dis-
                                     cretion.

                                     The operations and maintenance check (O&M) will be
                                     conducted prior to the final inspection. This review pro-
                                     vides the opportunity for the users, Fire Protection Flight,
                                     and maintenance personnel to become familiar with newly-
                                     installed equipment and/or systems. A functional demon-
                                     stration training class, if required by the contract, will be
                                     conducted at this review. If obvious discrepancies are
                                     identified at this review, they shall be given in writing to
                                     the project inspector who will validate the discrepancies.

                                     The contractor will request a final inspection when all, or
                                     nearly all, items noted on the pre-final inspection report
                                     have been completed. The inspector will formally notify
                                     and invite all appropriate base agencies to attend the final
                                     inspection. At a minimum, the inspection group should
                                     include the contract manager, team leader, using agency,
                                     contracting officer, and the contractor. An orderly tour of
                                     the project should be made. The inspector records all valid
                                     discrepancies identified during this walk-through on the
                                     inspection report form.

2.6.4.2   Closing Actions            Upon satisfactory correction of all discrepancies noted on
                                     the final inspection, the inspector formally closes out the
                                     project.

                                     All warranty information is placed in the PCMS/PM data-
                                     base. Two copies of the warranty information file are
                                     printed. One copy is in a project file and the other copy
                                     attached to the front of the project folder. The construction
                                     inspector/QAE will fill in the warranty log.

                                     The completed Real Estate Construction Data Sheet is for-
                                     warded to Real Estate (one copy) and one copy maintained
                                     in the project file. (The copy in the folder should indicate
                                     the date forwarded to Real Estate and include the inspectors
                                     initials.)

                                     The AF Form 327, Base Civil Engineering Work Orders, is
                                     completed, ensuring the final cost and completion date is

                                     As-built drawings are sent to Maintenance Engineering for
                                     updating of Record Drawings. Keys are given to Real Es-
                                     tate and O&M facility manuals to Facility Maintenance.
                                     Maintain a copy of all hand receipts in the project file.

                                     Ensure all required copies of Operation and Maintenance
                                     manuals for installed equipment and systems have been re-
                                     ceived and copies sent to Facility Maintenance.

                                     AF Form 1477, Construction Inspection Records, and AF
                                     Form 3065, Contract Progress Reports, are sent with a
                                     transmittal letter to Base Contracting. The letter stating the
                                     logs/form was received is filed in the folder.

                                     If applicable, complete DD Form 2626, Performance
                                     Evaluation (Construction), and submit it to the Army Corps
                                     of Engineers to include in the Construction Contractor Ap-

                                     this AFPAM for details on CCASS).

                                     Finally, a white tab is attached to the front of folder and the
                                     completion date is posted. The folder is then forwarded to
                                     the element chief for review and signature.

                                                                NOTE
                                       On all construction projects involving asbestos, the
                                       following statement must be posted on the front of the
                                       project folder. “Asbestos Involved. This folder must

2.6.5   Warranty/Guarantee           The Air Force spends a large portion of its budget on items
        Procedures                   covered by warranty or guarantee. When the warranty and
                                     guarantee provisions are not enforced, the Air Force wastes
                                     funds. To avoid this loss, the Base Civil Engineer estab-
                                     lishes a program to choose items with warranties or guar-
                                     antees that are practical to enforce. The BCE maintains
                                     records on these items, and identifies the items to prevent
                                     workers from voiding the warranties or guarantees.

                                     The lead construction inspector/QAE manages the warranty
                                     and guarantee program. The inspector is responsible for
                                     making an evaluation of each warranty or guarantee. The
                                     construction inspector/QAE is also responsible for provid-

                                     When a project involves an existing facility and equipment
                                     is to be removed or replaced, Facility Maintenance should
                                     be contacted to determine if the equipment is in the Recur-
                                     ring Maintenance Program (RMP) inventory. If it is in the
                                     inventory, Facility Maintenance should be advised to re-
                                     move the item. Facility Maintenance needs the contract
                                     work order number, project number, and the date the
                                     equipment will be removed.

                                     Warranty/guarantee information is entered into the
                                     PCMS/PM computer. The type of information to be in-
                                     cluded in the warranty file is size, capacity, location of
                                     equipment within the facility, serial number, if new equip-
                                     ment is installed with existing equipment, and any specific
                                     remarks that will help determine if an item is under war-
                                     ranty.

                                     Once the information is input into the PCMS/PM computer,
                                     two copies are printed for the Warranty/Guarantee Log and
                                     the project folder.

                                     All original warranty or guarantee documents are attached
                                     to the file copy of the PCMS/PM report and a copy of the
                                     documents is attached to the log copy of the PCMS/PM re-
                                     port.

2.6.5.1   Warranty Repairs           When an item is to be repaired or replaced under the war-
                                     ranty/guarantee, the Facility Maintenance chief will notify
                                     the inspector or team leader. Notification is done with a
                                     job order issued from the service call desk with a worksheet
                                     attached detailing the problem. This job order and work-
                                     sheet is sent to the Facility Maintenance through the con-
                                     trollers. Facility Maintenance will thoroughly check the
                                     service call to determine, exactly, what has failed or needs
                                     repair. Once this has been done and it is determined to be a
                                     warranty item, Facility Maintenance will complete a war-
                                     ranty worksheet providing a detailed description of the
                                     problem, the date the problem was identified, the specific
                                     location of the item, any corrective action taken, and the
                                     shop personnel to contact when the contractor arrives on
                                     the job site. The Facility Maintenance chief signs the
                                     worksheet and forwards it to the Contracts Element for ac-

                                    struction inspector/QAE for review.

                                    Facility Maintenance is required to perform all mainte-
                                    nance on new equipment, even if it is under warranty.
                                    Failure to do so could void the warranty.

                                    Under emergency conditions, the BCE, the Chief of Con-
                                    tracts Element, or the contracting officer can authorize Fa-
                                    cility Maintenance personnel to repair or replace any de-
                                    fective items without forfeiting or voiding the warranty.
                                    This action can be taken when the health and welfare of
                                    human life is endangered or when failure to correct the
                                    problem will result in further damage to equipment or gov-
                                    ernment property.

                                    Once the construction inspector/QAE has reviewed the job
                                    order, the job order number will be posted to the warranty
                                    sheet. The job order is assigned to the inspector who was
                                    in charge of this project during construction.

                                    If the Contracting Officer has retained authority for notify-
                                    ing contractors on warranty issues, the inspector will call
                                    them and request warranty work be accomplished. The
                                    contracting office will provide the contractor with the proj-
                                    ect/contract number, the warranty close-out date, the prime
                                    contractor, an itemized description of the failure (using a
                                    worksheet), the condition code (urgent, routine, safety item,
                                    etc.), and request a government representative be present
                                    when repairs are being made.

                                    The contract administrator’s name, date, and time of call is
                                    recorded. If requested, contracting notifies the Contract
                                    Element within three working days of the call (sooner, if
                                    urgent), and identifies who will repair the warranty item,
                                    and when the repair will take place. This information is
                                    reported to the construction inspector/QAE. If, after three
                                    working days, Contracting has not provided the inspector
                                    the follow-up information as requested, the construction
                                    inspector/QAE is notified. The Contracting Officer will be
                                    contacted for clarification as to the status of this work.
                                    Failure to receive a satisfactory answer will result in the
                                    Chief of Contracts Element notifying the BCE of these ac-
                                    tions and asking for further assistance. If necessary, the
                                    construction inspector/QAE will initiate a follow-up letter
                                    for the BCE’s signature.

                                     through the local resident engineer office when possible.
                                     The same information as for a base managed project is pro-
                                     vided.

                                     Once the item under warranty has been verified as being
                                     repaired or replaced, the job order is returned to the con-
                                     struction inspector/QAE and the completed worksheet with
                                     a list of items repaired or replaced is dated and filed in the
                                     warranty folder under completed warranty items. The job
                                     order should be returned to Facility Maintenance indicating
                                     the actions taken. Facility Maintenance will then close out
                                     the job order.

                                     The purpose of a post-acceptance inspection is to discover
 2.7    Post-acceptance

        Inspections                  or during acceptance of facility inspection. It should be
                                     scheduled by the project inspector between nine and twelve
                                     months after physical completion of the project. The in-
                                     spector should schedule a visit with the using agency and
                                     record any latent design or functional deficiencies not
                                     identified prior to acceptance of the project. A standard-
                                     ized post-acceptance form should be developed which de-
                                     scribes the project data, (i.e., title, cost, the final acceptance
                                     date, post-acceptance inspection date, the inspector’s name,
                                     and any deficiencies noted).

                                     After recording items on the post-acceptance inspection,
                                     the form should be posted to the chief of the Contracts
                                     Element for signature and transmittal to the contracting of-
                                     ficer for action. Warranty items should be addressed ac-
                                     cording to appropriate office procedures. The completed
                                     form is filed in the project folder.

                                    ceptance of completed projects.

                                    The primary function of the BCE is continuous owner-type
                                    surveillance of construction as outlined in AFI 32-1023,

                                    plements. The accuracy of surveillance is reflected by the
                                    quality of status reporting and active participation during
                                    the entire execution of the construction contract.

                                    The Contracts Element acts as the representative of the
                                    BCE. As the representative, it will assign a project de-
                                    signer or project manager to be the base focal point for co-
                                    ordination with the construction agent in all matters relating
                                    to the project. This representative will participate in the
                                    pre-bid and site visits and the pre-construction conference.
                                    In coordination with the construction agent, the Element
                                    reviews the site condition and restrictions, construction
                                    phasing requirements, and demolition (For additional guid-

                                    Some important points to understand about MILCON and
                                    P-341 projects are:
                                    (1)    Initiation of the design process for most Military
                                           Construction (MILCON) program projects is started
                                           after the DD Form 1391 has been submitted by
                                           AF/ILEC to OSD as part of the President’s Budget
                                           package.
                                    (2)    A major command or installation cannot change a
                                           DD Form 1391 for a project once that project has
                                           been forwarded to OSD unless OSD requests a

                                           amount approved by Congress differs with the pro-
                                           grammed amount (PA) shown on the DD Form
                                           1391. Once submitted to Congress, the DD Form
                                           1391 may only be changed if Congress did not
                                           authorize and appropriate the project or if AF/ILEC
                                           and SAF/MI must submit a reprogramming package
                                           for Congressional approval.

                                           plus contingencies and SIOH) is greater than 125
                                           percent of the programmed amount authorized and

2.8.1   Cost Control During          Due to differences between programmed amounts, design
        Design                       cost estimates and low bids for MILCON projects, HQ
                                     USAF/ILEC decided to implement a cost control during
                                     design process. The key elements of this process are:
                                     (1)     The BCE, A-E Firm, or design agent prepares a
                                             parametric cost estimate at the Requirements
                                             Document (RD) phase.
                                     (2)     The RD parametric cost estimate serves as the basis
                                             for the programmed amount on the DD Form 1391.
                                     (3)     The design agent validates project requirements and
                                             prepares an independent parametric cost estimate at
                                             the Preliminary Design (PD) phase in work
                                             breakdown structure (WBS).
                                     (4)     Design agent compares project requirements and
                                             costs between the RD and PD phases.
                                     (5)     The user, MAJCOM, and design agent resolve
                                             differences prior to design start.
                                     (6)     The PD parametric cost estimate WBS allows
                                             design agent to establish design budgets by
                                             discipline.
                                     (7)     The design agent compares quantity take-off
                                             estimates during design stages against parametric
                                             estimates and WBS budgets.
                                     (8)     The user, MAJCOM, and design agent resolve
                                             differences prior to continuing design.

2.8.2   MILCON                       The project requirements are coordinated with the using
        Construction                 agency prior to construction start and the AF Form 103,
                                     BCE Work Clearance Request, is generated. During con-
                                     struction, the inspector makes surveillance inspections at
                                     least once a week, documenting construction observations
                                     on an AF Form 1477, Construction Inspection Record. The
                                     inspector will also record a weekly progress report and any
                                     contract modifications executed and/or identified during the
                                     week.

                                     Change order requests initiated by the using agency are
                                     managed by the Element by obtaining MAJCOM approval
                                     and funding. Contracts attends the pre-final and final in-
                                     spection with all of the appropriate base representatives and
                                     follows up on punchlist items with the construction agent.

                                     Upon close out of a project, a DD Form 1354 is provided to

                                     Engineering section. At final inspection, the contractor’s
                                     warranty list is obtained and the prime contractor/sub-

2.9   A-E Liability                  The following guidance outlines a formal process for
      Program                        evaluating contract modifications to A-E designed projects
                                     in order to determine if A-E liability is involved, whether
                                     or not to pursue A-E liability, and how to pursue A-E li-
                                     ability.

                                     A-E firms are responsible for the projects which they de-
                                     sign. In most cases, a quality product is received. In in-
                                     stances where design deficiencies occur, the government
                                     may incur damage and added cost. FAR 52.236-23, Re-
                                     sponsibility of the A-E Contractor, outlines the A-E re-
                                     sponsibilities.

                                     The A-E shall be responsible for the professional quality,
                                     technical accuracy, and the coordination of all designs,
                                     drawings, specifications, and other services furnished by
                                     the A-E under this contract. The A-E shall, without addi-
                                     tional compensation, correct or revise any errors or defi-
                                     ciencies in its designs, drawings, specifications, and other
                                     services.

                                     Neither the government’s review, approval, or acceptance
                                     of, nor payment for, the services required under this con-
                                     tract shall be construed to operate as a waiver of any rights
                                     under this contract or of any cause of action arising out of
                                     the performance of this contract, and the A-E shall remain
                                     liable to the government in accordance with applicable law
                                     for all damages to the government caused by the A-E's
                                     negligent performance of any of the services furnished un-
                                     der this contract.

                                     The rights and remedies of the government provided for
                                     under this contract are in addition to any other rights or
                                     remedies provided by law.

                                     If the A-E is comprised of more than one legal entity, each
                                     such entity shall be jointly and severely liable hereunder.

                                     conflicts with specifications only, and conflicts with speci-

                                     Errors — Includes incorrect dimensions, typographical
                                     errors, and mathematical errors.
                                     Omissions — Omitting from the drawings, specifications,
                                     or both, essential information specified in the Statement of
                                     Work or given to the A-E during the design phase or items
                                     clearly necessary for a complete and viable design.

2.9.1   Design Deficiencies          Design deficiencies may result from a number of causes,
                                     such as inadequate statement of requirements by the gov-
                                     ernment during the conceptual design stage, inadequate de-
                                     sign criteria, insufficient field investigation, and error of
                                     omission. Not all design deficiencies result from negligent
                                     performance on the part of the A-E, nor do all deficiencies
                                     result in damages to the government. Corrections and/or
                                     revisions in designs, drawings, specifications, and other
                                     services are usually accomplished by the A-E’s without
                                     question. However, collection for damages to the govern-
                                     ment resulting from a construction contract modification,
                                     attributed solely to A-E performance, is much more in-
                                     volved and requires careful consideration and documenta-
                                     tion from the time that the deficiency is noted until it is cor-
                                     rected.

                                     When a contract modification occurs in an A-E designed
                                     project, the modifications will be reviewed using the fol-
                                     lowing process to determine whether the A-E is liable for
                                     the damages and if and how compensation is pursued.

                                     The project designer will write the modification and, with
                                     the Liability Coordinator (LC), will determine if a design
                                     deficiency is the cause of the contract modification. If not,
                                     the LC annotates the modification as such and a copy is
                                     placed in the main A-E project folder.

                                     If there is a design deficiency, then it must be determined if
                                     A-E liability exists. This centers around answering “yes”
                                     to all of the following questions:
                                     (1)      Is the construction modification attributable to a
                                              design deficiency?
                                     (2)      Does the design deficiency stem from an act or
                                              omission by the A-E?
                                     (3)      Has the government been damaged by the design
                                              deficiency?

                                     (4)    Does the act of omission by the A-E result from a
                                            failure to meet the standard of care reasonably asso-
                                            ciated with the profession?

                                     The most difficult of these items is to determine the pres-
                                     ence of professional negligence in the A-E’s action or in-
                                     actions. The professional standard of care to be applied is
                                     the same standard that is used in cases involving alleged
                                     malpractice of doctors, lawyers, and other professionals
                                     who sell their services for compensation. This standard
                                     essentially requires an A-E to exercises such as reasonable
                                     care, skill, and diligence as one in that profession would
                                     ordinarily exercise under similar circumstances. If no A-E
                                     liability is determined, the LC documents this and files
                                     copies as indicated above.

                                     If A-E liability is indicated, the LC and project designer
                                     must then determine whether to recommend pursuit of A-E
                                     liability. This is a determination as to whether recovery
                                     justifies the administrative costs which will likely be in-
                                     curred in pursuing recovery. A decision to pursue A-E li-
                                     ability should generally only be made when it is expected
                                     the dollar recovery will exceed the administrative cost in-
                                     volved in the recovery action. If A-E liability pursuit is not
                                     recommended, the LC documents the reasons for that deci-
                                     sion and file copies as indicated above.

                                     If A-E liability pursuit is recommended, all pertinent
                                     documentation is turned over to the contracting officer to
                                     pursue enforcement of A-E liability. This may include the
                                     statement of work, design criteria, DD Form 1391, techni-
                                     cal references, minutes of predesign and design confer-
                                     ences, etc., along with estimates of probable cost.

                                     To correct the design deficiency, the A-E may agree to
                                     reimburse the U.S. Treasury for an equitable settlement or
                                     the A-E may agree to compensate the construction con-
                                     tractor directly.

2.9.2   Determining                  The government cannot seek those costs which would have
        Monetary Damage              been in the contractor’s original bid had the error/omission
                                     not existed. The liability of the A-E firm with respect to
                                     design deficiencies are: (1) correcting the design error or
                                     omission and (2) paying for any additional cost to the gov-
                                     ernment, if any, for implementation of those corrections.
                                     The additional costs are those in excess of what they would
                                     have been had the work been designed correctly. Any

                                     ate as resulting from the firm’s negligence can be included.
                                     Usually, the major portion of damages arises from the
                                     “tear-out” costs required to construct the revisions. There-
                                     fore, recovery costs generally cover tear-out costs and/or
                                     delay damages.

2.9.3   Administrative               In all cases of contract modification, no matter what the
        Actions                      outcome of A-E liability, a statement concerning the cir-
                                     cumstance of the design deficiency will be provided on DD
                                     Form 2631, Performance Evaluation (Architect-Engineer).
                                     The DD Form 2631 must be distributed, filed, and used in a
                                     manner similar to qualifications data of SF Form 254s and
                                     255s. In addition, the information on the DD Form 2631 is
                                     sent to Contracting and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers

Chapter 3 SABER Element Role and Responsibilities
3.1   Background                     The Simplified Acquisition of Base Engineering Require-
                                     ments (SABER) program expedites contract execution of
                                     Base Civil Engineering requirements by reducing design
                                     work and acquisition lead times. It is particularly well-
                                     suited for reducing the BCE work order backlogs and ac-
                                     complishing non-complex construction, maintenance, and
                                     repair requirements. SABER complements, rather than re-
                                     places an installation’s contract program. SABER is very
                                     similar to a civil engineering requirements contract. It al-
                                     lows the BCE to define a general scope of work and then
                                     issue delivery orders against the contract, eliminating the
                                     hassle of competitive bid.

                                     SABER goes well beyond a requirements contract though.
                                     Instead of one category of work, it addresses virtually the
                                     entire spectrum of CE work. At many installations either a
                                     pre-negotiated unit price book (UPB) is used to develop
                                     detailed cost estimates for work to be performed.

                                     Because the UPB only reflects the actual cost of the tasks
                                     listed, some concession must be made to allow for the con-
                                     tractors profit, overhead, and cost of local conditions.
                                     Thus, the prospective contractors only bid on a SABER
                                     contract is on the advertised coefficients. Once the contract
                                     is awarded, each item of work given to the contractor is
                                     priced using the UPB cost multiplied by the coefficient.

                                     In addition to the UPB, the base must establish some con-
                                     tractual boundaries of SABER. This is accomplished by
                                     setting a guaranteed minimum and maximum for the con-
                                     tract. The initial contract duration is usually for the period
                                     of one year, with four, one-year renewal options.

3.2   Basic Definitions              A SABER contract is a firm fixed-price, indefinite deliv-
                                     ery/indefinite quantity contract which includes a collection
                                     of detailed task specifications encompassing most types of
                                     real property maintenance, repair, construction work, and a
                                     detailed UPB. For each of the tasks, the UPB identifies a
                                     unit of measure and a corresponding unit price. SABER
                                     contracts include options for work in years beyond the ini-
                                     tial performance period.

                                     Contractors submitting offers on a SABER contract pro-
                                     pose coefficients. At least one coefficient for standard and

                                    one for non-standard hour work. Others include those for
                                    geographically remote sites, secure areas, and other
                                    bases/agencies participating in the contract. Work tasks in
                                    the UPB represent bare, in-place costs; therefore, the coef-
                                    ficient roughly equates the contractor’s overhead, general
                                    and administrative (G&A) expenses, profit, and local con-
                                    ditions. Total cost for pre-priced work performed under
                                    SABER sums unit tasks and multiplies them by the coeffi-
                                    cient. BCE Work Orders selected by the Work Request
                                    Review Board (WRRB) as appropriate for SABER projects
                                    are provided by the SABER program manager (PM) to the
                                    operational contracting squadron as part of a requirements
                                    package. The SABER PM prepares, as part of the package,
                                    a programming estimate using the UPB, parametric esti-
                                    mating packages, or historic SABER per square foot costs.
                                    The project is then issued as a request for proposal (RFP) to
                                    the contractor by the Contracting Officer. The contractor
                                    reviews the work order, may attend a site visit with the
                                    government, and submits a proposal. Following discussion
                                    and negotiation of quantities, schedule, and other issues,
                                    the contracting officer issues a delivery order (DO) for the
                                    performance of the work.

                                    A delivery order is the contractual instrument issued by the
                                    government to the contractor to order work under an exist-
                                    ing IDIQ contract. A SABER DO is issued unilaterally
                                    (meaning that it is signed only by the Contracting Officer)
                                    after negotiations with the contractor. Each individual DO
                                    becomes, in effect, a fixed-price lump sum contract, and is
                                    administered accordingly. While contracting may issue a
                                    separate notice to proceed (NTP), the contract may state
                                    that the signed DO constitutes the contractor’s NTP.

                                    The UPB is a list of pre-priced work tasks. Depending
                                    upon the source of data used, UPBs may contain from
                                    20,000 to 70,000 line items. Different databases have been
                                    developed by the Army Corps of Engineers and various
                                    commercial companies (including RS Means, Lee Saylor,
                                    Berger, and Marshall and Swift). The key to the quality of
                                    a UPB is the tailoring of the base data (which are priced at
                                    various locations, nationally) to reflect accurate local con-
                                    struction costs. Localization is the critical step in preparing
                                    the SABER contract technical documentation because it
                                    ultimately determines the accuracy of project costs. Lo-
                                    calization of the voluminous data can be accomplished us-
                                    ing computer programs. Like the data sources themselves,

                                     there are government and commercial software alternatives.
                                     SABER contracts may contain provisions providing for an-
                                     nual updates of the UPB as one method of addressing eco-
                                     nomic changes throughout the contract’s life.

                                     The coefficient multiplies the UPB Bare Cost price. This
                                     coefficient represents the contractor’s bid (including, but
                                     not limited to, such elements as overhead, profit, minimum
                                     design costs, G&A expenses, bond premiums, gross re-
                                     ceipts tax, and local labor and material factors) for UPB
                                     items included in Dos. The number of coefficients initially
                                     proposed by the contractor is based on an installation’s re-
                                     quirements (usually standard and non-standard hours, range
                                     or site work, or work in secured areas), and forms one of
                                     several bases for the award of a SABER contract. The co-
                                     efficient also reflects the contractor’s perception of the ac-
                                     curacy of the UPB. Based on criteria and predetermined
                                     formulas contained in economic price adjustment (EPA),
                                     provisions (if present in the contract), coefficients may be
                                     re-evaluated before the exercise of option years to deter-
                                     mine if economic adjustments are warranted.

                                     Non-priced Items (NPI) are real property maintenance or
                                     construction tasks not included in the SABER UPB, but
                                     within the basic intent and general scope of the contract.
                                     Since NPI's are not pre-negotiated, any NPI reduces the
                                     efficiency and economic value of the SABER contract. As

                                     percentage of NPI's allowed in any single DO.

3.3   Advantages                     The primary advantages a SABER contract offers over
                                     standard minor construction are:

                                     Improved customer service and responsiveness. After
                                     the initial contract is awarded, Dos for individual projects
                                     can usually be estimated, proposed, negotiated, and issued
                                     in three to four weeks. This represents a dramatic reduc-
                                     tion from the months required to solicit and award individ-
                                     ual construction contracts. In addition, changes to require-
                                     ments can usually be incorporated in a more responsive
                                     manner.

                                     Enhanced ability to accomplish backlogged work orders
                                     and commander-generated requirements. SABER can
                                     also be used to accommodate “hot” projects that usually
                                     require resources over and above in-house capabilities or

                                     otherwise interrupt the in-service work plan (IWP). Ap-
                                     propriate SABER projects should be determined based on
                                     the past performance of a SABER program and the indi-
                                     vidual contractor. If a SABER program or contractor is
                                     consistently completing projects at a lower square foot cost
                                     than a competitively bid project, then the base should rea-
                                     sonably send the program more projects. On the other
                                     hand, if the SABER program is costly or a poor performer,
                                     then more projects should use alternate contracting meth-
                                     ods.

                                     Potential for greatly improved working relationships
                                     and synergy between BCE, contracting, and the con-
                                     tractor. SABER is most effective when a coordinated
                                     team approach is applied, communication channels are
                                     open and frequently used, and all parties are committed to
                                     making the program a success.

                                     Strong incentive for the contractor to produce high
                                     quality work in a timely manner. The contract guaran-
                                     tees a minimum dollar value of work the contractor will
                                     receive. Additional guaranteed work should not be in-
                                     cluded in the option years. The SABER contractor may be
                                     awarded additional Dos, above the guaranteed minimum,
                                     by performing the quality and timeliness standards ex-
                                     pressed by the SABER contract requirements.

                                     Addition of resources to the BCE. SABER provides a
                                     capability to perform work that is unaffected by deploy-
                                     ments, training, inspections, and other activities that affect
                                     the shop workforce.

                                     Added fiscal flexibility. Associate units can, and are usu-
                                     ally willing to, fund their own projects in order to have
                                     quality work performed in a responsive, timely fashion.

3.4   Scope and                      The SABER program has great potential, but it also has its
      Limitations                    limitations. As stated, SABER is designed to complement
                                     the traditional construction program. It cannot replace it. It
                                     is best suited to reduce BCE work order and contract
                                     backlogs and accomplish non-complex construction, main-
                                     tenance, and repair requirements that meet certain criteria.

                                     SABER cannot replace good planning, project design,
                                     management, and contract administration. The program is
                                     not designed to circumvent other contracting methods

                                                                                      Chapter 3

                                    which may be more appropriate. SABER should also not
                                    be used to exceed established project program-
                                    ming/approval limitations.

                                    Using SABER for projects such as large asphalt, painting,
                                    or other predominately single skill/material jobs can cost
                                    significantly more than a competitively bid contract. One
                                    reason is that it is virtually impossible to quantify all of the
                                    elements that would be required to build economy of scale
                                    factors for each line item in the unit price book.

                                    Due to statutory requirements, SABER cannot be used to
                                    perform non-personal service subject to the provisions of
                                    the Service Contract Act. An example is a delivery order
                                    predominately to install carpet, when the labor involved
                                    exceeds $2,500. The Department of Labor has jurisdiction
                                    over whether a particular requirement is classified as con-
                                    struction work subject to the Davis Bacon Act or services
                                    to which the Service Contract Act applies. Their guidance
                                    provides that services such as carpet installation, landscap-
                                    ing, asbestos removal, and building demolition may be per-
                                    formed as construction when the work is incidental to a
                                    larger construction project. If the preponderance of the
                                    work involves the services cited, although there may be
                                    some incidental related construction work, the project falls
                                    under the Services Contract Act and cannot be performed
                                    by SABER.

                                    The recommended minimum/maximum values for delivery
                                    orders (DO) is $2,000 - $500,000. For projects with values
                                    outside that range, the DO concept using a pre-priced UPB
                                    may result in excessive project costs. Other contract pro-
                                    grams, or in-house work orders, may be more appropriate.

                                    Larger projects are more likely to go beyond the advertised
                                    intent of the program. Projects may exceed $500,000 if
                                    fully warranted by economic and/or mission requirements
                                    and if approved by the installation commander. This ap-

                                             tract limitations, guaranteed contract minimums,
                                             and maximum limitations. The range established by
                                             the guaranteed minimum and maximum amounts is
                                             intended to provide potential contractors with the
                                             government’s expected scope of the total contract.
                                             The guaranteed minimum is a firm obligation and
                                             acts as an incentive to promote interest in the re-
                                             quirement. Unrealistically low or high minimums
                                             may respectively limit a contractor’s interest or re-
                                             quire a larger initial obligation of government
                                             funds. The guaranteed minimum should be tailored
                                             to meet the requirements of each installation based
                                             on historical data, anticipated funds availability, and
                                             other factors which may be known to BCE and
                                             contracting.

                                     The contract maximum establishes a ceiling on the total
                                     amount of orders that can be issued under the contract. The
                                     maximum should be set at an amount that reasonably can
                                     be required over the life of the contract (base year plus op-
                                     tions) with full consideration given to the impact of such
                                     unusual circumstances as major natural disasters.

3.5.1    Project Assignment          All CE work orders are initially processed through the
                                     WRRB to determine accomplishment by either in-house
                                     personnel or contract. Once a project has been referred to
                                     the Engineering Flight for contract completion, the Engi-
                                     neering Flight chief may determine if the project goes

                                     PCMS/PM (See Figure 3).

                                     Projects not in the current design schedule will be filed for
                                     accomplishment at a later date. Projects in the current de-
                                     sign schedule, or inserted into the schedule, are reviewed
                                     for compliance with AFFAR Supplement, Appendix DD,

                                     SABER, the SABER Chief will ensure PCMS/PM is up-
                                     dated with the correct design status and that the AF Form
                                     614, Change Out Record, is filed appropriately. The proj-

                                     project folder.

3.5.2   Preliminary Design           The project manager becomes familiar with the work re-
                                     quest through a site visit with the requestor. The project
                                     manager will develop a proposed statement of work and a
                                     Programming or Budgetary estimate. All project require-
                                     ments must be in compliance with AFI 32-1024, Standard
                                     Facilities Requirements, and AFH 32-1084, Facility Re-
                                     quirements. If work requirements on the AF Form 332 are
                                     revised after discussions with the requester, it is modified
                                     and must be re-approved by the approving authority. This
                                     is also true if the SABER estimate exceeds the approved
                                     amount on the AF Form 332 by 25%. This is coordinated
                                     through Base Development. Preliminary design and should
                                     include any sketches or as-built drawings as required for
                                     the contractor to develop cost proposal.

3.5.3   Funding                      SABER projects are funded by many organizations in dif-
                                     ferent ways. Funding methods, in most cases, should be
                                     determined prior to execution via SABER. The most
                                     common methods of funding follow.

                                     User Funded. Whether the user arranges to transfer the
                                     money through Resources, themselves, or have the project
                                     manager process the appropriate funding documents, the
                                     project manager will originate the documents and have Re-
                                     sources assign a purchase request (PR) number for tracking
                                     purposes. This process will be used for all appropriate
                                     funding documents with the exception of NAF projects.
                                     They assign their own PR numbers and process the docu-
                                     ments to Contracting.

                                     CE Funded. The SABER chief gets approval from the
                                     BCE or Deputy BCE for the project amount before the
                                     project manager completes the appropriate funding docu-
                                     ments. This is usually O&M funding or from the BCE’s
                                     urgent funds.

                                     MAJCOM Funded. When local or user funding is not
                                     available, the project is placed on the approved Facilities
                                     Board Project Priority Listing for all programs. The project
                                     manager will prepare the preliminary design and cost esti-
                                     mate to be forwarded to Contracting. Upon completion of
                                     the contract package, the project manager will update
                                     PCMS/PM to reflect design completion date along with
                                     ready for contracting status and the RTA date to obtain
                                     contracting authority. When the message from the
                                     MAJCOM is received granting advance contracting
                                     authority, the project manager prepares the appropriate
                                     funding documents for the amount of the authority message
                                     and sends the appropriate funding documents and a copy of
                                     the AF Form 332 to Resources. Resources will process the
                                     documents and forward it to Base Finance. While the
                                     funding documents are being processed, the project man-
                                     ager will send the completed contract package to Base
                                     Contracting.

3.5.4   Contract Package             When funding is confirmed on the appropriate funding
                                     documents, the project manager sends a SABER contract
                                     package to contracting. Included in each package are:
                                     (1)   a proposed statement of work;
                                     (2)   a government cost estimate, if required by base
                                           contracting;

                                                                    Note
                                           The cost estimate can be either preliminary, such as
                                           Means, or the detailed UPB estimate depending on
                                           the design required from the contractor. A detailed
                                           UPB estimate could not be expected if the contractor
                                           must complete a design as part of the proposed
                                           statement of work. The cost estimate must be less
                                           than or equal to the AF Form 9.

                                     (3)       an AF Form 66, Schedule of Material Submittals;
                                     (4)       the appropriate funding documents;


                                                                  Note

                                           Attach a copy of the advance contracting authority
                                           message if the project is MAJCOM funded.

                                     (5)       any applicable drawings, sketches, or as-builts of
                                               the facility; and
                                     (6)       the installation communications waiver packages,
                                               along with an independent cost estimate (if project
                                               exceeds the 300K SABER maximum limitation for
                                               each delivery order).

3.5.5   Project Design               When the contract package and funding documents arrive
                                     at Base Contracting, the contract administrator sends a let-
                                     ter to the contractor requesting a site visit to be scheduled
                                     within three working days and the submittal of a cost pro-
                                     posal for the project. The contractor is responsible for pre-
                                     paring a detailed cost proposal and necessary drawings to
                                     properly evaluate the proposal. If the proposed statement
                                     of work is modified at the site visit, the contractor will
                                     submit a revised statement of work for review along with
                                     his cost proposal. The contractor and CE project manager
                                     are free to discuss the details of the project, excluding cost
                                     and performance time, during this phase.

                                     Projects simple in scope should have the UPB estimate (or
                                     equivalent, if required) completed by the project manager
                                     prior to submitting the contract package to Base Contract-
                                     ing. When the contract package is ready for contracting,
                                     the CE project manager will prepare a package and include
                                     a signature sign-off sheet. Upon completion of review and
                                     approval, any changes required should be forwarded to
                                     Base Contracting along with a revised statement of work.

                                     During the design phase, and through the entire life of the
                                     project, the project manager is responsible for database up-
                                     dates in accordance with the PCMS/PM Handbook.

                                     All designs must be in compliance with AFI 32-1023, De-
                                     sign and Construction Standards and Execution of Facility
                                     Construction Projects, including applicable building codes,
                                     life safety codes, and ADA/UFAS requirements. When
                                     modifications are made to existing facilities that affect the
                                     structure, electrical and mechanical systems, or the circula-
                                     tion within the facility, the BCE must determine if the con-
                                     tract documents need to be approved and signed by a reg-
                                     istered architect or engineer. The registered individual may

                                     be either provided by the SABER contractor or the BCE
                                     organization.

3.5.6   Technical Review             The proposal submitted by the contractor includes a cost
                                     proposal (hard copy and computer disk), any revised state-
                                     ment of work, and a performance period. Base contracting
                                     forwards a copy to the CE project manager for review. The
                                     contractor’s electronic cost proposals should merge all ar-
                                     chitectural, mechanical, and electrical work. The CE proj-
                                     ect manager compares the contractor’s proposal with the
                                     government estimate for scope, completeness, method of
                                     construction, and pricing data by running a validation and
                                     comparison through the SABER Program software. If
                                     there are variances, a report will be printed. The project
                                     manager will highlight questionable items for negotiation
                                     and return the proposal, along with a computer comparison,
                                     to base contracting. The project manager may contact the
                                     contractor to clarify only where an item is going or what it
                                     is for. Details of the items may not be discussed with the
                                     contractor.

3.5.7   Negotiations                 After receiving the technical review, base contracting ar-
                                     ranges and conducts negotiations with the contractor’s proj-
                                     ect manager and the CE project manager. When all have
                                     agreed on quantities, line items, prices, scope of work, and
                                     performance time, the contract administrator can issue the
                                     delivery order and "Notice to Proceed."

3.5.8   Construction                 The CE project manager is responsible for coordinating
        Management                   construction with the user(s), inspecting all aspects of proj-
                                     ect construction, and maintaining project documentation.
                                     The project manager is also responsible for weekly updat-
                                     ing of projects in PCMS/PM for status and completion per-
                                     centage in accordance with the PCMS/PM Handbook. Any
                                     projects requiring brief explanations should be addressed
                                     on the MAJCOM/Construction screen under Base Re-
                                     marks.

3.5.9   Documentation                The forms, explained below, are used as documentation and
                                     maintained by the project manager.

                                     The CE project manager approves or disapproves the sub-
                                     mittal and returns it to Base Contracting for final approval
                                     or disapproval. Once Base Contracting has given final ap-
                                     proval or disapproval to the submittal, a copy is forwarded
                                     to the CE project manager to file in the project folder.
                                     Project managers track all submittals on the AF Form 66,
                                     Schedule of Material Submittals.

                                     AF Form 3064, Contract Progress Schedule: The con-
                                     tractor shall submit an AF Form 3064, Contract Progress
                                     Schedule, through Base Contracting for jobs with perform-
                                     ance times of 60 days or more. The project manager ap-
                                     proves or disapproves the schedule and returns it to Base
                                     Contracting. Contracting signs and returns a copy for the
                                     project folder.

                                     AF Form 3065, Contract Progress Report: An AF Form
                                     3065 is submitted every week to the CE project manager
                                     for jobs with performance times of 60 days or more. The
                                     CE project manager will either approve the construction
                                     complete percentage or correct it and update the percent-
                                     ages in PCMS/PM on a weekly basis.

                                     AF Form 1477, Construction Inspection Record: The
                                     Construction Inspection Record is kept on projects over
                                     $25,000. Daily entries are made reporting progress of the
                                     job, problems, and agreements made. These records must
                                     be maintained daily and be as accurate as possible.

3.5.10 Modifications                 A modification is a formal change to a delivery order after
                                     it has been issued. (See Section 2.6.3.1 of this AFPAM for
                                     additional details on contract modifications).

3.5.11 Negotiating                   When a modification is received from CE (containing a
       Modifications                 statement of work for the modification; the cost estimate
                                     for the modification; the difference between the submittals,
                                     and; the difference in performance time allowed the con-
                                     tractor), Contracting will send a letter to the contractor re-
                                     questing a proposal to accomplish the modification. No
                                     official site visit is necessary. When the contractor submits
                                     their proposal, the CE project manager reviews it and high-

                                     lights any items requiring negotiation, runs a validation and
                                     comparison through the SABER Program software, and
                                     returns the marked-up contractor’s proposal. A copy of the
                                     comparison is sent to Contracting.

                                     The contract administrator arranges a negotiation meeting,
                                     if necessary. When agreement on price and difference is
                                     reached and funding is received, Contracting will execute a
                                     modification to the contract. If only authority had been
                                     obtained, Command must be notified of the negotiated
                                     amount to receive funding and then award of the modifica-
                                     tion. The flow of obtaining funds for a modification is
                                     shown in Figure 3. When the CE project manager receives
                                     the delivery order to the contract for the modification,
                                     PCMS/PM is updated to show the modification number,
                                     cost, and new contract completion date.

3.5.12 Final Inspection              The contractor will request a final inspection with the CE
                                     project manager and the contract administrator providing at
                                     least three working days advance notice. The CE project
                                     manager will notify all the individuals of the final inspec-
                                     tion checklist (located in section F of the project folder).
                                     The checklist should show the inspection is the responsi-
                                     bility of the CE project manager.

                                     During the final inspection, all work accomplished under
                                     the delivery order is reviewed. The final inspection is
                                     documented on standard Report of Inspection form.
                                     Punchlist items and the deadline to correct them is noted.
                                     A copy of the report is provided to both Contracting and
                                     the contractor. After all the punchlist items have been cor-
                                     rected, the project manager notes this on the form and
                                     sends a copy to Base Contracting.

3.5.13 Project Close-Out             The following is a list of the items completed by the CE
                                     project manager when the project is completed.

                                     Warranty information is input into the WIMS/ACES. One
                                     hard copy is made for the Warranty Book and one copy is
                                     filed in the project folder.

                                     The final project cost is noted on the AF Form 327, Base
                                     Civil Engineer Work Order, and the job coordinator signs
                                     the form. The original copy is dated and forwarded to Re-
                                     sources. A copy of the AF Form 327 is then filed in the
                                     project folder.

                                    The CE project manager completes the construction data
                                    sheet. One copy is given to Real Estate and one copy filed
                                    in the project folder.

                                    The completion date is posted on the folder and a note is
                                    made if asbestos was removed. Asbestos-related docu-
                                    ments must be kept for 30 years. The project manager pro-
                                    vides the environmental flight with documents indicating
                                    the extent of any asbestos removal.

                                    A set of as-builts and digital CADD file (compliant with
                                    the Tri-Service CADD/GIS format) is obtained to use for
                                    new construction or major renovations of existing facilities.
                                    Red line as-builts are acceptable for SABER projects if de-
                                    sign work is not required. The project manager is respon-
                                    sible for obtaining the signature from the Chief of Mainte-
                                    nance Engineering on a two-way memo showing receipt of
                                    as-builts.

                                    Appropriate shops are given copies of O&M manuals.
                                    They also sign a two-way memo showing receipt of manu-
                                    als.

                                    The user/requester is given the Customer Service Comment
                                    Form Section F of the project folder at the time of final in-
                                    spection.

                                    The project manager reviews PCMS/PM and fills in the
                                    project’s completed status, the date completed, beneficial
                                    occupancy, if any, and warranty date.

                                    The CE project manager gives the folder to the SABER
                                    chief. The chief:
                                    (1)    checks the folder contents;
                                    (2)    closes out the project in the computer and the work
                                           order in WIMS/ACES;
                                    (3)    notes completion date in the master filing folder;
                                    (4)    completes a post acceptance inspection form;
                                    (5)    removes the AF Form 614, Charge Out Record,
                                           from the central filing cabinet and places it in front
                                           of Section B in the project folder;
                                    (6)    removes the SABER tracking checklist and places it
                                           in files; and
                                    (7)    files the project folder in the SABER completed

Chapter 4 Base Development Element Responsibilities
4.1   Overview                       The Base Development Element of the Engineering Flight
                                     is responsible for the planning, programming, and execu-
                                     tion of cost-effective, real property maintenance, repair,
                                     minor construction, and new facility construction require-
                                     ments necessary to properly support assigned missions and
                                     preserve Air Force real property. The Element also man-
                                     ages all tasks associated with the community planning
                                     function, such as traffic management, the installation gen-
                                     eral plan, inter-government coordination, archeological re-
                                     quirements, airfield waivers, and air installation compatible
                                     use zones (AICUZ).

4.2   Planning and                   Planning is the identification of facility work to satisfy cur-
      Programming Real               rent and future mission requirements. A variety of methods
                                     are used to identify facility requirements, including, but not
      Property Projects              limited to space utilization surveys, condition assessment
                                     surveys, facility investment metrics, environmental assess-
                                     ments, energy conservation surveys and audits, and
                                     user/occupant identified requirements.

                                     After identifying the requirements, the BCE determines
                                     project scope (required size or capacity), any special tech-
                                     nical engineering requirements, the project cost estimates,
                                     the most cost effective solutions, and work classification.

                                     Programming is the process of acquiring the authority, re-
                                     sources, and funding necessary to accomplish the planned
                                     work. Real property maintenance by contract (RPMC) is
                                     divided into various program types, depending on level of
                                     authority and fund source. The various programs in which
                                     contract projects are programmed are operations and
                                     maintenance (O&M), Military Construction Program
                                     (MCP), Military Family Housing (MFH), Non-
                                     Appropriated Fund (NAF), medical, Defense Logistic
                                     Agency (DLA), RED HORSE, Host Nation Funding,
                                     NATO, associate units, and environmental. Each program
                                     has its own level of funding authority and documentation
                                     required to validate projects.

                                     Projects requiring MAJCOM, Air Staff, or congressional
                                     approval require a DD Form 1391. This includes a detailed

                                     provided. Also included are site plans, before and after
                                     floor plans, or new proposed floor plans. For new con-

                                     The Base Development programmer classifies the work,
                                     determines requirements, and prepares the necessary
                                     documentation to obtain the authority to execute the proj-
                                     ect. This requires close contact with all base organizations,
                                     associate units, and the MAJCOM. The programmer must
                                     have a wide field of experience in civil, mechanical, elec-
                                     trical, and architectural engineering and have the ability to
                                     envision the final project without the aid of detailed draw-
                                     ings. Usually, the programmer’s only source of information
                                     is the description of work given by the customer on an AF
                                     Form 332. Site surveys, along with customer consultation,
                                     are necessary to refine the scope of work.

                                     When work involves organizational relocation or expan-
                                     sion, required space becomes a controversial issue. Air
                                     Force guidance on space requirements is available in Air
                                     Force Handbook 32-1084, Facilities Requirements. Air
                                     Force Reserve units shall use guidance provided in Air
                                     Force Reserve Command Handbook 32-1001, Standard
                                     Facility Requirements.

                                     Programming actions are auditable and subject to statutory
                                     limitations. After facility requirements are identified, the
                                     programmer develops the project proposals and presents
                                     them to facility board for validation, prioritization, and ap-
                                     proval by the proper authority.

4.3     Work Classification          One of the keys to properly programming facility require-
                                     ments is work classification. Work authorization and ap-
                                     proval levels and appropriate funding sources vary with
                                     work classification. In general, real property maintenance
                                     work will be classified as maintenance, repair, or minor
                                     construction.

4.3.1    Maintenance                 Maintenance is the day-to-day work required to preserve
                                     real property facilities and prevent premature failure or
                                     wearing out of system components. Maintenance includes
                                     work to prevent and arrest component deterioration. It also
                                     includes work required to restore components which have
                                     deteriorated, but have not completely failed or exceeded
                                     their economic life.

4.3.2   Repair                       Repair is work required for any facility (i.e., building, util-
                                     ity system, or other real property infrastructure) or facility
                                     component to restore it to safe, effective, and economical
                                     support of assigned missions and organizations. This also
                                     includes any improvement to an existing imperviously
                                     paved surface.

                                     Repairs include restoration or replacement of components
                                     and systems that have worn out, failed, or exceeded their
                                     economic life. This is accomplished by installing modern,
                                     reliable, maintainable, functional, economical, and energy
                                     efficient materials and equipment. Repair is also defined as
                                     work required to rectify fire or other occupational safety
                                     and health code deficiencies.

                                     Modifications to utility systems (i.e., building, generation,
                                     or distribution systems) to reduce O&M costs or provide
                                     more reliable services are considered to be repairs. O&M
                                     cost reduction or reliability is achieved by increasing the
                                     capacity and/or efficiency needed to effectively support
                                     current requirements.

                                     For buildings, repair includes the addition, rearrangement,
                                     or removal of non load-bearing walls. Repairs are done to
                                     restore a building to functional standards. The repair should
                                     make an existing building fully functional and capable of
                                     supporting assigned missions or organizations effectively
                                     and efficiently. Restoration facilitates the consolidation of
                                     similar functions or organizations and the inactivation or
                                     removal of excess facilities.

                                     If the entire wing or entire building floor of a large building
                                     requires revitalization and is estimated in excess of $5 mil-
                                     lion, it should be programmed through the MILCON pro-
                                     gram. Comprehensive revitalization projects costing less
                                     than $5 million may be accomplished through the O&M
                                     program. However, only one O&M-funded, comprehen-
                                     sive revitalization project may be accomplished in a build-
                                     ing during a five-year period. The intent of this restriction
                                     is to preclude the investment of millions of dollars on the
                                     comprehensive revitalization of a building through a series
                                     of projects accomplished over several years. It would also
                                     be minor construction.

4.3.3   Minor Construction           Minor construction projects are authorized by 10 U.S.C.
                                     2805. Minor construction projects are military construction

                                     projects for a single undertaking with an approved cost
                                     equal to or less than $1.5 million. Minor construction proj-
                                     ects costing $500,000 or less are authorized to be funded
                                     from the O&M appropriation. An exception to this are
                                     projects intended solely to correct a deficiency which is
                                     life-threatening, health-threatening, or safety-threatening.
                                     In these instances, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the
                                     Air Force (SAF/MII) may approve minor construction
                                     projects costing equal to or less than $1 million. Minor
                                     construction includes the following types of projects:
                                     (1)      The construction, erection, or installation of a new
                                              building or system.
                                     (2)      Work expanding the current size of an existing
                                              building by constructing additional functional
                                              space; e.g., by constructing a building addition or
                                              adding additional levels.
                                     (3)      Converting a building from one primary function to
                                              another; i.e., work resulting in a change to the first
                                              digit of the six-digit facility category code. When
                                              repair work is required in the same building, but un-
                                              related to the conversion project, it may be pro-
                                              grammed as a separate repair project and executed
                                              with the conversion project. The programming
                                              documents for these unrelated, minor construction
                                              and repair projects must be cross-referenced.
                                     (4)      Repair-type work which exceeds 70 percent of a
                                              building’s replacement cost. When the estimated
                                              cost to repair a building exceeds 70 percent of the
                                              replacement cost, a replacement building should
                                              usually be programmed through the MILCON pro-
                                              gram. However, when other factors dictate reten-
                                              tion and restoration of the existing building (e.g.,
                                              the case of a building on the historic register), such
                                              repair-type work is referred to as rehabilitation and
                                              is programmed as construction class work (Refer to

                                     cations cables, work on non-real property equipment (e.g.,
                                     equipment listed on the Equipment Authorization Inventory
                                     Data (EAID) account), or installing raised flooring or air
                                     conditioning for computer equipment (See AFI 65-601,
                                     Volume 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures). This type of
                                     work is not subject to the limitations placed on repair or
                                     minor construction.

4.3.5    Demolition Work             The demolition or removal of a facility, or portion of a fa-
                                     cility, unrelated to any repair or construction project is not
                                     considered to be a class of real property maintenance work.
                                     Costs for such independent facility demolition and removal
                                     work should be charged to cost account code 60000 (see
                                     AFR 700-20, Volume 1, Air Force Data Directory, for cost
                                     account codes). If demolition or removal work is associ-
                                     ated with a repair or construction project, the cost for this
                                     demolition or removal work is a funded cost of the project.

                                     authority to the wing commanders. The wing commander
                                     further delegates this authority to the Base or Deputy Base
                                     Civil Engineer.

                                     tween $500,000 to $1,500,000 are funded from the
                                     MILCON unspecified minor construction account (P341).
                                     For projects exceeding $500,000, SAF/MII is the project
                                     approval authority for all P341 projects and submits the
                                     required notification to Congress.

                                     cost of the facility project. All projects exceeding the in-
                                     stallation commander’s approval authority must be docu-
                                     mented on a DD Form 1391, FY Military Construction

                                     must be signed by an appropriate approving official and
                                     must include an approval date.

                                     All project documents must include sufficient information
                                     to allow an independent reviewer to understand the re-
                                     quirement, benefit, classification of work, total cost (funded
                                     and unfunded), impact if the project is not done, and timing
                                     of the project requirements. Using organizations must de-

4.6     MILCON                       Guidance for the planning and programming of major fa-
        Programming                  cility construction projects (MILCON) is provided in AFI
                                     32-1021, Planning and Programming of Facility Construc-
                                     tion Projects. The MILCON program includes construc-
                                     tion projects for all types of buildings, airfield pavements,
                                     and utility systems costing $500,000 or more. It can also
                                     include repair projects costing over $500,000 or more;
                                     however, repair projects are usually accomplished from
                                     O&M funds.

4.6.1    MILCON Definition           Military construction, as defined in the law, includes any
                                     construction, development, conversion, or extension of any
                                     kind carried out with respect to a military installation. It
                                     includes all construction work necessary to produce a com-
                                     plete and usable facility or a complete and usable im-
                                     provement to an existing facility.

                                     Authority to carry out a military construction project in-
                                     cludes authority for surveys and site preparation; acquisi-
                                     tion, conversion, rehabilitation, or installation of facilities;
                                     acquisition and installation of equipment and appurtenances
                                     integral to the project; acquisition and installation of sup-
                                     porting facilities (including utilities) and appurtenances in-
                                     cident to the project; and planning, supervision, admini-
                                     stration, and overhead incident to the project.

4.6.2    Project Justification       The installation programmer must prepare strong, accurate
                                     justification data for MILCON projects. Justification
                                     preparation is one of the most important actions in
                                     MILCON program development and is documented with a
                                     DD Form 1391, FY Military Construction Program.
                                     Variations from sizing guidance in AFH 32-1084, Facility
                                     Requirements, and MILHNDBK 1190 must be justified.

                                     The DD Form 1391 is used to explain and justify installa-
                                     tion facility requirements at all levels in the Air Force: the
                                     Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Office of Manage-
                                     ment and Budget, and Congress. MAJCOMs must make
                                     sure all justification data is clearly stated because there will
                                     be numerous occasions when the DD Form 1391 will stand
                                     alone. Without the benefit of being accompanied by oral
                                     explanations, it will be used at high levels in reaching deci-
                                     sions that impact the approval of the project. It must
                                     clearly describe the impact on mission, people, productiv-
                                     ity, life-cycle cost, etc. if the project is not done.

4.6.3    Cost Estimates              The Contracts Element must develop accurate cost esti-
                                     mates for building the Air Force budget. At a minimum,
                                     these estimates will be based on a completed Requirements
                                     Document (RD) (see AFI 32-1023, Design and Construc-
                                     tion Standards and Execution of Facility Construction
                                     Projects) and a parametric cost model estimate (defined as
                                     equivalent to 15% design complete) or conceptual design.
                                     MAJCOMs will ensure such estimates are developed in a
                                     timely manner so HQ USAF/ILEC can reflect them in the
                                     Budget Estimate Submission (BES) submittal.

                                     General guidance is also included for programming of spe-
                                     cial MILCON programs (i.e., medical, defense access
                                     roads, energy conservation, liquid fuels, Productivity In-
                                     vestment Fund, and land acquisition).

4.7.1    Justification and           The submittal of the justification to MAJCOM for subse-
         Submittal                   quent transmittal to HQ USAF/ILEC must include detailed
                                     information to complement the DD Form 1391 data. A
                                     clear statement describing the requirement, identification of
                                     the existing mission, and the nature of new requirement
                                     should be identified. An explanation of how the mission or
                                     the requirement is being, or will be, satisfied in the interim
                                     is included. A rationale for the submission’s urgency and
                                     why it was not included in a prior year MILCON program,
                                     and why it cannot wait for the next MILCON program

                                     certificate of compliance, signed by the host installation
                                     commander and endorsed by the MAJCOM commander or
                                     designate, is provided.

4.7.2   Approval Process             The approval process for MC begins when MAJCOMs
                                     submit Minor Construction projects to HQ USAF/ILEC for
                                     validation. HQ USAF/ILEC submits validated projects to
                                     SAF/MII for approval. SAF/MII approves the project and
                                     notifies the House and Senate Armed Services and Appro-
                                     priations Committees of the intent to accomplish the proj-
                                     ect. If no committee raises an objection within 30 calendar
                                     days after notification, the notification process is complete
                                     and HQ USAF advises the MAJCOM.

                                     It is Air Force policy to resolve an objection, if raised, prior
                                     to proceeding with the project. For the Air Force Reserves,
                                     HQ AFRC/CE will approve Minor Construction projects
                                     costing less than $500,000.

4.7.3   Execution                    Upon formal approval of a minor construction project, the
                                     design and construction responsibilities transfer to the En-
                                     gineering Flight Contracts Element for project execution.
                                     HQ USAF/ILEC enters the approved project scope and cost
                                     into the Programming, Design, and Construction (PDC)
                                     computer system and authorizes the MAJCOM to initiate
                                     the design. The MAJCOM provides the design funds using
                                     P313 funds, unless design is done in-house. Design proce-
                                     dures should follow the guidelines prescribed in Chapter 2
                                     of this handbook. The MAJCOM requests from HQ
                                     USAF/ILEC authority to advertise the project as soon as
                                     possible after design completion. When an acceptable low

                                     bid is received, the MAJCOM requests funds from HQ
                                     USAF/ILEC for project award. Construction management
                                     follows established BCE procedures as outlined in Chapter
                                     2, paragraph 2.6 of this pamphlet.

4.8    Systems                       The base development programmers are responsible for
       Administration                creating and entering all contract projects into one of the
                                     two computerized databases. When an approved AF Form
                                     332 comes into the Element, an engineering project number
                                     is assigned and the project information is entered into either
                                     the PCMS/PM or the PDC computerized database used for
                                     managing engineering projects. This initial input of the
                                     project data is done by a contract programmer. PCMS/PM
                                     enables the tracking of all projects regardless of execution.
                                     In actual use, PCMS/PM consists of a project directory and
                                     nine specific screens containing detailed information on
                                     each project. PCMS/PM is linked to the PDC database.
                                     The PDC is used to manage MILCON, the MFH P-711/P-
                                     713, and Environmental projects. The benefits as manage-
                                     ment tools provided by the PCMS/PM and PDC are giving
                                     visibility to the enormous engineering effort, making proj-
                                     ect tracking easy, giving everyone access to the same in-
                                     formation, making project coordination easier, allowing
                                     submittal to higher headquarters, providing a vehicle for
                                     communication with higher headquarters, enabling project
                                     approval, supporting project funding, and providing a data-
                                     base to manage design and construction schedules.

                                     The maintenance and continual updating of these systems
                                     are essential because MAJCOM funding is based on
                                     PCMS/PM data and the Facilities Board-assigned base pri-
                                     orities. These databases must also reflect the impact rating
                                     as determined by the Facility Investment Metric (FIM).
                                     Updating the information in facility investment indices,
                                     which are maintained in a separate database, becomes the
                                     responsibility of the various project managers or design en-
                                     gineers. SABER personnel, likewise, are responsible for
                                     updating both the design and construction inspection
                                     screens for their projects. PCMS/PM "user guides" are
                                     available from AFCESA which fully describe the basic re-
                                     quirements for inputting project data into this system.

4.9    Funding                       All project funding actions are coordinated through the
                                     Base Development programmers. Funding issues requiring
                                     coordination with MAJCOM, associate units, or other out-
                                     side agencies are handled by the programming section.

                                     This involves determining the proper funding source,
                                     documentation that may be required, and when funds may
                                     become available. Coordination of funding requirements
                                     effects the overall project execution process from design
                                     through construction completion.

4.10 Miscellaneous                   Various downward directed programs, studies, and analysis
     Programs                        assigned to the Base Civil Engineer are accomplished by
                                     base development programming personnel. This element is
                                     the focal point for facility capacity analysis, consolidation
                                     studies, BRAC questionnaires, and the annual facility as-
                                     sessment programs of the hundreds of base facilities and
                                     common infrastructure assessed annually by commanders
                                     across the base. Programmers input ratings, provide cost
                                     estimates, and identify projects to correct indicated defi-
                                     ciencies.

4.11 Community Planning              The Base Development Community Planning is the focal
                                     point for managing the near-term and long-range base de-
                                     velopment efforts.

4.11.1 Air Installation              The AICUZ is an ongoing analysis of the effects of noise,
       Compatible Use                aircraft accident potential, and land use and development
                                     upon present and future neighbors of the air base. As the
       Zone (AICUZ)
                                     manager of this program, the planner assists the contractor
                                     in gathering updated flight track, frequency, and aircraft
                                     type information, and any other operational changes in the
                                     flying mission. Upon completion of the update by the con-
                                     tractor, the planner arranges a public release of the final
                                     report through PA and the installation commander. Com-
                                     missioners from the county, city, and the local municipali-
                                     ties are invited to attend. The planner attends as technical
                                     adviser.

4.11.2 Traffic Management            The base traffic engineer conducts base traffic counts, as
                                     required, resolves base parking and traffic sign problems,
                                     and responds to formal suggestions.

                                     The engineer coordinates all traffic issues relating to trans-
                                     portation/highway access with the state Department of
                                     Transportation (DOT) district office and/or county traffic
                                     control office. Problems are often solved using conflicting
                                     requirements with no guidelines to follow. Contact with
                                     the DOT to negotiate for the installation commander often
                                     results in developing alternatives to controversial issues.

4.11.3 Archeological                 All matters relating to conservation of historical resources
                                     are coordinated by the community planner. The Historic
                                     Preservation Plan along with the Programmatic Agreement
                                     with the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) pro-
                                     vides the basis for base conservation practices. This plan is
                                     developed by the community planner with the use of con-
                                     tractor and with the agreement of the SHPO and the Na-
                                     tional Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP).

                                     The community planner determines the requirement and
                                     funding sources for pre-construction archeological surveys
                                     and coordinates the results with the SHPO. Before demol-
                                     ishing any building on base, a check of the historical
                                     building inventory is made and conflicts are resolved with
                                     the SHPO. This area requires contact with the National
                                     Park Service, ACHP, SHPO, and various Archeologi-
                                     cal/Historical consultants. A large portion of the work in
                                     this area involves settling controversial issues or negotiat-
                                     ing a resolution were there is no established guidelines.
                                     These issues have a great impact on the base’s land utiliza-
                                     tion and real property disposition. The matters in this area
                                     are handled solely by the community planner.

4.11.4 Waivers                       The community planner prepares airfield waivers, explo-
                                     sive site plans, and explosive waivers for the base. An air-
                                     craft parking plan and airfield waivers map are prepared as
                                     updated for annual submission to MAJCOM for approval.
                                     Through airbase planning methods, construction sitings
                                     must comply with established clear zones and building oc-
                                     cupants are exposed to only job related risk.

4.11.5 Installation General          Base leadership works with the planner to determine long-
       Plan                          range plans, construction programs, and land utilization.
                                     Other development plans include the base Architectural
                                     Compatibility Standards and Interior design standards.
                                     Overall, the planner also provides input and oversees the
                                     development of the General Plan by contract to ensure
                                     completeness of contractual obligation and accuracy of the
                                     plan. Base maps required by the plan are maintained by the
                                     planner who also provides an annual update. The planner
                                     ensures all projects meet the mission objectives and long-
                                     range base development goals. This area requires close co-
                                     ordination with the installation commander and preparation
                                     for briefing VIPs and MAJCOM to project the proper base
                                     image.
