operational utility of military installations.

    4.3. Community economic adjustment assistance shall be directed toward helping impacted
communities to help themselves, using the combined resources of the Federal, State, and local
governments and the private sector to support local initiatives. A community economic
adjustment program shall:

Adjustment Committee (EAC) team, the State, and the private sector may work effectively.

      4.3.2. Identify uniform economic impact information and provide a Community

redevelopment of surplus DoD property, needed to offset the DoD impact.

       4.3.5. Provide for community planning and implementation capacity needed to execute
the community economic adjustment program.

        4.3.6. Formulate plans for productive civilian use of all or part of surplus DoD
installation property in the area.




                                                 3
       4.3.7. Formulate Community Growth Management Plans to guide the provision of
necessary off-base public facilities and services for communities affected by major, new, or
expanded military bases.

   4.4. DoD employees displaced by base closures, consolidations, transfer of functions, and
reductions in force shall be provided assistance under DoD Directive 1400.20 (Reference (e)).

    4.5. The Department of Defense shall seek to maximize the early conversion of surplus DoD
installations to productive and practical civilian use. A community affected by the closure or
realignment of a DoD installation shall be given an opportunity to develop a base reuse plan for
available surplus DoD property.

           5.3.1.1. (Added)(AF) The Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for
Installations (SAF/IEI) is the Air Force designee to serve as a focal point for providing
policy and assistance regarding Community Economic Adjustment Programs.

through MAJCOM PA offices, timely public affairs information and guidance for local
media activities and for briefings for local community leaders and installation personnel.

        5.3.2. Provide the installation commander with timely information concerning the
Economic Adjustment Program in DoD personnel reduction and base closure and/or realignment

           5.3.2.2. Briefings for community leaders.

           5.3.2.3. Briefings for installation personnel.

federal government repositories. If an installation has an agreement with an off-
installation repository to store or display Air Force archeological collections, it must ensure




                                                 5
that responsibility for maintaining the agreement with the repository is transferred to

personnel, local procurement, and construction activity associated with major DoD base
expansions during any environmental assessment process conducted pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act (Reference (f)) or during the basing decision process. This overall
