1. Background. The AMC SA Program focuses on high-priority items of interest within each
functional staff area of responsibility. The purpose of the required semiannual self assessment is
to provide commanders (CCs) with a tool for internal assessment of unit health and to
complement external inspections and assessments. Through the SA Program, CCs and
leadership at all levels can identify specific deficiencies and trends, track corrective actions and
validate compliance.
2. Self-Assessment Policy.
     2.1. All 436 AW units will perform a thorough self-assessment semi-annually IAW AFI 90-
     201 and the applicable AMC and local supplements. The assessments will consist of
     inspection, review, and reporting on all applicable and tracked locally developed, AMC and
     Headquarters Air Force (HAF) self-assessment checklists (SACs). The 436 AW will
     normally perform self-assessments in April and October of each calendar year. Commanders
     may direct a unit to perform a self-assessment at any time; however, units will still be
     required to complete self-assessments during the Wing dictated semi-annual periods..
     2.2. The objectives of the SA Program include:
        2.2.1. Provide early detection of deviations from required standards of performance.
        2.2.2. Identify weaknesses, problems, and trends for management action.
        2.2.3. Identify, disseminate, and act on lessons-learned and best practices from all

4. Management Internal Control Toolset (MICT)
     4.1. Overview. The 436 AW uses MICT for semiannual self assessments. The database
     provides leadership at all levels with real-time visibility of the Wing’s SA status. Accounts may
     be requested at: https://www.my.af.mil/reservenetprod2/mic/mict/MyMICTView.aspx.
        4.1.1. All MICT users should review AFI 90-201, Chapter 6, associated AMC
        supplement, Enabling CONOPS for an AMC Virtual Inspection and this regulation prior
        to each semiannual self assessment.
     4.2. Permissions. There are 9 types of administrator permission levels for MICT: Wing SIP
     Owner (Program Manager), Wing SIP Reviewer, Group SIP Owner (Program Manager),
     Unit SIP Owner (Program Manager), Unit SIP Manager, Unit SIP Reviewer, Unit Checklist
     Supervisor, Unit Workcenter Administrator and MICT Guest. Units will delegate
DOVERAFBI90-202 30 MAY 2013                                                                     5


  permissions as appropriate. Units should refer to the MICT user and training guides located
  in the MICT database for explanation of terms.
     4.2.1. Wing SIP Owner permission is reserved for the Wing Self-Assessment Program
     Manager.
     4.2.2. Wing SIP Reviewer permission is reserved for the Wg/CC and Wg/CV.
     4.2.3. Unit Checklist Supervisor permissions should be assigned to unit leadership to
     view, edit and close assessments on all unit checklists. Typically, Operations Officer or
     Assistant Operations Officer, Superintendent and the Unit CC will be assigned these
     permissions.
     4.2.4. Units will not utilize the Unit Workcenter Administrator permission.
  4.3. Checklists. HAF and AMC continually update SACs. Users should coordinate with
  their MAJCOM FAM prior to each SA cycle in order to verify checklist currency and which
  checklists require completion. In the case of a Wing level program with POCs in each unit
  (i.e. Fitness, OPSEC, GTC), Wing Level FAMs will be the primary channel for contact with
  MAJCOM FAMs.
     4.3.1. Each Dover Air Force Base Instruction (DAFBI) requires a local SAC. Local
     SAC templates are maintained in the MICT database and by the Wing SA Program
     Manager. Creating additional local SACs beyond the content of a DAFBI is Unit CC or
     Agency Chief discretion.
         4.3.1.1. The content of local checklists is at the discretion of the Unit CC responsible,
         however, it should capture all requirements levied on other units. MICT will be the
         source of record for locally developed checklists. Units should maintain local
         checklist files in their SA continuity book in order to edit checklists for future
         changes.
     4.3.2. Required checklists may include Special Interest Items, which will be directed by
     AMC/IG.
     4.3.3. In order to facilitate database fidelity, checklists should be uploaded (tracked) in
     MICT 15 days prior to the SA cycle. These cycles are typically in April and October.
     4.3.4. Checklist user terminology.
         4.3.4.1. Checklist Primary and Alternate. Personnel assigned as a Checklist Primary
         or Alternates are considered subject matter experts at the unit level and will begin the
         SA process for a checklist. Each will have the same access level in MICT.
         Limitations in MICT only permit one Primary per checklist; however, there is no
         limit on the number of Alternates.
         4.3.4.2. Checklist Supervisor (for each individual checklist; different from Unit
         Checklist Supervisor described above). Personnel assigned as a Checklist Supervisor
         will review assessment results as completed by either the Primary and/or Alternates,
         verify non-compliant items (discrepancies) and “Initiate Overall Assessment” in
         MICT for each assigned checklist. Typically, a workcenter supervisor, Section Chief
         or Flight Commander will serve in this capacity. Commanders ultimately validate

       unit compliance, though it is CC discretion to delegate whom will serve as a checklist
       supervisor.
    4.3.5. Data Entry. SA Program Managers will assign the SAC Supervisor, primary and
    alternates in MICT for functional areas within their respective organizations.
       4.3.5.1. Primary/Alternate will “Create New Inspection,” answer SA questions,
       upload supporting documents or links to them and save results. EXCEPTION:
       OPSEC Program Checklists will not be assessed in MICT.
       4.3.5.2. Units will not use the Appointment Letter Function in MICT.
       4.3.5.3. Supervisor will review assessment results, complete deficiencies and
       “Initiate Overall Assessment.” Supervisors will leave the overall checklist status as
       “Incomplete.”
       4.3.5.4. Non-Compliance. Any checklist item marked as No/Non-Comply in MICT
       will be considered deficient and identified as an open discrepancy, requiring the
       checklist assessor to develop a detailed corrective action plan (CAP). NOTE: Units
       will not select Deficiency Cause Code HF12 without Wing CC approval.
          4.3.5.4.1. For Tier 3 (Minor) discrepancies, units will ensure that the CAP
          entered in MICT is a thorough, step-by-step description in the following format:
              4.3.5.4.1.1. Steps that have been taken to rectify the discrepancy.
              4.3.5.4.1.2. A description of each step remaining to resolve the discrepancy.
              4.3.5.4.1.3. Future steps to prevent the discrepancy from recurring.
              4.3.5.4.1.4. Estimated completion date.
              4.3.5.4.1.5. Any supporting documentation uploaded into MICT.
          4.3.5.4.2. For Tier 1 and Tier 2 (Critical and Significant) discrepancies, units are
          strongly encouraged to utilize the AF 8-Step Problem Solving Model as outlined
          in the AF Smart Operations for the 21st Century (AFSO21) playbook to create a
          detailed CAP.
          4.3.5.4.3. Estimated Completion Dates (ECDs) are critical for tracking non-
          compliant items to closure. Input accurate dates into MICT and update them as
          dates change. The intent is to continually update and track all non-compliant
          items to closure prior to the subsequent SA cycle.
       4.3.5.5. Closing a checklist.
          4.3.5.5.1. Checklist Supervisors will not close out checklists or “Complete
          Assessment” in MICT without Unit CC approval. For Wing Staff Agencies, the
          Director of Staff is the approval authority to close out checklists. NOTE: Wing
          CC will be the approval authority for closing checklists containing any Tier 1,
          repeat or higher headquarters assistance required discrepancies.
          4.3.5.5.2. When reviewing the SA data, Unit leadership should verify its
          completeness and that comments and/or CAPs are succinct, written in a
          professional tone and that no prohibited information is included.
DOVERAFBI90-202 30 MAY 2013                                                                    7


           4.3.5.5.3. Upon Unit/Wing CC approval, users assigned Unit Checklist
           Supervisors permissions and/or designated representative (i.e. Group or Unit SIP
           Owner, Operations Officer or Assistant, Superintendent, Flight CC, etc.) will
           finalize the assessment by selecting one of the Compliance Levels described
           below and clicking “Complete Assessment.”
        4.3.5.6. Compliance Levels. There are seven available selections based on AMC/IG
        criteria for overall checklist status. Checklist assessors at all levels will assess all
        checklist items in MICT IAW the compliance levels listed below unless otherwise
        instructed by the Wing SA Program Manager.
           4.3.5.6.1. Comply: Checklist items or checklist as a whole meet or exceed
           requirements IAW the governing regulation (AFI, MAJCOM Supplement, Dover
           AFB Instruction, Operating Instruction (OI), etc.). Note: Comments may still be
           added.
           4.3.5.6.2. Comply with Comments: Checklist items or checklist as a whole meet
           minimum requirements; however, some areas may require action or attention to
           ensure the minimum standard can be maintained.
           4.3.5.6.3. Non Comply: Checklist items or checklist as a whole do not meet the
           minimum requirements IAW the governing regulation (indicating fiscal, manning,
           or other extenuating constraint that indefinitely prohibits discrepancy resolution).
           4.3.5.6.4. Non Applicable: Checklist items or checklist do not apply to the unit.
        4.3.5.7. OPSEC Data Entry (All correspondence done via Encrypted Email).
           4.3.5.7.1. The Wing OPSEC Program Manager will send out the SA checklist in
           Microsoft Excel format to all of the Squadron and WSA OPSEC Coordinators
           prior to the SA cycle.
           4.3.5.7.2. Each OPSEC Coordinator will distribute the SAC to Flights/Sections
           within the Unit as needed to obtain an accurate assessment.
           4.3.5.7.3. Upon completion of the Excel SACs, the Unit OPSEC Coordinator will
           consolidate the information into a single file with separate Tabs for each
           section/flight within the unit that completed the assessment.
           4.3.5.7.4. Unit OPSEC Coordinators will then send the completed SACs to the
           Group SA Program Manager (Group SIP Owner) for further consolidation.
           4.3.5.7.5. Group SA Program Managers should note any findings for their
           reporting purposes, and will then send the consolidated Excel SACs to the Wing
           OPSEC Program Manager.
     4.3.6. Reporting. Each Group and the Wing Staff will submit a SA report through the
     Wing SA Program Manager to the Wing CC no later than 15 days following the end of
     the SA cycle. SA report templates will be maintained by the Wing SA Program
     Manager. Self-Assessment report package should contain:
        4.3.6.1. Digitally signed MFR by each Group Commander, Director of Staff and
        Squadron Commander, listing the following:
