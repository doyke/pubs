                                           Chapter 1

                                   SETTING PAY RATES

1.1. Authority and Guidelines for Pay Setting. Authority to set pay rates rests with the
appointing authority. The Director, Civilian Personnel Operations, Air Force Personnel Center
(AFPC) or civilian personnel officer, acts for the appointing authority. Pay is set in accordance
with the following guidelines.
   • Spend employment funds economically.
   • Don't pay more than needed to attract qualified individuals.
   • Pay employees fairly and equitably.
   • Consider:
   • Local conditions that affect recruiting and retaining qualified employees.
   • How one employee's pay might affect other employees.
   • The qualifications, skills, and service history of the employee compared to the
     requirements of the job.
1.2. Setting Pay Rates. (NOTE: Use the following policies in conjunction with 5 CFR, Part
531, Subpart B and 5 CFR, Part 532, Subpart D.)
   1.2.1. Selecting Rates. The Director, Civilian Personnel Operations, AFPC, or civilian
   personnel officers (until servicing is assumed by the AFPC) or members of their staff are
   authorized to select the proper rates of pay for employees in accordance with the personnel
   action taken. The selecting official does not have the authority to promise an employee any
   specific pay rate.
   1.2.2. Exceptions. The pay setting policies in 1.2 should be sufficient to cover most
   situations. Exceptions may be approved by the appointing authority or designee. Exceptions
   must be in writing and approved prior to the effective date of the personnel action which
   establishes the rate of pay. (NOTE: Exceptions include issues such as the use of highest
   previous rate (HPR) or GS maximum payable rate. MAJCOMs are authorized to approve
   command-wide exceptions to the pay setting policy for conversion or transfer to lower grade
   in 1.2.5.3 and voluntary changes to lower grade in 1.2.8.1.)
       1.2.2.1. (Added-USAFE) USAFE directs expanded pay setting options for all US
       Appropriated Fund employees who accept and are being placed in USAFE-owned
       positions to include family members of military/civilian sponsors. For Non-USAFE/Non-
       AF US employees, pay should be set IAW owning agency/command guidance.
       Employees on centrally managed positions will have their pay set IAW Career Field
       guidance. If no applicable Non-USAFE/Non-AF/centrally managed guidance exists,
       USAFE pay setting guidance applies.
       1.2.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Effective         immediately, Highest     Previous      Rate
       (HPR)/Maximum Payable Rate (MPR) will be used to set pay for conversions, transfer to
       lower grade, and voluntary changes to lower grade.
6                                                     AFI36-802_USAFESUP_I 24 JULY 2012


       1.2.2.3. (Added-USAFE) HPR/MPR cannot be implemented if an employee is
       otherwise deemed ineligible under regulatory guidelines 5 CFR 531.221; 5 CFR 531.222;
       and/or AFI 36-802, Pay Setting.
       1.2.2.4. (Added-USAFE) HPR/MPR rates of pay may not be calculated using pay when
       the employee’s performance was below “Acceptable” (or equivalent).
       1.2.2.5. (Added-USAFE) HPR/MPR will be used regardless of the length of any
       voluntary breaks in service if the situation otherwise meets eligibility for use of
       HPR/MPR.
       1.2.2.6. (Added-USAFE) HPR/MPR applies after completing a temporary
       reassignment/promotion lasting more than one year whether to a GS or alternate pay
       system, even if the terms of the original action specified different pay setting.
       1.2.2.7. (Added-USAFE) This authority cannot be applied to set an employees’ salary
       retroactively.
    1.2.3. New Appointments. Pay for a new appointment may be set in one of the following
    ways:
       1.2.3.1. Minimum Step (Step 1). Pay is usually set at step 1 for a new appointment.
       Step 1 is the minimum rate for General Schedule (GS), Federal Wage System (FWS),
       special rate, or other types of pay systems (e.g., AFI 36-1101).
       1.2.3.2. Higher than Step 1. In rare cases, an employee’s pay may be set beyond step 1
       for a new appointment. The approval must be documented on the SF-50, Notification of
       Personnel Action.
    • Chapter 5 authorizes the setting of pay beyond step 1 for a GS position based on superior
      qualifications.
    • Pay may be set beyond step 1 for FWS positions based on special qualifications (5 CFR
      532.403(b)).
    • Pay is set beyond step 1 for FWS positions when the lead agency for a wage area has
      designated a step above step 1 as the minimum step-rate for hard-to-fill positions.
       1.2.3.3. Other Options. Chapter 4 provides information on recruitment bonuses which
       must be considered before setting pay beyond step 1 for non-FWS candidates (5 CFR
       531.203(b)(3)).
    1.2.4. Reemployment. Employees are reemployed after one of two types of separation,
    voluntary or involuntary. The type of separation impacts pay setting. The following pay
    setting provisions apply to reemployment following a break in service.
       1.2.4.1. Voluntary Separations. A voluntary separation occurs when an employee
       chooses to leave federal civilian service on his or her own, and not at the initiation of the
       agency. Typical voluntary separations include resignation and retirement (includes DoD
       family members who resign after expiration of leave without pay). Unless applying
       superior qualification provisions, the following pay setting rules apply to reemployment
       following voluntary separations:
    • Permanent appointments. Pay for former federal civilian employees reemployed on a
AFI36-802_USAFESUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                                7


    continuing appointment after a voluntary separation will be set at step 1 when the break in
    service is more than two years. If two years or less, GS maximum payable rate or highest
    previous rate (HPR) will be used to set pay, whichever is the most beneficial to the
    employee, provided that the GS maximum payable rate or HPR was earned in the last two
    years.
  • Term appointments. Pay upon reemployment to a term appointment will be set at step 1 if
    there was a break in service of more than two years. If the break is two years or less, GS
    maximum payable rate or highest previous rate (HPR) will be used to set pay, whichever is
    the most beneficial to the employee, provided that the GS maximum payable rate or HPR
    was earned in the last two years.
  • Temporary appointments. Pay upon reemployment to a temporary appointment will be set
    at step 1 if there was a break in service of more than two years. If the break is two years or
    less, GS maximum payable rate or highest previous rate (HPR) will be used to set pay,
    whichever is the most beneficial to the employee, provided that the GS maximum payable
    rate or HPR was earned in the last two years.
     1.2.4.2. Involuntary Separations. An involuntary separation is one that occurred
     through no fault of the employee and not at the employee’s request.
  • Priority Placement Program (PPP), except for Program S (military spouse), and
    Interagency Career Transition Program (ICTAP):
  • Air Force minimum requirement for placement through the PPP and ICTAP. Pay for an
    employee who, after a break in service of more than three calendar days, is reemployed
    through the PPP is set at a step rate at least equal to the current rate for the grade and step
    the employee held at the time of separation, unless the rate is greater than the maximum
    rate of the grade. If the pay is greater than the top step, pay is set at the top step of the
    grade. Compare this rate to that earned by applying the GS maximum payable rate or HPR
    rules, setting the employee’s pay at the rate providing the greatest benefit. (NOTE: In the
    same manner, the current rate is preserved for FWS employees appointed to lower or
    higher paying wage areas under the PPP.)
  • Reemployment Priority List (RPL):
  • Air Force minimum requirement for placement from the RPL. Pay for an employee
    who, after a break in service of more than three calendar days, is reemployed from the
    RPL is set at a step rate at least equal to the current rate for the grade and step the
    employee held at the time of separation, unless the rate is greater than the maximum rate of
    the grade. If the pay is greater than the top step, pay is set at the top step of the grade.
    Compare this rate to that earned by applying the GS maximum payable rate or HPR rules,
    setting the employee’s pay at the rate providing the greatest benefit. Grade and pay
    retention are not authorized upon reemployment from the RPL.
  • Mandatory Restoration. The pay of an employee who is reemployed as a result of
    mandatory restoration rights is set at a rate at least equal to the rate the employee would
    be receiving if he or she never left federal civil service.
  • Workers Compensation. Every effort should be made to restore an employee, or former
    employee, who has partially recovered from a compensable injury and can return to limited
    duty. When possible, the employee should be offered a position at the current or last
8                                                       AFI36-802_USAFESUP_I 24 JULY 2012


      grade held before separated from the agency rolls. If this is not possible, following Office
      of Workers Compensation Program (OWCP) procedures, the employee is reemployed at
      the last grade held and immediately changed to lower grade for the position identified to
      return him or her to the workforce. On the lower grade offer, the employee is given pay
      retention. Set the pay at the rate the employee would have received had they been
      continuously employed, including any within-grade increases (WGIs).
    • Upon reemployment of a prior Schedule C employee whose appointment was terminated or
      who voluntarily resigned in anticipation of termination because of a change in agency
      leadership, pay is set so it does not exceed the employee's highest previous rate or the top
      step of the grade, whichever is lower.
    1.2.5. Conversions or Transfers:
       1.2.5.1. Conversion or Transfer at the Same Grade.
    • Air Force minimum requirement for continuous service.
    • The pay of an employee who is converted or transferred at the same grade during
      continuous employment is set at the step which is at least equal to the current step. This
      applies to conversions to both permanent and temporary appointments and transfers.
    • In a conversion or transfer action of a FWS employee, pay will be set based on the wage
      rate of the gaining installation.
    • In a conversion or transfer of a GS employee, unless entitled to a special salary rate, total
      compensation includes base pay plus applicable locality pay of the gaining installation.
    • The pay of a GM employee moved to a GS position will be set on the pay scale at a rate at
      least equal to the existing rate of pay. If the existing rate of pay falls between two steps, pay
      is set at the higher step.
    • In conversion or transfer of a GS or FWS employee, if the employee meets the eligibility
      requirements for a WGI, set pay to include a WGI if the waiting period was met.
       1.2.5.2. Conversion or Transfer to a Higher Grade. Pay for conversions or transfers
       to positions at a higher grade is set by one of the following, whichever is the most
       beneficial to the employee: Governmentwide GS mandatory promotion rule, FWS
       promotion rule, Air Force repromotion requirement, HPR rule, or GS maximum payable
       rate rule. Pay is set at the step at least equal to the current grade and step.
       1.2.5.3. Conversion or Transfer to a Lower Grade. Unless entitled to grade or pay
       retention, pay for conversions or transfers to positions at a lower grade will be set at a
       step of the lower grade which upon repromotion will not place the employee in a rate
       exceeding that previously held in the higher grade.
           1.2.5.3.1. (Added-USAFE) USAFE directs the use of HPR/MPR for conversions
           and transfers to lower grades if it meets the requirements of 1.2.2. and all applicable
           USAFE-added subsections of 1.2.2.
    1.2.6. Reassignments:
       1.2.6.1. No Change in Pay. Under normal circumstances, pay setting for a reassignment
       action results in no change in pay. Exceptions to the normal circumstance follow.
AFI36-802_USAFESUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                                 9


  • Changes between regular and special pay schedules.
  • Pay will increase when an employee is reassigned from a regular to a special pay
    schedule. An employee’s pay is set at the same step in the special pay schedule as
    received in the regular pay schedule.
  • Pay is usually decreased when an employee is reassigned from a special to a regular pay
    schedule. This occurs because the employee’s pay is normally set at the same step in the
    regular pay schedule as received in the special pay schedule. There are some rare cases of
    exception. The most common is the case of an employee who is involuntarily reassigned
    (i.e., reduction-in-force (RIF), transfer of function, etc.) from a special pay schedule to a
    regular pay schedule and is therefore entitled to pay retention providing the employee’s
    existing rate of pay cannot be accommodated within the rate range. When the existing
    rate of pay falls between two steps, the employee is given the higher step.
  • Changes between wage areas. When a FWS employee is voluntarily reassigned between
    wage areas, pay is set using the wage schedule for the area where the employee is moving.
    When the reassignment is to a position in a lower wage area, the employee is entitled to a
    rate at least equal to his or her existing rate wherever possible. If that rate falls in between
    two steps in the new wage schedule, the employee is given the higher step. If his or her
    existing rate exceeds the top step, the employee is given the top step of the grade to
    which assigned. Pay retention will not be given to a FWS employee who voluntarily
    requests and accepts a position in a lower wage schedule area.
  • Changes between locality areas. When a GS employee is reassigned (voluntarily or
    involuntarily) between locality areas, pay is set on the appropriate rate from the basic GS
    pay schedule. Total compensation includes base pay plus the locality pay for the new duty
    location, unless the individual is entitled to a special salary rate that is more beneficial.
     1.2.6.2. Change in Pay. When an employee moves from GM to GS, pay is set at the
     rate for the same grade on the GS pay schedule that is equal to or exceeds the employee’s
     current rate of pay; i.e., if the rate falls between two steps, pay is set at the higher step.
  1.2.7. Promotions. Pay for promotions is set by one of the following, whichever is the most
  beneficial to the employee: Governmentwide GS mandatory promotion rule, FWS
  promotion rule, Air Force repromotion requirement, HPR rule, or GS maximum payable rate
  rule. If pay falls between two steps, the higher step will be used.
     1.2.7.1. Governmentwide Mandatory Promotion Rule.
  • GS. Generally, the pay of a GS employee promoted to a GS position is set in the step that
    exceeds the existing rate of pay by at least two step increases unless that rate exceeds the
    top step of the grade. If the rate exceeds the top step of the new grade, pay is set at the top
    step.
  • FWS. The pay of a FWS employee promoted to a FWS position is set in the step that
    exceeds the existing pay by four percent of the representative rate of the grade from which
    the employee is promoted. If the rate exceeds the top step, pay is set at the top step.
     1.2.7.2. FWS Promotions. For FWS employees who receive a promotion and move to a
     different wage area, compute the employee’s pay as if there were two pay actions, a
10                                                  AFI36-802_USAFESUP_I 24 JULY 2012


     promotion and a reassignment, processing them in the order which gives the employee
     the maximum benefit (5 CFR 532.407(c)).
     1.2.7.3. Promotions Between Pay Systems: When an employee moves from the FWS
     pay system to the GS pay system or vice versa, pay is set using the appropriate pay
     setting directives for the pay system the employee is moving to. Determine current annual
     salary of a FWS employee by multiplying the hourly rate by 2087 (work hours in a year).
  • FWS to GS: “One Cent Rule”. The GS mandatory promotion rule (“two steps”) does not
    apply to FWS employees promoted to GS positions. To constitute a promotion, the FWS
    employee’s existing rate of pay must have increased by at least one cent upon being placed
    in a GS position. To set pay, accomplish the following: Compare the FWS annual rate of
    pay with the rate range for the GS position the employee is being placed in; the GS step that
    exceeds the FWS rate by at least one cent is the rate at which pay is set.
  • GS/GM to FWS. Identify the action by using representative rates. Pay is set in the lowest
    FWS step that exceeds the employee’s existing rate of pay by four percent of the GS
    representative rate of the grade from which promoted.
  • GM to GS. Pay is set using the GS mandatory promotion rule IAW 5 U.S.C. 5334(b).
     1.2.7.4. Regular and Special Pay Schedules:
  • From regular to special pay schedule. On the regular pay schedule, determine the step of
    the new grade using the GS two-step rule. The employee’s pay is set at that step on the
    special pay schedule.
  • From special to regular pay schedule. On the special pay schedule, determine the step of
    the new grade using the GS two-step rule. On the regular pay schedule find that rate for
    the grade the employee is being promoted to. If the rate falls between two steps, pay is
    set at the higher step. This rate on the regular pay schedule becomes the employee’s pay.
    If the rate is less than step 1 of the new grade, pay is set at step 1. If the top step of the
    grade is exceeded, pay is then set at the top step.
     1.2.7.5. Air Force Repromotion Requirement:
  • Following involuntary change to lower grade (CLG) (employee not at fault). The pay
    of an employee promoted from a grade to which they were changed involuntarily
    through no fault of their own must be set at a rate at least equal to the current rate of the
    grade and step from which demoted. If the employee is on retained pay and that rate is
    higher than the maximum step of the new grade, the employee is kept on pay retention.
  • Following voluntary CLG and involuntary CLG (employee at fault). The GS two-step rule,
    or FWS four percent rule, will be used to set the pay of employees who were voluntarily
    changed to lower grade or involuntarily changed to lower grade when the employee was at
    fault.
  1.2.8. Change to Lower Grade:
     1.2.8.1. Voluntary Changes to Lower Grade (CLG). A voluntary CLG is usually
     requested by the employee for his or her convenience or benefit. Pay will be set in the
     following ways:
  • Policy for voluntary CLGs. Unless entitled to grade or pay retention, pay will be set at the
AFI36-802_USAFESUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                               11


    step of the lower grade which, upon repromotion, will not place the employee in a rate
    exceeding that previously held in the higher grade.
  • Pay retention. In the following situations, pay retention will be granted if the employee’s
    existing rate of pay cannot be accommodated within the rate range of the lower grade.
    When the existing rate of pay falls between two steps of the lower grade, the employee is
    given the higher step. If the selected employee is otherwise eligible and the salary cannot
    be accommodated within the range, pay retention is authorized.
  • Formal training program. Employees who accept lower grades to enter a formal training
    program or Developmental Opportunity Program (DOP). The position must have an
    approved training plan and must be advertised as a training or DOP position.
  • Health issues. Employees who accept a lower-grade position for nondisciplinary reasons
    related to ill health or physical/mental inability to perform the duties of his or her current
    position (under criteria similar to those used in meeting the responsibilities for selective
    placement instead of disability retirement).
  • “Hard-to-fill” positions. Employees who accept lower-grade positions designated as
    “hard-to-fill” under criteria similar to those used for extending special rates under 5 CFR
    530.303(a) and (b).
  • RIF actions. Employees who voluntarily accept lower-grade positions to lessen the
    impact of RIF action will be given grade and pay retention (see paragraph 1.3.1.2).
  • After temporary promotion. When an employee is returned to his or her permanent
    grade after a temporary promotion, pay is set as if the temporary promotion had not
    occurred. If the employee became eligible for a WGI or comparability increase during the
    temporary promotion, pay is set to include that increase.
         1.2.8.1.1. (Added-USAFE) USAFE directs the use of HPR/MPR for voluntary
         changes to lower grades if it meets the requirements of 1.2.2. and all applicable
         USAFE-added subsections of 1.2.2.
     1.2.8.2. Involuntary CLGs:
  • Employee at fault. If the CLG is caused by the employee’s failure to perform acceptably
    or for disciplinary reasons, pay is set at a rate from step 1 up to the step of the lower grade
    which, if repromoted, will not place the employee in a rate exceeding that previously held
    in the higher grade.
  • Employee not at fault:
  • Employees are usually not at fault in most involuntary CLGs. They are typically caused by
    RIF and reclassification. Pay for these employees is set using grade and pay retention
    regulations.
  • Pay for employees who are changed to lower grade because of failure to successfully
    complete a supervisory or managerial probationary period is set under the governmentwide
    minimum requirement. Under this requirement, the employee is entitled to be placed in a
    job with no lower grade and pay than the job left to accept the supervisory or managerial
    position. The employee is also entitled to any WGIs he or she would have received at that
    grade if the assignment to the supervisory or managerial job never occurred.
  • Acceptance of a lower grade by a federal employee in order to accompany a military
12                                                   AFI36-802_USAFESUP_I 24 JULY 2012


     member or DoD federal civilian employee sponsor on a permanent change of station
     (PCS) is not considered to be a change to lower grade at the employee’s request. If the
     existing rate of pay for such federal employee falls between two steps of the lower grade,
     pay will be set at the higher step. Pay will be set at an even higher step in the lower grade,
     in accordance with the highest previous rate rule, if the employee has earned entitlement to
     a higher rate by service in another position.
  1.2.9. Dual Appointments for FWS Employees. When an FWS employee serves under a
  dual appointment (which includes either a temporary and a permanent appointment or two
  permanent seasonal appointments), set pay as follows.
  • When the temporary appointment is at a lower grade, set the waiting period for a WGI from
    the date of the last equivalent increase in the regular permanent position. Set the waiting
    period for the temporary position from the date of the temporary CLG.
  • When the temporary appointment is at a higher grade, credit the time the employee
    spends in the temporary appointment toward the waiting period for a WGI in the
    permanent position.
  • When an employee serves under two permanent appointments, credit the time the
    employee spends in the lower graded position toward the waiting period for a WGI in the
    higher graded position.
  1.2.10. Career Program Positions. Personnel actions taken within the career programs are
  considered "management initiated" rather than "at the employee's request." Employees
  selected from career program certificates or assigned as a result of a policy council chair
  approval of a noncompetitive placement at a lower grade will continue to be paid at their
  existing rate of pay, if it can be accommodated within the rate range of the lower grade.
  When the existing rate of pay falls between two steps of the lower grade, the employee is
  given the higher step. If the selected employee is otherwise eligible and the salary cannot be
  accommodated within the range, then he or she is entitled to pay retention.
      1.2.10.1. Career Program External Applicant System (CPEAS). Employees selected
      from a CPEAS certificate will be granted pay retention if the position meets the hard-to-
      fill criteria. Hard-to-fill positions are experienced when application of a career program
      promotion evaluation pattern (PEP) generates five or fewer highly qualified candidates
      for promotion.
  1.2.11. Overseas Return Rights. When an employee exercises overseas return rights, pay
  is set upon return to the former grade in the United States at a rate at least equal to the step
  rate to which the employee would have progressed had the employee not gone overseas.
  Employees who exercise return rights to a lower grade are authorized pay retention.
  However, if the salary may be set at the lower grade without the need for pay retention, the
  higher step rate will be used when the salary falls between two steps.
  1.2.12. Nonforeign Cost-of-Living Allowance (COLA). When nonforeign COLA is
  involved, determine the nature of action (NOA) and set pay as follows.
      1.2.12.1. NOA Determination:
  • GS to FWS. Do not add nonforeign COLA to GS pay for determination of the
    representative rate. Identify the action by using representative rates.
AFI36-802_USAFESUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                           13


  • FWS to GS. Do not add nonforeign COLA to GS pay. Identify the type of action after
    pay is set using GS pay rules.
     1.2.12.2. Set pay:
  • GS to FWS. Add nonforeign COLA to GS pay to establish rate of basic pay in FWS
    position.
  • FWS to GS. Do not add nonforeign COLA to establish rate of basic pay in GS position.
  1.2.13. Appointments Between Nonappropriated Fund (NAF) and Appropriated Fund
  (APF) Employment Systems. The DoD Employee Benefit Portability Program applies to
  DoD permanent civilian employees who move between Air Force and civil service
  employment systems within DoD without a break in service of more than three calendar
  days. This program applies regardless of whether the move is involuntary or voluntary.
  However, many provisions are applied differently depending on whether the move is
  involuntary or voluntary.
     1.2.13.1. Movement From a NAF Position to a GS Position:
         1.2.13.1.1. Involuntary Movement. Pay will be set at a rate within the grade to
         which moved that is not less than the employee’s rate of basic pay under the NAF
         system immediately prior to the move. In determining the last rate of basic pay, a
         saved pay rate to which the employee was entitled under the NAF system will apply,
         as well as pay received in a NAF special rate position. Additions to pay such as night
         shift, environmental differential, and other premium payments are excluded from
         consideration as basic pay. Basic pay may not be set above the maximum of the grade
         to which moved, except as provided by grade and pay retention provisions.
  • Grade and pay retention benefits apply where the involuntary move results in a reduction in
    grade or pay.
  • A reduction in grade occurs when the representative rate of the position to which the
    employee is converted is lower than the representative rate of the position from which
    the employee moved. For pay banded employees, the employee’s current existing rate of
    basic pay is the representative rate.
  • Prior to moving an employee from NAF Pay Band V to a GS position, the NAF activity
    determines if an adjustment in NAF pay is necessary. Adjustments in NAF pay are
    effected, where necessary, to ensure that the maximum rate of pay retained in the move
    will not exceed the rate of pay for a GS-15, Step 10 for the position and geographical area
    to which moved.
         1.2.13.1.2. Voluntary Movement. Pay will be set at the rate of the new grade which
         does not exceed the employee’s highest previous rate of NAF basic pay. The highest
         previous rate of pay is computed according to 5 CFR 531.206. The employee’s pay
         cannot be less than the minimum rate of the grade of the position.
     1.2.13.2. Movement From NAF Crafts and Trades Position to an APF Wage
     Schedule Position.
         1.2.13.2.1. Involuntary Movement. Pay will be set at the employee’s existing
         scheduled rate of pay; or, a rate which does not exceed his or her highest previous
 14                                                 AFI36-802_USAFESUP_I 24 JULY 2012


          rate of NAF basic pay, whichever is the most beneficial to the employee. However, if
          the highest previous rate falls between two rates of the new grade, the higher rate will
          be paid. The highest previous rate is computed according to OPM Operating Manual
          Federal Wage System NAF, S8-3e. The employee’s pay cannot be less than the
          minimum rate of the grade of the position.
   • Grade and pay retention benefits apply where the involuntary move resulted in a reduction
     in grade or pay. Grade and pay retention benefits will be administered according to OPM
     Operating Manual - Federal Wage System NAF, Subchapter S9.
   • A reduction in grade occurs when the representative rate of the position to which the
     employee is converted is lower than the representative rate of the position from which the
     employee moved.
          1.2.13.2.2. Voluntary Movement. Pay will be set at the rate of the new grade which
          does not exceed the employee’s highest previous rate of NAF basic pay. The highest
          previous rate of pay is computed according to OPM Operating Manual - Federal
          Wage System NAF, S8-3e. The employee’s pay cannot be less than the minimum rate
          of the grade of the position.
      1.2.13.3. Movement From a UA, AS, PS, or Pay Band NAF Position to an APF
      Wage Schedule Position.
          1.2.13.3.1. Involuntary Movement. Pay is set according to paragraph 1.2.3.
   • Grade and pay retention benefits apply where the involuntary move resulted in a reduction
     in grade or pay. Grade and pay retention benefits are administered according to OPM
     Operating Manual - Federal Wage System NAF, Subchapter S9.
   • A reduction in grade occurs when the representative rate of the position to which the
     employee is converted is lower than the representative rate of the position from which
     the employee moved. For pay banded employees, the employee’s current existing rate of
     basic pay is the representative rate.
          1.2.13.3.2. Voluntary Movement. Pay is set according to paragraph 1.2.3.
1.3. Grade and Pay Retention:
   1.3.1. Grade Retention. Grade retention applies when:
   • An eligible employee moves to a lower-grade position through RIF or a situation that the
     Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Civilian Personnel Policy) (DASD(CPP)) decides
     is comparable to a RIF. Grade retention is applicable if the employee has served for 52
     consecutive weeks or more in a position or positions under a covered pay schedule at a
     grade or grades higher than the position in which the employee is being placed (see 5 CFR
     536.103(c)(1) and (3) for additional guidance).
   • An employee's position has been reduced in grade as a result of reclassification. Grade
     retention is applicable if the employee's current position has been classified for a
     continuous period of at least one year immediately before the position is classified at a
     lower grade.
   • An eligible employee is placed through the Priority Placement Program, without a break
     in service of three days or less, including those resulting from early registration, even
AFI36-802_USAFESUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                           15


    though the employee does not have a specific RIF notice.
  • DoD authorizes grade retention for other reasons, for example, drawdown of an installation.
     1.3.1.1. Title 5 CFR 536.103(b) allows the head of an agency to offer grade retention
     under certain circumstances to employees who meet general eligibility requirements but
     do not have a specific entitlement by law or regulation.
     1.3.1.2. Within DoD, grade retention applies when:
  • An employee receives a RIF notice proposing a change to lower grade or separation and
    accepts a lower-grade position at the same or another DoD activity. If the position
    accepted is not a grade lower than one which has been offered by his or her activity, grade
    retention will be granted. If the position accepted is at a grade lower than one which has
    been offered, grade retention may be granted, provided the employee meets all other
    eligibility requirements and management determines that placement in the position is in
    the government's interest. (NOTE: In the Air Force, if they do not meet the other
    eligibility requirements for grade retention under this provision, but would otherwise be
    granted grade retention, pay retention will be authorized providing the employee’s existing
    rate of pay cannot be accommodated within the rate range of the lower grade. When the
    existing rate of pay falls between two steps of the lower grade, the employee is given the
    higher rate.)
  • An employee in an organization undergoing realignment or reduction, who is not personally
    impacted by those actions, requests a CLG. He or she may be granted grade retention only
    if management determines that the employee’s CLG will result in placement of the
    employee in a more suitable position and will lessen or avoid the impact of the RIF on
    other employees.
  • Under other circumstances, for example, restructuring when RIF is not involved, when
    approved by DoD on an individual case basis. Requests must be fully documented and
    forwarded through the respective MAJCOM to HQ USAF/DPCE, 1040 Air Force
    Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1040 for processing to DoD.
     1.3.1.3. Eligible employees are entitled to a 2-year grade retention period unless
     terminated in accordance with the provisions of 5 CFR 536.208; for example, declining a
     reasonable offer.
     1.3.1.4. In other circumstances not covered by this chapter, as determined by HQ
     USAF/DPC, resulting from personnel actions initiated by management to further the
     agency’s mission, to the extent that the intent of applicable law and regulation is met.
     Requests for grade retention must be fully documented and forwarded through the
     respective MAJCOM to HQ USAF/DPCE, 1040 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC
     20330-1040.
  1.3.2. Grade Retention for FWS Employees Who Move From a High to a Low Wage
  Area. In most cases, FWS employees under grade retention will continue to receive the
  same rate of basic pay. Under some circumstances, for example, movement from one wage
  area to another wage area, the employee's rate of pay is determined by the schedule in the
  new wage area. In determining the employee's pay, the employee is entitled to the greater of:
  •The basic pay held before moving;
16                                                  AFI36-802_USAFESUP_I 24 JULY 2012


  •Rate from new schedule for same step held before moving; or
  •Lowest rate from the new wage schedule which equals or exceeds pay before moving.
     1.3.2.1. Frequently the movement of a FWS employee from a high wage area to an area
     with a lower wage schedule will result in the employee's existing rate of pay exceeding
     step 5 of his or her retained grade on the new geographic (lower) wage schedule. In such
     cases, the employee continues to retain his or her basic pay before the movement.
     1.3.2.2. FWS Within-Grade Increases Under Grade Retention. During the 2-year grade
     retention period, a FWS employee is entitled to WGIs in the retained grade unless the rate
     of basic pay, as determined under grade retention provisions, is above step 5 on the pay
     schedule in the new wage area. The WGI is based on the pay schedule in the new wage
     area. For example, if an employee’s retained grade and rate of basic pay equals WG-5,
     step 2, and the employee becomes eligible for step 3, and step 3 is 30 cents more than
     step 2 on the "new schedule," then this amount would be added to the employee's retained
     rate of pay.
     1.3.2.3. FWS Annual Adjustments Under Grade Retention. Annual adjustments are
     based on the "new" schedule, that is, the schedule in the different geographic area. If the
     employee is in any step but step 0, he or she will be paid the rate for his or her step on the
     new schedule. Employees receive 100 percent of the annual adjustment during the 2-year
     grade retention period. Employees in step 0 receive the difference between step 5 on the
     previous schedule and step 5 on the new adjusted schedule. These "adjustments" are
     added to the employee's existing retained rate of pay.
     1.3.2.4. Decrease in Wage Schedule Under Grade Retention. When pay is adjusted up,
     the employee is entitled to the new rate of pay for the retained grade and step. While 5
     CFR does not directly address pay schedule decreases, it does state that the retained grade
     is to be treated as the grade of the employee's position for most purposes; therefore, the
     employee should be paid at the new rate, whether it results from an increase or decrease
     in the pay schedule. Employees on grade retention can waive their grade retention
     entitlement (5 U.S.C. 5362(d) (4)), however, such waiver does not result in eligibility for
     pay retention. An employee entitled to grade retention will receive pay retention only as a
     result of the expiration of the 2-year period of grade retention.
  1.3.3. Pay Retention. Pay retention is provided when:
  • The grade retention period ends.
  • Under other circumstances when an employee's pay would otherwise be reduced.
     1.3.3.1. Within DoD, pay retention will be granted when:
  • An employee accepts a lower-grade position designated in advance as hard-to-fill under
    criteria similar to those used for extending special rates under 5 CFR 530.303(a) and (b).
  • An employee is reduced in grade upon return from an overseas assignment according to the
    terms of a preestablished agreement. This includes employees who are released from the
    period of service specified in their current transportation agreement due to a
    management initiated action, and employees who have completed more than one year
    under their current agreement and who are released from the specified period of service
    because of compelling personal reasons of a humanitarian or compassionate nature, such
AFI36-802_USAFESUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                             17


    as may involve physical or mental health or circumstances over which the employee has
    no control. Also included are nondisplaced overseas employees with no obligation to
    return who are covered by DoD 1400.20-1-M, DoD Program for Stability of Civilian
    Employment, Policies, Procedures, and Programs Manual, September 1990, with
    Changes 1 through 3 (chapter 6, paragraph C).
  • An Army or Air Force reserve technician has or is scheduled to lose eligibility through no
    fault of his or her own (that is, "status quo" employees), and he or she accepts placement in
    a lower grade non- reserve position. (NOTE: In the Air Force, pay retention is not
    authorized when an air reserve technician (ART) accepts a voluntary CLG in lieu of
    separation under the high year of tenure (HYT) program.)
  • Former employees, who have been receiving injury compensation, accept a job offer to a
    position with a lower grade than the last position held in order to return to active
    employment.
  • An employee accepts a lower-grade position for nondisciplinary reasons of ill health
    under criteria similar to those used in meeting the responsibilities for selective placement
    instead of disability retirement.
     1.3.3.2. Pay retention may be extended to employees when:
  • Authorized by HQ USAF/DPC, as a result of personnel actions initiated by management
    to further the Air Force's mission, to the extent that the general intent of grade and pay
    retention are met.
     1.3.3.3. Pay retention will not be extended when an employee is returning from an
     overseas assignment because of unacceptable performance (as defined in 5 CFR, Part
     432) or personal cause (as defined in 5 CFR, Part 752).
     1.3.3.4. Unless otherwise entitled to pay retention, employees selected for overseas
     positions are not authorized pay retention, except as provided in paragraphs 1.2.10 and
     1.3.3.2.
  1.3.4. Pay Retention for FWS Employees. Pay retention will not be given to a FWS
  employee who voluntarily requests and accepts a position in a lower wage schedule area.
     1.3.4.1. When there is entitlement to pay retention, that is, at the end of the 2-year grade
     retention period, a FWS employee is entitled to:
  • Lowest scheduled rate of basic pay in the employee's grade after the action is taken which
    equals or exceeds his or her current rate of basic pay (NOTE: When the rate of pay falls
    between two scheduled rates, the employee will be placed in the higher of the two rates).
  • When there is no rate that equals or exceeds the employee's current rate of pay, the
    employee will retain either his or her current rate of basic pay or 150 percent of the
    maximum rate of basic pay for the employee's grade after the action is taken, whichever is
    less.
     1.3.4.2. FWS Annual Adjustments Under Pay Retention. A FWS employee is
     entitled to 50 percent of the amount of each annual adjustment in the maximum rate of
     basic pay payable to his or her grade. Adjustment will be made prior to a comparison
 18                                                   AFI36-802_USAFESUP_I 24 JULY 2012


       with the maximum step of the grade to decide whether the employee stops receiving a
       retained rate.
       1.3.4.3. Decrease in Wage Schedule. When there is a decrease in the wage schedule, an
       employee entitled to retained pay will continue to receive the rate that was in effect prior
       to the decrease. There is no legal authority for a reduction in pay under these
       circumstances.
1.4. Apprentice and Shop Trainee. When employees are receiving training and instruction
designed to qualify them to perform all required duties in trade and craft occupations specified in
Air Force approved training programs, they are paid under a special pay plan for such programs.
The special pay plan can be used only for apprentices or shop trainees. To establish a special pay
plan for apprentice and shop trainees and to set pay rates see OPM Operating Manual - Federal
Wage System, Subchapter 11.
1.5. Changing Pay Rates. Change pay rates only when you take a personnel action which
changes an employee's:
   •Position.
   •Grade.
   •Type of appointment.
AFI36-802_USAFESUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                             19

                          DUAL PAY AND DUAL EMPLOYMENT

2.1. Dual Pay and Dual Employment Responsibilities. Applicants and employees who
receive a federal annuity or compensation from any other federal source than their Air Force
civilian employment must inform their servicing personnel office.
   2.1.1. The servicing personnel office:
   • Explains to employees how dual pay and dual employment restrictions affect them.
   • Notifies OPM, for civilian annuitants, and the appropriate uniformed service finance center,
     for military annuitants, concerning the federal civilian pay.
   • Notifies the appropriate uniformed service finance center of approved and terminated dual
     compensation waivers and ensures that employees are fully informed of the current status of
     such waivers.
   • Provides a copy of each SF 50, Notification of Personnel Action, to other federal
     agencies when employees work simultaneously for two or more agencies.
   2.1.2. OPM or the finance center determines the reduction in pay for civilian annuitants or
   the amount of military retired or retainer pay to be withheld.
   2.1.3. Employees remain financially liable even if the uniformed service finance center or
   the servicing personnel office fail to terminate waivers on a timely basis.
2.2. Dual Compensation Restriction Waivers. The following are conditions under which
waivers of compensation restrictions for retired military and federal civilian personnel may be
made:
   • OPM may authorize such waivers under the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act
     of 1990 (FEPCA) when there are:
   • Exceptional difficulties in recruiting or retaining qualified candidates for particular
     positions.
   • Emergency conditions involving an immediate and direct threat to life or property.
   • OPM has delegated the authority to DoD for employees who accept placement in
     positions at an installation that is within two years of its selected closure date and for
     temporary positions.

NOTE:
See table Table A3.1 for a quick reference on waiver authority.
   2.2.1. The OPM and DoD must approve these waivers:
   • Individually.
   • Only after deciding that a position is critical to an installation's mission.
   2.2.2. Base closure waivers may not be approved under this authority for:
   • Current DoD employees serving with reduced salary or retirement pay under the
20                                                 AFI36-802_USAFESUP_I 24 JULY 2012


     provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5532, 8344, or 8468.
  • Current DoD employees who become eligible to retire during the year before a base closes.

  • Former military or civilian personnel of installations in the same commuting area who
    retired under an early optional retirement or discontinued service provisions or who
    received any special bonus or incentive for separation.
  2.2.3. Requests for waivers must contain:
  • Identification of the individual requiring the waiver.
  • Appointing authority to be used.
  • Position to which employee will be appointed.
  • A properly classified position description or core personnel document for the current
     position.
  • A fully completed application for federal employment for the position, signed by the
     individual under consideration.
  • A Civil Service Retirement System or Federal Employee Retirement System claim number,
     if any.
  • The date of retirement, the type of retirement (voluntary, discontinued service, disability,
     and so forth), and the amount of current annuity, retired, or retainer pay.
  • An in-depth analysis of the individual's qualifications that meet the emergency need or
    critical skills shortage.
  • Certification by the individual that he or she will not accept the position if pay or
    retirement is reduced.
  • Documentation of bona fide offers of non-federal employment, if any.
  • Qualification requirements, including any selective factors or other specific requirements,
    that would justify the submission. If the installation uses a vacancy announcement it should
    be included.
  2.2.4. Processing Waiver Requests. Requests for nontemporary positions may be based on
  an emergency hiring need, severe difficulty in recruitment, or the need to retain a particular
  individual. Requests must be fully documented in accordance with the requirements of 5
  CFR 553.
      2.2.4.1. Send requests through the servicing MAJCOM to HQ USAF/DPCC, 1040 Air
      Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1040, for review and forwarding to DoD and
      OPM.
      2.2.4.2. Send requests for Senior Executive Service (SES) and Senior Level (SL and ST)
      through the servicing MAJCOM to AFDPS, 1040 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC
      20330-1040.
  2.2.5. The DoD rarely approves waivers for individuals who have taken advantage of early
  retirement or separation bonus options at locations outside the commuting area.

                                    OVERTIME WORK

3.1. Responsibilities:
   3.1.1. Commanders. Commanders must continually ensure that overtime work occurs only
   pursuant to mission needs.
       3.1.1.1. Review Defense Civilian Pay System (DCPS) reports:                  P6602R04,
       Overtime/Compensatory Time Review; P6602R05, Overtime/Compensatory Time Usage
       Report; and P6605R01, Control of Hours Report, to identify trends in excessive overtime
       usage.
       3.1.1.2. Perform self-inspection of overtime and compensatory time usage and
       documentation.
   3.1.2. Supervisors:
   • Establish tours of duty which require the payment of premium pay rates (for example,
     night work, Sunday work, overtime, holiday and so forth) only when the mission requires
     this work for efficient operations.
   • Obtain approval from their overtime authorizing official before ordering overtime (AF
     Form 428, Request for Overtime, Holiday Premium Pay, and Compensatory Time).
     EXCEPTION: In an emergency, the supervisor may order overtime without authorization
     but must document the overtime no later than the following workday.
   • Consider changing tours of duty involving the assignment of overtime when the
     requirement conflicts with an employee's religious obligations or practices by permitting
     the employee to perform the overtime on another day or to excuse him or her from the
     assignment. EXCEPTION:          If failure to perform the overtime will prevent
     accomplishment of the mission, the employee is expected to perform the overtime.
   • Release employees from overtime if the additional work would impair health or efficiency
     or cause extreme hardship.
   • Schedule temporary duty (TDY) travel within an employee's regularly scheduled tour of
     duty to the maximum extent possible to avoid paying overtime.
   • Compare employee travel vouchers with time and attendance reports to determine if there is
     an entitlement to overtime.
   • Record approved travel-related overtime on the attendance records.
   • Prepare and process corrected time and attendance records when required.
   3.1.3. Employees:
   • May not receive overtime pay for work which a supervisor did not properly authorize and
     approve (except employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) who are suffered
     and permitted to work overtime (5 CFR 551.401)).
   • Provide a copy of their travel settlement voucher on which overtime is based to their
     supervisor.
 22                                                    AFI36-802_USAFESUP_I 24 JULY 2012


3.2. Recording TDY Travel Requirement. When TDY outside regularly-scheduled duty
hours is essential and the employee is not entitled to overtime pay, the official ordering the
travel:
   • Records the reasons for ordering travel at that time.

   • Gives a copy of the record to the employee when requested.
   3.2.1. Installations using automated time-and-attendance systems (like the Defense Civilian
   Payroll System [DCPS]) are not required to send additional documentation for overtime to
   the civilian payroll office unless local procedures require it.
   3.2.2. Officials certifying time and attendance, or their designees, must maintain required
   documentation to support the automated time and attendance record.
3.3. Administratively Uncontrollable Overtime. Employees may receive pay for
administratively uncontrollable overtime (AUO) on an annual basis if the MAJCOM and HQ
USAF/DPCE approve the arrangement. The request for AUO must be submitted in writing and
forwarded through the MAJCOM to HQ USAF/DPCE.
   3.3.1. The written request must contain:
   • Title, series, and grade of position.
   • Brief description of the duties and responsibilities of the position.
   • Justification for payment of AUO.
   • Copy of the position description.
   3.3.2. Requests for AUO for positions in Services must contain a brief explanation why
   effective scheduling of the employee under the organizational flight structure cannot
   eliminate the need for AUO. Requests must be coordinated through the installation's
   respective MAJCOM/DPC and Services Director prior to submission to HQ USAF/DPCE.

                                            Chapter 4

   RECRUITMENT AND RELOCATION BONUSES; RETENTION ALLOWANCES;
                   SUPERVISORY DIFFERENTIALS

4.1. Introduction. In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5753-5755 and 5 CFR 575 the Air Force may
authorize special bonuses, allowances, and differentials to alleviate recruiting and retention
problems because of differences in federal and non-federal pay for comparable positions or to
correct pay inequities between a supervisor and subordinate.
   4.1.1. The Air Force may not:
   • Use these special payments as a substitute for the classification process.
   • Grant special payments automatically to all new hires or transferees.
   4.1.2. The bonus, allowance, or differential will be based on the employee's retained rate
   when the employee is entitled to grade or pay retention.
   4.1.3. Except as provided in this chapter, the approving official is the individual with
   personnel appointing authority. In the Air Force, the official normally vested with such
   authority is the installation commander. The authority may be further delegated.
   4.1.4. (Added-USAFE) Each Directorate/NAF/Wing is required to submit their anticipated
   use of incentives/PCSs for each FY and to document how many incentives/PCSs they will
   budget for each FY to HQ USAFE/A1K by the deadline outlined by HQ USAFE/A1KC.
   Year-out/recurring succession planning and recruitment analysis will be a critical decision
   making tool for approval/disapproval of the incentive and PCS allocation. It is a core
   requirement of an organization’s Civilian Employment Plan (CEP) that Civilian Personnel
   Sections (CPSs) provide full/complete documentation succession planning to meet their US
   Incentives.
   4.1.5. (Added-USAFE) At the start of the fiscal year, the CPS is responsible for including a
   slide in the civilian resources corporate board (CRCB) showing the local
   Recruitment/Retention/Relocation Incentives that are likely to be needed/anticipated for the
   duration of the FY.
   4.1.6. (Added-USAFE) For US Civilians, this will require detailed succession planning
   based on DEROS management, retirement information, organizational Commander decision
   to support, historical/forecasted recruitment issues, etc.
   4.1.7. (Added-USAFE) Every attempt should be made to work these in through the CRCB
   in order to ensure highest, and continued, visibility. Only in rare instances when the incentive
   cannot be planned for in advance should requests be worked out-of-cycle. Examples of these
   instances may include an unexpected vacancy due to early Date Eligible for Return From
   Overseas (DEROS), or when a position is new and so unusual recruitment needs cannot be
   forecasted.
   4.1.8. (Added-USAFE) Approvals and disapprovals must be documented and recorded in
   CRCB minutes or out-of-cycle documentation.
 24                                                  AFI36-802_USAFESUP_I 24 JULY 2012


   4.1.9. (Added-USAFE) The status of incentives (i.e. those forecasted, those previously
   forecasted vs. actual needed and/or those requested out of cycle) will either be a primary or a
   back-up slide at every CRCB to ensure continued cognizance of incentives.
   4.1.10. (Added-USAFE) Incentives will be paid from an employee’s normal civilian pay
   appropriation.
4.2. Recruitment, Relocation, and Retention Payment Offer and Approval. The following
officials may recommend, coordinate, and approve payments under this paragraph. See tables
Table A3.1 and Table A4.1 for a quick reference on Air Force pay flexibilities and approval
authority.
   4.2.1. Category I Employees (Centrally Funded/Managed Positions, such as PALACE
   Acquire, COPPER Cap, and Career Development/Broadeners):

      4.2.2.3. Approve: Installation Commander (appointing official) or designee.
   4.2.3. Category IIb Employees (Career SES, Senior Level (SL), and Scientific and
   Professional (ST)):
      4.2.3.1. Recommend: MAJCOM Commander.
      4.2.3.2. Coordinate: HQ USAF/DP.
      4.2.3.3. Approve: Executive Resources Board (NOTE: Limited term and emergency
      SES appointments are approved by SAF/OS).
   4.2.4. Category IIc Employees (Noncareer SES):
      4.2.4.1. Recommend: SAF/AA.
      4.2.4.2. Coordinate: Executive Resources Board.
      4.2.4.3. Approve: Secretary or Deputy Secretary of Defense.
   4.2.5. Category IIc Employees (Schedule C Employees):
      4.2.5.1. Recommend: SAF/AA.
      4.2.5.2. Coordinate: 11 MSS/CC.

   Including Civilian Faculty Members at Air University and the Air Force Academy):
AFI36-802_USAFESUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                            25


     4.2.6.1. Recommend: Gaining Supervisor.
     4.2.6.2. Coordinate: Second-Level Supervisor.
        4.2.6.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Coordinate: The CPSs must review and provide
        recommendation to the Approving Authority.
     4.2.6.3. Approve: Installation Commander (appointing official) or designee.
  4.2.7. (Added-USAFE) Incentive Requirements.
     4.2.7.1. (Added-USAFE) Recruitment Incentives may be paid (up to 25% of the annual
     rate of pay) to a newly appointed/re-appointed employee to fill a position that would
     otherwise be “hard to fill”. In return the employee must sign a Service Agreement.
        4.2.7.1.1. (Added-USAFE) . Recruitment Incentives may be paid to employees
        newly appointed to Federal Government, or former employees with a break in
        government service of at least 90 days.
        4.2.7.1.2. (Added-USAFE) The manager, with CPS assistance, must document (in
        writing) the basis for determining the position is “hard to fill” in absence of a
        Recruitment Incentive. (Also see 5 CFR 575.106)
            4.2.7.1.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Incentives may be used in conjunction with a
            competitive fill, a management-directed reassignment/ change-to-lower-grade
            (CLG), or a non-competitive re-promotion personnel action. Incentives are to
            increase the likelihood of high-quality employees applying for hard-to-fill
            positions. It is a tool and should only be used as a tool to encourage applicants to
            seek AF civilian positions. The criteria for offering an incentive are based on a
            position analysis. Each incentive paid is based on a determination that the office
            with the vacancy would encounter difficulty in filling the position, absent the
            incentive. The decision to offer an incentive must be made prior to submitting a
            Request for Personnel Action (RPA) to the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC).
            In determining whether an incentive could be paid, the following five criteria are
            established to help managers determine if an incentive is appropriate.
            4.2.7.1.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Need          for   Expedited      Hiring    Authority/
            (EHA)/Direct Hiring Authority (DHA)/Schedule A Authority for Cyber Positions.
            DoD/AF Mission Critical Occupations (MCO). Less than 5 Eligible Applicants on
            previous/similar Referral Certificate (same grade, location & series) Located at a
            hard-to-fill (HTF) location as determined by the local CPS. Request for
            Personnel Actions (RPA) historically/currently takes greater than 300 days to fill.
            4.2.7.1.2.3. (Added-USAFE) The servicing CPS will provide additional
            information on all the above criteria. However, the approval of an incentive
            should be a carefully used negotiating tool for selecting supervisors. As such, the
            selecting official may choose to offer the potential selectee an incentive that is
            less than what was originally approved or offer nothing at all if the manager does
            not believe it is necessary to offer the incentive to have an applicant accept a job
            offer.
        4.2.7.1.3. (Added-USAFE) . An employee must sign a written Service Agreement
        to complete a specified period of employment. It is USAFE policy for use of
26                                                 AFI36-802_USAFESUP_I 24 JULY 2012


        Recruitment Incentives that Service Agreements will match the employee’s tour
        obligation.
     4.2.7.2. (Added-USAFE) Retention Incentives may be paid when an employee is likely
     to leave for a different Federal position before the closure or relocation of the employee’s
     office, facility, activity or organization, or when the employee is likely to leave the
     Federal service.
        4.2.7.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Retention Incentives may be paid to a current employee
        based on a special need for the employee’s services or unusually high or unique
        qualifications that makes it essential to retain the employee in his or her current
        position.
        4.2.7.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Retention Incentives may only be paid up to 25% of
        employee’s basic rate of pay and if the employee’s current rating of record is at least
        “fully successful” or the equivalent. Groups of employees may receive a Retention
        Incentive of up to 10 percent of basic pay based on high or unique qualifications or a
        special need.
        4.2.7.2.3. (Added-USAFE) Retention Incentives will be extremely limited in
        USAFE and only for critical skills or in certain situations. They will not be solely
        tied to extensions or an employee’s DEROS in order to retain them beyond their tour.
        An example of when a Retention Incentive may be appropriate is if an employee with
        a critical skill set has received a notice of job abolishment and accepts a job
        somewhere else prior to the DEROS. This is called the “jumping ship” syndrome. In
        order to use the Retention Incentive in these cases there must be little, if any,
        likelihood of being able to fill the position (as the approaching abolishment date
        makes it impossible to fill or there is an inability to hire due to undesirability of the
        location/position based on circumstance surrounding the abolishment).
        4.2.7.2.4. (Added-USAFE) The incentive may be paid to a current employee in the
        following situations: 1) who has unusually high or unique qualifications who have
        received an employment offer outside the federal government; 2) the employee has
        received specific written notice their position will be affected by the closure or
        relocation of the office, facility, activity, or 3) the organization/agency has a special
        need for the employee’s service.
        4.2.7.2.5. (Added-USAFE) Due to the rotational nature of overseas tours, Retention
        Incentives will only be used in very rare instances in USAFE. Retention Incentive
        may not be offered for the sole reason of keeping an employee who has reached their
        DEROS and whom management wishes to extend.
        4.2.7.2.6. (Added-USAFE) Retention Incentives may be used if there will be
        closure or relocation of the office, facility, activity, or organization in which an
        employee is located and the employee has specific skills needed to complete the
        closure/relocation. A Retention Incentive will not be paid if there are others with the
        skill set who could accomplish the same mission and there is time to bring on a new
        employee. Only in rare cases will the timeliness of filling a position be a factor in the
        final decision. Additionally, if the required timeframe goes beyond an employee’s
AFI36-802_USAFESUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                         27


          current tour obligation, there must be an approved extension on file before a
          Retention Incentive can be offered.
          4.2.7.2.7. (Added-USAFE) The requirement for Service Agreements vary for
          Retention Incentives. Service Agreements will typically match the date on which the
          employee’s special skills are no longer required or the date position is actually
          affected by a relocation/closure. Service Agreements may not be for less than six
          months nor may they exceed four years.
      4.2.7.3. (Added-USAFE) Relocation Incentives may be paid (up to 25% of the annual
      rate of pay) to entice current Federal employees to positions that would otherwise be
      “hard to fill”. In return, the employee must sign a Service Agreement.
          4.2.7.3.1. (Added-USAFE) A Relocation Incentive may be paid to a current
          employee who relocates to accept a position in a different commuting area.
          4.2.7.3.2. (Added-USAFE) To be eligible an employee must be well qualified and
          their current rating of record must be at least “Fully Successful” or equivalent.
          4.2.7.3.3. (Added-USAFE) A Relocation Incentive may not be paid until the
          employee establishes residence in the geographical area and a Service Agreement is
          signed.
          4.2.7.3.4. (Added-USAFE) An employee must sign a written Service Agreement to
          complete a specified period of employment. It is USAFE policy for use of incentives
          that Service Agreements will match the employee’s tour obligation.
4.3. Request Procedures. Request packages must identify:
   • The employee's pay plan, occupational series, grade, step, and annual salary.
   • The requested percentage with rationale.
   4.3.1. Approving Officials: • May return a package without further action if they
   disapprove a request at any time in the approval process.
   • May not approve a greater bonus or allowance than the coordinating official has
     recommended.
      4.3.1.1. Category I. The career program PALACE team chiefs will prepare the request
      package and send it through AFPC/DPK for review and to HQ USAF/DPCE, 1040 Air
      Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1040. HQ USAF/DPCE will forward package to
      HQ USAF/DPC for coordination. After coordination by HQ USAF/DPC, the package
      will be forwarded to the Career Program Policy Council Chair. If the Chair concurs, the
      package will be returned to the recruiting unit or career program to be included in the
      processing package for the employee. The processing package (personnel actions) will be
      sent to the servicing personnel office for final processing.
      4.3.1.2. Category IIa. The gaining supervisor, with assistance from the servicing
      personnel office:
   • Prepares the request.
   • Sends it to the appropriate career program PALACE Team at AFPC/DPK, 555 E Street
     West, Suite 1, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4530.
 28                                                  AFI36-802_USAFESUP_I 24 JULY 2012


          4.3.1.2.1. The PALACE team:
   • Reviews the package.
   • Sends it along the same path as described in 4.3.1.1.
      4.3.1.3. Category IIb and IIc. The MAJCOM sends the request package to AFDPS,
      1040 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1040.
          4.3.1.3.1. The MAJCOM sends packages for Schedule C employees (GM-15 and
          below) to 11 MSS/DPC, 1460 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1460.
      4.3.1.4. Category III. Process the package in accordance with local procedures.
          4.3.1.4.1. (Added-USAFE) Requests for Category III employees must include all
          requirements under Chapter 4. The request must be submitted up the supervisory
          chain     to    the    Group     Commander/Directorate/equivalent. The    Group
          Commander/Directorate/equivalent will route to the servicing CPS for
          recommendation. The CPS provides a recommendation back to the Group
          Commander/Directorate/equivalent for consideration.       From there the Group
          Commander/Directorate/equivalent will review recommendation and provide
          concurrence/non-concurrence.      If the Group Commander/Directorate/equivalent
          concurs, s/he will route the package to the Installation Commander or Appointing
          Official for final approval. For HQ USAFE and NAF positions, the HQ USAFE/CV
          will decide as the CRCB chair.
              4.3.1.4.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Any management official in the supervisory chain
              may non-concur on the package. If non-concurred by a management official, the
              package is considered disapproved and no further coordination is possible. All
              management officials must approve of the request for continued coordination.
4.4. Case-by-Case Determinations. Decide whether to pay a recruitment or relocation bonus
or a retention allowance on a case-by-case basis. EXCEPTION: A MAJCOM may request a
relocation bonus from the OPM through HQ USAF/DPCE when:
   • Employees are members of a specific group (for example, Office of Special Investigations
     criminal investigators) who are subject to a mobility agreement and a determination is
     made the relocation bonuses are necessary to retain employees.
   • A major organization is relocated to a different commuting area and a determination is
     made the relocation bonuses will keep operations from being interrupted.
4.5. Paying, Reducing, and Discontinuing Recruiting and Relocation Bonuses and
Retention Allowances:
   4.5.1. Recruiting and Relocation Bonuses. Make payments in a lump sum as soon as
   possible after the bonus has been approved and the employee has reported for duty. Payments
   may not be made until after the employee has signed an agreement (see Figure 4.1) to serve
   a minimum of 12 months with the DoD.
      4.5.1.1. (Added-USAFE) For Category III employees, Service Agreements will equal
      time required to complete either an initial or renewal tour length (depending on the
      employee’s personal circumstance) for the assigned duty location. This will ensure
      responsible use of local funds and meet mission needs. USAFE CPSs should recommend
AFI36-802_USAFESUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                              29


       for Category I and IIa that recipients be required to serve a tour or renewal tour
       equivalent (as appropriate).    However, for Category I and II employees, Service
       Agreements will ultimately follow direction provided by approving officials.
       4.5.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Service Agreement lengths of time will be included in
       vacancy announcements so applicants understand/concur upfront.

Figure 4.1. Format for Service Agreement for Recruitment and Relocation Bonuses.

SERVICE AGREEMENT FOR RECRUITMENT AND RELOCATION BONUSES

A. INTRODUCTION. The Air Force has delegated authority to approve a recruitment or
relocation bonus to officials with appointing authority or their designee. The provisions of 5
U.S.C. 5753, subparts A and B, part 575 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, and
Department of Defense (DoD) policies require, as a condition for receiving the bonus, that the
employee sign a written service agreement to complete a minimum of 12 months with the DoD.

B. CONDITIONS OF SERVICE:

1. Employees who accept a recruitment or relocation bonus are required to serve a minimum
of 12 months in the DoD. Failure to meet this requirement will place the employee in debt to the
DoD and he or she will be required to repay the bonus on a pro rata basis. The amount to be
repaid will be determined by providing credit for each full month of employment completed
under the service agreement. Failure to complete the period of employment established under
this service agreement will occur if the employee's service with the DoD is terminated before
completion of the specified period of employment.

2. The bonus shall be calculated as a percentage of the employee's rate of basic pay and will be
paid as a lump sum. Actual payment of the bonus will not occur until the employee has entered
on duty or reported to the new duty location.

3. The bonus is subject to the aggregate limitation on pay prescribed in subpart B, part 530 of
title 5, Code of Federal Regulations. It is also considered to be income for federal income tax
purposes.

C. AGREEMENT. I, (name of employee), have read the preceding paragraphs and understand
that I must complete at least 12 months of service in the Department of Defense as a condition
of my receipt of a (type of bonus) bonus. I further understand failure to complete this period of
service will result in my indebtedness to the federal government and I will be required to repay
the bonus on a pro rata basis. I agree to these terms and accept a (type of bonus) bonus in the
amount of        percent of my basic pay.

Employee (Name)                                      Date

   4.5.2. Retention Allowance. Do not consider retention allowances to be part of basic pay.
   Pay them:
   • In the same manner and at the same time as basic pay.
   • For as long as the conditions require continuing the allowance.
   • After an annual review and recertification, if the allowance continues beyond 12 months.
       4.5.2.1. Reduce or discontinue the allowance at any time when:
   • A lesser amount or no allowance at all would retain the employee.
   • Labor market conditions have changed and you can recruit employees without paying a
     recruitment bonus.
   • The need for the services of the employee have lessened.
   • Budgetary concerns prevent payment.
       4.5.2.2. The service agreement for relocation bonuses runs concurrently with the service
       agreement for a permanent change of station. Failure to complete the service agreement
       will obligate the employee to a pro rata repayment of the bonus.
4.6. Recording Recruitment and Relocation Bonuses and Retention Allowances. Approving
officials are responsible for ensuring the basis for payment of the bonus or allowance is fully
documented. This documentation will be retained in the servicing personnel office.
   4.6.1. (Added-USAFE) Documentation will be scanned and profiled by servicing CPS into
   PARIS Library (or current automated Electronic Personnel File).
4.7. Supervisory Differentials. An official's decision to grant a supervisory differential,
including the amount of the differential, must be reviewed and approved by an official at a
higher organizational level. See table A3.1 for a quick reference on granting supervisory
differentials.
   4.7.1. Officials with delegated review and approval authority may designate subordinates to
   make initial differential decisions, subject to the official's final review and approval.
   Designations must be in writing and be included in local operating instructions.
   4.7.2. Only the Secretary or Deputy Secretary of Defense may approve supervisory
   differentials for individuals appointed to Schedule C positions. Requests for approval of
   supervisory differentials for Schedule C positions will be coordinated through 11 MSS/DPC
   and HQ USAF/DPC prior to submission to DoD.
   4.7.3. Supervisory differentials:
   • May not be paid if the subordinate upon which the differential is based is a foreign national
     (direct or indirect hire) or nonappropriated fund employee.
   • Will be calculated and paid in accordance with 5 CFR 575.405.

   • Will be adjusted and terminated in accordance with 5 CFR 575.406.
   • Will be terminated within 30 calendar days after the subordinate position or positions
     used as the basis for a supervisory differential becomes vacant.

4.8. Documenting and Recording Supervisory Differentials. Approving officials document
the granting of a supervisory differential. Documentation includes:
   • Sufficient information for reconstructing the action.
   • Basis for determining the amount of the differential.
   • The comparison of continuing pay required by 5 CFR 575.405.
   4.8.1. The civilian personnel flight will maintain supervisory differential documentation.

                     SUPERIOR QUALIFICATION APPOINTMENTS

5.1. Introduction. The Delegation Agreement between DoD and OPM, dated 13 Jun 80,
authorized DoD to administer certain authorities previously reserved to OPM. Included under
this agreement is the authority to set advanced in-hire rates based on superior qualifications or
the agency’s need for the candidate’s skill for employees under the General Schedule.
   5.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Decision regarding superior qualifications must be made prior to an
   employee entering on duty.
5.2. Superior Qualification Appointments. The appointing authority or designee is authorized
to approve higher rates of pay for an appointment of a specific individual with superior
qualifications. The recommendation and coordination process is the same as it is for the
recruitment bonus. See table Table A3.1 for a quick reference on approving above minimum
entry rates for superior qualifications.
   5.2.1. Consider the advantages and disadvantages of all pay options when recruiting a
   candidate. Recruiting bonuses will not be used with superior qualification appointments
   unless comparable non-federal salaries justify both payments.
       5.2.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Use of superior qualification appointments and setting pay at
       higher than Step 1 should be used only in rare occasions for those employees who not
       only meet the basic requirements of the program in having superior qualifications, but
       when other candidates cannot fill a specific need and management must entice candidates
       to federal positions.
5.3. Documenting and Recording Superior Qualification Appointments. Approving
officials must fully document superior qualification appointments.
   5.3.1. Documentation includes:
   • A statement of the superior qualifications of the individual or the special need of the
     installation that justifies the appointment.
   • Factors considered in deciding the employee's existing pay and in setting the pay at a higher
     rate than needed to match the individual's existing pay.
   • Reasons for authorizing an advanced rate instead of or in addition to a recruitment bonus.
   5.3.1. (USAFE) Documentation includes:
       5.3.1.1. (Added-USAFE) . The statement of the superior qualifications of the individual
       or the special need of the installation must justify the appointment at a step within the GS
       grade rate range above the first step.
       5.3.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Factors and supporting documentation considered in deciding
       the employee's existing pay and in setting the pay at a higher rate than required to match
       the individual's existing pay i.e., on a comparison of total compensation that the
       candidate is currently receiving, or formerly received and the proposed position as well as
       the unwillingness to accept the job offer at less than advanced pay rate.
AFI36-802_USAFESUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                           33


      5.3.1.3. (Added-USAFE) The success of recent of recent efforts to recruit candidates
      for the same or similar positions.
      5.3.1.4. (Added-USAFE) The use of a Recruitment Incentive must be considered and
      the reasons for authorizing an advanced rate instead of, or in addition to, a recruitment
      bonus must be documented.
   5.3.2. Approving officials make their documents available for review upon request.
      5.3.2.1. (Added-USAFE) All requests must be coordinated through the servicing CPS
      prior to approving official decision. CPS must provide recommendation in relation each
      specific request, in writing, to the approving official regarding use of superior
      qualifications against pay setting guidance.
   5.3.3. When coding superior qualification appointments into the Defense Civilian Personnel
   Data System (DCPDS), use pay rate determinant "5" or "7."

                      STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM.

6.1. (Added-USAFE) Introduction. Student Loan Repayment of federally insured student
loans may be used as a recruitment or Retention Incentive for candidates or current employees if
USAFE, in the absence of the repayment, would otherwise encounter difficulty in filling the
position or retaining the employee.
6.2. (Added-USAFE) Eligibility. This authority applies to employees (as defined by 5 USC
2105) covered under the GS and certain excepted service pay plans. Consider the advantages and
disadvantages of all pay options when obligating funds to repay student loans.
   6.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Approving officials may offer student loan repayments to facilitate
   the recruitment or retention of highly qualified employees who meet the eligibility criteria
   established in 5 CFR 537.104 as follows: Temporary employees who are servicing on an
   appointments leading to conversion to term or permanent appointments; term employees with
   at least 3 years left on their appointment; permanent employees; or, employees servicing on
   excepted appointments with conversion to term, career, or career-conditional appointments
   (including but not limited to, Career Intern or Presidential Management Intern appointments).
       6.2.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Eligibility includes all highly qualified employees regardless
       of job series including Senior Executive Service, Federal Wage System, Defense Civilian
       Intelligence Program, and employees covered by administratively determined pay
       systems unless specifically excluded by law or regulation.
   6.2.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Employees in positions excepted from the competitive civil
   service because of their confidential, policy-determination, policy-making, or policy-
   advocating character, etc. (i.e. Schedule C employees) are not eligible.
       6.2.1.3. (Added-USAFE) Loans eligible for payment are those made, insured, or
       guaranteed under parts B, D, or E of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 or a
       health education assistance loan made or insured under part A of Title VII or part E of
       Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act.
       6.2.1.4. (Added-USAFE) Installations can repay more than one loan as long as the loan
       repayments do not exceed $6,000 per year/$40,000 lifetime limit. Approving officials
       shall not authorize payments to cover accrued penalties or late fees associated with the
       loan(s).
       6.2.1.5. (Added-USAFE) The employee is responsible for continuing to make loan
       payments on the portion of the loan for which s/he is responsible and for any income tax
       obligations resulting from the student loan benefit.
   6.2.2. (Added-USAFE) It is AF policy that Student Loans meeting the eligibility
   requirements may be repaid to the holder of the loan up to $6,000 over a 12 month service
   period for an aggregate limit of not more than $40,000 per employee.
       6.2.2.1. (Added-USAFE) By exception, the aggregate loan repayment may be approved
       above the AF imposed limit of $40,000 up to the statutory $60,000 maximum. Only
AFI36-802_USAFESUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                                35


      installation commanders with appointing authority (or HQ AFPC/CC for centrally funded
      student loan repayments administers by the career programs) may approve exceptions.
      6.2.2.2. (Added-USAFE) A copy of each exception must be forwarded to the owning
      MAJCOM/A1K for information.
6.3. (Added-USAFE) Criteria for student loan repayment plan.
   6.3.1. (Added-USAFE) When used as a recruitment tool, there must be justification that, in
   the absence of offering loan repayment benefits, the installation or organization would have
   difficulty in filling the position with a highly qualified employee. For USAFE, a statement
   will be added to the job announcement when the student loan repayment is authorized.
      6.3.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Determinations for recruitment purposes (including the
      amount to be paid) must be made before the employee enters on duty.
   6.3.2. (Added-USAFE) When used as a retention tool, there must be justification
   addressing the unique qualifications of the employee or special needs of the agency for the
   employee’s services make it essential to retain the employee, and that in the absence of the
   offering student loan repayment benefits, the employee would be likely to leave for the
   employment outside of the Federal service. This determination must be based on a written
   description of the extent to which the employee’s departure would affect the installation’s or
   organization’s ability to carry out an activity or perform a function that is deemed essential to
   its mission.
   6.3.3. (Added-USAFE) When selecting employees to be recipients, approving officials
   must ensure fair and equitable treatment.
      6.3.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Approving officials will determine the amount of the loan
      repayment based on the employee’s value to the activity and budgetary considerations.
      6.3.3.2. (Added-USAFE) Approving officials are responsible for verifying if, and the
      amount, of previous student loan repayments, if any, made by the DoD on the recipient’s
      behalf prior to submitting a student loan for approval.
   6.3.4. (Added-USAFE) For locally funded student loan repayments, management must
   identify (in writing) the basis for each student loan to comply with Office of Personnel
   Management (OPM) regulation 5 CFR 537.105. The requesting official must submit
   documentation (in writing) that includes a statement of the qualifications of the individual or
   the special need of the installation that justifies the repayment of the Student Loan.
      6.3.4.1. (Added-USAFE) Also necessary are factors and supporting documentation
      considered in whether or not to pay. For example, packages may include a comparison of
      total compensation that the candidate will receive for the proposed position as well as the
      candidate’s unwillingness to accept the job offer/or remain in the position without the
      student loan repayment.
      6.3.4.2. (Added-USAFE) The success of recent efforts to recruit candidates for the
      same or similar positions.
      6.3.4.3. (Added-USAFE) Other incentives or flexibilities considered.
      6.3.4.4. (Added-USAFE) All requests must be coordinated thru the servicing CPS prior
      to approving official decision. CPS must provide recommendation in relation each
 36                                                    AFI36-802_USAFESUP_I 24 JULY 2012


       specific request, in writing, to the approving official regarding use of student loan
       repayment against pay setting guidance.
       6.3.4.5. (Added-USAFE) Approving officials must make their documents available for
       review upon request.
6.4. (Added-USAFE) Service Agreement. Prior to the repayment of a student loan the
employee receiving this benefit must sign the AF approved student loan repayment form with a
minimum three year Service Agreement. Where appropriate the approving official may seek an
agreement requiring a period of service beyond the statutory minimum. The Service Agreement
begins on the date stated in the agreement. Approving officials must work with their servicing
CPS to determine the best length of time for a Service Agreement.
   6.4.1. (Added-USAFE) Service Agreement will state the amount of the loan repayment
   authorized for each year of the recipient’s service requirement.
       6.4.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Repayment will be determined solely on the outstanding debt
       at the time the employee and activity enter into an agreement. Individuals who fail to
       complete their agreements must reimburse the Department of Defense (DoD) for the
       entire amount of all benefits. Reimbursements will be restored to the originating account.
       6.4.1.2. (Added-USAFE) The Service Agreement may specify other employment
       conditions for continued authorization. This may include a requirement for the employee
       to perform specific duties, meet all conditions of employment for the position, and/or
       retain employment within the organization. These conditions must be defined on the first
       page of the Service Agreement under “Conditions of Employment”.
   6.4.2. (Added-USAFE) The student loan repayment is in addition to basic pay and any
   other form of compensation payable to the employee.
   6.4.3. (Added-USAFE) The CPS will verify and retain with the Service Agreement proof
   of balance remaining on qualifying outstanding loans when the Service Agreement is made.
   A copy of the completed/signed Service Agreement will be given to the Defense Finance and
   Accounting Service (DFAS) Customer Service Representative (CSR) who will use the
   document to initiate payments to the lender on a biweekly basis.
   6.4.4. (Added-USAFE) An employee must maintain an acceptable level of performance in
   order to continue to receive repayment benefits.
   6.4.5. (Added-USAFE) An employee must reimburse the paying agency for all benefits
   received if he or she is separated voluntarily or separated involuntarily for misconduct,
   unacceptable performance, or a negative suitability determination under 5 CFR 731.
   6.4.6. (Added-USAFE) Factors to Consider. The approving official must consider labor
   market conditions, any special qualifications, skills, or education needed for the position, the
   appropriateness of this incentive in lieu of, or in addition to, other incentives, the availability
   of funds, and the candidates’ grade point average (if attending school), etc.
6.5. (Added-USAFE) Basis for Amount. In determining the size of the loan payments, an
approving official should consider the value of the candidate to the need of the organization and
how far in advance the organization can commit funds. The basis for the amount of the incentive
and service period must be documented.
AFI36-802_USAFESUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                               37


6.6. (Added-USAFE) Combined Usage. This incentive may be used in conjunction with any
other incentive.
6.7. (Added-USAFE) Payment. Payments must be made directly to lenders/note holders,
rather than the employee.
   6.7.1. (Added-USAFE) DFAS will make payments to the lender on a biweekly basis.
   DFAS will determine the amount to be paid by dividing the annual repayment amount by the
   number of pay periods in the year for which payments are made. The loan repayment
   amount will be considered as taxable wages and tax withholding will be made on a biweekly
   basis as appropriate. The employer is not responsible for any late fees or penalties assessed
   by the loan holder(s) prior to, during, or subsequent to this agreement.
6.8. (Added-USAFE) Periods in a Non-Pay Status. Periods of leave without pay (LWOP) or
other periods during which the employee is not in a pay status, do not count toward completion
of the required service period.
   6.8.1. (Added-USAFE) Absence because of uniformed service or compensable injury is
   considered creditable toward the required service period upon reemployment.
   6.8.2. (Added-USAFE) Loan payments will not continue for periods of documented LWOP
   (i.e. personnel action) outside of those listed in 6.8.1. These periods of LWOP will result in
   corresponding loss in loan repayment benefits unless the Service Agreement is extended to
   cover “make-up” payments by the loan approving official.
6.9. (Added-USAFE) Employee Reimbursement. Employees who fail to complete the period
of service specific in the Service Agreement are subject to debt collection processes as outlined
in DoD 700.14-R, DoD Financial Management Regulation, Volume 8.
   6.9.1. (Added-USAFE) Failure to complete the period includes resignation, transfer to a
   non-DoD agency or involuntary separation based on misconduct or performance.
   6.9.2. (Added-USAFE) Transfer to another DoD agency will terminate payments from the
   Air Force but will not relieve the employee from completing the total period of service
   required in their Service Agreement.
   6.9.3. (Added-USAFE) The approving official may waive all or part of a recovery if s/he
   feels the recovery would be against equity and good conscious or against the public interest.
6.10. (Added-USAFE) Documentation. Approving officials are responsible for ensuring the
basis for repaying a student loan is fully documented in accordance with 5 CFR, Part 537.
   6.10.1. (Added-USAFE) The servicing CPS will maintain documentation for each student
   loan repayment to include verification of the employee’s outstanding student loan; the
   manager’s approved justification for authorizing the loan repayment, and a copy of the
   Service Agreement. These records may be destroyed/deleted after 3 years or OPM formally
   evaluates the program, whichever comes first.
   6.10.2. (Added-USAFE) In addition a copy of the Service Agreement will be filed on the
   left-hand side of the employee’s official personnel file and in the supervisor’s work folder for
   the locally approved repayments. The servicing CPS is responsible for profiling the
   information into electronic document library.

6.11. (Added-USAFE) By 15 Oct of each year the servicing CPS must provide the following to
HQ USAFE/A1KKC for that fiscal year: the number of employees selected to receive a student
loan repayment, the job classifications of the employees selected; and, the cost for the benefits
provided.
   6.11.1. (Added-USAFE) By 31 Oct of each year, the MAJCOM will report this information
   to HQ USAFE/A1PC.
6.12. (Added-USAFE) Processing. Processing an approved student loan repayment will be
done in accordance with current AF processes.
AFI36-802_USAFESUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                            39


                                 Chapter 7 (Added-USAFE)

                      PERMANENT CHANGE OF STATION (PCS)

7.1. (Added-USAFE) While PCS costs are not a traditional Recruitment/Retention/Relocation
(“3R”) incentive it is a hiring incentive. PCS funds will only be used to attract candidates to
accept positions in USAFE where the local recruitment pool doesn’t provide the necessary skill
sets.
   7.1.1. (Added-USAFE) In USAFE, PCS costs may come with an additional entitlement to
   Living Quarters Allowance (LQA); therefore, PCSs should be used strategically to fill only
   those positions where there is a requirement to go outside the local commuting area for
   recruitment.
       7.1.2. (Added-USAFE) While PCS costs are a factor, LQA eligibility is made on a
       case-by-case determination using many factors. Refer to CPS overseas benefits and
       entitlements POCs, the Joint Travel Regulations, Vol. II (JTR) and the Department of
       State Standardized Regulations (DSSR), DoDI 1400.25, Vol, 1250, and USAFE
       Instruction 36-705, for additional details and information.
   7.1.3. (Added-USAFE) Employees are not authorized to pay to relocate themselves to
   USAFE. Therefore, any recruitment outside the commuting area must authorize PCS.
7.2. (Added-USAFE) PCS Guiding Principles.
   7.2.1. (Added-USAFE) The JTR implement the Federal Travel Regulation codified in Title
   41 CFR 300-304. In particular, JTR Chapter 5 covers “Permanent Duty Travel” for
   employees and dependents.
   7.2.2. (Added-USAFE) IAW USAFE’s Fiscal Guidance, all PCS costs will to be assigned
   to Program Element (PE) 28561F and include Emergency Support (ESP) Code “PH” for ease
   of headquarters tracking, oversight and consolidated visibility. Starting in FY13, the proper
   Responsibility Center/Cost Center (RCCC) will be XX9040 only. In addition, ensure there
   are no element of expense investment codes (EEIC) 409 costs being incurred for local PCS
   expenses as all travel and transportation costs are covered under EEIC 42100 for local PCS
   moves.
7.3. (Added-USAFE) PCS Requirements.
   7.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Employees' entitlement to return placement at the end of their tour
   is based on their appointment authority and they may only be selected if PCS costs are
   authorized. An example is a Veteran's Employment Opportunity Act (VEOA) candidate
   (even those hired locally) is entitled to return transportation at the end of his/her tour.
   Therefore, to ensure 100% visibility on PCS costs being spent in both current and out-years,
   PCS must be approved prior to selection of these candidates.
   7.3.2. (Added-USAFE) A statement is required in the vacancy announcement if PCS costs
   will be paid. If PCS costs are not authorized by CRCB, a manager may NOT make a
   selection of an employee whose employment would create PCS obligations by default (i.e.
   VEOA, NAF Interchange, etc). As AFPC is required to refer all candidates, it is the
 40                                                  AFI36-802_USAFESUP_I 24 JULY 2012


   responsibility of the CPS to ensure managers/supervisors/leaders understand these unique
   OCONUS limitations.
7.4. (Added-USAFE) Rules of Engagement for US Civilian Locally Funded PCS.
   7.4.1. (Added-USAFE) Prior to the start of the FY, the CPS is responsible for performing
   succession planning and recruitment analysis to determine the number of PCSs required
   during the upcoming FY and providing the data to the local Comptroller Squadron (CPTS) or
   HQ USAFE/FM (for HQ Directorates/NAF). This estimate must count both incoming and
   outgoing PCSs includes each expected/forecasted for that FY. The CPTS/FM will cost out
   the PCSs to do a best/worst/most likely scenario and each wing should include an estimated
   locally funded civilian PCS requirement within PEC 28561F in building their annual
   execution/civilian execution plan (CEP).
   7.4.2. (Added-USAFE) Locally-funded PCS funds are part of the baseline program in the
   annual Execution/CEP. This provides both the responsibility and the flexibility for the
   organizations to manage, prioritize and fund this program. This provides bases the option to
   realign funds to sufficiently fund their PCS program. If unfunded disconnects cause civilian
   recruitment and/or hiring issues, bases should prioritize within the base unfunded
   requirement (UFR) list and communicate those shortfalls through both the A1 (wing CPS to
   USAFE/A1KK) and FM (wing FMA to USAFE/FMAO) functional channels. Elevating
   these funding disconnects will provide the opportunity for USAFE corporate structure
   consideration in the unfunded requirement process.
   7.4.3. (Added-USAFE) Together the CPS and CPTS will brief functional inputs on PCSs
   for the upcoming FY and recommendations to the CRCB Chair for final decision.
      7.4.3.1. (Added-USAFE) The CRCB Chair will approve/disapprove forecasted PCSs at
      the start of the FY during the CRCB. This will save time during the individual
      recruitment process and allow for planning for the entire year (avoiding late FY
      shortfalls) as the CPS will have approved PCSs on file.
      7.4.3.2. (Added-USAFE) CPS will should include impact of recommendations/
      decisions (i.e. “most likely will be able to fill X out of X positions and how that impacts
      missions/employees).
      7.4.3.3. (Added-USAFE) Requests for PCS not brought up during the CRCB must
      follow approved “out-of-cycle” process.
   7.4.4. (Added-USAFE) Locally funded civilian PCS funds are typically managed as an
   organization’s centrally-managed program. However, a base may chose to decentralize
   execution and funds management through the CPS, if desired. In either case, the CPS and
   CPTS must work closely during the execution year to track expenditures against planned
   requirements to ensure program execution is on track compared to the wing CRCB approved
   plan.
   7.4.5. (Added-USAFE) In each CRCB the status of PCSs and PCS funds will be briefed.
   Status will include those forecasted (initially, and any changes), those approved (initially and
   any changes), funds used to date, those forecasted vs. actual needed, trend for the rest of the
   FY, etc). These briefings will ensure all parties understand the needs and status of PCS funds
   throughout the entire FY.
AFI36-802_USAFESUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                          41


     7.4.5.1. (Added-USAFE) If funds are required that cannot be funded locally, the issue
     should be discussed at the CRCB and a plan approved to address. This plan should look
     to rescope requirements, internally realign dollars from other wing priorities, or lastly
     prioritize as unfunded requirement within the wing’s prioritized list.
  7.4.6. (Added-USAFE) CPTS and CPS should ensure CRCB Chair understands once local
  funding options are exhausted an “unfunded requirement” can be submitted for civilian PCS
  funds. Requests are submitted via normal wing unfunded process, reviewed by the HQ
  functional, and prioritized by the USAFE Corporate Structure for funding consideration.

                                          Attachment 1
                                   GLOSSARY OF TERMS

Terms
Administratively Uncontrollable Overtime (AUO)—Administratively uncontrollable overtime
is premium pay paid on an annual basis to an employee in a position in which the hours of duty
cannot be controlled administratively and which requires substantial amounts of irregular or
occasional overtime, with the employee being responsible for recognizing, without supervision,
circumstances which require the employee to remain at work.
Agency—Agency shall mean the Department of the Air Force.
Air Force Repromotion Rule—Repromotion occurs when an employee who was changed to a
lower grade is promoted from that lower grade. Change to lower grade must have been in the
DoD and caused by the employee to transfer with their function or by a reduction in force or
reclassification. Pay is set at the highest of the following rates: Current rate for grade and step
employee held before change to lower grade, GS mandatory promotion rule, top step of grade
employee is being promoted to when the employee’s current rate is more than the top step of the
grade, or a higher rate if employee is entitled to retain such a rate (e.g., pay retention).
Change to Lower Grade (CLG)—For GS, the change of an employee while continuously
employed from (a) one GS grade to a lower GS grade, with or without reduction in pay, or (b) a
higher representative rate in another pay system to a lower representative rate within a GS grade.
For FWS, change of an employee while continuously employed to (a) lower grade under the
same wage schedule, whether in the same or different wage area, or (b) to a job or grade with a
lower representative rate under a different pay system.
Conversion—A conversion occurs when an Air Force employee is given another appointment
(e.g., temporary to career-conditional) without a break in service of more than three calendar
days.
Existing Rate of Pay—The rate received immediately before the effective date of a transfer,
promotion, change to lower grade, within-grade increase, or (for FWS) revision of a wage
schedule.
Federal Wage System (FWS)—The pay system for employees working in trades, crafts, skilled
and unskilled laboring positions. FWS employees are paid on an hourly basis and their pay is
determined by the prevailing rate paid to employees working under similar conditions in the
same local area. Prevailing rate positions are appropriated fund positions composed of a
nonsupervisory grade (WG), leader grade (WL), and a supervisory grade (WS). Nonsupervisory
and leader regular wage schedules have 15 grades and 5 rates of pay. Supervisory regular wage
schedules have 19 grades and 5 rates of pay.
General Schedule (GS)—The pay system for employees who work in positions classified in
administrative, clerical, professional, and technical occupations. The GS is a schedule of annual
rates of basic pay, consisting of 15 grades, designated "GS-01" through "GS-15" with ten rates of
pay for each grade.
Governmentwide FWS Mandatory Promotion Rule—Pay on promotion is set at a rate that
exceeds the FWS employee’s existing scheduled rate of pay by at least four percent of the
AFI36-802_USAFESUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                                43


representative rate of the grade from which the employee is promoted. If the top step of the grade
is exceeded, pay is set at the top step.
Governmentwide GS Mandatory Promotion Rule—Pay on promotion is set at a rate that
exceeds the GS employee’s existing rate of pay by at least two step increases. If the top step of
the grade is exceeded, pay is set at the top step.
GS Maximum Payable Rate—The lowest rate on the current pay scale of the employee’s grade
that is equal to or exceeds his or her highest previous rate.
Head of Agency—Head of agency shall mean the Secretary of the Air Force or his or her
designee.
Highest Previous Rate (HPR)—Highest previous rate must be based on an employee serving
on a regular tour of duty at the higher rate under an appointment not limited to 90 days or less; or
the employee has served at least 90 continuous days under one or more appointments without a
break in service. (NOTE: Establish pay under these conditions with caution. Before setting the
pay, consult 5 CFR 531.203(c) and (d) for GS employees, and OPM Operating Manual - Federal
Wage System, Subchapter 8-3c and “e” for FWS employees. In the Air Force, HPR is not
authorized when it was earned prior to a two-year break in service.)
Locality Pay—Locality-based comparability payments for GS employees. Locality pay is basic
pay only for purposes of retirement (Civil Service Retirement System, Federal Employees
Retirement System, and the Thrift Savings Plan), life insurance, premium pay (including
overtime pay, hazard pay, and standby duty pay), severance pay, and lump-sum payments for
annual leave. Locality pay is not basic pay for within-grade increases, promotions, pay retention,
highest previous rate, recruitment and relocation bonuses, retention allowances, supervisory
differentials, and other payments or benefits calculated as a percentage of basic pay.
Mandatory Restoration—Situation where employee is entitled to be reemployed, and when
reemployed, their employment status must be restored as if they never left federal civilian
employment.
New Appointment—First appointment, regardless of tenure, as an employee of the federal
government or the government of the District of Columbia. This appointment may be temporary
or permanent.
One Cent Rule—The minimum pay raise on promotion from FWS to GS is one cent higher than
the employee’s current rate of pay.
Promotion—For GS, change of an employee while continuously employed from (a) one GS
grade to a higher GS grade, or (b) a lower rate of pay under another pay system to a higher rate
within a GS grade. For FWS, change of an employee while continuously employed (a) to a
higher grade under the same type of wage schedule, whether in the same or a different wage
area, or (b) to a grade in a pay system with a higher representative rate.
Rate of Basic Pay—For GS, rate of pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position
held by an employee before any deductions and exclusive of additional pay of any kind. For
FWS, rate of pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held plus any night and
environmental differential pay.
Reassignment—Change of an employee while continuously employed in the same agency from
one job to another without promotion or change to lower grade.

Reemployment—Employment, including reinstatement or another type of appointment, after a
break in service.
Reinstatement—Reemployment of a former employee based on the employee’s previous career
or career-conditional employment.
Representative Rate—Rate used to determine the nature of job change (promotion, change to
lower grade, reassignment) where different kinds of pay schedules are involved. The
representative rate for GS is step 4; for FWS, step 2.
Servicing Personnel Office—The AFPC, Civilian Personnel Operations, or until servicing is
transitioned to the AFPC, the Civilian Personnel Flight (CPF), test civilian personnel field
operating agencies, or a personnel office of another component servicing Air Force employees.
Special Rate—Used to provide higher pay rates to address recruitment or retention problems
across an occupation resulting from higher non-federal rates, remoteness of location, undesirable
working conditions, or other appropriate circumstances.
Superior Qualifications Appointment—Appointment of a specific individual with superior
qualifications for a position, made at a rate above the minimum rate.
Supervisory Differential—Supervisory differentials may be paid to a GS or GM employee
responsible for providing direct, technical supervision over the work of one or more civilian
employees not covered by the GS or GM system if the continuing pay of one or more of the
subordinates would, in the absence of such a differential, be more than the continuing pay of the
supervisor. Continuing pay is defined in 5 CFR 575.405.
Transfer—Change of an employee, without a break in service from one branch of the federal
government (Executive, Legislative, Judicial) to another, or from one agency to another.
