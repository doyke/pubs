*SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change implements new guidelines that align guidance in AFI 36-2306 with the
revised guidance in DoDI 1322.25, Voluntary Education Programs. The IC establishes
requirements for minimum grade point average (GPA) and number of semester hours Airmen
need to maintain to continue to receive Military Tuition Assistance (TA), clarifies requirements
for TA Base Aero Clubs to receive TA, establishes requirements for using TA for off-duty non-
degree oriented language courses, and provides the new standard for calculating Mil TA for
courses based on clock/contact hours.

                                          OVERVIEW

1.1. Program Description and Purpose. The Voluntary Education Program supports Air Force
(AF) Force Development by maintaining a highly educated force. The program supports off-
duty voluntary education goals for active duty, Air National Guard, and AF Reserve Airmen.
Program results are tracked by the collection of participation rates, educational goal completions,
and testing participation. The program supports recruiting efforts as an enticing benefit program
and supports retention as an in-service benefit. It significantly contributes to occupational
competencies, institutional competencies, special interest needs, and readiness by supporting the
present and anticipated needs of the Air Force.
1.2. Air Force Voluntary Education Mission Statement. The mission of the Air Force
Voluntary Education Program is to provide and fund educational opportunities and services that
enhance professional and personal development during an Airman’s career. The Air Force uses
this program for recruitment and retention as well as readiness. At a minimum, Voluntary
Education Programs include:
   1.2.1. High-quality, academically challenging educational program opportunities, from adult
   education basic skills through graduate level degrees using the DoD Voluntary Education
   Partnership Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with on and off-base schools,
   Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) with schools offering courses/programs on-base, and
   contracts (overseas).
   1.2.2. Funds available to fulfill the Air Force military tuition assistance (Mil TA) program
   IAW DODI 1322.25, Voluntary Education Programs.

   1.2.4. Academic, vocational, technical, and career counseling programs.
   1.2.5. Assessment of Voluntary Education Programs administered on and from military
   installations.
   1.2.6. An automated system for Voluntary Education data and connectivity to related
   automated systems – Air Force Automated Education Management System (AFAEMS).
1.3. Air Force Goals. Ensure all Airmen are informed of educational opportunities and related
financial assistance available while serving on active duty as well as when they transition to
civilian life. This information is intended to help with decisions for their professional and
personal development. Specific objectives are:
   1.3.1. Outreach to all assigned Airmen within first three months of arrival in order to inform
   them of educational opportunities at their current location.
   1.3.2. Outreach to all separating and retiring Airmen in order to inform them of educational
   benefit changes due to departure from active duty.
   1.3.3. Quarterly outreach to the serviced population in order to keep them notified of the
   various Voluntary Education Programs and services available.

7.7. Military Tuition Assistance (Mil TA) Program. Counseling must be conducted prior to
authorization of Mil TA for first time use on a specific education goal. Additional counseling
will be provided to meet specific needs as they arise during an Airman’s progress toward an
education goal. (See Attachment 6)
7.8. Air Force Educational Leave of Absence (AFELA) Program. The AFELA program is
authorized in Title 10, Section 708, for the purpose of permitting an Airman to pursue any
program of education of the Airman’s choosing at any education level. Enlisted Airmen must be
in their second term of enlistment. Officer Airmen must have completed an initial period of
obligated service on active duty. Airmen stationed OCONUS must be within 12 months of
completing their full overseas tour of duty. If authorized an ELA while OCONUS, Airmen must
complete the full overseas duty and a PCS back to a stateside unit prior to beginning the ELA.
The length of the AFELA program may not exceed two calendar years (three years for a program
of education in a health care profession), including term breaks. The Airman must agree to serve
two additional months of obligated active duty service for each month of educational leave of
absence after completion (or termination) of the AFELA, in addition to any other current period
of obligated service. Airmen on AFELA accrue leave and receive basic pay. They are not
eligible to receive BAH and BAS allowance during the period. The AFELA participants may
not use Mil TA. Airmen may either return to duty or take chargeable leave during term breaks in
order to receive BAH/BAS during those times. (See Attachment 8 for further information and
application process.)
   7.8.1. AF/A1PA (via AFPC/DPSIM) has final approval authority.
   7.8.2. AF/A1DL has overall administration responsibility for the Office of the Secretary of
   the Air Force.
   7.8.3. The ETS Chief has administration responsibility at the base level and makes an
   academic evaluation of each AFELA application.
   7.8.4. The appropriate command authority (squadron commander, etc.) must consider if the
   applicant’s duty requirements during the AFELA can be assumed within the organization
   without endangering mission performance, before recommending approval.
   7.8.5. Airmen must ensure they maintain contact with their unit of assignment as well as
   military standards. They must provide end of term grades to the ETS Chief.
   7.8.6. Answers to guidance and procedure questions beyond the information in this AFI
   must be obtained in AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program and from the OPR at AFPC.
7.9. Educational Deferment Program. It is the intent of the AF to support members in
achievement of their personal education goals provided they satisfy their primary duties without
significant impact on "in-turn" assignments. Therefore, at key times in certain educational
programs, members may be authorized deferments for educational reasons, such as whenever the
education program will be completed during the deferment period. Like other deferments,
education deferments may be waived when they do not serve the overall best interest of the AF.
The ETS Chief has the responsibility to review college degree documentation to ensure all
degree requirements are clearly listed, to request deferment through MPS, and to monitor the
progress of members on educational deferments. The Airman has the responsibility to provide
end of term grades to the ETS. An educational deferment may be cancelled when the Airman’s
leadership determines cancellation is necessary in order to meet mission needs. When the
AFI36-2306 13 AUGUST 2010                                                                    29


Airman is not making satisfactory progress, as determined by review of grade reports, the ETS
Chief may cancel an educational deferment after coordination with the member’s commander
and the MPS/AFPC. Airmen assigned to OCONUS locations are ineligible for the Educational
Deferment Program. Additional program details can be found in AFI 36-2110, Assignments.
7.10. AU/A4/6 Non-Resident Programs.
   7.10.1. Advise and enroll enlisted, officer, and civilians in appropriate courses.

incentive open to eligible first-time enlistees having federally-insured student loans.
Participation is restricted to enlisted Airmen who, upon enlistment, have the incentive
documented on AF Form 3008, Supplement to Enlistment Agreement—United States Air Force.
ETS staff document program assistance in AFAEMS. AFPC/DPSIT administers the program
and provides guidance to ETSs.
7.12. National Call to Service (NCS) Program. A recruiting incentive, the NCS promotes
both military service and participation in ―national service‖ programs. NCS enlistees choose one
of four benefits (bonus, student loan repayment, or one of two education assistance programs) at
enlistment. The choice is documented on a DD Form 2863, National Call to Service (NCS)
Election of Options. NCS participants who reenlist or extend the active duty commitment may
become eligible to enroll in a GI Bill. ETS staff provide counseling and document NCS actions
in AFAEMS. Program guidance is contained in MPFM 05-42, 19 Oct 05, (on line at APFC) and
supplemented by AFPC/DPSIT.
7.13. Troops to Teachers Program. The primary function of the program is referral and
placement assistance. DANTES provides assistance to help participants identify employment
opportunities and teacher certification programs. State Support Offices have been established to
assist participants with both certification requirements and employment leads. Applications and
program details are available on the Troops to Teachers page on the DANTES web site.

                      VOLUNTARY EDUCATION PROGRAM PLAN
                    PROGRAM ASSESSMENT AND PLANNING TOOL

A3.1. Overview. Each ETS must have a comprehensive Voluntary Education Program Plan
(VEPP) which is designed to fulfill the mission, objectives and needs of the installation. The
VEPP is reviewed annually and data is maintained for as long as needed. Education program
planning is comprehensive and continuous to assure the effective application of resources for
program modification and improvement. Data collection, analysis, and interpretation are used to
identify and prioritize the educational needs of the installation so that they may be addressed in a
systematic, data-driven manner. The VEPP also supports the Military Installation Voluntary
Education Review (MIVER) Program.
A3.2. Structure of Voluntary Education Program Plan (VEPP). The VEPP has four sections
to organize assessment and planning material. Bases may include additional items or additional
sections for subjects and situations not covered in the basic structure.
   A3.2.1. Section 1. Mission and Objectives
       A3.2.1.1. The statement of mission and objectives is the foundation for the VEPP. All
       programs and services should support the mission and objectives of the Education
       Program and leadership vectors.
       A3.2.1.2. Each of the following requires a statement or short narrative: Air Force
       mission and objectives; MAJCOM mission and objectives; Installation mission and
       objectives; Quality and effectiveness objectives; Leadership support.

   charges for tuition and fees required in similar circumstances of non-Veterans enrolled in the
   same program.
   A9.9.2. Concurrent use of Post-9/11 GI Bill and Military Tuition Assistance (commonly
   called ―Top Up‖). An Airman entitled to basic educational assistance under the Post-9/11 GI
   Bill who is pursuing education or training, may use, at their discretion, Post-9/11 GI Bill
   benefits to meet all or a portion of the charges of the educational institution for the education
   or training that are not paid by military tuition assistance. The DVA administers this portion
   of the Post-9/11 GI Bill Program.

   A9.10.1. An Airman who is eligible for both the Post-9/11 GI Bill and any other DVA

      assistance under MGIB, by reason of an election not to enroll in MGIB; and as of the date
      of the Airman’s election to use Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, meets the requirements for
      entitlement to educational assistance under the Post-9/11 GI Bill; or
AFI36-2306 13 AUGUST 2010                                                                    57


       A9.10.1.7. Is entitled to basic educational assistance under the Post-Vietnam Era
       Veterans Educational Assistance Program (VEAP). Airmen (VEAP-era) who did not
       open VEAP accounts may be eligible for benefits based on qualifying active duty service
       under the Post-9/11 GI Bill; and
       A9.10.1.8. As of the date of the Airman's election to use Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits,

   33) is irrevocable and will be governed by the DVA. This includes Airmen who converted

   A9.10.4. An Airman entitled to educational assistance under the Post-9/11 GI Bill who is
   also eligible for educational assistance under the MGIB, Chapters 31, 32, or 35 of title 38,
   U.S.C., the EATP, MGIB-SR, REAP, or the provisions of the Hostage Relief Act of 1980 (5
   U.S.C. Section 5561, note) may not receive assistance under two or more such programs
   concurrently, but shall elect (in such form and manner as the Secretary of Veterans Affairs
   may prescribe) under which chapter or provisions to receive educational assistance.
A9.11. Cessation of pay reduction under MGIB. Effective as of the first day of the month
beginning on or after the date of an election under paragraph A.10.10.4 above, an Airman having
pay reduced for MGIB enrollment, shall have that pay reduction ceased, and the requirements of
such section shall be deemed no longer applicable to the Airman. Airmen must take action to
have payments stopped once the Certificate of Eligibility is received.
A9.12. Refund of pay reduction under MGIB. An Airman who is described in paragraph
A.10.10., whose pay was reduced due to enrollment in MGIB, will receive a refund of that pay
reduction subject to the following:
   A9.12.1. A full refund for an Airman who used no months of benefit under the MGIB.
   A9.12.2. A refund reduced by a proportion calculated by the number of months of MGIB
   benefits used divided by 36.
   A9.12.3. To receive this refund, Airmen MUST exhaust their total entitlement under the
   Post-9/11 GI Bill. The refund will be added to the monthly stipend allowance paid in the last
   month of eligibility under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Airmen who do not exhaust entitlement
   under the Post-9/11 GI Bill will not receive a refund of the pay reduction. Example: An
   Airman used 25 months of MGIB (Chapter 30), converts to Post-9/11 (Chapter 33), he/she
   has 11 months of remaining benefits under Post-9/11 (Chapter 33). If he/she does not
   exhaust these 11 months of benefits, no refund of the $1,200 will be given.
A9.13. Treatment of Certain Contributions Under MGIB and REAP (commonly called
―Buy-Up‖).
   A9.13.1. Airmen who participated in the Buy-Up provision of MGIB or REAP will not
   receive the Buy-Up amount if they elect to use benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. There is

   A9.13.2. There is no provision to allow for increasing the amount allowed for Post-9/11 GI
   Bill through use of a Buy-Up.
A9.14. MGIB Benefits Exhaustion. Airmen who have exhausted their MGIB benefits can
qualify for an additional 12 months of benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill based on DVA policy.
A9.15. MGIB Conversion. For Airmen eligible for MGIB who make an election to convert to
the Post-9/11 GI Bill, the number of months of entitlement of the Airman to educational
assistance under the Post-9/11 GI Bill shall be the number of months equal to the number of
months of unused entitlement of the Airman under MGIB as of the date of the election. Airmen
are encouraged to assess their educational goals to determine the time they select Post-9/11 GI
Bill benefits. Example: An Airman who used 25 months of MGIB (Chapter 30), converts to
Post-9/11 GI Bill; he/she has 11 months of remaining benefits of Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits.
Alternatively, an Airman with 11 months of MGIB may choose to exhaust those benefits and
then apply for an extra 12 months of benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill.
A9.16. MGIB Conversion - Additional. In addition to the educational benefits previously
described, Airmen who were eligible for benefits under MGIB, MGIB-SR, or REAP, and elect to
use benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, will be eligible to receive benefits for on-the-job
training, apprenticeship training, correspondence courses, flight training, preparatory courses,
and national exams. Airmen in these circumstances will be paid just like they would have been
paid under their ―previous‖ GI Bill program (i.e., money paid to them for tuition, not to the
school), and they will not receive a living allowance and/or money for books. The DVA is the
sole determination authority in such cases.
A9.17. MGIB Kicker Carryover. If eligible for Kickers under MGIB-SR, the member will
remain eligible for the Kicker payment if they elect to use benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill.
Kickers will be paid lump sum each term (e.g., semester, quarter, etc.) and will be prorated based
upon the monthly kicker value that existed at the time of election.
A9.18. Transferability of unused benefits to dependents.
   A9.18.1. Eligibility.
       A9.18.1.1. Any member of the Armed Forces (active duty and/or Selected Reserve) who
       meets Post-9/11 GI Bill eligibility requirements and at the time of the approval of the
       member’s request to transfer entitlement to educational assistance:
       A9.18.1.2. Has at least 6 years of service in the Armed Forces (active duty and/or
