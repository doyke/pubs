1. Sponsor/Supervisor Responsibilities:
     1.1. Sponsors are responsible for the conduct of their dependents and minors left under their
     control for the purpose of supervision (i.e., children spending the night, visiting, etc.).
     Sponsors are responsible for the safety and conduct of their children, regardless of whether or
     not a parent is present. See Attachment 2 for Youth Supervision Guidelines.
     1.2. The Red Cross Baby-Sitting Course (or equivalent) is mandatory for minors between the
     ages of 12 and 17 who desire to supervise/baby sit minors. Restrictions on the number and
     ages of children and the number of hours children can be baby-sat will be in accordance with
     Guam Child Labor Laws and Home Daycare Guidelines.
     1.3. Any individuals caring for other families’ children a total of more than 10 hours a week
     on a regular basis must be licensed to provide care in on-base quarters. See AFI 34-276,
     Family Child Care Programs, for guidelines.

        1.4.1. Develop and provide Home Alone Training for personnel identified in
        Attachment 2.
        1.4.2. Ensure all personnel listed as certified baby sitters through the Youth Center have
        completed training as prescribed in paragraph 2.3.
2. Procedures For Handling Minors:
     2.1. The 36th Mission Support Group Commander (36 MSG/CC) is approval authority for
     extensions of curfew for special occasions or circumstances. Send a copy of the approved
     extension to 36 SFS/S3O, Building 23020, for posting at the Andersen BDOC.
     2.2. Security Forces will contact Family Advocacy for all cases of child neglect/abuse.
     2.3. In accordance with local laws, it is illegal for any person, firm, or corporation to sell, or
     give persons under the age of 18 any tobacco or alcohol products, (i.e. cigarette papers, or
     any items used in the preparation of cigarettes). Further, it is illegal for persons under the
     age of 18 to utilize any tobacco products on Andersen Air Force Base.
     2.4. Security Forces will detain all persons in violation of the curfew or tobacco policy and
     process them at BDOC. Security Forces will release the violator to their sponsor or
     designated guardian. If contact with the sponsor or guardian is not made within a reasonable
     amount of time, they will be released to the respective Commander or First Sergeant. If the
     violator is not military affiliated, Security Forces will contact the Guam Police Department
     for disposition.

judgment and for any incident or mishap (not considered preventable), which occurs.
