                                           Chapter 1

                                      INTRODUCTION

1.1. Purpose. This manual covers high-level capabilities of the Microsoft Office SharePoint
Services applicable on AFSOC SOFNet Portal (SIPRNet), as well as, AFSOC Enterprise
Information Management (EIM) Portal (NIPRNet). It provides specific business rules for Site
Owners and End Users within the command.
1.2. Definition. SharePoint is a United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM)
(SIPRNet) and AF (NIPRNet) initiative and is defined as an electronic workplace:
   1.2.1. All personnel have access to a vast majority of the information they need to do their
   jobs. Air Force professionals can embrace the practice of information sharing as the norm,
   instead of the exception.
   1.2.2. Each element of information is accessible from the single authoritative source for that
   information.
   1.2.3. Provides a powerful reach-back capability to allow forward environments to either
   push or pull documents through SharePoint.
   1.2.4. How to Access:
SIPR Uniform Resource Locator (URL): http://afsofnet.afsoc.af.smil.mil.
NIPR URL: https://eis.afsoc.af.mil.
       1.2.4.1. Can be accessed remotely by using Common Access Card (CAC) with
       Department of Defense (DOD) electronic email (e-mail) certificates from a .mil/.gov
       computer.
       1.2.4.2. External user access solution available:
SIPR URL: http://www.afsoc.af.smil.mil/register
NIPR URL: https://registration.afsoc.af.mil
       1.2.4.3. Anywhere Access Means:
          1.2.4.3.1. SIPRNet. The AFSOC SOFNet Portal users must have an account created
          through the External User process on the ‗socds‘ domain, which includes Hurlburt
          Field and Cannon AFB. Users outside the domain must register for an external user
          account. (Refer to Para 1.2.4.2., External user access solution available)
          1.2.4.3.2. NIPRNet. The AFSOC EIM Portal can be accessed from any computer
          that has the proper DOD certificates loaded with a CAC reader on a .mil/.gov
          computer. Users must have a local account or an account created through the
          External User process on the NIPRNet Hurlburt Field or Cannon domain. (Refer to
          Para 1.2.3.2., External user access solution available)
1.3. Background.
   1.3.1. AFSOC SOFNet Portal (SIPRNet) was established for the purpose of providing
   collaboration support to AF Special Operations Forces (SOF) users both in-garrison and
   forward deployed.
6                                                  AFSOCMAN33-304 17 NOVEMBER 2009


    1.3.2. The AFSOC SOFNet Portal is the target for migration of operations, business, and
    mission processes and enables collaboration with United States Special Operations
    Command (USSOCOM) partners.
       1.3.2.1. Implementation is part of the larger USSOCOM SOF Enterprise Information
       Environment (SIE).
           1.3.2.1.1. External user access solution available. (Refer to Para 1.2.4.2., External
           user access solution available).
    1.3.3. SharePoint is a methodology and a technology to migrate the AFSOC users from the
    chaotic shared file stores to a robust, collaborative environment. No element of information
    should exist in more than one place within the AFSOC Portals. The SharePoint solution
    contains collaboration, knowledge management, document management, and forms
    management technologies within Microsoft Office SharePoint Services® (MOSS) 2007.
    Users should strive to use these new capabilities to minimize duplication of information.
1.4. Scope. This manual shall be applied to all AF military, civilian, and contractor personnel
under contract by DOD who develop, acquire access, deliver, use, operate, or manage AFSOC
Portals, on NIPRNet (unclassified network) or SIPRNet (classified network). If a rule is only
applicable to a specific network, it will be indicated at the beginning of the paragraph or sub-
paragraph. Note: SharePoint is being implemented enterprise-wide—all major commands
(MAJCOMs) are developing SharePoint portals as mandated and governed by Air Force
Network Integration Center (AFNIC), EIM Program Management Office (PMO).
1.5. SharePoint Guidance.
    1.5.1. The capabilities and business rules for operating and using the applications are
    presented in this manual. This manual is managed by HQ AFSOC/A6, Communications and
    Information Directorate.
    1.5.2. This guidance for AFSOC Portal applications could change at any time for any
    number of reasons, including changes in the organization‘s structure, the availability of new
    tools or technologies, release of updated software versions, or the simple consequences of
    learning by doing in the process of deploying and establishing a SharePoint virtual
    environment.
    1.5.3. The paragraphs in this manual spell out the guidance and procedures for various
    aspects of the SharePoint environment. Each rule may be a tactic, a technique, or a
    procedure for handling information and collaboration in SharePoint. Some are there for good
    business sense; some to overcome idiosyncrasies in the software or implementation policies.
    This manual is established to bring discipline to the use of SharePoint as an enterprise tool.
1.6. Assumptions.
    1.6.1. The same rules for proprietary data, Privacy Act information, and storage space still
    apply.
    1.6.2. Paper records will continue to co-exist with electronic records (e-records) for the
    foreseeable future.
AFSOCMAN33-304 17 NOVEMBER 2009                                                                 7


   1.6.3. The integrity of e-records must be maintained throughout their life cycle. Retrieval of
   the information can only be read only once the information (electronic mail (e-mail)
   message, etc.) is made a final record.
   1.6.4. Sufficient computer resources currently exist to effectively and efficiently manage
   AFSOC e-records.
   1.6.5. Records Professional (Functional Area Records Managers, Records Clerk/Custodian)
   will periodically conduct inspections of organization filing practices (regardless of the
   storage media).
   1.6.6. System security is a requirement of every individual. AFSOC will follow AFI 33-200,
   Information Assurance Management, and will not maintain classified information in an
   unclassified environment.
   1.6.7. These manuals assume users have a basic working knowledge of desktop computer
   and office automation (Microsoft Windows®, web browser, MS Outlook®, Word®, Excel®,
   PowerPoint®, Project®, etc.,) software.
   1.6.8. Mission accomplishment depends on protecting data and information from destruction
   as well as safeguarding systems against intrusion and exploitation. All users share
   responsibility for information assurance. Information security is a force protection issue, and
   all users should be extremely vigilant in the use of any form of communications.
   1.6.9. SharePoint is currently NOT a records management solution. Users should continue
   to use the R: Drive to store final records according to the approved file plan. The Air Force
   is currently developing an electronic records management (ERM) solution. Separate
   guidance and an announcement will be disseminated. Note: In preparation for fielding and
   implementation of an enterprise Records Management Application (RMA) component of
   EIM, the Air Force Records Officer is in the process of conducting technical testing/analysis
   and in the near future provide guidance to authorized the use of SharePoint as an Interim
   Records Repository (SPIRR) on NIPRNet and SIPRNet environment.
1.7. Use of this Manual. The table of contents indicates chapter, paragraph, titles, and page
numbers to facilitate location of information. Illustrations, tables, and diagrams, when
applicable, are located throughout the publication to supplement the text material. A listing of
illustrations and a listing of tables indicate the number, titles, and locations. Abbreviations,
phrases, and words which need clarification are spelled out and explained the first time.
   1.7.1. Definitions. The word SHALL and WILL express a provision that is binding. The
   words SHOULD and MAY is used when it is necessary to express non-mandatory
   provisions. WILL may be used to express a mandatory declaration of purpose or when it is
   necessary to express a future requirement.
   1.7.2. Use of Notes. Notes are used to identify an essential operating/support procedure or
   statement that must be highlighted.

                                           Chapter 2

                                             SITES

2.1. Introduction to Sites. Portal information is current, usable information related to ongoing
operations or collaboration efforts. The portals are intended to be a location in which to share
information between directorates or other agencies regarding current events at the command.
Sites provide information management capabilities for specific purposes and scenarios. Sites are
designed to aid in collaboration, providing resources for information management and sharing.
Sites provide all users with the ability to organize information logically into distinct units.
Creating a site using the approved template will provide a clean and standardized collaboration
area that can contain libraries, lists, and web parts. The following paragraphs define the various
types of sites and address information applicable to all sites.
    2.1.1. Site Management.
       2.1.1.1. All sites shall follow the AFSOC approved site template. The look and feel of
       all sites must remain standard across the command. The look and feel includes standard
       colors, fonts, and backgrounds. The approved unit emblem will be located in the space
       provided by the templates and not presented in other locations. Customization on the site
       must remain very minimal and requires HQ AFSOC/A6O approval to avoid any issues
       for migration to future software versions.
       2.1.1.2. Graphics will only be used for navigation and shall be minimal in size (i.e.,
       thumbnail or icon size). No other graphics are allowed to be displayed on any site as part
       of the site layout. The use of other graphics must be approved by HQ AFSOC/A6O.
       This policy is to help reduce bandwidth issues and expedite access.
       2.1.1.3. All sites must have Site Owner, Primary and Alternate, contact information
       located on the Site Information Form located on the bottom of each page—all fields are
       required. The site owners on the site template must be completed for each site.
       2.1.1.4. All organization sites shall be uniform in appearance. Always be consistent on
       the location of web zones. For example, always place the document Libraries together in
       the left or right most web zone to provide a visual cue to the user of where to find and
       upload documents within the site collection. This will significantly reduce user
       frustration.
       2.1.1.5. The site is an effective mechanism for implementing multi-tiered security, with
       each site and subsite acting as a gateway to new information.
       2.1.1.6. Site Owners are limited to the changes permitted for portal themes or styles,
       background colors, borders, and other elements of the page itself. Note: The ‗AFSOC
       Blue‘ theme on SIPRNet is not permitted for administrative pages. This theme is strictly
       limited for use on dashboards pages.
       2.1.1.7. Site Owners will be limited to modifications to their own site collections, and
       may have different privileges on different site collections based on appointment and/or
       designation.
AFSOCMAN33-304 17 NOVEMBER 2009                                                                  9


     2.1.1.8. Site Owners must contact HQ AFSOC/A6 SharePoint Administrator prior to
     uploading over 1 gigabyte of information to the site. AFSOC Enterprise Information
     Services (EIS) Admin: afsoc.eis@hurlburt.af.mil.
     2.1.1.9. Information must be organized in a defined, structured manner. Information
     should be maintained in one location, primarily within the Office of Primary
     Responsibility (OPR). If that information is needed for reference by a different group of
     users, a link to the home site for that information can be created on a site to point users to
     the appropriate location.
  2.1.2. Site Quotas and Top Level Sites.
     2.1.2.1. The site quota is assigned and managed at the system administrative level. Each
     site will have different needs; all sites will be setup with an initial allocation space of 5
     gigabytes. As the site grows, the Site Owner may submit a request for increase. HQ
     AFSOC/A6O will evaluate and determine the capability to support the request provided
     immediate resources are available.
     2.1.2.2. If the site collection approaches the quota limit, the AFSOC Portals Team will
     receive an automated email notification when a site collection has reached 80% capacity.
     At that time, the AFSOC Portals Team will increase the site collection.
     2.1.2.3. Site quota allocation means that a top level site shares its quota with all of the
     sites within its collection. If a new subsite collection is needed, Site Owners should
     consider the space requirements for the new site before creating it, and if necessary,
     request an increase in the site quota or determine if the site should be create in another
     location.
  2.1.3. Site Maintenance. Site Owners should conduct periodic review and clean up of their
  respective sites and workspaces. Ensure the sites and workspaces follow the guidelines
  established in this guide. A Site Review link is located at the bottom of each site and should
  be annotated upon completion. It is recommended that a review is conducted every 180
  days. Most importantly, duplicate files and unnecessary working documents need to be
  managed based on the Records Management lifecycle. Site Owners and Records
  Professionals should team up in this effort to maintain document integrity and records
  management. Documents within the completed or finished project site must be managed in
  accordance with the records management disposition.
  2.1.4. Recycle Bin. SharePoint Recycle Bin(s) will be automatically cleared after 30 days.
  2.1.5. Site Collection Request Procedures.
     2.1.5.1. AFSOC Portals:
         2.1.5.1.1. Organization and Team Top Level Sites: The AFSOC Portals Team is
         responsible for creating the Top Level Organization or Team Sites. If a site is
         required, use the Top Level Site collection request link available on the Site Owner‘s
         Support site. Only Top Level Site Owners can submit this request.
         2.1.5.1.2. Organization Subsites: Top Level Site Owners are responsible for creating
         Organization Subsites. If justified by organization needs, Division, Branch, or Flight
         Chiefs requiring subsites should send their request to the Top Level (2 letter
         organization) Site Owners.
10                                                   AFSOCMAN33-304 17 NOVEMBER 2009


            2.1.5.1.3. Team or Project Top Level sites: Team Leads requiring Top Level Team
            or Project site s should use the Top Level site collection request link available on the
            Site Owner‘s Support site. The Team or Project site Lead shall appoint Primary and
            Alternate Site Owners for the Team Site.
            2.1.5.1.4. See Top Level and Subsite Owner listing of roles and responsibilities in
            paragraph 2.7.
2.2. Top Level Organization site.
     2.2.1. Audience/Purpose. The Top Level site is open to all authenticated users of the
     system. Top Level Organization sites should be used to communicate and share information
     about a specific organization or office across the enterprise. Each Directorate or
     Organization must appoint a Top Level Site Owners, primary and at least two alternates. For
     HQs Top Level Site Owners, submit appointment letters to HQ AFSOC/A6OK. At the Wing
     level, submit top level appointment letters to 1 Special Operations Communicatons Squadron
     (SOCS) or 27 SOCS, respectively. All SOG‘s Top Level Site Owners appointment letters
     must also be submitted to HQ AFSOC/A6OK. Top Level sites consist of two letter, Wing,
     Group, Squadron, and functional centers, (i.e. Network Control Center (NCC), Mobility
     Operations Command (MOC), Air Operations Command (AOC)).
2.3. Organization Subsite.
     2.3.1. Audience/Purpose. Organization Subsites are open for read access to all authenticated
     users of the system. Restrictions can be applied based on the organization‘s need as they
     deem necessary. Contact Top Level and Subsite Owners for permission and access.
     2.3.2. Implementation. Organization Subsites can be built for each letter organization as
     needed and required; however, the sites should be maintained at the highest level possible to
     prevent duplication of content. A subsite should be nested under its Top Level Organization
     Site to maintain a consistent structure.
2.4. Team Site. Top Level Team Sites are also known as ‗Community Sites‘ in other
MAJCOM portals. To be consistent with AFSOC SIPRNet Portal, the term ―Team Sites‖ will be
referenced throughout this guidance and program implementation.
     2.4.1. Audience/Purpose. A Top Level Team Site is developed to accommodate project
     collaboration for multiple users across multiple organizations. Top Level Team/Project sites
     allow for permissions to be granted to users across multiple organizations without modifying
     the permissions of the Organization site. Projects are considered anything that is not directly
     related to the overall daily business of an organization.
     2.4.2. Implementation. Top Level Team Sites should not be nested under an Organization
     site. Building the site parallel to the organization ensures the Project site is not affected
     during a re-organization. New Team Sites will be requested through the business process
     cycle as a new requirement. See references from the User Support site on how to make the
     request.
     2.4.3. Recommendations. Project/Team Lead and/or Site Owners can add helpful links for
     that activity on the Team Site. Encourage all members with elevated permission within the
     site to attend SharePoint training.
2.5. My Site.
AFSOCMAN33-304 17 NOVEMBER 2009                                                                11


   2.5.1. Audience/Purpose. A personal site maintained by each individual user. My Site
   contains a public area called My Profile and a private area called My Home. Public
   information is accessible to all authenticated users. Private information is accessible to the
   individual and any other users they grant permissions.
   2.5.2. Implementation. No collaborative work should be created, stored, or drafted on a My
   Site. Use Organization site or Team Site for collaboration. Not appropriate for unofficial
   personal information. The intent of using My Site is to replace U: Drive (official-personal)
   in the near future.
   2.5.3. Recommendations. Add frequently used links to the My Links in My Site. These
   should include all Team/Project sites and other MAJCOM sites. Training certificates, travel
   documents, and other official personal related electronic information can be stored in My
   Site.
2.6. Information for All sites.
   2.6.1. Site Owners are responsible for the creation and the assignment of permissions of
   subsites within Organization and Team Site collections.
   2.6.2. Only use the Quick Launch Bar for List or Libraries that are high visibility to the

   appearance (layout) and web parts that are being displayed according to this guide. All Site
   Owners shall follow these guidelines when making changes to a site.
   2.6.6. Mandatory web parts for each Site Collection.
       2.6.6.1. In addition to the site information link at the bottom of each page, a Site Owners
       Contact information web part must be included in each site located on the top right hand
       corner.
       2.6.6.2. Subsite navigation web part will be a listing of all Subsites on the template and
       must be included on every organization page for easy navigation.
   2.6.7. The SharePoint Portals (both NIPRNet and SIPRNet) places the management of
   content firmly in the hands of all users and not just Site Owners, giving them direct access to
   the changes that are made to site content. The portal concept of users as the content
   managers is a privilege that gives users flexibility to create new information and manage that
   information as they see fit.
   2.6.8. Each wing shall assign a designated representative to attend the AFSOC monthly Site
   Owner meeting. 27 Special Operations Wing (SOW), 352 Special Operations Group (SOG),

     turn, hold a monthly Site Owner meeting to disseminate information, policies, and guidance
     received from the AFSOC Portals Team. Note: Meeting minutes will be posted on the Site
     Owners Team Site (SIPRNet).
     2.6.9. Organization sites and Subsites are created in a standard format for directorates,
     divisions, branches, wings, groups, or squadrons etc. Team or Project Sites can be a standard
     integrated process team (IPT) (for example Air Force Network Operations (AFNETOPS)
     IPT) or event which is used for non-IPT Teams (for example, Combined Federal Campaign
     (CFC), AF Climate Survey) formed to solve problems or run projects.
     2.6.10. Organization sites. Organization sites have a Top Level or Subsite at which the
     organization‘s overarching (internal) level of business is accomplished.
     2.6.11. Team Sites. Team Leads and assistant Leads are normally the Primary and Alternate
     Team Site Owners and have all privileges and full control permissions. They can also
     change site and permission settings and are responsible for building the site membership and
     granting site access. See site Collection Request for creation of Team Site on the User
     Support site.
        2.6.11.1. Before creating a Team Site, use the search capability to avoid duplication of
        Team Sites requested and/or created.
        2.6.11.2. Top Level Team Sites shall only be created by portal administrators upon
        request and require approval by HQ AFSOC/A6OK. Top Level Team Sites will not
        count against an organization‘s quota.
        2.6.11.3. Team Sites that will be short in duration and/or only accessible by one
        organization should be created under the respective Organization site, but still utilize the
        Team Site template.
        2.6.11.4. When creating an Organization Team Site, use the Team template: Name the
        site, create any Document Libraries that are relevant to the operation of the IPT, and
        organize information/data in the most sensible and simplistic manner possible.
        2.6.11.5. Inherit permission (or break parent permission as applicable) and then enable
        customized permissions if needed to lockdown access due to proprietary, Scientific and
        Technical Information (STINFO), Privacy Act or other information security reasons.
     2.6.12. Site Owners or designated personnel with elevated permissions at each level have the
     right to add folders to the Document Library for organizational needs not accommodated by
     any published templates.
2.7. Responsibilities.
     2.7.1. Site Owners. Top Level Site Owners will be Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC)

                                              Chapter 3

                                      ANNOUNCEMENTS

3.1. Introduction to Announcements.
     3.1.1. Announcements List provides a place to post information for all site members to
     access. Announcements should be defined as:
        3.1.1.1. A formal public statement.
        3.1.1.2. A broadcast message (i.e., weather warning, gate/office closing, policy notice,
        luncheons).
3.2. Announcement Posting Process.
     3.2.1. Announcements should be captured at the highest applicable level. This prevents
     repetition of the Announcement on Organization Subsites.
     3.2.2. Site Owners should enable content approval on announcements lists if they want to
     control the announcements that are visible on the site. This is recommended for Top Level
     Organization or Team Sites to allow all users to create announcements, but requires Site
     Owners to approve them before being posted. Subsites allow all site members to post
     Announcements without approval to increase collaboration and information sharing.
     3.2.3. New Announcements will be set by default to expire after a specified period of time,
     ensuring continuous posting of new Announcements. Exceptions can be made for special
     Announcements. Exceptions would be applicable for Announcements where the end time is
     not foreseen, such as extensive construction or gate closures.
     3.2.4. Announcements should be restricted to official business.
3.3. Version Settings for Announcements.
     3.3.1. Content Approval. Require content approval for submitted items.
        3.3.1.1. Default: No.
        3.3.1.2. Recommend: Yes. Top Level Organization Sites. Allows Site Owners and
        other specified users to control which items are appropriate events. Organization Subsites
        and Team Sites can allow all site members to post content, to reduce administrative
        workloads.
     3.3.2. Item Version History. Creates a version each time edits are made to an item.
        3.3.2.1. Default Value: No.
        3.3.2.2. Recommend: No. The content of Announcements does not change enough to
        store multiple versions of the Announcement. Versioning should be used when the item
        may need to be restored at a given period in time, such as in a Document Library.
     3.3.3. Draft Item Security. Who should see draft items in this List?
        3.3.3.1. Default Value: Only users who can approve items (and the author of the item).
AFSOCMAN33-304 17 NOVEMBER 2009                                                               17

       3.4.2.2. Recommend: Enabled. Set to Disable to restrict users from adding attachments.
   3.4.3. Folders. Display New Folder option on the New menu.
       3.4.3.1. Default Value: No.
       3.4.3.2. Recommend: No. Folder structure use should be minimized and must be
       approved by respective Site Owner. Site Owners will be the only users who will have the
       ability to create Folders.

                                           CALENDARS

4.1. Introduction to Calendars. The Calendar List provides a place to post event type
information for all site members to access. Events should be defined as:
     4.1.1. Something that happens at a given place and time.
     4.1.2. An occurrence or happening, usually significant to the performance of a function,
     operation or task.

                                         CUSTOM LISTS

5.1. Introduction to Custom Lists. Custom lists are any type of list used for a specific Air
Force business process, beyond what the portal templates provide.
5.2. Business Rules.
     5.2.1. Minimize any duplication of work by not repeating information on multiple lists.
     Refer to the template Gallery for list templates.
     5.2.2. Lists should be maintained at the highest level appropriate to share information.

          or supporting documents: No.
          6.2.1.2.2. If the Document Library is functioning as a final storage place for
          documents, where modifications to documents are NOT allowed: Yes. (This will
          prevent users from uploading copies of a document that have not been properly
          finalized.)
   6.2.2. Item Version History. Creates a version each time an edit is made to an item.
      6.2.2.1. Default Value: No.
      6.2.2.2. Mandatory: Yes. 5 Major Versions. 10 Minor Versions. This ensures that a
      copy of each version of a document is retained for management purposes. If the review
      process requires more than 10 minor versions, configure site settings as appropriate.
      After the final version is created, delete all previous versions if not required by law.
   6.2.3. Require Check Out/In. Require documents to be Checked Out before they can be
   edited.
      6.2.3.1. Default Value: No.

     6.5.1. Documents should be moved to R: Drive based on RDS disposition. Last modified
     date should not exceed 180 days – less than 180 days should be considered working status
     and can remain in the Document Library.
     6.5.2. Exceptions can be made for those documents that are infrequently modified, but are
     still working documents.
6.6. Document Library and Folder Creation Business Rules.
     6.6.1. SharePoint organizes information in Document Libraries. These Libraries allow users
     to create Folders that store information in an efficient and effective manner. Document
     Library headings are the first level of information seen when accessing the SharePoint site.
     These headings should be broad and encompass the purpose of the respective SharePoint site.
     As team members become familiar with this methodology they will approach the site with
     best practices as well as their audience in mind. If Document Libraries clearly reflect the
     specified purpose team members are more likely to use it effectively.
     6.6.2. Site Owners and Record Professionals in the directorate should create Custom
     columns to categorize documents and organize Folders in a Document Library. This is the
     most appropriate way to organize information and effectively supports display options and
     search capability.
     6.6.3. Users should utilize the Document Library features to maximize proper sorting of data
     as well as enhancing search capability. If, however, Folders are required due to mission and
     organization needs, the following business rules shall apply:
        6.6.3.1. Folders within a Document Library shall identify categories of information and
        shall not be named after any specific file in the respective Folder. Folders shall not be
        nested (i.e., Subfolders inside Folders) more than three deep to supplement ease of
        locating working documents.
        6.6.3.2. Users should use short distinct Folder names. These rules prevent proliferation
        of duplicate data while mitigating the potential for lost/hard-to-find files.
     6.6.4. Document Libraries should be utilized for storing working documents for
     collaboration with other users. (Restrictions on permission can be imposed based on
     document Owner‘s request).
     6.6.5. Users should utilize the Breadcrumb Trail shown near the top of page when creating
     sub Folders within a Document Library. Use the links in the Breadcrumb Trail to navigate
     from the current Folder up through the Folder hierarchy within the Library. These allow
     pages to refresh while using the basic back button may not cause updates/changes to appear.
     6.6.6. In addition to document and Folder business rules, proper naming conventions are
     critical for locating and identifying needed documents or other data. Refer to Chapter 11,
     Naming Conventions.
AFSOCMAN33-304 17 NOVEMBER 2009                                                              25


  6.6.7. To ensure Libraries and Folders are serving an efficient and effective purpose, the
  naming convention and organization of these Libraries and Folders should be simplistic and
  consistent throughout the site collection. Users can also file by:
     6.6.7.1. Objectives.
     6.6.7.2. Target Audience.
     6.6.7.3. Types of Projects or Functions.
  6.6.8. To enforce proper use of Document Libraries a description of the expected content
  shall be entered into the description field for that respective Library. This enables users to
  confirm what should be filed in the respective Document Library, while avoiding potential
  confusion.

                                           Chapter 7

                                DOCUMENT WORKSPACES

7.1. Introduction to Document Workspaces. Document Workspaces should be used to
facilitate the creation of documents. The Document Workspace provides the capabilities needed
to allow multiple users to collaborate in the coordination, development and management of
documents; prior to publishing to an Organization Site as a final document for review; prior to
becoming a record. (Refer to Para 2.1.3., Site Maintenance)
7.2. Implementation.
     7.2.1. Document Workspaces can be created by those with appropriate permissions, once the
     document has been uploaded to a Library within SharePoint. In order to create a Document
     Workspace, a user must have permissions or be included in a specially configured Group
     allowing the creation of the Workspace. As the creator of the Workspace, the user has full
     administrative rights to the Workspace and can grant permissions to others for collaboration
     purposes.
     7.2.2. Document Workspaces are extremely useful for document collaboration with
     personnel outside of the organization, as the owner can assign permissions to all users
     without affecting the permissions of the Organization Site.
     7.2.3. Document Workspaces are meant to be temporary sites to support the generation,
     collaboration, and coordination of documents. Once the document coordination has been
     completed and the reference documents are no longer required, this Workspace shall be
     deleted if there is no further value associated with it in accordance with the Records
     Disposition Schedule (RDS).
     7.2.4. Document Workspaces can be created through either the SharePoint interface or
     through several of the Office Suite products (MS Excel®, MS PowerPoint®, MS Word®
     etc.). A Workspace can be created to support the collaboration and coordination of a new
     document or a previously generated document already residing in a Document Library.
     7.2.5. This manual assumes users have a basic working knowledge of the standard desktop
     configuration. Versioning settings should be turned on as previously outlined.
     7.2.6. If a small Group of users (≥5) are involved in a collaboration based on a short term
     task (30 days), use the Document Library within the Organization Sites and apply appropriate
     permission. Otherwise, use the Document Workspace and its features for document
     collaboration to meet organization needs. The Document Workspace Team Lead will be
     responsible for the site maintenance (Refer to Para 2.1.3.)
7.3. Document Creation.
     7.3.1. Create only one copy of each document and maintain it on the Organization or Team
     Site for which it was produced.
     7.3.2. Users can upload a copy of publications, forms and final records (read only copy)
     from the AF Publishing site and R: Drive, respectively, to the Team Site or Workspace that
     requires these copies of documents for a specific Project or Team collaboration. (Refer to
     AFI 33-360, Para 2.2.)
AFSOCMAN33-304 17 NOVEMBER 2009                                                                 27


   7.3.3. Documents should follow the records disposition by fiscal or calendar year and should
   be moved to the R: Drive or disposed of according to the RDS.
   7.3.4. Digitize existing paper documents and upload them in SharePoint only when the
   documents are required for collaboration.
   7.3.5. If required by AFI, maintain all signed paper copies with the official paper file plan or
   if allowed by AFI, digitize the signed document and file in the R: Drive. Store the unsigned
   electronic copy in SharePoint and keep it in the proper Folder on the SharePoint site if
   needed as a template.
   7.3.6. Users should use the search capability before creating any documents to avoid
   duplications.
   7.3.7. Users should check out document before editing, use the tracking capabilities to show
   how the document was changed, and check in documents after editing.
7.4. Saving E-mail to the AFSOC Portals.
   7.4.1. Like any other document, e-mail can be considered working documents. Save e-mail
   as necessary for collaboration, retrieval and eventually marking as record and moved to R:
   Drive. An e-mail message should be saved in SharePoint when it meets the following
   criteria:
       7.4.1.1. Relates to a Team or Project.
       7.4.1.2. Relates to a Task.
       7.4.1.3. Research.
       7.4.1.4. Needs to be shared or required for collaboration.
   7.4.2. Save the e-mail in its native format (i.e., .msg). This preserves message metadata
   (who sent the message, when it was sent) and ensures that the message is displayed
   automatically when read, replied to or forwarded.
7.5. Document Properties and Metadata. Applying document metadata and topics prevent the
document creator from having to worry about where the document is stored—metadata or
specific fields of information can be stored with the document and used for information such as
title, subject, and author. Because the fields are searchable, a document can be easily found
regardless of what folder it is in. Because of the latest Electronic Discovery Rules (EDR)
guidance on draft records, using metadata on daily documents will help users manage draft
documents. Three metadata items are required to be filled in when creating new documents.
The Title, Subject, and Author are mandatory fields under the old file properties-summary
information under Microsoft Office Tools. In SharePoint, the metadata supports a more robust
search capability.
   7.5.1. As a minimum, all official records will be required to have a security classification
   metadata (unclassified (UNCLAS), FOUO, Confidential, and Secret). A separate electronic
   records management (ERM) manual will address the requirements in managing official
   records using AFSOC SOFNET Portal.

     7.5.2. How to prevent a document from being searchable. From the content page toolbar,
     select ‗Settings‘ > (Document Library or List) Settings > Advanced Settings > “Allow items
     from this document library to appear in search results?”

                                          Chapter 8

                                MEETING WORKSPACES

8.1. Introduction to Meeting Workspaces.
   8.1.1. Meeting Workspaces provide for the ability to organize meeting materials, to facilitate
   meeting planning and provide for post meeting action item tracking. The Meeting
   Workspace is meant to provide organizers and attendees a place to post and share project
   files and collaborate, in addition to serving as a virtual meeting environment.
   8.1.2. Meeting Workspaces provide a standardized template for meeting organizers to share
   and post meeting information in order for meetings to be productive and accomplish their
   function. The Meeting Workspace is a valuable site for setting up single meetings and
   reoccurring meetings. Allows users to keep all documents associated with a meeting in one
   location and mitigates the need to e-mail large attachments, agendas, etc.
8.2. Implementation.
   8.2.1. All meetings requiring agendas, attachments, a List of attendees, minutes, etc., will
   use the Meeting Workspace feature in SharePoint. A meeting that requires no documentation
   or those meetings requiring only one or two participants do not require use of the SharePoint
   Meeting Workspace feature. Some example scenarios are provided below. Examples:
   Integrated Planning/Product Team (IPT) meeting, staff meeting, technical exchange,
   demonstration of capability, status meeting like a Program Management Review (PMR), etc.
   8.2.2. Create a Meeting Workspace at the level that makes most sense for the organization
   and functional area.
   8.2.3. Best Practice: Create a Meeting Workspace starting from MS Outlook Calendar. A
   Meeting Workspace created from MS Outlook will automatically sync with SharePoint. The
   Meeting Workspace can be populated with attributes such as attendee List and acceptance
   tracking.
8.3. Procedures.
   8.3.1. Setup a Meeting Workspace feature as follows:
      8.3.1.1. From Outlook Calendar, double click on the time and date to bring up an
      appointment invitation.
      8.3.1.2. Complete fields, invite Workspace members, and assign any other necessary
      information, etc.
      8.3.1.3. Click on ‗Meeting Workspace‘ located in the middle line. This will prompt the
      SharePoint connection.
      8.3.1.4. Navigate to the location selected to host the Meeting Workspace. Choose a
      template based on the meeting type. A List of meeting types is shown below in Table
      8.1.
      8.3.1.5. Click create. A link to the Workspace is automatically created and put in the
      body of the meeting invitation. Before sending the meeting invite, set up the site and add
30                                                  AFSOCMAN33-304 17 NOVEMBER 2009


         the agenda, shared documents, etc. Or simply click send and fill in the details at some
         later date.

Table 8.1. Meeting Workspace Types.
                   Used most of the time for most meetings. Template includes all the basics to
 Basic             plan, organize, and track a meeting. The template contains the following lists
                   and their associated web parts: Objectives, Attendees, and Agenda.
                   One time meeting where decisions are expected to be made by upper
                   management. This template includes features for reviewing documents and
 Decision          recording decisions reached at the meeting. The template contains the
                   following lists, library, and their associated web parts: Objectives, Attendees,
                   Agenda, Document Library, Tasks, and Decisions.
                   Promotions, Retirements, etc. This template supports the planning of social
                   occasions. It features a discussion board and a picture library to post pictures
                   of the event. The template contains the following lists, library, and their
 Social            associated web parts: Attendees, Directions, Things To Bring, Discussions,
                   and Picture Library (Official promotion or retirement pictures). Note:
                   Pictures should be removed after 30 days. This counts against storage
                   allocation.
                   Shows different aspects of the meeting content – need lots of space hence the
                   multiple pages. Rarely needed. All the basics to plan, organize, and track a
                   meeting with multiple pages. This Meeting Workspace contains the
 Multi-page
                   following lists and their associated web parts: Objectives, Attendees, and
                   Agenda. It also contains two blank pages for customizing based on
                   requirements.

                                          Chapter 9

                                       PERMISSIONS

9.1. Introduction to Permissions.
   9.1.1. Management of the security for a site is the responsibility of the Site Owner at all
   levels. The Site Owner is responsible for assigning rights to users within their site. Rights
   will be assigned directly to an active directory (AD) user or Group, or they can be assigned
   through a SharePoint Group containing AD users or Groups.
   9.1.2. Use default Groups to maintain consistency across SharePoint. Using AD Security
   Groups ensures permissions are up-to-date as personnel arrive, change, or leave. The default
   groups are Visitors, Members, and Site Owners.
   9.1.3. The general guidance is to keep open read access to all as much as possible.
   Remember to RESTRICT any areas with Privacy Act information to only those authorized or
   with a need to know. Note: Users that are added to AD Security Groups will inherit the
   permissions of all other Groups nested within that Group.
9.2. Implementation.
   9.2.1. Site Owners: Site Owners have full control of the site, which allows them to add, edit,
   approve/reject or delete content. Modify site layouts and alter permissions settings in
   accordance with this guide.
   9.2.2. Site Members: Allows users to add and/or edit content on a given site.
   9.2.3. Site Visitor: Personnel with read only access; cannot contribute to the content of the
   site.
   9.2.4. Site Owners should enable membership requests to maintain a consistent and
   controlled level of site security in most cases.
   9.2.5. Advanced Permissions settings allow Site Owners to create unique site permissions.
   9.2.6. Stop inheriting permissions: Allows Site Owners to create unique permissions for a
   given site. This option should be used when Site Owners want to give user permissions
   different from those assigned on the parent site. This option is more applicable to Team
   Sites, where users are likely to be from multiple organizations.
9.3. User Access.
   9.3.1. AFSOC SOFNet Portal (SIPRNet).
       9.3.1.1. All Authenticated Users: Any user connected to the socds.smil.mil domain is
       considered to be an authenticated user. Another way to explain this is any SOF user with
       a windows account in USSOCOM Active Directory can access the portal. If a user is an
       authenticated user, Site Owners can give the user access to a collaboration site. Site
       Owners can grant access based on AD Groups. Rather than granting each user access to
       the site, Site Owners can grant access to the entire AD Group. This is beneficial when
       managing permissions in a site. As members of the AD Group change, the rights to the
       site will be enforced based on AD Group membership; this limits the amount of
32                                                 AFSOCMAN33-304 17 NOVEMBER 2009


        administration necessary. All authenticated users will have READ access to AFSOC
        SOFNet Portal unless default parent permissions are broken. Examples: AFSOC
        domain, USSOCOM domain, etc.
           9.3.1.1.1. As currently assigned to Hurlburt, when TDY, login with
           domain\username and password (username must be prefixed with user‘s domain and
           a backslash). Example: AFSOC\username and password.
        9.3.1.2. External Users: Any users outside of the socds.smil.mil domain. An external
        user access solution is available to grant external users access through the AFSOC
        SIPRNet Portal page, www.afsoc.af.smil.mil. Examples: Users at Mildenhall AFB,
        Kadena AFB, Pentagon, Guard/Reserve Units.
        9.3.1.3. All Site Owners (Top Level, Subsite and Team Sites) must complete a sponsor
        application. A sponsor Group should already be established for each Directorate. If not,
        only one sponsor Group should be created per directorate. Members of the sponsor group
        are responsible for granting external access to users in their site.
        9.3.1.4. Sponsorship URL:
https://eis.afsoc.af.mil/sites/usersupport/Lists/Sponsor%20Registration/AllItems.aspx.
     9.3.2. AFSOC Enterprise Information Management (EIM) Portal (NIPRNet).
        9.3.2.1. All Hurlburt users with valid CAC and DOD certificates can access the EIM
        portal from a .mil network regardless of location as long as the user‘s personal computer
        (PC) has a CAC reader.
        9.3.2.2. External Users: All users outside of the Hurlburt domain will require an external
        user account and can be granted access provided they have valid CAC with DOD
        certificates. https://registration.afsoc.af.mil.
        9.3.2.3. TDY Location: Current solution is to Virtual Private Network (VPN) back to
        home base and access site with a CAC.
        9.3.2.4. Anywhere Access. The AFSOC EIM Portal can be accessed from any .mil/.gov
        computer with proper CAC DOD certificates. Users must present a valid DOD CAC and
        pin for authentication upon reaching the portal. Users must have a local account or an
        account created through the External User process on the Hurlburt domain. (Refer to
        Para 9.3.2.2., External Users)
AFSOCMAN33-304 17 NOVEMBER 2009                                                                33


                                          Chapter 10

                      DISCUSSION BOARDS, BLOGS AND WIKIS

10.1. Introduction to Discussion Boards, Blogs and Wikis. Discussion Groups, Blogs, and
Wikis are used when collaborating on official topics and discussions. Site Owners or Team
Leads are responsible for overall site management.
10.2. Discussion Boards.
   10.2.1. A discussion board is a forum for text conversations between two or more team
   members. Discussion boards provide the Team or Organization members with a central
   location where they can discuss specific topics or issues. The advantage of using discussion
   boards is that all team members can see the entire discussion thread so no one misses or
   misplaces an important discussion point. Most importantly, boards are fully searchable by
   title and content.
   10.2.2. A threaded discussion contains a record of all participant contributions to that online
   conversation. Though threaded discussions frequently begin as e-mail exchanges, they
   should be moved to discussion boards in SharePoint. Using e-mail for threaded discussions
   is inherently problematic for the following reasons:
       10.2.2.1. As recipients reply to an e-mail message, the threads (the replies and counter-
       replies) end up duplicated in many separate messages and/or recipients.
       10.2.2.2. It is possible for individual participants to be excluded from parts of the
       discussion entirely.
       10.2.2.3. The discussion history can become broken and it becomes difficult for
       participants to reassemble the threads.
       10.2.2.4. If the Team member is TDY or deployed, the discussion thread is archived and
       available for review upon return.
           10.2.2.4.1. For example, when discussing a specific topic related to a project,
           creating a discussion thread would be a recommended solution. This is more Team
           centric versus a Blog site which is normally open to all users.
10.3. Blog Sites.
   10.3.1. Blog sites are used to create an online journal called a web log or blog. These sites
   are designed to allow users to provide a chronicle around a specific topic and a discussion
   surrounding a process or topic to be captured over time. This is a SharePoint Team
   collaboration tool allowing people to publish news, responses to questions, and so forth.
   SharePoint offers only one Blog site template and comes with libraries and lists and web
   parts. The libraries and lists include categories, comments, links, photos and posts.
   Example: The Hurlburt Client Support Administrator (CSA) Lead can create a Blog site
   with categories focused on Request for Information (RFIs). These categories can be
   Procedure, Policy, etc. Team members can post a topic if they are looking for current
   procedures and the latest policy surrounding their CSA responsibilities. Instead of sending
   an e-mail to Hurlburt CSA distribution List, they can go to their centralized CSA Blog site
34                                                   AFSOCMAN33-304 17 NOVEMBER 2009


     and post, answer or find these types of information. This is useful for newly certified or
     appointed CSAs or for continuity purposes.
10.4. Wiki Site.
     10.4.1. A Wiki site is used to create a set of pages that are linked together; they can be used
     for brainstorming sessions or to create a knowledge base.
     10.4.2. Wiki site Libraries are customized and specialized Document Libraries that allow
     users to collaboratively contribute interconnected information. Wiki Libraries store wiki
     pages. Also Wiki page Libraries maintain the historical content of each page. Since the
     main purpose of the wiki page is for users to edit the information collaboratively, there arises
     the need for some control over the content that is published in the library. Version history
     and check in/out items are options in editing wiki Libraries and pages.
     10.4.3. A Wiki site is made up of a large content area that allows for editing of rich text,
     including formatting tables and most importantly linking to other wiki pages.
     10.4.4. For Example: A Squadron continuity book can be automated using wiki Libraries. It
     can contain an index or table of contents listing all the additional duties performed by several
     members in the Squadron. Each duty can be linked to another wiki page that explains how to
     perform a particular duty. Within the existing wiki page, users can also link to another page
     with related information about this particular duty. Members who are responsible for each
     additional duty can update their own page at any given time. This type of collaboration
     creates a knowledge base when a member of a Unit departs i.e., PCA, PCS, separation, or
     retirement.
AFSOCMAN33-304 17 NOVEMBER 2009                                                                  35


                                            Chapter 11

                                   NAMING CONVENTIONS

11.1. Introduction to Naming Conventions. Naming conventions are intended to provide ease
of recognition, search, and identification of stored data items. Naming conventions also help to
increase information sharing and ensure documents are not duplicated within the system.
11.2. Document Library Naming Conventions. Guidance in this paragraph is applicable to
site creations, Document Libraries, Folder and files.
   11.2.1. Document Libraries and Folders should be named based on the Subject (i.e., the type
   of information maintained in that particular Library). For example, when creating documents
   pertaining to the Government Travel Card in this particular Library or Folder. The
   Document Library or Folder name should be the Government Travel Card.
   11.2.2. No date-time-Group (DTG) or date created or version number EXCEPT for
   documents of historic reference, which will remain unchanged and may have legal or other
   significance. In these cases, a DTG is appropriate. (e.g., DTG of a message that the AOC has
   received and approved).
   11.2.3. When creating Team Sites, Libraries or Folders, do not use all CAPS except when
   referring to operations or exercises. Use upper and lowercase letters only. Clearly identify
   purpose and audience. Based on these criteria, organize sites and Document Libraries by
   areas of focus for the function or project.
   11.2.4. File Names. Documents and files will be named in a manner to clearly indicate the
   content of the document. Every effort should be made to ensure that documents are uniquely
   named; documents with the same names maybe considered duplicates and erroneously
   deleted.
       11.2.4.1. Invalid characters: " # % and * : < > ? \ / { | } ~ .
       11.2.4.2. Cannot be longer than 128 characters.
       11.2.4.3. User shall not use the period character consecutively in the middle of a file
       name.
       11.2.4.4. User shall not use the period character at the end of a file name.
       11.2.4.5. User shall not start a file name with the period character.
       11.2.4.6. User should not use spaces in a file name.              Rather, users should use an
       underscore versus a space.
   11.2.5. Folder Names.
       11.2.5.1. User shall not use the following characters anywhere in a Folder name or a
       server name: ~ # % and * { } \ : < > ? / | ".
       11.2.5.2. Cannot be longer than 128 characters.
       11.2.5.3. User shall not use the period character consecutively in the middle of a Folder
       name.
36                                                  AFSOCMAN33-304 17 NOVEMBER 2009


        11.2.5.4. User shall not use the period character at the end of a Folder name.
        11.2.5.5. User shall not start a Folder name with the period character.
     11.2.6. No abbreviations. Spell out file names that are not in the approved AF acronyms
     List.
     11.2.7. When creating a new List or Library on a site, the all-important required Name field
     takes on the double-duty of also generating a portion of the URL for the new List/Library.
     Therefore, be descriptive and use URL-friendly names (i.e., doesn't contain any spaces or
     special characters). Once the new List/Library is actually created and the URL has been
     generated, return to the settings and modify the Title into a more cosmetically pleasing
     phrase (spaces and all) without it affecting the URL. Another option would be to use an
     underscore in place of a space.
     11.2.8. Team Site names should be based on project names or IPT names.              Example:
     AFNETOPS Team Site.
     11.2.9. Naming Convention of SharePoint Groups. Site Owners should use the same naming
     convention format as the Active Directory. For example, if the SharePoint Group is created
     for members of the A6NZ Branch only, then the Group name should be AFSOC/A6NZ. If
     the SharePoint Group is created for members part of Team or Project, then the SharePoint
     Group name should be the same name of the Team or Project for example Site Owners. Site
     Owners should use the existing distribution listing in Active Directory first. Only create
     SharePoint Groups when it does not exist in AD. Site Owners are responsible for
     maintaining the SharePoint Groups they created.

                                           Chapter 12

                            OTHER USAGE AND GUIDELINES

12.1. Introduction to Other Usage and Guidelines. The following are capabilities that are
useful for anyone using the portal.
12.2. Alerts. Alerts give users automatic notification of changes to the site such as new uploads
and new versions of existing documents becoming available. Many Site Owners and end users
will want to manage their sites by setting alerts to let them know when changes have occurred
and review of new material is necessary. Alerts can be managed by site users by subscribing to
new additions to the site, library, folder or documents. In addition, Site Owners can push alerts
to a Group or certain user who requires knowledge of new information uploaded to sites.
12.3. Contact lists. Contact lists are centralized so all personnel involved in an activity are
listed in the Team Site. My colleagues feature is also available under My Site and is helpful for
listing all the critical contacts dealt with on a regular basis.
12.4. My Profile Page. As mentioned earlier under My Site, My Profile page is used to share
information with others. My Profile provides details about the user, as some information is
managed through active directory, while other information is available for update as needed.
   12.4.1. Name: As it appears in Active Directory.
   12.4.2. About me: A listing of professional descriptions such as AFSC, rank, special skill
   set (i.e., SharePoint, Access, Visio).
   12.4.3. Picture: Only official photos shall be uploaded to My Site.
   12.4.4. Responsibilities: A listing of current responsibilities such as additional duties ( i.e.,
   security manager, Site Owner, CSA, etc.).
   12.4.5. The profile page can be very useful when used properly. If the user profile page
   contains useful and unique information such as additional duties, Subject Matter Expert
   (SME) information, unique qualifications and certification, they can be found when these
   types of information are needed by using the search capability of SharePoint.
   12.4.6. For example: If a Squadron Commander is looking for a SME on specific topics or
   Site Owners within an AOR, the user can search the entire site using key words that describe
   the SME name or Site Owner. The power of the search capability and My Profile can be
   very critical and less time consuming.
12.5. Tasks List. The Task List template is one of the most commonly used templates in Team
collaboration sites and Meeting Workspaces. The Task List is used to assign and manage Tasks
for site users. The Task List template contains many different default views to provide users
with easy ways in which to display the tasks they are interested in.
   12.5.1. The Project Task List template takes the structure and views found in the Task List
   template and expands on them to provide rudimentary project planning aspects.
   12.5.2. Issue Tracking List template is similar to Task List, and is useful for creating a list of
   items where a user must take action. The Issues List is best suited to address problems or
   risks that must be mitigated and business opportunities that must be managed.

12.6. Survey. The Survey List template allows users to create lists that are presented to users as
a questionnaire. The Survey List is customized to make managing, responding to, and reporting
results a more efficient process. Surveys are an easy way to gain feedback from users. For
example: Use the Survey List to gain feedback about when conducting training classes,
conferences, organization events, or basic customer service feedback.
12.7. Workflow. As it relates to SharePoint, Workflow is the execution of a defined business
process incorporating the corresponding responsibilities, actions, tasks, and documents into the
process. Implementing a business process using a Workflow provides many benefits since tasks,
documentation, and data are maintained in a central location. Each Workflow requires two
SharePoint lists: Task List and Workflow history List. There are several types of Workflows
offered by SharePoint. The most common are approval Workflow, collect feedback Workflow,
and three-state Workflow. Example: When routing a document for review and coordination, as
the OPR, task either individuals or units to provide feedback by a specified time. The approval
or feedback Workflow features of SharePoint are very useful and easy to manage. In SharePoint,
users can route documents individually or parallel and assign a suspense date. Each action office
or officer will receive an e-mail tasking them of the document review and when they are finished
reviewing, it will route to the next person automatically (for serial Workflow). OPRs will not
need to generate an e-mail (the system is automated for this purpose), will not have to create a
Task (the Task List will be automatically generated by SharePoint tasking the individuals in the
Workflow, and users will always have constant visibility of document because of the Workflow
History List. Once the action officer receives and opens the document, the complete version will
be routed to the next person.

     HELPFUL HINTS WHEN CREATING SITES, DOCUMENT LIBRARIES AND
                             FOLDERS

13.1. Introduction to Helpful Hints when Creating Sites, Document Libraries, and
Folders. Create Team Site, Libraries and Folders using names that are clear and consistent. The
key is to be clear and, above all, consistent. For example users can choose to organize by:
   13.1.1. Branch/Section/Shop.
   13.1.2. Project or Function.
   13.1.3. Site Owners can also create a new Document Library or Folder in SharePoint for
   each project. Users can store all of files related to a project in a Document Library or Folder.
   This not only helps keep project files organized, but makes it easier if a project is reassigned
   for the new Team Site Owner to take ownership of all the associated materials.
13.2. Adhere to Standards of this Guide When Naming Files. Critical: be consistent in
reinforcing and using naming conventions.
13.3. Keep Only the Latest Versions of Working Documents. Remember to consult the
records professional for guidance on how to file final records and how to maintain draft records.
13.4. Contributor Responsibilities. The Team members with upload or contribute permission
should understand the naming conventions in this manual. This ensures the integrity of naming
and file structures within each section of the Team or Organization Site. Multiple people may
edit documents in various Folders or Document Libraries; however, Folder or Library creation
should be designated to certain people on the team for continuity.
13.5. Clearly Describe Library or Folder Contents. Using the description feature for each
Document Library or Folder is mandatory. As people on the Team change, they will need to
know what they can expect to find in different Document Libraries or Folders. Because users
include a clear description of each Folder, the new Team member knows what's in each Folder
and can find the documents they need to get up to speed a lot faster. This can be very useful with
constant personnel relocation. Site Owners or users should also modify the descriptions to note
when the project is completed.
13.6. Link to Files in SharePoint Folders. When working on a project, it‘s easy to just insert
or attach a file from the Team Site into an e-mail. By sending out different versions of the same
file, however, users could end up with multiple versions of the same document. It's far more
reliable to just insert a link to the document in an e-mail. Ensure users only have one version of
a document and link to it from other places when necessary.

            Managers for this application.
            14.1.2.2.2. The Training Manager should communicate the availability of this
            application to all organization end users. The Training Manager will be responsible
            for assigning the SharePoint End User Training to the end users, by way of the
            Training Application Site. The Training Manager will also be responsible for
            accomplishment of this training for all new members of the organization, based on the
AFSOCMAN33-304 17 NOVEMBER 2009                                                                41

   Guide/Manual, Hand Out, On Line Resources) located under the EIM User Support Site.
   14.2.2. Tier 1 (Site Owners/Train-the-Trainers Group). If the Tier 0 help is not sufficient,
   users may contact the Primary Site Owner for help. Primary Site Owner can determine if the
   issue is a SharePoint application specific problem. If the Primary Site Owner is unable to
   help, they carry the responsibility to contact Tier 2 (Unit CSAs, but this could already be the
   Primary Site Owner).
   14.2.3. Tier 2 (CSAs). If the Primary Site Owner is unable to help at this point, the CSAs
   can determine if the issue is a network/computer problem or contact the 1 SOW Network
   Support (Help Desk) for assistance.
   14.2.4. Tier 3 (1 SOW Network Support). Help Desk personnel will assign trouble ticket
   number for each problem and will assign the ticket to a specific team.
