                                                  INTRODUCTION

1. This qualification training package (QTP) was developed to make available a training aid which will assist
Surgical Service Technicians develop technical skills essential to performing specialized tasks. The tasks are broken
down into teachable elements, which help the trainer guide the trainee into becoming proficient with the tasks. The
QTP will also aid the task certifier when evaluating trainees for task certification.

2. As a trainer, go through each module (lesson) and identify which QTP tasks are appropriate for the trainee’s duty
position (items identified in the CFETP as core tasks are mandatory), then determine the order in which you want the
trainee to learn about each subject area. Direct the trainee to review the training references to better understand the
objective of each module. Go through the steps in the task performance with the trainee and allow for enough time
to learn each step; some objectives may take more time than others. Remember, the objective of the QTP is to
ensure the trainee can perform each task thoroughly. When the trainee receives enough training and is ready to be
evaluated on an objective, follow the evaluation instructions. Use the performance checklist as you evaluate each
objective. If the trainee successfully accomplishes the objective, document appropriately in the individual’s training
record. If the trainee does not accomplish the objective, review the areas needing more training until the objective is
met. Conduct a feedback with the trainee on each module. After the trainer has ensured and documented that the
trainee is qualified to perform the task, the trainee should be evaluated by a certifier.

3. The goal of the developers of this QTP is to publish a useful document for trainers and trainees that will meet Air
Force needs under the concepts outlined in the Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP). We value your
expertise in meeting this goal. If you find discrepancies in this QTP, or have suggestions for its improvement, or if
you have suggestions for other areas that may benefit from a QTP, please let us know about them.

                                              Inactive/return electrode (patient ground)
                                              Active electrode hand piece

OBJECTIVE:                                    The trainee will, without error, properly and safely set up and operate
                                              an electrosurgical unit

REMARKS/NOTES:                                Ensure that complete instruction manuals are readily available for
                                              operator reference, and that basic operating and safety instructions are
                                              conspicuously displayed on or attached to the unit. Since this task
                                              involves high-energy equipment used directly in hands-on patient care,
                                              ensure the trainee understands the process, knows inherent risk factors,
                                              and is closely supervised during the evaluation. The evaluator will
                                              STOP the procedure immediately and correct the trainee if
                                              performance may compromise safety. Ensure the trainee dons all
                                              personal protective equipment (PPE) required by current
                                              standards/precautions.


EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. This QTP should be evaluated during actual performance of the tasks.

2. After the trainee has received instructions, allow sufficient practice on each part of the task. The trainee must
   satisfactorily perform all parts of the task without assistance.

3. Use the appropriate checklist when evaluating the task to ensure all steps of the task are accomplished.

EQUIPMENT REQUIRED:                            Defibrillator, Patient electrodes, Conductive gel

OBJECTIVE:                                     The trainee will, without error, set up and safely operate a defibrillator

REMARKS/NOTES:                                 Technicians do not routinely operate defibrillators directly on patients.
                                               This QTP focuses on inspection and testing of defibrillators. Since
                                               this task involves high-energy equipment used in direct patient care,
                                               ensure the trainee understands the process, knows inherent risk
                                               factors, and is closely supervised during the evaluation. The
                                               evaluator will STOP the procedure immediately and correct the
                                               trainee if performance compromises safety. Ensure the trainee dons
                                               all personal protective equipment (PPE) required by current standards
                                               or precautions.


EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. This QTP should be evaluated during actual performance of the tasks.

2. After the trainee has received instructions, allow sufficient practice on each part of the task. The trainee must
   satisfactorily perform all parts of the task without assistance.

3. Use the appropriate checklist when evaluating the task to ensure all steps of the task are accomplished.

4. Document competency upon satisfactory completion of the evaluation. Initial evaluation should be documented
   in the Specialty Training Standard (STS). All recurring evaluation should be documented using AF Form 1098,
   Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, or using an approved substitute record.

                                           PERFORMANCE CHECKLIST
                       Set Up and Safely Operate Defibrillators                          SAT          UNSAT
                                     Inspection Phase
1. Inspect the defibrillator for cleanliness and damage
    a. Inspect external housing for signs of damage or indications of internal
        contamination by liquids
    b. Inspect all paddles, paddle cables, connectors, power cord(s) and plug(s) for
        visible damage
2. Inspect patient monitor electrodes, leads and cable(s)
    a. Correct type for machine
    b. Connectors and wires for frays, cracks, damage
3. Connect:
    a. Patient monitor/lead cable to monitor port
    b. Defibrillator paddle cables to paddle port
4. Check additional supplies:
    a. Expiration date (if applicable) of pads, internal paddles, drugs
    b. Inventory of defibrillator cart (local policy)
                                      Testing Phase
NOTE: This checklist outlines procedures for a typical test, ensure trainee follows
    local/manufacturer instructions for specific device
1. Disconnect AC power cord from wall outlet
2. Depress power “ON” button; battery self test indicators should briefly light, then
    message panel should display “ Battery”
3. Select energy output to recommended test setting (i.e. 360 joules)
4. Press “Charge” button; selected setting (360) should display
5. Ensure paddles are in test position
    a. Press discharge button on left paddle; should NOT discharge
    b. Press discharge button on right paddle; should NOT discharge
    c. Press “Synch” button (it should illuminate), then simultaneously press
        discharge buttons on both paddles; should NOT discharge;
    d. Press “Synch” button (it should no longer be illuminated)
    e. Simultaneously press discharge buttons on both paddles; defibrillator should
        discharge and test display should read selected setting
6. Test defibrillator’s patient monitor per manufacturer instructions and local policy
7. Plug AC cord into wall outlet
