Maintenance Group Commander (52 MXG/CC). The 52 FW Maintenance Operations Center
(MOC) will implement the 52 MXG/CC’s instructions and will request support from transient
alert home station/Major Command (MAJCOM) as required. Maintenance Flight will develop
CDDAR procedures in coordination with the 52 FW Command Post (52 FW/CP), 52d Civil
Engineer Squadron Fire Department (52 CES/CEF), 52 FW Ground Safety (52 FW/SEG), 52
CES Readiness and Emergency Management Flight (52 CES/CEX), 52d Medical Operations

CES/CED), 52d Operations Support Squadron Airfield Manager (52 OSS/OSAM) and other
on/off base agencies as applicable.
2. Generalized CDDAR Responsibilities:
     2.1. Supervisors at all levels must recognize the sources of hazards and apply appropriate
     safety practices to minimize their effect. There are an infinite number of possible emergency
     and crash recovery situations; therefore, specific procedures cannot be prescribed for every
     situation. All aircraft recovery actions are coordinated through the Emergency Support
     Function to the Incident Commander (IC). Practice/participation in 52 FW crash recovery
     exercises and implementation of operational risk management techniques are imperative for
     all emergency and crash recovery operations.
3. Definitions:
     3.1. Normal Responses: Aircrew declared emergency requiring crash recovery team
     response but limited action in recovering the aircraft. EXAMPLES: Flight control
     malfunctions, radio failures, bird strikes, low fuel. Hung ordnance and gun malfunctions do
     not require crash recovery to respond unless specifically requested by IC.
     3.2. Major Responses: Aircrew declared emergency requiring crash recovery team
     response and action in recovering/removing the aircraft. EXAMPLES: Landing gear
     extension failure, collapsed landing gear, blown tires, emergency power unit activation/
     hydrazine leaks/spills, hot brakes, hung flares, barrier engagement/cable arrestment, aircraft
     departs runway/taxiway and/or aircraft crashes.
     3.3. Incident Commander (IC): Individual assigned responsibility for directing and
     coordinating all emergency response and recovery actions.
     3.4. Senior Fire Official (SFO): Individual assigned responsibility for all fire fighting and
     rescue actions.
     3.5. Crash Recovery Team Chief (CRTC): Individual assigned responsibility for
     managing the crash recovery program according to AFIs, 52 FW mission plans, and
     applicable host-tenant agreements. Qualified members will be familiar with the following
     documents: OPREP-3 reports requirements as published in AFI 10-206 and local
     Commander’s Handbook for OPREP-3/CCIR reporting, AFI 21 -101CAFSUP 1, 52
     FW/Base Support Agreement, 52 FW IEMP 10-2, and Local Checklist (LCL)-52 MXG-11,
     Crash Recovery Response Checklist.
     3.6. Crash Recovery Team Supervisor (CRTS): Individual assigned responsibility for
     directing and coordinating aircraft recovery procedures and actions.

     equipment or training. In case of an AMC incident at Spangdahlem or in the immediate
     surrounding area, the 52 EMS CRT will act as an initial responder (with 726st Air Mobility
     Squadron augmentees) to secure the area and perform safing actions. The 726 AMS MOC
     will notify 618 TACC/XOCL Scott AFB, Illinois DSN 312-779-0363 and request assistance
     as required per AMC/USAFE Command to Command Agreement.
5. Crash Recovery Response Procedures.
     5.1. Normal Response:
        5.1.1. The CRT will consist of a recovery supervisor and one other recovery team
        member. The owning AMU may augment for tow supervisor or tow vehicle operator if
        the CRT requires it. The CRTS will respond with one CRTM in the tow vehicle. The
        CRTS will establish and maintain radio contact with the SFO or IC on the fire/crash net.
        5.1.2. If, upon landing, the aircraft stops on the active runway, the SFO or IC will
        determine if a fire or explosive hazard exists. Once the fire or explosive hazard is
        eliminated, the SFO or IC will normally clear the CRTS to begin recovery operations.
        5.1.3. The CRT will establish interphone and/or hand signal communication with the
        aircraft commander. If no further assistance is required, the CRT will recommend to the
        IC to clear the aircraft to taxi to End of Runway (EOR) and be de-armed by the EOR
        crew. The SFO or IC will normally terminate the In-Flight Emergency (IFE).
        5.1.4. If further assistance is required, the CRTS will supervise normal engine shutdown
        procedures on the runway. The CRT will, with the pilot as brake rider, tow the aircraft to
        an open parking location at either Bravo or Delta Arm/De-Arm pads. The EOR crew will
        respond to de-arm the aircraft. The CRTS will then contact the appropriate squadron, and
        based on mission requirements, either tow the aircraft to its designated location or request
        that the owning organization retrieve the aircraft from EOR. Once the aircraft has
        cleared the runway, the SFO or IC will normally terminate the IFE.
     5.2. Major Response:
        5.2.1. The CRT will consist of a recovery supervisor and two recovery members as a
        minimum. The CRTS will respond with one CRTM in the primary crash recovery
        vehicle. A second CRTM will standby with an aircraft tow vehicle for further guidance
        from the CRTS. If required, additional CRTMs will respond as necessary.
        5.2.2. The CRTS will establish and maintain radio contact with the SFO or IC on the
        fire/crash net.
        5.2.3. EPU Activations:
            5.2.3.1. Upon landing the aircraft will taxi to designated hydrazine area where the
            SFO will establish a 300 foot radius cordon and the fire crash crew will install wheel
            chocks, landing gear safety pins, and perform engine shutdown procedures. The fire
            crash crew will egress the pilot. NOTE: The SFO may expand the cordon size as
            warranted when hydrazine danger exists.
            5.2.3.2. The HRT supervisor will verify with the SFO that no fire or explosive hazard
            exists.
SPANGDAHLEMABI21-108 20 FEBRUARY 2014                                                          7


        5.2.3.3. The HRT will replace the fire crash crew’s safety pins with the aircraft safety
        pins and clear/safe the EPU system IAW LCL-52MXG-11and LCL-52MXG-36.
        5.2.3.4. Once the aircraft is declared clear/safe by the HRT supervisor, the HRT will
        contact the applicable AMU, via the MOC, for aircraft retrieval.
     5.2.4. Hot Brakes:
        5.2.4.1. The pilot, EOR crew, or CRT will be responsible for identifying potential or
        actual hot brake conditions.
        5.2.4.2. When an aircraft is declared as having a potential/actual hot brake condition,
        the SFO or IC will establish a cordon and determine if a fire or explosive hazard
        exists. Once the fire or explosive hazard is eliminated the SFO or IC will normally
        clear the CRT to begin recovery operations. CAUTION: It is impossible for the
        ground crew to avoid the hot brake and engine danger areas while installing the
        landing gear, EPU, wing tank pylon safety pins, or wheel chocks; therefore, the
        engine will be shutdown without installing the aircraft safety pins or wheel
        chocks. (Reference Technical Order (T.O.) 1F-16CM-1, Pilots Flight Manual)
        5.2.4.3. Prior to engine shutdown, the SFO will contact the pilot using Ultra High
        Frequency/Very High Frequency radio to confirm the EPU switch is in the “OFF”
        position and instruct the pilot to hold the aircraft in position using minimal brake.
        5.2.4.4. The pilot will remain in the cockpit until the brakes have cooled sufficiently.
        If the pilot must be extracted, 52 CES/CEF personnel will chock the nose tire before
        pilot extraction, after confirming the aircraft has been shut down.
        5.2.4.5. The SFO or IC will normally terminate the emergency and the CRT and one
        fire crash crew will monitor the aircraft.
        5.2.4.6. After 45 minutes the CRT will approach the wheel area from the front or rear
        only to assess hot brake condition. If condition still exists, the CRT will re-inspect at
        15 minute intervals until the hot brake condition no longer exists. When it is safe to
        approach the aircraft, the CRT will install the remainder of the safety pins and wheel
        chocks and EOR will de-arm the aircraft. The CRT will, based on mission
        requirements, request tow support from the owning squadron or tow aircraft to its
        designated location.
        5.2.4.7. If mission demands require immediate movement of aircraft and internal
        thermal plugs do not relieve tire pressure sufficiently to eliminate explosion hazard,
        the aircraft will be taxied over pre-positioned spike plates and recovered IAW with
        Paragraph 5.2.6.
     5.2.5. Hung Flare:
        5.2.5.1. The IFE aircraft will taxi to arm/de-arm pad depending on approach angle
        and the SFO will establish a cordon and determine if a fire or explosive hazard exists.
        If the fire or explosive hazard is eliminated, the SFO or IC will normally clear the
        CRTS to begin recovery operations.
        5.2.5.2. If the hazard could not be eliminated MOC will contact 52 CES/ CED with
        the location and nature of the emergency.

       5.2.5.3. 52 CES/CED will coordinate the clearing/safing of the flare dispenser IAW
       applicable EOD 60 Series T.O.s with the IC. The SFO or IC will normally terminate
       the emergency once the flare is clear/safe.
       5.2.5.4. The CRTS will establish interphone communication with the aircraft
       commander and supervise installation of the landing gear, EPU, wing tank pylon, and
       arresting hook safety pins.
       5.2.5.5. The CRTS will supervise engine shutdown procedures and egress the pilot.
       5.2.5.6. MOC will notify the applicable AMU to dispatch a tow team to tow the
       aircraft to its designated parking location.
    5.2.6. Blown Tires:
       5.2.6.1. If, upon landing, the aircraft stops on the active runway, the SFO or IC will
       determine if a fire or explosive hazard exists. Once the fire or explosive hazard is
       eliminated, the SFO or IC will normally clear the CRT to begin recovery operations.
       5.2.6.2. The EOR crew will respond to de-arm the aircraft.
       5.2.6.3. The CRTS will establish interphone/hand signal communication with the
       aircraft commander and supervise normal engine shutdown procedures. The pilot
       will egress the aircraft and the CRT will safe the aircraft for maintenance.
       5.2.6.4. The CRT will recover the aircraft IAW applicable safety standards, T .O.s
       and instructions.
       5.2.6.5. The CRT will tow the aircraft to an open parking location at either Bravo or
       Delta EOR pads. The CRTS will then contact the appropriate AMU to request the
       AMU send a tow crew to retrieve the aircraft from EOR. Once the aircraft has
       cleared the runway the SFO or IC will normally terminate the IFE.
    5.2.7. Barrier Engagement/Cable Arrestment:
       5.2.7.1. If the aircraft engages the barrier, the CRT will remain behind the fire safety
       vehicles until the aircraft is declared safe by the SFO or IC. The fire crash crew will
       determine if a fire or explosive hazard exists. Once the fire or explosive hazard is
       eliminated, the SFO or IC will normally clear the CRT to begin recovery operations.
       5.2.7.2. The CRT will establish interphone and/or hand signal communication with
       the aircraft commander and install the arresting hook safety pin. If no further
       assistance is required the aircraft will be cleared to taxi to EOR. The SFO or IC will
       normally terminate the emergency.
       5.2.7.3. If further assistance is required, the CRT will chock the aircraft, the EOR
       crew will respond to de-arm the aircraft, and the CRTS will supervise engine
       shutdown in the barrier.
       5.2.7.4. The CRT will install the applicable safety pins and remove the aircraft from
       the barrier and the runway. Once the aircraft is off the runway, the SFO or IC will
       normally terminate the emergency.
    5.2.8. Aircraft Departs Runway/Taxiway:

          5.2.8.1. Once cleared by the SFO or IC, the HRT will check F-16 aircraft for
          hydrazine leaks or spills. If leaks or spills are detected, the HRT will clear/safe the
          area IAW LCL-52MXG-36, F-16 Hydrazine Emergency Procedures for Leak
          Detection, Activated EPU Checks.
          5.2.8.2. The CRT will safe the aircraft for maintenance.
          5.2.8.3. The CRTS will monitor munitions safety or removal by the applicable AMU.
          5.2.8.4. The CRT will recover the aircraft IAW applicable safety standards, technical
          orders, instructions and direction of the IC or 52 MXG/CC
   5.3. Transient Aircraft:
      5.3.1. Transient Alert personnel will assist CRT with all transient aircraft emergencies
      and will supplement CRT upon request of CRTS or IC. Refer to T.O. 00-105E-9 for
      specific US Military and Civil aircraft hazards.
      5.3.2. Should a transient fighter aircraft become damaged, disabled, or crash, the MOC
      will notify the appropriate MAJCOM/unit for further handling instructions once the
      incident area/crash site is determined safe and secure. If the owning unit is on Temporary
      Duty (TDY) at Spangdahlem AB, the MOC will notify the TDY unit and request an
      aircraft technician and specialized equipment be dispatched to the scene. The Dispatched
      Technician will report to the IC, SFO or CRTS.
      5.3.3. Should a wide-bodied aircraft become damaged, disabled, or crash, the MOC will
      notify the appropriate MAJCOM/unit for further handling instructions once the incident
      area is determined safe and secure. Further actions will be accomplished IAW pre-
      established MAJCOM agreements, LCL-52MXG-11, Crash Recovery Response
      Checklist, or owning agency guidance.
   5.4. Tenant Agencies:
      5.4.1. The 52 EMS has overall responsibility for CDDAR operations. Tenant units are
      primarily responsible for assisting crash recovery operations with crew chief and
      specialist support, provide tow team and tow vehicle as required per AMC/USAFE
      Command to Command Agreement, to support the CRT. The 726 AMS will take charge
      of all emergency tow situations in the event an aircraft without structural damage requires
      removal from the active runway, to include IFE situations, hot brakes, blown or flat tires.
      The 52 EMS CRT will respond and render assistance as requested, however the 52 EMS
      CRT does not have heavy aircraft equipment or training. If an AMC aircraft has an
      incident, the 618 TACC/XOCL Scott AFB, Illinois DSN 312-779-0363 will be contacted
      via the MOC and request assistance through the major command. The 52 EMS CRT will
      only act as a first responder and render the site safe and secure.
6. On/Off-Base Recovery Procedures:
   6.1. The 52 FW/CC, through Disaster Response Force, i.e., 52 FW Command Post (52
   FW/CP), Unit Control Centers, Emergency Support Function and any specialized teams,
   coordinates on/off-base recovery actions.Refer to 52 FW Installation Emergency
   Management Plan 10-2, 52 FW Operation Plan 32-1, AFMAN 10-2504, AFI 91-203,
