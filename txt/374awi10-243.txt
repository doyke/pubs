       their UTC training and deployment or on-call timeframe. Members assigned to a UTC
       are subject to deploy in support of an Operations Plan (OPLAN) that takes priority over
       local augmentation requirements. Augmentation duties should not be grounds for a
       shortfall or reclama of a deployment tasking.

       recipients perform duty outside their Control Air Force Specialty Code (CAFSC). AFI
374AWI10-243 19 APRIL 2012                                                                   5

      in the United States Air Force, paragraph 4.12. should be reviewed and complied with if
      required. It is recommended that READY duty be no more than 120 days (90 days for
      SRB specialties) per year for augmentation duty.
3. Using the Augmentation Duty Program:
   3.1. Creating and deleting augmentation duty requirements.
      3.1.1. Requests to expand augmentation duty team size should be initiated by
      Augmentation Duty Team Coordinator and coordinated with augmentation duty team’s
      owning squadron commander, Group Augmentation Duty Coordinator, owning group
      commander, manpower advisor (for workload validation), Base Augmentation Duty
      Manager, and then presented at the next ADRB. Emergency requests should be
      presented to 374 AW/CV, through the chain of command.
      3.1.2. Requests to create a new augmentation duty team should be initiated by requesting
      squadron commander, and coordinated with the Group Augmentation Duty Coordinator,
      owning group commander, manpower advisor (for workload validation), Base
      Augmentation Duty Manager, and then presented at the next ADRB. Emergency
      requests should be presented to 374 AW/CV, through the chain of command.
      3.1.3. OPRs for base contingency plans should include ADRB-approved personnel
      augmentation requirements.
   3.2. Validation process of Augmentation Duty Program.
      3.2.1. The Augmentation Duty Program, including augmentation duty team requirements
      and unit ―fair share‖ will be revalidated annually by 374 FSS/FSMM.
      3.2.2. 374 FSS/FSMM will validate each unit’s wartime manpower requirements by
      operational audit. Initially, manpower requirements will be calculated using the
      applicable wartime Man-hour Availability Factor (MAF). The formula will be assigned
      strength – UTC-tasked personnel – mission essential personnel = available personnel for
      augmentation use. Manpower will calculate the number of squadron mission essential
      personnel in their validation. This method may be modified, as deemed necessary, by the
      ADRB.
      3.2.3. 374 FSS/FSMM will request each unit review annually the manpower validation
      worksheet from the prior year. If the unit has a substantial mission or personnel change,
      374 FSS/FSMM will revalidate their wartime manpower requirements.
          3.2.3.1. 374 FSS/FSMM provides results of the validation to the ADWG for review
          and recommendation to the ADRB. If the ADRB approves the recommendations, the
          ADRB will direct implementation.
          3.2.3.2. Unit requests for reduction of augmentation duty taskings should be put in
          writing and coordinated through their group commander for ADRB review. If a unit
          determines they no longer need to receive augmentation, this should be forwarded in
          writing to Base Augmentation Duty Program Manager and the unit(s) from which
          augmentees are received.
   3.3. Training.
6                                                            374AWI10-243 19 APRIL 2012


       3.3.1. Augmentation Duty Team Leaders schedule all augmentees for training and
       coordinated with Unit Augmentation Duty Coordinators.
       3.3.2. Training will be conducted during wing readiness training days to the fullest
       extent possible. Training on other days should be kept to an absolute minimum to not
       interfere with normal operations. Augmentation duty training dates will be approved by
       the 374 AW/CV.
       3.3.3. Training will be conducted IAW AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, to
       include proper documentation in both the individuals augmentation duty folder and a
       copy sent to supervisors for submission into AF Form 623A, On-The-Job Training
       Record-Continuation Sheet.
       3.3.4. Training plans will be developed and utilized by the Augmentation Duty Team
       Leader.
       3.3.5. Training status of each augmentee will be reviewed quarterly and annotated in the
       Base Augmentation Duty Program SharePoint site by Augmentation Duty Team Leaders.
       This information can be reviewed at ADWG, ADRB, wing staff meetings, or other
       meetings as requested by wing leadership. Augmentation duty team status will be briefed
       by the Augmentation Duty Team Leaders to ensure team specific requirements are
       accurately projected to wing leadership.
    3.4. Initiating the Augmentation Duty Program.
       3.4.1. All requests for Augmentation Duty Team activations must be approved by the
       374 AW Commander (374 AW/CC).
           3.4.1.1. Augmentation Duty Team Leaders request activation of the Augmentation
           Duty Program through the chain of command.
       3.4.2. The Augmentation Duty Program may be initiated by the following methods:
           3.4.2.1. Pyramid recall. Per YOKOTA ABI 10-202, Yokota Air Base Recall
           Procedures, certain recalls will activate the augmentation duty teams.
           3.4.2.2. If an augmentation duty team is not activated by wing recall then a
           Installation Control Center Directive (ICCD) will be the primary method of
           activation. Using a ICCD reduces miscommunication, ensures rapid dissemination,
           and protects Operation Security (OPSEC).
       3.4.3. Unit commanders are responsible for ensuring personnel assigned to augmentation
       duty teams report as directed when the Augmentation Duty Program is activated.
