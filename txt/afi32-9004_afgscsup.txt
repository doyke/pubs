2.1. The Base Civil Engineer (BCE) develops and maintains a current 5-year disposal plan. For
each year of the plan, give the number, description, quantity (such as square feet or linear feet),
estimated disposal cost (including environmental abatement costs), and method of
accomplishment (such as in-house, contract, or reserve forces) of each facility to be disposed.
2.4.1. Wing and installation commanders are delegated authority to approve disposal of all
facilities when the total current value of the property listed on the AF Form 300, Facility
2                                                    AFI 32-9004_AFGSCSUP 1 JUNE 2010

Disposal, does not exceed $5000 and delegation is not prohibited by paragraph 2.4.3 nor
buildings destroyed by fire. Facilities cannot be disposed, however, until the wing/base has
complied with the terms of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act outlined in
AFI 32-9003, Granting Temporary Use of Air Force Property.
2.5. For each building approved by Congress for construction, the Base Civil Engineer prepares
and submits to HQ AFGSC Programs Division a listing of buildings to be disposed when
construction is completed.
2.5.1. (Added) Committed buildings do not need to be the ones replaced by the new
construction. Consider committing one or more facilities (of equal or greater square footage than
the new construction) which are the least usable, both functionally and structurally.
2.5.2. (Added) Buildings committed to Congress must be disposed within 6 months following
physical completion or beneficial occupancy of the new construction unless a request for
retention is approved by HQ AFGSC/A7P.
2.5.3. (Added) Requests to substitute committed buildings with other buildings of equal or
greater square footage must be sent to HQ AFGSC/A7P, through the wing (if applicable) for
review and approval.
2.5.4. (Added) On 31 October of each year, each wing/base will submit a letter to
HQ AFGSC/A7P, 841 Fairchild Ave, Barksdale AFB, LA 71110, giving the status of all
committed buildings.
