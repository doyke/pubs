AFI11-2B-2V1 9 JUNE 2010                                                                      7


     1.2.4.4. Forward supplements of this volume and Wing syllabi to AFGSC/A3T for
     review each training cycle, or upon significant changes. Review supplements each
     training cycle.
  1.2.5. Squadron (SQ) supervision will:
     1.2.5.1. Ensure adequate continuity and supervision of individual training needs,
     experience, and proficiencies of assigned/attached pilots.
     1.2.5.2. Ensure review of training and evaluation records of newly-assigned pilots and
     those completing formal training to determine the training required for them to achieve
     BMC or CMR and to ensure provisions of this instruction have been met.
     1.2.5.3. Ensure RAP missions are oriented to developing basic combat skills or
     practicing tactical employment simulating conditions anticipated in the unit mission.
     Provide guidance to ensure only effective RAP missions are logged as RAP sorties. See
     Attachment 2 for RAP mission definitions.
     1.2.5.4. Review qualifications and training requirements of Flight Surgeons (FS) and
     determine appropriate flight restrictions.
     1.2.5.5. Determine missions/events in which individual BMC pilots will maintain
     qualification versus familiarization.
     1.2.5.6. Determine utilization of BMC pilots.
     1.2.5.7. Determine how many and which BMC and CMR pilots will carry special
     capabilities/ qualifications.
     1.2.5.8. Identify the levels of supervision required to accomplish the required training,
     unless specifically directed.
     1.2.5.9. Determine breadth and depth of supervisory review of weapon delivery
     recordings.
     1.2.5.10. Assist the wing/group in developing unit training programs.
     1.2.5.11. Monitor individual assigned/attached pilot’s currencies and requirements.
     1.2.5.12. Ensure pilots participate only in sorties, events, and tasks for which they are
     adequately prepared, trained, and current.
     1.2.5.13. Ensure T-38 Companion Trainer Program (CTP) properly supports B-2 combat
     crew capability.
     1.2.5.14. AFGSC squadrons will submit a training report to HQ AFGSC/A3TO every 4th
     month during the training cycle (Feb and Jun). Squadrons may submit an out of cycle
     report at anytime if Higher Headquarters (HHQ) assistance is required to prepare for
     Designed Operational Capability (DOC) or Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) tasking.
     Reports will consist of: 1) an email memo summarizing results or unresolved issues since
     the last report, current training plan summary, and significant shortfalls/Limiting Factors
     (LIMFACS) affecting training. Significant shortfalls/LIMFACS, or other training
     problems can be considered a trend or condition which, if unchecked, has the potential to
     become a critical condition. For example, if the squadron is unable to accomplish actual
     weapons release due to a shortage of training munitions, a shortfall exists that if
 8                                                                 AFI11-2B-2V1 9 JUNE 2010


        unresolved could deteriorate to a critical condition affecting MQT, Upgrades, or RAP
        training health. 2) A filled out squadron training health slide (attachment to email memo)
        summarizing critical training issues. Both items IAW the guidance and examples at the
        web site https://a3.asgsc.af.mil/dot/DOTO/RAP_ReportingTools.asp. Reports will
        reflect different phases of training unique to each AEF pair. Key reports are the Post-
        AEF (end of the 1st month after AEF Vulnerability period) and the Pre-AEF (3 months
        prior to AEF Vulnerability period). Others are snapshots of a squadron’s training health.
        Report only significant shortfalls/LIMFACS of events/sorties that affect 15% or greater
        of the squadron’s crew force. Include possible solutions or specific assistance required if
        able. HQ AFGSC will attempt to rectify or minimize noted shortfalls/LIMFACS while
        the training cycle is under way.
            1.2.5.14.1. Shortfalls occur when required mission training tasks are not
            accomplished due to shortages of equipment, munitions, ARMS software, etc.
            Example: unable to accomplish actual weapons release due to a shortage of training
            weapons.
            1.2.5.14.2. LIMFACS are factors, constraints, restrictions, etc. that degrade training
            effectiveness. Example: squadron's ability to accomplish actual weapons release is
            limited due to the lack of ranges that allow aircraft to drop munitions. This may
            include support hardware and software.
            1.2.5.14.3. All deviations from these training requirements, after proration, will be
            reported to AFGSC/A3TO with the Post-AEF (end of the 1st month after AEF
            Vulnerability period) RAP Training Health Report IAW AFGSC/A3TO Web Site.
            This includes requirements waived by Operations Group Commander (OG/CC).
            Email training reports to AFGSC/A3TO RAP program manager at
            accdoto.rapreporting@langley.af.mil, DSN 574-8323.
     1.2.6. Individual pilots will:
        1.2.6.1. Hand carry all available training records to assist the gaining unit in assessing
        qualifications and training requirements.
        1.2.6.2. Be responsible for completion of training requirements and currencies within the
        guidelines of this instruction.
        1.2.6.3. Ensure they participate only in ground and flying activities for which they are
        qualified and current.
1.3. Processing Changes:
     1.3.1. Forward recommendations for change to this instruction to MAJCOM A3T on AF
     Form 847 (IMT), Recommendation for Change of Publication.
     1.3.2. MAJCOMs will forward approved recommendations to HQ AFGSC/A3 through HQ
     AFGSC/A3TO.
     1.3.3. HQ AFGSC/A3 will:
        1.3.3.1. Coordinate all changes to the basic instruction with all applicable
        MAJCOM/A3s.
        1.3.3.2. Process recommendation for change.
AFI11-2B-2V1 9 JUNE 2010                                                                        9


       1.3.3.3. Forward recommended interim changes and revisions to HQ USAF/A3OT for
       HQ USAF/A3/5 approval.
       1.3.3.4. Address time-sensitive changes by immediate action message.
   1.3.4. MAJCOM/A3 will determine training requirements for subordinate units. This
   includes making changes, additions, or deletions to this volume at any time. These changes
   may be via supplement or RAP Tasking Memo. HQ AFGSC/A3 will be an info addressee on
   all changes.
   1.3.5. Units will annotate all changes in this document, referring operators to the current
   supplement or RAP Tasking Memo.
1.4. Training: Training programs are designed to progress pilots from Initial Qualification
Training (IQT), or Re-Qualification Training (RQT), then Mission Qualification Training
(MQT), and finally to Continuation Training (CT).
   1.4.1. IQT and RQT provide the training necessary to initially qualify a crewmember in a
   basic position and flying duties without regard to the unit’s mission. The B2 IQT (Universal
   Pilot) syllabus qualifies new crewmembers to perform pilot and mission commander duties in
   the B-2. Normally, MQT training is accomplished in conjunction with IQT. However, at
   completion of IQT/RQT, any further MQT training will be accomplished at the unit. Upon
   completion of IQT or RQT, the crewmember attains Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ)
   status. Except for WG/CC, WG/CV, and general officers above wing level, BAQ is not a
   long-term qualification status. Waiver authority for any pilots, other than WG/CC, WG/CV,
   and general officers above the wing level, to remain BAQ for longer than 6 months is
   MAJCOM A3.
   1.4.2. MQT provides the training necessary to initially qualify or re-qualify pilots in a
   specific position and flying duties to perform the missions assigned to a specific unit. Pilots
   maintain BAQ status until they complete MQT. Completion of MQT or a Formal Training
   Unit (FTU) instructor course is a prerequisite for BMC and CMR.
   1.4.3. There are two aspects of CT. The first consists of pilot training in the basic flying
   skills contained in Table 5f., located in the RAP Tasking Memo. These skills (non-RAP
   requirements) ensure safe operation of the aircraft. The second consists of specific mission-
   related training required to accomplish the unit’s assigned missions.
   1.4.4. RAP is the CT program designed to focus training on capabilities needed to
   accomplish a unit’s core tasked missions. Following completion of IQT/RQT and MQT,
   pilots are trained in all the basic missions of the unit, unless excepted in Chapter 3. The
   pilot is assigned to either a CMR position or a BMC position.
       1.4.4.1. CMR. The minimum training required for pilots to be qualified and proficient in
       all of the primary missions tasked to their unit and weapon system.
       1.4.4.2. CMR Positions. All Designated Combat Aircraft (CC-Coded) unit active duty
       API-1/2 positions, flying Squadron Commander (SQ/CC), and Squadron Operations
       Officer (SQ/DO) positions are designated CMR positions. OG/CCs may designate other
       API-6 positions not assigned to the flying squadron as CMR. (EXCEPTION: If a unit is
       over-manned, the SQ/CC may elect to train no more than the number of API-1/2
       authorizations earned by the Unit Manpower Document (UMD) to CMR and designate
 10                                                               AFI11-2B-2V1 9 JUNE 2010


      the overage BMC. Approximately 50% of the pilots selected for CMR must be
      inexperienced and should be given priority.) CMR pilots maintain proficiency and
      qualification in all core missions of the flying unit to which they are assigned or attached.
      CMR pilots maintain currencies which affect CMR status, accomplish all core designated
      flight training (sorties and events), and all mission ground training. Failure to complete
      this training or maintain these currencies results in regression to Non-CMR (N-CMR)
      status, unless waived by appropriate authority. While N-CMR, pilots may perform
      missions (including exercises and contingencies) in which they are current, qualified, and
      either familiar or proficient, similar to BMC pilots.
      1.4.4.3. BMC. The minimum training required for pilots to be familiarized in all, and
      may be qualified and proficient in some, of the primary missions tasked to their unit and
      weapons system.
      1.4.4.4. BMC Positions. All other active duty wing pilot positions, not identified in
      paragraph 1.4.4.2., are designated BMC positions. BMC designations are assigned to
      pilots who have a primary job performing wing supervision, or staff functions that
      directly support the flying operation, FTU instructors or operational test aircrew.
      However, these pilots are required to provide additional sortie generation capability,
      either in lieu of or in addition to, the personnel assigned to the flying squadrons. BMC
      pilots maintain familiarization with all unit core missions. They may also maintain
      proficiency and qualification in some of the unit core missions. For missions in which
      they maintain familiarization only, BMC pilots must be able to attain proficiency and
      qualification in 30 days or less. BMC pilots accomplish all mission-related ground
      training designated by their attached SQ/CC. BMC pilots may deploy and may
      participate in any mission for which they are proficient and qualified, without additional
      training, as determined by the SQ/CC. Failure to complete BMC required training results
      in regression to Non-BMC (N-BMC) status. While N-BMC, pilots may not perform
      RAP training sorties without supervision (per paragraph 1.5.4) until SQ/CC approved
      re-certification program is complete.
      1.4.4.5. N-CMR/N-BMC. Pilots that regress to N-CMR/N-BMC status will accomplish
      the requirements IAW paragraph 4.7.1.2
      1.4.4.6. Specialized Training. Specialized training is training in any special skills
      necessary to carry out the unit’s assigned missions that are not required by every pilot.
      Specialized training consists of upgrade training such as Mission Commander (MC)
      upgrade, flight lead upgrade (FLUG), etc., as well as CT, to maintain proficiency and
      qualification in unit tasked special capabilities and missions. Specialized training is
      normally accomplished after a crewmember is assigned CMR/BMC status, and is
      normally in addition to CMR/BMC requirements. Unless otherwise specified, pilots in
      CMR or BMC positions may hold special capabilities/qualifications as long as any
      additional training requirements are accomplished.
1.5. Training Concepts and Policies:
   1.5.1. Units will design training programs to achieve the highest degree of combat readiness
   consistent with flight safety and resource availability. Training must balance the need for
   realism against the expected threat, pilot capabilities, and safety. This instruction provides
AFI11-2B-2V1 9 JUNE 2010                                                                        11


   training guidelines and policies for use with operational procedures specified in applicable
   flying/operations publications.
   1.5.2. ACC Training Support Squadron (ACC TRSS) will develop and validate training
   programs when/where tasked by the HQ ACC/A3. Other MAJCOMs may submit requests
   for training program support to the HQ ACC/A3. If validated, these requests will be
   prioritized and tasked to ACC TRSS. Designated Test Units (CB-Coded) may develop
   syllabi to upgrade Operation Test Aircrew in support of specific test plans. These syllabi will
   be approved by the OG/CC and submitted to ACC TRSS.
   1.5.3. Units will design training missions to achieve combat capability in squadron-tasked
   roles, maintain proficiency, and enhance mission accomplishment and safety. RAP training
   missions should emphasize either basic combat skills, or scenarios that reflect procedures and
   operations based on employment plans, location, current intelligence, and opposition
   capabilities. Use of procedures and actions applicable to combat scenarios are desired (e.g.,
   appropriate use of code words, authentication procedures, combat tactics, safe recovery
   procedures, tactical deception, threat reactions, Intel briefing/debriefing, etc).
   1.5.4. Inflight Supervision: Unless specifically directed, the SQ/CC determines the level of
   supervision necessary to accomplish the required training. If the mission objectives include
   introduction to tasks or instruction to correct previous discrepancies, then an instructor may
   be required.
   1.5.5. Pilots are not required to accomplish ground and/or ancillary training except as
   required by this instruction or AFI 36-2201V1, Training Development, Delivery, and
   Evaluation.
   1.5.6. Tactical training will include use of inert and live ordnance, threat simulators, Aircrew
   Training Devices (ATDs), and dissimilar aircraft as much as possible.
1.6. RAP Policy and Management:
   1.6.1. The pilot training cycle is 12 months and is aligned with the fiscal year. Each RAP
   qualification level is defined by a total number of RAP missions/sorties, broken down into
   mission types, plus specific weapons qualifications and associated events as determined by
   the MAJCOM and unit commanders.
   1.6.2. The total number of RAP sorties accomplished for a qualification level is the primary
   factor for maintaining an individual’s qualification level. The breakout of sortie/mission
   types is provided as a guideline to be followed as closely as possible, however, minor
   variances are authorized. Variances in sorties/mission types may be used as a basis for
   regression by the SQ/CC. Qualification in a mission is determined by the SQ/CC
   considering MAJCOM guidance and the individual’s capabilities.
   1.6.3. An effective RAP training sortie requires accomplishing either a tactical mission
   profile or a building block type training sortie. Each mission profile or training sortie
   requires successfully completing a significant portion of the events applicable to that sortie
   type, as determined by the SQ/CC and Attachment 2.
   1.6.4. The SQ/CC’s first priority is to train all designated pilots to CMR.
   1.6.5. Progression from BMC to CMR requires:
 12                                                                AFI11-2B-2V1 9 JUNE 2010


      1.6.5.1. A 1-month look-back at the higher sortie rate.
      1.6.5.2. Qualification in all missions and weapons events required at CMR.
      1.6.5.3. Confirmation the progressed pilot can complete the prorated number of
      sortie/event requirements remaining at CMR by the end of the training cycle.
      1.6.5.4. Completion of mission-related ground training, to include a current verification
      and nuclear certification.
      1.6.5.5. Squadron CC certification.
   1.6.6. SQ/CCs will determine and assign pilots that will maintain special capabilities or
   qualifications, including in-unit Aircraft Commander and Instructor upgrade. Specialized
   training is normally accomplished in addition to baseline CMR/BMC sortie/event
   requirements.
   1.6.7. CMR and BMC pilots will fly at or greater than the required monthly sortie rate. If
   unable, refer to Regression, paragraph 4.7
   1.6.8. End of Cycle training requirements are based on the pilot’s experience level on the
   last day of the current training cycle.
   1.6.9. Units converting to another Mission Design Series (MDS) may fly pilots in CMR
   positions at the BMC rate until one month prior to the operationally ready date if the
   Utilization Rate (UTE) rate will not support CMR sortie rates. CMR pilots should be flown
   at a CMR rate for the month prior to Initial Operational Capability (IOC).
   1.6.10. Units will complete training requirements during the appropriate training cycle
   unless where specifically excepted.
1.7. Training Sortie Program Development:
   1.7.1. RAP sortie and event requirements (see Attachment 2) apply to CMR and BMC
   pilots as well as those carrying special capabilities or qualifications and are IAW the RAP
   Tasking Memo. The standard sortie requirements at Table 1.1 establish the minimum
   number of sorties per AEF training cycle for BMC and CMR levels of training. The current
   RAP Tasking Memo takes precedence over this instruction, and may contain an updated
   sortie requirement or missions/events not yet incorporated in Attachment 2.
   1.7.2. Non-RAP requirements are in addition to RAP requirements. These sorties ensure
   basic pilot skills are maintained.
   1.7.3. Collateral or Cost of Business sortie requirements must be considered when
   developing unit flying hour programs. These sorties are not directly related to combat
   employment training but are necessary in day-to-day unit operations. These include but are
   not limited to instructor sorties, ferry flights, incentive/orientation flights, deployments, and
   air shows. For the AEF training cycle, MAJCOM allocates a block of sorties to the unit for
   these purposes.
   1.7.4. Unit flying hour programs are allocated a number of attrition sorties that compensate
   for non-effective training sorties. Non-effective sorties are logged when a training sortie,
   RAP or Non-RAP, is planned but a major portion of valid training for that type of mission is
AFI11-2B-2V1 9 JUNE 2010                                                                         13


   not accomplished due to poor weather, air aborts, etc. In order to accurately allocate the
   number of attrition sorties, it is essential that non-effective sorties are logged appropriately.

Note 1: Current RAP sortie requirements are based on the selection of highly qualified pilots for B-2
Initial Qualification. Expect sortie requirements to increase as pilot experience level decreases.

1.8. Training Records and Reports:
   1.8.1. Units will maintain crewmember records for individual training and evaluations IAW:
        1.8.1.1. AFI 11-202V1, Aircrew Training.
        1.8.1.2. AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program.
        1.8.1.3. AFI 11-401, Aviation Management.
        1.8.1.4. AFGSCI 11-464, Training Records and Performance Evaluation in Formal
        Flying Training Programs.
        1.8.1.5. Appropriate MAJCOM directives.
   1.8.2. Units will track the following information for all pilots (as applicable):
        1.8.2.1. Ground training.
        1.8.2.2. Requirements and accomplishment of individual sorties, RAP sorties, sortie
        types, and events cumulatively for the training cycle.
        1.8.2.3. RAP sortie requirements and accomplishment using 1-month and 3-month
        running totals for lookback.
        1.8.2.4. Requirements and accomplishment of individual currencies.
        1.8.2.5. Weapons employment records in sufficient detail to document all employment
        attempts as well as to compute miss distance, simulated/actual releases and event hit
        percentage histories.
   1.8.3. Units may fill in ARMS "NO DATE" events with either the date it was accomplished
   in FTU, or USAFWS-equivalent training accomplished, or the unit mission certification date.
1.9. Weapons Delivery Recording.
 14                                                               AFI11-2B-2V1 9 JUNE 2010


   1.9.1. Pilots will use and assess all available training documentation such as Digital Video
   Recorder (DVR), or Teleoptical Scoring System (TOSS) on all tactical missions. Flight
   Leads will review and score the video for all of the aircraft in their formation as necessary
   after every mission. Mission Commanders will review video for their sortie if single-ship.
   1.9.2. As a guide, the following DVR items should be reviewed: weapons parameters,
   aiming accuracy, rules of engagement, adherence to Training Rules (TR) and tactical
   employment.
1.10. Pilot Utilization Policy:
   1.10.1. Commanders will ensure that wing/group tactical pilots (API-1/2/6s) fill authorized
   positions IAW unit manning documents and that pilot status is properly designated. The
   overall objective is that pilots perform combat-related duties. Supervisors may assign pilots
   to valid, short-term tasks (escort officer, Flying Evaluation Board (FEB)/mishap board
   member, etc.), but must continually weigh the factors involved, such as level of pilot tasking,
   flying proficiency, currency, and experience. For inexperienced pilots, supervisors will limit
   the non-flying duties to those related to combat activities.
   1.10.2. Duties that may be assigned to CAF API-1/2 pilots are weapons and tactics officer,
   scheduling officer, flying safety officer, Supervisor of Flying (SOF), mobility/contingency
   plans, training (except ARMS documentation), SQ Standardization/Evaluation Liaison
   Officer (SELO), squadron flight equipment officer, electronic combat officer, and other
   duties directly related to flying. In some instances, such as squadron-assigned flight safety
   officers, API-1/2s may be attached to the wing/group. API-1/2s will not be attached to
   wing/group staffs or man wing/group staff positions unless total wing pilot API-1/2 manning
   is 100 percent or better. CCs will ensure wing/group staff pilots (API-6s) perform duties
   justified in MAJCOM manpower standards documents and authorized in UMDs.
   1.10.3. API-1/2 pilots will not perform long-term duties that are outside the scope of 1.10.2
   which detract from primary duties of training for or performing the unit flying mission for
   longer than 30 days.
1.11. Sortie Allocation and Unit Manning Guidance:
   1.11.1. In general, inexperienced API-1 pilots should receive sortie allocation priority over
   experienced pilots. Priorities for sortie allocation are as follows:
       1.11.1.1. Operational Units.   CMR API-1, MQT API-1, CMR API-6, MQT API-6,
       BMC.
       1.11.1.2. FTUs and USAFWS. Formal syllabus training, Instructor Pilot (IP) upgrade,
       IP CT, authorized staff personnel not performing IP or Flight Examiner (FE) duties.
       1.11.1.3. Test and Evaluation Squadron (TES) Units. Requirements directed by
       MAJCOM, training required to prepare for assigned projects/tasking, and BMC training
       requirements that cannot be accomplished on primary missions.
       1.11.1.4. Test and TES Units. Requirements directed by MAJCOM, training required to
       prepare for assigned projects/tasking, BMC training requirements that cannot be
       accomplished on primary missions, API-5 aircrew physicians.
AFI11-2B-2V1 9 JUNE 2010                                                                       15


    1.11.2. Wing API-6 authorizations are IAW unit manning documents. Active duty wings
    converting to new Primary Aircraft Inventory (PAI) are authorized one SQ equivalent of
    additional API-6s during the conversion period. However, total wing staff flying the new
    aircraft shall not exceed total authorized for final conversion equipage.
    1.11.3. For wings consisting of both FTU and operation units, at least one of the following
    pilots will maintain formal instructor status: Wing Commander (WG/CC), Vice Wing
    Commander (WG/CV), OG/CC, and Deputy Group Commander (OG/CD).
    1.11.4. API-8 rated personnel, AFGSC/IG Inspectors in API-6 billets, and Test Unit aircrew
    flying authorizations will be IAW AFI 11-401 and MAJCOM guidance. They will maintain
    BMC qualification; however, they are not required to complete BMC specific
    missions/events or meet monthly lookback requirements. Test unit pilots will fly the BMC
    sortie rate as a minimum and should meet monthly BMC look-back. Units should provide
    assigned API 6/8 flyers adequate resources to maintain minimum training requirements.
    However, API-6/8 flyer support will not come at the expense of the flying squadron’s
    primary mission. API 6 flyers will accomplish Non-RAP requirements with allotted BMC
    sorties. API-8 flyers will strive to accomplish Non-RAP requirements with allotted BMC
    sorties. If attached units cannot meet attached flyer requirements, they must request relief
    IAW AFI 11-401, AFGSC Sup. Units requiring flying hour adjustments for attached API-8
    and applicable API-6 flyers must request program changes IAW AFI 11-101(AFGSC Sup),
    Management Reports and Guidance for Flying Hour Program.
    1.11.5. There is no maximum sortie requirement for CMR pilots. Table 1.2 defines the
    minimum and maximum sortie requirements for other pilots. On occasion, unique operations
    may require pilots to fly more than the maximum number of sorties authorized. However,
    this may impact training of other pilots.

                          MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. General: MQT upgrades pilots to BMC or CMR in order to accomplish the unit’s mission.
MQT is primarily an FTU program that is part of IQT/RQT, but may be accomplished (or
completed) in the bomb squadron for unusual circumstances. For test aircrew, MQT will
normally be accomplished by the respective test unit, and qualification training will be
determined by SQ/CC. Applicable portions of MQT may be used to create a requalification
program for pilots who have regressed from BMC or CMR to specifically address deficiencies
which caused regression. MQT will train pilots to accomplish the unit mission. All training
events accomplished to the required proficiency level during IQT/RQT are creditable (if
applicable) for MQT. Accomplish waived FTU proficiency items prior to declaring the
individual BMC/CMR. MQT events not accomplished during the IQT syllabus should adhere to
the guidance in paragraph 3.4 below. Units are allowed to tailor this program for all pilots, based
on experience, currency, documented performance, and formal training. For RQT, B-2 MQT
status (CMR/BMC as applicable) will be regained upon completion of RQT 1480 block,
CMR/BMC (as applicable) requirements IAW 11-2B-2 Volume 1 Table 7.1. (see current RAP
Tasking Memo), and completion of conventional verification and/or nuclear verification (as
applicable) IAW AFI 11-2B-2 Volume 1.
   3.1.1. Qualifications and flight evaluations may be accepted from other MAJCOMs,
   provided they meet MAJCOM and unit standards.
   3.1.2. MQT requirements for upgrading FTU graduates may be reduced commensurate to
   the quality and quantity of MQT received at the FTU. If these graduates received a mission
   evaluation at the FTU, they do not require an initial local mission evaluation. Instead, their
   local MQT program should consist only of ground and flying training unique to the unit.
   Upon completion of this training, the pilot will be certified BMC or CMR by the SQ/CC.
   3.1.3. All MQT (including conventional verification and nuclear certification for CMR) will
   be completed within 90 calendar days after completion of squadron in-processing for
   CMR/BMC pilots and 6 months for Basic Qual/Staff officers. Notify the HQ AFGSC/A3T if
   unable to complete the required training within this time limit. Training is complete upon
   SQ/CC certification.
       3.1.3.1. For nuclear certification, see AFGSCI 10-450V2, Nuclear Committed Aircraft—
       Nuclear Planning.
       3.1.3.2. For conventional verification, each pilot will demonstrate to a formal board
       satisfactory knowledge of the unit’s assigned mission. Board composition will be
       established by the SQ/CC. Required board composition is SQ/CC or Operations Officer
       (Chairman), squadron weapons officer, assigned flight commander, squadron intelligence
       representative. Electronic combat officer, plans representatives, and other board
       members as determined by the SQ/CC are desired. All squadron pilots are highly
       encouraged to attend. Suggested briefing guide is at Attachment 3.
   3.1.4. Pilots in MQT will not fly on Flag or Global Power missions (Exception: Pilots who
   have completed all conventional MQT events, verified by SQ/CC, and documented
   conventional verification in training folder).
 22                                                               AFI11-2B-2V1 9 JUNE 2010


   3.1.5. Currency and frequency dates are established by the date the appropriate event was
   last accomplished, regardless of training status.
3.2. Ground Training: Units will develop blocks of instruction covering areas pertinent to the
mission as determined by the SQ/CC. Training accomplished during IQT may be credited
towards this requirement. This training should include:
   3.2.1. Unit Tasking
   3.2.2. Unit tactics and employment
   3.2.3. Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) Code of Conduct Continuation
   Training (CoCCT) IAW AFI 16-1301, SERE Program, and MAJCOM SERE supplements.
   3.2.4. Nuclear Emergency Action Procedures
   3.2.5. Flash Blindness Protection
   3.2.6. Nuclear Surety Training
   3.2.7. Small Arms Training
3.3. Simulator Training: MQT pilots will fly the missions outlined below as typical RAP
profiles. Each training device mission will include selected critical action emergency procedures
and instrument procedures.
   3.3.1. Weapon System Trainer (WST) MQT-1--Conventional Weapons Employment
   Procedures. Heavyweight takeoff, weapons deliveries (to include GPS Aided Targeting
   (GATS)), jettison procedures, Defensive Management System (DMS) activity, emergency
   divert procedures, and hung ordnance procedures.
   3.3.2. WST MQT-2--Nuclear Weapons Employment Procedures. Alert start, base escape
   launch, degraded navigation, DMS activity, nuclear weapons delivery and malfunction
   procedures, and divert procedures.
3.4. Flying Training: In the event MQT was not completed at the FTU, the unit(s) must
prepare a training program designed to mission qualify individuals and prevent regression of
proficiency. The appropriate missions from those listed below will be used to upgrade to BMC
or CMR. Squadron-developed MQT programs should use profiles typical of squadron missions.
   3.4.1. A SQ supervisor, IP, or weapons officer is required for MQT sorties. The SQ/CC will
   determine the proper flight position of the supervisor/IP.
   3.4.2. At a minimum a conventional and a nuclear sortie must be accomplished, one of
   which must be flown at night. As a guide, units will fly these sorties as the RAP mission
   profiles listed in Attachment 2 A2.4.1 The conventional sortie should include an actual
   weapons release. A minimum of one of these sorties will be flown in formation.
   3.4.3. Mission     evaluations    are     flown    IAW     AFI  11-202V2     and   local
   standardization/evaluation criteria on a mission representing the unit’s primary mission
   tasking.     This evaluation is normally accomplished in conjunction with an
   instrument/qualification evaluation at the completion of IQT.
3.5. Transferring Between Units: BMC or CMR individuals transferring between units will
complete MQT as determined by the gaining unit SQ/CC. This training should be based on
AFI11-2B-2V1 9 JUNE 2010                                                                       23


experience, proficiency, currency, and previous formal training of the transferring individual. If
the gaining unit’s assigned weapons are different, accomplish Weapons/Tactics academics as
required. BMC or CMR individuals transferring between units must receive the Unit Mission
Briefing. Pilots must complete applicable Nuclear Functional Training in Table 7.1 published in
the current RAP Tasking Memo and posted at the back of this AFI.
 24                                                              AFI11-2B-2V1 9 JUNE 2010


                                          Chapter 4

                               CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. General: This chapter and the current B-2 RAP Tasking Memo outlines ground and flying
training requirements for CMR, BMC, and BAQ pilots. Refer to Chapter 6, Specialized
Training, for additional training program specifics. Pilots must be qualified IAW AFI 11-202V1
and AFI 11-202V2. Additionally, they must complete BQT, IQT, or RQT to fly in BAQ status,
and MQT to fly in BMC or CMR status.
4.2. Ground Training: Ground training will be accomplished IAW Table 7.1, published in the
current RAP Tasking Memo. Waiver authority for ground training specified is IAW the
reference directive. Unit commanders will ensure pilots accomplish academic training
requirements. Commanders may direct additional training as necessary to ensure all pilots attain
and maintain a state of proficiency which will permit immediate and successful completion of
the assigned mission. An individual who instructs a class receives credit for that academic
training requirement. Ground training accomplished during FTU/MQT/ USAFWS may be
credited toward CT requirements for the training cycle in which it was accomplished. This table
is intended to be a reference for MDS-specific ground training only. This table does not include
non-MDS specific ancillary training, which will also be tracked at unit level. Where
discrepancies exist, the reference directive takes precedence.
   4.2.1. ATDs:
       4.2.1.1. Table 6. a., located in the current version of the B-2 RAP Tasking Memo,
       depicts the minimum ATD training requirements. HQ AFGSC/A3T will determine the
       minimum number/type of ATD missions that require supervision. Units should
       determine additional CT training device supervision requirements based on expected
       employment tasking and mission training objectives. Pilots maintaining CMR will
       accomplish at least two ATD’s each month, or at least six ATDs every 3 months. Pilots
       maintaining BMC will accomplish at least one ATD each month or at least three ATDs
       every 3 months. ATD accomplishment is tied to CMR/BMC status. The intent of the
       ATD is to supplement but not replace actual flying. If a pilot is able to fly more than
       CMR/BMC rates (as applicable) in a single month then ATD requirements can be
       reduced to no lower than 1 ATD per month.
       4.2.1.2. Ensure scenarios are based on expected employment tasking and training device
       capabilities. Emphasis should be placed on training not readily attainable during daily
       flying activities.
       4.2.1.3. Simulator Certification (SIMCERT) will be done by 29 TSS. The 29 TSS will
       certify the ATD to command standards before crediting transfer of task learning from the
       ATD to the aircrew. Flight evaluation completion may be accomplished per AFI 11-2B-
       2V2 for events certified Code 1 through SIMCERT. Certified Code 1 RAP and Non-
       RAP events accomplished in the WST may be credited towards training cycle
       requirements but may not be used to update currency, except for instrument approaches,
       takeoffs, bomb runs, single engine-out approaches and go-arounds. Refer to Table 5e.
       and Table 5f. in the current version of the B-2 RAP Tasking Memo for RAP/Non-RAP
       events creditable in the WST.
AFI11-2B-2V1 9 JUNE 2010                                                                       25


       4.2.1.4. Pilots will accomplish spatial disorientation events in the WST per Table 5f. in
       the current version of B-2 RAP Tasking Memo.

   4.2.2. Situational Emergency Procedure Training SEPT:
       4.2.2.1. This training is not an evaluation, but a review of abnormal/emergency
       procedures and aircraft systems operations/limitations during realistic scenarios. SEPTs
       should be accomplished in small flight-sized groups so all members may participate to
       the fullest extent possible. One crewmember should present an abnormal/emergency
       situation and the group should discuss actions necessary to cope with the malfunction and
       carry the scenario to a logical conclusion. Critical action procedures and squadron
       special interest items should be emphasized.
       4.2.2.2. The intent of SEPT training is that each crewmember accomplishes a SEPT in
       the month they are flying. SEPT training will be accomplished each calendar month, and
       the currency will expire at the end of the following month. Failure to accomplish by the
       end of the month will result in grounding until subsequently completed.
       4.2.2.3. Incorporate the following elements into squadron SEPT training programs:
          4.2.2.3.1. SQ/CC or DO will approve the monthly SEPT topic.
          4.2.2.3.2. Develop SEPT scenarios using B-2 mishaps/incidents as baseline cases.
          4.2.2.3.3. Completion of a WST Emergency Procedure (EP) profile satisfies the
          monthly SEPT requirement. For an IP, administering the WST EP Sim will satisfy
          their SEPT requirement.
          4.2.2.3.4. Formal course student SEPTs may satisfy the monthly SEPT requirement
          for the IP who administers this training.
   4.2.3. Verification (Conventional):
       4.2.3.1. (Required for CMR pilots; BMC pilots as determined by
       SQ/CC.) Continuation verification updates pilots on their squadron’s wartime mission.
       Each pilot will participate in a squadron initial/continuation verification every 20 months
       as a briefer, board member, or seminar participant. Pilots may also receive recurring
 26                                                                 AFI11-2B-2V1 9 JUNE 2010


       verification credit by serving as a member of a mission planning cell designated exercise
       or military campaign. Suggested briefing guide is at Attachment 3.
   4.2.4. Weapons/Tactics Academic Training
       4.2.4.1. Units will establish a weapons/tactics academic training program to satisfy MQT
       and CT requirements. Training is required in each training cycle. Audiovisual programs
       may be used in place of academic instruction.
       4.2.4.2. Academic instructors should be USAFWS graduates, if possible.
       4.2.4.3. Instruction should include (as applicable), but is not limited to:
          4.2.4.3.1. Conventional weapons to include description, operation, parameters,
          fuzing, limitations, preflight, tactics, normal and emergency procedures/techniques.
          4.2.4.3.2. Specialized training emphasizing effective employment to include

       Tasking Memo requires loss of designation/qualification.
       4.3.4.4. Recertification/Requalification is IAW paragraph 4.6
   4.3.5. Designated Test Unit Requirements:
       4.3.5.1. API-1/6 pilots assigned/attached to Test units will fly at the BMC rate and
       accomplish the Non-RAP BMC requirements as shown in the RAP Tasking Memo, as
       applicable. In addition to RAP missions, formal training syllabus-directed missions and
       approved test plan missions apply to the BMC rate requirement for assigned/attached
       API-1/6 pilots at Test units. For instructors, failure to accomplish these requirements will
       not affect instructor status, but will require additional training as determined by the
       SQ/CC prior to performing instructor duties in the delinquent events.
       4.3.5.2. The squadron commander of the Test unit will certify the pilot’s capability to
       perform the specific test function.
4.4. Special Categories.
 28                                                               AFI11-2B-2V1 9 JUNE 2010


   4.4.1. FTU Instructors, 325 WPS Instructors, TRSS/DET 12 Subject Matter Experts (SMEs),
   and 29 TSS/DET 5 SMEs must maintain a limited combat capability. FTU/WIC/SME sorties
   are not a separate RAP category, however, they can log a RAP sortie when RAP sortie
   requirements are met IAW Attachment 2. FTU/WIC/SME instructors/cadre will fly at the
   BMC experienced rate. To maintain BMC, FTU, WIC instructors, and SMEs must meet the
   BMC event totals and currency requirements in the RAP Tasking Memo and meet the BMC
   lookback requirements but they do not need to meet the RAP sortie type, event or weapon
   requirements specified in the RAP tasking message. An FTU/WIC instructor or SME that is
   non-current or unqualified will be considered N-BMC IAW paragraph 4.6.2 and will be
   reported as such until the currency/qualification is regained. Regression is not applicable for
   this category.
   4.4.2. FS. Due to the limited number of B-2 sorties, flight surgeons will not fly in the B-2.
   Flight surgeons are encouraged to perform WST missions and fly in CTP aircraft.
   4.4.3. MAJCOM and NAF API-8 Pilots, and AFGSC/IG Inspectors:
      4.4.3.1. Mission Directed Training (MDT) for HHQ personnel (other than that conducted
      in support of a formal inspection) requires coordination with the supporting unit.
      MAJCOM Directors (Division Chiefs for Flight Safety and IG) and NAF/A3 (AOG)/OV
      are reviewing authorities for assigned personnel. They will:
          4.4.3.1.1. Coordinate with the supporting agency to ensure appropriate ARMS data is
          maintained and provided IAW AFI 11-401.
          4.4.3.1.2. Review assigned pilot accomplishments and currencies prior to authorizing
          participation in MDTs.
          4.4.3.1.3. Provide each pilot with written documentation specifying the sortie types
          and events the crewmember is authorized to fly.
      4.4.3.2. HHQ flying personnel maintaining BMC status are exempt from non-grounding
      academic ground training and special training programs within authorized mission areas.
      Specific currencies will be provided to the host squadron and HHQ supervisors will
      determine crewmember qualifications to participate in squadron scenarios for MDT.
      4.4.3.3. HHQ pilots will:
          4.4.3.3.1. Review accomplishments and currencies for accuracy.
          4.4.3.3.2. Submit qualification/authorization documentation to the supporting SQ/CC
          or operations officer prior to flying with that squadron.
          4.4.3.3.3. Evaluate the demands of each mission scenario and ensure that their
          ability/proficiency will not be exceeded.
      4.4.3.4. HHQ instructor pilots may perform instructor duties, with the concurrence of the
      OG/CC, if qualified and current for the applicable missions/events.
      4.4.3.5. HHQ staff pilots may participate in tactical training events. Pilots will present
      documentation summarizing currencies, egress training, flight qualifications, etc., to the
      unit where flying is performed.
4.5. Multiple Qualification/Currency:
AFI11-2B-2V1 9 JUNE 2010                                                                        29


   4.5.1. MAJCOM A3 may authorize qualification in more than one MDS aircraft for
   crewmembers only when such action is directed by command mission requirements and is
   economically justifiable. This authority cannot be delegated below MAJCOM level. Unless
   required for unit mission accomplishment, commanders must not permit crewmembers
   qualified in primary mission aircraft to maintain qualification in support aircraft. Individuals
   assigned to positions covered by paragraph 4.4 or paragraph 4.5.2 have MAJCOM A3
   approval, and do not need to submit specific requests.
      4.5.1.1. Submit multiple qualification requests through command channels to MAJCOM
      A3T. All requests must contain full justification. Approval for multiple qualification
      requests must be provided to the appropriate host base flight management office; flight
      accomplishments are not authorized until aircraft assignment is updated into ARMS.
      4.5.1.2. Individually authorized multiple qualifications are valid as long as the individual
      is assigned to the specific position, and aircraft requested, or rescinded by MAJCOM A3.
   4.5.2. Multiple qualifications are authorized for pilots and instructor pilots participating in
   the CTP or maintaining tactical aircraft qualification in the applicable companion
   trainer/chase aircraft.
   4.5.3. Multiple qualifications are not appropriate for senior wing supervisors of units with
   different types of aircraft, with the exception of the CTP program. Wing commanders will
   qualify in only one of their wing’s aircraft. Either the WG/CV or OG/CC should qualify in
   another of the wing’s aircraft (not the same one selected by the WG/CC). (For AFGSC: See
   AFGSCI 11-450, Orientation Flight Programs, for policy on Senior Supervisor
   Familiarization Flights.)
   4.5.4. Pilots maintaining multiple qualifications will fly at least once each 45 days in each
   aircraft. They will comply with all other currency requirements for each aircraft. Note: B-2
   pilots dual qualified in the T-38 under the provisions of the B-2 CTP will complete both
   MDS annual training requirements.
4.6. Currencies/Recurrencies/Requalification:
   4.6.1. Currency. Table 4.5 defines currency requirements for all B-2 pilots. If a pilot loses
   a particular currency, that sortie/event may not be performed except for the purpose of
   regaining currency as noted.

Table 4.5. Pilot Currencies (CMR/BMC/BAQ).

For recurrency, unless otherwise noted, reference paragraph 4.6.2.3. Refer to Tables 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3
in the current version of the B-2 RAP Tasking Memo for RAP/Non-RAP events creditable in the
WST.
1. Must be day current to refuel or land at night unsupervised
2. If non-current 60 days or less, pilots may fly the event unsupervised and update their currency
provided the other pilot is current. If non-current for more than 60 days, event must be flown with an
instructor. Event may be accomplished in the WST for initial currency and to update currency (with
an instructor).
3. Applies to simulated bomb runs only. Pilots non-current for bomb run may not update currency on
an actual release unless they are supervised by a current IP.


      4.6.1.1. Nuclear surety training, if applicable, must be accomplished once every 15
      months IAW AFI 91-101, Air Force Nuclear Weapons Surety Program and the ETCA
      website. Individuals delinquent in nuclear surety training will not perform alert duty,
      nuclear generate, or have access to nuclear weapons.
   4.6.2. Recurrency:
      4.6.2.1. Recurrency is required whenever a pilot does not meet currency requirements of
      this instruction.
      4.6.2.2. Overdue training requirements must be satisfied before the pilot is considered
      qualified to perform tasks applicable to that type of training. Training annotated as
      affecting CMR status will require regression to N-CMR until appropriate training as
      specified by SQ/CC is accomplished. Training identified as not affecting CMR status
      does not require regression from CMR, although it may result in grounding until training
      is completed (e.g., aircrew flight equipment training). The duration of grounding and
      status of sortie lookback will determine the effect on CMR status.
      4.6.2.3. Regaining currency is based on time elapsed from the date the individual became
      non-current. Note: Use landing currency to determine when the individual became non-
      current.
          4.6.2.3.1. Up to 180 Days: Training as directed by the SQ/CC and a proficiency
          demonstration of the non-current event to an instructor.
          4.6.2.3.2. 180 to less than 2 years: Training as directed by the SQ/CC. Individuals
          need to requalify only in events required by their training level. Once certified
          proficient in the non-current event by an instructor, a flight check by an evaluator is
          required. This evaluation need include only those non-current items that would be
          evaluated during an initial qualification check and documented IAW AFI 11-202V2
          (AFI 11-2B-2V2). A crewmember’s qualification zone may be reset if all items
          normally evaluated on an initial qualification check are accomplished.
AFI11-2B-2V1 9 JUNE 2010                                                                       31


   4.6.3. Requalification Training: Note: An aircrew member is unqualified upon expiration
   of his or her qualification evaluation, loss of currency exceeding 6 months (see paragraph
   4.6.2.3.2), or completion of a qualification evaluation in a different MDS (Exception:
   multiple qualification in CTP aircraft).
      4.6.3.1. Unqualified 2 years to 5 Years: Complete an FTU requalification academic
      course, in-unit or FTU flight training, and a flight evaluation in accordance with
      paragraph 2.8 and the B-2 Requalification Training Course Syllabus.
      4.6.3.2. Unqualified over 5 years: Individuals non-current over 5 years will complete
      the Initial Qualification Course.
   4.6.4. Loss of Requalification to Instructor Status. Instructors will be decertified if:
      4.6.4.1. They fail a flight check. To regain instructor status, the instructor must
      successfully complete a flight evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2 and AFI 11-2B-2V2.
      4.6.4.2. They fail a qualification, instrument, or mission examination. To regain IP
      status, the IP must successfully re-accomplish the written exam.
      4.6.4.3. They become non-current in an event/sortie which causes removal from
      CMR/BMC status and the SQ/CC deems that loss of currency is of sufficient importance
      to require decertification. If the SQ/CC does not elect this option or if the instructor
      becomes non-current in events/sorties which do not require removal from CMR/BMC
      status, instructor status may be retained, but the IP will not instruct in that event/sortie
      until the required currency is regained.
4.7. Regression:
   4.7.1. CMR/BMC Regression for Failure to Meet Lookback. Only RAP training and
   Contingency Operations sorties may be used for lookback. If a pilot does not meet lookback
   requirements throughout the training cycle, SQ/CCs can either: regress the crewmember to
   N-CMR/N-BMC status, as applicable; remove the pilot from a CMR manning position; or
   initiate action to remove the pilot from active flying status.
      4.7.1.1. Failure to meet 1-month RAP/Contingency Operations sortie lookback requires a
      review of the pilot’s 3-month sortie history. If the 3-month lookback has been met, pilots
      may, at SQ/CC discretion, remain CMR/BMC. Failure to meet the 3-month lookback
      will result in regression to N-CMR/BMC status as appropriate, or the pilot may be placed
      in probation status for 1 month at the SQ/CC’s discretion. If probation is chosen, the
      only way to remove a pilot from probation and preserve the current status is to reestablish
      a 1-month lookback by the end of the probation period (see Figure 4.1).
      4.7.1.2. CMR pilots regressed to N-CMR for lookback must complete a SQ/CC
      approved program to return the crewmember to CMR status. BMC pilots regressed to N-
      BMC must complete a SQ/CC directed program. Upon completion of the program,
      CMR/BMC pilots must also meet the subsequent 1-month lookback requirement prior to
      reclaiming CMR/BMC status. The sorties and events accomplished during the program
      may be credited towards their total/type sortie and event requirements for the training
      cycle as well as for their monthly sortie requirement.
      4.7.1.3. Look-back computations begin the calendar day following completion of MQT.
      The pilot must maintain 1-month look-back until 3-month look-back is established.
 32                                                                AFI11-2B-2V1 9 JUNE 2010


   4.7.2. Regression for Weapons Qualification: Failure to maintain RAP tasked weapons
   qualification at the end of the training cycle for events tasked as Qual at CMR/BMC will
   require regression to N-CMR/N-BMC unless waived by the OG/CC. To regain CMR/BMC,
   the pilot must re-achieve initial qualification in the deficient weapons event (see paragraph
   5.2). Events accomplished for this initial qualification may count toward the cumulative CT
   event qualification required at the end of the next training cycle.
   4.7.3. Failure of Evaluations. Pilots who fail an aircraft qualification, mission, or instrument
   evaluation will be handled IAW AFI 11-202V2 and AFI 11-2B-2V2. Pilots will regress to
   N-CMR or N-BMC as applicable. These pilots will remain N-CMR/N-BMC until
   successfully completing required corrective action, a reevaluation, and are recertified by the
   SQ/CC.
4.8. End of Cycle Training Requirements: Pilots who fail to complete sortie and/or event
requirements of this instruction by the end of the training cycle may require additional training
depending on the type and magnitude of the deficiency. Refer to paragraph 4.9 to see if some of
these requirements can be prorated. In all cases, report training shortfalls IAW paragraph
1.2.5.14
   4.8.1. Pilots who fail to meet the total RAP sortie requirement may continue CT at
   CMR/BMC as determined by lookback. The SQ/CC will determine if additional training is
   required.
   4.8.2. Pilots who fail to meet annual Non-RAP sortie and/or event requirements may
   continue CT at CMR/BMC as determined by lookback. The SQ/CC will determine if
   additional training is required. Failure to meet Non-RAP sortie and/or event requirements for
   BQ results in supervised status until successful training is accomplished, as determined by
   the SQ/CC.
   4.8.3. Failure to meet RAP Sortie Type Requirements will result in one of the following:
       4.8.3.1. Regression to N-CMR/N-BMC if the SQ/CC determines the sortie type
       deficiency is significant. To regain CMR/BMC the pilot will complete all deficient sortie
       requirements. These sorties may be counted against the total requirements for the new
       training cycle.
       4.8.3.2. Continuation at CMR/BMC if total RAP sorties and lookback are maintained
       and the sortie type deficiencies are deemed insignificant by the SQ/CC.
   4.8.4. Failure to accomplish sorties required for Special Capabilities/Qualifications will
   result in loss of that qualification. The SQ/CC will determine requalification requirements.
4.9. Proration of End-of-Cycle Requirements: At the end of the training cycle, the SQ/CC
may prorate all training requirements when Duties Not Involving Flying (DNIF), emergency
leaves, non-flying Temporary Duty (TDY)/exercises, FTU training, combat/contingency
deployments, and/or Air Reserve Components (ARC) mandatory training required by civilian
employment preclude training for a portion of the training cycle. Ordinary annual leave will not
be considered as non-availability. Extended bad weather which precludes the unit from flying
for more than 15 consecutive days may be considered as non-availability. The following

AFI11-2B-2V1 9 JUNE 2010                                                                      33


  4.9.1. Proration will only be used to adjust for genuine circumstances of training non-
  availability, not to mask training or planning deficiencies.
  4.9.2. Proration is based on cumulative days of non-availability for flying during the training
  cycle. Use Table 4.6 to determine the number of months to be prorated based on cumulative
  calendar days of non-availability.
  4.9.3. If IQT or MQT is reaccomplished, a pilot’s training cycle will start over at a prorated
  share following completion of IQT/MQT.
  4.9.4. For example, Capt Jones was granted 17 days of emergency leave in January and
  attended SOS in residence from March through April for 56 consecutive calendar days. His
  SQ/CC authorized a total of 2 months proration from his training cycle (2 months for the 73
  cumulative days of non-availability for flying.)
  4.9.5. Prorated numbers resulting in fractions of less than 0.5 will be rounded to the next
  lower whole number, but no requirement may be prorated below one.
  4.9.6. Newly assigned/converted pilots and pilots achieving CMR/BMC after the 15th of the
  month are considered to be in CT on the first day of the following month for
  proration/lookback purposes. A prorated share of RAP sorties must be completed in CT.
  4.9.7. Night and Air Refueling (AR) requirements accomplished during MQT may be
  credited toward prorated CT requirements if accomplished during the cycle in which the pilot
  was declared CMR/BMC, unless specified otherwise by MAJCOM.
  4.9.8. A pilot’s last month on station prior to departing Permanent Change of Station (PCS)
  may be prorated. Individuals departing PCS may be considered CMR for reporting purposes
  during a period of 60 days from date of last flight, or until loss of CMR currency, port call
  date, or sign in at new duty station.
  4.9.9. CMR pilots who attend USAFWS in TDY-and-return status may be reported CMR
  until the requirements of AFGSCI 10-450 Vol 6, paragraph 2.3.2.2.4, (Aircrew Emergency
  Actions Procedures Training) are no longer met. Upon return, these pilots will accomplish a
  prorated share of sortie/event requirements (see Table 4.6).
  4.9.10. Contingency operations can have a positive or negative impact on a unit’s CT
  program, as emphasis is on supporting the actual contingency. A potential lack of training
  opportunities while deployed can place a burden on the unit, forcing it to accomplish the
  majority of its CT program in a reduced period of time at home station. The following
  proration procedures are intended to provide flexibility in accomplishing the unit’s CT
  program.
     4.9.10.1. Normally, all sorties flown during contingency operations will be logged on AF
     Form 1522 as contingency operations sorties. These sorties do not count toward annual
     RAP requirements, but may be used for lookback purposes. RAP events logged during
     contingency operations sorties do not count toward annual RAP requirements, but may be
     used to update currencies. Upon return from contingency operations, units will prorate
     RAP sorties and events for the period of time each individual was deployed. In addition,
     proration is authorized for deployment preparation and deployment recovery time where
     home station flying is reduced by the MAJCOM.
 34                                                               AFI11-2B-2V1 9 JUNE 2010


         4.9.10.2. As the training quality of missions flown at contingency locations may vary
         considerably, OG/CCs are authorized to allow sorties that provided valid training to be
         logged as RAP sorties. Events accomplished on these sorties count toward RAP event
         requirements, and these sorties/events may not be prorated upon return to home station.
         4.9.10.3. Upon return from contingency operations, proration is computed by calculating
         the sorties to be prorated for the entire deployment, and then subtracting the number of
         valid RAP sorties as authorized by the OG/CC. The result is the allowable sortie
         proration. Negative numbers equate to zero. Events will be prorated at SQ/CC discretion
         based on the events accomplished during valid RAP sorties.

4.10. Regaining CMR/BMC Status:
   4.10.1. If CMR/BMC status is lost due to failure to meet the end of cycle weapons
   qualifications and/or event requirements, requalification is IAW paragraph 4.7.2
   4.10.2. If CMR/BMC status is lost due to failure to meet lookback IAW paragraph 4.7, the
   following applies (timing starts from the date the crewmember came off CMR/BMC status):
         4.10.2.1. Up to 90 days, per paragraph 4.7.1.2
         4.10.2.2. 91-180 days, same as above, plus qualification and tactical written
         examinations.
         4.10.2.3. 181 days and beyond, reaccomplish MQT.
AFI11-2B-2V1 9 JUNE 2010                                                                    35


4.11. Example of the Look-back, Regression, Proration, and Requalification Process:
   4.11.1. Capt Smith is an inexperienced CMR pilot in AFGSC with a 1- and 3-month
   lookback requirement of two and six RAP sorties, respectively. On 3 Feb, he flew a RAP
   sortie prior to departing for a non-flying TDY staff tour for 2 months. He reported back for
   flight duty on 6 Apr. What is his status throughout his TDY and on his return?
      4.11.1.1. The SQ/CC wanted to list Capt Smith as a countable CMR pilot for reporting
      purposes throughout the TDY. Therefore, on 1 Mar, his Flight Commander (Flt/CC)
      performed the mandatory 1-month lookback (Feb) on Capt Smith. He only flew one
      RAP sortie, failing the 1-month lookback. The Flt/CC then performed a 3-month
      lookback (Dec, Jan, Feb). This showed that he flew only five sorties for this period. Had
      he flown one more sortie, his SQ/CC could continue Capt Smith at CMR. However, with
      five sorties, Capt Smith did not meet the 3-month lookback for a CMR pilot. The SQ/CC
      could regress Capt Smith to N-CMR, but instead elected to put him on probation, still
      carrying him as CMR.
      4.11.1.2. On 1 Apr, Capt Smith’s 1-month lookback (Mar) was zero sorties. The SQ/CC
      must now regress Capt Smith to N-CMR. The SQ/CC will have to place him in a
      recertification program. Upon completing this program, Capt Smith will then need to
      accomplish a WST in April and reestablish his 1-month lookback by 1 May. Failing to
      do so would force him to be reported N-CMR 1 additional month until the next lookback
      process on 1 June.
      4.11.1.3. At the end of the training cycle, the SQ/CC prorated 2 months off of Capt
      Smith’s total requirements. In spite of this proration, Capt Smith was deficient in one
      RAP sortie type category. The SQ/CC could regress Capt Smith to N-CMR, if deemed
      significant. After accomplishing the tailored re-certification program (the deficient
      sorties), the SQ/CC would re-certify Capt Smith to CMR. This training sortie counts for
      the new training cycle.

               WEAPONS DELIVERY EMPLOYMENT QUALIFICATION

5.1. General. This chapter outlines requirements for attaining initial qualification and
maintaining CT qualification for CMR pilots in the employment of air-to-surface weapons.
Refer to "Description of Events" at Attachment 2 for further guidance on weapons events.
Weapons delivery/employment qualification is not required for Test aircrew.
   5.1.1. The OG/CC has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining the weapons
   qualification program.
   5.1.2. Weapons qualification will be achieved by completing a minimum number of record
   deliveries and achieving a minimum percentage of record hits during the training cycle.
   5.1.3. Graduates of the B2 IQT syllabus are required to maintain weapons qualification as an
   individual event.
       5.1.3.1. Graduates of the B2 IQT syllabus may log 50% of their record release
       requirements in the WST.
5.2. Initial Qualification. Graduates of the B-2 IQT syllabus must accomplish initial
qualification in any weapons event requiring qualification at CMR/BMC. Initial qualification
achieved in IQT or MQT satisfies requirements for CT qualification, but not for CT event
requirements. Initial qualification will carry over for consecutive tours in the B-2. RQT students
previously weapons qualified need to meet the requirements of the RQT syllabus (proficiency as
listed to include live/inert release) to regain weapons qualification status. Upon completion of
RQT, the pilot will need to accomplish required record releases IAW paragraph 5.3
   5.2.1. Initial qualification is satisfied when the pilots have accomplished 6 record deliveries
   (actual or simulated) for each of the following: GBU-31/28, GBU-38, AGM-154/158, B-
   61/83, and Conventional Unguided weapon record releases. DVR/WST scoring may be
   used; however, WST scoring will not exceed 50% of the required deliveries per weapon
   category. The pilot must achieve a minimum hit rate of 50 percent on those deliveries.
   5.2.2. See Attachment 2 for hit criteria for GBU-31/28, GBU-38, AGM-154/158, B-61/83,
   and Conventional Unguided weapons events.
5.3. CT Qualification. These criteria establish the minimum standards to maintain qualification
in the appropriate RAP-tasked weapons delivery events and do not necessarily determine
evaluation criteria established by other instructions or agencies (e.g., inspection/evaluation
teams). These qualifications are valid throughout the following training cycle. Qualification
criteria consist of the number of record releases listed in the RAP tasking message with an
overall hit rate of 50% in each weapon type: GBU-31/28, GBU-38, AGM-154/158, B-61/83,
and Conventional Unguided. WST scoring is not allowed for CT qualification.
   5.3.1. CT weapons deliveries will be tactical deliveries, to the maximum extent possible,
   simulating realistic employment of Unit Committed Munitions List (UCML) using published
   Dash-34 safe escape maneuvers, egress procedures, etc. Consideration should be given to
   appropriate fuzing options, probability of damage (PD), and safe separation criteria. CT air-
   to-surface weapons event requirements will be accomplished on scoreable tactical ranges to
 38                                                                 AFI11-2B-2V1 9 JUNE 2010


   the maximum extent possible. To maintain a combat perspective in a peacetime
   environment, weapons deliveries should simulate realistic employment of live
   munitions/Standard Conventional Load (SCL).
   5.3.2. Weapons qualification will be maintained by completing minimum number of record
   deliveries and also by achieving appropriate qualification percentage during the training
   cycle. DVR scoring may be used.
   5.3.3. Weapon qualification will be aligned with the squadron’s 12 month training cycle. At
   the end of the training cycle, weapons delivery scores will be reviewed to assess
   qualifications. If qualified, the pilot’s qualification is valid through the following training
   cycle.
5.4. Failure to Qualify. Failure to qualify in one event does not invalidate qualification in
others. SQ/CCs may declare a pilot/mission commander unqualified in an event(s) and
invalidate all previous record deliveries for that event at any time during a training cycle without
affecting other weapons event qualifications. If qualification is required at CMR, failure to
qualify will result in regression to N-CMR and entry into re-certification until re-qualification is
accomplished. Re-qualification is accomplished by achieving a hit rate of 50% or better on a
minimum of two record deliveries.
AFI11-2B-2V1 9 JUNE 2010                                                                    39

                                SPECIALIZED TRAINING

6.1. Ground Training Requirements. Ground training events accomplished in one training
program, and subsequently required for another training program, need not be re-accomplished
unless required by the SQ/CC. For example, conduct of flight briefings accomplished during
mission commander checkout is creditable to simulator instructor checkout. Annotate in the
individual training record when event is initially accomplished.
6.2. Aircraft Commander (AC) Upgrade. This program establishes minimum requirements
for upgrade to aircraft commander.
   6.2.1. Prerequisites:
       6.2.1.1. B2 IQT graduate.
       6.2.1.2. 1000 total hours (total time, not to include pilot training hours), or previous
       fighter 4-ship flight lead, or previous Major Weapons System (MWS) Aircraft
       Commander, or 200 post IQT B-2 hours and 40 RAP sorties.
       6.2.1.3. OG/CC is the waiver authority for entrance requirements.
   6.2.2. Upgrade Program:
       6.2.2.1. Squadron upgrade program managed through Training Program Management
       (TPM) process.
       6.2.2.2. Aircraft Commander will be accomplished IAW an OG/CC approved syllabus.
       As a minimum the following ground and flight training will include:
          6.2.2.2.1. Wingman responsibilities and unit training objectives.
          6.2.2.2.2. Mission Preparation: Mission objectives, Desired Learning Objectives
          (DLOs), currencies, capabilities, tactics, attack plan, and briefing preparation to

          use of briefing guides and audiovisual aids, briefing techniques, and
          debriefing/questioning techniques.
          6.2.2.2.4. Conduct of Missions: Flight discipline, emergency procedures, and training
          rules.
          6.2.2.2.5. One documented WST emphasizing emergency procedures, Cockpit/Crew
          Resource Management (CRM), and decision making.
          6.2.2.2.6. One documented flight in the right seat, as the lead of either a two or a
          three ship formation, emphasizing flight discipline, emergency procedures, and
          training rules, to be flown with an IP in the jet.
   6.2.3. Certification. Following successful completion of program requirements, the SQ/CC
   will personally interview the upgrading pilot and review responsibilities, scope of duties,
   authority, and philosophy. The SQ/CC will certify qualified status, including any
   restrictions, in appropriate written format (letter of X's, gradesheets, ARMS, etc.).
 40                                                               AFI11-2B-2V1 9 JUNE 2010


6.3. Formation Training. Formation training should place appropriate emphasis on tactical
employment. Initial Formation training will be conducted during IQT/MQT. In the event
formation training is not accomplished during IQT/MQT, an OG/CC approved training program
will be accomplished. RQT students previously formation qualified only require re-
familiarization with formation procedures. A flight as either lead or wing and thorough brief and
debrief of formation procedures meets this requirement.
   6.3.1. FLUG:
       6.3.1.1. FLUG will be accomplished IAW an OG/CC approved syllabus. As a minimum
       the following ground and flight training will include:
       6.3.1.2. Flight Lead (FL) Responsibilities.     FL/wingman relationship, unit training
       objectives.
       6.3.1.3. Mission Preparation. Mission objectives, DLOs, wingman requirements and
       responsibilities, currencies, capabilities, delegation of mission planning duties, tactics,
       attack plan, and briefing preparation to include IFEs and emergency diverts.
       6.3.1.4. Conduct of Flight Briefings and Debriefings. Objectives, DLOs, lessons
       learned, use of briefing guides and audiovisual aids, flight member involvement, briefing
       techniques, and debriefing/questioning techniques.

       training rules, broke lock procedures, and responsibilities to SQ/CC.
   6.3.2. FLUG training: Will include a minimum of two flights as the lead of either a two or
   a three ship formation. One WST focusing on FL techniques and responsibilities is required
   (federated desired). One flight will be flown in the right seat to meet the AC upgrade
   requirement. This flight must be flown with a SQ/CC approved supervisor and or IP in the
   jet. Upon successful completion of the AC upgrade ground training and flight, with SQ/CC
   approval, the upgradee can fly as an AC without completing the formation part of this
   training. The upgradee, however, will not be allowed to lead a formation until the two
   formation flights are completed (debrief included). Formation flights will be flown with
   SQ/CC approved supervisors and/or IPs in either the lead or wing aircraft.
   6.3.3. Certification. Following successful completion of program requirements, the SQ/CC
   will personally interview the upgrading pilot and review flight lead responsibilities, scope of
   duties, authority, and philosophy. The SQ/CC will certify the formation qualified status,
   including any restrictions, in appropriate written format (letter of X's, gradesheets, ARMS,
   etc.).
6.4. IPUG.
   6.4.1. IPUG prepares pilots for instructor qualification and is accomplished at the unit level
   IAW the OG/CC approved syllabus.
   6.4.2. IPUG training:
       6.4.2.1. As a minimum the syllabus will include three flights and a checkride focusing on
       conventional range operations, nuclear weapons employment, and guided weapons
       employment.

   6.4.3. Individuals selected for FTU instructor duty, must complete a separate FTC at the
   FTU.
   6.4.4. Entry requirements (waiverable by OG/CC): 1 year as aircraft commander and/or 100
   B-2 hours as an AC.
   6.4.5. Squadron commanders will decide which instructors are qualified to conduct IPUG
   training.
   6.4.6. Units will ensure graduates complete their initial instructor evaluation IAW AFI 11-
   202V2 and AFI 11-2B-2V2.
   6.4.7. Following satisfactory completion of upgrade requirements, the OG/CC will
   personally interview the upgrading IP and review IP responsibilities, scope of duties,
   authority and philosophy prior to the IP performing instructor duties.
6.5. MC Upgrade. This program establishes the minimum requirements for upgrade to MC.
WIC graduates are qualified as MCs.
   6.5.1. MC Responsibility: The MC is responsible for planning, coordinating, briefing,
   executing, and debriefing joint/composite force employment packages. MCs, once certified,
   are authorized to lead joint/composite force missions.
   6.5.2. MC Prerequisites: SQ/CCs/operations officers will consider judgment, technical
   expertise, experience, and unit weapons officer recommendations when selecting pilots for
   MC upgrade. MCs will be instructors or experienced ACs.

      6.5.3.8. AFTTP 3-1.General Planning (General Planning and Employment
      Considerations), AFTTP 3-1.Threat Guide (Threat Reference Guide and Countertactics),
      AFTTP 3-1.B-2 (Tactical Employment – B-2), and AFTTP 3-3.B-2 (Combat Aircraft
      Fundamentals – B-2) review.
      6.5.3.9. Integrated Air Defense Systems.
      6.5.3.10. Joint/Composite Force Integration.
   6.5.4. Flying Training. As a minimum, the MC candidate will plan, brief, fly, and debrief a
   minimum of one mission under the supervision of a unit weapons officer, SQ/DO or SQ/CC.
   File gradesheets and Training Accomplishment Reports (TARs) in the individual’s training
   folder.
 42                                                                  AFI11-2B-2V1 9 JUNE 2010


   6.5.5. Certification. Following satisfactory completion of the above requirements, the
   SQ/CC will certify the MC status, including any restrictions, in appropriate written format
   (letter of X’s, gradesheets, ARMS, etc.).
6.6. Pre-Deployment Spin-Up Training. This training will be conducted prior to deploying in
support of contingency operations (if time permits) or exercises. The objective of this training is
to ensure the pilot’s ability to conduct all missions in support of expected tasking. Tasked units
are responsible for contacting appropriate gaining command/operations to determine expected
mission tasking. Additionally, contact HQ AFGSC/A3X for site survey requirements. This
assures the responding forces are prepared for the appropriate tasking and allows the responding
OG/CC to tailor this training for the theater, threat, and tactics for the assigned task. The SQ/CC
is then responsible to implement this spin-up, prosecute the required missions, and determine the
specific requirements necessary to reach the desired level of proficiency. Emphasis will be
placed on training needed for missions not accomplished in daily operations. This training will
be conducted IAW all applicable regulations.
   6.6.1. Ground Training: Pilots will complete academic training prior to deployment. Units
   will brief ROE/Training Rules, command and control, engagement authority and procedures,
   SPINs, airspace restrictions, unique communications requirements, Emissions Control
   (EMCON) procedures, Operational Control (OPCON), and theater Order of Battle.
   Accomplish          a       review      of       the       Foreign     Clearance        Guide,
   https://www.fcg.pentagon.mil/fcg.cfm, for the unique procedures and requirements of the
   destination country. Additionally, this exercise will include a discussion of the airfield
   description and operating peculiarities. This review of the location’s unique operational
   environmental features should include but is not limited to inflight procedures, seasonal
   weather, other unique weather phenomena (e.g., space weather impacts), wind shear potential
   and characteristics (i.e., sea breeze front, low altitude jet stream potential, etc.), airfield
   restrictions, taxi routes, and operating data if available. The local weather flight can assist
   with weather training.
   6.6.2. Flying Training: Spin-up training will be tailored to ensure all deploying pilots are
   proficient, current, and qualified in all expected mission taskings.
6.7. Long-Duration Qualification Training. A one-time, long-duration B-2 WST (minimum

      6.8.2.2. Flight Training: One training sortie with a qualified instructor pilot to include:
          6.8.2.2.1. Fifteen minutes in position. This includes time spent inside one mile
          accomplishing a rejoin to the visual position.
          6.8.2.2.2. Minimum of two rejoins from the 60 degree echelon position to the
          observation position. Certification: Following satisfactory completion of the above
          requirements, the SQ/CC will certify the visual refueling qualification status;
          including any restrictions; in appropriate written format (letter of X’s, gradesheets,
          ARMS, etc.).

Terms
Academic Training—This training includes classroom, Computer Based Instruction (CBI), and
ATD related to aircraft systems and operation, flight characteristics and techniques, performance,
normal and emergency procedures, and safety of flight items. Academic courses prepare crew
members for flight training and are normally completed before flight training.
Aircraft Commander (AC)—The individual qualified to perform B-2 aircrew duties,
designated on the Flight Authorization as the pilot responsible for the safe and efficient conduct
of flight operations.
Aircraft Handling Characteristics (AHC)—Training for proficiency in utilization and
exploitation of the aircraft flight envelope, consistent with operational and safety constraints,
including, but not limited to high/maximum angle of attack (AOA) maneuvering, energy
management, minimum time turns, maximum/optimum acceleration and deceleration techniques
and confidence maneuvers (AFI 11-214).
Aircrew Training Device (ATD)—The ATD is intended to enhance, not replace actual flight
training. ATDs do this by allowing aircrew to practice tactics, malfunctions, and emergency
procedures which cannot be practiced inflight. ATD missions must be designed to ensure that
the prescribed subject matter is presented in a realistic manner that resembles to the maximum
extent possible actual flight procedures, tactics, and threat environments.
Attrition Sortie—a replacement sortie to allow for expected losses due to maintenance,
operations, supply, air traffic control, sympathy, HHQ, weather, and other cancels. Attrition
sorties are not substitutes for capability shortfalls; they are additive to the contract to ensure
mission goals are met. Sorties are planned and launched as a RAP training sortie, Non-RAP
sortie, or collateral sortie. It is imperative that units log these sorties properly. Improper
accounting of these sorties will result in improper sortie allocation, stresses to the unit schedule,
and negative impacts to the quality of unit training programs.
Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ)—A status of an aircrew member who has satisfactorily
completed training prescribed to maintain the skills necessary to fly the unit aircraft. The
member must perform at the minimum frequency necessary to meet the most recent sortie and
flight standards set for the weapons system. BAQ will only be carried by aircrew until
completion of MQT. BAQ is not a permanent qualification except for General Officers above
the wing level, and any other crew members specifically authorized by MAJCOM A3.
Basic Mission Capable (BMC)—The status of an aircrew who has satisfactorily completed
training (MQT) prescribed to be fully qualified to perform the basic unit operational missions but
does not maintain CMR status. Aircrew accomplishes training required to remain familiarized in
all, and may be qualified and proficient in some, of the primary missions of their weapon system
and unit. These aircrew members may also maintain special capabilities (Refer to paragraph
4.3.4.).
Certification—The process of certifying aircrew tactical employment and special weapons
capabilities, procedures, and rules. Replaces verification for nuclear tasked units.
 54                                                               AFI11-2B-2V1 9 JUNE 2010


Circular Error—Miss distance of a given weapon impact expressed in radial distance from
center of target.
Cockpit Procedures Trainer (CPT)—A training device in which instruments and displays are
activated to respond to trainee inputs. Used for safety of flight, instrument, normal, and
emergency procedures (see AFP 50-11 [AFPAM 36-2211]).
Collateral Sorties—Sorties not directly related to combat employment or basic skills training
but necessary for accomplishment of unit training programs, such as ferry flights, deployments,
instructor sortie, incentive flights, orientation flights, airshows, etc. MAJCOMs will normally
assign collateral sorties in lump sum, adjusted for local conditions and circumstances. These
sorties are not required for RAP training purposes.
Combat Mission Ready (CMR)—The status of an aircrew member who has satisfactorily
completed training (MQT) prescribed to be fully qualified to perform the basic unit operational
missions, and maintains qualification and proficiency in these missions. All active duty API-1/2,
Squadron Commanders, Operations Officers, and OG/CC designated API-6 manning positions
are required to maintain this qualification level. EXCEPTION: If a unit is over-manned, they
may elect to train the front line of their UMD to CMR with the overage designated as BMC.
Approximately 50% of the pilots selected for CMR must be inexperienced (Refer to paragraph
4.3.).
Companion Trainer Program (CTP)—Designed to augment the limited flying opportunity
afforded B-2 pilots and select wing support pilots, honing airmanship by flying sorties in the T-
38 IAW AFI 11-2T/AT-38V3, T/AT-38--Operations Procedures.
Continuation Training (CT)—Training to maintain proficiency and improve aircrew
capabilities to perform unit missions and aircrew proficiency sorties not flown in formal syllabus
missions, tests, or evaluations. Applicable to CMR and BMC aircrew.
Currency—The minimum frequency required to perform an event or sortie safely.
Delivery Parameters—Data reflecting current delivery considerations for conventional and
nuclear ordnance as well as tactical survivability. Appropriate aircraft/weapons Tech Orders
must be consulted for live ordnance safe escape criteria and 1B-2A-1-1 performance charts for
recovery altitudes.
Desired Learning Objectives (DLO)—Objectives set by the sortie’s package commander
intended for use as learning progress benchmarks. DLOs should be understandable, attainable,
and quantifiable. Accomplishment of desired learning objectives will indicate mission success
on training missions via completion of specific mission tasks. An example DLO would read,
"Determine spacing requirement for formation bombing in high altitude formation." The
corresponding mission task would read, "Perform a target direct bomb run."
DNIF—Duty Not Involving Flying
EC Event (Air-to-Air [A/A])—The aircrew detects an airborne threat via electronic means and
reacts with appropriate maneuvers. Airborne threat training will be accomplished only with a
dedicated adversary attacking from beyond visual range.
EC Event (Air-to-Surface [A/S])—The aircrew detects a surface threat via electronic or
simulated means and reacts with appropriate maneuvers.
AFI11-2B-2V1 9 JUNE 2010                                                                     55

                                  EVENTS DESCRIPTIONS

A2.1. Event Descriptions: Unless otherwise specified in these event descriptions, units will
determine the necessary parameters for fulfilling and/or logging tasked events. Event is defined
in one of the following manners:
   A2.1.1. A specific type of weapon delivery (defined by aircraft flight path, ordnance
   delivered, delivery method, or target struck) performed during a sortie.
   A2.1.2. Expending of ordinance against a target according to predetermined flight path
   parameters and delivery methods. A single delivery constitutes an event.
   A2.1.3. Accomplishment of a specific training element, function, or task (i.e., Air Refueling,
   Precision Approach, etc.).
A2.2. Weapons Delivery Events:
   A2.2.1. A delivery is defined as a pass at a target on which ordnance is expended or meets
   the criteria defining a specific weapon delivery. All deliveries will be recorded, but not
   necessarily as a "record" delivery. A delivery constitutes a weapons delivery event based on
   two categories: By record keeping (Record or Non-record) and by RAP tasking
   (Familiarization (FAM) and Qualification (QUAL)).
   A2.2.2. Record Keeping:
       A2.2.2.1. Non-Record. Basic or Tactical weapons delivery accomplishments not
       credited toward weapons qualification provided the crewmember declares non-record
       prior to beginning the event.
       A2.2.2.2. Record. Conventional or nuclear delivery scored for individual weapons
       qualification. Scoring shall be accomplished by ground, TOSS, DVR, or WST (initial
       qualification only) as appropriate. For a DVR scored record delivery to count as a hit, it
       must be scored by a weapons officer or a SQ/CC designated individual. A maximum of
       two record deliveries may be accomplished during a sortie using the same release offsets.
       Additional record deliveries may be accomplished from headings differing by at least 45
       degrees or on different targets/ ranges or using different release offsets. Record
       deliveries may not be preceded by non-record deliveries in the same event on the same
       sortie. The first two deliveries will be considered record unless otherwise declared prior
       to the roll-in to final. Scores will be documented by range and bearing from the desired
       impact point. For a multiple guided weapons release, each individual Desired Mean
       Point of Impact (DMPI) counts as a record release. Radar aiming must be accomplished
       for all record releases (N/A for standoff record releases and actual releases). This does
       not imply that the system must be updated (i.e. move the cursor), only that the
       opportunity to update the system via offset or target direct aiming is available. All actual
       weapon releases will be counted as record releases.
   A2.2.3. Hit Criteria:
       A2.2.3.1. Stand off Weapons Record and Actual Release scoring criteria: Weapons
       score is ascertained by TOSS/Range Control Officer, video tape recorder (VTR)/DVR
AFI11-2B-2V1 9 JUNE 2010                                                                         59


     assessment or WST scoring system. Hit criteria (actual or simulated): effective release of
     one or more weapons within correct parameters to include correct coordinates, proper
     target file/weapons edit settings, attained release parameters, and appropriate malfunction
     analysis/corrective action.
     A2.2.3.2. Guided Weapons Record and Actual Release scoring criteria: Weapons
     score is ascertained by TOSS/Range Control Officer, DVR assessment or WST scoring
     system. Hit criteria is based on authorized evaluation of aiming, navigation system
     integrity and system buffers. Aiming must be within two radar pixels of DMPI for DVR
     scoring. Guided weapon deliveries with multiple DMPIs will score each DMPI
     individually.
     A2.2.3.3. Unguided Weapons Record and Actual Release scoring criteria: Weapons
     score is ascertained by TOSS/Range Control Officer, DVR assessment or WST scoring
     system. For a weapons pass made at 5,000 ft Above Ground Level (AGL) or below, the
     hit criteria is less than or equal to 150 feet or desired weapons effects, whichever is less.
     For a weapons pass made above 5,000 ft AGL, the hit criteria is less than or equal to 250
     feet or desired weapons effects, whichever is less. For simulated releases, aiming must
     be within 2 radar pixels of the desired aimpoint (either offset or target direct), and aircraft
     within weapons parameters to be counted as a hit.
     A2.2.3.4. Weapons Record and Actual Release scoring criteria: All weapons
     releases, actual and simulated, that are suspected as misses will be documented and
     forwarded to the applicable SQ/DOW for review. SQ/DOW will determine if the miss
     was the result of aircrew error. If the miss is the result of aircrew error, it will be
     annotated as a miss and count against the aircrew for weapons qualification. If SQ/DOW
     determines that the miss was not due to aircrew error, it will be annotated as non-aircrew
     attributable and will not count against them for weapons qualification.
  A2.2.4. RAP Tasking:
     A2.2.4.1. FAM. Weapons events tasked as FAM may be record deliveries. Each single
     bomb run counts as one delivery. Unless otherwise specified in the RAP Tasking Memo
     or formal course syllabi, FAM tasking normally requires a minimum of five weapon
     deliveries per delivery type.
     A2.2.4.2. QUAL. Weapons tasked at QUAL must be record deliveries. QUAL tasking
     demonstrates the pilot’s capability to put appropriate ordnance on target. Unless
     otherwise specified in the RAP Tasking Memo or formal course syllabi, QUAL criteria is
     established for each event in Chapter 5.
  A2.2.5. Definitions:    Miscellaneous Weapons Delivery definitions to be considered for
  event descriptions.
     A2.2.5.1. Dry Pass. Weapons delivery pass during which no ordnance is expended.
     Such dry passes prior to completion of record deliveries in an event are charged to the
     crewmember as gross errors. Unless pass was dry because of safety interests, system
     malfunctions, basic delivery requirements, required by range regulation or Air Force
     directive, or directed for flight integrity purposes which were not due to aircrew error will
     be considered as a dry pass and will not count as a record release delivery.
 60                                                               AFI11-2B-2V1 9 JUNE 2010


       A2.2.5.2. Foul. A penalty directed to a specific aircraft and crew for actions inconsistent
       with established procedures or safety considerations. A foul will result in a gross error
       for that delivery. Verbal warnings will not be substituted for fouls. A second foul or any
       dangerous pass will result in mandatory expulsion from any further deliveries during that
       mission and a gross error score for the event. A foul will be charged IAW flying
       directive publications.
       A2.2.5.3. Gross Error. A penalty score or miss assigned to a pilot’s/mission
       commander's records when a weapons delivery attempt results in: munitions impact
       outside the range scoring capability, a chargeable dry pass, a foul, or an unintentional
       release.
       A2.2.5.4. Hit. Predicated upon achieving the desired Probability of Damage per target
       type and number/type of weapons as defined by JMEM documents.
       A2.2.5.5. Multiple Release. More than one weapon released against the same target on
       a single pass.
       A2.2.5.6. Inadvertent. Ordnance which was released without command by the aircrew.
       Impact will not be scored.
       A2.2.5.7. System Malfunction. An undeclared multiple release caused by a verified
       system malfunction. Score is void after system malfunction verification, otherwise,
       unintentional rules apply.
       A2.2.5.8. Unintentional. Ordnance released due to aircrew error. Will be scored as
       gross error regardless of impact point.
       A2.2.5.9. No Spot. A weapons release during which no impact was observed. No score
       or error will be assigned.
       A2.2.5.10. Void Delivery. Weapons delivery not successfully completed due to: a
       documented and verified weapons system malfunction, a pass aborted for safety, no spot,
       or circumstances beyond the control of the aircrew.

                                         Attachment 4
                             LONG ENDURANCE TRAINING

A4.1. General. Long Duration sorties are defined in Attachment 1. Long Duration missions
are not intended to be a crew training requirement only, but rather a requirement for the entire
unit, allowing each part of the warfighting team an opportunity to gain valuable experience. The
benefit of these missions is to provide units with practice in joint operations, foreign country
coordination, non-standard mission planning and range activities, international flight planning,
physiological aspects of long duration flights, aircraft phase flow, weapons load training, and
Operations Security (OPSEC).
A4.2. Command Relations. The execution order for HHD missions will specify command
relations. Units coordinating their own long duration training must make their own
arrangements. Contact AFGSC/A3X for assistance if required. For most training missions
OPCON will remain with CDRUSJFCOM. The combatant commander has TACON for
exercises purposes whenever forces not assigned to that combatant commander undertake
exercises in the combatant commander’s AOR. TACON begins when the forces enter the AOR,
and is terminated at the completion of the exercise after departing the AOR. TACON provides
direct authority over exercising forces for purposes relating to that exercise only; it does not
authorize operational employment of those forces. Specified elements of ADCON (force
protection and concurrent UCMJ authority) are also granted to the combatant commander for
deployment/diverts into the AOR. The preceding command relation guidance also applies to
Global Power missions.
A4.3. Public Affairs. Many long duration missions will attract media attention, and this is
encouraged. All public affairs questions should be routed to the Office of Public Affairs, HQ
AFGSC/PA, DSN 574-5007.
A4.4. Crew Rest and Flight Duty Limitations.
   A4.4.1. Crew Rest: Aircrew and DNIF cover aircrew will be identified no later than 72
   hours prior to launch. The aircrew will be relieved of non-mission related duties 48 hours
   prior to launch. Units will consider using preflight crews to minimize crew duty day. Post-
   flight crew rest should be proportionate to the length of the flight duty period. Longer flight
   duty periods will require longer crew rest periods. For all long duration sorties post-flight
   rest requirement is a minimum of 24 hours, plus one half hour for every time zone crossed in
   flight.
   A4.4.2. Maximum Flight Duty Period: Maximum flight duty period for all sorties is
   defined in AFI 11-202V3, Table 9.1 and AFGSC Sup 1. For HHD missions including
   Global Power missions, the approved EXORD constitutes approval to exceed these duty day
   limitations as required to accomplish the mission unless a maximum duty day is specified in
   the EXORD. For non-HHD missions units must request a duty day waiver from AFGSC/A3
   if required.
   A4.4.3. Units are encouraged to use any reasonable means to shorten an extended crew duty
   day, such as using preflight crews, minimizing show times, etc. Additionally, during the
   planning of long duration missions, planners should review time over targets (TOTs) and the
   way in which these will impact aircraft launch and recovery times. Every attempt should be
 80                                                                AFI11-2B-2V1 9 JUNE 2010


   made to minimize conflict with crew circadian rhythms. Where possible, avoid scheduling
   critical phases of flight during normal sleep periods (such as 2300 through 0600 hours home-
   base time).
A4.5. Human Factors/Physiological Issues.
   A4.5.1. Unit planners will contact unit flight surgeons upon initiation of planning. Factors
   to be considered include pre- and post-flight crew rest, use of medication, required human
   factors briefings and scheduling of inflight activities. The unit flight surgeon will act as
   liaison with Air Force Research Laboratory and request on scene assistance as needed. The
   mission fatigue timeline and other related aircrew fatigue management documents may
   function as source documents for guidance.
   A4.5.2. Unit flight surgeons will ensure medications (Go Pills) are used IAW current
   AF/A3/5 and AFGSC/A3/SG message guidance and HQ AFGSC/SG guidelines.
   A4.5.3. Unit flight surgeons will also ensure aircrews receive briefings on human
   performance and physiological issues related to long duration missions.
   A4.5.4. The OSS wing flight equipment officer will develop a long duration flight
   equipment package (i.e. noise reduction headsets, piddle packs, mattress, sleeping bag, etc.).
   Use of quick-don masks is authorized to satisfy AFI 11-202V3, oxygen requirements for long
   duration flights. Use of long duration flight equipment, to include quick-don oxygen masks,
   is restricted to periods of high altitude cruise flight. Ejection seat requirements for high
   altitude cruise removal of parachute/torso harness in AFI 11-202V3, must be complied with.
   A4.5.5. It is highly recommended that units contact Air Force Research Laboratory,
   Biodynamics and Protection Division (DSN 240-8140) for missions exceeding 24 hours. The
   Biodynamics and Protection Division can provide a mission fatigue management timeline.
   The timeline will provide information on sleep/wake cycles and light (night/ day) levels
   expected for route of flight. Requirements for the timeline are latitudes and longitudes of
   route of flight, T/O and land times, AR times, and low altitude times faxed to them (DSN
   240-2761) at least 24 hours in advance (do not send sensitive data).
A4.6. Theater Instructions. The following entry/exit procedures will be used by all bomber
aircraft operating in the specified AOR. They should help minimize inflight communications.
These procedures do not replace any required exercise-specific reporting instructions.
   A4.6.1. EUCOM AOR: The following procedure will be used by aircrew employing to or
   transiting the EUCOM AOR. Crossing 45W longitude eastbound, aircrew will check in via
   CTII, VSAT or establish a phone patch via HF radio (or other suitable means) with the 32
   AOC, (DSN 314-478-8831/4156/) call sign: WOLFHOUND at Ramstein Air Base,
   Germany. Pass in-flight report to include, time of crossing, aircraft status, and ETA to target.
   The 32 AOC will provide a weather update and confirm range availability if within the
   EUCOM AOR. This does not replace the need to communicate directly with the specific
   range for final confirmation and for the aircrew to comply with all range procedures. Keep
   the 32 AOC advised of any deviations to the original planned operation (use of an alternate
   range, weather divert, etc.). Contact the 32 AOC passing longitude 45W westbound to
   CONUS with an in-flight Mission Report (MISREP). If unsuccessful, pass reason. If exiting
   eastbound/ entering westbound, make exit/entry report at 30E longitude to the 32 AOC.
AFI11-2B-2V1 9 JUNE 2010                                                                     81


  Units will coordinate with the 16 AF AOC NLT 7 business days prior to mission launch to
  confirm and coordinate the mission SPINS.
  A4.6.2. PACOM AOR: Upon entering the PACOM AOR, aircrew will contact the Kenney
  Headquarters Pacific Air & Space Operations Center (PAOC) directly or via phone patch
  through the AFGSC Command Center (DSN 574-XXXX) with an advisory on mission
  status, intentions, and other pertinent information. The PAOC will pass along information or
  provide assistance as required in support of the mission (weather, range status, message
  relay, etc.). The same procedure will apply when the missions leave the AOR. Units will call
  the PAOC 24/7 Chief of Combat Operations (CCO) at DSN 315-448-0844 or Comm (808)
  448-0844 on mission planning day to confirm the impending mission and obtain PAOC
  contact information.
  A4.6.3. CENTCOM: The following procedure will be used when employing in or transiting
  the CENTCOM AOR. Two weeks prior to the mission, the unit POC will contact the
  CENTCOM POC (CCJ3-P (non-JCS Exercise) DSN 968-6340 or CCJ3-E (JCS Exercise)
  DSN 968-6298) to detail command and control authority and specific communication
  requirements (call sign of controlling agency, SATCOM frequencies, DSN #, and number of
  reports required). Contact the CAOC SODO (DSN 318 436-4293) via HF radio (or other
  suitable means) upon entry and exit of the CENTCOM AOR and continuously monitor
  directed frequencies throughout the mission. Ensure you report aircraft status, location, and
  any other pertinent information. The controlling agency will pass along information as
  required that may apply to the mission (weather, range status, etc.).                 Contact
  CENTCOM/CCJ3, DSN 968-6340/6298 (FAX: 968-5829) on mission planning day to
  confirm the impending mission and coordinate details.
  A4.6.4. SOUTHCOM: The following procedures will be used for aircrew employing to or
  transiting the SOUTHCOM AOR. Amplifying information can be found on the AFSOUTH
  SIPRNET website http://12af.davismonthan.af.smil.mil/ussouthaf/. NLT 30 days prior to
  the mission, the unit POC will contact the AFSOUTH A3X (DSN 228-0209/7355) to conduct
  initial coordination. Simultaneously, the aircrew will also contact the AFSOUTH CAOC
  MAAP Cell (DSN 228-2065/5968) to coordinate inclusion in the AFSOUTH ATO and any
  other CAOC issues. During mission planning day the aircrew should contact the AFSOUTH
  CAOC Duty Officer (DSN 228-5029/5974) to get further updates/restrictions, coordinate
  details and to confirm the mission. Upon crossing 29N latitude southbound, 95W longitude
  eastbound or 20E longitude westbound, aircrew will establish contact on AFSOUTH C2 nets
  IAW procedures outlined in the AFSOUTH Special Instructions, Appendix 1
  ―Communications and Frequency Assignments‖. Aircrews should continuously monitor
  directed frequencies throughout the mission and will report aircraft status, location, and any
  other pertinent information. The controlling agency will pass along information as required
  that may apply to the mission (weather, base/range status, etc.).
  A4.6.5. NORTHCOM AOR: Follow ICAO/FAR procedures for entering/exiting the North
  American Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ).
  A4.6.6. OTHER AORs: There is no preferred procedure for entering and exiting other
  AORs. It is highly dependent on the individual country being entered and the exercise.
  Expect instructions from the specific unified command HQ on the specific entry/exit
  procedures.
 82                                                               AFI11-2B-2V1 9 JUNE 2010


A4.7. Global Power Program. Global Power is the unclassified nickname for HQ AFGSC-
tasked bomber out-of CONUS long-range conventional strike deployment-employment
capabilities needed to respond to the spectrum of Air Expeditionary Force engagement scenarios.
Global Power by itself is unclassified, although the exercises it is connected with may be
classified.
   A4.7.1. Office of Primary Responsibility is HQ AFGSC/A3X, 841 Fairchild Ave, Building
   5541, Barksdale AFB, LA 71110, DSN 781-0323.                    E-mail address is
   AFGSCA3Xworkflow@barksdale.af.mil.
   A4.7.2. The following requirements are the minimum training events needed to receive
   credit for a Global Power mission. The requirements are based on likely power projection
   scenarios to support Air Expeditionary Force taskings that must respond across the spectrum
   of engagement options.
       A4.7.2.1. Each unit must launch a sortie that is planned to transit international airspace,
       enter another combatant commander’s AOR, accomplish an ADIZ penetration, and then
       strike targets on an overseas range, depending on the deployment-employment scenario.
       Mission planning should include multiple targets in a medium to high threat environment
       and varied mission tasks.
       A4.7.2.2. Each sortie must be a minimum of 13 hours to ensure the crew’s experience
       the physiological effect of long duration flight. The length of the Global Power mission
       will depend upon the actual overseas range and the employment/deployment scenario. It
       is highly desirable to release live weapons for every Global Power mission. There are
       times that Global Power training can be accomplished without releasing live weapons if
       the mission complexity would make live weapons release impractical. Waiver authority
       for live releases resides with BW/CC.
       A4.7.2.3. Inflight planning re-planning and target reassignment. Flexibility is a key
       ingredient to Global Power mission profiles. Each unit must be prepared to conduct
       airborne re-planning and target reassignment to the maximum extent possible.
       A4.7.2.4. Global Command, Control and Communication Systems. HQ AFGSC will
       exercise "real world" command relations to the maximum extent possible (refer to A4.2
       for basic guidelines). Ensure all communication systems available (Voice SATCOM,
       HPW, LINK-16, BLOS, and other secure communication systems) are exercised on all
       Global Power training sorties as much as practical.
A4.8. Mission Options: The following options reflect the most likely use of bombers across the
spectrum of engagement: Round-robin missions: bombers launch from home station, conduct
an employment mission to an overseas range, then land at home station. This option is the most
demanding on aircrew and air refueling assets. Deployment-employment missions: bombers
launch from the CONUS, release weapons on an overseas range, then land at a bomber FOL.
Higher headquarters directed deployments: All JCS directed missions, combatant commander
request for forces (participation in the EUCOM, PACOM, SOUTHCOM, or CENTCOM AOR),
and JCS exercise deployment sorties en route to overseas location, regardless of mission profile,
will be considered Global Power missions.
AFI11-2B-2V1 9 JUNE 2010                                                                     83


A4.9. Funding: AFGSC/A3X manages Global Power missions and has the authorization to
fund TDY, per diem, and billeting costs of operation and maintenance personnel supporting the
mission.
A4.10. Scheduling: HQ AFGSC/A3X will schedule, coordinate, and manage all Global Power
missions. It will interface with overseas MAJCOMs, numbered air forces, and individual
bomber units. Presently, Global Power taskings are contained in the AFGSC CPO. Due to the
dynamic nature of many exercises, dates may change, but this annual schedule will provide the
framework units need to plan and will be changed only IAW the process identified in the
AFGSC CPO. If a unit has an alternative plan they would like to execute in a particular quarter,
they should inform A3X with adequate lead-time so that proper coordination may proceed.
Global Power missions that require short-notice airlift/inflight refueling must be avoided. A3X
will schedule each bomber squadron for a minimum of two Global Power missions per AEF
cycle in the CPO. It is recommended that one of the two Global Power missions be scheduled to
occur within three months of AEF vulnerability. Participation in higher headquarters overseas
exercises also qualifies for Global Power credit.
A4.11. Individual Bomber Unit Responsibilities:
   A4.11.1. Units will develop local guidance and procedures for all aspects of Global Power
   missions. Appoint an OSS primary and alternate POC to interface with HQ AFGSC on all
   long duration/Global Power matters. Ensure A3X has a current name, message address, DSN
   number, and E-mail address (if applicable) for the OSS POC. All unit contact with A3X will
   be coordinated through the OSS POC. Units will also designate a primary and alternate
   project officer for each Global Power /long duration mission to ensure proper coordination
   and information flow between all concerned. Both primary and alternate project officers
   must maintain total working knowledge of all aspects of their assigned mission. Maintain
   HQ AFGSC/A3X as ―info‖ addressee on all message traffic associated with Global Power.
   Similarly info the concerned overseas MAJCOM and parent NAF. Normally, units will work
   range requests, fighter intercepts, Electronic Countermeasures (ECM), and so on, through the
   exercise office of the particular overseas MAJCOM. Range guide information is available
   from other MAJCOM exercise offices or HQ AFGSC/A3X to assist in planning for overseas
   range use.
   A4.11.2. Units will consult the AFGSC CPO to determine the type of exercise the Global
   Power mission will support (i.e. JCS, MAJCOM, etc.) in order to ensure the correct Air
   Refueling Support Priority (IAW AFI 11-221, Air Refueling Management (KC-10 and KC-
   135), Attachment 1) can be assigned. Contact A3X if there is any question on the priority
   level to be assigned.
   A4.11.3. ―Horseblanket‖ requests are critical to ensure air refueling will happen where and
   when needed. Short-notice tanker requests should be avoided to the maximum extent
   possible. Unit will ensure they submit tanker requests with the proper priority level IAW AFI
   11-221, Attachment 1. ―Horseblanket‖ scheduling is normally due the last week of the first
   month of the quarter for the following quarter. The following is a guideline for
   ―Horseblanket‖ air refueling requests:
       A4.11.3.1. Jan thru Mar Global Power missions: request air refueling support the third
       week in October.
84                                                              AFI11-2B-2V1 9 JUNE 2010


     A4.11.3.2. Apr thru Jun Global Power missions: request air refueling support the third
     week in January.
     A4.11.3.3. Jul thru Sep Global Power missions: request air refueling support the third
     week in April.
     A4.11.3.4. Oct thru Dec Global Power missions: request air refueling support the third
     week in July.
     A4.11.3.5. Because Global Power missions are tanker-intensive, units should consider
     any and all options to reduce the inflight refueling requirements.
  A4.11.4. Units will consult/comply with the DOD Foreign Clearance Guide and AFGSC/CC
  OMNIBUS Plan - 96 for applicable guidance.
  A4.11.5. Unit Intel Office will submit a threat advisory support request message IAW
  AFGSCI 14-250 NLT 10 working days prior to launch date. Unit Intel personnel will become
  familiar with procedures listed in the most recent edition of this instruction as well any
  published guidance detailing advisory support procedures.
  A4.11.6. Units may explore options to use if the mission cannot be accomplished as planned.
  However, alternate missions should be kept as simple as possible due to the complexity of
  the primary mission. Training events will be limited to the minimum required to accomplish
  the specific mission taskings and operational training.
  A4.11.7. Provide a detailed summary of planned employment activity to A3X NLT 3 weeks
  before the sortie date. This information may be provided via fax or e-mail to make the three-
  week suspense. However, ensure both HQ AFGSC and the parent NAF get the same
  information. Unit POCs will also contact HQ AFGSC/A3X 48 hours prior to mission launch
  to update the three-week report. This may be done via telecom, fax, or e-mail. This
  summary will include:
     A4.11.7.1. Date of launch (local date)
     A4.11.7.2. Takeoff time (Zulu and local times)
     A4.11.7.3. Landing time (Zulu and local times, and date)
     A4.11.7.4. Landing location, if not home station
     A4.11.7.5. Duration
     A4.11.7.6. Number of aircraft in formation
     A4.11.7.7. Number of airborne/ground spares
     A4.11.7.8. Weapons carried: Type and number
     A4.11.7.9. All activity planned; include bombing altitude and weapon tactics, fighter or
     ECM activity, etc.
     A4.11.7.10. Range name/location
     A4.11.7.11. Target number and TOT (Zulu and local times, and date)
     A4.11.7.12. Threat Advisory Support Activity, actual and simulated
     A4.11.7.13. Emergency/divert fields
AFI11-2B-2V1 9 JUNE 2010                                                                       85


     A4.11.7.14. Air refueling information: Number of times; pounds onloaded per aircraft
     per refueling; tanker unit and type; A/R tracks; each ARIP.
     A4.11.7.15. Route description (general verbal description of the route to facilitate
     development of a briefing slide).
     A4.11.7.16. Return mission information if deploying (Same format as above).
  A4.11.8. Inflight reports must be made to the unit command post. These reports, as a
  minimum, will include a takeoff report, end air refueling report, a strike report, and a landing
  report. Also, a report will be made anytime unplanned circumstances significantly affect the
  outcome of the mission, such as inflight emergency, divert, release system malfunction,
  weather, navigation problems, and so on. Crew judgment is the key when deciding what
  needs to be reported. The unit command post will relay all inflight reports to the HQ AFGSC
  Command Post, who will then up-channel reports to the AFGSC/A3. For United States Air
  Forces in Europe (USAFE) AOR ask your command center to forward any pertinent
  information to the 603 AOC, (DSN 314-478-8831/4156/) call sign: WOLFHOUND at
  Ramstein Air Base, Germany.
  A4.11.9. Within 3 days after the mission, a call must be made to A3X with a verbal report
  on the mission. This is not an official after-action report but a generalized ―how it went‖
  briefing. All information on the pre-mission (3-week) report should be updated with the
  actual mission results to include threat advisory support results. EXCEPTION: if anything
  occurs during the mission that needs to be briefed to the AFGSC Staff (diversion, emergency,
  diplomatic incident, etc.), call AFGSC Command Center, DSN 574-1555, immediately. If in
  doubt, call.
