1. Mission.
     1.1. 320 AEW AFFOR Operations Center (Ops Ctr), combined with the 320 AEW
     Command Element, serves as the Air Force Component Headquarters to Joint Task Force-
     National Capital Region (JTF-NCR). The Ops Ctr functions similar to an Air Operations
     Center (AOC) and maintains situational awareness and oversight of ground Air Force forces
     (AFFOR) and assets for missions and events within the NCR and generates predictive
     battlespace awareness. The Ops Ctr coordinates with AF/A3OO (AFOG), AFNORTH
     (1AF), JFHQ-NCR / JTF-NCR Joint Operations Center (JOC), other NCR-based Service and
     Joint planning groups, or inter-agency Operations Centers, as required. The 320 AEW
     AFFOR Ops Ctr also functions as an A Staff by exercising ADCON of Air Force forces
     assigned or attached to JTF-NCR.
        1.1.1. The requirement for an Air Force Service Component Headquarters (HQ) as part
        of a JTF is established in Joint Publication 1, Doctrine for the Armed Forces of the
        United States. The National Capital Region AFFOR Ops Ctr requirement is established
        in US Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) CONPLAN 3600, Emergency
        Preparedness in the National Capital Region and the HQ 1 AIR AND SPACE
        EXPEDITIONARY TASK FORCE (1AETF) STANDING OPORD FOR 320 AEW-
        NCR OPERATIONS.
     1.2. The Ops Ctr will typically be activated IAW CONPLAN 3600 whenever the JTF-NCR
     is activated by USNORTHCOM. Air Force forces identified as Initial Operating Forces
     (IOF) for supporting the JTF-NCR, to include the AFFOR Ops Ctr forces, will be presented
     to the CDR JTF-NCR as the 320 AEW. This presentation of forces as an Air Expeditionary
     Force is IAW Air Force Doctrine Document 1, Air Force Basic Doctrine and Air Force
     Doctrine Document 2, Operations and Organizations.
        1.2.1. The current Unit Type Code (UTC) for the Air Force IOF in support of
        CONPLAN 3600 designates AFDW as the initial source for all these forces (see UTC
AFDWI10-2 15 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                  3


      CTJNC). These forces will be assigned to the 320 AEW for presentation to the supported
      operational commander, the CDR JTF-NCR. Once forces are assigned to the 320 AEW
      and presented to the JTF-NCR, the Commander JTF-NCR will typically have Operational
      Control (OPCON) of these forces.
   1.3. The AFFOR Ops Ctr may also be activated by the AFDW/CC or designated
   representative to support events/operations other than as specified by CONPLAN 3600.
   When the Ops Ctr is activated this way by the AFDW/CC, the forces performing Ops Ctr
   duties remain part of AFDW and are not assigned to the 320 AEW. OPCON is retained by
   the AFDW/CC.
2. Organizations.
   2.1. Air Force District of Washington (AFDW). AFDW is a Direct Reporting Unit (DRU)
   to the Chief of Staff, USAF, and serves as the Air Force Service component of Joint Forces

   conducts Homeland Operations in the NCR. AFDW is the designated single Air Force voice
   for planning and implementing Air Force and AF-led joint solutions concerning the NCR.
   AFDW comprises the HQ staff, 11 WG, 79 MDW and 844 CG.
   2.2. Joint Forces Headquarters National Capital Region (JFHQ-NCR). JFHQ-NCR
   supports USNORTHCOM as an operational level, regionally focused headquarters. The
   purpose of the JFHQ is to plan and prepare for operations in the NCR on behalf of CDR
   USNORTHCOM. When directed, JFHQ-NCR transitions to JTF-NCR and assumes control
   of forces assigned to conduct Homeland Operations in the NCR Joint Operating Area (JOA).
   The Commander JTF-NCR will be the supported operational commander in the NCR JOA.
   2.3. 320th Air Expeditionary Wing (320 AEW). The 320 AEW is the Air Force
   component of JTF-NCR. IAW the HQ 1 Air and Space Expeditionary Task Force (1AETF)
   standing OPORD for the 320 AEW, USAF forces that are assigned or attached OPCON to
   JTF-NCR will be ADCON to the 320 AEW.
      2.3.1. CONPLAN 3600 identifies baseline Initial Operating Forces (IOF). IAW USAF
      doctrine, these forces will be part of the 320 AEW.
      2.3.2. The AFDW/CC is the designated 320 AEW/CC and COMAFFOR-FWD IAW Air
      Force Mission Directive (MD) 13.
      2.3.3. The AFDW Mobilization Assistant (MA) is the Vice Commander of the 320 AEW
      IAW AFDW MD 131.
      2.3.4. If additional units are required to support operations in the NCR, pre-designated
      Air Expeditionary Groups have been reserved by 1AF/A1RM to be assigned under the
      320 AEW.
   2.4. Joint Task Force National Capital Region Medical (JTF CapMed). JTF CapMed is
   a standing Joint Task Force tasked to provide medical support within the NCR. AFDW is the
   supporting command to JTF CapMed. 79 MDW forces support JTF CapMed operations and
   are Tactical Control (TACON) to JTF CapMed.

  5.3. Staffing. The Ops Ctr staffing is situation dependent. A full Ops Ctr activation consists
  of representatives from the A-Staff, JA, PA, SE and SG operating in the Ops Ctr. The Ops
  Ctr/320 AEW also includes the AFFOR LNOs at the JTF-NCR JOC at Ft McNair (note: the
  JACCE-NCR and medical forces supporting JTF-CapMed are not part of the Ops Ctr/320
  AEW). The AFDW A3 Director (or designated representative) will determine required Ops
  Ctr staffing based on situation intensity and duration. Initial staffing is based on 2 personnel
  per position in order to support 24 hour continuous operations for up to 6 days. If continuous
  24 hour operations are required beyond 6 days, staffing will be increased to 5 personnel per
18                                                       AFDWI10-2 15 NOVEMBER 2012


  Ops Ctr position, with sourcing expected from units external to AFDW. Unless specifically
  restricted, all positions in the Ops Ctr can be filled by equivalent civilian personnel. In
  addition to the representatives tasked in section 3, the following Ops Ctr personnel will also
  be required.
     5.3.1. Ops Ctr Director (OC-DIR). The OC-DIR will be an O-6. The A3/5/9 Director
     and Deputy Director are the default officers to staff this position. Alternate OC-DIRs
     will be selected from within AFDW and certified by the A3 Director. It is highly
     desirable that new OC-DIRs have performed duties as an OC-OPSO.
     5.3.2. Ops Ctr Operations Officer (OC-OPSO). Any field grade officer within AFDW
     may fill this position if certified by the A3 Director. It is highly desirable that new OC-
     OPSOs have performed duties as an OC-Rep.
     5.3.3. JFHQ/JTF-NCR AFFOR LNO. Normally an officer, however a highly qualified
     senior NCO may also fill this position. An operational background is highly desirable
     and this position may be filled from any AFDW directorate. The LNO will be used to
     facilitate the flow of information to and from the JOC. AFDW/A3O will centrally
     manage the certification, qualification, training and scheduling of this LNO requirement.
  5.4. Ops Ctr Tiers of Operations. The Tier levels of the Ops Ctr describe the expected
  hours of operation. The staffing levels for each Tier may be tailored by the OC-DIR to meet
  operational requirements. Initial staffing for Tiers 3 and 2 will be 2 shifts per day for each
  Ops Ctr position.
     5.4.1. Tier 3 Operations (24/7 coverage).
         5.4.1.1. The Ops Ctr will be staffed for 24/7 operations using two 12-hour shifts.

         5.4.2.2. Supports exercises, service support missions or contingencies.
         5.4.2.3. OC-OPSO, OC-Control positions may be staffed 24/7 using 12 hour shifts.
         5.4.2.4. Evening shift OC-Reps will be subject to immediate recall by the OC-DIR
         during off hours if the Tier level needs to be increased to Tier 3.
     5.4.3. Tier 1 Operations (Normal Duty hours).
         5.4.3.1. Operations using standard AFDW duty hours.
         5.4.3.2. Maintains Ops Ctr in a warm status.
         5.4.3.3. Minimum staffing necessary to maintain situational awareness. The OC-DIR
         will determine the staffing requirement but as a minimum one individual to monitor
         operational activity and immediately notify the OC-DIR and OC-OPSO of significant
         events.
  5.5. Shift Changeovers.
AFDWI10-2 15 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                   19


       5.5.1. Incoming OC-Reps will report to the Ops Ctr area to receive a changeover brief 15
       minutes prior to the scheduled shift change. The outgoing OC-Rep will remain on duty
       until released by the OC-DIR/OPSO.
       5.5.2. On duty OC-Reps will conduct a changeover briefing with the incoming OC-Rep
       and ensure they are fully aware of open suspense items and priorities.
       5.5.3. Incoming OC-Reps will read and initial the Ops Ctr Read File.
       5.5.4. OC-OPSO will present an update brief to the Ops Ctr after each shift change.
6. Continuity of Operations (COOP). If a local evacuation is required from the primary Ops
Ctr location, personnel will relocate IAW the AFDW COOP Plan. In addition to relocating to an
alternate site, Ops Ctr personnel may be directed to their normal individual workstations or to
disperse to individual locations and perform their duties with a virtual connectivity via the
various collaboration programs (e.g. DCO Chat, WebEOC, Sharepoint, mIRC). The following is
a general guideline to be followed in the event of a COOP event.
   6.1. Prior to relocation.
       6.1.1. An advance team will be dispatched to the COOP location to validate its ability to
       receive/support Ops Ctr operations.
       6.1.2. In consultation with the OC-DIR, the A4/7 OC-Rep coordinates the sourcing and
       prepositioning of the group’s transportation requirements.
       6.1.3. OC-Reps will prepare/maintain backup log of open suspense items to be worked
       from the alternate location.
       6.1.4. OC-Reps will backup e-mail, databases and information for transport to the COOP
       location.
       6.1.5. OC-Reps will secure classified information and/or prepare it for travel IAW DoD
       classified protective measures.
       6.1.6. OC-Control will update and post recall rosters.

       6.2.2. OC-DIR will re-establish Ops Ctr battle rhythm.
       6.2.3. OC-OPSO will re-establish contact with inter-agency partners.
7. Ops Ctr Training Program. Each Directorate/Personal Staff office will ensure their OC-
Reps are trained and qualified in staff processes and are Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) in their
functional areas. AFDW/A3Y (in coordination with AFDW/A3O) is responsible for the overall
training program on specific Ops Ctr processes and deliverables.

their training program and qualification of their OC-Reps as subject matter experts (SMEs).
Training will focus on ensuring OC-Reps have the required skill sets to represent their
Directorate as SMEs and be able to reach back to work issues/tasks as required. In addition,
each representative will be trained on various collaborative tools during periodic COMMEXs.
   A5.1.1. AFDW/A3O will assist Directorates/Staff agencies that need help developing a
   training program. ADFW/A3Y will assist with the tracking of currencies and training
   documentation.
A5.2. Certification. OC-Rep qualification certification will be accomplished by the specific
Directorates/Staff Agencies (Exception: OC-DIR/OPSOs are certified by AFDW/A3/5/9 and
OC-Control is certified by AFDW/A3O). Documentation of all current and qualified OC-Reps
will be provided by the directorates to AFDW/A3Y.
A5.3. Currency requirements. OC-Reps will accomplish recurrency training IAW the AFDW
Ops Ctr training schedule developed and published by A3. This training is mandatory for all

AFDW/A3O will schedule additional training as required.
