1. General Policy. All personnel must be protected from toxic dispersion, DFO, and
inert/explosive debris (hereafter termed “launch hazards”) during launches from CCAFS and/or
Kennedy Space Center (KSC).
     1.1. Toxic Dispersion Hazard.
        1.1.1. The exhaust plume from solid rocket motors (SRMs) and solid rocket boosters
        (SRBs) contains hazardous materials (primarily hydrogen chloride, an irritant gas). In the
        event of a catastrophic failure of a launch vehicle early in flight, hypergolic propellant
        (i.e., hydrazines, nitrogen tetroxide and their combustion products) may also be present.
        Under certain meteorological conditions, these hazardous substances may drift over Cape
        Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) in concentrations greater than known exposure
        standards permit.
        1.1.2. During day of launch (DOL) mission preparations, on-base personnel within the
        T-0 forecasted Potential Hazard Corridor (PHC) will be provided access to a launch toxic
        shelter, identified by a brown sign, to ensure they are not exposed to hazardous
        concentrations above known exposure limits. Alternatively, they will be relocated to an
        unaffected area.
45SWI91-204 28 AUGUST 2014                                                                       3

   1.2. Distant Focusing Overpressure.
      1.2.1. In the event of a catastrophic launch vehicle failure resulting in a significant
      explosion, if certain meteorological conditions are prevalent, the emanating shock waves
      may be turned back towards the ground resulting in distant focusing overpressure (DFO).
      The focusing of these waves can produce increased overpressures at various locations
      resulting in window breakage and personnel injury.
      1.2.2. On-base personnel in facilities that are within an area of increased DFO risk will
      be instructed to move to an interior portion of the facility or outside the facility, away
      from windows, approximately 5 minutes prior to T-0.
   1.3. Debris Impact Hazard.
      1.3.1. In the event of a catastrophic launch vehicle failure, the resulting debris associated
      with the vehicle will fall to the ground. Primary and secondary effects of inert and
      explosive debris impact may cause personnel injury.
      1.3.2. On-base personnel in facilities or in the open that are within an area of increased
      debris (inert/explosive) risk will be instructed to relocate to an unaffected area.
   1.4. Launch Risk Forecast. 45 SW/SE will provide a mission specific Launch Risk
   Forecast product that details the risks associated with launch hazards.
      1.4.1. Launch risk estimates will be continuously updated in support of the launch
      operation with results posted on the 45 SW Launch Risk Forecast portal,
      https://msd.mantech.com/RiskForecast. To gain access to this site please contact 45
      SW/SELR.
      1.4.2. Generally, T-0 forecasted debris (inert/explosive) risk analysis will be available at
      L-72 hours. T-0 forecasted toxic dispersion risk analysis will be available at L-48 hours.
      Real-time DFO risk analysis will be available based on the DOL balloon release
      schedule. All risk analyses will be updated continually based on available meteorological
      data.

2. Purpose. This instruction establishes procedures to ensure that all CCAFS personnel and
visitors can be protected from launch hazards resulting from any vehicle launched from either
CCAFS or KSC.
3. Structure. This instruction covers required employee education, employee notification
during launches, on-base risk mitigation for employees and visitors, and the responsibilities for
the procedures provided in this instruction.
     3.1. Employee Education. According to Air Force Instruction (AFI) 90-821, Hazard
     Communication, and the Hazard Communications (HAZCOM) Standard (29 Code of Federal
     Regulations (CFR) 1910.1200), all organizations at CCAFS will educate their employees
     concerning hazardous materials they may be exposed to on the job. This includes launch
     hazards awareness training for the entire CCAFS work force. Therefore, as part of the
     employee’s initial in-processing and training, supervisors will ensure personnel are trained on
     the contents of this instruction. Contractors operating on CCAFS will educate employees in
     accordance with their contractual obligations and will be responsible for their own employee
     health and safety programs.
        3.1.1. Once a new employee has received training, the supervisor will document this
        training in the employee’s personnel records. In addition, supervisors will ensure
        employees know where their assigned launch toxic shelters are located for their place of
        duty along with what Aural Warning Zone (AWZ) it is located within, and will update
        the training as changes occur.
     3.2. Employee Notification During Launches. Range Safety, 45 SW/SE, will evaluate the
     potential for launch hazard risk based on current meteorological conditions using 45 SW/SE
     physics models. 45 SW/SE will determine which CCAFS/KSC areas are at an increased risk
     by any or all of these hazards.
        3.2.1. Scheduled Launch Announcement. Cape Support will broadcast Message 1
        (Attachment 2) via the Cape Aural Warning System (CAWS) every 4 hours (i.e., twice
        per shift) starting 2 days prior to the scheduled launch, or later if the launch date is still
        classified at that time. On launch day, Cape Support will broadcast Message 1 at L-242
        minutes and L-182 minutes.            Cape Support will contact the Instrumentation
        Superintendent of Range Operations (ISRO) before each broadcast to avoid conflicting
        with operational announcements. This message alerts the CCAFS population of the
        upcoming launch and potential need for launch toxic shelters.
        3.2.2. Launch Toxic Shelter Identification Announcement. If specific areas of CCAFS
        fall within the forecasted PHC, 45 SW/SE will advise Cape Support to broadcast
        applicable portions of Message 2 (Attachment 3), at L-122 minutes, L-97 minutes, and L-
        72 minutes. Before the first announcement, Cape Support will contact the ISRO for
        clearance to broadcast Message 2 on this schedule. If 45 SW/SE requires announcements
        on a different schedule, Cape Support will contact the ISRO for clearance before each
        broadcast.
     3.3. On-base Risk Mitigation. All employees and visitors on CCAFS within the PHC
     and/or an area of increased risk from DFO or debris (inert/explosive) will be provided
     appropriate risk mitigation options, or will be required to relocate to another location. This
     ensures they are not exposed to hazardous chemical concentrations above known exposure
45SWI91-204 28 AUGUST 2014                                                                        5


   standards or to risk associated with glass breakage or debris (inert/explosive) impact resulting
   from the launch or catastrophic failure of the launch vehicle.
       3.3.1. Risk Mitigation Announcement. If specific areas of CCAFS fall within the
       forecasted PHC or within an area of increased DFO risk, 45 SW/SE will advise Cape
       Support to broadcast applicable portions of Message 3 (Attachment 4), at L-57 minutes,
       L-32 minutes, and L-17 minutes. Before the first announcement, Cape Support will
       contact the ISRO for clearance to broadcast Message 3 on this schedule. If 45 SW/SE
       requires announcements on a different schedule, Cape Support will contact the ISRO for
       clearance before each broadcast.
4. Roles and Responsibilities.
   4.1. Identifying and Certifying Buildings as Launch Shelters for Mitigation of Toxic
   Hazards. Buildings on CCAFS that meet the protection requirements for approved launch
   shelters have been identified. Additional buildings will be tested and designated as launch
   shelters as specified by 45 SW Instruction 91-203, Launch Shelter Certification Process.
       4.1.1. A current listing of approved launch shelters can be provided by contacting 45
       SW/SE. Note: This shelter list is continually under revision and will be updated on a
       regular basis.
   4.2. Launch Shelter Procedures for Mitigation of Toxic Hazards. Facility Managers will
   establish procedures that prepare a certified launch shelter for launches. These procedures
   must address, as required, closing all doors and windows and turning off ventilation systems
   that draw air from the outside. Specific guidance on developing launch shelter procedures
   can be found in 45 SWI 91-203, Launch Shelter Certification Process.
       4.2.1. During duty hours, all Facility Managers for buildings designed as launch shelters
       will be considered as launch essential and must ensure that their building is available for
       shelter.
       4.2.2. During non-duty hours, shelters that would normally be unoccupied during the
       launch period need not be opened merely for shelter purposes and the Facility Manager or
       representative is not considered launch essential.
       4.2.3. During launch operations when a shelter is opened (unlocked), a responsible
       person must be designated to ensure that all shelter procedures are effectively
       implemented for that facility.
       4.2.4. All organizations must ensure that their employees know where appropriate launch
       shelters are located for their place of duty and have a clear understanding of the AWZs
       (Attachment 9). Supervisors must ensure employees know where their primary and
       alternate shelters are located for both normal duty hours and other than normal duty
       hours, or if the primary or alternate shelter is not available for the planned launch period.
       4.2.5. Shelter activation will be based on T-0 forecasted and real-time meteorological
       data along with 45 SW/SE physics models. 45 SW/SE, in coordination with
       Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE), will continue to evaluate conditions and confirm
       which CCAFS areas are within the PHC.
6                                                             45SWI91-204 28 AUGUST 2014


    4.3. Real-Time Notification.
       4.3.1. After 45 SW/SE has determined affected areas, they will advise Cape Support to
       broadcast applicable portions of Message 3 (Attachment 4), via CAWS, at L-57 minutes,
       L-32 minutes, and L-17 minutes. Before the first announcement, Cape Support will
       contact the ISRO for clearance to broadcast Message 3 on this schedule; if 45 SW/SE
       requires announcements on other than the above schedule, Cape Support will contact the
       ISRO for clearance before each broadcast.
       4.3.2. Upon receipt of Message 3, each Facility Manager in designated/approved launch
       shelters in affected areas will secure their building in accordance with established
       procedures. Organizational Commanders and/or managers, or their representative, in
       each facility will ensure that their employees are following the announcements as they
       are being conveyed via CAWS.
       4.3.3. Personnel on CCAFS will proceed to their assigned shelters, or identified
       evacuation point, as dictated by the broadcast message. It is not necessary at this time to
       enter and remain in the shelter. Employees may observe the launch from areas
       immediately outside their shelter, as long as they can enter and secure the shelter without
       delay when necessary.
       4.3.4. In the event of a catastrophic launch vehicle failure prior to time off the beach,
       Cape Support, upon direction from 45 SW/SE, will broadcast Message 4 (Attachment 5)
       as a precautionary measure, via CAWS, and will repeat it 10 and 20 minutes after the
       accident. All affected personnel, as designated by Message 4, will respond as directed.
       Each Facility Manager will ensure their shelter is secure with all doors and windows
       closed. Ventilation systems will be secured in accordance with the pre-approved facility
       launch shelter procedure checklist. Cape Support will contact the ISRO for clearance to
       broadcast Message 4 on this schedule.
       4.3.5. In the event of a catastrophic launch vehicle failure prior to time off the beach
       when the exhaust plume affects specific areas of CCAFS, 45 SW/SE will advise Cape
       Support to broadcast Message 5 (Attachment 6), via CAWS, and will repeat as directed
       by 45 SW/SE. Before broadcasting, Cape Support will contact the ISRO to avoid
       conflicting with the Audible Plus Count system or other required operational messages.
       All personnel in the affected areas will enter their shelter at once. The Facility Manager
       will ensure the shelter is secured in accordance with the pre-approved facility launch
       shelter procedure checklist.
       4.3.6. When 45 SW/SE, in coordination with Bioenvironmental Engineering and the
       Emergency Operations Center (EOC) Director, determines hazardous conditions no
       longer exist, 45 SW/SE will direct Cape Support to broadcast one of the applicable all-
       clear messages via CAWS, Message 6 (Attachment 7) or Message 7 (Attachment 8). At
       this time, normal activities may resume, ventilation systems may be restored, and normal
       access procedures reestablished. Note: To determine if a facility is inside an identified
       affected area prior to launch day, contact 45 SW/SELR at 494-3287.
       4.3.7. In the event of a normal launch when pre-launch mitigating actions were required,
       to include the use of Message 2 (Attachment 3) and/or Message 3 (Attachment 4),
       Message 7 (Attachment 8) should be made no earlier than T+5 minutes to avoid conflict
45SWI91-204 28 AUGUST 2014                                                                     7


     with the Audible Plus Count system. Cape Support will contact the ISRO before
     broadcasting to avoid conflicting with required operational messages.
  4.4. Launch Security Procedures. Launch Security will be posted according to the mission
  specific Operational Plan and Roadblock Access letter.
     4.4.1. Launch Security vehicles that are equipped with public address systems and are on
     patrol within activated AWZs will be used to inform all personnel of their AWZ and the
     need to seek shelter. Launch Security personnel should comply with all CAWS
     announcements.
     4.4.2. Launch Security Officers who observe individuals or groups gathering in non-
     approved areas (i.e., non-approved visitor locations as conveyed in the Launch Readiness
     Review, Mobile Service Towers, rooftops, antenna platforms, non-approved launch
     sheltering areas during sheltering conditions) to watch a launch will direct the individuals
     to disperse and proceed to their approved shelter, if required.
         4.4.2.1. Launch Security Officers will inform the EOC Director of compliance with
         toxic sheltering announcements when announcements are required. As a member of
         the EOC Team, the Pad Safety Manager will convey field status to the Risk
         Assessment Center (RAC). This information will act as confirmation to the RAC that
         recommended mitigating actions are being taken.
     4.4.3. Pre-coordinated Traffic Control Points (TCPs), as outlined in the Roadblock
     Access letter, may not be moved without 45 SW/SE approval in order to ensure personnel
     are not needlessly placed at risk.
     4.4.4. If required, additional TCPs will be established to control access to areas within
     the PHC, using on-duty security patrols.
  4.5. Official Visitor Procedures. Certain categories of individuals who do not directly
  support launch operations (i.e., distinguished guests, media, contractors, program
  representatives, and launch team family members), may be permitted on CCAFS to view
  launches. These persons will be included in all risk analyses and will be assessed against
  current launch commit criteria as given in AFI 91-217, Space Safety and Mishap Prevention
  Program, or 14 CFR 417, Aeronautics and Space, Launch Safety, as applicable.
     4.5.1. Organizations that sponsor visitors for launch viewing must ensure that ALL
     visitors are aware of the following and adhere to section 4.5.1.6:
         4.5.1.1. The AWZs provided at Attachment 9.
         4.5.1.2. The messages contained in the attachments of this instruction.
         4.5.1.3. The need to follow instructions conveyed in each CAWS message.
         4.5.1.4. The location of the designated launch shelter or evacuation point, when
         applicable.
         4.5.1.5. If sheltering is required in their AWZ and adequate sheltering is not
         available, visitors must proceed to an approved alternate viewing location.
         4.5.1.6. Organizations sponsoring visitors, including distinguished guests and the
         media, must assign a point of contact (POC) for their visitors. It is the responsibility
8                                                              45SWI91-204 28 AUGUST 2014


           of the visitor POC to call the Risk Assessment Center (RAC) at 853-8440 two hours
           prior to launch, or before departing for their designated viewing location, to verify
           that no sheltering issues exist and that they can populate their viewing location.
    4.6. Launch Essential/Neighboring Operations Personnel Inside Affected Areas. Based
    on risk modeling output associated with launch hazards, the 45 SW/CC or designated
    representative will direct personnel to either evacuate the affected area, seek shelter in an
    approved launch shelter, or will halt the launch. Launch essential and/or neighboring
    operations personnel whose duties necessitate that they remain in place, either in the open or
    not in an approved launch toxic shelter, therefore not able to pre-clear from a PHC, must:
       4.6.1. Have a 45 SW/SE approved post-accident emergency egress capability with egress
       routes based on real-time toxic modeling.
       4.6.2. Be physically qualified, trained/certified, and equipped for use of a Self-Contained
       Breathing Apparatus (SCBA), the 45 SW Bioenvironmental Engineer (BE) approved
       personal protective equipment (PPE).
    4.7. Bioenvironmental Engineer (BE) Support.
       4.7.1. DOL BE (45 AMDS/SGPB) support is required for all vehicles launching from
       KSC or CCAFS that could pose a toxic dispersion risk, as determined by 45 SW/SELR.
       A BE representative in the RAC acts as the POC for the field team. The Field Support
       Team is deployed into the PHC and will take readings/samples in the case of a
       catastrophic failure of the launch vehicle.
           4.7.1.1. The BE representative will review all 45 SW/SELR postings on the Launch
           Risk Forecast Portal and arrive at the RAC at least two hours prior to launch.
           4.7.1.2. The BE Field Support Team will be in place, downwind of the PHC, at least
           one hour prior to launch.
           4.7.1.3. All BE Field Support Team members will be physically qualified,
           trained/certified, and equipped to use SCBA.
           4.7.1.4. In the case of a catastrophic launch vehicle failure prior to time off the
           beach, the field team will record real-time readings and may relay this information
           through their POC to the toxic dispersion risk analyst in the RAC. Additionally, BE
           will provide readings, to include corresponding concentrations (ppm) and toxic plume
           timing (min), to 45 SW/SE within 48 hours of the launch accident.
