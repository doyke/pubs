1.2. Phases of Training:
     1.2.1. Initial Qualification Training (IQT). This training is necessary to qualify aircrew
     for duties in the aircraft. See Chapter 2 for IQT program requirements.
     1.2.2. Mission Qualification Training (MQT). This training is necessary to qualify
     aircrew for the unit’s mission or local area requirements. This training may be incorporated
     in MAJCOM-approved IQT syllabi. See Chapter 3 for MQT program requirements.
     1.2.3. Continuation Training (CT). This training is necessary for qualified aircrew to
     maintain their assigned level of proficiency, increase flight qualifications, and develop as
     instructors. It provides minimum ground and flight training requirements for proficiency. See
     Chapter 4 for CT program requirements. Squadron commanders certify pilots as
     experienced or inexperienced using the definitions in Attachment 1.
     1.2.4. Specialized Training. This training is necessary to carry out the unit’s assigned
     missions but is not required of every crewmember. Individuals recognized by the unit will
     accomplish appropriate formal course training to qualify personnel in these specialized areas
     or to comply with locally-developed syllabi and squadron-developed training progression.
     See Chapter 5 for specialized training program requirements.
1.3. Training Concepts and Policies:
     1.3.1. Commanders will ensure training programs are designed to achieve the highest degree
     of qualification consistent with flight safety, resource availability, and mission requirements.
     1.3.2. Units will normally train every assigned or attached pilot to MR status. The OG
     commander may approve training for individual pilots to basic aircraft qualified (BAQ) if
     there is minimal impact to the mission, and adequate resources are available to support
     required nonmission sortie and event requirements. Document this authorization in the
     individual’s training folder. Exception: US Air Force Academy (USAFA) cadets will only
     be BAQ in the T-41 and T-51, and OG commander approval is not required.

   manpower documents (UMD) and pilot status is properly designated. The overall objective is
   for pilots to perform only operations-related duties. Supervisors may assign pilots to valid,
   short-term tasks (escort officer, flying evaluation board member, mishap board member,
   etc.), but must continually weigh the factors involved, such as level of pilot tasking, flying
   proficiency, currency, and experience.
   1.5.2. Duties required by various publications that may be assigned to aircrew position
   indicator (API)-1 pilots are quality assurance evaluator, programmer, flying safety officer,
   SOF, mobility contingency plans officer, training (except ARMS duties), flight equipment
   officer, and other duties directly related to flying operations. API-1s will not be attached to
   wing staffs or hold wing staff positions unless total wing pilot API-1 and API-6 manning is
   100 percent or better. Commanders will ensure wing staff pilots (API-6s) perform duties
   justified in MAJCOM manpower standards documents and authorized in the UMD.

                      INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING (IQT)

2.1. General:
   2.1.1. This chapter outlines the initial qualification training program. On completion of the
   program, pilots will be qualified in accordance with (IAW) AFI 11-202, Volume 2, and AFI
   11-2T-41-51-52, Volume 2, T-41 and T-51 Aircrew Evaluation Criteria, as first pilots (FP).
   NOTE: Only one combined evaluation is required when pilots complete MQT in conjunction
   with IQT.
   2.1.2. Except in unusual circumstances, aircrew members undergoing qualification training
   will receive ground and flight instruction with a minimum of interruption, and complete
   training within the time specified by the syllabus. Failure to complete training within the
   specified time limit requires notifying the gaining group commander of the individual’s name
   and grade, reason for delay, planned actions, and estimated completion date.
   2.1.3. Completion of IQT qualifies the pilot to act as pilot in command (PIC) of the aircraft
   under day visual flight rules (VFR).
2.2. Prerequisites. Before entering qualification training, each aircrew member must comply
with the appropriate formal course training prerequisites prescribed in education and training
course announcements (ETCA) available at https:\\etca.randolph.af.mil. In addition, all
personnel maintaining flying status will meet the physical examination and training requirements
in AFI 11-202, Volume 1, before flying.
   2.2.1. USAFA cadets entering training for T-41 or T-51 qualification must hold at least a
   Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) private pilot certificate with an airplane single-
   engine land rating and at least an FAA third-class medical certificate.
   2.2.2. Civilian coaches must meet the requirements of AFI 11-401, Aviation Management,
   and hold at least an FAA third-class medical certificate and a flight instructor certificate with
   airplane and single-engine ratings. (EXCEPTION: Former military pilots need not hold a
   flight instructor certificate if they maintain an instructor pilot qualification in accordance
   with (IAW) AFI 11-2T-41-51-52, Volume 2.)
2.3. Ground Training. Ground training will follow the formal course syllabus flow. For in-unit
qualification training, commanders will obtain and use current formal school courseware, if
available.
2.4. Flying Training. Pilots in IQT will fly under IP supervision until completing the
qualification evaluation. Formal course syllabus mission objectives and tasks are minimum
requirements for IQT. Additional training due to student nonprogression is only available within
the constraints of the formal course syllabus. Pilots may satisfy MQT and specialized training
requirements during IQT if the appropriate IP is available and the formal course training allows.
2.5. Senior Officer Qualification. Comply with the guidance provided in AFI 11-401 and AFI
11-202, Volume 1.
2.6. Flight Surgeon Qualification. IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 1, FS training will consist of
ground and flying training as follows:
AFI11-2T-41-51-52-53V1 12 MARCH 2010                                                              11


   2.6.1. Ground training will include:
       2.6.1.1. Aircraft general review.
       2.6.1.2. An emergency procedures review with an IP.
       2.6.1.3. Cockpit/crew resource management (CRM) training according to AFI 11-290,

       2.6.1.6. The completion of an FS qualification examination according to AFI 11-202,
       Volume 2.
   2.6.2. For flying training, upon completion of ground training, an FS is qualified to occupy
   any seat when an IP is at the controls. An FS will not operate the controls unless an IP is at
   the controls and will not fly during critical phases of flight.
2.7. Requalification Training. An aircrew member is unqualified upon expiration of his or her
qualification evaluation or loss of currency exceeding 6 months (paragraph 4.7). Follow the
requalification guidance in AFI 11-202, Volume 1, and paragraph 4.8 of this instruction.
2.8. Conversion and Difference Qualifications. Conversion qualification follows the guidance
in this chapter and the formal course qualification syllabus. Difference training is authorized for
qualification when the pilot is qualified in any single-engine, propeller-driven aircraft and will be
qualified in another. The formal course syllabus identifies the minimum difference training. No
other difference training is authorized.
2.9. Multiple Qualifications. Qualification in more than one mission design series (MDS) is
authorized IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 1. (NOTE: Multiple qualifications are not authorized for
general officers.) Multiple qualifications require completion of IQT or difference training as
specified in this chapter. NOTE: Difference qualification is authorized in paragraph 2.8.

                      MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING (MQT)

3.1. General. MQT upgrades pilots who have completed IQT to MR status as an IP. For rated
pilots and civilian coaches, MQT is normally conducted in conjunction with IQT (paragraph
2.1.1). At the completion of MQT, the squadron commander certifies the pilot as an MR IP.
3.2. Prerequisites:
   3.2.1. Completion of IQT, unless conducted in conjunction with MQT.
   3.2.2. Additional unit-specified prerequisites for MQT.
3.3. Ground Training. Units will maintain lesson plans for MQT ground training. When MQT
is not conducted in conjunction with IQT, minimum ground training will consist of the IP ground
training required by the formal course syllabus.
3.4. Flying Training. When MQT is not conducted in conjunction with IQT, complete the
instructional sorties required by the formal course instructor syllabus. Accomplish at least three
sorties in the right seat under the supervision of an upgrade IP.
3.5. Training Completion. Pilots must complete MQT within the training time prescribed in
the formal course syllabus. The OG commander is waiver authority for training time extensions.
Units will document this waiver in the individual’s training folder. Units may consider MQT
complete after successful completion of a mission evaluation.
3.6. Documentation. Document MQT in the individual’s training folder.
3.7. Sorties. When MQT is not conducted in conjunction with IQT, units will log MQT sorties
as missions support sorties. MQT sorties and events may be used to meet the sortie and event
requirements for the upgrade pilot during the training cycle in which they are flown.

                                            Chapter 4

                             CONTINUATION TRAINING (CT)

4.1. General. This chapter outlines the minimum training and currency for qualified aircrew
and provides for development of individual IPs through additional certifications and instructor
development (ID) sorties.
   4.1.1. ID sorties provide an opportunity for instructors to enhance their mission effectiveness
   and improve student performance. While these sorties provide for flying skills improvement,
   update currency, and allow for accomplishment of events required by this chapter, the
   purposes of ID sorties are to develop the unit’s instructors and standardize training. An ID
   sortie allows experienced instructors to pass on successful techniques and methods to less
   experienced instructors beyond formal training. The buddy IP (BIP) program’s sponsor
   sorties and ID sorties allow inexperienced IPs to learn and refine techniques while flying
   with more experienced IPs.
   4.1.2. Units may direct additional training in a supplement to this instruction.
   4.1.3. Units will track all ground and flying training requirements in ARMS. (Refer to
   ETCA for ancillary training.)
4.2. Training Cycle. There is one annual training cycle: 1 June to 31 May of each calendar
year.
4.3. Quarterly Meetings:
   4.3.1. CT Meetings. Commanders will direct and supervise quarterly CT meetings. The
   purpose of these meetings is to discuss standardization and mission-related topics, and to
   increase general knowledge among all pilots. A CRM topic or scenario will be discussed in
   each CT meeting referring to CRM core concepts from AFI 11-290.
   4.3.2. IP Meetings. Commanders will direct and supervise quarterly IP meetings.
   Commanders will use these meetings to discuss standardization, instructional techniques,
   grading practices, and recent trends. They may be combined with CT meetings if all topics
   are adequately covered.
   4.3.3. Attendance. Attendance at CT and IP meetings is mandatory. The unit will determine
   a method to track attendance at CT and IP meetings as part of the go/no-go process for flight.
   Individuals who are not available for CT or IP meetings will read the meeting minutes or be
   briefed by an operations supervisor before their next flight.
4.4. Ground Training Requirements. Table 4.1 summarizes ground training requirements.
For ground training prescribed by other instructions, units must refer to those instructions for the
latest requirement. Initial ground training accomplished during IQT and MQT may be credited
toward CT requirements for the training cycle in which it was accomplished.

 sized groups are allowed so all members can participate to the fullest extent and share equal
 time responding to emergency situations. Teaching SEPT may satisfy semiannual SEPT
 requirement for the IP who administers the training. SEPT may also be accomplished in a
 static aircraft, or in a cockpit trainer.
4.5. Flying Training Requirements. Pilots will accomplish the applicable annual requirements
in Table 4.2. The OG/CC (or the NAF director of operations [DO] for a NAF flight examiner
[FE]) is the waiver authority for individual aircrew requirements. Document this waiver,
including justification, in the individual’s training folder. Refer to Attachment 4 for guidance on
logging sorties and events.

 Notes:
 *1. Not applicable to the ANG.
 2. Although not the intended purpose, pilots may update currencies and log events on ID
 sorties.
 *3. Credit towards total landings.
 *4. Only required for T-41 and T-51 pilots.
4.6. Failure to Complete Annual Requirements. Pilots who fail to complete annual training
requirements according to Table 4.2 will not fly in the new training cycle until a review is
completed to determine the cause of the deficiency and if the pilot requires any additional
training in the new training cycle. If an IP fails to complete an ID sortie, then additional training
must include the delinquent ID sortie prior to performing instructor duties.
   4.6.1. The OG commander (or the NAF DO for a NAF FE) is the reviewer and waiver
   authority. The reviewer should consider the type and magnitude of the deficiency and the
   pilot’s experience level to determine if additional training, increased supervision, or a waiver
   to the previous training cycle requirements is warranted. Document this waiver, with
   justification, in the individual’s training folder.
   4.6.2. Refer to paragraph 4.13 for guidance on prorating requirements. Refer to AFI 11-
   402, Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, for guidance on
   aviation service suspension when failure to complete requirements is within the member’s
   control.
4.7. Flying Training Currencies. Table 4.3 defines currency requirements for all qualified
pilots. Any pilot not meeting currency requirements will not perform the sortie or event except
under the supervision of an IP. (Exception: Pilots who are noncurrent for a NIFA event may
regain that currency with any certified NIFA instructor.) Refer to Attachment 4 for guidance on
logging sorties and events for currency and recurrency.

4.13. Prorating Requirements. Squadron commanders:
   4.13.1. May prorate training requirements according to AFI 11-202, Volume 1, at the end of
   the training cycle.
   4.13.2. Will not consider annual leave as nonavailability but may consider periods of cadet
   nonenrollment and extended periods of adverse weather or periods when the aircraft are not
   available for normal use, which preclude the unit from flying more than 15 days in a month,
   as nonavailability.
   4.13.3. Will prorate requirements only to adjust for genuine circumstances of training
   nonavailability, not to mask training or planning deficiencies.
   4.13.4. Will consider newly assigned or qualified pilots who achieve qualification after the
   15th of the month to be in CT on the first day of the following month.
