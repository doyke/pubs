                                            Chapter 1

                                          OVERVIEW

1.1. All Airmen are subject to threats whether in the continental United States (CONUS),
outside the continental United States (OCONUS) or deployed to expeditionary
bases. Asymmetric threats and hazards, including those from insiders (as addressed in AFDD 3-
10), will increasingly challenge US personnel, facilities and assets. Note: The USAF definition
of FP includes all hazards, but this expanded definition does not expand the Intel support mission
to include all hazards. Understanding how these threats and hazards affect the mission is the first
step toward developing an effective FP program that will help commanders assess their ability to
deter, pre-empt, negate or mitigate hostile actions or events.
1.2. Antiterrorism is one element of FP, which is a collection of actions taken to prevent or
mitigate hostile acts against Department of Defense (DoD) personnel, resources, facilities
and critical information. A commander’s FP program should be designed to integrate all
available information for its best possible application. Intelligence operations can assist
commanders in this effort by providing threat information to drive the planning and execution of
FP activities. Accomplishing this requires a change to our AF culture, thus affecting the ways
commanders use and deploy intelligence personnel, products and services, and challenging our
intelligence analysis paradigm to include support to ground-based operations. Intelligence
personnel must be organized, trained and equipped to support the FP mission and FP customers.
They must also be poised to help protect personnel, resources, critical assets and information
from threats that could destroy, damage or compromise the capability of the AF to perform its
assigned missions.
1.3. Force Protection Intelligence (FPI) is analyzed, all-source intelligence information
that, when integrated or fused with other FP information, provides an assessment of the
threats to DoD missions, people or resources. FPI is proactive and drives FP decisions in
support of the commander’s intent.
1.4. Fused FP information and assessments provide the best-available picture of the intent
and capability of terrorists or extremists, criminal entities and enterprises, Foreign
Intelligence and Security Services (FISS), opposing military forces and, in certain
instances, environmental/medical hazards, infrastructure vulnerabilities, and insider
threats. Intelligence personnel must be organized to provide credible support and trained to
understand and anticipate FP requirements. They must also be equipped with the right tools to
support FP customers at all echelons.
1.5. Adhering to guidance in Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 2000. 16,
Antiterrorism (AT) Standards. FP assessments are performed collaboratively by intelligence,
Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), and security forces (SF) personnel and in
cooperation with several other entities. These entities include operations, weather, medical,
communications, etc. FP customers include all personnel from commanders to airmen, but more
tailored, specialized support can be provided to: commanders, aircrews, SF, explosive ordnance
disposal (EOD), civil engineers, medical personnel, antiterrorism officers (ATO), Phoenix
Ravens/flyaway security teams, AFOSI, threat working groups (TWG), antiterrorism working
groups (ATWG), integrated defense working groups (IDWG), base defense operations center
 4                                                                        AFI14-119 4 MAY 2012


(BDOC), CRG, or other associated units. FP information assessments should include all relevant
information.
1.6. Intelligence supports FP directly through unit deployments, readiness training,
mission planning support, and threat analysis. Intelligence also supports the Integrated
Defense (ID), Critical Asset Risk Management (CARM), and indirectly, the Emergency
Management elements of the FP mission. Outside the CONUS, intelligence collection activities
target foreign adversaries. Within the CONUS, however, AFOSI works with federal, state, tribal
and local law enforcement and intelligence agencies to identify, exploit and neutralize criminal,
terrorist and foreign intelligence threats to the USAF, DoD, and US Government (USG).
Generally, intelligence personnel provide the following support to FP operations:
     1.6.1. Indications and warning (emerging crisis situations).
     1.6.2. Current intelligence (adversary intentions, courses of action).
     1.6.3. General military intelligence (adversary Order of Battle [OB], cultural awareness
     information).
     1.6.4. Near-real-time/real-time situational awareness and understanding.
     1.6.5. Intelligence preparation of the operating environment (IPOE) (adversary capabilities
     and tactics, techniques and procedures [TTPs], terrorist group historical background and
     intent, SIPRNET and SCI message traffic, finished intelligence, terrain analysis, route
     analysis, man-portable air defense system [MANPADS]/stand-off weapons footprints, cyber
     threat, etc.). Note: This can be performed at all CONUS and OCONUS locations. Refer to
     AFI 14-104, paragraphs 10 and 12.
     1.6.6. Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT), target intelligence (maps, charts, imagery, target
     studies, and target folder development and, if appropriate, Measurement and Signature
     Intelligence (MASINT).
     1.6.7. Combat assessment (pre-/post-mission briefings/debriefings, mission assessments).
     1.6.8. Scientific and technical intelligence         (weapon     characteristics,   capabilities,
     vulnerabilities, limitations and effectiveness).
     1.6.9. FPI-related commander’s critical information requirements (CCIR), develop priority
     intelligence requirements (PIR) and essential elements of information (EEI). Note:
     Although collection management is usually limited to OCONUS locations, CCIRs and PIRs
     may be generated within the CONUS, but IAW AFI 10-245, Antiterrorism (AT), CONUS
     PIRs are the responsibility of AFOSI.
        1.6.9.1. This AFI should not be interpreted as authorization for intelligence personnel to
        collect and maintain information on US persons without an authorized mission to do so.
        Refer to AFI 14-104 for complete guidance regarding collection, processing, exploitation,
        dissemination and retention of information with respect to US persons.
        1.6.9.2. While Intelligence Oversight (IO) policy restricts collection of information on
        US persons to units with an authorized mission, it should not be interpreted as excluding
        FPI-responsible intelligence personnel from receiving, viewing, fusing, analyzing or
        passing such information to the proper entity (SF or AFOSI) responsible for mitigating

     the threat. In most matters regarding US persons’ information, intelligence personnel
     will defer to AFOSI in its role as a designated counterintelligence (CI) component.

2.7. Tenant Unit Intelligence Responsibilities.
   2.7.1. The host unit with BOS responsibilities, whether AF or Joint, provides for the force
   protection of the installation and personnel.
   2.7.2. Tenant units must ensure they are included on their host installation’s FP plan through
   Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) and that they are on distribution/notification schedule
   for threat information. The MOA should define the relationship and the tenant FP
   requirements, especially if the tenant performs a mission or possesses a system that could be
   at risk to FP threats. (T-2)
   2.7.3. In the event that the host unit does not have an organic intelligence capability and the
   tenant unit does, tenant intelligence must be prepared to provide FPI support to the host unit;
   the relationship and requirements defined through MOA.
      2.7.4. Tenant units are responsible for providing FPI support to their tenant unit leadership
      and personnel. Tenant units will:
         2.7.4.1. Coordinate with the installation ATO to ensure processes/procedures are in place
         and documented in the installation ID/AT plan to receive, process, or correlate threat
         warnings/information. (T-3)
         2.7.4.2. Brief tenant staff, aircrews and other appropriate parties on the installation LTA,
         as required. (T-3)

     2.7.4.3. In coordination with local AFOSI Regional offices provide tenant staff, aircrews
     and other FP customers pre-deployment terrorist and FIE threat information. If needed,
     the AFOSI Regional offices can seek assistance from the AFOSI ICON. (T-2)
     2.7.4.4. Support tenant unit SAVs, ORIs, Vas, UCIs, NSIs, exercises, etc., as required.
     2.7.4.5. Document tenant unit activities (e.g., continuity book). (T-2)
  2.7.5. While not all the requirements defined in this AFI apply to all tenant units, it should
  be understood that the role of intelligence in force protection is critical and every effort
  should be made to guarantee that no gaps exist in support to force protection and the mission.

Terms
Administrative Control—Direction or exercise of authority over subordinate or other
organizations in respect to administration and support, including organization of Service forces,
control of resources and equipment, personnel management, unit logistics, individual and unit
training, readiness, mobilization, demobilization, discipline, and other matters not included in the
operational missions of the subordinate or other organizations. Also called ADCON. (JP 0-2)
Antiterrorism—Defensive measures used to reduce the vulnerability of individuals and property
to terrorist acts, to include rapid containment by local military and civilian forces. (JP 1-02)
Antiterrorism Officer (ATO)—The installation, base, regional, facility, or deploying AT
advisor charged with managing the AT Program. He/she shall be a graduate of an approved
Level II Course and be identified in writing by the installation and/or force commander.
Reference AFI 10-245.
Antiterrorism Working Group (ATWG)—The commander’s cross-functional working group
made up of wing and tenant units. Working group members are responsible for coordinating and
providing deliberate planning for all antiterrorism and force protection issues. The ATWG
includes representatives from areas across the installation, including civil engineering,
intelligence, AFOSI, security forces, public health, bioenvironmental, disaster preparedness,
plans, communications, etc.
Base Boundary—A line that delineates the surface area of a base for the purpose of facilitating
coordination and deconfliction of operation between adjacent units, formation, or areas. (JP 1-
02)
Base Defense Operations Center (BDOC)—A command and control facility established by the
base commander to serve as the focal point for base security and defense. It plans, directs,
integrates, coordinates, and controls all base defense efforts and coordinates and integrates into
area security operations with the rear area operations center/rear tactical operations center.
Reference AFI 31-101.
Base Security Zone—The battle space from which the enemy can launch an attack against base
personnel and resources or aircraft approaching/departing the base. (AFTTP 3-10.2)
Battle Space—The commander’s conceptual view of the area and factors which he/she must
understand to successfully apply combat power, protect the force, and complete the mission. It
encompasses all applicable aspects of air, sea, space, and land operations that the commander
must consider in planning and executing military operations. The battle space dimensions can
change over time as the mission expands or contracts according to operational objectives and
force composition. Battle space provides the commander a mental forum for analyzing and
selecting courses of action for employing military forces in relationship to time, tempo, and
depth.
AFI14-119 4 MAY 2012                                                                                 25


Commander’s Critical Information Requirement (CCIR)—An information requirement
identified by the commander as being critical to facilitating timely decision-making. The two
key elements are friendly force information requirements and priority intelligence requirements.
Contingency Response Group (CRG)—An AF capability with effects that span the joint force,
the CRG serves as the first of five force modules to assess and open air bases to extend the reach
of air and space forces. They provide combatant commanders with initial Airbase Opening and
air mobility support capability during wartime, contingency, or other USTRANSCOM/AMC
directed missions. CRG extend air mobility operations worldwide by deploying task organized
mobility teams capable of airbase assessment, initial C2, cargo and passenger handling, in-transit
visibility, quick-turn aircraft maintenance, self-protection security, air traffic control, and airfield
operations.
Counterintelligence (CI)—Information gathered and activities conducted to protect against
espionage, other intelligence activities, sabotage, or assassinations conducted by or on behalf of
foreign governments or elements thereof, foreign organizations, or foreign persons, or
international terrorist activities. In this AFI, CI specifically refers to information about threats to
AF installations gathered through activities conducted by the AFOSI or other service and
national CI organizations. CI analyzes the threats posed by foreign intelligence and security
services and the intelligence activities of non-state actors such as organized crime, terrorist
groups, drug traffickers, and the insider threat. CI analysis incorporates all-source information
and the results of CI investigations and operations to support a multidiscipline analysis of the
force protection threat.
Critical Asset Risk Management (CARM) Program—Formerly known as the Critical
Infrastructure program, CARM is a mission assurance, risk-management-based program that
assures the AF’s ability to execute missions and capabilities essential to planning, mobilizing,
deploying, executing and sustaining military operations that encompass Combatant Command
operational and AF Title 10 United States Code (U.S.C.) missions and capabilities.
Defense Force Commander (DFC)—The DFC directs the planning and execution of base
defense operations and serves as the Installation Commander‘s primary advisor for ID. On AF
installations, the SF squadron commander is the DFC. On installations with more than one SF
squadron, the DFC is the SF commander responsible for installation security. In addition to SF
permanently assigned to the DFC, the DFC exercises TACON of the ID mission and supporting
forces. The tactical role of the DFC does not grant him/her administrative control (ADCON)
authority of supporting ID forces; however, the DFC‘s tactical role serves to ensure unity of
effort, cohesive communication, deconfliction of issues, and to lessen the likelihood of fratricide.
Defense Threat Assessment (DTA)—An all-source assessment of threats to an installation.
AFOSI is responsible for the DTA. Reference DoD message, Standardized DoD Threat
Assessment, 22 Dec 03; AFOSI Manual 71-144 Volume 7, CI Collections, Analysis and
Production.
Essential Elements of Information—The most critical information requirements regarding the
adversary and the environment needed by the commander by a particular time to relate with
other available information and intelligence in order to assist in reaching a logical decision.
Flyaway Security Team (FAST)—See Phoenix Ravens
 26                                                                      AFI14-119 4 MAY 2012


Force Protection (FP)—Actions taken to prevent or mitigate hostile actions against Department
of Defense personnel (to include Active Duty, AFRC, ANG, DoD civilians, contractors, and
family members), resources, facilities, and critical information. These actions conserve the
force’s fighting potential so it can be applied at the decisive time and place and incorporate the
coordinated and synchronized offensive and defensive measures to enable the effective
employment of the joint force while degrading opportunities for the enemy. Force protection
does not include actions to defeat the enemy or protect against accidents, weather, or disease.
(JP 1-02) Note: The AF definition in AFDD 3-10 deviates as: The process of detecting threats
and hazards to the AF and its mission, and applying measures to deter, pre-empt, negate or
mitigate them based on an acceptable risk; this modified definition does not expand the Intel
support mission to include all hazards (e.g., EM, bio-medical, infrastructure, weather), it is only
provided for understanding and clarity.
Force Protection Information—Fused information from FP sources (CI, SF, Intel, etc.) that
provides the best available picture of the intents and capabilities of terrorists or extremists,
criminal entities and enterprises, FISS, opposing military forces, and in certain instances,
environmental/medical hazards, infrastructure vulnerabilities, and insider threats.
Force Protection Intelligence (FPI)—Analyzed, all-source intelligence information that when
integrated, or fused with other FP information provides an assessment of the threats to DoD
missions, people or resources. FPI is proactive and drives FP decisions in support of
commander’s intent.
Force Protection Program—Commander’s program designed to protect Service members,
civilian employees, family members, facilities, information and equipment, in all locations and
situations, accomplished through planned and integrated application of combating terrorism,
physical security, operations security, personal protective services and supported by intelligence,
counterintelligence and other security programs.
Foreign Disclosure—Oral or visual transmission of information through approved channels to
authorized representative of a foreign government.
Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT)—The exploitation and analysis of imagery and geospatial
information to describe, assess and visually depict physical features and geographically
referenced activities on the Earth. Geospatial intelligence consists of imagery, imagery
intelligence and geospatial information. (JP 2-03)
Information—Facts, data, or instructions in any medium or form.
Integrated Defense—The application of active and passive defense measures, employed across
the legally-defined ground dimension of the operational environment, to mitigate potential risks
and defeat adversary threats to AF operations. As an AF-wide responsibility, effective ID helps
ensure effective FP. Security of resources and personnel, in garrison or deployed, is an inherent
command responsibility and requires active participation of all Airman, regardless of AF
specialty, rank or position for mission success.
Intelligence—The product resulting from the collection, processing, integration, evaluation,
analysis, and interpretation of available information concerning foreign nations, hostile or
potentially hostile forces or elements, or areas of actual or potential operations. The term is also
applied to the activity which results in the product and to the organizations engaged in such
activity. (JP 1-02)
AFI14-119 4 MAY 2012                                                                           27


Intelligence Fusion Cell (IFC)—The IFC is a proactive action group, either collocated or
virtually connected, whereby the Security Forces Staff coordinates with subject matter experts
(SMEs) from the Intelligence and AFOSI communities to collaborate and conduct IPOE; the
goal being to leverage information to support the timely identification of indicators and warnings
of emerging localized threats. The IFC and its products are the primary information sources that
directly support the DFC in making immediate, proactive decisions for ID planning.
Intelligence Oversight (IO)—Program developed to ensure that government entities conducting
intelligence activities do not infringe on or violate the rights of US persons and operate within
assigned legal parameters. Reference AFI 14-104, Oversight of Intelligence Activities.
Intelligence Preparation of the Operating Environment (IPOE)—A systematic, continuous
process of analyzing the threat and environment in a specific geographic area. It is designed to
support staff estimates and military decision-making.
Law Enforcement Information—Information provided by any agency chartered and
empowered to enforce laws in CONUS; a state or political subdivision of the US; a territory,
possession or political subdivision of the US; or within the borders of a host nation. Law
Enforcement Sensitive (LES) information specifically refers to unclassified FOUO information
that may be used in criminal prosecution and requires protection against unauthorized disclosure
to protect sources and methods, investigative activity, evidence and the integrity of pretrial
investigative reports.
Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT)—Intelligence obtained by quantitative
and qualitative analysis of data (metric, angle, spatial, wavelength, time dependence, modulation,
plasma, and hydro-magnetic) derived from specific technical sensors for the purpose of
identifying any distinctive features associated with the emitter or sender, and to facilitate
subsequent identification and/or measurement of the same. The detected feature may be either
reflected or emitted. (JP 2-0)
Operational Control—Transferable command authority that may be exercised by commanders
at any echelon at or below the level of combatant command. Operational control is inherent in
combatant command (command authority). Operational control may be delegated and is the
authority to perform those functions of command over subordinate forces involving organizing
and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and giving
authoritative direction necessary to accomplish the mission. Operational control includes
authoritative direction over all aspects of military operations and joint training necessary to
accomplish missions assigned to the command. Operational control should be exercised through
the commanders of subordinate organizations. Normally this authority is exercised through
subordinate joint force commanders and Service and/or functional component commanders.
Operational control normally provides full authority to organize commands and forces and to
employ those forces as the commander in operational control considers necessary to accomplish
assigned missions. Operational control does not, in and of itself, include authoritative direction
for logistics or matters of administration, discipline, internal organization, or unit training.
Phoenix Ravens/Flyaway Security Team (FAST)—The Phoenix Ravens and FAST Programs
are designed to ensure adequate protection for aircraft transiting airfields where security is
unknown or deemed inadequate to counter local threats. Teams of two to four specially trained

Priority Intelligence Requirement (PIR)—Intelligence requirements for which a commander
has an anticipated and stated priority in the task of planning and decision-making.
Terrorism—The calculated use of unlawful violence or threat of unlawful violence to inculcate
fear; intended to coerce or to intimidate governments or societies in the pursuit of goals that are
generally political, religious, or ideological.
Terrorism Threat Level—An intelligence threat assessment of the level of terrorist threat faced
by US personnel and interests in a foreign country. The assessment is based on a continuous
intelligence analysis of a minimum of four elements: operational capability, intentions, activity
and operational environment. There are four threat levels: LOW, MODERATE, SIGNIFICANT
and HIGH. Threat levels should not be confused with force protection conditions. Threat level
assessments are provided to senior leaders to assist them in determining the appropriate local
force protection condition. Department of State and Department of Homeland Security also
make threat assessments, which may differ from those determined by Department of Defense.
Threat Assessment—Analytic products produced by the OSI to address the threat posed by
espionage, international terrorism, subversion, sabotage, assassination, and covert activities.
This includes other activities that have a foreign intelligence entity (FIE) nexus. Reference DoD
Instruction 5240.18, Counterintelligence (CI) Analysis and Production, November 17, 2009.
Threat Working Group (TWG)—An advisory body that meets at least quarterly or more
frequently to develop and refine terrorism threat assessments and coordinate and disseminate
threat warnings, reports, and summaries. TWG membership is determined by the commander
and typically is anchored by ATO, AFOSI, Intel, and Security Forces, but may include members
of the staff such as Medical, Communications, Civil Engineering and Operations tenant unit
representatives; and appropriate representation from local, State, Federal, and host-nation law
enforcement agencies as needed depending upon the threat. Further guidance for the TWG is
found in AFI 10-245, DoDI 2000.16, DoD Antiterrorism (AT) Standards, October 2, 2006.
Tier 1 (T-1)—Non-compliance puts Airmen, commanders or the USAF strongly at risk of
mission or program failure, death, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable fraud, waste or abuse.
T-1 waiver requests may be granted at the MAJCOM/CC level, but may not be delegated lower
than MAJCOM Director, with the concurrence of the publication's approving official. (AFI 33-
360)
Tier 2 (T-2)—Non-compliance has the potential to create moderate risk of mission or program
degradation or failure, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable fraud, waste or abuse. Waivers
may be granted at the MAJCOM/CC level, but may not be delegated lower than MAJCOM
Director. (AFI 33-360)
Tier 3 (T-3)—Non-compliance has a relatively remote potential to create risk of mission or
program degradation or failure, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable fraud, waste or abuse.
Waivers may be granted at the Wing/DRU/FOA/CC level. (AFI 33-360)
US Persons—The term “United States Person” applies to the following: 1. A United States
citizen; 2. An alien known by the DoD intelligence component concerned to be a permanent
resident alien. A permanent resident alien is a foreign national lawfully admitted into the United

States for permanent residence; 3. An unincorporated association substantially composed mostly
of United States citizens or permanent resident aliens; 4. A corporation incorporated in the
United States, except for a corporation directed and controlled by a foreign government or
governments.
Vulnerability Assessment—A Department of Defense-, command- or unit-level evaluation of
the extent to which an installation, unit, exercise, port, ship, residence, facility, or other site
would be vulnerable to a terrorist attack. Identifies areas that could be improved to withstand,
mitigate, or deter acts of violence or terrorism.
